@entity0 -- is president @entity2 seriously considering pulling all @entity4 troops from @entity5 by next year or is just a sign of his frustration with @entity5 president @entity8 ? there 's no doubt that @entity2 has had his fill of dealing with @entity8 's on - again , off - again negotiations over how many troops would remain in the country after 2014			1
and there 's no doubt that the relationship continues to deteriorate , @entity1 chief national correspondent @entity15 said			0
" you can talk to senior officials going back into the @entity23 administration , they would tell you dealing with @entity8 is sometimes like dealing with a child -- he 's unpredictable , he changes his mind -- so that 's part of it , " @entity15 said			1
" so if @entity8 does n't trust his own security forces , you lay this down that we might come back to a zero option , maybe you snap him into thinking , ' " i 'd better get to get back to the negotiating table here , ' " @entity15 said			2
@entity2 strongly considering complete pullout from @entity5 the tough - love approach has become the standard negotiating tactic with @entity8 , @entity1 foreign affairs reporter @entity36 said			1
" they 're still hammering out a deal for the long - term @entity4 numbers and they know @entity8 really does n't want to be left standing alone			2
" @entity4 and @entity5 officials had been discussing a residual force in the country post- 2014 to fight insurgents and train @entity5 security forces			1
but the relationship between the two countries soured further last month after the @entity4 and the @entity50 planned peace talks and in response , @entity8 cut off negotiations			1
the @entity54 said no decision has been made and talks continue			0
" we continue to work through issues , " @entity54 spokesman @entity57 said , adding , " we believe we can work through them			0
" @entity8 does hold a bargaining chip in that a complete pullout would put the @entity4 at a strategic disadvantage in a volatile region			2
opinion : abandon @entity5 ? a dumb idea " think about the past decade , look at a map : it 's inconceivable to think there would n't be some kind of a @entity4 residual force in @entity5 to look across the border to @entity73 , " @entity15 said			1
" but remember , for anyone who thinks this is impossible , it is improbable to have zero , but if you think it 's impossible , i give you one example : @entity81 -- everyone thought we 'd leave a force there and we did n't			1
" the zero option is not without precedent for @entity2			0
the refusal by the @entity81 government to extend legal protections for @entity4 troops after the end of the war there was a major reason the @entity4 military left the country with no residual military training force			1
share your view on @entity5 the other part of the equation is @entity2 's relationship with his generals , @entity15 said			2
" there 's also a big debate about this within the @entity54			0
the generals are debating how many troops to leave behind , what 's the composition of the force			2
so the president is also serving notice to the @entity54 here -- ' i 'm going to keep the zero option , ' " @entity15 said			0
the @entity54 clearly would like to leave some troops in the country and that has been the plan all along , @entity1 senior pentagon correspondent @entity116 said			0
" but if @entity8 wo n't negotiate an arrangement , then they simply ca n't stay			0
" perhaps the biggest loser in the standoff could be the intelligence community , which would need to keep tabs on @entity126 in @entity5 and @entity73 without the help of @entity4 forces on the ground			1
logistically , it is possible to get all @entity4 troops out of the country by the end of 2014 but those decisions would need to be made now			2
" we need to know sooner rather than later , " a @entity136 official told @entity1			0
if @entity2 were to order a complete pullout , then the @entity136 would have to establish schedules for troop withdrawals , shutting down bases , and shipping home equipment over the next 18 months , said an @entity136 official who asked not to be identified because no decisions have been made			0
it would also change schedules for troop rotations -- the @entity136 is getting to the point that it would need to even out its schedule so that there are n't troops headed to @entity5 late in 2014 only to come home a few months later , the official said			1
ultimately , the @entity4 will make it 's decision based on its own national security interests , @entity36 said			0
" they are n't going to make a decision like that based on whether @entity8 is more frustrating than usual - especially since they always find him frustrating , " she said			0
" not having any troops in @entity5 -- particularly special forces -- adjacent to @entity73 and @entity163 , among others would put the @entity4 at a strategic disadvantage			1

negotiations between the @entity4 and @entity5 over post- 2014 troop levels have deteriorated
those who have dealt with @entity5 president @entity8 say it 's sometimes ' like dealing with a child '
the @entity4 planned to leave some residual force in place to fight insurgents and train @entity5 forces
the @entity4 planned to leave troops in @entity81 after the war but pulled all out after talks *stalled*
