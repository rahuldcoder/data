-- on tuesday , new @entity2 ceo @entity1 is expected to help unveil @entity2 's latest iphone at its first big event since co-founder @entity5 stepped aside in august			1
@entity1 will no doubt be scrutinized for how he fulfills his new role tuesday as chief pitchman for @entity2 's products			1
and the new @entity3 , expected to go on sale sometime in mid-october , will almost certainly draw lines of shoppers outside @entity2 's stores			1
then the question becomes : can @entity2 make enough iphones fast enough ? as demand for its gadgets continues to skyrocket , keeping @entity2 growing at its amazing pace will be a key hurdle for @entity1 's regime			1
the consumer shift toward cheaper , portable computers -- and @entity2 's huge success there with the @entity3 and @entity23 -- means creating and selling an ever - increasing number of devices each year			1
right now , for example , @entity2 will have to ramp up production of millions of new iphones , and possibly new @entity28 , for the holidays			0
after that there will be more @entity32 , @entity33 , and other products			0
it 's important that @entity2 's new devices be stylish and technically impressive			1
but it 's equally important that they be in stock when people want to buy them , something that @entity2 has n't always been able to deliver			2
only recently , for example , has the @entity23 supply been able to meet demand			0
and as time goes on , thanks in part to new markets such as @entity51 , demand for each gadget will only grow			0
it 's not enough for @entity1 and his team to keep coming up with exciting new products			0
they also must continue @entity2 's logistics revolution , so that consumers do n't have to wait forever to buy new @entity2 devices -- or turn instead to the competition			1
consider the total number of devices @entity2 must now have built and shipped per year			0
in 2011 , including all @entity3 , ipods , @entity32 , and @entity33 , @entity2 could end up shipping more than 175 million gadgets -- some 50 million more than it did last year , representing roughly 40 % growth			1
next year , @entity2 is expected to ship an all - time high of around 215 million devices , or another 40 million more than this year			2
it would n't be insane for @entity2 to have to ship 500 million units per year by the end of the decade			2
so @entity1 will have to figure out how to become the type of company that can ship 500 million gadgets per year -- from staffing to product design to @entity77 server infrastructure to components to manufacturing , sales and support			1
the good news : @entity1 is already , arguably , the best in the business when it comes to this stuff			0
over the past decade , he 's made @entity2 's supply chain an industry leader			2
for @entity1 and @entity2 's svp of operations @entity90 , the plan is to keep it that way			1
( see @entity93 's recent profile of @entity90 here			0
) as @entity2 enters its next chapter , some of @entity1 's biggest practical challenges will include scaling production , deciding how to prioritize the company 's existing businesses and figuring out which new businesses to enter -- such as making tvs			2
( then there 's the whole " vision thing , " which is a whole different challenge -- and where @entity5 , the master innovator , may prove to be irreplaceable			0
) later this month , @entity1 will make his first pitch to @entity107 as @entity2 's ceo , as @entity2 reports its quarterly results			1
a year from now , we 'll be in good position to judge his performance at the helm of the world 's most valuable tech company			0
but first , it 's time for a new iphone			0
