-- " i 'm thinking of throwing a little party , " i tell my pal @entity1 as i hold the phone with one hand and fold a mountain of laundry with the other			1
two friends make @entity11 promise not to flambé anything this time			1
" no big thing , really , just a few old friends getting together for the holidays , " i persist over the dead silence on the other end of the receiver			1
" maybe you and @entity20 , me and @entity21 , and four or five other people who -- " " @entity20 and i ca n't make it , " she answers before i can finish			2
" but i have n't given you the date			2
" " look , @entity11 , you know i 've had health issues , " she counters nervously			1
i explain to @entity1 that the @entity30 has yet to classify " exceedingly dry cuticles " as the kind of condition that requires actual bed rest			2
" still ... " she mutters as her voice trails off			2
that night in bed , i turn to @entity21 ( love of my life , father of my child , official party co-host )			1
" @entity43 , i was thinking it 's time we throw a little party , " i venture			1
" that sounds great , sweetheart			2
" " really , pumpkin ? " " of course , angel			2
i do have one small request , though			2
" " anything , honey			2
" he lifts his head and hands me his pillow			2
" put this over my face and then hold it there until , oh , i do n't know ... let 's say , i stop moving			1
" there are lots of areas in which i excel			2
as i 've already mentioned , i can fold laundry with one hand			2
i 'm also quite capable of catching the cold of just about anybody living within my zip code			2
@entity8 : how to face your inner perfectionist i have the kind of magnetism that wordlessly beckons a guy wearing half a cantaloupe on his head to come sit next to me during long subway rides			1
and , though i 'm hard - pressed to explain exactly how i do it , i possess an almost mystical ability to purchase appliances , furniture , and clothing approximately six minutes before the extremely pricey item goes on sale			0
the thing i ca n't do is host a genuinely wonderful party			1
i attempt to invite several other friends , but one has elected to schedule elective surgery for that date ( you know you 're in trouble when a friend would rather have her hammertoes corrected than have dinner at your place ) ; one claims our last brunch was like " a hostage situation with lox " ; one -- and you know who you are -- pretends to be her own housekeeper , repeating , " i sorry , no @entity107 " over and over ; and two different people choose not to attend but still make me swear that i wo n't flambé anything again ... like it 's my fault they could n't get their eyebrows to grow back after the crêpes @entity113 incident of 2005			1
i crawl into bed that night a broken woman			0
" why do i suck at parties ? " i ask @entity21			0
" is this one of those trick questions like when you ask me if you need to lose weight and i say , ' well , i suppose we could all stand to drop a pound or two , ' and you spend the next 36 hours likening me to @entity124 ? " i make a mental note to explore why i suck at relationships on some future night			0
" no , " i insist , " i really want to know what i 'm doing wrong			0
give it to me straight , @entity129 , i can take it			0
" he smiles and puts his book aside			0
" that 's just it ; the only thing you 're doing wrong is constantly striving to do everything exactly right			1
you want the prettiest cocktail , the freshest flowers , candles lit , music playing , dinner timed , conversation sparkling , and you drive yourself and everybody else nuts trying to achieve it			1
" @entity8 : a lesson for the reluctant hostess i would like to be the kind of person who receives this information with an open mind and a grateful heart			1
but my first instinct is to take my boyfriend of 15 years up on his previous offer and smother him to death with his own orthopedically correct goose - down pillow			1
the problem is , i know he 's right			1
i am part geisha girl , part drill sergeant , with just a soupçon of control freak thrown in for good measure			0
i want everyone to relax and have a good time , but that has to start with me , and i 'm about as laid - back as a caged hummingbird guzzling a can of @entity170 while awaiting biopsy results			1
you can keep your meditation , your reflexology , your gin , your tonics -- i 'm just not the mellow type			0
i approach a petite @entity179 woman from the @entity180 to figure out when this started			0
" @entity182 , have i always been a perfectionist ? " she attempts diplomacy			1
" well , let me put it this way -- you used to like to dress up in my clothes when you were maybe 3 or 4 years old			0
" " what does that prove ? lots of little girls play dress - up			0
" " @entity194 , " she says , " but you tried to bulldoze @entity196 into tailoring the clothes to actually fit you			0
" " well , excuse me for realizing that a skirt should hit just above my knee			0
" we are quiet for a minute			0
" so how do you throw a really fun party ? " she reminds me that they used to hire @entity205 for my birthdays			1
i remind her that @entity205 chain - smoked and seemed to hate children			0
" yes , that 's what your dad and i always liked best about him , " she deadpans			1
" anyway , the only thing i know about giving a party is that we can never get the extra leaf into the dining table and i usually forget to serve one of the side dishes			1
" this leads me to a new theory : " maybe bad parties are hereditary , like green eyes and diabetes , " i say to @entity21			0
" okay , that 's it , " he announces , grabbing the phone			1
before i can lunge at him , he has dialed our neighbors @entity227 and @entity228 and invited them to come for dinner " in about 15 minutes			1
" " are you insane ? " i shriek as i stuff everything littering the floor and coffee table under the sofa			0
" this is grounds for divorce , " i bellow , only to be reminded that we never got married			0
" that 's because i do n't know how to throw a wedding , " i hiss as i pull off my stained sunday night yoga pants and rummage through the laundry bag for my slightly less stained saturday afternoon yoga pants , marveling all the while at the fact that i do n't do yoga			1
needless to say , @entity228 and @entity227 are four minutes early			0
" hey , guys , can i offer you ... " i do a quick scan of the refrigerator , " a dollop of mayonnaise ? " i have hit rock bottom			0
somewhere @entity253 hangs her head in shame			0
@entity21 gives me a hug			0
there is no place to go but up			0
our neighbors split a diet @entity261 , we order in @entity264 food and proceed to talk and laugh and pass chicken satay for three straight hours			0
what can i say ? it is , to date , our most successful dinner party			1
