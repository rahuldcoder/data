@entity0 took up one of the most divisive issues in politics thursday as the @entity4 rejected a controversial measure banning abortions based on the sex of a fetus			1
in the @entity4 , 246 representatives backed the bill while 168 voted against it , leaving the proposal short of the two - thirds total necessary for passage			1
most @entity15 supported the measure ; the majority of @entity17 opposed it			1
supporters characterized the proposal as a necessary defense of the civil rights of unborn children ; opponents called it part of a broader so - called war on women and an ongoing assault on legalized abortion			1
the @entity29 would have imposed possible fines and prison sentences of up to five years on doctors who knowingly perform abortions chosen on grounds based on sex			1
abortion providers could also have been subjected to civil penalties , including punitive monetary damages , under certain circumstances			2
@entity41 poll : ' pro-choice ' at a record low the issue is about " whether or not in the land of the free and the home of the brave that we are going to allow little girls to be killed before they 're born simply because they are little girls , " rep. @entity45 , @entity46 , said thursday morning			2
@entity45 was the bill 's main sponsor			1
" i would suggest to you that if that should become the accepted practice in @entity59 -- that we are no longer going to care about that -- then maybe it 's time to board ( @entity0 up ) and go home and say we did our best but we just did n't quite make it			2
" rep. @entity62 , @entity63 , said that " most people in government are unaware " that abortion based on the sex of a fetus " is part of a deliberate plan of population control that has now boomeranged and come to our own country			0
" " this is the real war on women , " he insisted			0
rep. @entity76 , @entity77 , argued wednesday that it 's " hypocrisy to say that one is pro-woman and that it 's ok to end the life of an unborn child just because of its gender			0
" " since when did @entity59 subscribe to the idea that males are worth more than females ? " she asked			0
" it 's sick , it 's discriminatory , it 's sexist and it is blatantly anti-woman and anti-human			0
" women 's rights : nuns ' fight with @entity94 highlights @entity96 's global struggle supporters of the measure cited multiple studies to back claims of a growing pattern of abortions based on the sex of the fetus			1
opponents , however , took issue with certain interpretations of the studies , and warned of negative ramifications for women 's health if the bill becomes law			2
@entity112 rep. @entity111 , the top @entity113 on the @entity114 , asserted wednesday that the bill " tramples ( on ) the rights of women under the guise of nondiscrimination , while doing absolutely nothing to provide women with needed resources for their babies , female and male			1
" citing opposition to the bill from groups such as the @entity0 , he said , " if this measure is passed into law , we will then require that medical and mental health professionals violate ... doctor - patient confidentiality " and report suspected violations to law enforcement authorities			1
rep. @entity136 , @entity137 , said the bill 's backers were " exploiting serious issues like racism and sexism in a backdoor attempt to make abortion illegal			2
" " attempts to restrict or deny access to safe abortions is harmful to women 's health and would ultimately take us back to the days of back - alley abortions , " she said			1
@entity4 minority whip @entity150 , @entity151 , said nobody he has talked to favors abortion based on sex preferences , and the proposal was brought up simply " because somebody decided politically it was a difficult place to put people in			1
" @entity159 , a spokesman for @entity4 minority leader @entity160 , @entity137 , called the debate over the bill " yet another distraction and yet another day that this @entity15 majority fails to act on job creation			1
" but speaker @entity166 , @entity167 , said thursday that banning abortion based on the sex of a fetus is an " important issue to the @entity59 people			0
" " this type of sex selection ... most @entity59 find pretty repulsive , " @entity166 said			0
" our ( @entity15 ) members feel strongly about it			2
that 's why it 's being brought " to a vote			0
asked why the @entity15 - controlled @entity4 took up an abortion bill at a time when @entity15 leaders have called economic recovery their top concern , a spokesman for @entity166 insisted wednesday that the party 's priorities had not changed			1
@entity189 's new ad zeroes in on @entity190 " @entity192 are focused on the @entity59 people 's top priorities : jobs and the economy , " spokesman @entity191 said			0
" dealing with a bill to prevent sex - selective abortion ... does n't change that			1
" while @entity15 leaders would n't say why they brought up the bill under an expedited legislative process requiring a two - thirds vote for @entity4 approval , the maneuver avoided an extended argument over a divisive social issue with the potential to sidetrack the economic debate			1
@entity211 ' bill came to a vote at a time when abortion , a perennial hot - button topic , has re-emerged as a political focal point			1
the anti-abortion rights group @entity217 released two videos this week that is says shows @entity189 staffers offering advice to a pair of women involved in a sting on how best to proceed with an abortion based on the sex of a fetus			0
@entity189 , which provides a range of medical services for women , responded to the release of the videos by noting that one of the staff members in question -- a woman in @entity236 , @entity237 -- had lost her job because she failed to follow proper procedures for the organization			2
the organization insisted thursday in a written statement , however , that the second staffer , based in @entity243 , had provided " nonjudgmental , informative services that are in accordance with social work standards for patient interaction			0
" the statement noted that @entity189 " opposes sex selection abortion and insists on the highest quality care			0
... if any @entity189 organization learns of an instance where a staff member has not fully followed policies or procedures , they take swift action and remedy the situation			0
" at the same time , the statement blasted @entity217 's promotion of " a series of hoax patient videotapes related to sex selection			0
" " edited videos of hoax patient visits are part of a coordinated campaign over the last several years to distort @entity189 's services , mission and values , " the statement said			2
@entity189 's leadership jumped into the presidential contest wednesday , unveiling a roughly $ 1.5 million ad campaign targeting @entity15 presidential nominee @entity190			0
the ad , which says @entity190 would deny women critical medical services , is set to run in the battleground states of @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279 .			0
