" at @entity24 , there were tents set up outside the hospital , where i was stripped of my clothing , washed with water and several showers , before i was allowed into the hospital , " @entity9 said			2
" when i asked for my clothing , i was told that @entity8 had confiscated all of my clothing and it would not be returned			2
" the restraining order requests that @entity8 refrain from " altering , testing or destroying clothing or any other evidence or potential evidence " when workers become ill. @entity48 , a spokesman for @entity8 , said he could not comment on the restraining order , or on allegations that @entity8 confiscated clothing			1
he denied accusations from @entity52 , president of the @entity53 , that @entity8 has been threatening workers who speak out about health concerns			1
fishermen contacted by @entity2 have declined to speak publicly			0
some , who are making as much as $ 3,000 a day cleaning up the oil , have said they fear losing their jobs with @entity8			1
" the @entity8 oil spill wiped out their professions and their jobs this year and possibly years down the road , " @entity28 said			1

" it 's something we 've got to be very mindful of			0
it 's one of the big issues of keeping the @entity138 operating			0
you know , the @entity138 marches on their stomachs			0
" an expert on foodborne illness cast doubt on @entity127 's theory			0
" headaches , shortness of breath , nosebleeds -- there 's nothing there that suggests foodborne illness , " said dr. @entity145 , a professor at the @entity146			0
" i do n't know what these people have , but it sounds more like a respiratory illness			0
