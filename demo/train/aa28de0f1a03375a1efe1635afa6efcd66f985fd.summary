-- millions of people are expected to go to @entity2 to celebrate @entity4 's inauguration on january 20 , but with a troubled economy and pocketbook issues on the mind , the president - elect must be careful to set the right tone			1
construction of the inaugural stand continues in front of the @entity13 last week			0
president @entity14 raised a record $ 42.8 million dollars for his second inauguration , and according to @entity16 , more than 90 percent of the donations to that ceremony were from executives or corporations			1
but this year , some say throwing a multimillion - dollar party would be unseemly in a time when crash , bailout , and foreclosure fill the economic headlines			0
" a lot of it is about tone and making sure that the celebrations that do take place are not over the top , that they do n't appear to be insensitive to the pain people have right now , " said @entity28 , president of @entity29			1
the inaugural committee for @entity4 and vice president - elect @entity40 has pledged to make sure the ceremony underscores the incoming administration 's " commitment to change business as usual in @entity2			1
" the @entity45 has limited individual contributions to $ 50,000			1
there is no law restricting the size of donations , but in the past , inaugural committees have set contribution limits as high as $ 250,000			1
the @entity45 said it will not take contributions from corporations , political action committees , current federally registered lobbyists , non- @entity57 citizens or registered foreign agents			0
@entity4 has promised to " take power away from the corporate lobbyists " -- a pledge that would be questioned should the president - elect rely on them to foot his inauguration bill			1
" if he can pay for these parties with small donations , i think there 'd be a lot more acceptance of that , " @entity28 said			2
watchdog groups say there are some things @entity4 can do to take control of the tone			2
for example , he could make donations to charity , and @entity79 could opt for something more reasonably priced than a designer dress			2
when @entity82 took office , he also faced a financial crisis			0
he gave voters a now famous pep talk about the failing economy , then skipped the fancy inaugural balls because they sent the wrong message			2
but analysts say @entity4 's not expected to go that far because so many people want to celebrate his historic win			2
" @entity2 , was pro-obama and had @entity4 - mania long before november 4			2
but the moment november 4 occurred , all -- all craziness sort of broke loose , " said @entity93 , a gossip columnist for @entity94			0
as inauguration organizers work to keep the tone in check , they are speaking out against those trying to make money by scalping tickets to the event			1
tickets for the inauguration are distributed through members of @entity109 , and just 240,000 seats are available for the actual swearing - in ceremony			0
the tickets are supposed to be free , but with demand outpacing supply , a traditional giveaway has turned into a thriving online marketplace			0
legitimate ticket brokers -- the same companies that peddle tickets to rock concerts and @entity120 races -- are selling tickets to the inauguration for thousands of dollars , even for standing - room areas on the @entity123			1
@entity125 sen. @entity124 wants to make that practice a crime , punishable by up to a year in prison			0
organizers of the inauguration say it violates the spirit of the event and could spell disappointment for people who buy tickets for the ceremony			1
" we think it 's absolutely insane to be selling those tickets			0
we understand some people want to make a buck , but for those people thinking of buying tickets , it 's buyer beware , " warned @entity138 , staff director of the @entity139			0
@entity0 's @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 contributed to this report .			0
