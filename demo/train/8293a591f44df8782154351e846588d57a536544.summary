-- the federal government has reopened 4,281 square miles of federal waters off the coast of western @entity4 to commercial and recreational fishing , according to @entity6 , head of the @entity7			1
the region being reopened represents 7.4 percent of the total area in the @entity10 that had been closed off prior to friday			1
more than 48,000 square miles of federal waters -- roughly 20 percent of the total federal waters in the @entity10 -- remain closed to fishermen			1
at its height , the fishing ban resulting from the april 20 @entity16 oil rig explosion stretched over 88,000 square miles , or 37 percent of federal @entity10 waters , @entity6 noted			1
the western @entity4 waters represent the third area in the @entity10 to be reopened to fishing			1
a region off the @entity24 peninsula was reopened on july 22 , and another area off the @entity24 panhandle was reopened on august 10 , according to @entity6			0
officials are " nibbling at the edges " in terms of reopening the @entity10 waters after extensive testing , @entity6 said , starting with areas that were the least contaminated			1
" we feel completely confident that the ( @entity10 ) seafood that is in the market now is safe for human consumption , " she told reporters			0
but we will " continue to investigate the longer - term impacts this spill may have had			0
" @entity6 said that in order for an area of the @entity10 to be reopened , no oil can be present or expected to be present in the forseeable future			2
water samples taken from the area must pass both a sensory and chemical analysis			0
she also stated that the @entity7 -- in conjunction with the @entity49 -- will continue to test seafood from reopened areas of the @entity10			1
in a separate announcement , @entity4 officials stated that a project to monitor shrimp trawling vessels in @entity57 waters would conclude on friday			1
the project began on august 12			0
" we 've encountered dozens of shrimp vessels at work in @entity57 , " said @entity59 , an environmental scientist with the @entity60			2
" all vessels encountered ... have been inspected and no indications of oil have been noted on nets or in the catch			0
" the federal and state announcements came roughly three weeks after @entity16 plugged its crippled @entity72 oil well in the @entity10 with cement and mud from above			2
crews are currently " fishing " for pieces of drill pipe that need to be removed from inside the well 's blowout preventer before crews can move on to the " bottom kill " -- the permanent fix for the well			0
@entity84 , the man in charge of the government response to the @entity10 oil crisis , said wednesday that the " fishing " operations had been delayed by a buildup of hydrates -- chemicals that form at low temperatures and high pressures toward the sea floor -- that temporarily jammed the cap that trapped oil in the well starting on july 15			2
crews , however , have now flushed the system to loosen the cap , thereby allowing them to begin " fishing " through the top of the well again .			0
