-- @entity2 justice @entity1 is known for bold disagreement , conservative arguments , pointed questions and the occasional crude hand gesture , and still , it 's been an intense few months for one of the high court 's most polarizing figures , with biting insults hurled in his direction			1
last month , @entity1 dissented in the @entity14 @entity2 's 5 - 4 health care ruling , writing that the court undermined values of " caution , minimalism , and the understanding that the federal government is one of limited powers			1
" three days earlier , when the high court mostly rejected @entity27 's immigration law , @entity1 's minority opinion showed he was " more than usually outraged , " @entity0 senior legal analyst @entity23 said			1
in a solo dissent read from the bench , the 76 - year - old dressed down the @entity29 administration and suggested @entity27 would n't have entered the union if it had known how the ruling would come down : " if securing its territory in this fashion is not within the power of @entity27 , we should cease referring to it as a sovereign state			1
" while many call @entity1 a brilliant legal mind , his dissent on the court 's @entity27 immigration decision was accused of being too political , " more like a right - wing blogger or @entity48 pundit , " according to @entity45			1
the @entity49 called it " his churlish and self - aggrandizing and probably unethical tirade			0
" an opinion in @entity53 called @entity1 an " increasingly intolerant and intolerable blowhard : a pompous celebrant of his own virtue and rectitude " -- in short , the headline said , a " ranting old man			1
" @entity63 @entity62 opinion writer @entity61 called for @entity1 to resign			1
" @entity1 , by the end of the term , was apoplectic , " @entity65 publisher @entity64 told @entity66 this week -- and even that , @entity64 said , might be an understatement			1
" @entity1 cares so passionately about these issues that he wears his heart on his sleeve and the blood runs through his pen			2
" it 's hardly the first time the justice 's words and actions have sparked debate and criticism			1
he 's the longest - serving justice on the court currently , one who opposes abortion , gay rights and affirmative action			2
he advocates for separation of powers and consistently votes in favor of free speech , even when he does n't agree with what 's said			0
" if it were up to me and i were king , i would take scruffy , bearded , sandal - wearing idiots who go around burning the flag and put them in jail , " @entity1 once said of a decision that upheld the right to burn the @entity14 flag -- a decision he agreed with			2
in 2004 , he refused to recuse himself from a case involving @entity104 , even though he 'd gone duck hunting with the vice president when the court was considering an appeal involving @entity104 's energy task force			0
the same year , a @entity14 marshal guarding the justice confiscated a reporter 's tape recorder and erased comments he made at a @entity116 school			2
the @entity117 found the marshal had violated the law , and @entity1 apologized , but denied the seizure			1
sometimes , he need not bother with opening his mouth or picking up his pen : when confronted by a reporter outside a @entity124 church in 2006 , @entity1 used a certain @entity126 hand gesture some call vulgar			1
" i do n't think he cares , " @entity1 biographer @entity128 told @entity0 in 2009			2
" he 's got these intense feelings he 's not going to keep in check			0
" @entity1 was born in @entity132 , @entity133 , an only child who went on to have nine children of his own with his wife , @entity136			2
" @entity142 , " as friends and family call him , was the lone offspring of two immigrant @entity126 families and " the center of their universe , " said @entity128 , who published " @entity145 : the life and @entity147 of @entity2 justice @entity1 " in 2009			1
but that meant he carried the burden of his extended family 's attention and desire for success			0
he attended @entity154 and went on to practice law			0
he also taught law at the @entity157 , the @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 and work as an assistant attorney general and judge for the @entity164 before @entity165 nominated him to the @entity2			1
" i found the conflicts in terms of being a product of two different families continue to reveal himself , " @entity128 said			0
" the father was quite cerebral , was a professor , always had his nose in a book , he did n't abide any kind of silliness			0
and his mother 's side was much more flamboyant			0
you had these contrasting families , and , as i write in the book , he learned to deal with conflict and tension early on in his life , and went on to readily generate it as an adult			0
" his demeanor on the bench and in writing is n't a facade for the public , @entity128 said			0
" he actually is very confrontational behind the scenes , just as he is in public			0
but he also can be quite funny , quite casual , generous and decent , " @entity128 said			0
" his best friend on the bench is justice ( @entity197 " -- a low - key , liberal justice but , like @entity1 , a @entity199 who loves opera			1
" he 's many things			0
he 's very consistent on the law , but he 's a lot of things in terms of his personality , " she added			2
indeed , he has a reputation as a language appreciator and grammar geek , as well as a voracious questioner with fierce opinions about almost everything			0
@entity217 , a lawyer who collaborated with @entity1 on two books , 2008 's " making your case : the @entity219 , " and " @entity220 : the interpretation of legal texts , " told @entity221 they nearly a canceled the second text , released last month , over a disagreement about contractions like " do n't " and " ca n't			1
" while @entity217 found them acceptable , @entity1 " finds them ' intellectually abominable , but commercially reasonable			2
' " " @entity1 is an intellectual pugilist , throwing some very hard punches , " @entity217 told @entity221			0
his colleagues on the bench know his style well			0
in a 2011 tribute to @entity1 's 25 years on the bench , @entity233 noted @entity1 was nominated in 1986 " and the place has n't been the same since			1
" no other justices spoke during the tribute -- they just smiled			0
