-- @entity2 's narrow streets were once a dazzling gallery of neon , where banks and even bordellos plied their trade under sizzling tubular signs			1
but while the city 's nights remain bright , its fluorescent facades are fast disappearing as science and safety concerns make them obsolete			2
the lights are unlikely to go out completely , however , thanks to a new museum that hopes to preserve @entity2 's colorful past so that it can illuminate generations to come			1
@entity20 + , a state of the art " visual culture " museum due to open in 2017 has already acquired two classic 1970s neon logos -- one depicting a red rooster and the other a large cow			1
now it 's seeking public help to keep @entity2 's neon heritage ablaze			1
light bulb moment @entity32 , head curator of the museum 's art and design section , came across the rooster sign , the well known mascot of @entity2 's @entity39 schools , in 2013 while touring an area earmarked for redevelopment			1
that was to prove a light bulb moment			0
" it was a no - brainer for us to collect neon signs , " he says			2
" they are a marriage of craft and technology , as well as typography and graphic design			0
" they are used by artists and filmmakers as a lens for us to look at @entity2 visual culture			2
" to drum up interest in its new acquisition , @entity20 + is holding an online exhibition of @entity2 's neon signs			1
the show calls on the public to submit images and information on their favorites			0
the crowd - sourcing approach is more than just a digital - era gimmick -- it 's a necessity			2
" neon signage is a highly under - researched topic , " says @entity32			0
" we are asking the public to tell us what they know about them so we can document what is left			0
" fading neon glory the museum 's spotlight on neon is well timed since the signs are rapidly becoming obsolete in @entity2 , unlike 30 years ago when they supported a thriving industry			1
" there were so many orders we almost could n't handle it , " veteran neon craftsman @entity84 says in a video documentary by @entity20 +			0
those neon glory days are gone			0
@entity90 , the second generation owner of @entity2 signmakers @entity91 , says orders have decreased by 85 % since the 1970s			1
one reason is a government crackdown on illegal and unsafe structures that in 2009 led to the removal of about 5,000 signboards , many of them neon			2
" in the 1980s , whenever we had a serious typhoon , several signs would get blown down , " recalls @entity101 of @entity2 's @entity102 ( @entity102 )			1
" there has been an official campaign as early as the 1980s to remove illegal signage			0
this was n't only due to safety concerns			0
many of the signs removed in @entity113 and @entity115 districts were also related to prostitution			0
" the neon cow that will enter the m + collection was deemed unfit as , at 4.5 meters wide , it busts official size limits			2
in 2010 , authorities issued an ultimatum to the owner of @entity123 , the steakhouse where the cow had been hanging for three decades , to take it down or face a fine of up to hk $ 200,000 ( $ 25,000 ) and a year in jail			1
@entity101 , a curator for @entity2 's @entity128 before taking up post at the @entity102 , is sorry to see the cow go , but says : " life has to move on			1
today 's design is tomorrow 's history			0
" buzzing bulbs perhaps the biggest enemies of neon are its own idiosyncrasies			0
the lights are tricky and expensive to make , requiring a neon tube - bending technician and , for something like the neon cow , a budget of hk $ 250,000 ( $ 32,225 )			1
plus , that classic neon sign buzzing sound gets on some people 's nerves			2
the city 's streets continue to be bathed in fluorescence -- so much so that it 's considered the most light - polluted place in the world			0
but these days , @entity2 business owners who want their brand name up in lights opt for cheaper , energy efficient leds that lack the whimsy and extravagance of handmade neon			1
a push from mainland @entity162 to use @entity156 has also dimmed @entity2 's love of neon			1
" many cities in @entity162 no longer support neon signage and this inevitably affects @entity2 's businesses , " says @entity90			1
since led light is harsher than the soft glow of neon , it 's a trend that has worsened @entity2 's light pollution			1
it also creates other environmental issues since @entity156 , unlike neon , are n't normally repaired or reused.resurrects but the neon lights are n't going out for good			2
" it 's fairly safe to say neon 's heyday is over and not coming back , " says @entity32			2
" however , it is such a compelling medium and holds so many associations that artists , designers and filmmakers will continue to use it in their work			0
" @entity184 is increasingly being seen on its own terms			0
in terms of quantity , neon will recede			0
in terms of content , it is almost growing			0
