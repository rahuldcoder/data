the turmoil in @entity1 has swept aside its president , brought about the release a prominent opposition leader and raised fears the country could break apart			1
after the bloodshed in the streets of @entity9 last week -- the deadliest violence @entity1 has suffered since its independence 22 years ago -- the political twists and turns came thick and fast over the weekend			1
as a new week begins , uncertainty has taken a hold in the divided nation as @entity1 tries to reshape its political landscape			1
an arrest warrant has been issued for ousted president @entity20 over the killings of civilians , a government official said monday			1
but officials do n't know where he is			0
here 's what you need to know to get caught up : who 's in charge ? it depends whom you ask			0
the @entity32 voted to oust @entity20 , a key demand of protesters			1
it appointed seasoned lawmaker @entity36 as a new speaker who will take on @entity20 's duties until new elections in may			1
@entity36 , a longtime ally of opposition leader @entity40 , has promised a new interim government by tuesday			0
" we have a legitimate source of authority in @entity9 , which is the democratically elected @entity32 and a democratically , constitutionally elected speaker of parliament , who is acting president , " @entity43 foreign minister @entity42 , who helped broker a peace deal between the government and the opposition , said on @entity48 's @entity47			1
but @entity20 claims he 's still in charge , saying he was forced to leave @entity9 because of a " coup			1
" " i do n't plan to leave the country			0
i do n't plan to resign			0
i am the legitimate president , " he said saturday in a televised broadcast			0
but acting @entity1 interior minister @entity60 said monday that arrest warrant has been issued for @entity20			1
" as of this morning , a criminal case on mass killings of civilians has been opened			1
@entity20 and several other officials have been placed on the wanted list , " @entity60 wrote monday on his @entity66 page			2
where exactly is @entity20 ? unclear			2
he made his tv broadcast from @entity71 , a @entity72 stronghold near the border			0
and he reportedly tried to board a charter plane saturday night in the eastern city of @entity76 , but was turned away because he did n't have the right papers			0
on sunday , he was staying at his private residence in @entity79 in the southern region of @entity81 , @entity60 said , adding that @entity20 is believed to traveling in three vehicles with his chief of staff			1
but @entity60 said he does n't know where @entity20 was monday			2
he 's definitely not in his lavish presidential compound near @entity9 that thousands of @entity1 have now been able to explore after he fled			2
people have been roaming around the mansion and its vast grounds , staring at the opulence in which @entity20 lived , including peacocks , vintage cars and a huge galleon - style riverboat for parties			2
does the former president have any support left ? his political party appears to have turned against him , saying it blames him for the " robbery and deception " of the nation			0
it accused @entity20 of making illegal orders that led to casualties , financial debt and shame in the eyes of the world			2
but it 's notable that @entity20 was recently in @entity71 , in eastern @entity1			1
it 's his traditional support base and a predominantly @entity112 - speaking region			2
people in the east , the country 's industrial heartland , tend to look to @entity112 as @entity1 's key ally			1
many of them are suspicious of the @entity121 - leaning views of those in western @entity1 , who were at the heart of the protests against @entity20 that filled central @entity9 for months			1
the demonstrations began after @entity20 scrapped a @entity127 trade deal and turned toward @entity112 for financial support			1
does this mean @entity1 is in danger of splitting ? a lot of people with @entity112 heritage in eastern @entity1 feel that their cultural identity is under threat with the pro-european side in the ascendancy in @entity9			1
" i think that divide goes very , very deep -- it 's regional , it 's linguistic , it 's religious , " @entity140 columnist @entity139 , whose father grew up in @entity1 , told @entity48 's @entity142			2
in many parts of @entity1 , people have toppled statues of former @entity112 communist leader @entity150 , a founder of the @entity151			1
the statues are symbols of @entity112 pride			2
in @entity71 , a tense rift has opened up between those who want to tear down the city 's @entity150 statue , one of the biggest in the country , and those who want to keep it			0
some analysts say they fear parts of eastern @entity1 could push to break away from a @entity165 government in @entity9 in favor of @entity112			1
the task for @entity20 's opponents is to chart a course for @entity1 that keeps all sides on board			1
" they need to be inclusive , " said @entity43 's @entity42			0
acting president @entity36 said sunday that @entity1 is ready to talk to @entity173 to try to improve relations , but made clear that @entity9 's return to @entity177 integration would be a priority			1
how has @entity112 reacted to the political change ? @entity112 's ambassador to the @entity181 , @entity180 , condemned what he called @entity165 attempts to influence the outcome of the turmoil in @entity1			1
" either they do n't understand the consequences of what they 're doing , or they 're engaged in a very provocative game of destabilizing @entity1 and therefore @entity121 , " he said in a post on his official @entity188 account			1
the @entity112 foreign ministry says it has recalled its ambassador from @entity1 to @entity196 for consultations , citing " the aggravation of the situation			1
" everybody 's waiting to see what @entity112 president @entity201 , a key backer of @entity20 , does next			1
" if you look through @entity201 's eyes specifically , this is his area of interest , " said @entity204 , the editor of @entity205 and a former foreign correspondent in @entity196			2
@entity201 , whose country just finished hosting the @entity212 in @entity213 , wo n't quietly let @entity1 shift into a @entity165 orbit , @entity204 said			2
" i think @entity201 is in a very tough , assertive mode and it has nothing to do with snowboarding , it has to do with his geostrategic , regional interests , " he said			0
" it has to do with differentiating himself from the @entity165 , morally as well as politically , and i think he 's a very tough figure to deal with now			0
" what is the @entity225 stance ? national security adviser @entity226 warned that it " would be a grave mistake " if @entity201 intervened militarily in the crisis			0
" the @entity225 is on the side of the @entity1 people , " she said on @entity230 's " @entity229			2
" the people expressed themselves peacefully , she said , and @entity20 " turned on " the people by using violence against them			2
but @entity236 has a delicate task getting involved in a crisis in an area that @entity112 sees as its backyard			2
" this is really complicated for us , " @entity204 said			0
on sunday , @entity225 secretary of state @entity243 spoke with @entity112 foreign minister @entity244 about @entity1 , expressing support for the results of the @entity32 's decisions and asking @entity112 not to not use military force in the country , according to a senior @entity251 official			1
the @entity251 has warned @entity225 citizens to defer all non-essential travel to @entity1			2
@entity43 's @entity42 , meanwhile , urged @entity1 leaders to keep dialogue open with @entity196			1
" the new @entity1 government needs to be in touch , needs to have a conversation with @entity112 , which is an important neighbor , just like @entity43 , " he said			1
" because , apart from anything else , @entity1 needs the lower gas price and does n't want @entity112 to play the separatist card			1
" who 's likely to lead @entity1 next ? there are plenty of candidates but no clear favorite yet			2
@entity36 , who @entity32 appointed acting leader , is at the helm until elections on may 25			1
the @entity272 coalition is fractious , full of different voices			0
" the challenge for the opposition moving forward from here is going to be maintaining unity , " said @entity48 correspondent @entity274			0
who 's who in @entity1 former world champion heavyweight boxer @entity280 has been the most well - known opposition figure during the crisis			2
he heads the @entity283 party			0
there 's also @entity285 , a former foreign minister			0
what about @entity40 ? former prime minister @entity40 , considered a hero of a 2004 revolution against @entity20 , was released saturday after 2Â½ years behind bars			1
she had lost to @entity20 in elections in 2010			0
a year later , she was sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with @entity112			1
after her release , she addressed cheering crowds in @entity9 's @entity297 , calling @entity20 a " terrible dictator			0
" she then passed on a not - so - subtle message			0
" there 'll be no @entity1 but the @entity1 you want , " she said			0
" and i 'm the guarantor of that @entity1			0
" she said sunday that she does n't want to be considered for the nomination for prime minister , suggesting she may have her eye on the presidency			1
but some observers say the protests in @entity9 have fed a desire for a new , untainted generation of leaders to step forward			0
" a lot of people who made this revolution feel like this movement has created a lot of new leaders , a lot of young leaders -- that now it 's their turn , " @entity322 , senior editor at @entity323 , told " @entity324			0
" how did the changes come about ? the unrest began november , when @entity20 turned his back on trade talks with the @entity127			0
instead , @entity112 offered to lend money to @entity1 in a deal worth billions of dollars and lower the gas prices it charges			1
the @entity333 economy is struggling , plagued by corruption , inefficiency and heavy government debt			0
but the pact with @entity112 prompted protesters into the streets of @entity9			0
they stayed in the center of the city for months in a standoff with security forces that occasionally flared into the violence			0
the situation worsened dramatically last week as clashes between the two sides intensified and gunfire broke out , leaving 88 people dead			0
amid the chaos on the streets , foreign diplomats stepped up efforts to find an agreement between @entity20 and the opposition to end the fighting			0
on friday , the intense negotiations resulted in a breakthrough deal to reduce the president 's powers and roll back parts of the @entity362 , which gave them to him			0
@entity20 then left the capital and security forces withdrew from key protest areas -- setting in motion the changes that unfolded over the weekend .			0
