-- the @entity3 dissident @entity2 's daring and extraordinary escape to the @entity5 embassy in @entity6 has captivated the world			1
at first , it appeared that @entity5 diplomats and the @entity3 government brokered a deal that satisfied @entity2 and everyone involved			1
but now @entity2 says he wants to leave @entity3 , and that he feels unsafe			1
has the @entity14 administration bungled his case ? did president @entity14 use people who were capable of correctly interpreting the signals in @entity3 ? or was there a gap in translation ? possible breakthrough for blind activist we learned earlier this week that @entity2 was released from the @entity5 embassy with the @entity3 government 's assurance of his " safety " and a promise to facilitate his study of law in an unspecified place outside his home province of @entity33			1
it sounded like a win - win solution			0
but those who have intimate knowledge of @entity3 and its political system had reasons to worry			2
in many ways , the deal was almost made to be broken , because it was based on three erroneous assumptions on the part of @entity5 officials			1
the first false assumption is that the @entity3 government 's assurances are ironclad			2
to be sure , there has to be some trust among negotiators			0
but the @entity3 government has meted out overly harsh treatment to dissidents in recent years			2
what confidence do we have that it will make an exception in @entity2 's case ? the @entity5 trust that the @entity3 government will honor its promises was misplaced , if not outright @entity60 ve			1
behind the scenes of the @entity2 drama second , @entity5 officials assumed the word " safety " means the same thing for both sides			1
the @entity3 negotiators may have had a totally different arrangement in mind when they spoke of safety			0
for them , @entity2 was " safe " when he was confined in his home in @entity33 , surrounded by armies of security guards			0
third , the @entity5 should not have thought of the case as just zealous local @entity33 officials abusing their power when they confined @entity2			1
it is hard to believe that @entity33 officials did what they did to @entity2 , a high profile activist , without consent from above			0
that local officials from elsewhere will not abuse their power is hard to believe			0
would @entity2 not be viewed as a threat to " stability " by his handlers once he enters a @entity3 university ? some @entity3 observers have pointed out that @entity2 can only blame himself for insisting to stay in @entity3 as a cornerstone of the deal			1
they are disappointed by his change of mind			0
@entity2 certainly knows the @entity3 political system the best among those involved in the negotiation			2
so he should have expected the threats he may face if he stays in @entity3			0
but , for a blind and ill person who had just escaped from a long detention with little contact with the outside world , is n't it too much to ask that he make the most rational decision ? and how could he opt to leave @entity3 when his family was in the hands of @entity3 officials who could have caused them harm ? there is no easy fix to the predicament			0
taking @entity2 out of @entity3 would have been a good solution , but that possibility may be receding			2
the @entity5 officials who were involved with the negotiations should have recognized the potential problems in the deal and expected the treatment that @entity2 would encounter after leaving the @entity5 embassy			1
if they are not well equipped to do so ( despite the fact that some of them are ethnically @entity122 ) , then where are their @entity3 hands ? while we do n't know how the @entity2 case will ultimately turn out , for the @entity5 , it 's time to think strategically of enlisting more advisers from a new generation of @entity3 scholars			1
there are political scientists teaching at elite universities in the @entity5 who are more than qualified to advise the @entity133 on sensitive diplomatic issues			0
these scholars were born and grew up in @entity3 and may have worked in the @entity3 government before coming to the @entity5			2
they have expertise on @entity3 politics and society that is hard to come by , because they can see things from the perspective of the @entity3			0
in the coming years , the @entity5 will have more success in dealing or negotiating with @entity3 if it recruits more experts who really understand how @entity3 works			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity145 .			0

the deal the @entity5 and @entity3 made over @entity2 appears to be *unraveling*
@entity145 : has the @entity14 administration bungled his case ?
he says the deal was almost made to be broken because the @entity5 made false assumptions
su : @entity5 will have more success in negotiating with @entity3 if it recruits more @entity3 experts
