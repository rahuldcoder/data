@entity0 -- soccer star @entity2 and his father testified in a @entity5 court friday in a preliminary hearing over allegations they defrauded @entity10 tax authorities of more than $ 5 million			1
prosecutors filed charges last june			0
@entity2 has denied any wrongdoing , and last august he and his father paid $ 6.75 million in back taxes plus interest			1
but a prosecution spokesman told @entity1 by phone that they still had to appear in court because they are potentially liable , if the matter goes to trial and they are convicted , to pay a fine of $ 10 million to $ 32 million and could be sentenced to up to four years in jail			1
the complaint centers on alleged tax fraud during 2007 , 2008 and 2009			1
prosecutors contend @entity2 and his father , aiming to lower their @entity10 tax bill , sought to manage the player 's lucrative income from image rights through shell companies set up overseas			1
@entity2 , 26 , has a yearly salary from his club , @entity5 , of just over $ 20 million plus around $ 21 million in endorsements from sponsors including @entity37 and @entity38			1
" we have always fulfilled all our tax obligations , following the advice of our tax consultants , who will take care of clarifying this situation , " @entity2 posted on his @entity40 page last june			2
his father , @entity48 , was first to arrive on friday at a court in @entity50 , a @entity5 suburb chosen because the soccer star 's home is within its jurisdiction			1
@entity2 , a four - time world player of the year , arrived later and video images of the scene showed a crowd gathered to cheer on , and seek autographs from , the star who 's helped @entity5 stay atop the @entity10 league standings this season			2
the closed - door hearings were held before an investigating magistrate and included prosecutors , the @entity64 and their lawyers , and a lawyer for @entity10 's tax authority , said the prosecution spokesman			2
@entity2 testified for about 30 minutes and his father , for about an hour , earlier and separately , said @entity70 , a reporter for @entity1 affiliate 8tv , who was outside the courthouse			2
after the hearings , the lawyer for the @entity74 , @entity73 , spoke briefly to reporters , promising total transparency and a willingness to collaborate and make sure taxes are paid , and adding that there had been no intent to defraud			0
" we were told to do only one thing : to collaborate with the administration to clear up the facts showing the economic data , " @entity73 said , according to a translation by @entity83			0
" the order we were given by the @entity2 family was to show transparency , clarity and collaboration			0
we proceeded as we did today with the only goal of showing transparency , and we have proven little aim for fraud and a clear will to regulate the situation with the @entity100 , in order to avoid any big fight with the state regarding the fiscal ruling			0
" the prosecution spokesman , who by custom is not identified , said that last wednesday , just two days before the hearing , @entity73 tried to reach an out - of - court settlement with prosecutors for the @entity64			0
prosecutors proposed that both @entity2 and his father would plead guilty to tax evasion in the hearing , and would likely be fined about $ 10 million and receive a one - year sentence , which would not require time in prison because they have no prior convictions , the spokesman said			1
but @entity73 said the @entity64 were opposed			0
he proposed that only the father would make such a plea , in exchange for prosecutors and the court relieving @entity2 of any responsibility			1
prosecutors would not accept that based on @entity10 law , the spokesman said			0
inside the court , @entity2 's father testified that he was in charge of the finances , and any blame would be his , and @entity2 was not involved , according to a prosecutor who talked to an ad hoc pool of @entity10 journalists , @entity70 said			2
@entity2 , who arrived at @entity5 as a 13 - year - old in 2000 , has won six @entity10 @entity139 titles and three @entity141 crowns and scored an unparalleled 86 goals for the club and his national team , @entity145 , in 2012			0
@entity5 has refused comment on the case .			0
