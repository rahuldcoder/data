@entity0 , @entity1 when violence swallows a city as wholly as it has @entity0 , as in so many of @entity1 's mottled cities , the fight becomes about who wins , rather than what is left for the victor			1
its streets have been so ground down to the bone , that the prize -- so small but so intensely fought over -- is now unrecognizable			2
every time you open your eyes in @entity0 , you see the damage			1
interactive : explore the devastation of this @entity1 city there are people still there , but it is hard to gauge how many			1
food is scarce , as is fuel for heat			1
and day and night , indiscriminate , homemade mortars rain down on @entity31 homes -- @entity33 borrowing a technique , it seems , from the @entity1 regime , and using domestic gas canisters and junk metal to kill or maim civilians			1
you can hear the clank of these metal shards bouncing on the street outside as you try to sleep			0
airstrikes by the @entity45 - led coalition against @entity33 -- often three thuds in rapid succession -- shake the very ground you are lying on			1
they have held @entity33 back , but not enough for the @entity50			1
from what we saw , the front lines appear much more toward the city 's center than some @entity31 advocates would suggest			1
to the city 's west , too , @entity33 fighters are nearer than sometimes advertised			1
this is a fight that is still in the balance			0
to the city 's east is the most hotly contested front line			0
we are led there by @entity68 , the pseudonym of a 22 - year - old @entity31 female fighter			1
in a testament to the egalitarian way the @entity50 live , she is this unit 's commander			1
she has been fighting @entity33 for two years -- almost since the @entity77 extremist group 's beginning			1
@entity33 fighters have been as close as five yards away from her			1
she has lost friends here , but also made them			1
' i resist to avenge their death ' " i lost a lot of friends in this war and i resist to avenge their death , " she tells me			1
" no matter the destruction in @entity0 , it can be built again -- the important thing is to destroy this strange enemy that entered our land			1
" the hardest loss to bear is that of her closest friend @entity93 early this year			0
the @entity50 have been fighting a lot longer than coalition airstrikes have been falling			1
" i lost my best friend eight months ago			0
she killed herself to save her friends and the injured around her , " @entity68 said			0
" these are the difficult moments that we live , but i told you we gain strength from these martyrs			0
they are difficult moments that make you do more to avenge their death to make her dreams come true			2
the road she began , you finish			0
" the death itself was heroic and chilling			0
@entity93 was surrounded but also injured			0
her fellow fighters were too			0
they had used all their ammunition			0
" @entity93 pulled back the injured			0
she advanced while injured and then @entity33 surrounded her			2
girls are very prized by @entity33			2
she killed a lot of them with her			0
her last words to me were : ' we will liberate our land with the last drop of blood in my body			0
' " breaking the rules amid all the machismo war usually generates , it is jarring to see the defense of this city performed by women in their early 20s			2
they are very emotionally in touch with each other , often hugging -- the polar opposite of @entity33 ' worldview			2
" @entity31 women 's resistance will show the world a new history of women in which ( women ) can break all the rules that have no real basis in customs or traditions , " said @entity68			2
but first , the fight for @entity0			2
she leads us through a series of holes made in the walls of buildings rendered skeletal by the fighting in the east			0
one official called the city " @entity165 , " after the city whose people and essence the @entity163 's @entity162 sacrificed to make a point			2
scavenged , aging weapons it is hard to know what will be left to celebrate once the fighting ends , but up on the gun position she takes us to , the intensity of the battle remains clear			0
heavy machine guns try to hit @entity33 in the rubble			2
@entity33 fighters lie dead in the no - man 's land between the two front lines -- distant in their decay from the glorious death of which @entity33 propaganda often talks			1
one navy machine gun jams repeatedly			0
this is a war the @entity50 are still fighting with aging , scavenged weapons , even though pinpoint munitions fall from coalition jets onto their common enemy			1
their fighters ' repeated plea is for better weaponry			0
across no - man 's land , you can hear @entity33 call out " @entity199 , " @entity196 is the greatest -- the group 's common rallying cry			1
the @entity50 , also @entity200 , mock it gently			2
their two views of civilization are almost millennia apart , but now separated by a stretch of icy mud , increasingly smaller than they would like			0
@entity2 's @entity207 contributed to this report .			0

weeks of fighting between @entity50 and @entity33 have devastated the @entity31 city of @entity0
some people remain but food and fuel are scarce and mortars rain down
female @entity31 fighters are among those battling @entity33 in the shell - *blasted* streets
" i lost a lot of friends in this war and i resist to avenge their death , " says one fighter
