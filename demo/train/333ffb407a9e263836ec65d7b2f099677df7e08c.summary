what 's a word for feeling the pressure of a deadline but also pleasure in meeting it ? i 've got it -- plessure			1
nowadays , it seems that a new portmanteau -- a word that is a combination of two words -- pops up every hour or so			1
you might have just met a frenemy for brunch -- a hybrid word going back decades -- where the two of you shared a cronut before distracting each other with a heated discussion of " @entity22			1
" who knows ? the discovery that you both experience spasms of affluenza could make for the beginning of a wonderful bromance			0
@entity29 , i 'm not about to go on a curmudgeonly rant denouncing hybrid words			1
on the contrary , perhaps they herald a new phase in @entity36 verbal creativity			0
invented by @entity38 chef @entity37 earlier this year , " cronuts " are a cross between croissants and doughnuts			0
in @entity44 , the pastry debuted in @entity37 's @entity46 shop to big crowds			0
they were such a hit that a black market on @entity51 sprang up where one cronut can fetch as much as $ 40			1
" @entity22 " is a @entity54 tv movie about -- you guessed it -- a tornado that tosses man - eating sharks out of the sea onto land			1
the hashtag @entity22 took @entity61 by storm			1
apparently , the word inspired the movie			1
is there a trend in the air ? familiar words are being reshuffled and transformed into dazzling new things			1
we throw old words into new configurations in a rush to keep up with our faster pace of life , the same way we throw on the clothes nearest to us , no matter how mismatched , if we have to rush out of the house			1
maybe it has something to do with technology			0
the mind reels as it tries to keep up with all the scintillating gadgets and toys			0
@entity85 and pcs seem so yesterday			0
even ims feel old compared to some of the newer chat programs			0
and now we have an explosion of apps where word play is child 's play			2
move over , @entity94 and @entity95 ; make way for @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			0
you have to wonder if there is n't a little bit of nostalgia in the portmanteau craze			2
it 's as if we are saying to all the changes : " hold on ! do n't throw the baby out with the bathwater ! " ( do n't be a ... throwbaby ? ) hybrid words come in many flavors			1
some have an undertone of irony , and even cynicism , to them : anticipointment , @entity116 , craptacular			0
twenty years ago , genetically modified food was the stuff of science fiction ; hence @entity116 was born			0
the concepts behind " craptacular " and " anticipointment " -- the disappointment we feel after the anticipation aroused by hype has been deflated by reality -- are the product of jaded intelligences that see through the commercial artifice around them			2
there is something almost decadent , and a little bit @entity134 , about our rising tide of portmanteaus			0
in the 17th century , a concept like " frenemy " might have been coined by some caustic @entity38 writer with an epigrammatic wit			0
you might even say that a hybrid is an epigram manque			2
but , then , we are in a cultural phase now that seems more conceptual and visual			0
words like " cronuts " or " @entity22 " conjure up hard - to - forget images			1
but will people remember them in 100 years ? it depends on whether the words ' meanings will still resonate with people			2
" @entity22 " will probably go the way of the movie it inspired , and cronut seems particularly well suited to @entity44 in 2013			1
but who knows ? @entity162 could stay with us as long we eat them			0
some words like metrosexual or screenager say a lot about the way we live			2
we 've all felt at one time or another as if we 've fallen through the looking glass into some strange new world , where what was familiar to us even five years ago has been turned on its head			2
it was , after all , @entity176 's @entity175 who first coined the word " portmanteau " and defined it : " two meanings packed up into one word			1
" unlike mr. @entity175 , however , we are kept together by our hybrid words , or at least enabled to rearrange the broken pieces of our familiar experience into something we understand			1
maybe the best thing about them is that , with their fusion of disparate words and ideas , they break down any notion of cultural purity			2
in the end , they capture the most humane promise of @entity36 life : the only way through is together			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			1

@entity201 : it seems that a new portmanteau -- a hybrid word -- pops up every hour
@entity201 : words like " cronut " and " @entity22 " delight and dazzle us in their newness
he says familiar words are being reshuffled as our modern life quickens in its pace
@entity201 : new hybrid words are *emblematic* of our culture -- a melting pot where things blend
