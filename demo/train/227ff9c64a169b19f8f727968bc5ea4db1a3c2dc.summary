@entity0 -- retired air force col. @entity2 is a @entity3 veteran			0
his wife , @entity4 , died in 2005 , but he did n't know where she was buried in @entity6 until last year			1
@entity2 blames the @entity7 , which runs @entity6 , and he told @entity8 on thursday to " keep after ' em. " @entity2 is among dozens of survivors whose loved ones were buried in wrong or mismarked graves			1
it 's an ongoing scandal at the nation 's most hallowed burial ground for its fallen service members			0
problems began in the early 1990s , according to a @entity19 investigation , and continue to this day with more revealed this week			0
@entity2 's wife , as the spouse of an eligible veteran , was supposed to be buried the grave site where @entity2 would eventually be buried			1
her headstone was on the grave			0
he placed flowers on that grave			0
" i even took her mother up there so she could see her daughter 's grave site , and all she saw was a headstone and an empty grave , " @entity2 said			2
it was empty because her remains , for some reason , were buried in a grave with the urn of a fallen staff sergeant			2
the staff sergeant was reburied elsewhere , @entity42 's coffin was left in that grave site and a new headstone was put on her real resting place			2
it 's stories such as the one @entity2 told thursday at a @entity48 hearing that had some lawmakers wondering if the cemetery 's control should be turned over to the @entity52 , which runs most of the nation 's military cemeteries			1
" we need to honor the sacred ground at @entity6 , and i can tell you that we need leadership that respects that , " rep. @entity59 , @entity60 , told @entity7 officials , who took over control of @entity6 10 months ago			1
" you really , fundamentally , at the end of the day do n't care			0
" @entity68 , executive director of the @entity7 's cemeteries program , and @entity71 , the cemetery superintendent who runs @entity6 's day - to - day operations , both insist they are doing their utmost to undo years of mismanagement			1
they took over after the previous managers retired in disgrace			0
the @entity7 reprimanded @entity77 , the longtime @entity6 superintendent , after the discovery of a number of problems with mismarked graves			1
@entity77 and his second - in - command , @entity82 , were allowed to retire last summer after the secretary of the @entity7 told @entity8 that @entity6 may have more than 200 mismarked graves			1
since then a criminal investigation has begun into cases of remains found improperly buried at @entity6 , and an inspector general 's probe is looking at the overall problems at the cemetery			1
neither investigation is complete yet			0
@entity94 said he believes the problems are bigger than the management			0
" this is an organization that is rotten to its core			0
this is an organization that has conducted itself -- really , i think the best way to describe it is a culture of incompetence , if not a culture of corruption			0
" @entity68 testified that she and @entity71 are trying to make sure each grave is properly marked			0
" when we check all the records with the actual grave site , that should identify where we may have potential discrepancies in the cemetery , " @entity68 said			2
" if we find a discrepancy , we will contact the families that are involved			0
" but there are 330,000 graves , and she admits that resolving each problem grave may be impossible			2
even contacting the families is not easy because the @entity7 does n't always have the latest contact information on survivors -- if there are any			2
@entity71 told committee members that having the @entity52 take over control of @entity6 would be a mistake			1
" @entity6 provides graveside service which @entity52 cemeteries do not			1
in addition , @entity0 , and @entity6 ( are among ) the most visited tourist spots in the country , " @entity71 said			2
" we average over 4 million visitors , who come to learn of the history and pay their respects			0
there is no other @entity52 cemetery like that			2
" referring to families who lost members in combat , @entity71 said , " the @entity146 parents that we 've met with ... felt quite passionately and adamantly that @entity6 should stay under the @entity7 and not become a @entity52 national cemetery			1
" on friday , for the first time since the @entity7 discovered where his wife is really buried and where her new headstone stands , @entity2 will go to visit the site			1
he said he wants the moment to be private , just between him and his " beautiful wife			0
" but when asked if the @entity52 should take over the cemetery where he will one day join his wife , @entity2 said , " they could n't do any worse			1

a @entity48 hearing *focuses* on problems at @entity7 - run @entity6
@entity8 was told last summer that cemetery may have more than 200 mismarked graves
some lawmakers wonder if @entity6 's control should go to @entity52
a *widower* whose wife was buried in the wrong grave says @entity52 " could n't do any worse "
