-- the people who died thursday at a spiritual resort in @entity3 had spent time in a " sweatbox " similar to what @entity6 and other cultures have used for prayer and purification rituals throughout history			1
two people died and were 19 injured after spending up to two hours inside this " sweatbox " at an @entity3 resort			2
and those who use them say they can be dangerous if care is not taken			2
from @entity18 to @entity19 to @entity20 , people have come together in the sauna - like structures -- typically heated by pouring water on hot lava rocks -- for a variety of reasons , said @entity27 , writer and author of @entity29			1
he 's part @entity30 , a tribe concentrated in the northeast @entity33 , and part @entity34			2
" each tribal nation has its own traditions , so one group might do it differently from another so you can not generalize too much , " said @entity27 , who runs an outdoor education center in @entity37 , @entity38			2
in @entity45 , most native american tribes use the term " sweat lodge " to refer to a dome - shaped structure where the intimate ritual of the sweat takes place , said @entity27 , who has his own sweat lodge on his property in the foothills of the @entity55			1
" sweat lodges are typically used for a ritual preparation , like before a hunt , or nowadays , people might do it before a wedding or dance or some kind of community event as a way of putting yourself in balance , " he said			1
@entity27 noted that incidents like the one in @entity3 tend to raise discussion in @entity71 communities over whether non-natives should be allowed to adapt traditional ceremonies			1
" it 's a very meaningful ceremony			0
i can understand why people find it attractive , " @entity27 said			0
" but i consider it sacrilegious and foolish to do someone else 's rituals without proper guidance or practice , especially in sweat lodges where you 're raising people 's body temperatures			1
with that many people , oxygen is going to be depleted , and if you have heart problems or breathing problems , you could faint or die			0
" no information about the sweatbox at the @entity92 near @entity93 could be found on the web site saturday			0
the two people who died and the 19 others who fell ill there were attending a program by self - help expert @entity100 , authorities said saturday			0
authorities said between 50 and 60 people were in the structure for nearly two hours -- far exceeding the number who ordinarily would participate in a traditional sweat , according to @entity27			1
in a typical ritual , the leader of the sweat gathers four to 12 friends , family members or guests inside the structure , usually made of willow and covered with blankets or canvas , he said			1
" the person running the sweat has to be very aware of the people in the lodge because he takes control of them mentally , physically and spiritually , " said @entity27			1
" the leader is responsible for them , so he has to be aware of their physical conditions and their motivations , their reasons for being there			0
" after everyone is inside , a firekeeper heats stones , usually lava rocks , and brings them into the lodge , placing them in a hole in the ground and carefully pouring water over the stones to release steam			1
the technique of releasing the heat is done with great care so that no one is injured by the steam , which can burn skin or lungs if someone inhales it , said father @entity147 , director of native studies at @entity149			0
" nobody will make it so hot that no one can stand it , " said @entity147			0
" religious leaders are very careful about people 's health in the sweat			2
if they 're not healthy , people can sit outside the sweat and pray and others can go in for them			2
" a ritual of speaking or prayer may follow , depending on the group 's intention for gathering			1
" people talk and often there 's lot of humor , but at any time if it 's too hot , some one can say so and they will immediately open the door and people are encouraged to go out , " he said			0
the @entity176 priest and cultural anthropologist participated in sweats with the @entity180 and @entity181 people for nearly 30 years , until he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis two years ago			0
" it 's not about toughing it out or proving anything			0
it really is a beautiful experience of people coming together , of intense prayerfulness			0
