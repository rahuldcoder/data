@entity0 -- one day after the fourth case of @entity4 was diagnosed in the @entity5 , lawmakers met with administration and public health officials in an already - scheduled congressional hearing to hash out some concerns about the handling of the deadly virus			1
here are four concerns raised in the hearing : 1			0
why hire a lawyer ? ebola czar @entity15 was invited to attend the hearing , but having started the job just this past week , he did not accept the invitation			1
in his absence , a few @entity20 tweaked president @entity22 for choosing @entity15 , a lawyer with managerial experience , over someone with expertise in medicine			1
" why in the world did the president pick a dadgum lawyer ? " rep. @entity30 , @entity32 - @entity31 , asked at the hearing , pointing out that @entity15 does n't have a background in communicable disease , infectious disease , or @entity37			1
" if this were an outbreak of people who do n't have wills in @entity37 , or if this were an outbreak on contested elections in @entity37 , then i 'd say yeah , go hire mr. @entity15 , " @entity30 conintued			1
" but it 's not			0
it 's a medical crisis			0
" @entity20 slams @entity46 pick as @entity4 czar @entity48 , a medical doctor and assistant secretary at the @entity50 , emphasized that the job entails coordinating the multiple agencies that are dealing with the crisis , and a medical background is n't necessary			1
@entity30 then challenged her to take notice if the president ever appoints a doctor to the @entity58 , arguing that it 's unlikely because that person does n't have experience in the law			2
after their exchange , @entity64 rep. @entity63 of @entity65 jokingly chimed in to support the idea of appointing a non-lawyer to the @entity58 , saying it would be " the healthiest damn thing we 've had in the last 50 years			0
longer quarantine time for troops in @entity37 ? by the end of the year , the @entity5 military will have deployed about 3,000 troops to help with humanitarian efforts on the ground in @entity37			2
defense officials at the hearing said soldiers will be held for 10 days at the end of their service , isolated from exposure to @entity4			1
who is the new ebola czar ? if they fall into a low - risk category , they 'll then be transferred to the @entity5 to be monitored for another 21 days			1
but multiple lawmakers at the hearing took issue with bringing the troops back to the @entity5 after only 10 days			2
" is there any reason why we would n't just want to use a 21 - day waiting period in @entity37 before we bring people back to the @entity5 ? " asked rep. @entity94 , a @entity95 from @entity96			2
major gen. @entity102 , deputy director of political - military affairs in @entity37 with the @entity104 , said the 21 - day monitoring period in the @entity5 is a standard procedure recommended by the @entity107			0
and the initial 10 - day period in @entity37 is an extra buffer of time to make sure soldiers are n't exposed to @entity4 before they travel to the @entity5 and start the three - week monitoring			1
timeline of first @entity4 patient in @entity115 facing more pushback from @entity94 and others , the defense officials at the hearing promised to consult with military leaders about extending the 10 - day period in @entity37 to the full 21 days			2
nurses need better materials , training : @entity123 , co-president of @entity124 , spelled out what she believed was a dire need of equipment and better education to protect nurses while treating @entity4 patients			0
according to a survey done by the group of 3,000 nurses at more than 1,000 hospitals in the @entity5 , 85 % of nurses say they have n't been adequately trained			0
gowns and material worn by nurses in @entity140 who treated the first @entity4 patient in the @entity5 still had their necks and wrists exposed , @entity136 said			1
two of them contracted @entity4			0
" this is what happens when guidelines are inefficient and voluntary , " she said , asking that @entity146 pass legislation or the president issue an executive order that mandates the kind of equipment medical professional should wear			0
the @entity107 should have been more careful : the @entity107 initially said that the @entity5 was prepared and ready to prevent the spread of @entity4			1
but after the two nurses came down with the virus , the organization was forced to admit that it made mistakes and began to issue more caution about the virus			0
@entity63 said he was frustrated with how the @entity107 tried to educate the public about the ebola virus , saying you should " never reassure the public when you do n't know			0
" " never do that because when you do that , you damage your credibility , " he said			0
rep. @entity169 , @entity170 , argued @entity5 are tired of hearing officials take extra steps out of " an abundance of caution " after an @entity4 scare			1
" the @entity5 people need to see the abundance of caution beforehand , " rep. @entity169 said			2
@entity48 , the @entity50 official , said , " we see that it is a work in progress and what you 're seeing is we 're taking constant steps to adjust as we learn more			0
