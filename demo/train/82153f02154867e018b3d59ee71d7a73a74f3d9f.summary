-- hospitals in at least eight states want to know how many hundreds or thousands of their patients have come in contact with a lab technician accused of spreading hepatitis c. the man , @entity7 , has the disease , which can pass through contact with contaminated blood , most often via shared needles			1
authorities say the @entity14 native injected himself with painkillers meant for patients when he worked at @entity18 in @entity19 and left the syringes for reuse			2
he was arrested this month in connection with spreading the disease at @entity18 and has been charged with obtaining controlled substances by fraud and tampering with a consumer product , according to an affidavit filed in federal court			1
he is suspected of stealing fentanyl , a powerful analgesic that is substantially more potent than morphine , the affidavit said			0
former hospital worker accused of transmitting hepatitis c thirty @entity18 patients have been diagnosed with the same strain of hepatitis c that @entity7 has			1
now , officials want to be sure that outbreak has not spread past @entity39			0
@entity7 , 33 , worked as a traveling medical technician on a contract basis for hospitals in @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity14 , @entity50 and @entity51 in the past five years , hospitals and health officials in those states confirmed			1
asked wednesday whether anyone in the health care industry ever reported anything about @entity7 , he said : " many health care practitioners view drug diversion as a problem that requires treatment only			1
it does require treatment , but it 's also incumbent on someone to report it to law enforcement authorities			2
this may be a big teaching moment for the industry			0
" authorities in the states where @entity7 worked want patients who may have come in contact with the man to be tested for the disease			1
@entity7 told authorities he found out he had hepatitis c in may 2012 , but further investigation revealed he tested positive for the disease in june 2010			1
@entity77 is considered to be among the most serious of hepatitis viruses			0
it is typically asymptomatic , going undetected until liver damage shows up , according to the @entity82 website			0
@entity19 's health department is asking that anyone who was a patient in @entity18 's operating rooms and the intensive care unit between april 1 , 2011 , and may 25 of this year be tested			2
those are two areas that @entity7 visited during his " routine duties to transport patients , " @entity18 said in a written statement			1
but it added that he " was not involved with procedures or patient care			0
" the hospital said " there is an extremely small chance that anyone will be found to have been infected with a hepatitis c strain that is genetically linked to @entity7 outside of the @entity99			1
" " however , as we continue to learn about @entity7 's history in other states from the ongoing criminal investigation , and out of an abundance of caution , @entity18 supports the ( health department 's ) decision to offer expanded testing to patients treated in these two other areas even though @entity7 had no formal role supporting procedures in those areas			1
" @entity114 said his office interviewed employees at @entity18 who said they had seen @entity7 sweating profusely and with bloodshot eyes			2
" one of them described him as unfit to provide medical care and his supervisor sent him home , " @entity114 said			0
" he provided a plausible explanation for his condition , which was that he had been crying his eyes out because his aunt had died and he was an emotional wreck			0
" according to state and hospital officials , he worked in as a radiology technician and in cardiac catheterization labs in the following locations : -- @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity14 , january to september 2007 ; -- @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity50 , november 2007 to february 2008 ; -- @entity136 , @entity137 , march 2008 to may 2008 ; -- @entity139 @entity138 , may 2008 to november 2008 ; -- @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity49 , december 2008 to february 2009 ; -- @entity142 , @entity139 , july 2009 to january 2010 ; -- @entity143 , @entity139 , january 2010 to march 2010 ; -- @entity144 , @entity145 , april 2010 ; -- @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity48 , may 2010 to september 2010 ; -- @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity47 , october 2010 to march 2011			2
@entity46 health authorities and @entity152 , @entity46 , public health officials have been told the man worked briefly in @entity152 during 2009 and 2010 " for a temporary health care staffing agency			2
" it is not known exactly where he worked			2
" we are in the process of confirming details so that we may accurately inform the public of any potential risk and actions to take , " said @entity158 , director of the @entity152 @entity159 @entity166 is calling in about 200 patients who had a procedure at the lab during the time @entity7 worked there			1
about 460 patients had procedures at the lab in @entity48 during @entity7 's stint there			1
but the number of people who may be tested might change as officials peruse medical records and see who needs to be seen			0
these and the other institutions are calling old patients in and offering free testing			0
the @entity184 is helping state health officers and hospitals tackle the problem			0
like @entity18 and @entity19 , other hospitals and states are , as @entity166 puts it , " erring on the side of patient safety and contacting anyone who came in during that time			2
" " he did n't necessarily have contact with all patients who were at the lab during that time period , " said a statement from @entity166			0
@entity48 @entity199 and @entity200 and @entity202 officer @entity201 said he understands patient concerns but is reassuring people that " we have no reason to be concerned about additional risks to the public " because @entity7 worked in @entity48 two years ago			1
authorities across the @entity209 want to know as much as they can about @entity7 's whereabouts since he became infected			1
the @entity50 health department asked the state 's hospitals and radiology facilities to identify any place where @entity7 might have worked since january 1 , 2007 , either as a facility employee or as a " traveler " employed by a contracting agency			1
@entity7 was arrested earlier this month in a @entity220 hospital where he was being treated			2
he is now being held in the @entity222 , @entity19 , jail			0
he could face more than 20 years in prison if convicted			0
" the evidence gathered to date points irrefutably to @entity7 as the source of the hepatitis c outbreak at @entity18			2
with his arrest , we have eliminated the menace this ' serial infector ' posed to public health and safety , " @entity209 attorney @entity114 in @entity19 said			1
@entity7 appeared in @entity19 federal court tuesday and waived his right to a detention hearing			1
@entity114 said it is possible more charges could be filed			0
a negligence complaint and a class action lawsuit have been filed in @entity241 in @entity242 , @entity243 , against @entity244 , a health care company that hired and placed @entity7 at @entity18			1
one of the cases , filed by @entity247 , @entity19 , resident @entity248 claimed @entity7 was negligently hired and retained			1
" @entity249 failed to exercise reasonable care in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the job mr. @entity7 was to perform at @entity18			2
triage failed to exercise the degree of care required related to the severity of risk to mr. @entity248			0
@entity249 knew or should have known of mr. @entity7 's likelihood of causing harm to mr. @entity248 when it supervised mr. @entity7			1
triage failed to conduct a reasonable investigation that could have found mr. @entity7 's likelihood of causing harm to mr. @entity248 , " the suit said			1
@entity264 , a spokesman for @entity244 , told @entity0 in an e-mail that " we are aware of issues involving a former contract medical technologist at @entity18			0
given that there is an ongoing criminal investigation , as well as pending civil litigation , it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time			0
" @entity248 's attorney , @entity273 of @entity274 , said firms like @entity249 need to perform due diligence in vetting employees			0
at present , he said , a cashier at a hardware store gets " more scrutiny " for hiring than people working in important health care jobs			0
firms that employ traveling health care workers need to rethink their hiring procedures , he said , and " hospital policies and procedures need to be changed as well			0
" spate of hepatitis c cases linked to @entity19 hospital @entity0 's @entity291 and @entity292 contributed to this report .			0

staffing firm says it 's aware of the issue but has no immediate comment
the suspect worked in several states as a lab technician
