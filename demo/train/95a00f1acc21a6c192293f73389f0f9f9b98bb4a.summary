" if you lie to me , i hurt you , " @entity5 says to the prisoner , who is bound , bruised , and not telling the @entity8 what they need to know			0
soon , the prisoner will be held down on the floor with a cloth over his face and will have water poured into his mouth until he is half - drowned			2
this is waterboarding , and it leaves the prisoner gasping like a dying fish			0
but he does not give up his secrets , and will not until later in the game			0
we can imagine this scene played out in different ways			0
imagine it , for example , with @entity27 heavies playing the interrogators and @entity29 as the prisoner			0
or we could see it with @entity32 demanding answers in " 24			0
" scenes of torture are not rare in tv and movies , and it 's not like the old days when the hero was always on the receiving end			2
yet even before " @entity42 " opened , these scenes have stirred controversy , with outspoken critiques accusing director @entity45 ( " the @entity46 " ) of endorsing torture			1
and although controversy is nothing new to the director of " @entity52 " and " @entity53 , " these complaints seem off base			2
@entity45 has never shied away from violence or the vicarious pleasure of sadism , but that 's not the same thing as condoning it			1
look at how she filters the torture scenes through @entity3 's reactions : @entity3 is clearly out of place and uncomfortable with what she must witness , though she will also participate in it			2
@entity65 : did torture really net bin @entity66 ? the movie -- which is utterly gripping -- is an authoritative , precise , largely dispassionate account of how a @entity72 analyst in @entity73 worked for a decade tracking down @entity66			1
that work involved torture in the years immediately following 9/11 , as a matter of historical record			0
@entity45 throws us in at the deep end , and rightly so			1
the scenes are painful to watch ( but also impossible not to ) , and the intelligence gleaned is at best partial			0
whether partial intelligence is better than none is an open question , but it 's also evident in " @entity42 " that it was n't torture that eventually led us to @entity66 , but clear thinking , sophisticated surveillance and the determination and resources to follow every lead			1
@entity45 has rarely focused on women as active protagonists ( " @entity94 " is the most notable exception ) , but it is significant that @entity3 is a woman in a predominantly masculine world , compelled to renounce her sexuality to get the job done			1
@entity3 's resolve , smarts and conviction that borders on obsessive make her a fascinating and impressive character , and @entity103 delivers one of the must - see performances of the year			1
@entity106 : a feminist film epic and the real women of the @entity72 @entity45 keeps the focus on process -- in a way it 's like a police procedural or a detective story , but played out in foreign lands and interspersed with eruptions of violence and bomb blasts			1
the climax -- the @entity121 raid -- is nail - biting stuff , even though we know the outcome , with exceptionally vivid nighttime photography by @entity126			0
what 's striking is the absence of triumphalism -- @entity45 does n't shy away from showing the victims shot down in cold blood in the compound -- and we come away with the overwhelming sense that this has been a grim , dark episode in our history , a rite of passage almost , but a passage into an unknowable future , leaving scars that may never heal .			2
