-- @entity2 ' @entity1 is a 32 - year - old @entity4 blogger , government critic , and a father of two young children			2
he has not been seen since a february 18 gathering near @entity9			2
@entity10 said in a briefing paper issued tuesday that @entity12 is one of many people who have vanished in what they say is a " campaign of enforced disappearances " -- a practice by @entity19 forces trying to squelch the opposition movement			1
the paper -- titled " @entity4 : detainees , @entity30 and @entity31 " -- explores more than 30 cases of people who have disappeared since protests started in the war - torn @entity27 nation			1
among those missing are political activists and " those suspected of being rebel fighters or supporters of fighters			2
" " it appears that there is a systematic policy to detain anyone suspected of opposition to @entity45 's rule , hold them incommunicado , and transfer them to his strongholds in western @entity4 , " said @entity38 , @entity10 's director for the @entity39 and @entity27			1
" given the circumstances of their enforced disappearance there is every reason to believe that these individuals are at serious risk of torture and ill - treatment			2
" @entity38 called on @entity19 to " halt this outrageous campaign and order his forces to abide by international law			2
" @entity10 says the documented cases " are believed to represent only a small proportion of the total number of people who have been detained or have disappeared " recently in @entity19 's custody			1
recent video indicates the extent of the problem			0
it shows prisoners roughed up and taunted by @entity19 forces			0
some of them say there were demonstrators and others deny it			0
" the true number is impossible to establish , as the authorities in @entity80 generally do not divulge information about detainees they are holding and because many areas of the country are not accessible for independent reporting			0
some relatives of detainees are also unwilling to publicize their names for fear of possible reprisals , " @entity10 said			1
@entity4 officials did not immediately respond to efforts to obtain a response to the @entity10 report			1
the cases include " three broad categories , " the report says : -- government critics , pro-democracy activists , writers and others detained in the days before the february 17 " peaceful demonstrations " across @entity4			1
" they appear to have been arrested by the authorities as a pre-emptive strike in an effort to nip the protests in the bud following the public protests that had caused the downfall of longstanding repressive governments in @entity111 and @entity112 , two of @entity4 's neighbors			0
" -- anti-government protestors and youths who went missing on february 20 , when the @entity117 , a @entity118 special forces unit , was forced to evacuate from a military compound in @entity9 after violent clashes with protesters			0
" @entity10 has documented the cases of nine men and boys who have not been seen since they went to the @entity126 compound area on evening of 20 february 2011 , including four teenagers under 18			1
" -- people captured in or near @entity129 , where there had been " intermittent fighting			0
" " @entity10 has obtained information about a number of individuals who went missing in the area between @entity137 and @entity129 , west of @entity9			1
some are believed to have been fighters , others to be civilians who went to the area in order to assist the wounded , and still others people who may have been onlookers			0
" @entity10 said foreign journalists who had been detained and released " have reported that they were beaten and assaulted and threatened with execution , in some cases even being subjected to mock execution , and have expressed concern about @entity4 who they saw being mistreated in detention			1
" it said there are fears too that some detainees may be held " as bargaining chips or to put pressure on their relatives and friends to deter them from joining the opposition			0
" the agency said its concerns " are heightened by the long pattern of gross and widespread human rights violations " that have marked @entity19 's rule			0
" these include enforced disappearances , extrajudicial executions , prolonged arbitrary detention , torture and other ill - treatment , as well as severe restrictions on freedom of expression and the rights to freedom of assembly and association			2
" @entity10 is urging the government to release peaceful protesters , ensure than any alleged captured fighters be treated humanely and given access to the @entity183 , and grant " unhindered access " to humanitarian groups			1
as for @entity188 , his family fears for his safety			0
one relative told @entity10 that " he has simply disappeared , " and speculates he was taken to areas under the control of @entity118 forces			1
" we kept trying to call his phone but never got through , until some days later when a man who spoke with a western ( western @entity4 ) accent answered and said : ' this is what happens to those who throw stones at us '			0
but @entity2 had never even thrown stones , " the relative said .			0

@entity10 looks at more than 30 disappearances
it appears to be a " systematic policy , " it says
there likely are many more *unreported* cases , the organization says
