-- practically from the day the @entity2 started on october 4 , 1957 , when the @entity3 launched the first human - made satellite into @entity7 orbit , it 's been like this			2
every time there 's a conspicuous breakthrough in space , somebody , somewhere will find a way to kill the buzz			2
after @entity19 's touchdown on the comet wednesday , this hashtag # @entity16 ( as in # @entity16 find a missing plane on our own planet ) started trending in the @entity24			1
and @entity25 are especially good at this grousing			1
people have been shouting " oh , wow ! " and then " oh no ! " since the 1950s			2
@entity25 on the one hand were alarmed that their @entity30 nemesis had rockets big enough to hurl heavy metal projectiles at us and on the other were camping outside at night to see the little beeping ball fly over their backyards			1
@entity25 ' consensus love - hate for space exploration has assumed many forms over the years			1
once the nation got over its collective shock - and - awe of @entity44 , its citizenry demanded that its scientists and politicians figure out a way to get our own projectiles up there asap			1
we did it , with some notable disasters on the way , at which time the moaning over whether we should spend so much taxpayer money on such risky endeavors would begin			2
we were taken back to those dismal days in recent weeks when a rocket launched by the privately owned ( but government contracted ) @entity59 with cargo for the @entity61 exploded in midair shortly after lifting off from @entity63 , @entity64			0
three days later , @entity65 , built by @entity66 ( private , not taxpayer , dollars in this case ) as a working prototype for a passenger spacecraft , broke up during a flight test over @entity73 's @entity72 and crashed , killing its co-pilot and seriously injuring its pilot			0
both these catastrophes were too reminiscent of the serial test failures of the 1950s in which rockets regularly blew up before reaching the stratosphere and test pilots seeking faster , higher records in the same @entity72 skies lost their planes and their lives			0
it was through such trial and error that , eventually , @entity25 got proficient enough to send satellites and people into space and succeed much more often than it did n't			1
and we fell in love			0
the romance of space flight became part of our national identity , especially after we started sending humans of our own			2
as we exceeded our planetary boundaries by sending probes , and then men to the moon , other boundaries seemed less daunting and forbidding			0
and yet , with many cheering and goading the country to fly higher , farther and faster , there were just as many @entity25 wondering if too many of our resources were being squandered for what was mostly a speculative endeavor			1
my own cheerleading for space travel was often countered with some spoilsport , honest and sincere , complaining that all that money being shot into the skies could be put to better use on @entity7 : e.g. why do we need to go to @entity120 when we have all these problems on @entity7 to solve ? for a long time , i had no strong counterargument			1
but now , with the space shuttle program literally mounted in museums and no government plans to return to the moon or head for @entity120 any time soon , i find myself asking how that solving - problems - on - @entity7 thing is going now			1
i 'm still waiting for a sensible answer , but i do n't think one exists			2
the urge to explore and push ourselves out into the universe is not mutually exclusive from the effort to improve our own minds and environment			0
consider : last year , 7 million people visited the @entity139 in @entity140 , beating out @entity142 's @entity141 by roughly a million			0
many of them look at vintage spacecraft and archival mockups and openly wonder where our yearning for adventure has gone since the turn of this century			0
even the movies bring this up			0
" we used to be explorers and pioneers , " says a character in the just - released science fiction spectacular , " @entity155			1
" " now we 're a generation of caretakers			0
" @entity161 's film conceives a potential future in which what 's left of @entity164 has gone underground to figure out options for humankind literally choking to death on ecological decay on @entity7			0
in this future , it seems as though the moon - landing - denial constituency has gained such a foothold in the public schools that a student can get in trouble for suggesting we did in fact land on the moon			1
ca n't we all just be happy that human beings can do what the @entity180 did this week ? probably not			0
i 'm just waiting for some troll to claim that it is n't a real breakthrough unless @entity25 do it first .			1

@entity187 : @entity19 landing amazing , but people still grouse about whether *expense* worth it
@entity25 loved - hated space travel since *challenge* of @entity44 . they want in , but leery of cost
he says pioneering is in @entity25 *dna* ; *earthbound* endeavors should n't preclude space ones
@entity203 : " @entity155 " notes change from explorers to " caretakers "
