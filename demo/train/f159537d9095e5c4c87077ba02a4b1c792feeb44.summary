@entity6 for a group with the chief purpose of helping to get @entity4 women elected into higher office , @entity0 enters 2016 closer to the top prize -- the presidency -- than ever before , and with fewer restrictions than what faced political organization the last time @entity14 ran			1
senior operatives at the @entity4 operation are pledging that 2016 will be @entity0 's most active election to date , one where they hope the group 's deep connections to @entity21 -- the expected favorite for the @entity4 nomination -- will magnify their efforts			1
@entity0 was very active in the race in 2008 during @entity21 's first bid , but election laws have changed vastly since then -- mostly thanks to the @entity30 's @entity29 decision in 2010 -- making it possible for the group to play a bigger role			1
the former secretary of state herself will headline the group 's 30th anniversary gala in @entity6 , @entity6 next week , a nod to their importance to both the former first lady and to @entity4 2016 scene			0
@entity41 , the political director at @entity0 has been tapped to lead the group 's independent expenditure effort in 2016 , expected to outpace their most expensive cycle to date -- $ 14 million last year			1
the group , which raised more than $ 60 million for @entity4 women in 2014 , expects that with @entity21 atop the ticket -- and energy among other women candidates to run -- they will easily break through those fundraising numbers			1
" we are going to play a bigger role than we have ever played , " @entity41 said about the group			1
" there is going to be a level of excitement for our @entity0 community and from women and men around the country to elect the first women president and , more importantly , to elect the right person			2
" @entity60 , the president of @entity0 , has left the @entity62 board so that she can work closer with the @entity21 campaign and still comply with election coordination rules			1
@entity41 will take @entity60 's seat on the super @entity67 board , a body that has long been seen as the center of the @entity71 world , where leaders from the different organizations can meet and coordinate efforts to help boost @entity21 's campaign efforts			0
the group 's will not be just about boosting @entity14 and female @entity4			0
as it has been in the past , @entity0 's 2016 plan will also focus on trying to define @entity79 candidates as bad for women across the country			2
some of these efforts have already started			0
earlier this month , @entity0 launched " @entity79 2016 : @entity83 , " an interactive graphic that will " chronicle @entity79 ' out of touch agenda for @entity87 women			2
" this kind of messaging is common for @entity0 , but with @entity21 atop the ticket , advisers for the group expect the contrasts to be more defined			2
the focus is on ensuring that the gender gap for a likely @entity21 campaign is as big -- if not bigger -- than the 12 - point margin that @entity98 enjoyed in 2012			2
" that is our niche , that is our role , and that is what we are going to do here , " @entity41 said , stressing that the group will be targeted and strategic about their investments			0
that will be critical , because spending in the 2016 election is expected to break all previous records			0
sources have told @entity7 that priorities , the @entity67 going into the next election cycle , hopes to raise $ 300 - $ 500 million for 2016 , while the @entity113 brothers , uber - @entity79 donors and businessman , have said they will spend $ 898 million during the election			1
@entity0 's pockets are considerably smaller , but @entity41 and others said their money will be more focused than scattershot			0
" i am not going to say what we are going to do and what we are not , but we , as a progressive community , have got to be more targeted and smarter , " @entity41 said			0
" we are going to figure out what that is			0

@entity0 , energized with the prospect of electing the first woman president , is preparing to go big in 2016
the group plans to make the election cycle their most expensive to date -- spending over $ 14 million
" we are going to play a bigger role than we have ever played , " said the operative *tasked* with leading the effort
