@entity0 , @entity1 -- of the 84,000 chemicals on the market today -- many of which are in objects that people come into contact with every day -- only about 1 percent of them have been studied for safety , sen. @entity3 said tuesday			1
@entity3 , @entity12 , told a hearing of the @entity14 that such little oversight means that children in the @entity17 are virtual " guinea pigs in an uncontrolled experiment			1
" " our current law does not allow @entity27 [ @entity27 ] scientists to draw the bright line between chemicals that are safe and those that are toxic , " the senator said in the hearing , which was held at the @entity22 in his home state			1
@entity3 has introduced legislation that would require chemical manufacturers to prove the safety of their products before they 're released into the market			1
he said the current law -- the @entity39 -- is too lax , resulting in the banning of five chemicals in the past 34 years			2
a toxic history lesson the subcommittee is examining how chemicals that @entity17 are exposed to in daily life might be harming the health of children , including those developing in the womb , after a growing number of studies are finding hundreds of toxic chemicals in the bodies of mothers , and subsequently , in their babies after birth			2
@entity27 administrator @entity57 called the issue one of her main priorities			1
" everything from our cars to the cell phones we all have in our pockets are made with chemicals , " @entity60 said at the hearing			1
" a child born in @entity17 today will grow up exposed to more chemicals than any other generation in our history			2
" manufacturers often cite confidentiality laws in refusing to reveal safety data , @entity60 said , and they say new regulations would infringe on profitability			2
she noted that the @entity17 is far behind other countries , especially in @entity80 , that have already banned several substances			0
dr. @entity82 , @entity2 's chief medical correspondent , also addressed the hearing , relaying what he learned as he researched a @entity2 special called " @entity86			1
" @entity82 said he was surprised to find out that only about 200 chemicals in use today have undergone testing required by the @entity27			1
" i 'd always assumed government watchdogs had evaluated and signed off on the safety of the chemicals we encounter in our lives , " he said			0
@entity82 said , " what we do n't know can really hurt us			1
and there 's a lot we do n't know			1
" @entity82 : chemicals around us -- we must know more @entity2 's " @entity86 " special , first broadcast in june , focused on the impact of exposure to chemicals in daily life			1
the first hour was " @entity110 , " which looked at a once - rural town in @entity112 now surrounded by chemical plants , and the second hour was " @entity106 , " which examined chemicals in everyday life and their possible health effects			0
while there is no science that demonstrates a conclusive cause - and - effect relationship between chemicals children are born with and particular health problems , studies are finding associations between elevated levels of chemicals in a baby 's body and their development			1
" babies in this country are born ' pre-polluted , ' " @entity82 said			1
other witnesses in tuesday 's hearing were @entity130 , a @entity1 mother of a child with autism and an immune system disorder ; dr. @entity134 , executive and medical director of the @entity137 ; and dr. @entity138 , director of the @entity139			1
@entity138 's center has been following hundreds of pregnant women over the past 12 years to measure chemicals entering the womb during pregnancy			2
the women trudge through @entity146 for 48 hours wearing special backpacks , each with a long tube that is slung over the shoulder			2
the tube , resting inches below the pregnant mom 's mouth , sucks air into a special filter , giving an approximate measurement of the air that she is breathing			1
the backpack is designed to measure ambient toxics spewed by vehicles and pesticides , along with chemicals from common household products			0
" it surprised me when we analyzed the air samples [ from the backpacks ] and found 100 percent of them had detectable levels of at least one pesticide and the air pollutants we were interested in , " @entity138 , who also is a professor at the @entity165 , told @entity2 earlier this year			1
" @entity173 taught world to get the lead out so far , the toxics measured in the backpacks match what scientists are finding in the cord blood of the babies once they are born			0
small studies by other groups also are finding common household chemicals in babies			0
" we 've measured hundreds and hundreds of toxic chemicals in the blood of babies that are still in the womb , " said @entity186 , president of the @entity187 , a nonprofit environmental advocacy organization			0
" flame retardants , the chemicals in consumer products like personal care products , makeup , shampoos			0
it 's a very long list			2
" the organization 's study found an average of 232 chemicals in the cord blood of 10 babies born in late 2009			2
they are chemicals found in a wide array of common household products , including shampoos and conditioners , cosmetics , plastics , shower curtains , mattresses and electronics such as computers and cell phones			0
@entity138 and her colleagues are following the children in their study from the uterus , through birth , and up to their first several years of life			0
they recently published a study in the journal pediatrics demonstrating an association between the chemicals they found in babies ' cord blood and later problems on intelligence tests and development			0
" fifteen percent of children [ in our study ] have at least one developmental problem , " @entity138 said			0
the amount of chemicals measured in the cord blood of the babies seems to matter			0
the higher the concentration , the more the iq among children seems to dip			0
the study is also being conducted among pregnant women in @entity246 and @entity247 , and finding similar results			0
@entity250 producer @entity249 contributed to this report .			0
