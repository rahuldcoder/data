-- a few weeks into the fall tv season , and already one show is down for the count			0
the cast from " quarterlife " played young , artsy 20 - somethings on the incredibly short - lived show			2
but let 's look on the bright side			0
" @entity16 " got at least two episodes in before the @entity11 gave it the ax , spared from that tv - land rarity : the single episode show			1
although the jury 's still out on which series will last to see this year 's november sweeps , none of them ( as their developers are certainly thankful about ) can be lumped in with the truly cringe - worthy and sadly uninteresting one - episode wonders			1
here are some of the shows that saw the light of your television screen for just a single episode			1
known as the show that started the idea of the quick hook , @entity32 's 1961 live celebrity game show " you 're in the picture " was hosted by @entity38			1
the grand idea was to invite celebrities on and ask them to stick their heads into a painted scene and guess which one it is			0
it was so dismal , @entity38 spent a half - hour the following week apologizing for letting the show air , and it was then replaced with " the @entity47			1
there were a few shows pushing buttons in the tumultuous time of the 1960s , but the producers of the late - ' 60s sketch comedy show " @entity54 " thought the envelope had n't been pushed quite enough			1
" @entity61 , " a similar comedy show , hit @entity58 's airwaves in february 1969 and was so controversial , it was turned off after just one episode			1
networks have capitalized on popular movie trends for decades ( looking at you , " @entity66 " ) , and 1979 's " @entity67 " was no different			0
attempting to ride the popularity of " @entity70 , " this half - hour show asked the question , " what happens when all - female @entity73 goes co-ed ? " answer ? @entity32 cancels it			1
@entity75 are finicky about their cop shows , as @entity77 , the man who brought us " @entity79 " and " @entity80 , " knows all too well			0
some of them spark enough spinoffs to keep a show alive throughout generations , and others , like 1996 's " public morals , " a sitcom about the humorous antics of the @entity79 , just spark hate			2
one - hit wonders : 3 ; @entity32 : 0			1
in 1997 , @entity91 unveiled " @entity92 , " an action series featuring @entity95 star @entity94 as a detective			0
after the pilot episode , " @entity92 " was outlawed , although @entity94 did go on to act again			0
right in the middle of the dot - com bubble , @entity58 tried to stake its claim with " @entity101 " in 2000 , a sort of online version of " @entity104			0
" " @entity101 " was also like a premonition for the internet bubble that was about to burst : it went belly - up after the pilot			0
not to be confused with a " @entity111 " episode , 2005 's " @entity121 " was a @entity91 reality series - turned - reality " special " about a woman who was adopted at birth , trying to pick out her birth father from a set of eight men , with $ 100,000 riding on the line			1
needless to say , that gem of a concept angered viewers and adoption advocates alike			0
it 's true that there is n't much reality television fans wo n't watch , but @entity32 's 2005 series " @entity131 " was one of them			1
it featured a cast of 10 fame - seekers all angling to get in a wealthy 73 - year - old man 's will			2
the show died before the money - grubbers could craft a eulogy			2
@entity141 may be known for a few things , but pulling off a " @entity143 " - esque series is n't one of them			2
" @entity154 , " 2006 's show about a book publishing career woman with the requisite gay guy sidekick , was just no replacement for @entity153 's @entity152 - ed foursome			1
that does n't mean @entity58 stopped trying , though : " @entity160 " rolled out in 2008 , only to meet a similar fate as @entity158 's bomb of a sitcom			0
next on the " so bad it should n't have aired " reality show train is " anchorwoman , " a 2007 show about model @entity164 becoming an anchor for a small - town @entity167 station			1
if you do n't remember it , it 's because you were among the millions and millions of viewers @entity91 was hoping would tune in , and did n't			0
who knows what did in @entity32 's 2008 " @entity175			1
" maybe it was the thought of watching not one but two boxers perform musical acts ? ( @entity180 was slated to sing @entity181 , and @entity182 would have wooed the audience with his rapping			0
) we watch them dance awkwardly and duke it out in isolated jungles but , apparently , we do n't care what " secret talents " celebrities are holding close to the vest			0
as if being 25 is n't depressing enough			0
" @entity198 , " @entity194 's 2008 attempt to take a web - based show and turn it into a small - screen drama , failed miserably despite its online popularity			2
the show , focused on a group of 20 - somethings trying to make their way through life and the digital age , earned some of the worst ratings @entity194 had seen in years			2
the rest of the season 's episodes were exiled to @entity210 .			2

the @entity11 canceled " @entity16 " last week after just two episodes
still , that places the series ahead of some of television 's one - hit wonders
the list starts in with @entity32 's 1961 show " you 're in the picture "
reality shows and *scripted* series alike have received the " one episode and out " boot
