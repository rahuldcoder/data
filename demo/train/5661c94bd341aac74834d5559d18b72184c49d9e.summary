for 67 years , the @entity0 has been a peaceful refuge for @entity2 , much like the @entity4 province village of @entity5 where it rests and where he has lived all those years			0
but , as he swept its floors on thursday , it was painfully obvious things had changed			0
the night before , a mob -- chanting against @entity13 such as @entity2 and calling for @entity14 to become an " islamic state " -- had torched and looted the @entity0			2
" i did n't expect this to happen , " @entity2 said			0
@entity17 all around @entity14 are cleaning up in the aftermath of a spate of attacks , which came on the country 's deadliest day since the 2011 revolution that overthrew longtime president @entity23			1
@entity24 , the @entity25 - born head of the @entity26 in the @entity27 , said he was told by colleagues in @entity14 that 52 churches were attacked in a 24 - hour span that started wednesday , as well as numerous @entity17 ' homes and businesses			1
@entity33 , a researcher with the @entity34 , told @entity35 he had confirmed attacks on at least 30 churches so far , in addition to the targeting of church - related facilities , including schools and cultural centers			1
those churches reportedly set ablaze wednesday included @entity44 in @entity45 , a city south of @entity25 on the @entity47			1
and the new day brought new attacks			2
prince @entity49 in @entity51 , which is southwest of @entity25 , was stormed and burned thursday night , according to the official @entity52			1
this and other attacks have been blamed by some on supporters of the @entity57 , the @entity58 movement which backs recently deposed president @entity59			2
government efforts to clear the group 's @entity25 protest camps resulted in gruesome scenes in the capital : @entity14 's health ministry says that at least 580 people were killed and more than 4,000 injured amid clashes involving security forces and @entity59 supporters			1
against this backdrop , it may be some time before it 's established what group , if any , is behind the church attacks , and how coordinated this violence has been			1
until then , @entity17 in @entity14 are left to try to put things back together , as well as to attempt to make sense of what 's transpired			1
as @entity78 of the @entity79 , told @entity35 : " this is horrible to happen in only one day			0
" ' a very dangerous game to play ' @entity14 will have much to deal with if , and when , things do settle down			0
once that happens , @entity24 says that a proper investigation of the church attacks should follow -- especially since , he feels , the sheer scale of incidents suggests they were orchestrated , rather than a byproduct of chaotic unrest			1
" we would want the people who have done it to be brought to justice because i think they are trying to do something which is much more dangerous , " he said			0
" it 's not just about burning churches , it 's about burning churches to initiate a response that then spirals into even greater violence -- and that is a very , very dangerous game to play			1
" the targeting of churches and @entity17 properties was not unexpected , @entity24 said , given the tensions in @entity25 and elsewhere and in light of escalating attacks on @entity13 in recent weeks			1
the growing threat led him last week to issue a statement warning of " a very real risk upon the life of every @entity17			0
" pope @entity112 , the church 's leader in @entity14 , also suspended weekly public events for fear of attacks on @entity17 congregations			1
but the warnings did n't prevent the violence , nor did security efforts to protect churches and @entity17 communities , according to @entity33			1
said @entity24 , " the ferocity and the speed with which it all happened ... was quite surprising			1
" burning of books a @entity127 of @entity14 statement posted online wednesday reported the " complete burning and destruction " of its bookshops in the cities of @entity133 and @entity134 , in southern @entity14			2
" fortunately we were closed today , fearing such an attack , so none of our staff were injured , " wrote @entity135 , the society 's general director			1
" the attackers demolished the metal doors protecting the bookshops , broke the store windows behind them and set the bookshops on fire			2
" other stores and parked cars on those streets were also destroyed , he said			0
" it is important to underline that -- while some @entity17 properties have been the victim of this violence -- they are by no means the only ones targeted , " @entity135 said			2
" this is an attack against the state by a violent minority in an attempt to destabilize the nation			0
" @entity35 ireporter @entity161 , from @entity25 , helped draw up a list of christian churches and properties reportedly targeted			1
on it are sites in @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity133 , @entity170 , @entity25 , @entity51 , @entity171 , @entity4 , @entity134 , @entity172 , @entity45 and @entity173			2
they include churches and schools , as well as homes and businesses belonging to @entity13			0
@entity35 has not been able independently to verify the reports			0
asked about the attacks on churches wednesday , @entity181 spokeswoman @entity180 said the @entity184 was deeply concerned			2
" we will continue speaking out against this and continue talking to all parties and all sides about renouncing this violence , about moving forward with a democratic process			0
" @entity191 , director of communications at @entity192 , said the group was " deeply concerned at the unwarranted and continuing targeting of the @entity13 community			0
we urge the government to ensure comprehensive security to all @entity14 , regardless of their religion			0
" @entity200 history in @entity14 @entity14 's @entity17 minority has been the target of a number of attacks in recent years			2
the bombing of a major church in @entity168 in january 2011 killed 21 people and sparked worldwide condemnation			0
the situation has only become worse since @entity14 's popular revolution overthrew former president @entity23 in 2011 , said @entity24			1
" in the past two - and - a - half years , we 've had more deaths of people just because they are @entity17 than in the last 20 years , " he said , adding that this had not triggered violent retaliation			0
he hopes for forgiveness and reconciliation among all @entity14 going forward , to help build a unified country			0
@entity17 have been in @entity14 since the 1st century and were , for centuries , the majority			0
some 90 % of @entity13 still live in the country , he said , making up the largest @entity17 community in the @entity222			0
@entity24 puts the proportion of @entity17 in @entity14 at 15 to 20 % of the population			2
the @entity225 says 10 % of @entity14 's population is @entity17 , while the @entity227 , which says firm numbers are hard to come by , puts the figure at about 5 %			0
back in @entity5 , @entity230 told @entity35 his family 's houses were attacked on the same night the church was looted			1
there was incitement against the @entity13 community through the mosques in the area , he said			0
father @entity239 , of @entity5 's @entity0 , said he believes that a small group of extremists were responsible for inciting groups to attack his church			2
but , he and other church staff said , not everyone participated , and some non-christians prevented the situation in that village from getting worse			1
they credited moderate @entity249 with putting out the fire at @entity251 , and halting further attacks on @entity13 ' homes and shops .			1

a christian church southwest of @entity25 is attacked , state news says
moderate @entity249 put out fire at one church , halted other attacks , church staff say
a @entity26 leader says 52 churches have been attacked in 24 hours
@entity24 : " it 's about burning churches to initiate a response that spirals into greater violence "
