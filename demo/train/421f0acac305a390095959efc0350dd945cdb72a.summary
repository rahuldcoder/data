-- @entity2 is reducing the price of the @entity5 game console , hoping to help the 5 - year - old system reach a larger audience , the company said on tuesday			1
the base model now costs $ 250 , and another system with twice the storage space is $ 300			1
@entity2 cut $ 50 from each , which is nearly the price of a new game			1
" while others in the space are losing steam , @entity5 is gaining momentum , " @entity14 , the president and ceo of @entity16 , said in a statement			0
" the new price will make the @entity5 more accessible than ever before			0
" @entity2 last cut prices on the @entity5 in 2009 , when it released a slimmer model			2
@entity25 has not reduced the @entity27 's price since 2009 , and analysts are split on whether it will do so this year as a response to @entity2			2
the entry - level @entity27 costs $ 200			0
@entity2 's move is seen by analysts as a usual part of a game system 's life cycle			1
game console generations typically last four to six years , but some predict that motion - detection peripherals like @entity25 's @entity40 for the @entity27 and @entity2 's @entity41 could prolong the current cycle			1
@entity42 announced last month that the successor to the @entity44 , a tablet - controlled device called the @entity45 , will hit the market next year			1
the news comes as the @entity44 , this generation 's top - selling console , is experiencing a sales slump			0
@entity42 reduced the price of the @entity44 from $ 200 to $ 150 in may			2
last month , @entity42 cut the price of the @entity52 , its handheld game console that displays 3 - d graphics without needing special glasses			1
the @entity52 now costs $ 170 , a 40 % reduction for a console that 's less than five months old			0
sales of the @entity52 tumbled quickly after a promising launch , and analysts have attributed the proliferation of inexpensive , quick - hit games for @entity62 and smartphones as a hindrance to growth in the market for hand - held game systems			0
@entity2 is gearing up for the release of the @entity69 , a portable game console that follows the @entity70			1
to compete with smartphones , it will have downloadable games , a touchscreen and @entity75 data connectivity			0
the version with @entity75 will cost $ 300 , and the one without will cost $ 250			2
@entity2 is still recovering from a nearly monthlong outage that affected its online game networks			0
the cyberattack , which resulted in stolen personal and financial information , did not seem to harm sales of the console , according to reports			0
@entity2 , which has sold more than 50 million @entity5 systems , compensated customers with free game downloads .			2

@entity2 cut the @entity5 to a base price of $ 250
analysts see the move as a *normal* part of a game console 's life cycle
@entity42 has already announced its next home game console , called the @entity45
