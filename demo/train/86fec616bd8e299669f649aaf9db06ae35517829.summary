-- @entity1 may not have a word to say , but the large rodent - shaped balloon helped a labor union earn a free - speech victory thursday before @entity8 's highest court			1
@entity9 , based in @entity10 , @entity11 , rents out " union rats " like @entity13 and other inflatables			1
the seven justices ruled unanimously that the local union had a right to display its 10 - foot - tall , black , rat - shaped balloon at a rally held outside a fitness center			1
at issue was whether a township could enforce a ban on inflatable or portable signs and banners on public property			0
@entity28 police had levied a $ 100 fine against an official from the @entity31 because of @entity13			2
the court concluded that while townships have a right to maintain an " aesthetic environment " and ensure public safety , its restrictions on expressive displays " do not justify a content - based restriction of non-commercial speech			1
" " there is no evidence to suggest that a rat balloon is significantly more harmful to aesthetics or safety than a similar item being displayed as an advertisement or commercial logo , " wrote justice @entity41 the balloon and others like it , nicknamed @entity13 by the @entity10 - based company that made them , have been used by labor unions as street theater since 1990 to protest anti-union activities			1
@entity31 members were marching on the sidewalk outside @entity60 in @entity28 in april 2005 in response to a dispute with a contractor working at the business			2
a police officer had ordered the balloon deflated , but returned an hour later to find it blown back up			0
the labor official in charge admitted he ordered the rat reinflated , and he was given a summons			0
lower state courts had ruled the township 's ordinance was content - neutral and did not suppress the union 's ability to spread its message , since members still could chant and distribute handbills to the public			0
about 200 @entity13 balloons are used by labor unions nationwide , according to @entity9			0
they come in three colors , each showing pink eyes , front claws extended , and two big front incisors .			0

court : towns have right to enforce aesthetics , but not curb speech
@entity1 balloon displayed at union rallies in @entity8
@entity28 banned display of inflatables , including 10 - foot rat balloon
