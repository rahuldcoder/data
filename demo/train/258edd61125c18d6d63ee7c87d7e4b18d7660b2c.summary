-- there 's one thing @entity6 @entity5 @entity4 candidate @entity3 and his @entity8 opponent @entity7 have in common : they 're both finished talking about " @entity10			1
" @entity7 's controversial attack ad paralyzed both campaigns this week			1
the spot accuses @entity3 of once belonging to a group that mocked religion in his college days at @entity18			1
the ad features a claim from an anonymous woman who told the @entity22 and @entity23 that @entity3 's group forced her to pray to a false idol named @entity10			1
at a news conference at the @entity28 and @entity29 factory outside of @entity30 , @entity6 , @entity3 signed a pledge to repeal the estate tax , dubbed the " death tax " by conservatives			2

in a brief interview with @entity0 , the @entity39 - backed @entity5 rejected the ad 's allegations and slammed @entity43 for running it			1
" i think he ought to be ashamed of himself , " @entity3 said			1
" in my entire life , i 've written and said a lot of things			0
i 've never said or written anything un-christian in my life			0

@entity3 's campaign told @entity0 on friday that he will take part in a debate monday night			1
he had previously threatened to pull out after @entity7 raised the @entity57 issue			1
@entity7 also resisted questions about the ad at his own campaign events this week			2
the @entity8 candidate and the state 's current attorney general now plans to run more issue - oriented spots in the final days of the campaign , letting the @entity57 ad " run its course			1
" he still defends the commercial			0
" i 'm not questioning @entity3 's faith			2
i 'm questioning his actions , " @entity7 said			2
but some of @entity7 's own supporters in the state have questioned the wisdom of running the ad			1
@entity7 backer and @entity80 judge executive @entity79 told @entity0 , " i might not have done it			2
" @entity79 said he understood why @entity7 ran the spot , noting @entity3 has said " some strange things			1
" a critic of the bank bailouts but a supporter of the new health care law , @entity7 is running in a state where president @entity88 is deeply unpopular			0
he 's opted to campaign with former president @entity89 instead of @entity88			0
when asked about his reluctance to have the current president at his side , @entity7 said , " this campaign 's about me versus @entity3			1
" @entity7 's latest line of attack is that @entity3 once indicated his support for scrapping the income tax , in favor of what conservatives call the " fair tax			1
" it 's essentially a 23 percent national sales tax on all purchases			0
@entity3 told @entity0 he 's open to the idea but not sold on it			2
" i 've always said i 'll support any tax reform that lowers taxes on everyone			0
so that 's sort of the rule of thumb that would have to be			0
and that simplifies the tax code			0
that might be one of the alternatives			0
so would be a flatter income tax , " @entity3 said			0
@entity3 has granted few national media interviews since he won the @entity5 primary in @entity6 earlier this year			0
in the days following that surprise victory , @entity3 's libertarian views came under scrutiny after he raised questions about the 1964 @entity123 and the @entity124 with @entity125			2
@entity3 never imagined his behavior in college would be fair game			0
at his news conference , he said the @entity57 ad would discourage future candidates from running for political office			1
