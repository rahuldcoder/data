-- " @entity1 , " which returns for its fifth and final season july 15 , is one of those shows that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as " @entity6 , " " @entity7 " and " @entity8 " when discussing the greatest tv series of all time			1
last season 's explosive finale saw @entity13 ( @entity14 ) , the teacher - turned - meth - maker , kill his boss , drug kingpin @entity17 , in a horrific , jaw - dropping act that will surely go down as one of the best assassinations in tv history			1
the moment sets expectations incredibly high for these final 16 episodes , which will air in two parts ( the final eight episodes will premiere in the summer of 2013 )			1
when creator @entity28 first pitched the show , he described it as " a story about a man who transforms himself from mr. chips into @entity33			1
" but how do you turn a straight - laced chemistry teacher into a cold - blooded crank cooker and one of tv 's most compelling characters ? after rewatching all 46 episodes , we highlight 10 key moments that show how @entity13 discovered his inner @entity43 ( actually , his inner @entity44			1
as each moment unfolds , @entity46 uses twisted rationalizations to justify his actions , which grow more calculating and manipulative as the series progresses			1
it 's the same sort of manipulation game @entity28 and company are playing with viewers , who first feel sympathy for @entity46 , but by the end of the fourth season are forced to re-evaluate their loyalties			1
if you 've never watched the show and plan on catching up , consider yourself warned : what follows is an entire list of spoilers			1
so what caused a seemingly average family man and teacher to break bad ? let 's begin with ... 1			1
the cancer diagnosis ( pilot , season 1 ) when @entity13 discovers he has terminal lung cancer , he decides to cook meth to provide money for his family after he 's gone			1
even though @entity46 has the brains , he does n't know squat about the drug business			0
when he and his partner , former student @entity81 ( @entity82 ) , attempt to sell their first batch to drug dealers @entity86 - 8 and his cousin , @entity87 , it leads to a hilarious and heart - pounding scene that opens the pilot episode and ends with ... 2			0
@entity91 - 8 in the basement ( " @entity93 ... " season 1 ) to avoid being shot by the two dealers , @entity46 kills them with a chemical gas			1
krazy - 8 survives , @entity87 does n't			0
he 'll be first of many deaths directly and indirectly connected to @entity46			0
because @entity46 does n't have the heart to kill @entity86 - 8 , he keeps him trapped in the basement with a bike lock around his neck			0
with each passing day , @entity46 grows weary of killing @entity91 - 8 , especially when he realizes that @entity91 - 8 may have sold him a baby crib when the dealer worked at his father 's furniture store as a teen			0
it 's only when @entity46 realizes that @entity91 - 8 plans to kill him with a plate shard that he gets up the nerve to choke him			0
@entity46 realizes he 's not cut out for the drug trade			0
pride gets in the way ( " @entity115 , " season 1 ) when his wife ( @entity117 ) reveals @entity46 's illness to a couple of wealthy friends , they offer to pay for his treatments			1
but @entity46 ca n't bring himself to accept charity			0

the killer alter ego ( " @entity131 of @entity132 ' , " season 1 ) enter " @entity44 , " @entity46 's bolder , more cunning alter ego , who literally wears the black ( pork pie ) hat			1
early on , @entity46 slips on the @entity44 persona -- the hat , black glasses , black jacket -- as a way to man up when confronting some unsavory characters			1
but over time , @entity46 grows more comfortable as @entity44 , which allows him to lie to himself and his family , which results in ... 5			0
the " fugue " state ( " @entity148 , " season 2 ) at the start of the series , @entity46 is able to get by with telling little white lies to keep his family in the dark about is drug activities			1
but when he needs to explain an extended absence -- after being kidnapped by another crazy drug dealer , @entity155 -- he comes up with one of his craziest lies yet , which finds him naked in a grocery store with " amnesia			0

her death is the best example of the ripple effect @entity46 's decisions have on everyone around him , including @entity163 's distraught father , an air traffic controller who accidently causes a mid-air collision between a 737 and a commuter plane , killing 167 people			0
though @entity46 feels guilty about @entity163 's death , it 's just another step in the process that allows him to grow comfortable with eliminating threats , including ... 7			0
running over bad guys ( " @entity188 , " season 3 ) to save @entity81 , @entity46 uses his @entity189 , one of best comedic devices ever , as a battering ram to take out two drug dealers who , like @entity46 , work for @entity17			2

just as @entity46 is about to be killed by @entity17 ' henchmen , he 's able to get a message to @entity81 , who does the only thing he can to save his partner			0
more than one , @entity81 has been a victim of @entity46 's bad decisions ( including two very painful beatings ) and killing @entity199 nearly sends @entity81 to the brink			0

bring down the boss ( " @entity218 , " season 4 ) the season finale 's title is a clever play on words that does n't begin to prepare viewers for @entity17 ' grisly demise			2
