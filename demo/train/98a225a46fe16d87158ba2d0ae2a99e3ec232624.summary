" we were higher than @entity45 and it was like ' how dare you , ' " he says			0
" so we had to justify our figures and say ' yes , this really is what is happening here			0
' but it is about growth , it is not about value			0

" people are seeing relatively good returns in @entity1 specifically , but [ also ] in @entity47 as a whole -- particularly with the problems we are seeing in the rest of the world			1
" @entity51 says it 's mostly @entity1 or @entity1 - linked investors that drove the country 's prime housing market to the top spot			1
" a lot of @entity1 in the diaspora in the [ @entity90 ] @entity89 and @entity91 send a lot of money back to @entity1 and a lot of that gets invested in the property market , " he says			1
" so that is another big driver for us			0
" yet , @entity0 is not the only location in @entity1 experiencing great growth in luxury real estate			1
coastal hotspots such as @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 occupied the second spot in @entity107 , recording a 20 % price growth in luxury residential properties			2

@entity118 , a @entity119 - based estate agent , says that @entity1 's coast tugs at people 's heart strings , not just their wallets			1

but agents believe it will only be temporary			0
@entity51 says the country 's market can offer top returns to individual and institutional investors			1
