-- moments after blasting what he called @entity6 's illegal " military aggression " of his nation , @entity2 's interim leader insisted thursday that a peaceful resolution that ends with @entity9 and @entity10 becoming " real partners " is still possible			1
" we still believe that we have a chance to resolve these conflicts in a peaceful manner , " interim prime minister @entity12 told the @entity13			0
@entity12 's remarks come as thousands of @entity6 troops staged military exercises not far from his nation 's border			1
and they are entirely new , given that @entity2 officials have previously called for talks and slammed what they say is @entity6 's military invasion of their country , something that @entity6 president @entity30 has denied			2
still , the stage -- addressing representatives of the world 's most powerful nations , @entity6 among them -- makes the assertions more salient , as does the fast approaching referendum in which residents of the @entity38 will vote whether to secede from @entity2 and join @entity6			1
@entity2 has been simmering since last november , when protesters angry at the sitting government -- in part for its president 's move toward @entity6 and away from the @entity44 -- began hitting the streets			1
in february , after deadly clashes between government forces and demonstrators , president @entity46 was ousted ( he soon took refuge in @entity6 )			0
with that , the focus moved from @entity2 's west , which tends to lean more @entity54 , to its south and east , where ties to @entity6 are stronger			2
rising tensions have centered on @entity38 , where local officials have declared their autonomy from @entity2 and alliance with @entity6 , as armed men have blockaded and taken other actions against @entity2 military and other posts			1
tensions also have spilled over into other parts of eastern @entity2 , such as @entity66 , where the regional health authority said a 22 - year - old man was stabbed to death and at least 10 others were injured in clashes thursday between @entity73 and @entity74 protesters			2
while the bloodshed has been limited so far , fears are percolating that this crisis could turn into a full - scale military conflict			0
" we are looking for an answer to the question of whether the @entity6 want war , " @entity12 said thursday in @entity6			2
" i am sure that , as the prime minister of @entity2 , ( which ) for decades had warm and friendly relations with @entity6 , i am convinced that @entity6 do not want war			1
@entity6 kicks off military drill on thursday , @entity30 reiterated his longstanding stance : @entity2 's crisis was caused by internal factors , not by @entity6			2
and if people in @entity38 -- including ethnic @entity6 -- want to be part of @entity6 , that 's their right and likewise @entity10 's right to protect them			1
speaking after @entity12 at the @entity96 , @entity6 @entity96 ambassador @entity95 accused the @entity97 of having " fanned the flames of unrest " in @entity2 by their officials ' " blatant interference , " which he said contributed to @entity46 's " illegal " ouster			1
since then , the @entity2 's pro-western government has exacerbated the crisis by clamping down on opposition and effectively " splitting this country ( into ) two parts , " @entity95 said			0
as to sunday 's referendum , the ambassador said citizens there deserve the same right to self - determination as anyone : " why should the @entity116 be the exception ? " even as @entity10 has n't said it wants to takeover @entity2 , its military has become noticeably active in the region of late -- and not just its thousands of troops stationed in @entity38			1
its most recent such action was starting military drills thursday involving about 8,500 artillery men in the southern part of the country bordering @entity2 , according to @entity6 's defense ministry			1
@entity129 ambassador to the @entity96 @entity130 portrayed the " new military operations " as connected to the " @entity6 military intervention , " telling the @entity13 on thursday that they involve " artillery batteries , assault helicopters and at least 10,000 additional soldiers near the @entity2 border			1
" these exercises -- which include rocket launchers , howitzers and anti-tank cannons -- aim to " improve the cooperation between artillery ( units ) and motorized rifle forces , tank forces , air cavalry and the marines , " @entity6 's defense ministry said			0
the @entity149 borders @entity2 and includes the @entity150 , the @entity151 and the @entity153 flotilla , the ministry said			0
one of its four bases is in the @entity2 city of @entity157			0
the troops involved in these drills seemingly are in addition to the up to 25,000 @entity6 troops already stationed in @entity2			1
not far away , @entity129 president @entity163 's administration is expected to announce plans to keep the aircraft carrier @entity166 in the @entity167 longer than planned to reassure @entity169 allies who may be feeling insecure after @entity6 's moves in @entity38 , @entity0 has learned			1
asked about the decision to keep the aircraft carrier in the @entity167 , a senior administration official said not to expect much more muscle - flexing , or additional military steps , before sunday			0
@entity2 financial package stalled in @entity177 @entity6 's military activities within @entity2 itself -- including whether its troops are among the men , whose uniforms did not have insignias , who have seemingly marooned @entity2 's military there -- are a matter of intense scrutiny and debate			2
@entity12 stated thursday he has no doubt @entity6 troops have intervened , despite having " no grounds " to do so			2
he said @entity6 's military presence " is clearly identified , " pointing out that vehicles used by some armed men have @entity6 license plates			0
" this is absolutely and entirely unacceptable in the 21st century to resolve any kind of ( conflict ) with boots on the ground , " the interim prime minister said			0
@entity97 officials warn @entity10 @entity97 officials , meanwhile , warned thursday that @entity6 will face significant consequences unless it changes course in @entity38 , with @entity129 president @entity163 pledging to " stand with @entity2			1
" in a speech to the @entity204 parliament , @entity204 chancellor @entity203 said sunday 's secession referendum is unconstitutional and @entity6 's presence in the @entity210 peninsula violates @entity2 's territorial integrity			2
she warned @entity30 that his actions would lead to " catastrophe " for @entity2			0
" it would also change @entity6 economically and politically , " she said			0
in a phone call , @entity216 president @entity215 told @entity30 the referendum " has no legal basis , " urging the @entity6 leader to " do everything to prevent the annexation of @entity38 to @entity6			2
" at a @entity226 committee hearing in @entity227 , @entity129 secretary of state @entity223 -- who is set to meet friday with his @entity6 counterpart -- predicted that the upcoming vote would favor @entity38 rejoining @entity6			1
but he warned that , absent movement by @entity6 toward negotiating with @entity2 on the crisis , " there will be a very serious series of steps monday in @entity54 and here			2
" already , the @entity236 - based @entity235 said it had postponed activities related to @entity6 's process for membership in the organization			0
in a boost to @entity9 , members also " agreed that the @entity235 should respond positively to @entity2 's request to further strengthen existing @entity235 - @entity2 cooperation to take advantage of the @entity235 's expertise to address the public policy challenges it faces			0
" ' @entity30 's opinion is much more important ' @entity38 is on edge , as evidenced by flaring tensions and growing worries as evidenced by long lines at banks in the regional capital of @entity255			0
separately , @entity38 authorities have secured offshore @entity2 oil and gas projects in the @entity263 and @entity264 seas , as well as the @entity267 company 's oil and gas fields , @entity6 's state - run @entity257 news agency reported thursday , citing @entity38 parliamentary speaker @entity268			1
" these deposits and the platform fully become the property of the @entity272 , " he said			0
" we have guarded them			0
these are our fields and we will fight for them			0
" a decision on @entity2 's @entity267 has not been made , @entity6 's @entity278 news agency reported , citing @entity38 deputy prime minister @entity280			1
he said consultations would take place on whether " this enterprise will remain the property of the @entity272 or will become part of @entity285 , " the @entity6 energy giant			0
@entity2 's armed forces deployed in @entity38 have been bottled up since late last month , but they 're free to leave their bases to vote in the referendum , said @entity290 , the @entity38 government 's official in charge of the ballot , according to @entity278			1
@entity290 said officials had visited military bases across @entity38 to convince soldiers that " they have simply become hostage of the @entity2 government " and to understand that " the only way to maintain the peace and unity of the @entity38 people is by forming a union with @entity6			1
" the new , @entity74 government on the southeastern peninsula has said that if the voters opt to join @entity6 , the first step would be to declare @entity38 an independent and sovereign state			1
then it will apply to join the @entity6			0
@entity310 : comparing @entity2 and @entity6 's military forces @entity0 's @entity312 reported from @entity255 , as did journalist @entity313			2
@entity0 's @entity314 in @entity255 , @entity315 and @entity316 in @entity10 , @entity317 in @entity9 , and @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 , @entity328 and @entity329 contributed to this report .			0
