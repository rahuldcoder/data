@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 voters are considering an unusual question that will appear on their ballots this tuesday : whether @entity7 law can be used in considering cases in state court			1
the question is the doing of state rep. @entity10			0
the @entity11 is the main author of @entity13 , also known as the " @entity18 " constitutional amendment , one of 11 questions on the state ballot			2
the question might seem a befuddling one for a ballot in the heartland , but it stems from a @entity22 legal case in which a @entity24 woman went to a family court asking for a restraining order against her spouse claiming he had raped her repeatedly			1
the judge ruled against her , saying that her husband was abiding by his @entity24 beliefs regarding spousal duties			1
the decision was later overruled by an appellate court , but the case sparked a firestorm			2
@entity10 secured support for the proposal on the state 's @entity40 side from fellow @entity11 @entity42 , who co-authored the measure			1
" the fact that @entity46 law was even considered anywhere in the @entity48 is enough for me " to sign on , @entity42 told @entity2			1
" it should scare anyone that any judge in @entity48 would consider using that as precedent			2
" @entity42 said his concern was compounded by @entity58 @entity57 's comments during her confirmation hearings in june that she would be willing to consider international law when considering cases before the court			2
@entity63 , president of the @entity64 of @entity0 who runs the @entity66 at the @entity67 of @entity0 , said there are more than 5,000 muslims in the city			0
while there are no exact numbers for the @entity24 population in the state , it is not among the larger communities , said @entity77 of the @entity78 " it 's just fear mongering ; it 's nothing , " @entity63 told @entity2			1
" what 's @entity46 law have to do with @entity1 ? " some 1,200 muslims from @entity84 , @entity85 , the @entity86 , @entity87 and elsewhere participate in services at the @entity66 of @entity0 , according to @entity89 the facility , founded by @entity0 cardiologist @entity91 , has been open for about two years			1
another @entity7 center is just two miles away			0
@entity63 insists that @entity7 does not allow for men to mistreat women , and that the @entity22 case involved a " crazy , loony man , unfortunately a @entity24			1
" " that is not @entity7 , " he said			0
" @entity1 , you know , is a very @entity11 state , " @entity63 said			1
he accused some lawmakers with attempting to instill fear in the heads of constituents in order to drum up votes			0
" but @entity106 are not like that			0
i know most of the @entity106			0
they 're very nice people			0
" as written on the ballot , the measure states it would amend a state constitution section dealing with the state courts , making them " rely on federal and state law when deciding cases , forbidding them " from considering or using international law " and " from considering or using @entity46			1
" the ballot then briefly describes international law , which " deals with the conduct of international organizations and independent nations , such as countries , states and tribes , " and @entity46 , which is " based on two principal sources , the @entity128 and the teaching of @entity130			1
" " shall the proposal be approved ? " the ballot reads , instructing voters to respond ' yes ' if they 're for the proposal and ' no ' if they 're against it			1
former @entity48 speaker of the house @entity135 touched on the issue during a speech to the fifth annual @entity139 in @entity140 in september			0
" i am totally opposed to any effort to impose @entity46 on the @entity48 , and we should have a federal law that says under no circumstance , in any jurisdiction in the @entity48 , will @entity46 be used in any court to apply to any judgment made about @entity48 law , " @entity141 said			1
@entity1 's proposed constitutional amendment coincides with heated discussion regarding a 13 - story @entity66 planned for two blocks from the @entity153 in @entity154			1
the state had its own encounter with terrorism in 1995 when the @entity158 was struck by a bomb			0
@entity160 was convicted for the attack , which killed 168 people , including 19 children			0
@entity160 was not a muslim			0
the activist group @entity165 , a self - described issues advocacy organization , recently launched a $ 45,000 grass - roots campaign in @entity1 to urge voters to support @entity13			2
the group sponsored a one - minute radio ad airing across the state that warns against @entity46			2
in the ad , a voice says , " a husband was brutally beating and raping his wife several times a day			0
desperate to save her life , this @entity24 woman sought a restraining order against him			2
but the judge ruled against her , saying her husband had not committed a crime			0
" the commercial then said this case happened not in @entity186 or @entity187 , but in @entity22			2
" this is just one chilling example of how @entity7 @entity46 law has begun to penetrate @entity48 , " the ad continued			2
" help us stop @entity46 law from coming to @entity1			1
" the group is also sponsoring automated phone calls to @entity1 voters from former @entity196 director and @entity1 native @entity197			2
" we must realize there is a major campaign in @entity200 to impose @entity46 law and @entity46 is beginning to be cited in a few @entity48 courts			1
it is completely incompatible with our @entity206 , " says @entity197 , who also says that he is not advocating interference with muslims practicing their religion			0
despite the publicity , many @entity106 are unfamiliar with the proposed amendment , which is largely overshadowed by another ballot question proposing that the state annually fund public education to a minimum of the per - student average of neighboring states			0
another proposal , @entity13 751 , would make @entity217 the official language of @entity1			1
those voters who are familiar with the @entity46 initiative are largely inclined to vote for it , but few who spoke with @entity2 were very excited about it			2
@entity223 , a legal assistant , said she supports the measure			0
" i do n't know that it would make much difference , but if there is something that comes up that has to do with @entity7 law , or treating women that way , i do n't want them to be treated badly and i do n't want us to have any problem with the way they treat them in court either , " @entity225 said			0
lawyer @entity239 said he would probably vote for the proposal , but he does n't feel strongly about it one way or the other			0
" i do n't think there 's much of a chance of @entity46 law becoming any kind of law in @entity1 , " said @entity239			1
" there are much more important issues			0
" @entity42 admits the notion of @entity46 taking precedence in @entity1 's courts is not looming on voters ' minds			1
" it 's not a problem and we want to keep it that way , " he said			0
" and we hope this state question will have that effect , to make it crystal clear that that 's not to be considered in @entity1 , nor is international law			1

ballot proposal would ban @entity46 from being considered in @entity1 courts
a @entity22 judge who took @entity24 beliefs into account sparked the proposal
" it 's just fear mongering , " a @entity24 leader says
