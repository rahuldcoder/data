-- gen. @entity5 , a bespectacled college professor turned soldier in the defense of the @entity9 , often returned to @entity10 , that legendary battlefield where on a grim and terrible july day in 1863 , @entity1 and his regiment , the 20th @entity4 , held the extreme left flank of the @entity12 against an attack by near overwhelming odds , launched by equally gallant troops from @entity16			2
@entity1 's regiment held the line			1
as the years passed , the @entity20 recipient would go back to @entity10 with comrades to contemplate and to pray			2
he came to call that hallowed ground the " @entity24			2
" he wrote that where great deeds were accomplished , a " spirit " of greatness lingered			2
what would he and his comrades , and those who faced them beneath that hot july sun say to us today ? for our " @entity24 , " are now off limits , forbidden lands , " @entity36 " to all			2
what would they say to us ? in what is described as a government shutdown , the @entity44 around @entity45 is still jammed with the commuters to federal offices , @entity41 and congressional staffers continue to work , but by a highly selective process , our national memorials to the living and fallen who served in @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 are closed			1
few veterans have the means to travel to remote islands of the @entity63 , the beaches of @entity59 , the woods of the @entity56 and @entity57 to visit but one more time their " @entity70 , " where with family and comrades they can say , " here i fought , " or say , " here is where my friend @entity65 -- remember my telling you about him ? -- here is where he died			1
" for them , the monuments have become their ' @entity24 , " their gathering place , the place of remembrance , of pride , and of tears			1
to selectively close off such places is nothing less than vindictive , a national disgrace that @entity83 have allowed to continue for more than a week after its implementation			1
but far more egregious has been the closing of our military cemeteries overseas			1
@entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , in remembrance of the supreme sacrifice made by so many @entity94 , deeded to us in perpetuity the land where tens of thousands now rest beneath crosses and stars of @entity100 , row upon row			1
those few acres are , forever , the soil , the very soul of @entity94			1
it is fashionable for some to view current @entity107 politics and policies with disdain			2
but when it comes to the sacrifice in blood we gave for their freedom , believe me , there is still utmost respect on their part			2
when i travel there with veterans , they are greeted with respect , warmth , handshakes , embraces and tears			0
while we appear to have forgotten , they have not			0
i have traveled twice to @entity131 with a veteran of that assault			0
most of you who read this have seen the movie " @entity139 , " the opening scene when @entity140 , now an old man , walks into the cemetery and stops at the grave of his comrade and all but collapses			0
i have been there , i have seen that for real			0
i personally call the pathway from the parking lot , to where the walkway turns and suddenly you behold the thousands upon thousands of graves , the " place of tears			0
" i call it that for the reaction of nearly all is the same			0
a slowing of pace as they turn the corner of the pathway and behold the cemetery for the first time			0
nearly all stop for a moment , and so many ( myself included ) begin to weep			0
i will never forget my elderly friend , after checking into a small office to find the resting place of a friend amid all those thousands of graves , stoically pressed on until he found the grave he was looking for , and then the tears flowed			0
now that place is off - limits to veterans , to families looking for the resting place of a loved one , for so many of us who just felt a heart driven need to come and offer our respect and thanks , we are barricaded off , denied , almost as if it is still enemy - occupied territory			0
a few acres of hallowed ground of @entity94 , that our own government now forbids us to visit			1
this is no longer a fight about a budget , about " @entity190 , " about the intransigence of a few in @entity193 , and i state that regardless of whom you might blame			0
this is about arrogance , about heartless disregard			0
it is about a shameful display of self - aggrandizing power that shouts " i forbid , " and @entity83 , descendants of our @entity204 forefathers are expected to obey with heads bowed and turn away in obedience			0
the @entity208 of the @entity94 empowers the president to serve as commander - in - chief of our armed services			1
mr. president , you have the power to take down the barricades to our " @entity217			1
" i challenge you , mr. president , that there is a simple alternative to what is now transpiring			1
detail but a few hundred military police to stand guard instead			1
there is not a man or woman in uniform who would not volunteer for such service , for the honor to stand watch over their comrades			0
mr. president , tear down the barricades of dishonor			1
let serving members of our military stand watch instead			2
denying @entity241 our " @entity217 " is an act of dishonor that will not be forgotten ... or forgiven			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity246 .			1

@entity246 : there 's no *excuse* for closing military memorials
he says such places are special , particularly for those who fought for the @entity94
@entity246 : president should use active military police to guard these monuments
