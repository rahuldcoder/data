-- a broader legal challenge to @entity3 's so - called " employer mandate " was turned aside by the @entity4 on monday			1
the justices , without comment , again refused to intervene in @entity8 's long - running appeal of the @entity3			1
it marked the second time in two years the court has declined to review the constitutionality of requirements for most large employers to offer a range of health insurance coverage for their workers			0
two narrowly focused petitions over the health law will be heard by the court in coming months			0
they involve whether some companies can refuse on religious grounds to provide insurance for certain birth control and other reproductive health services , without a co-pay			0
arguments will likely be held in march and a ruling is expected by late june			0
in 2012 , the @entity4 narrowly upheld the health law 's funding mechanism , the so - called " individual mandate " that requires nearly all @entity35 to purchase health insurance or pay a financial penalty			1
the justices tossed out all other pending appeals at that time , but left room for continued legal challenges to certain aspects of @entity3 's application			1
@entity44 , @entity45 - based @entity8 , which bills itself the largest @entity47 evangelical college in the world , refiled its lawsuit , saying its objections should be reconsidered in light of the court 's 5 - 4 ruling affirming the overall law			2
it sought an exemption , believing @entity35 should not be required to purchase health insurance -- and employers forced to provide it -- if there are legitimate moral and religious objections to some provisions			0
a three - judge panel of the 4th @entity63 unanimously concluded in 2011 that the suit should be blocked on jurisdictional grounds			0
while the @entity4 for now will allow the employer mandate to go ahead , there are other pending lawsuits working their way through the lower federal courts , which could force an eventual constitutional showdown			1
the administration said last month it would delay online implementation of the employer mandate -- affecting companies with 50 or more workers -- for another year , to give those busineses more time to prepare for the new regulations and requirements			2
the case rejected monday is @entity8 v. @entity81 ( 13 - 306 ) .			2
