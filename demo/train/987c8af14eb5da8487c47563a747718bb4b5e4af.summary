-- most @entity1 do n't think that midterm elections really matter			1
the majority of voters come out only for presidential elections			2
midterms are left to the most activist parts of the population , the people who like to follow politics in off hours and who care as deeply about who wins elected office as they do about sports teams or celebrities			0
that 's a big mistake			2
midterms play a huge role in shaping @entity1 politics , and this year 's could be especially significant			1
traditionally , the party of the president does poorly			0
the 1938 midterm elections created a conservative coalition of southern @entity24 and @entity25 that stifled @entity26 and subsequent @entity28 presidents for decades to come			1
the 1958 midterms emboldened @entity31 liberals to push a new agenda , while the 1966 midterms killed any remaining momentum @entity35 had for his @entity36			0
in 1994 , @entity25 reshaped the discourse of @entity38 by taking control of @entity40 , while @entity24 put a kibosh on president @entity43 's initiatives when they took it back in 2006			1
this year , the stakes are big			2
while @entity25 will certainly retain control of the @entity47 , it is unclear whether @entity24 will continue to control a majority of the @entity49			1
the importance of this outcome is enormous and will have huge consequences in the coming two years			0
why does control of the @entity49 matter so much , especially in an era where @entity40 seems so gridlocked that it ca n't accomplish anything ? the most important reason is that the @entity49 @entity28 majority is the only effective counterweight to the immense power that the tea party @entity25 can wield within the @entity61			1
house speaker @entity62 has proved repeatedly that he is unable to control the 25 to 30 members of his caucus who have continued to push the party sharply to the right and who have refused to enter into any kind of compromises with the @entity24 on matters such as immigration			2
impotent as a leader , @entity62 has ironically depended on his ability to tell colleagues that they are wasting their time in the @entity47 if they adopt tea party positions that the @entity24 wo n't accept			1
if @entity25 gain control of the @entity49 in november , he wo n't have that check to point to anymore and we can see the @entity25 shift even further to the right			1
with control of the majority , @entity24 still have the power that social scientists call " agenda setting			1
" although passing legislation is obviously the prime goal of members of @entity40 , their other function is to get issues on the table and ensure that public debate continues on key problems			0
by doing that , they can keep legislative proposals alive and when the right moment hits , usually some kind of crisis , their proposals are ready to go forward			0
immigration reform would likely have withered on the legislative vine of gridlock had not @entity24 sent the @entity47 a comprehensive reform bill and kept pressure on the lower chamber to deal with the issue			2
immigration reform is dead for the rest of the @entity40 , but it is an issue people are still talking about and proposals will be back on the table if @entity24 have their say about it			2
a @entity49 majority is also key to the future of the courts			1
@entity24 scored a huge victory when they changed the rules so that the minority could not filibuster against judicial and executive appointments ( other than the @entity122 )			1
this has already streamlined the appointment process and resulted in a burst of nominations being confirmed			0
in coming years , we 're likely to see numerous court battles , including the replacement of justice @entity130 if she retires			0
@entity130 is a vital liberal voice on a @entity122 that has proved to be increasingly conservative			0
if @entity25 gain control of the @entity49 , the @entity47 will be in big trouble with its appointments			1
republicans will be able to block ratification of a strong progressive nominee and the @entity47 would find itself under enormous pressure to move toward the center in choosing appointments if they are going to have a chance of confirmation			0
control over the @entity49 also matters because it will be one of the first major stories of the 2016 election campaign for the @entity47			2
if @entity25 gain control of the @entity49 , it will spark a conversation about 2016 that begins with talk of how @entity24 have become weaker politically as a result of @entity153 's troubles and how @entity25 -- despite all their own approval rating problems -- are on the upswing			1
this would certainly provide a boost to their party and a good framework for @entity25 presidential nominees to start their campaigns			0
if @entity24 retain control of the @entity49 , it would have a very different effect			1
the storyline for the 2016 election would begin with the ability of @entity24 to check the @entity25 resurgence			2
the @entity25 civil war would become more intense , with the right blaming the party 's establishment for crushing more conservative candidates in the primaries and the establishment blaming the right for forcing candidates to take positions that are politically unpopular			0
the midterms are a big deal			0
what happens to the @entity49 will play a very important role in the direction of @entity1 politics in the coming years , even if @entity40 remains in its current dysfunctional state			1
@entity1 should not be complacent			0
do n't leave the election to the activists			0
join us on @entity190 / @entity189 .			0

most @entity1 consider midterm elections *insignificant* ; many do n't vote
@entity195 : midterms can make a big difference , and this year 's vote is huge
if @entity24 lose @entity49 majority , @entity153 's woes would only grow
@entity195 : *democrats* would lose influence , and replacing judges would be very *difficult*
