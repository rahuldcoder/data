-- yes , i admit this was n't the first time i 'd forgotten an important event			2
let 's not get hung up on that			2
what 's important is that i quickly and admirably redeemed myself			2
for a refreshing walk , try a sliver of the @entity11 coastline , about 50 miles south of @entity12			1
once the florist came to deliver the white dendrobium ( i collect orchids ) and i read the note -- " @entity16			2
@entity18 , @entity17 " -- i immediately jumped into action : in less than an hour , i 'm driving my wife , @entity20 , to @entity11 , our favorite seaside village			1
it is a place blessedly stocked with eateries where a guy can get noteworthy huevos rancheros while his beloved browses chic shops along @entity28 and @entity29 for bejeweled sandals during winter sales			1
@entity11 also happens to be where we spent a few days on our honeymoon years ago , so i have that going for me			1
short of hiring a helicopter , there are only two ways to get to this gallery - filled artist colony , either along @entity40 's @entity39 or down eucalyptus - laden @entity41 , which curves like a riverbed , flowing down to the sea from the base of steep hills dotted with aerie bright - white homes that look like seagulls perched on precipices			2
as we roll into town just before sunset , we feel like we 're dropping into a box canyon with the @entity28 as its only outlet , making the village feel cozy and isolated , particularly in the fall and winter months when the crowds thin out			1
a chilly breeze brings the faint smell of menthol ( the canyon 's eucalyptus trees ) and something sweet , like saltwater taffy , perhaps from one of the candy stores			2
long sheets of purplish orange clouds scatter like flaming blankets across the sky , suffusing the ocean , the sky , even @entity20 's face with a fireside glow			2
" this is such a special treat , " she says			2
" i ca n't believe you thought of it			2
by the way , where are we staying ? " fortunately , i 'm prepared for this question			2
i 've been turning it over in my head from the moment we left home			2
i was thinking we could try to get a room at the hotel where we 'd spent three nights on our honeymoon , even though it was n't that great			0
but then my spousal guilt kicks in , so i decide to bite the bullet and go all out at @entity94 resort and spa : @entity97 architecture			0
plein air art lining lobby walls			1
views of @entity11 's beaches			1
jaw - dropping room rates			0
beach romance when we get up the next morning , the sun warming up the room , @entity20 and i both notice the quiet			1
with doors open wide to the @entity28 , we hear the chest - thumping crash of the waves , the raspy bark of sea lions , the singsongy entreaty of a distant jogger calling his dog back from a run on the beach			1
i say we love the quiet , then i talk about the sounds			0
in summer , beach sounds can be cacophonous			1
in fall and winter , there 's mostly the wind and waves and sea life			1
we love the communal feel of the town at this time of year , when locals , who seem to hibernate during the hot months , suddenly reappear to reclaim their favorite eateries and bars			1
one morning we laze about @entity134 on boutique - lined @entity135 , reading the paper while digging into massive bowls of oatmeal mixed with dried cherries and nuts and surreptitiously listening to the breezy conversation around us -- like that of the young woman at the next table who 's trying to convince a friend to join her in a laughter - yoga workshop on the beach			1
" at first you just feel really stupid going hee - hee - hee , haw - haw - haw , but then you really do start laughing and it ... it 's such a release , " she says			0
" what the heck is laughter yoga ? " i lean over and whisper to jan. she raises her eyebrows , perplexed , and we both try hard not to laugh			0
fishing for adventure for exercise , we hike down from @entity39 to @entity163 , a secluded cove hardly anyone goes to , particularly off - season			1
i take moody black - and - white photos of @entity20 on a sea - worn rock in front of an odd little castle turret on the beach , a tower built almost 80 years ago by an early inhabitant who was looking to camouflage spiraling stairs to his house -- long gone -- on the bluff above us			1
we do a lot of beach walking , particularly just before cocktail hour in the late afternoon			1
strolling down @entity180 beach , we come across couples cozy on their blankets , and chilled surf fishermen slapping their hands together while keeping a watchful eye on their poles			1
that night we enjoy dinner at @entity11 restaurant , where the old @entity189 , a local landmark , sat for 60 years			1
we huddle around a firepit on the patio , looking over the roofs of shops along the highway to where the sun is dipping into the dark ocean , and nosh on homemade rosemary and sea - salt potato chips while quaffing @entity202 dark ale			1
and while it is n't exactly my favorite adventure , in the spirit of the weekend i join @entity20 one afternoon while she pokes around the shops of @entity212 , perched on a bluff above the ocean , trying not to act too annoyed when she insists i sniff herbal - scented candles or try on goofy - looking leather hats , the type worn by guys with walrus mustaches and jackets with fringe			1
in short , we do everything and nothing at all , which is really the best thing about @entity11 at this time of year			1
and i think @entity20 appreciated my efforts			0
which may explain why she seems completely unruffled when i confess that i had , indeed , forgotten our anniversary			0
" of course you did , " she says as we head back home			0
" why do you think i sent the orchid ? " a more cynical man might suspect that she 'd engineered the whole weekend herself			0
but what are the odds of that ? getting there @entity11 is 50 miles south of @entity12 and 75 miles north of @entity229 ; @entity230 is 15 miles away			1
