-- president @entity1 used the growing oil spill in the @entity3 to renew his pitch for alternative energy wednesday , arguing that the unfolding environmental disaster " gives you a sense of where we 're going " without comprehensive reform			1
the federal government is " going to bring every resource necessary to put a stop " to the spill , the president said during a visit to a solar panel manufacturing facility in @entity14 , @entity15			0
" we will not rest until this well is shut , the environment is repaired , and the cleanup is complete			0
" but , he added , " a lot of damage has been done already			0
the spill in the @entity3 , which is just heartbreaking , only underscores the necessity " of seeking alternative fuel sources			2
a failure to enact comprehensive energy reform , he argued , would pose a threat to national security and the economy , as well as the environment			2
@entity1 's remarks came two weeks after sens. @entity38 , @entity39 , and @entity40 , an independent from @entity41 , introduced a sweeping energy and climate change bill intended to cut @entity45 greenhouse gas emissions while reshaping the energy sector			1
the @entity47 passed its own energy bill last year , and @entity1 has said he backs the efforts by @entity38 and @entity40 to move the issue forward in the @entity51			2
the president asked for @entity51 @entity54 cooperation on the issue during a closed - door meeting tuesday with republicans on @entity58			0
however , senate majority leader @entity59 , @entity60 , has indicated he wants immigration reform to take priority , and the politics of midterm congressional elections in november raises questions about the the possibility of gaining final approval this year of such major legislation as energy reform			1
@entity59 's position caused a potential @entity54 co-sponsor , sen. @entity72 of @entity73 , to drop out of the talks with @entity40 and @entity38 on drafting the proposal			1
the proposal addresses a range of energy issues , including expanded nuclear power production , incentives for the coal industry to seek cleaner methods , money to develop alternative energy sources and programs to help @entity45 industry in the transition to a low - carbon system			2
on climate change , the measure seeks escalating reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in coming decades that match the levels set as goals by the @entity1 administration and contained in the @entity47 bill			0
among other things , the proposal calls for emissions reductions from 2005 levels of 17 percent by 2020 , 42 percent by 2030 and 83 percent by 2050			0
the @entity51 proposal includes expanded offshore oil drilling as part of a strategy to increase domestic production			1
however , provisions strengthening the ability of states to prevent more drilling off their coasts were added in the wake of the @entity3 oil spill			1
@entity0 's @entity112 and @entity113 contributed to this report .			0
