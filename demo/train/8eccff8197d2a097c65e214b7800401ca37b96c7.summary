-- unrest intensified over the weekend in @entity2 , further raising fears of a civil war or invasion by @entity6			1
on friday , 46 people died in clashes in the port city of @entity10			0
on sunday , @entity12 forces stormed the city 's police station and secured the freedom of protesters who had been arrested as part of friday 's unrest			0
here 's a look at the situation on the ground in @entity2 and what might happen should the violence continue to escalate : is @entity2 sliding toward civil war ? it 's a very real possibility , analysts say			1
@entity6 appears to be guiding the country in that direction by inciting unrest between pro-russian interests and @entity2 forces , said former @entity33 diplomat @entity32			1
by sowing the seeds of unrest , @entity6 can make it appear that the government in @entity37 is incapable of governing			2
" so i think the @entity6 have a real interest in keeping this type of crisis going , hoping it can even go to a kind of civil war and basically justify whatever it is that they want to do , " @entity32 said sunday on @entity0			1
will @entity6 send in troops to support its interests in eastern @entity2 ? @entity6 officials have said all along that they reserve the right to send troops into @entity2 to protect @entity6 citizens and @entity6 speakers against violence and discrimination by what they 've termed the fascist , @entity58 government in @entity37			1
the risk of such an intervention will increase if @entity2 's military operation against pro-russian forces results in significant casualties , @entity59 's concluded last week			1
the latest @entity33 intelligence shows no signs of an imminent invasion , a senior @entity33 official told @entity0			0
would it take advantage of the opportunity to annex a @entity12 part of @entity73 ? although there 's no sign of any such move , @entity75 's commander , gen. @entity74 , said in late march that he feared @entity6 had amassed enough troops to roll across @entity2 and take @entity80 , a separatist , @entity12 region of @entity73			1
" we know that capability absolutely exists to do that and cause that problem , " he said march 23			0
" we do n't know about the intent			0
what we do see is some of the same rhetoric that was used when they went into @entity90			0
so if that is the first intention of -- indication of intent , then that 's very worrisome			0
" what do we know about the capabilities of the @entity2 military ? @entity2 has about 139,000 troops , 735 tanks and 25 ships			2
it spent about $ 1.6 billion on its military in 2012			0
compare that to @entity6 , which spent $ 78 billion on its military in 2012 and has 774,500 troops			2
analysts say @entity2 's military is built more to guard against internal unrest and is not geared toward preventing an invasion			1
was n't @entity2 once part of @entity6 ? it has spent more time as part of @entity6 or the @entity111 than it has as an independent country since the late 1700s , when the @entity6 empire conquered it			2
it was briefly independent shortly after @entity114 but then became part of the @entity111 , where it remained until that regime ended in 1991 .			0

analysts say civil war in @entity2 is a real possibility
violence also *heightens* concerns over @entity6 's intentions
@entity2 's military is *dwarfed* by @entity6 's
