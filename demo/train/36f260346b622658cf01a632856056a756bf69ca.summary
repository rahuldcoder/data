@entity1 hopes to set an example to bigger nations by relying totally on clean energy by 2020			1
located between @entity7 and @entity8 , the tiny @entity9 nation is one of the world 's climate change hotspots and many believe it is already seeing the negative affects of rising sea levels			1
the highest elevation on the island is just 4.5 meters ( 14.8 feet ) , and king tides have become increasingly damaging over the past 10 years , threatening the homes and livelihoods of its 12,000 inhabitants			0

according to e8 figures , after 14 months in operation the solar stadium has reduced consumption of generator fuel shipped from @entity50 by 17,000 tons and saved 50 tons of co2 from being released in the atmosphere			0
a further benefit is the reduced risk of diesel spills around the atoll 's reefs			0
" there may be other larger solar power installations in the world , but none could be more meaningful to customers than this one , " said @entity58 , general manager of the @entity59 that helped implement the scheme			0
" the plight of @entity1 versus the rising tide vividly represents the worst early consequence of climate change			1
for @entity1 , after 3,000 years of history , the success of @entity75 climate talks in @entity76 this december may well be a matter of national survival , " he said in a press statement			2

" we thank those who are helping @entity1 reduce its carbon footprint as it will strengthen our voice in upcoming international negotiations			2
and we look forward to the day when our nation offers an example to all -- powered entirely by natural resources such as the sun and the wind , " said @entity90 , @entity1 's minister for public utilities and industries .			2
