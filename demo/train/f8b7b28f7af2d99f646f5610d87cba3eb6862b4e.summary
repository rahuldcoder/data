-- @entity1 may believe the @entity3 title race is already over but reigning champions @entity4 kept alive their slim hopes of retaining the crown with monday 's 1 - 0 win at @entity8			1
the victory cut the gap on arch rivals and championship leaders @entity13 to 12 points with 10 matches of the @entity3 season remaining , including a return clash between the top two at the beginning of april			1
it was a disciplined display from @entity21 's men , who owed their victory to a neatly - taken goal by @entity25 international @entity24 just before halftime			1
defeat left @entity8 deep in relegation trouble in 18th place with just 24 points in the bag			2
while @entity1 's @entity33 team were training at @entity4 's @entity34 ahead of their @entity36 clash with @entity13 , their temporary landlords were making their way to the testing fixture at @entity40 , knowing dropped points would end all hopes in the title race			1
an even first half offered @entity46 's strugglers hope they could at least get something from the match and striker @entity49 was a threat throughout with his muscular presence			2
at the other end @entity52 rattled the @entity8 woodwork , but a defensive mistake just before the interval was to cost the home side dear			0
defender @entity58 was robbed by substitute @entity59 -- on after @entity61 midfielder @entity60 went off with a hamstring problem -- and the @entity63 played in @entity24			0
he cleverly dummied goalkeeper @entity64 and slotted the ball home			0
after the break there was almost a repeat as this time @entity71 was caught napping by @entity59 but the defender got back to clear @entity24 's shot off the line			0
@entity49 continued to be a nuisance to the end , but @entity4 defended stoutly to move five points clear of third - placed @entity77 , who had closed to within two after sunday 's derby win over @entity80			1
@entity21 was delighted with his team 's efforts			0
" i think it is very important to win this game			0
for us it was important to stay 12 points behind , the championship is not over , " he told @entity85			2
and he had a word of consolation for @entity8			0
" i think they will stay in the @entity3 , " he predicted			0
meanwhile , in monday 's @entity95 action , @entity93 won 4 - 1 at home to third - bottom @entity97 to move up to 10th place			1
striker @entity99 scored a fine hat - trick to take his tally to 13 in the league this season .			1
