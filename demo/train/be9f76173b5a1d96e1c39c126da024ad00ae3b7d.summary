a @entity1 family is fighting to protect its beloved pit bull from a " vicious dogs " ordinance			1
@entity6 started an online petition to protect pit bull @entity8 from an uncertain fate			1
the petition , which asks the village of @entity13 to reverse a " vicious dog " ban against pit bulls and rottweilers , has drawn nearly 40,000 signatures			1
@entity8 is far from a vicious dog , @entity19 told @entity21			1
he provides love and support for her children , especially daughter @entity26 , who suffers from severe neck problems and uses a @entity29 brace and a wheelchair			1
" if anything ever happened to him , i would just shut down , " @entity26 told @entity31			0
@entity8 acts as a sort of therapy dog for @entity26 , @entity19 told @entity21			1
he sleeps by @entity26 's side every night ; if @entity26 wakes up with seizures , he rouses her mother			0
the family has asked local officials to consider the special circumstances , only to be told there 's nothing they can do , @entity19 told @entity21			2
the village of @entity13 passed an ordinance in october banning pit bulls and rottweilers as of december 1			1
owners of the animals received a letter saying that pets found within the corporate limits of @entity13 after that date will be " impounded and transported to a veterinary clinic for further disposition , " according to a letter posted on the family 's facebook page			2
the mayor and alderman of @entity13 did not respond to @entity21 's repeated requests for comment			0
alderman @entity63 told @entity31 that the ordinance was created to placate residents in the small village			0
" we had several residents that were complaining about not being able to walk along the neighborhoods because these dogs were basically running along town , " @entity63 said , according to @entity31			0
@entity13 is not the first to pass a ordinance restricting the ownership of pit bulls , rottweilers or other so - called " vicious dogs			1
" but the @entity78 recommends breed neutral laws " that focus , not on breed , but on people 's responsibility for their dogs ' behavior , including measures that hold owners of all breeds accountable for properly housing , supervising and controlling their dogs			2
" the @entity90 also signaled its opposition to breed - specific legislation in 2013 , saying " research shows that bans on certain types of dogs are largely ineffective and often a waste of public resources			0
" several states have passed legislation banning local governments from introducing breed - specific laws or ordinances			0
besides , pit bulls are not a breed of dog			1
several breeds of dogs , mainly the @entity108 , the bull dog and the @entity110 are commonly referred to as " pit bulls			1
" these dogs descended from an @entity114 bull - baiting dog bred to bite and hold bulls , bears and other large animals around the face and head , according to the @entity78			2
they were later bred with terriers to produce a more agile , athletic type dog			0
" it is likely that that the vast majority of pit bull type dogs in our communities today are the result of random breeding -- two dogs being mated without regard to the behavioral traits being passed on to their offspring			2
the result of random breeding is a population of dogs with a wide range of behavioral predispositions			0
for this reason it is important to evaluate and treat each dog , no matter its breed , as an individual			0
