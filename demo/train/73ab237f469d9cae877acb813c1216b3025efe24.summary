@entity0 -- the diplomatic drama over @entity3 showed promising signs of a resolution friday , with @entity6 indicating the activist could apply to travel to the @entity8 and @entity9 announcing it has invited him to be a visiting scholar			1
@entity6 was incensed after @entity3 , who broke out of house arrest , sought refuge at the @entity14 in @entity0			1
he left the embassy after six days and went to a hospital , where he was reunited with his wife and their two children			0
since then , he has made several pleas to be allowed to leave @entity6 , including a call to a @entity8 congressional hearing			1
@entity6 's decision to allow @entity3 to travel abroad to study was seen as a significant sign of progress in what has been a thorny and controversial impasse			1
" as a @entity6 citizen , he may apply like other @entity6 citizens according to the laws and normal procedures of the relevant departments , " said @entity28 , a spokesman for the @entity29			1
secretary of state @entity35 said the @entity8 was " encouraged " by @entity28 's statement			2
" from the beginning , all of our efforts with mr. @entity3 have been guided by his choices and our values , and i 'm pleased that today our ambassador has spoken with him again , our embassy staff and our doctor had a chance to meet with him , and he confirms that he and his family now want to go to the @entity8 so he can pursue his studies , " she told reporters in @entity0			1
@entity9 said friday it has invited @entity3 to be a visiting scholar , working with its law programs			1
@entity3 would be in @entity53 or one of the university 's global sites , the university said in a statement , adding that the blind activist , 40 , has " long - established relationships " with faculty at the @entity60			2
@entity62 spokeswoman @entity61 earlier said @entity3 had been offered a fellowship from an @entity8 university , where he could be accompanied by his wife and children			1
" the @entity6 government has indicated that it will accept mr. @entity3 's applications for appropriate travel documents , " @entity61 said			1
" the @entity8 government expects that the @entity6 government will expeditiously process his applications for these documents , and make accommodations for his current medical condition			1
the @entity8 government would then give visa requests for him and his immediate family priority attention			2
" @entity8 ambassador to @entity6 @entity77 , who spoke with @entity3 by phone for 20 minutes , said @entity3 told him he wants to travel to the @entity8 for study , senior @entity8 officials said			1
the @entity8 officials said that as long as @entity3 has a legitimate offer from an accredited institution and is serious about studying in the @entity8 , he would be given a student visa			1
" we believe steps will play out expeditiously , " one @entity8 official said			2
the news that embassy staff had an opportunity to meet with @entity3 underscores the progress in the case			1
@entity3 had said early friday that @entity8 @entity14 officials had told him @entity6 security personnel stopped @entity8 diplomats from entering his hospital room thursday			1
he is in a @entity0 hospital for treatment of a foot injury suffered during his escape			0
but the embassy staff and doctor met with @entity3 at the hospital for 45 minutes , the senior @entity8 officials said			1
friday was the 10th birthday of @entity3 's son , and embassy staff brought him presents			2
@entity104 's long - planned visit to @entity0 for strategic and economic talks became dominated by a flurry of negotiations between @entity6 and @entity8 officials over the @entity3 case			1
the diplomatic headache came just months before a presidential election in the @entity8 and a once - in - a - decade change of leadership in @entity6			1
the uproar prompted sharp @entity116 criticism of the @entity118 administration as soft on autocratic governments that abuse their citizens , and it has touched a nerve politically			0
in one remarkable development , @entity3 called into a congressional hearing thursday chaired by @entity125 rep. @entity125 of @entity126			2
" @entity6 pledged to guarantee my constitutional rights and called me a free man , " @entity3 said , speaking from his hospital room early friday in @entity0 to congressional commission members who listened by speakerphone in @entity130 , 12 times zones and thousands of miles away			1
" i want them to keep their commitment by allowing me to travel abroad to recuperate , " he said			0
" i want to go to the @entity8 and rest for a while , since i have n't had a sunday in seven years			0
" the @entity6 comments came as @entity8 diplomats spoke with @entity3 in the hospital			1
the officials also met with @entity3 's wife , @entity142 , according to a senior @entity62 official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter			0
@entity104 was due to leave @entity6 on saturday for @entity146			1

@entity3 , @entity152 rewriting @entity6 's script @entity3 said he was worried about his relatives in his hometown in the eastern province of @entity157 , which he fled last month			1
he said he has not been able to contact some of them and blamed local @entity6 officials for his living situation there			0
" they have installed seven surveillance cameras in my house , " he said			0
" in addition to have the guards stay in my place , they are building an electric fence around my house			0
they even scoffed , ' let 's see what this blind guy can do to us			0
' " in a telephone interview with @entity1 , @entity3 expressed optimism that @entity8 officials would act on his behalf			1
" i believe they will help me , " he said			0
until last month , @entity3 had been forcibly confined to his home for 18 months after serving four years in prison , apparently over his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices such as forced abortions and sterilizations by @entity6 's family planning officials			2
when @entity3 left the embassy , @entity8 officials announced that they had worked out a deal with @entity6 for his future and that @entity3 was leaving of his own free will			1
the officials said the @entity6 government had committed to relocate @entity3 to a " safe environment " away from the province where he and his family say they had suffered brutal treatment by local authorities			2
in addition , the officials said , @entity6 agreed to investigate those allegations of mistreatment and promised @entity3 would face no further legal issues			2
under the agreement , @entity3 was to be granted the opportunity to pursue university studies in the safe location			0
@entity77 said one of the proposals " allowed for the possible transfer some day to an @entity8 college or university			0
" but @entity3 subsequently indicated he regretted having abandoned the embassy and made pleas through @entity1 and other international news organizations to @entity8 leaders to get him out of @entity6			1
his statements prompted bewildered reactions from @entity8 officials , who reiterated that the decision to leave the embassy was @entity3 's and that he had repeatedly said he wished to remain in @entity6			1
did @entity118 betray a @entity6 hero ? on friday , @entity3 mollified his tone compared with the comments he made a day earlier , when he said he was " very disappointed " in the @entity8 government because he felt @entity8 officials had lobbied for him to leave the embassy and abandoned him at the hospital			1
instead , he expressed " deep gratitude " to @entity8 officials in @entity0 for having treated him " extremely well " during his six - day stay in the embassy			0
@entity231 , an @entity8 law professor and friend of @entity3 , offered an explanation for @entity3 's statements after he left the embassy			1
" everything changed when he got to the hospital , " said @entity231 , who advised @entity3 by phone while he was inside the embassy			0
" all of a sudden , the people who had worked so hard to secure his future from our embassy and our @entity62 , they were tired as can be and they went home to sleep			0
" @entity3 is " in a very fragile emotional state , " @entity231 said			0
" you have to understand the enormous pressures in which he 's been living and recently operating			0
and it got to be too much			0
" @entity3 's case has touched a nerve in @entity6			2
comments from @entity6 officials reported by state media have criticized what they call " interference " by @entity130			0
@entity231 said he is hopeful a deal can be reached to get @entity3 out of @entity6			2
" they 're practical people , " he said , referring to @entity6 's leaders			0
" they 're going to want to get rid of him and his family in the most humane appearance possible			0
" human rights advocacy groups , meanwhile , questioned whether @entity0 would stick to its promises about @entity3 's future , noting that several of his friends and family members have been detained or are unaccounted for			0
