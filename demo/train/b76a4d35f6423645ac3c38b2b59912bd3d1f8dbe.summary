-- president @entity1 returned to @entity2 on wednesday and plunged into a newly energized political debate over how to shrink the chronic federal deficit and debt in the wake of his stronger - than - expected re-election victory			1
tuesday 's election results effectively preserved the political status quo , with @entity1 winning a second term and @entity12 holding their majority in the @entity14 while @entity15 keeping control of the @entity17			1
the looming question was whether freedom from having to face the voters again would prompt @entity1 to push harder for a compromise that might anger core liberal supporters			1
at the same time , republicans stung by their defeat in the presidential race and their inability to seize the @entity17 faced pressure from inside and outside the party to soften their fierce partisanship and adopt more moderate positions that might bring about agreement on tough issues			2
@entity1 makes history again the nation faces a " fiscal cliff " -- a combination of expiring tax cuts and required , across - the - board spending reductions set to occur at the end of the year absent a congressional deal to avert it			1
economists warn that allowing the full impact of the fiscal cliff to occur would further slow an already sluggish recovery , while failure to address the deficit issue in a comprehensive way could bring another downgrade of the @entity14 credit rating			0
posturing by both sides on wednesday professed a conciliatory approach but offered little movement from hardline positions that have stymied past negotiations on a broad deficit reduction deal			0
a @entity57 statement said @entity1 launched the discussion on arguably the most pressing challenge facing his administration by phoning key congressional leaders wednesday , including the top @entity12 in both the @entity57 and @entity17			1
@entity1 " reiterated his commitment to finding bipartisan solutions to : reduce our deficit in a balanced way , cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses and create jobs , " the statement said			1
world worries as @entity14 fiscal cliff looms " the president said he believed that the @entity77 people sent a message in yesterday 's election that leaders in both parties need to put aside their partisan interests and work with common purpose to put the interests of the @entity77 people and the @entity77 economy first , " it continued			2
one of those who spoke with the president , house speaker @entity88 , issued his own statement later wednesday			1
in it , he challenged @entity1 to work with @entity12 on negotiating a comprehensive plan to reduce spending , lower tax rates while eliminating tax loopholes , and reform entitlement programs such as @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98			1
" we want you to lead , not as a liberal or a conservative , but as @entity103 , " said @entity88 , @entity102			1
" we want you to succeed			0
let 's challenge ourselves to find the common ground that has eluded us			0
let 's rise above the dysfunction and do the right thing together for our country			0
" however , @entity88 specifically opposed a core @entity1 tax proposal that was a major theme of his election campaign -- restoring higher tax rates from the 1990s on individuals who make more than $ 250,000			1
the conservative @entity88 also made clear that @entity1 and the nation should drop any thought of reaching a comprehensive agreement in coming weeks , and he called instead for laying the foundation for difficult but necessary negotiations next year when the new @entity119 starts work			1
" we wo n't solve the problem of our fiscal unbalance overnight and certainly wo n't do it in a lame duck session of @entity119 , " @entity88 said			1
" and it wo n't be solved simply by raising taxes or taking a plunge off the fiscal cliff			0
" opinion : five things @entity1 must do @entity1 's election victory in a campaign based in part on his call for wealthy @entity77 to contribute more to reduce the federal deficit gives him a negotiating advantage over @entity88 , analysts said			1
@entity88 was " trying to do the best he can with a very weak hand , " said @entity0 contributor @entity138			1
conservatives seek to shrink the size of government and therefore oppose additional revenue from taxes			0
@entity88 tried to sound willing to compromise on wednesday by saying he 'd be open to a comprehensive plan resulting in more revenue , but not from higher taxes			1
he offered a similar proposal to vanquished @entity12 presidential candidate @entity150 , who argued during the campaign for tax reform that lowered rates for everyone and eliminated some loopholes and deductions to promote economic growth that mean more government revenue			2
meanwhile , senate majority leader @entity159 , @entity160 , said wednesday that the election results showed that most @entity77 want the wealthy to pay a larger share toward resolving the nation 's fiscal problems			0
" it is better to dance than to fight			0
it is better to work together , " @entity159 told a news conference			0
" everything does n't have to be a fight			0
that is the way it 's been the last couple of years			0
everyone should comprehend , especially my @entity17 friends , that legislation is the art of compromise			2
" analysis : @entity1 won with a better ground game on tuesday night , @entity1 told euphoric supporters in @entity184 that " you voted for action , not politics as usual			2
" @entity150 , absorbing defeat after a historically expensive race on both sides , issued a similar call in his concession speech			0
" the nation , as you know , is at a critical point , " he said			0
" at a time like this , we ca n't risk partisan bickering and political posturing			0
our leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the people 's work			2
" former president @entity205 predicted weeks ago that an @entity1 victory would be the key to ending the gridlock in @entity2			1
every administration needs " an action - forcing event , " he told @entity0 , adding : " i believe the election will be that event			0
i expect the president to win			2
and i think if he does , after this happens , then you will see the logjam begin to break			2
" @entity12 strategist @entity219 , a @entity0 contributor , echoed that message wednesday			0
" president @entity1 's re-election does two things			1
it frees president @entity1 to be able to work with the @entity119 , and it frees the @entity119 to be able to work with president @entity1 , " @entity225 said			2
@entity228 mayor @entity227 summed it up succinctly			0
" the election is over			0
it 's time for governing and making things happen , " he told @entity0			0
that means bringing @entity1 's signature campaign word -- " forward " -- to fruition			1
" tonight , more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny , " the president said in his victory speech early wednesday , " the task of perfecting our union moves forward			2
" how @entity1 's data crunchers helped him win			1

new : house speaker @entity88 challenges @entity1 on tax and entitlement reforms
new : @entity1 talks by phone with congressional leaders on moving forward
with re-election , @entity1 free from having to face voters again ; will that lead to compromise ?
@entity205 had said an @entity1 win could be key to ending the @entity2 logjam
