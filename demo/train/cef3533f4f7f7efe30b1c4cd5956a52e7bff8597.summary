@entity0 -- modern @entity3 football has become almost synonymous with precocious millionaire players who lead lavish " bling " lifestyles and attract wages that would make even @entity9 bankers blush			1
but there was a time when soccer was a career driven more by love than financial reward			0
rewind to 1961 and salaries for even the most famous footballers were low , as the @entity19 game was constricted by a law that limited the weekly wage to a maximum of just $ 31 ( £ 20 )			1
it is 50 years since @entity24 -- a dashing midfielder for first division side @entity25 and the head of the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) -- won his fight against what he perceived as an " injustice			0
" and when he successfully convinced the @entity35 @entity34 to scrap the cap , it would change the footballing landscape for ever			0
his victory saw the @entity19 league go on to pioneer an approach that harnessed aggressive global marketing to prompt skyrocketing revenue and , in turn , an explosion in players ' wages			1
soon after the ruling @entity24 's team - mate @entity47 became the first ever £ 100 - a - week player			0
his chairman @entity49 said at the time : " @entity47 is a top entertainer and will be paid as one from now on			1
" it was such a large sum that @entity47 ' pay packet was twice the size of a cabinet minister and was even discussed in the @entity56			0
wages rose steadily through the century but it was the creation of the @entity59 in 1992 and the resulting cash boom that prompted an unprecedented spike in salaries			1
clubs enjoyed bountiful revenues from lucrative television and sponsorship deals allowing players to cash in			0
other leagues in @entity69 quickly followed suit			1
the overseas broadcasting rights for 2010 - 13 alone netted the @entity59 $ 2.2bn , while the winners of the @entity73 , which was also revamped in 1992 , can claim up to $ 46 million			2
as prize money climbed clubs spent huge amounts chasing success , with most of their income going straight back out on spiraling wages			0
nowadays , the @entity19 game 's highest paid player is said to be @entity84 striker @entity83 , who pockets around $ 450,000 - a - week from @entity85 , according to the @entity86 , while @entity87 of @entity88 came top of @entity91 's 2009 rich list , making $ 47 million in salary and endorsements			1
however , despite the game being richer than ever before , more than half of @entity69 's top clubs recorded a loss in 2009 with some even spending 100 % of their income on salaries alone			1
and even though football proved relatively immune to the recent global downturn , losses are rising , @entity85 posting a $ 148 million deficit in 2009			1
but could this era of huge player wages be about to end ? the game 's @entity3 governing body , @entity69 , has long been concerned with cash - rich clubs like @entity85 , @entity109 and @entity110 launching huge spending drives to snare a crop of the world 's best talent on mega salaries			1
now they are seeking to combat a rising sea of debt by introducing new regulations under the banner of " financial fair play			0
" the simple premise is that all @entity3 clubs must break even from the start of the 2012 - 13 season -- and will only be allowed to spend a certain percentage of their profits			0
any club falling outside the rules could be expelled from @entity3 competitions and cut off from lucrative revenue streams			2
the @entity59 's chief executive has called the rules a " ' soft salary cap " and is keen to make sure they do n't curb the ability to attract the best talent			1
@entity137 thinks @entity69 is " too sensible " to follow through on their threat of issuing bans			2
" it 's more about taking the steam out of the system and acting as a speed bump rather than about barring clubs , " he said			0
" no one in football is proud of the kind of wage inflation we 've experienced , but equally we must n't do anything that dampens the international appeal of our league			0
" according to @entity154 , professor of economics at @entity156 in @entity0 , the plans will not stem the rise and rise of players ' wages			2
he told @entity1 : " often it 's put to me that the bubble is about to burst and for 20 years i 've been saying ' no , there 's no reason for it to burst , ' and i still do n't see any reason			0
" the amount people are willing to pay depends on their income so if you expect economic growth in general to go on increasing i expect wages to generally go on increasing			0
" all the money that feeds into football clubs from fans paying to watch the games live or on television or through merchandise , feeds through to players ' salaries -- clubs just pass it on			1
" even returning @entity181 manager @entity180 has called today 's wage levels " astronomical " yet he believes most fans do n't begrudge players the vast sums they earn			2
though previous governments have expressed their concerns at wage levels , any attempt to reintroduce a wage cap , or a higher tax rate for players , would most likely end up in court , @entity154 says			0
despite several clubs sinking into administration very few go out of business and while fans often bemoan the gathering debts at their club , @entity154 says very few consider the alternative			2
he said : " if a football club is making money where would that money go ? well , it 's not going to be given back to fans that 's for sure			1
" i would have thought it 's much better to see the fans ' money going into buying players , paying wages and throwing the dice because sport is inherently a risky activity , it 's a gamble on success			1
" frankly , that 's what makes it attractive , so far from actually wanting this kind of @entity219 to come to an end , actually once clubs cease to take risks we would all find football rather dull and boring			2
" as for @entity24 , now 82 - years - old , his former club @entity225 are still $ 12,000 short of the $ 239,000 they need to build a statue of their ex-chairman outside their ground			2
perhaps the next time a player like @entity233 agrees a bumper new deal , he should consider making up the shortfall to honor the man who laid the foundations for his path to riches .			0
