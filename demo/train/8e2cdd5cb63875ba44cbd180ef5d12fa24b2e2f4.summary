@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 runs parallel to @entity5 , separated by several blocks			1
but the division runs much deeper			1
the two thoroughfares tell the story of two cities in one , of the gulf between class and race			0
some white residents told me they lived in a bubble : they own homes off @entity5 , eat in restaurants there and rarely venture into the streets that were familiar to @entity20 , the black teenager who was shot and killed by white police officer @entity21 on august 9			1
black residents who live in the patchwork of homes and apartments off @entity3 sounded a similar note			1
they , too , lived detached from other parts of @entity0			1
on monday , i walked both these @entity0 streets that have been unwittingly thrust into the news			1
i wanted to get a sense of the place , the people and the mood before a grand jury decides whether to indict @entity21			1
i also wanted to capture the contrast			0
@entity5 went through a revival , though signs of a city in decline still exist in the form of shuttered storefronts			1
there 's an upscale wine bar , bicycle shop , a brew house and a plaza for concerts			0
it 's walkable -- hence the district 's name , @entity51 -- and quaint			0
it 's a huge source of pride for @entity0			2
but after @entity20 's death , business owners on @entity5 have suffered			2
not as much as those on @entity3 , but they have lost money and are now fearful of what might happen after a grand jury decision is made public			1
complete coverage on @entity0 scroll through my @entity63 photos below to see the people and places of @entity0			2
first , @entity5 : @entity3 @entity3 intersects with @entity67 , where @entity20 was killed			1
a memorial was erected where his body lay on the street for four hours			0
@entity3 has been declining for many years , a victim of white flight from the area			2
the @entity74 was already looking into revamping @entity3 's commercial area and said in a study that it was not pedestrian - friendly or diverse			2
unlike @entity5 , there are no upscale restaurants here			1
there 's a @entity80 's and @entity82 fast food			0
there 's also a barbecue place that was very badly hit because of its location next to the @entity87 gas station , which became ground zero for violent protests and was burned down			0
police armed with tear gas confronted protesters on @entity3 in august			2
in the weeks since , many businesses had removed the plywood boards covering their doors and windows , but now they are back up again in expectation of more unrest			0
one place that has never been boarded up is the @entity100 & more			0
owner @entity101 puts his faith in @entity103 and in the community			0
he is confident he -- and @entity3 -- will be ok			0
read and see more about @entity3 : follow @entity2 's @entity105 on @entity106			0

two parallel roads in @entity0 are separated by several blocks , but the division runs deep
