@entity0 -- tuesday , for the first time , @entity2 was made available to the general public			1
as part of the one - day - only offering , anyone in the @entity8 could buy the $ 1,500 face - mounted computers and get a free pair of glass or sunglass frames			1
@entity13 is n't sharing any sales numbers for the day , so it 's difficult to divine how successful its first open - sales event has been			1
there were no reports of the @entity2 sales site crashing or customers being turned away			2
@entity13 did say it had sold out of the white , or " cotton " color of @entity2			1
as of tuesday afternoon there were still red , blue , gray and black options available			2
" wow , what a morning ! we 're happy to see so many new faces ( and frames ) in the @entity36 , " @entity13 posted tuesday to a @entity29 page , announcing the unavailability of the @entity32 model			1
the @entity36 refers to early testers of the @entity2 connected eyewear , which is expected to become widely available by the end of the year			0
early on wednesday @entity13 posted an update saying , " all spots in the @entity36 have been claimed for now , but if you missed it this time , do n't worry			1
we 'll be trying new ways to expand the @entity36 in the future			0
" a @entity13 spokesperson later said in a statement , " while you can still access the site , @entity2 will be marked as sold out			1
we are leaving the site open so @entity50 can still get any accessories they need			0
" the $ 1,500 headset was only available online , so there were no lines of buyers outside @entity13 buildings			1
there also did n't appear to be any organized protests of the sale , despite isolated assaults against @entity61 in this city amid recent tensions between longtime residents and a recent influx of tech - industry staffers			1
limited rollouts are a good way for @entity13 to test the demand for its much hyped wearable product			1
previously , the only people who could get @entity2 were developers or people who applied for the device through @entity13 contests			1
( the @entity77 - based company is no stranger to creating hype for a new product			2
when it first rolled out @entity81 10 years ago , the service was invite only , making it seem exclusive			0
) there are practical reasons @entity13 has drawn out the product 's launch			1
@entity2 is technically still in beta and it has been made significantly more consumer friendly since its launch a year ago			2
since then , the hardware has been updated and on - staff designers created a line of sleek glass frames that can hold prescription lenses			1
a day before opening up the online orders , @entity13 announced the latest round of software updates for @entity2 , which will roll out later this week			1
the upgrade is expected to improve the device 's battery life and make future software updates easier			0
there are minor tweaks related to photo sharing , submitting feedback to @entity13 and voice commands			1
in response to dissatisfaction with the quality of video calls on @entity2 , @entity13 has removed that feature until it can be improved			1
@entity112 has wanted to buy @entity2 for a while but did n't pull the trigger until today			2
the @entity0 - based developer wants to wear the device while walking and running to get back into the habit of working out			2
he 's also interested in developing location - based games for @entity2 , inspired by augmented reality games like @entity121			0
" the annoying bit about designing games like this is having the user constantly looking down at their phone while trying to play the game in the real world , " said @entity112			0
on @entity134 , many of the people expressing excitement about their orders for @entity2 , appeared to work in the tech industry			0
but some were just regular folks who wanted to see the technology 's potential firsthand			0
@entity139 , a restaurant , hotel , and institutional management student in @entity143 , wants to find uses for @entity2 for students and travelers			0
" i will be on the spring 2015 voyage of @entity148 and i hope to help develop the traveling apps to help capture my semester abroad , " said @entity139			0
( she 's # teamshale			0
) @entity151 , a @entity2 customer who works for a rival company , thinks that the current price point is way too high			0
but that was n't going to stop him from ordering a pair			0
" i want to see how legit this is			0
what can it do , " said @entity151			0
" it seems like the future , but how close is it ? " there 's also no way to tell if enthusiasm for @entity2 has been subdued by recent attacks on people wearing @entity2 in public or backlash over privacy concerns			2
some fans might have decided to save their money and wait until @entity13 releases the next version of @entity2 , expected by the end of the year			2
the next version of @entity2 will likely sport a reduced price tag .			0

the $ 1,500 devices were only available for one - day to people in the @entity8
