-- the @entity1 has suspended all fraternity activities until january 2015 while authorities investigate allegations of sexual assault made against members of a prominent fraternity house there			1
as the father of two young girls who will someday be college women , my heart goes out to any student harmed by sexual assault			1
there is no place on any campus or anywhere for such behavior , and students need protection from criminals			2
and as president and chief executive of the @entity23 , i am eager to work with administrators at @entity25 and other campuses to take on this challenge			2
from both perspectives , i urge college administrators to act responsibly			2
we can not solve this terrible problem by punishing all fraternities and fraternity members for the deplorable actions of a few			1
by all means , schools should investigate every allegation and hold students accountable for their actions			1
they should seek criminal charges against those who break the law and suspend or expel those who violate university policy			1
but they should not violate the rights of those who live by the rules simply because they are in some way affiliated with those who do not			1
the vast majority of fraternity and sorority members join them for all the right reasons			1
they are looking for a place to belong			0
they want to learn and apply leadership skills			0
they seek an outlet where they can give back to their communities			0
they want to enrich their collegiate experience			0
to take all of this away from so many good kids simply because a few kids choose to be bad is unfair , misguided and short - sighted			0
when fraternity is done right , i firmly believe it is one of the best facets of college life			1
my own fraternity experience enabled me to grow into a man , excel in school and better understand the value of community			2
i became a better person when i joined , and in my current role , i aspire to help other young men become better people			2
the @entity23 stands ready to participate in a productive discussion			0
this is why i formed three commissions this year to study the most vexing problems facing colleges today : sexual assault , alcohol abuse and hazing			1
over the next 18 months , these panels will come up with meaningful recommendations to address each problem			0
i will share these recommendations with university administrators and @entity23 members alike , with the explicit goal of overcoming these issues in the years ahead			0
the developments at @entity25 and other campuses are alarming			0
i hope we can galvanize now to find solutions soon			0
at the same time , i am committed to protecting the fraternity movement , so that all students who choose to join a fraternity can join one -- and experience membership in the way it was intended .			1

@entity112 : @entity1 suspended fraternities till january after rape allegations
he says his heart goes out to sexual assault *victims* , but closing fraternities is no solution
schools must hold *assailants* accountable , nor violate rights of those who follow rules , he says
@entity112 : most fraternity men join for right reasons . punish rape , but be fair to fraternities
