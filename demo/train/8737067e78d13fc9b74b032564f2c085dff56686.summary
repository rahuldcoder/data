@entity1 , @entity0 -- you can almost picture it now : @entity5 swallowed up by a tight - fitting futuristic designer space suit -- one hand waving at the on - flight camera , the other clasping a @entity10 " space traveler " handbag			1
tighter fit : @entity13 of @entity14 researchers are working on a new , sleeker space suit			2
oh yes , with the age of space tourism upon us , space fashion looks set to become the next step into this infinite world of adventure			1
one factor certain to drive the fashion - crazy towards space concepts is the super-wealthy space tourists ( reportedly paying a minimum price of $ 200,000 per seat ) who are set to make trips into orbit an everyday occurrence for those with deep pockets			2
and space - inspired fashion is already making cosmic waves in the design world			1
earlier this year a space fashion show was held in @entity38 , @entity39 and featured at the @entity41 2008 exhibition			1
last year @entity42 held an exhibition at the @entity44 in @entity45 titled " @entity46 " which included an installation by legendary @entity49 designer @entity48			0
that show followed two international space fashion shows in @entity39 and the @entity52 @entity53 , president and founder of @entity55 , one of the organizations actively involved in the world of apparel for the final frontier , said space fashion is more than just a fad			1
" space fashion is important and will be in the next generation of space suits			1
i do n't know how much we will see at the beginning because simpler versions of space attire are going to be what people are interested in , " he said			0
" but there will be some sense of fashion involved			2
i would like something futuristic if i was going up into space			0
" @entity53 said the organizer of the space fashion shows , @entity78 , had gone to great lengths to prepare the shows , and they had attracted massive amounts of interest			1
forecasting that space travelers would soon become fashion - conscious , @entity53 likened the situation to the beginnings of commercial air travel			1
" women had certain dresses and jackets to wear just for flying in the airplane			0
back then it was this brand new experience and you had to dress for it			0
" and there is no doubt space fashion is being taken seriously			1
@entity55 and a similar company called @entity100 are looking at forming a space fashion organization with other partners , while the @entity103 ( @entity103 ) is looking at a new slim - fit space suit			1
@entity105 also is looking to design a new " @entity107 " suit especially for space travelers			1
@entity53 said the space fashion shows were important for a variety of reasons			1
" the event got people to start thinking about space tourism			0
the whole reason behind the show was to get people thinking about it and make it something that everyone can participate in			0
" while space travel may be inaccessible to many , a fashion show is something the average person can participate in , he said			2
the shows had produced a variety of results , @entity53 said			0
" some of those i can see being worn in space , but others just were n't practical			0
some of the bigger gowns were ' space - inspired fashion , ' but people need to be comfortable and free in space , so i 'm not sure they would work			1
" so where will the line between fashion and practicality fall ? @entity142 of @entity52 space suit designers @entity141 felt there would be a move towards fashion - oriented space suit design in the next few years			1
" i think we will see a move towards thinking about the fashion side of things , but at the same time people still want something that works , " he said			0
" at the end of the day it 's survival equipment , so how can you make that look good ? you just do the best you can			0
" a company related to @entity141 , @entity159 , has made space suits for many major space - related movies , including " @entity162 " and " @entity163			1
" " if you name the space film , we have probably made the suits for it , " @entity142 said , reeling off a list			2
he felt the focus of space fashion will become more concentrated on real space hardware , rather than just space - inspired fashion			1
in terms of design changes , @entity142 said a move towards a slimmer suit was inevitable			0
" what we have started doing is making them less baggy when they 're not in use			0
" however , with standard suits designed using " mechanical counter-pressure , " where the wearer was literally in a bag full of gas , @entity142 was still unsure about how the @entity103 technology would develop			2
" @entity103 's suit uses the material to push on you			2
that works well for the arms and legs , but wherever you have non-uniform parts of the body , it 's not so good , " he said			0
he said there were some production issues facing all space suit - making projects			2
" the technology is not so hard , it 's how to make lots of them and how to make them more cheaply			0
" still , @entity142 was confident that more space travelers would mean more demand , more companies , more technological breakthroughs and eventually more fashionable suits .			0

@entity105 , @entity141 and @entity103 all involved in designing new space suits
experts believe space - suit design will become more fashion conscious
