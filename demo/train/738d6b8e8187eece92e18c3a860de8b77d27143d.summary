-- summer is inching upon us , and that means kids at public pools will be splashing , barbecues in the backyard will be blazing and a slate of blockbusters will start crowding around " @entity10 " at cineplexes			0
while all this is going on , one song will be blaring from car radios , tinny laptop speakers and hot dog stands at the beach			2
and that tune will be deemed the song of the summer			1
of course , each year around this time , anyone with fingers and a @entity23 account -- let alone a published byline -- is eager to latch onto a budding chart hit and declare that , yes , this one particular three - minute confection of perfection is definitely going to be the song of the summer			1
and if , by chance , that song still happens to be heavily crackling across the airwaves at an hourly rate in august , well , good for those pop prophets			0
but let 's just state the obvious : pop does have a way of weaving itself into the fabric of our summer experiences			2
( think of these recent , inescapable scorchers : @entity46 's " @entity45 " and " @entity47 " in 2008 and 2010 , respectively , the @entity48 ' " @entity43 " in 2009 and @entity50 's " @entity49 " last year			0
) so why , then , does n't anyone ever focus on the big hits that come along in december , or , for that matter , february ? is there some law that decrees june , july and august are the only zeitgeist - approved months on the calendar ? well , no. but song of the winter just does n't have the same sexy ring to it , and who wants to cruise around sleeveless with the windows down when it 's 24 degrees outside anyway ? that brings us to 2012 's upcoming stretch of sunny days , and @entity71			1
many sites will inform you that the 26 - year - old @entity76 's bouncy , string - laden " @entity74 " is a song of the summer shoe - in ( or , at the very least , one of the top contenders )			1
and almost like clockwork , the single has inched up to no. 2 on the @entity83 , just as @entity86 's six - week reign on top with " @entity84 " seems to be winding down			2
not up on @entity71 or " @entity74 " ? you 've been living under a rock , we see			1
below are the only three points you 'll need to know : her first big break : @entity94 , @entity95 , brunette placed third on " @entity96 " in 2007			0
her first album , " @entity98 , " was released in her home country the following year , and her ep " @entity101 " arrived this past february on @entity102			0
how she blew up : fellow @entity76 @entity103 and his manager , @entity104 , signed @entity71 earlier this year to a deal with their @entity107 label			0
" @entity74 " : as the legend goes , @entity103 and girlfriend @entity108 heard the song on the radio while visiting @entity76 in january			2
an alternate music video for " @entity74 " ( different from the official clip ) features @entity103 and @entity114 , as well as pals @entity115 and members of @entity118 , lip - syncing along with the track			2
the vid went viral , and has more than 74 million views			0
to date , the single has topped the charts in @entity76 , @entity125 and the @entity126 , and gone @entity127 in over a dozen other countries			0
it 's worth pointing out that while there has been lots of speculation that it could be the " perfect pop song , " @entity71 's breakout hit has been breaking out for quite some time now			1
it was first released in september , and by april it had become a radio staple here in the @entity138			0
but with june looming in the distance , it 's tricky to peg this slice of disco - pop that 's been around for eight months as the definitive song of summer 2012			1
for starters , @entity71 has some stiff competition in the forms of her pal @entity103 's @entity148 - like single " boyfriend " , @entity151 's ode to antiquated communication methods " payphone , " @entity154 's similarly upbeat stomper " @entity155 " and @entity156 's " @entity157 " soundtrack jam " back in @entity159			1
" she also faces peaking early in the summer with " @entity74 , " then having it slide away by the time fireworks start shooting off , in the wake of other new tracks that will catch the ears of @entity166 - clicking tweens			1
last summer , for instance , @entity151 and @entity167 's " @entity169 " did n't come along until late june			0
by august , " @entity172 " coaches ' pair - up was unavoidable on radio , and it went on to spend four weeks atop the @entity83			0
but it 's late may , and right now you probably just want to know whether or not " @entity74 " is going to be the hands - down song of summer 2012			1
we 'll certainly concede that it was the song of spring			1
as for summer ? we 'll say definitely ... maybe			0

one song will soon be blaring in the *background* , and that tune will be the song of the summer
many sites will inform you that @entity71 's " @entity74 " is a shoe - in
we 'll certainly concede that it was the song of the spring
