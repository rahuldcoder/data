as the opening of next month 's @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , approaches , the controversies surrounding the games seem to accumulate by the day			1
these have included criticism of @entity5 's human rights record , particularly its treatment of homosexuals , its environmental policies and , with the recent suicide bombings in @entity14 , its anti-terrorism actions and strategy in the @entity17			0
calls to boycott the games and other international pressure have led @entity5 to release high - profile dissidents including @entity22 , the ex-oil tycoon , and members of the punk band @entity25			0
yet for all the heat generated in these controversies , one of the most significant issues of all surrounding the @entity3 has been nearly ignored : recognition of the indigenous people of @entity4 , the @entity31			1
the @entity31 , who are mostly @entity33 , resided in @entity4 for millennia			1
in the 19th century , an expanding @entity35 coveted their territory -- which is south and east of @entity5 proper -- and used overwhelming force to defeat them			1
@entity5 killed around 1.5 million @entity31 and expelled a similar number , mostly to the @entity40 , with many dying of famine and disease			1
entire tribes were decimated ; for example , the @entity46 tribe was reduced from 300,000 to 3,000 people			0
the bloodiest battle of all , which @entity31 refer to as their " last stand , " occurred in the vicinity of @entity4 , the @entity31 capital , in 1864			1
the @entity31 describe the catastrophe that befell their people as the first modern genocide			0
the few @entity31 able to remain in the @entity17 found themselves a minority in their own land , which was quickly settled by @entity5			2
those who were expelled or escaped were forced to migrate from country to country in search of safety and stability			0
@entity64 @entity31 have faced huge challenges in attempting to preserve their identity and traditions and keep the memory of their homeland alive			0
when it was announced that @entity4 would host the @entity72 , there was an outcry among @entity31 , who were profoundly insulted that the games would be staged on the graves of their ancestors , almost exactly 150 years after the @entity4 " last stand			1
" @entity31 launched global campaigns of protest amidst reports of human remains being discovered at @entity84 construction sites			2
the @entity31 complained of intimidation by the @entity5 , who , for example , last month arrested eight prominent @entity31 activists in the @entity17 , all of whom were respected public figures			2
the @entity31 found it intolerable not only that @entity4 was selected to host the @entity3 , but also that @entity5 did not seem to acknowledge that @entity31 even lived there			1
when president @entity93 delivered his bid for the games in a speech to the @entity97 in 2007 , he said that the @entity4 area used to be inhabited by ancient @entity99 and did not mention the @entity31			1
this is noteworthy because not only did the @entity31 live in the region at the time of the @entity99 and maintain close ties with them , but they actually participated in the original olympic games			0
@entity5 's indifference towards its indigenous people sharply contrasts with @entity108 's policy at the last @entity3 in @entity109 in 2010			1
then , for the first time in history , the native peoples of the area were made official hosts of the @entity3 and were involved in every aspect of the games			2
a depiction of an inukshuk , an indigenous landmark and symbol , was featured as the official logo of the @entity3			0
the governments of @entity108 and @entity123 contributed millions of dollars to centers that educated visitors about indigenous culture and history			0
other recent @entity3 , for example in @entity128 in 2002 , also prominently featured the native peoples of that area			0
despite @entity5 's failures on the @entity31 issue , @entity93 still has time to act			1
he has already taken the crucial step of allowing protests at the @entity3 , and protesters , circassian and otherwise , must be allowed to freely express themselves to the world 's media			2
@entity93 can also push for an acknowledgement of the @entity31 at the opening ceremony and speak on the issue			2
a serious and sincere acknowledgment of the @entity31 would help demonstrate to the world that @entity93 is serious about his vision of a modern and multiethnic " new @entity5			1
" the @entity143 and @entity144 have officially apologized for the horrors they inflicted on indigenous peoples , and by taking positive action at the @entity72 , @entity5 can move in a similar direction			0
perhaps such a gesture of respect could help the nation find a solution to the festering problem of the @entity17 , where areas to the east of @entity4 , such as @entity156 and @entity157 , remain in a state of war and hopelessness			0
it is impossible to bring back the mass numbers of @entity31 killed at @entity4 and the surrounding region in the 19th century			1
what @entity5 , and all of us , can do is remember and honor them			0
by doing so , we affirm the important role that indigenous peoples must play in the 21st century , and also help ensure that the destruction of an entire people never happens again .			0

@entity170 : @entity4 's indigenous people largely ignored in run - up to @entity3
@entity93 's talk of @entity4 's history leaves out @entity31 , purged by @entity5 in 19th century
he notes outcry from circassian *diaspora* over @entity179 being sited on graves of *forebears*
@entity170 : other @entity84 hosts have recognized indigenous people ; @entity5 can still do this
