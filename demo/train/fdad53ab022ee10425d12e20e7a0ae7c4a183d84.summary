the @entity0 has promised to supply weapons , communications equipment and training to rebels in @entity5 so they can help battle the @entity6 in @entity7 and @entity5 ( @entity8			1
) now comes the hard part : identifying " acceptable " groups able and willing to take the fight to @entity8			2
the security landscape in @entity5 changes daily			1
alliances and priorities among the many rebel groups shift , fortunes ebb and flow			2
and the hard truth is that none of them appears able to uproot @entity8 from its strongholds in north - eastern @entity5			1
@entity21 , a veteran @entity5 - watcher and associate professor at the @entity23 , says the situation inside @entity5 is more fluid and unpredictable than ever , with rebel groups confused about @entity0 intentions and knocked sideways by @entity8 ' ruthless advance			1
@entity21 says president @entity28 is the reluctant warrior -- forced by domestic politics and the outrage over the beheading of two @entity0 by @entity8 to pledge not just to degrade but to destroy @entity8			1
that means going after its @entity5 heartland -- and without @entity0 " boots on the ground " mobilizing @entity5 rebel groups to help			1
but as the president admitted last month to the @entity39 when talking about moderate @entity5 groups : " there 's not as much capacity as you would hope			1
" @entity45 spokesman @entity44 has tried to put a more optimistic spin on the situation , asserting last week that " over the course of the last three years , the @entity0 has gotten much greater clarity about which individuals in the region we can rely on and count on and work with , and which individuals , frankly , that we ca n't			1
" many moderate factions have been squeezed out or self - destructed in a morass of corruption , incompetence and dissent			0
a columnist for @entity61 who writes from @entity63 under the pseudonym @entity65 says " the stigma of corruption and ineptitude permeates most of the @entity5 rebel factions designated as ' moderates , ' and some have even been involved outright in serious war crimes			1
" that corruption and incompetence have eased @entity8 ' path among civilians in some areas -- as it has delivered security , fuel and bread -- and led some fighters of the @entity82 ( @entity84 's preferred partner ) to migrate to @entity86 groups			2
writing on the @entity21 , @entity87 says he found a consensus among @entity5 refugees he met in @entity90 : that the @entity82 was " scattered , under - resourced , devoid of unity â€” and increasingly , bit players in a drama between two unthinkable antagonists			1
" those antagonists are president @entity96 and @entity8			0
the twin threats from @entity8 and the @entity96 regime have made for a network of unlikely local alliances -- just to make the situation even more complicated			0
moderate groups have reached understandings with the @entity105 affiliate @entity106 and the radical @entity107			0
last week there were even reports of a brief truce between an @entity82 brigade and @entity8 near @entity112 in an effort to stave off regime advances			0
that makes the illicit transfer of weapons and men more likely			0
what 's more , some senior figures among rebel groups say they will use the training and equipment they get against the @entity96 regime before they turn it on @entity8			2
the founder of the @entity82 , colonel @entity125 , said his forces would n't battle @entity8 until he had assurances of western help to oust the regime			0
but that would draw the @entity0 and its allies deeper into a civil war which they see as an unwinnable quagmire			1
one man who might benefit from @entity84 's new plan is @entity137 , commander of the @entity138 , which was formed to oppose @entity8 in northern @entity5			1
this month , @entity137 has committed substantial manpower to confronting @entity8 in the @entity63 countryside			0
he has proved a capable commander but the number of fighters he can command is variously estimated at between 6,000 and 25,000			0
and many analysts regard @entity137 as an opportunist			2
he has been open about fighting alongside @entity105 affiliate @entity106 as circumstances have demanded , telling the @entity149 newspaper the @entity148 in april : " it 's clear that i 'm not fighting against @entity105			2
this is a problem outside of @entity5 's border , so it 's not our problem			1
" there is also the issue of ' life expectancy ' among rebel leaders			0
@entity137 claimed last week he had escaped assassination attempts by both the regime and @entity8 , one of which killed his daughter			0
until recently @entity165 -- an @entity86 group focused on the battle against @entity96 and hostile to @entity8 -- was one of the most effective rebel factions			0
then a mysterious explosion in the city of @entity171 earlier this month killed its leader , @entity172 , and most its senior officials			0
some sources blamed the regime ; others @entity8 , which has in the past targeted the leaders of rival groups			0
@entity21 says @entity180 was a wily operator and a " super-leader " among @entity5 rebel factions , and the group 's future is very much open to question			1
@entity187 of the @entity188 summed up the scale of the loss			0
@entity165 has been " the missing link between radical @entity193 - jihadism and the type of mainstream and @entity5 nationalism - infused @entity196 that @entity199 and @entity200 state powers preferred to work with -- a powerful " swing voter " in the struggle over the ideological direction of @entity5 's insurgency			1
" counter-balance to @entity8 there are also grave doubts over the future of @entity105 's affiliate @entity106 , which until last year was arguably the @entity96 regime 's most capable opponent			2
@entity21 says @entity8 has made @entity106 " look just like any other militia , " driving it out of @entity213 in eastern @entity5 and @entity63			1
it has also been riven by internal dissent			0
@entity106 is still a serious player in many theaters -- especially the south and in the province of @entity171 , but @entity187 says one @entity106 commander has allegedly admitted that " in several provinces , his organization is in an advanced stage of decay due to defections , financial difficulties , and flagging morale " as fighters have tired of the fratricidal war against @entity8			0
normally this would be good news for the @entity0 and its western allies , but in the short - term at least @entity106 's survival provides an important counter-balance to @entity8			1
@entity21 says it could bounce back quickly " if @entity8 is whacked " by the @entity0 -- but that 's unlikely to be the desired consequence			1
over the past few days , @entity8 has again shown its resilience and reach			0
it has mounted complex suicide attacks in @entity240 , continued to keep up the pressure on beleaguered rebel groups in @entity63 and embarked on a lightning offensive against @entity245 areas in @entity5 --- driving as many as 130,000 people across the border into @entity248			1
the @entity249 had been more successful than most groups in resisting @entity8 in @entity5			1
in recent weeks , the @entity251 -- @entity252 -- had begun co-operating with other rebel groups in the face of the common threat from @entity8 , forming a joint operations room and claiming responsibility for attacks on @entity8 , according to @entity259 at the @entity260			0
that may have prompted the @entity8 onslaught ; now those @entity249 left in northern @entity5 are fighting for their survival			2
and they will get no help from the @entity0 or @entity248 , says @entity21 , because of their close relationship with @entity248 brethren in the @entity267 -- which is regarded as a terrorist group in @entity84 and @entity269			2
surveying this grim landscape , one could be excused for wondering how vetting and training rebel fighters -- 5,000 to start with -- can turn the tide			0
@entity21 says 5,000 -- properly armed , disciplined and provided with intelligence could dent either @entity8 or the @entity96 regime			0
" @entity96 is very weak , after four years of war , " he says , " but at the moment the others are all weaker			0
" the rosiest scenario , says @entity21 , sees moderate @entity281 groups eventually carving out a state in northern @entity5 , expelling @entity8 in the process , while the regime holds onto @entity112 and a swathe of the coast around @entity287			2
but @entity5 has a habit of confounding all but the grimmest of scenarios , and @entity21 acknowledges that " perpetual anarchy " seems more likely			1
there is another pitfall in fuelling the conflict with more weapons : escalating fighting could drive even more @entity5 across the border , further destabilizing @entity90 , @entity298 and @entity248			2
the @entity0 has consistently sought to contain the @entity5 conflict ; @entity8 would like nothing better than to export it .			1

@entity0 has promised to supply and train " acceptable " rebels in @entity5
at best , analysts say the plan could *cement* @entity307 's grip on power
more likely is perpetual anarchy , escalation in refugee crisis , *destabilization* and export of jihad
