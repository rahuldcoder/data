a new poll indicates that nearly half ( 48 % ) of @entity15 residents think it 's " kind of cool " that their governor is a superfan of @entity14			1

another 33 % say it 's neither cool nor embarrassing , or they simply do n't have an opinion			2
breaking the numbers down by political parties , roughly half of @entity34 , @entity35 and independents respect @entity13 's image as a @entity14 fanatic			1
" democrats and @entity34 may have very different views of the governor 's job performance , but one area where @entity13 has fostered unabashed bipartisan support is his idolization of @entity14 , " said @entity41 , director of the @entity42 , in a release about the poll			1
it 's no surprise that @entity15 has @entity14 pride			1

the governor unleashed on one woman last month who said @entity14 , a liberal , had called on the @entity34 governor to stop playing his music at events			1
" you 're wrong , " he flatly told her at a town hall meeting , as they continued to argue			0
while @entity14 and @entity13 have met a couple of times and @entity14 praised @entity13 for his leadership after @entity83 , @entity14 has done little else to show high regard for the governor			1
not long after the @entity87 scandal made national headlines in january , @entity14 took part in a parody with late night tv host @entity91 , mocking the governor in a song to the tune of " @entity95			0
" @entity13 not mad about @entity14 parody one @entity15 resident asked @entity13 to just give it up and destroy his @entity100 " he is not a friend of yours , governor , " the man said at a town hall in february			1
@entity13 acknowledged the man may be right but said it 's hard for him to let go of the musician he 's long adored			2
" hey listen , i do n't do drugs , i do n't drink			0
this is it for me , ok ? that 's all i 've got , " he said			0
the governor added he 's still holding out hope that one day the two will become friends			2
" i live in hope of that because i think when we get attached to certain people as youngsters , which i did , it is hard to kind of let that go , " he said			0

" the @entity27 poll was conducted by telephone with 802 @entity15 adults from september 17 - 21			2

@entity13 has been to 132 @entity14 concerts and holds out hope the two will be friends
@entity14 , a liberal , has never expressed the same kind of love toward @entity13
