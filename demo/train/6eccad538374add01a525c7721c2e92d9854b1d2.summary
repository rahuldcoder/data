-- he has a habit of producing the goods at the season 's finale , and 2014 was no different for @entity6 as he successfully defended his @entity7			1
coming into the tournament in @entity9 , @entity6 was still searching for his maiden win of the year , having suffered near misses at both the @entity12 and @entity13			1
a closing two - under - par 70 at @entity14 , however , ensured that the @entity15 not only ended that long wait , but it also provided him with a first title defense of his career			1
the 38 - year - old landed the @entity20 's @entity7 last year to help tie up the race to @entity9 , while also securing the @entity22 's own season - ending @entity7 which brought with it the @entity23			1
but while sunday 's victory was not enough to claim the race to @entity9 for a second year running -- @entity25 was confirmed as the winner earlier this month -- @entity6 was still able to prove once more that he is the man to come good at the year 's climax			1

it 's been close but eventually you get something if you stick around and i surely did that			0
" @entity6 had found himself in real trouble after the 11th hole sunday , having hit his tee shot out of bounds , enabling @entity43 's @entity42 to take a two - shot lead			2
the @entity15 fought back , though , and a superb tee shot on the 17th led to a tap - in birdie , allowing him to reclaim the lead			2
another birdie on the 18th ensured he finished two shots clear of @entity25 , @entity50 and @entity51 , who shared second spot			0
" it was hot out there and tricky on the back nine			0
i did not play my best and had a shocking hole on 11 , " @entity6 said			2
" i walked up to the tee with too much club in my hand and instead of changing i tried to cut a two - iron but hit a push , slice , shank straight into the buildings			0
" that knocked me back but i did not give up			0
i just had to dig in there and wait for something to happen			0
" sunday 's triumph is set to move @entity6 up to second in the world rankings behind @entity25 , who has enjoyed a season to remember			1
and looking ahead to 2015 , the @entity15 has set his sights on finally securing the elusive no. 1 berth , as well as landing a maiden major title			1
" it would be nice to have been ranked the world 's best at some point , " he said			0
