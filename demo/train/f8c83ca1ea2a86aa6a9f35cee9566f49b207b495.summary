-- " this can be yours , " the black - and - white newspaper advertisement promised above an image of a tree - lined ranch home in @entity4			1
at the bottom , it said " available to @entity9			2
" it was the 1950s in segregated @entity12 , @entity13 , and the promise of a slice of suburbia for black @entity17 lured hundreds to the new community			1
that included @entity20 , an @entity21 corporal who had been given a home loan for his military service through the @entity24			2
he and his wife , @entity25 , a schoolteacher at the time , purchased a two - story home in 1957 where they raised their four children			1
fifty years later , he was forced to evacuate that home as @entity31 bore down on @entity12 on august 29 , 2005			1
" my husband said , no , he was not leaving , because he was upstairs and if the water came , he 'd be upstairs , " @entity32 recalled			2
" i never would have left him			2
so my youngest son , he came and said , ' @entity36 , get in the car			2
@entity38 get in the car			0
' " @entity20 eventually relented and left his home and the neighborhood he helped turn into a strong , solid @entity43 - @entity17 community			1
@entity31 whipped up 15 - foot waves on @entity45 , flooding the @entity47 levee that lies west of @entity4			1
as much as 20 feet of water flooded the neighborhood			0
not a single home in @entity4 was left unscathed			1
water rose nearly to the rooftop of the @entity54 ' home , where @entity20 had planned to ride out the storm			2
a few weeks later , they returned to utter devastation			2
" i did n't know whether to cry , scream			0
i did n't really know what to do , " @entity32 said			0
" but my knees kind of buckled when i looked in here and i was , ' @entity62			0
' " the elderly couple did n't waste any time reflecting : they immediately focused on rebuilding			0
" they had on these white suits with white masks ... and they 're hauling out pieces of sheet rock , " said @entity66 , the youngest of the @entity20 ' four children			0
" my father with a cane , carrying a piece of sheet rock out			0
and i remember calling @entity78 and saying , ' do you know what your parents are doing ? they 're gutting the house ... by themselves			0
' " it was the same spirit and determination that helped create @entity4 where , according to many locals , children were raised with a sense of community and family			1
all four of the @entity20 ' children went on to become successful in their careers -- a common theme for the children of @entity4 such as @entity96 , the current head of the @entity98 ; jazz musician @entity99 ; former mayors @entity100 and @entity102 ; and actor @entity103 from @entity105 's " @entity104			1
" interactive : meet the residents of @entity4 even @entity109 vice president and spokesman @entity108 , originally from @entity13 , is rebuilding his home in @entity4 as he continues to manage the @entity113 oil disaster			1
those successes were built on the sacrifices of the men and women who settled in @entity4 , says @entity103 , who now spends his time in @entity12 starring in the new @entity105 series " @entity121 " about @entity120			1
" my parents ' generation took something ugly like segregation and turned it into ... one of the most stable @entity17 neighborhoods , not only in this city , but around the country , " he said			2
" it was [ a ] dogged fight by these young parents who had this opportunity to build a life for their families in one of the most difficult times in modern history : @entity139 segregation , @entity140 , @entity12			2
" that fight to create a better future for their kids instilled a deep sense of commitment to the neighborhood in @entity103			0
and that is why the actor has committed the past two years to rebuilding @entity4			1
@entity103 staged a massive effort to get the @entity12 to start rebuilding the neighborhood 's blighted and abandoned properties			2
only 30 percent of the neighborhood 's residents had returned two years after @entity31 -- the second slowest rate of return in @entity12 behind the city 's devastated and impoverished @entity155 , according to @entity103			1
opinion : @entity158 on @entity12 today with the help of @entity160 , a management consultant and boyhood friend , @entity103 formed a nonprofit community corporation to get the city to sell back some of the houses so they could be rebuilt and resold at an affordable price			1
it has not all been smooth sailing -- some locals have criticized his involvement			0
" i got a lot of pushback that i was , you know , a local kid come home with some success and trying to do a land grab myself , " @entity103 told @entity1 's @entity170			1
" in november 2008 , @entity12 signed a deal with @entity103 's @entity180 to rebuild 400 homes			2
it was a huge success , but the start of a slow process : a year - and - a - half after the agreement , the city had turned over only four plots			1
today , @entity103 is credited with raising the return rate in @entity189 from about 33 percent to more than 50 percent			2
but not every former resident wants to return			0
@entity191 wants nothing to do with her husband 's plan to rebuild their home in @entity4 , where they raised their son before @entity31			1
@entity199 wants @entity200 , who was 10 years old when @entity31 struck , to enjoy the same childhood he experienced growing up in @entity4			1
" it was a real neighborhood			0
everyone knew who you were , " @entity199 said			0
" everyone looked out for you			0
your neighbors , they 'd chastise you [ if ] they saw you doing something wrong			0
" since 2005 , the @entity191 family has been split between two cities : @entity199 works in @entity12 as a mail carrier , while @entity96 is employed in @entity213 , where she lives with @entity200 who is now in high school			0
she has no plans to return to @entity4			1
" i ca n't go back there , i ca n't do that again , " @entity96 said			0
" @entity62 knows we 've lost enough			0
we lost every single thing we 've ever owned up to that day in 2005			0
... when is the ripple effect going to stop rolling over our lives ? " @entity199 still holds out hope that one day his family will be reunited in @entity4			1
" that 's my home			1
... i was n't going to let it die , and i knew that			0
i always said i 'd go back , " he said			0
" you ca n't really get frustrated or angry with anybody for going through that traumatic experience and not wanting to come back			0
" when asked who he 's building his home for , he responds , " hopefully i 'm building it for my family			1
