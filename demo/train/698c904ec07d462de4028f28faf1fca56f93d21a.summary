@entity0 -- a sweet , active , blonde - haired preschooler -- had gone to sleep feeling fine , perhaps dreaming of playing with his sisters or having a fun day at school			1
he did n't make it through the night			0
while the young boy died sometime between the night of wednesday , september 24 , and the following morning , it was n't until friday night that authorities figured out why : enterovirus @entity7 , a particularly pernicious strain of an otherwise common virus that has been particularly widespread this year			1
while it 's been detected in at least four people who died , @entity0 's case is the first in which authorities have definitively cited enterovirus @entity15 as the cause of death			1
@entity19 , the health officer in @entity0 's hometown of @entity21 , @entity22 , explained saturday that , while the boy was born premature , " he had no other existing condition " and his parents no reason to believe he was direly ill before the virus took his life			1
" he was asymptomatic and fine , and the next morning he had passed , " @entity19 told reporters			1
" so the onset was very rapid , very sudden			0
and that 's clearly the big difference ( between enterovirus @entity7 and other enterovirus strains )			1
" authorities are testing one other child who attended preschool at @entity0 's school , @entity39 , albeit in a different class , for enterovirus @entity15			1
that boy has been treated at @entity42 and is now recovering at home , according to @entity19			1
there are no other suspected cases in the town of 90,000 residents			0
nor is there any sign of pervasive sickness at @entity39 or other town schools , with attendance levels around normal			0
this speaks to the deadliness , the randomness and , in a sense , the pervasiveness of enterovirus @entity58			2
@entity21 mayor @entity60 pointed out that his parents " nor anyone will ever be able to determine where @entity0 may have contracted this virus			1
" " the virus is out in the community , there is nothing we can do about that , " the health officer said			2
" the way to prevent it is from your own personal hygiene and be vigilant with your own children and yourself			0
" officials did not disclose @entity0 's last name during a saturday press briefing			2
more enterovirus cases are likely just last week , the @entity80 @entity79 or state public health laboratories had confirmed 277 cases of enterovirus @entity15			1
that figure has skyrocketed in recent days , to 538 confirmed cases in 43 states and the @entity87 as of friday			1
and there 's no reason to think it wo n't get even worse			2
as the @entity79 points out , " enteroviruses commonly circulate in summer and fall			1
we 're currently in middle of the enterovirus season			2
" not including @entity0 's cases , tests showed enterovirus @entity15 in four people who had died			1
the @entity79 , though , reported then that " the role that @entity99 - @entity7 infection played in these deaths is unclear at this time			1
" @entity102 's medical examiner , dr. @entity101 , was unequivocal about it 's part in @entity0 's death			1
" the child had some brain swelling , it had some lymph node swelling , " @entity19 said			0
" but @entity101 attributed that to the virus as the cause of death			2
" @entity112 is very common , with the @entity79 estimating 10 million to 15 million infections each year in the @entity80			1
but it has about 100 strains , with @entity15 among the most dangerous			0
authorities say this strain has sent more children than usual to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses			1
it seems to be most affecting children with a history of asthma or breathing problems			0
@entity112 may also be linked to a small number of cases of a mysterious neurologic illness in @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131			0
doctors in @entity129 spotted it first -- a group of 10 children hospitalized with limb weakness , cranial nerve dysfunction and abnormalities in their spinal gray matter staff at @entity141 have since identified four patients with the same symptoms			0
and a child in @entity145 , @entity131 , has also developed partial paralysis in the lower limbs after being hospitalized with the virus , according to the @entity149			2
as @entity19 , the @entity21 health officer , explained : " the @entity7 strain is a very virulent strain of entire that would attack young children , preschoolers , toddlers who have for the most part compromised immune systems			1
it has a certain target in our population			0
" hygiene education , cleaning ramped up in schools it 's not clear , though , whether @entity0 should have been any more susceptible than anyone else , beyond his age			2
that and the suddenness of his death makes it especially difficult to fathom or fully understand			0
people in @entity21 , at least , are doing something about it			2
while officials say they 're being careful not to overly alarm students , they are stressing things like hand washing , sneezing into your sleeves , staying home if you 're sick and the like to students , teachers and parents to try to prevent the spread of enterovirus @entity15 and other viruses			0
superintendent @entity187 also said " we have ramped up cleaning in all of our schools , " devoting extra staff and hours to " do cleaning that goes above and beyond what we normally do			0
" then there 's the matter of taking care of @entity0 's family , namely his parents -- both educators -- and two young sisters			0
@entity201 principal @entity200 said that blue - and - yellow bows , her school 's colors , are being put up around the community in @entity0 's honor			0
the late boy 's preschool teacher and an assistant bought a girlish bedroom set and rug to decorate his sisters ' room at home			1
and the school will soon have a " @entity219 " wall to display students ' work , because @entity0 would regularly " ask @entity218 if @entity218 was proud of him , " according to @entity200			0
@entity0 's parents are working with school officials on other things			0
but their focus now is more on grieving , taking care of their daughters and sending a message to the community			0
according to @entity232 , " they are most concerned about giving thanks , which is incredible			0

official : a preschooler went to bed " asymptomatic , " was dead the next morning
a medical examiner now says the boy died suddenly from enterovirus @entity7
there 's no way of telling how the boy contracted the virus , official says
@entity79 confirms 538 people in 43 states have respiratory illnesses caused by enterovirus @entity7
