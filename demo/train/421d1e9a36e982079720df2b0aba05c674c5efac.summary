@entity0 on monday offered a new proposal to extend the payroll tax cut before it expires at the end of the year , and president @entity4 quickly urged @entity5 to help middle - class @entity6 by passing it			1
in a statement to reporters at the @entity11 , @entity4 said failure to act would mean almost 160 million people would pay higher taxes next year , violating a pledge by @entity17 legislators against raising taxes			2
" keep your word to the @entity6 people and do n't raise taxes on them right now , " @entity4 said , arguing that extending the lower payroll tax rate enacted last year would help the nation 's economic recovery			1
" now is the time to keep growing the economy , to keep creating jobs , to keep giving working @entity6 the boost that they need			0
" in reference to the @entity17 opposition to higher taxes , @entity4 asked : " how could it be the only time there 's a catch is when it comes to raising taxes on middle - class families ? " " it does n't make sense , " the president added			2
@entity0 @entity17 fired back immediately , with conservative sen. @entity42 of @entity43 saying the @entity45 plan had no @entity17 input and no chance of passing			1
" it 's hard for the majority to call this a compromise when the other side has n't been involved , " @entity42 said in a statement , adding : " with the long list of things @entity5 has to get done by the end of the year and the clock ticking , it 's pretty mystifying that the majority is pursuing more political show votes that wo n't go anywhere			2
" the issue has become a showdown between @entity0 led by @entity4 and @entity17 in @entity5 over whether to increase taxes on the wealthy to give the rest of the country a tax break next year			1
last week , @entity0 @entity17 blocked progress on a @entity45 plan that would assess a surtax of 3.25 % on income over $ 1 million			1
the new proposal sponsored by sen. @entity74 , @entity75 , contains a reduced version of that tax provision , down to 1.9 % , and calls for it to expire after 10 years , according to a statement by the senator			1
" it will be fully paid for with a mixture of spending cuts @entity17 have already agreed to and a tiny , tiny surtax on the top two - tenths of 1 % of @entity6 taxpayers , " said senate majority leader @entity80 , @entity81 , adding that " in an effort to make our proposal more palatable to @entity17 , we have conceded significantly to cut the tax on income above a million dollars and make it temporary			1
" in addition , the @entity45 plan includes cutting the payroll tax paid by workers from the current rate of 4.2 % to 3.1 %			1
that would mean a family making $ 50,000 a year would save about $ 1,500 , according to @entity0			0
if the tax cut is not extended , the rate would go up to 6.2 % and cost that same family an additional $ 1,000 next year , @entity0 say			1
however , the new @entity45 proposal drops a provision in the measure defeated last week that would also expand the payroll tax cut to employers , @entity74 's statement said			1
cutting out that provision drops the total cost of the measure to $ 180 billion from the $ 265 billion of last week 's proposal , it said			0
in addition to revenue from the so - called " millionaire 's surtax , " the new proposal would be paid for by increasing fees that @entity119 and @entity121 charge mortgage lenders to guarantee repayment of new mortgage loans , @entity74 's statement said			0
the provision was discussed during negotiations by the congressional " super committee " that failed to reach a deficit reduction deal last month , and would raise $ 38.1 billion , according to @entity74 's statement			0
@entity0 also included a provision from a @entity0 @entity17 measure that would prevent millionaires from receiving food stamps and unemployment assistance , a @entity0 @entity45 aide said			0
putting a 10 - year " sunset " on the surtax for millionaires was a response to @entity17 criticism that the original proposal amounted to a permanent tax increase for a temporary economic stimulus plan , the aide added			2
@entity4 's statement noted that the @entity6 economy needs the continued benefits of the payroll tax cut , which puts more money into people 's pockets			1
" although the unemployment rate went down last month , our recovery is still fragile , and the situation in @entity153 has added to that uncertainty , " @entity4 said			0
" and that 's why the majority of economists believe it 's important to extend the payroll tax cut			1
and those same economists would lower their growth estimates for our economy if it does n't happen			0
" at the same time , he said , the reduced tax burden helped families pay bills and increased spending and hiring			0
@entity4 took aim at the @entity17 opposition to higher taxes on the wealthy , which undermined comprehensive deficit reduction negotiations this year			2
@entity17 negotiators have repeatedly rejected @entity4 's push to end @entity175 - era tax cuts on wealthy @entity6			2
" how can you fight tooth - and - nail to protect high - end tax breaks for the wealthiest @entity6 and yet barely lift a finger to prevent taxes going up for 160 million @entity6 who really need the help ? " @entity4 asked			2
a top @entity0 @entity17 aide , who had not yet seen the @entity45 proposal , criticized the broad outline because it still includes a tax increase on wealthy " job creators			1
" @entity17 oppose any kind of tax increase in their push to shrink the size of government , while the @entity11 says raising the taxes of millionaires wo n't affect small business owners cited by @entity17 as job creators who would be hurt by a larger tax burden			0
on sunday , conservative @entity196 sen. @entity196 of @entity197 said he believed the lower payroll tax rate set to expire at the end of the year would be extended , as sought by @entity4			1
however , @entity196 told " @entity205 " that paying for it should include immediate cuts in spending , rather than a drawn - out approach that ends up only reducing additional spending in future years			0
" where is the backbone in @entity209 to actually pay for these extensions in the year in which the money is spent ? " asked @entity196 , a prominent fiscal hawk			0
last week , @entity0 @entity17 prevented democrats from getting the 60 votes needed to proceed on their initial payroll tax cut extension measure , which was blocked on a 51 - 49 vote			1
the @entity45 plan would have assessed a 3.25 % tax on income over $ 1 million to pay for the proposal 's cost			1
taxpayers with an income of $ 50,000 would have benefited by $ 1,500 a year			0
a @entity17 alternative that would have frozen discretionary government spending and cut federal jobs , while also raising @entity227 costs for @entity6 with incomes above $ 750,000 a year , also got blocked by opposition from both parties on a 20 - 78 vote			2
despite the outcome of the votes , a softening of @entity17 opposition to extending the lower payroll tax rate raised expectations for eventual congressional approval of a compromise plan			2
house speaker @entity240 , @entity241 , last week agreed with @entity4 and @entity0 that extending the payroll tax cut would help the economy by putting more money in the pockets of consumers			1
@entity240 's comment broke from conservative @entity17 orthodoxy that contends the payroll tax cut enacted last year had failed to benefit the sluggish economic recovery			1
@entity11 @entity17 leaders have assembled their own proposal to extend the payroll tax cut in conjunction with other steps , but that plan faced opposition from conservative @entity17			1
@entity240 has insisted that any extensions of tax cuts or other programs be paid for , and he outlined a list of spending cuts over 10 years to offset the impact on the deficit , according to @entity11 @entity17 aides			0
however , a group of fiscally conservative republicans opposed the @entity17 leaders ' plan because the offsetting spending cuts would take a decade to complete			0
some @entity17 worried about the political fallout for their party if the public holds them responsible for holding up middle - class tax relief			0
" if we do n't extend the payroll tax ( cut ) , we 're giving the @entity0 an issue , " said rep. @entity273 , @entity241 - @entity274			2
" there is no need to give it to them			0
they 're the ones who mismanaged the economy			0
they are the ones who put us in this situation			0
we should n't allow them to get out from under that			0
" in his statement monday , @entity4 cited the shifting position of @entity17 on the issue and called for @entity5 to also extend unemployment benefits set to expire at the end of the year			1
" we can not play games with unemployment insurance when we still have an unemployment rate that is way too high , " @entity4 said , adding : " this is n't just something that i want			0
this is n't just a political fight			0
independent economists , some of whom have in the past worked for @entity17 , agree that if we do n't extend the payroll tax cut and we do n't extend unemployment insurance , it will hurt our economy			1

the proposed tax on the wealthy would be 1.9 % for income over $ 1 million
