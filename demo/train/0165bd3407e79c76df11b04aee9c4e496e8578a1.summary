-- the blowout is stopped			1
the oil disaster that began with an explosion 100 days ago has not ended by any means			1
but we seem to be seeing a murky ending to the beginning of the crisis			2
we have an enormous amount of floating oil , and @entity12 waters polluted by oil and dispersant			1
most estimates range from 2 million to 4 million barrels ( 84 million to 168 million gallons )			2
the higher end would make it the largest unintended release of oil ever			1
( in 1991 , @entity21 's army intentionally released about 400 to 500 million gallons into the @entity12 to slow @entity23 troops			2
) added to the @entity25 's troubles : about 2 million gallons of dispersant , a major intentional pollution event in itself			2
what now ? as a naturalist , i 'd say the wildlife effects remain hard to grasp			1
the damage to people is most easily observable , best quantified and perhaps even most acute			1
regionally there 's been further damage to @entity37 marshes already assaulted by decades of channel - cutting , shipping , water direction , erosion and sinkage			1
for resident wildlife , undersea oil and dispersant endangers countless sea creatures -- from plankton to whale sharks to dolphins and whales -- including reefs and the eggs and larvae of corals , fishes , crabs and oysters			1
watch a talk by @entity59 at @entity60 of hemispheric importance are creatures that range widely but funnel through the @entity12 to migrate or to breed			1
two of the most important breeders are the world 's most endangered sea turtle -- the @entity67 -- and the giant bluefin tuna , one of the most overfished of the world 's giant ocean fishes			1
migrants include millions of shorebirds , ducks and geese ; herons and egrets ; gannets , loons , terns , skimmers and other seabirds ; peregrine falcons , ospreys and @entity12 - crossing songbirds that often land exhausted on beaches and marshes			2
how many of these creatures , and what proportion of their populations , were damaged or spared , no one can say			2
every oiled carcass found may suggest 10 to 100 undetected deaths			2
but it 's also true that at this point -- with much of the oil yet to go somewhere -- there remain numerous clean - looking pelicans , gleaming gulls , and immaculate egrets along @entity12 shores and marshes			1
people , though , have taken deep and immediate hits			1
closures have meant an end to fishing , cessation of a way of life and of the way thousands of people understand who they are			1
some may say the closures are artificial , that there are still plenty of fish , probably safe to eat			2
others say the seafood safety is unreliable , and that , anyway , future consumer confidence is the most important thing to preserve			2
there 's truth to both sides			2
the mere tainting of beaches has been enough to send beachgoers fleeing to other destinations , creating a real - estate implosion , hordes of refunded deposits , halted construction and thousands of service jobs lost			1
nationally , we 're all connected by the loss to the nation 's seafood supply and by taxpayer funded government expenses related to agencies such as the @entity141 and @entity142 , as well as lost attention on other issues , and added unemployment costs that wo n't be covered by @entity146			1
no one knows whether the seafood and tourism and fisheries will be clean and healthy again next year or in a decade			2
we should be willing to learn some lessons			2
one is that this catastrophe was n't just an accident			1
it was the result of reckless corner - cutting by the oil company and scandalously compromised oversight by the government			1
as @entity23 rep. @entity163 , @entity164 , observed , " @entity146 appears to have made multiple decisions for economic reasons that increased the danger of a catastrophic well failure			0
" the compromised oversight included the @entity166 failing to require a backup shutdown system required in much of the rest of the world , failing to require offshore drillers to file plans to deal with major oil spills and specifically allowing @entity146 to drill without a detailed environmental analysis			1
the @entity175 administration gave top @entity177 jobs to former lobbyists of the fossil fuel industry			0
now the inspector general finds that @entity177 had " a culture of substance abuse and promiscuity			0
" another lesson : preparedness is near zero			0
the only two things responders could quickly muster were booms that ca n't handle open water , and dispersants			0
but dispersants sink oil , defeating the idea behind booms , polluting much more water , making the oil more widely toxic to marine life and making it impossible to recover or clean up			1
absent preparedness , @entity146 and other companies responding to the spill made stuff up as they went ; during weeks of blundering , hare - brained schemes like using shredded tires and golf balls to " top kill " the well , and fabricating new slap - dab caps and domes that did n't work			0
meanwhile people sent their hair clippings to the @entity12			1
that is not a response plan			0
obviously , reforms are needed			0
rig regulations should now require that the best equipment and procedures are used			0
to eliminate guesswork and argument , these procedures must be specified and quantified			0
for instance , blowout preventers should have a specified number of valves for drilling in a particular range of depths , all spelled out as requirements			0
further , there should be explicit checklists and decision trees			0
if the driller detects a possible problem , the operation must be shut down ; they must not retain the option of arguing about whether it 's probably ok to keep going			0
a culture of safety and best practices must replace the culture of risk			0
we should never again be subjected to the comment , " we 've never tried this at this depth			0
" it 's as if , after the house is on fire , they set about devising and then building a truck capable of spraying water			0
with all the contracting companies servicing thousands of rigs , you 'd think the oil giants would have , say , two or three pieces of equipment in a warehouse somewhere capable of stopping and controlling a blowout at one of their wells -- and capturing the oil			1
this should be devised and required			0
because an oil company 's interests are not aligned with the public 's interests , the oil company must be liable , but not in charge			1
allowing an oil company to run the response to a spill makes it possible for it to try to hide the amount of oil and the numbers of wildlife killed , to suppress scientific data and hamper journalists			1
the federal government should nationalize major spills , avail itself of the best pooled talent in the oil industry , and send the offending company the people 's bill			1
once it 's on our property , the offending oil company should not touch anything unless specifically directed to do so			1
as it is now , things are so insanely backward that at the end of june the @entity141 made it a felony for boats to get within 70 feet of boom			0
we need to stop putting the murderer in charge of the crime scene			0
the mortgage bubble , banking collapse , taxpayer - funded bailouts and this blowout all stem from a three - decade assault on government effectiveness , the consequent deregulation @entity311 , and the unleashing of corporate greed and corporate " personhood			1
" corporate capture of government away from the public 's interests is the basic poison			1
campaign finance reform and publicly funded elections would be the antidote			0
lastly and probably most important , to honor the scale of this catastrophe , we need to create a historic moment that begins to give us some energy options and creates a graceful phase - in of greater reliance on the clean , eternal energy that actually runs our planet			0
there are many reasons to do this			0
blowouts and dead workers and the awful environmental destruction wrought by coal mining and oil are some			2
helping weaken petro - dictators and gaining @entity23 energy independence is major			0
helping stabilize world climate and the acidifying seas , and securing agriculture , are yet others			0
providing jobs , incentives for construction and investment opportunities are others still			0
the basic vision is to reduce oil subsidies , create a level playing field for clean renewable energies like wind , solar , tidal , geothermal , algae fuels , etc ; construct a national smart grid capable of carrying power produced by any energy source whether dirty or renewable from where it 's abundant to where it 's needed			2
electric cars would be the grid 's storage battery			0
other countries -- @entity372 and some in northern @entity373 -- are doing this			2
but i 'd rather see @entity23 leadership regained			0
the nation that owns the future of energy will own the future			0
i want that nation of the future to be the @entity23			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity59 .			1

@entity59 says *precise* size of oil disaster and impact on wildlife is not known
he says impact on people is clearer -- since many lost their livelihood
@entity59 says accident was *avoidable* if proper *safeguards* had been in place
decades of government deregulation helped lead to disaster , he says
