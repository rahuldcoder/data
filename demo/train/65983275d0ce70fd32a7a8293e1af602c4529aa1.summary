-- lately , @entity1 has been looking a little different			1
no , the network has n't traded in the made - for - tv love stories that first charmed the network 's loyal female viewers			1
it has , however , adopted a new slew of original programming designed to help @entity1 stay competitive in the age of reality tv			1
to that end , stage moms , amateur fashion designers , nannies and criminals have all found a home on the network			2
" @entity1 , for years , thrived on reruns and made for tv movies that told women 's stories , " said @entity18 , the editor of @entity19			1
" it makes so much more sense to let real women tell their stories in reality tv shows than scripted shows			1
those stories are more accessible and more consequential -- and often more entertaining			0
" by offering more reality programming , @entity1 is merely bearing witness to what the data continues to show -- unscripted shows bring in viewers			1
according to a recent report by @entity39 , reality shows draw the largest share of the @entity42 audience , 56.4 % for the 2010 - 2011 season , up from 47.9 % the year before			1
@entity1 has found success with " @entity45 , " a reality show about young dancers and their moms , which was renewed for a second season on tuesday			1
the " toddlers and @entity55 's " - like dance show , set in @entity57 , @entity58 , reeled in about 1.8 million viewers its last episode			2
meanwhile , about 2.4 million people tuned in for " @entity60 " last thursday , a show which @entity1 acquired in 2009			2
" getting " @entity60 " was a good kick start , " @entity18 added			0
" it helped them figure out what they wanted to be			0
networks tend to make this change when it makes sense for them			0
... we 're still in the early stages of this wave			0
" " @entity60 " spin - offs , including " @entity74 " and " @entity75 , " will debut in the coming months			0
" @entity76 , " a new , unscripted series featuring an " @entity79 homegrown nanny , " and " @entity80 , " which the network picked up earlier this month after @entity82 canceled it , will both air later this year , according to @entity1 's website			1
it 's not odd to see series like " @entity45 " and " @entity76 , " which draw on the formats of other successful shows , appear on a different network , @entity18 said			1
" there 's all kinds of duplication in reality , " he said			0
" how many @entity96 - set shows do we have right now ? probably too many , but if its works and gets the demographic the network needs ... it 's just borrowing another format			1
it has n't all been high ratings and devoted audiences , however			0
@entity1 has had at least two reality flops			1
" @entity107 , " @entity109 's tv comeback , was recently canceled after its first season			0
the network 's answer to " @entity112 " -- " @entity113 " -- also underwhelmed viewers			1
but it 's not just about being a contender in the reality game for the network			2
formerly the premiere destination for " @entity120 " and " @entity122 " reruns , @entity1 has made way for all types of new original content in the last few years			1
" @entity131 " will join scripted dramas like " @entity127 , " which was recently renewed for a fourth season , and " @entity129 , " which has been on the air since 2007			0
@entity132 will star in and executive produce " @entity131 " -- based off the network 's 2010 original movie of the same name			2
all the new original content is why @entity137 , @entity1 's executive vice president of programming , calls the network a triple threat			1
" we program all three major tv genres -- reality , scripted series and scripted movies , " @entity137 said			1
" no other women 's brand can say that			0
" " we used to be dependent on reruns of network shows , " he said , adding , " @entity1 movies are legendary -- our legacy and our future			1
" but that does n't mean original programming is n't important			1
" original , exciting characters bring exciting tv that people ca n't get anywhere else , " he said			2
originally marketed as " @entity160 , " @entity137 said @entity1 's current mantra , " connect			2
share " -- which came to be in 2008 -- better embodies the network 's new goal to appeal to everyone			0
" i 'm trying to make @entity1 acceptable to everybody , " he said			2
" i do want to have shows on the air that do n't feel like they 're just for women			2
... in the past , it felt like a channel that men should n't be watching			0
we want to have shows that have broad appeal that can be watched by anybody			0
" which might explain the network 's decision to pick up @entity183 's " @entity80			0
" " ' @entity184 definitely has an audience , " @entity18 said			0
it was smart to pick it up			0
it has some value , too			0
i do n't think it will be a huge hit for them , but i 'm sure it will do well			0

@entity1 is not just about made - for - tv movies aimed at women *anymore*
the network is *gravitating* towards original programming and reality shows
shows like " @entity45 " and " @entity113 " trade on existing reality formats
