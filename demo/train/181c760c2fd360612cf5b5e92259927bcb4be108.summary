-- incredible architecture and art are splendid and interesting enough but when i go to @entity4 , i want to eat			2
which is why , after a dozen trips to the country , i decided to settle into the city of @entity9 for a few weeks and consume as much as i possibly could			1
now , every @entity10 will tell you that their region makes the best food			1
but for many , the best @entity10 food comes from the region of @entity17 , of which @entity9 is the capital			1
meat ragu , tortellini , lasagna , parmigiano cheese , mortadella , coppa and balsamic vinegar -- all have roots here and the resulting regional dishes are truly sublime			2
through dozens of meals at dozens of restaurants , i compiled this one - day dining guide to the culinary and sensory overload that is @entity17			1
the only two requirements ? bring extra cash and arrive hungry			2
eat like a local : share your favorite spots for superb regional eats a light , social start the @entity10 breakfast or colazione , is much lighter than the @entity44 version			1
it involves a simple coffee and a pastry , often filled with custard , cream or chocolate			1
my @entity10 friends , @entity53 and @entity54 , took me to their favorite breakfast stop one morning			2
for four years , every single day , the @entity56 have walked 15 minutes downtown to the @entity58 © ( via @entity59 34 )			2
this modern and unusual version of the typical @entity10 coffee shop is situated inside a bookstore			2
@entity54 peruses books and orders his daily macchiato while @entity53 prefers a frothy and creamy cappuccino estivo			1
" @entity69 , " or the people , however , are what @entity54 loves most about his breakfast stop			2
in @entity4 , breakfast is more a social event than anything else , where you catch up with friends and start the day with hugs , handshakes and small talk			2
pastry and coffee is more of an afterthought , but a really tasty one			2
i also stumbled upon a wonderful coffee bar during my stay , called @entity85 © ( @entity86 25 ) , just a few minutes walk east of downtown			2
the coffee is excellent and prepared with great care , made better with a slice of fresh bread topped with a dollop of locally made marmellata			1
the real eating begins lunch in @entity4 was once regarded as the most important meal of the day			2
now , as the cities and towns modernize and more of the younger people are working in offices rather than the fields , lunchtime has become less complex and time consuming			0
unless of course , you 're a tourist like myself and want to eat till your belly extends and your breath shortens			0
if that 's the case , many restaurants still oblige			1
one such restaurant is @entity111 ( @entity112 54 ) , about a 20 - minute walk from downtown on a quiet unassuming street			0
plan to take your time here and arrive ravenous			0
my friend @entity118 and i ordered a regional white wine and enthusiastically awaited our antipasti : homemade pickled vegetables in olive oil which were perfectly balanced and not too acidic			1
@entity124 arrived the famous @entity125 or regional @entity127 ham aged for one year along the @entity128 -- an area whose winter fogs and humid summers make the air unlike any other in the world , plus the local @entity136 cheese , aged 30 months			1
to taste the finest parmigiano cheese is not understood until tried , savored			0
@entity118 's stuffed zucchini with meatballs evoked memories of how her own @entity10 grandmother used to cook , while my freshly made rigatoni with a white ragout of small sausage meatballs , cannellini beans and rosemary was by far the most memorable pasta experience i had in @entity17			1
you just ca n't believe food can taste this good			1
( @entity152 local dishes tortellini in brodo and tagliatelli al ragu are also on the menu here			1
) satiated , we passed on a second course in exchange for the hot chocolate cake with red currants			0
one fork piercing elicited a liquid chocolate so good i could n't speak			0
i just about licked my plate clean , like any good @entity10			0
an irresistible snack get up slowly			0
with a satisfied lethargy , walk along the pretty porticoes that are the backbone to this cosmopolitan city			0
after 30 minutes or so , i like to think you 've walked long enough to deserve a gelato			0
dating back to the 16th century in @entity4 , gelato is made primarily with milk rather than cream , giving it a lower milk - fat content than ice cream			0
it 's denser than @entity44 ice cream with less air whipped into it , which intensifies the flavors			1
@entity182 is an innovative gelato shop , situated on @entity184 close to the @entity185 , that uses all organic ingredients			1
their specialties include chocolate and pistachio - based flavors			0
try the wasabi gelato or chocolate with ginger			0
to eat more at this point seems almost inconceivable , but it 's amazing what a late day leisurely stroll and an espresso can do			1
you sit down to rest in a pretty piazza , the stomach growls slightly and your next thought appears with an anxious , slow smile , " time for dinner ! " one more delicious meal " to give is to receive , " is the mantra followed by the owner of @entity209 , a cozy family - run restaurant that 's located in the @entity213 area			1
gluttons find true bliss here as dishes are brought out in succession , delivered in big , family style bowls			0
if any meal felt like an @entity10 feast , it was this dinner			0
@entity222 , ricotta cheese , crusted bread , liver pate , baked tomatoes with cheesy breadcrumbs , celery salad , grilled eggplant , braised endive , roasted zucchini , mortadella , prosciutto ... yes , we ate all of that , and that was just the antipasti			0
great @entity10 food forces you to stop and take your time			1
we savored every bite , paused for audible and elongated ' mmmms , ' and pressed on with mushroom risotto and fettuccine with pumpkin and pancetta			0
both dishes reminded me that if you take deep breaths , you might make room for a little more			0
we drank , ate , drank , ate and finished our plates			0
breathe ... in @entity9 , you can get around quite well with @entity252			1
but it is wise to learn a few words and phrases , like " @entity256 " ( stop ) " @entity257 " ( i am full ) or " no ce la faccio piu " ( i ca n't take anymore )			1
feast in all these restaurants in just one day and you 'll be repeating every one of these phrases			1
but the peculiar thing is , you 'll head home , have a good slumber , wake up and want to do it all over again			0
pasticcini anyone ? follow @entity0 on @entity266 @ @entity267 @entity268 writes daily about southern artists and home design on her blog , @entity271 .			0
