cordless tools your life may be safer and more comfortable because of inventions that came from space research			2
as long as @entity7 was going to the trouble of sending @entity10 astronauts to the moon , it figured it might as well equip them with drills and ask them to dig up rock samples when they got there			1
but realizing that a 239,000 - mile extension cord would be impractical , @entity7 teamed up with @entity18 to develop tools that featured rechargeable batteries and special low - power consumption motors , which should make your @entity22 seem a lot more impressive			1
smoke detectors in the 1970s , @entity7 partnered with @entity26 to create a device that would detect smoke and toxic gases in @entity30 , @entity32 's first space station			1
the result was the first ionization smoke detector , using a minute amount of the radioactive isotope @entity36			0
this led to the 1979 introduction of inexpensive photoelectric detection devices , which go off when smoke ( or sometimes a hot , steamy shower ) blocks the light beam			0
to date , smoke detectors have saved countless lives here on @entity46 , but they 're especially useful in space , where running outside to wait for the fire truck is n't an option			2
enriched baby food @entity7 - sponsored research has also helped make major improvements to commercially available baby food , and we 're not talking about freeze - dried strained peas			1
while testing the potential of algae as a food supply for long - duration space travel , a @entity56 - based biosciences company discovered an algae additive that contains two fatty acids closely resembling those found in human breast milk			2
the company now uses it to make an enriched infant formula called @entity67 , thought to be essential for babies ' visual and mental development			0
new - age pavement when you buy a new set of tires , the old ones have to go somewhere , right ? most of them end up in huge , flammable tire dumps , which may hold millions of old tires , each one containing about a quart of oil in the rubber			0
if a dump catches fire , however , it can burn with a thick , toxic smoke for weeks on end			0
but today , old tires are being put to good use			0
@entity7 's experience in fuel - related cryogenics helped develop processes to freeze the tires to below -200 degrees @entity92 so that they crumble , separating the rubber from other materials and producing what 's called " crumb			1
" this waste is recycled into several new products , including an ingredient used to pave highways , which means your new radial tires may someday be rolling over your old ones			0
those cool ear thermometers any parent knows you do n't take a baby 's temperature by sticking a glass thermometer in its mouth , but inserting it the other way is n't much fun , either			0
and what about the incapacitated patient who ca n't even say " aaah " ? the @entity117 of @entity118 wanted a safer way to take a person 's temperature , and who better to turn to than @entity7 's @entity123 , the place with over 30 years of experience using infrared sensors to remotely observe celestial bodies ? together , they developed a fast and accurate thermometer that , when its disposable probe cover ( to prevent cross-infection ) is inserted into the ear canal , detects infrared radiation from the eardrum and gives a digital readout in less than two seconds			1
fast - acting dental braces do your old - fashioned braces set off airport metal detectors ? save yourself embarrassing strip searches by getting new ones			0
many orthodontists now use ceramic braces that are bonded to the teeth and strung together with a thin , light wire made of @entity148 ( nickel - titanium ) , an alloy brought to you compliments of @entity7			1
because of its amazing ability to maintain its original shape , @entity148 ( as it 's known in the industry ) provides space satellites with the ability to spring open after being cramped and contorted inside a rocket			2
but do n't think its capabilities are limited to space			2
when used in dental appliances , @entity148 exerts a continuous force against the teeth to move in the right direction , eliminating the need for wire tightening , thus reducing a patient 's overall time in braces ... and much of the pain			0
protective paint what do the @entity172 , a gigantic buddha in @entity174 and the @entity175 all have in common ? they 're protected by the @entity32 space program ... sort of			1
in the late 1980s , @entity7 's @entity179 began a research program to develop coatings for the @entity182 in @entity183 to shield the launch structures from salt - air corrosion , rocket exhaust and thermal stress			1
applications of this material proved ideal for protecting structures like bridges , antenna towers and the occasional big @entity173			0
( @entity193 ) cardiac pacemakers pacemakers have come a long way since their invention in 1950			2
far from the large , external contraptions used early on , modern pacemakers can self - adjust in most cases and even activate themselves when needed			2
but one of the most significant advances in pacemaker technology came in the 1970s , with the help of a @entity7 - developed system of communication called bi-directional telemetry , originally used to communicate with satellites			1
@entity210 teamed with @entity7 to develop a similar telemetry system , which not only allows doctors to make changes to the unit 's function over time , but also updates them on how the device is interacting with the patient -- all without picking up a scalpel			1
scratch - resistant glasses thanks to @entity7 technology , plastic lenses for glasses last up to 10 times longer than they used to			1
that 's because its @entity226 created a scratch - resistant ( read : extremely hard ) coating to protect equipment from getting beaten up by space debris			1
later , the @entity231 acquired the license for the coating method and used it in their plastic sunglasses , which matched the hardness of glass lenses , but were much lighter			2
among other uses , it 's now employed in most eyewear and industrial face shields			0
oh - so comfy sneaker insoles ca n't run a five - minute mile ? do n't blame your sneakers			0
if they 're relatively new , they 're probably giving you quite a bit of help already			0
in the 1970s , many shoe manufacturers began replacing their standard foam rubber insoles with a new , highly shock - absorbent material -- one giant step for tennis shoes			0
the new kicks were padded with " viscoelastic " bubbles that conformed to your foot and then returned to their normal shape when you took the shoes off			0
turns out , they got the idea ( and the technology ) from @entity7 , which had developed the material to better cushion astronauts during blastoff			1
and one pop culture killer despite popular theory , @entity7 did not invent @entity269 orange breakfast drink for the astronauts			1
it was introduced in 1957 by @entity271 and was on grocery store shelves for years before @entity7 decided it worked well in space			1
