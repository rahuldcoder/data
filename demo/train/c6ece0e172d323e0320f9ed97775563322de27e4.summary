a report expected this week from the @entity1 has @entity2 abuzz with talk of the potential for a pre-emptive strike on @entity7 's nuclear facilities			1
@entity9 diplomats have told @entity10 that the report says @entity7 has mastered the critical steps necessary to design and build a nuclear weapon			1
missiles are not , of course , the only way to launch an attack			0
@entity7 's nuclear facilities are under siege from cyber attacks			1
and one , the @entity23 virus , was able to penetrate @entity7 's @entity25 nuclear facility , researchers say			1
how did it work ? @entity23 was stealthy			1
the @entity25 computer network is a closed system , separated from any other network or internet access			2
so , @entity23 infected a third party first , likely a trusted contractor to the @entity25 facility			1
that contractor may then have unknowingly passed on the virus by plugging in an infected removable drive into the computers inside the @entity25 facility			1
more importantly , @entity23 was smart			2
it knew exactly what it was looking for : a specific software called @entity39 used specifically to run the @entity41 controllers operating at @entity25			2
@entity23 spread through the network undetected			2
if it did n't find the step 7 software , it left things alone			0
but once it found its target , @entity23 set to work			2
first , it effectively hijacked the @entity25 control system , speeding up or slowing down the centrifuges , wearing them out prematurely			2
as the centrifuges destroyed themselves , @entity23 sent back signals that everything was fine and running smoothly			0
so , the operators may not have known this was happening until it was too late			0
so , just how effective was @entity23 ? according to the @entity54 , @entity1 records show that between the end of 2009 and early 2010 about 1,000 centrifuges at @entity25 had to be replaced			1
@entity23 is the suspected culprit			0
still , that 's only about one out of every nine centrifuges and , despite a minor dip in production , uranium enrichment continued apace			0
who created @entity23 is still a mystery			0
many computer security researchers believe the virus is so complex and sophisticated that it would have needed the resources of a nation state -- or a combination of states -- to produce it			0
researchers at internet security firm @entity72 say they have identified a new virus called @entity74 that they believe is a successor to @entity23 , although not all security experts agree			1
" this is not a copycat , " insists @entity77 of @entity72			0
" whoever created this had access to the same source code as @entity23			0
" @entity77 says @entity74 is , at this stage , a malware designed simply to spy and collect information from @entity7 's computer systems , but she suspects it may be ultimately intended for sabotage			1
" it could be that @entity23 did n't entirely achieve what was wanted the first time around , " @entity77 told @entity10			0
@entity74 was released as late as august 2010 , just after the @entity23 virus had done its damage , stunning many researchers who had not expected to see another virus of the same complexity released so quickly			1
@entity97 , the @entity98 computer security specialist credited with discovering @entity23 , says it does n't matter who created @entity74			0
the problem , he says , is that @entity23 , in its bid to stop nuclear proliferation , may have sparked its own arms race			1
" the first cyberwar weapon is comparable to the first nuclear weapon , " he wrote in a blog post recently			1
" to build the first nuclear bomb , it took a genius like @entity110 and the resources of the @entity113 project			0
to copy the design , it requires just a bunch of engineers -- no genius needed .			0

@entity2 abuzz with talk of potential for pre-emptive strike on @entity7 's nuclear facilities
@entity9 diplomats say @entity1 report says @entity7 able to design and build nuclear weapon
@entity7 's nuclear facilities have also come under attack from cyber attacks
one such attack by @entity23 virus able to penetrate @entity7 's @entity25 nuclear facility
