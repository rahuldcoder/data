-- the evening was supposed to be about remembering former @entity1 and @entity3 captain @entity2 , who died 20 years ago , but in the end it was @entity6 who provided the memories at @entity8 with another unforgettable display			1
the @entity10 scored twice , with his second coming in the 90th minute , as @entity12 came from behind to win 3 - 2 at @entity3 and move up to third in the @entity13			1
@entity6 , who has now scored eight of his team 's last ten goals in all competitions , was the main talking point at the final whistle but the game kicked off with the thoughts of @entity1 's only @entity23 - winning captain uppermost in spectators ' minds			1
the former defender , who died on 24 february 1993 at the age of 51 , was honored as fans and players from both clubs provided a minute 's applause , with home supporters creating a mosaic reading " @entity36 " in the stand named after him			0
his three grandchildren -- @entity38 , 21 , @entity39 , 16 and @entity40 , 13 -- had led the teams out as they carried the match ball onto the pitch			0
" twenty years gone , never forgotten " were the words that not only beamed out of the stadium 's giant television screens but were also stitched into the jerseys of the @entity3 players			2
having joined his local club as a teenager , @entity2 became a legend for a side he represented between 1958 and 1974 , winning the @entity53 in 1964 and then the @entity54 ( a competition eligible for those @entity57 sides that had won their domestic cup ) a year later			1
yet it was his displays with @entity1 in 1966 that cemented his place in football folklore for a defender rated as one of the best to have ever played the game			0
" it was @entity2 's ultimate goal to play for @entity1 , " @entity2 's wife @entity69 told the @entity71 's website			2
" i remember him saying to me one day when we went to the old @entity78 , ' you have no idea what it feels like to walk onto that pitch , it 's like levitating '			0
" it meant everything to him to represent his country at @entity78			0
" on 30 july 1966 , @entity2 's dreams came true as @entity1 won the @entity23 on home soil , defeating great rivals @entity88 in the final at @entity78 -- outside of which a statue of their former captain proudly stands today			0
@entity3 played a lead role in @entity1 's success , with @entity2 captaining the side , forward @entity96 scoring a hat - trick ( still the only player to do so in a @entity23 final ) and midfielder @entity100 grabbing the home side 's only other goal			1
four years later , as @entity1 tried to defend their trophy in @entity104 , @entity2 led his team 's resistance against @entity107 in the group stages -- playing so well that the legendary @entity109 , whose team went on to win the trophy that year , singled him out for praise			1
" of the hundreds of defenders who played against me during my career i pick @entity2 as the greatest of them all , " the @entity71 website quoted @entity109 , the only player to have won three @entity23 trophies , as saying			0
@entity2 , who died from cancer , was also praised for his fine sportsmanship -- with a photo of himself and @entity109 greeting one another with mutual respect after their @entity104 clash , which @entity107 won 1 - 0 , coming to symbolize what football 's soul should be about for many			2
the defender wore the number 6 shirt for both club and country and the reason there was no @entity3 player sporting that digit on the back of their jersey against @entity12 is that the club retired the shirt five years ago in memory of @entity2			1
after six minutes , there was another commemoration for a player who had a brief spell with another @entity145 club , @entity144 , late in his career as applause broke out around the ground but soon after , it was @entity6 who stole the show			0
the 23 - year - old pounced upon a defensive error from @entity3 to fire home from the edge of the box but the visitors ' advantage was nullified as @entity159 won -- and then scored -- a penalty			2
just before the hour , @entity3 fans began to think that the tribute to @entity2 would be crowned in fitting style as @entity164 gave the home side the lead -- while at the other end , goalkeeper @entity167 was pulling off a string of fine saves			1
he could not prevent @entity171 equalizing 14 minutes from time however , so creating the platform for @entity6 to score a stunning winner as he lashed a strike into the top corner from 30 yards			0
the win represented a crucial three points in @entity12 's bid to qualify for next year 's @entity179 , with @entity12 leaping above @entity180 and , more importantly for some , going four points clear of rivals @entity182 -- who they host in sunday 's @entity185			1
elsewhere in @entity57 , second - placed @entity186 were held to a 0 - 0 draw at @entity188 , leaving them six points behind @entity192 leaders @entity193 .			0

@entity6 scores twice as @entity12 come from behind to win 3 - 2 at @entity3
@entity10 lights up a night where former @entity3 legend @entity2 is remember
@entity198 takes @entity12 above @entity180 into third in the @entity13 table
