@entity0 -- lawyers for radical @entity4 cleric @entity3 and four fellow suspects presented last - ditch arguments tuesday against their extradition from @entity8 to the @entity9 to face terrorism charges			1
@entity11 , whose followers included the so - called " shoe bomber " @entity18 and who once called @entity15 leader @entity14 a " hero , " faces 11 charges in @entity9 courts			2
extradition ruling marks end of era for radical cleric the charges include conspiracy in connection with a 1998 kidnapping of 16 @entity29 in @entity30 , and conspiring with others to establish an @entity33 training camp in rural @entity34 in 1999			0
he faces a potential life sentence if convicted			0
last week , after almost a decade of legal battles , the @entity37 ruled that the cleric and four other suspects could be sent to the @entity9			2
the men 's lawyers appealed the ruling			1
a two - judge panel at @entity0 's @entity45 must now decide whether the defendants ' lawyers can show new and compelling reasons to stop the extradition			1
lawyers for @entity51 and @entity52 argued tuesday that if they are extradited to the @entity9 , their detention in super-maximum security prisons would breach their human rights under @entity57 law			1
the court was also told that new evidence from an @entity15 informer weakened the case against @entity52 in relation to his alleged involvement in bomb attacks against @entity9 embassies in @entity66 in 1998			1
the informer , @entity67 , made no mention of @entity52 's name in an 800 - page briefing document given to @entity71 , @entity8 's spy agency , the court heard			0
@entity67 , a @entity72 , was an early member of @entity15 who pleaded guilty in 2000 to his involvement in the @entity66 bombings and gave evidence against co-defendants			0
in return , he entered a witness protection program			0
lawyers for the @entity9 argued , however , that there was a strong case against both @entity51 and @entity52			1
this included the presence of @entity51 's fingerprints on a claim of responsibility faxed before the bomb even went off , they said			0
the other suspects facing extradition to the @entity9 are @entity90 and @entity91			1
apart from @entity3 , none has been convicted of any offense			2
the lawyer representing @entity3 is expected to present his arguments against extradition on wednesday , one of them being his client 's failing health			1
the judge will also question lawyers from @entity0 's @entity102 and @entity8 's government - run @entity103			1
they are expected to face questions about why they passed key evidence straight to @entity9 authorities rather than pursuing prosecutions in the @entity8			1
born in @entity109 in 1958 , @entity3 traveled to @entity8 to study before gaining citizenship through marriage in the 1980s			2
a one - time nightclub bouncer in @entity0 's @entity114 district , @entity3 -- also known as @entity115 -- has said he lost both hands and one eye while fighting against the @entity119 occupation of @entity120			2
he often wore a hook in place of one hand			0
in 1997 , @entity3 became the imam of a north @entity0 mosque , where his hate - filled speeches attacking the @entity29 began to attract national attention and followers , including @entity18 , the so - called " shoe bomber " who attempted to blow up a @entity132 - bound passenger airplane three months after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			2
@entity11 has called the 9/11 attacks on the @entity135 " a towering day in history " and described @entity14 as " a good guy and a hero			0
" he also described the @entity140 space shuttle disaster in 2003 as " punishment from @entity142 " because the astronauts were @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146			0
the cleric is one of the highest - profile radical @entity4 figures in @entity8 , where he was already sentenced to seven years for inciting racial hatred at his north @entity0 mosque and other terrorism - related charges			0
last week 's decision , which was signed by seven judges from different @entity57 nations , followed a ruling this spring in which the same court likewise said that @entity159 and the four other terror suspects could be extradited			0
the suspects would not get " ill treatment " in super-maximum security prisons if they are extradited to the @entity9 and convicted in @entity9 courts , according to the @entity57 court 's decision last monday			1
that ruling noted that conditions in such @entity9 prisons are in some ways better for inmates than in @entity57 , given that they 'd have access to television , newspapers , social visits and hobby - related items			1
it acknowledged the prisoners might be confined to their cells most of the time , but said this was warranted given the charges they face			0
more : @entity184 apologizes to @entity185 over @entity159 @entity1 's @entity186 and @entity187 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity3 's lawyers are *due* to present their arguments wednesday
