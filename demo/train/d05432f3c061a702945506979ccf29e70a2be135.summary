@entity1 , @entity0 -- as familiar and reassuring as the map of the world is , there is only so much that physical geography can tell us about the state of the planet			2
forest loss : this cartogram shows areas where the worst deforestation occured from 1990 to 2000			0
a new book , @entity15 , has redrawn the map giving vivid new insights and bringing economic , social and environmental data to life			1
not since the @entity22 meteorologist , @entity21 , sketched out the first detailed theories of continental drift has the world appeared so misshapen , so otherworldly			0
the 366 cartograms ( statistical maps ) which make up the book twist , shrink and distend countries and continents into all sorts of shapes and sizes			1
the book and the accompanying web site were devised by @entity35 , professor of human geography at the @entity37 's @entity36 , @entity38 , a research associate at @entity36 and @entity39 , a professor of physics at the @entity41			0
work on the project began in earnest in 2006 when @entity35 teamed up with @entity39 , who had co-created a new software technique for creating equal area cartograms the year before			1
with the software in place , the painstaking task of assembling the data began			1
the information was drawn from a variety of organizations including the @entity54 , the @entity55 and the @entity56			0
for ease of visual comparison , territories are split into 12 geographical regions -- e.g. blue for @entity62 , brown for @entity64 -- and shading marks out specific countries			0
the range of subjects is impressive , from greenhouse gas emissions , wealth and disease to more obscure data about numbers of dentists and working tractors			1
@entity76 , research assistant at @entity36 and part of the team working on the project , told @entity2 : " i think the maps of disease are particularly shocking and bring home the scale of the problem in @entity64 better than a table of statistics does			1
" indeed , the map of malaria deaths is striking : 94 percent of deaths from malaria occur in @entity64 , making the continent appear like a vast bloated blob			0
the rest of the world is reduced to a disparate series of veiny streaks			0
there are other sobering statistics to consider			0
in june 2008 , @entity98 spoke to @entity99 at @entity100 about strategies to eradicate poverty			2
@entity103 talked about the education being crucial to breaking the cycle of poverty , particularly for girls			2
the new atlas 's girls not at @entity111 cartogram graphically illustrates the lack of female education in many parts of the developing world			2
team members are currently working on a map of languages and soon hope to be producing animated maps			1
" we have a series of maps that show deaths at various stages , which would be particularly suited to an animation , and we now have a phd student looking at extending the web site , including ways of mapping flow			1

the @entity15 brings economic , social and environmental data to life
366 cartograms include vivid data on disease , wealth , poverty and the environment
team are extending the collection with maps of language and developing animations
