@entity0 thought its nightmare was over -- but perhaps it 's only just beginning			2
after the humiliation of being obliterated by @entity7 , those who had dreamed of a @entity5 @entity4 triumph might have thought they would be left alone to quietly lick their words or perhaps console themselves with a sombre walk along the shores of the @entity13			2
alas , such a luxury will not be afforded to them -- not now at least			0
instead neighbors @entity17 will launch an invasion of @entity19 hoping to start their own party in its arch rival 's back yard			1
this was the result which @entity0 feared -- the scenario it never wanted to face , to have @entity17 , its oldest foe , walk out at the @entity26 on sunday just 90 minutes away becoming world champions			1
while @entity0 had leaked goals in its shambolic defeat by @entity7 , @entity17 displayed true grit and then calm under pressure in a penalty shootout to book its place in the @entity4 final for the first time in 24 years -- the fifth in its history			1
do n't bother telling those with their faces painted blue and white that was a tepid and insipid encounter			0
they 're probably still jumping up and down with joy -- while celebrating @entity45 @entity44 like never before			0
" i 'm very happy because we reached the final and now we will see what we can do , " @entity17 coach @entity46 told reporters			1
" we will give everything as usual , with humility , work and 100 % effort			0
" a goalless 120 minutes was enough to bore most to tears but when @entity56 struck the decisive penalty kick to win the shootout 4 - 2 , the march to @entity19 began and @entity0 closed its eyes			1
for the third time , @entity17 will play @entity7 in the final having won in 1986 and lost in 1990 -- but regardless of the opposition , it will surely need to improve on this performance			1
@entity64 , the man who has inspired @entity17 on so many occasions , was almost anonymous but he was not the only one to disappear			2
this game was a case of going from the sublime to the ridiculous as the sequel to @entity7 's dominant display over @entity0 was temporarily forgotten as these two sides served up one of the poorest offerings of the tournament			1
it was dire -- so dire you had to keep pinching yourself that this was actually a @entity4 semifinal			2
for all the talent on the field , the inability to keep possession , deliver a cross or even manage a simple pass proved beyond those on show			0
often such games are classed as ' intriguing ' , ' tactical ' or ' chess like ' but none of those descriptions fitted -- file this under dreadful and error - strewn			2
neither side deserved to win and penalties looked the most likely outcome from the offset -- a stark contrast to @entity7 's 7 - 1 thrashing of @entity0 on tuesday			1
while the goals flowed like @entity98 in the bars of @entity100 , @entity96 provided a far more sober affair			0
tight , tense and turgid in the first half , both sides struggled to create a chance of note with space at a premium			0
@entity64 , so often @entity17 's leading light , fizzed a free kick at goal which @entity111 did well to save , while @entity113 's header flew just over the crossbar as the @entity116 side briefly threatened			1
@entity64 , making his 92nd international appearance , found himself accompanied by @entity118 each and every time he moved , touched the ball or dared to breathe			0
previously ruled out of the tournament with a groin injury only to make a miraculous recovery in time for the contest , @entity121 gave the @entity126 the bite in midfield which it had missed in the quarterfinal victory over @entity130			2
but while the @entity126 side was relatively untroubled in defense , it rarely threatened going forward with @entity134 and @entity135 almost anonymous			0
@entity134 , one of the outstanding players of the tournament , touched the ball just six times in the opening 45 minutes as @entity17 , and @entity141 in particular , kept the flying @entity126 quiet			1
if anybody had hoped that the fare might improve after the interval they were left sorely disappointed			0
passes went astray , possession was squandered with both teams failing to provide any trace of quality in the final third			0
and yet with the contest at 90 minutes , the @entity126 had the opportunity to win the tie in the most dramatic fashion as they attempted to reach a second successive final			1
@entity158 , anonymous for much of the evening , produced a fine flick to release @entity134 but the @entity161 man dallied and allowed @entity141 time to recover and block his effort			0
with neither side able to muster a goal , the tie moved into extra time with the @entity126 appearing the more threatening			0
@entity134 's low effort forced @entity169 into a routine save in an otherwise unremarkable opening 15 minutes of extra time			2
@entity17 , impotent for much of the contest with @entity64 superbly marshalled by the @entity126 defense , rarely looked capable of finding a winner			1
but with five minutes of the tie remaining , it created its best chance of the contest when @entity56 played in @entity176 , but his header was easily dealt with by @entity111			2
penalties ensued somewhat inevitably and it was @entity17 which held its nerve with goalkeeper romero the hero			1
the @entity126 , which had defeated @entity130 on penalties in the previous round following the introduction of substitute goalkeeper @entity185 , floundered under the pressure			0
@entity187 , one of the game 's outstanding performers , was thwarted by @entity169 , who also saved from @entity158			0
in the end it was left to @entity56 to fire @entity17 into the final and get the party started -- a party which @entity0 is n't invited to and one it hoped it would never have to see .			1
