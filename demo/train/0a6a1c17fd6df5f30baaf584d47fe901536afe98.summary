-- " @entity1 enjoys a far higher degree of press freedom than before the handover in 1997 and this is on par with the most developed places in the world , " said @entity1 secretary for home affairs , @entity9 , to the @entity10 last november			1
@entity9 was urging council members to vote down a motion defending press freedom in the territory , put forth by the @entity16 's @entity15 amid growing concern about @entity19 's influence on @entity1 's media			1
in fact , he sounded like a mainland official citing instances of ' good deeds ' when rebutting criticism against @entity19 's human rights record			2
such claims contrast sharply with the reality in @entity1 , where the free flow and access to information has been gradually but steadily restricted following @entity1 's return to @entity19 sovereignty on july 1 , 1997			1
although freedom of the press is enshrined in @entity1 's de facto constitution , the @entity37 , the gap has been shrinking between our city and mainland @entity19 , which does not enjoy freedom of expression			1
@entity1 - is it still special 15 years later ? in @entity1 , the proliferation of media outlets does not tell the whole story			2
the figures are robust : a city of seven million people consuming 46 daily newspapers and 642 periodicals as of 2010 , according to the @entity51			0
nonetheless , the large number of media outlets does not ensure a diversity of voices , which is a fundamental part of press freedom			1
according to an industry survey conducted by the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) in april , nearly 87 % of the 663 journalists who responded said press freedom in @entity1 has deteriorated since 2005 when @entity9 took office as chief executive			1
this builds upon a similar survey conducted by the @entity58 in 2007 , in which 58.4 % of journalists felt press freedom had been eroded since the 1997 handover			1
the results confirmed a worrying trend in the media industry			0
more than 92 % of respondents in this latest survey found the government 's tight grip on the flow of information has now surpassed self - censorship as the main mode of eroding press freedom			1
in many ways , the government now controls what information can be reported , and which images and soundbites can be used			2
the media have been blocked from many coverage opportunities and forced to rely more on official press materials			0
the government has increasingly resorted to holding press briefings , where information presented there may be attributed only to " anonymous " government sources			2
in one recent example , a population policy report was presented at a @entity96 lunch by chief secretary @entity97			0
a closed - door briefing was held , during which no audio or video recording was allowed			0
the full report was also not provided to the media , who were told to find it on the government 's website			1
the tightening of information sources by the government has more significance in @entity1 than elsewhere because there is not a multi-party system in place			1
the governing party is the only source of official information , and it allows only manipulated information to trickle out into the public domain			0
more worrying are the reports of rough treatment being meted out to reporters on the ground			0
at the july 1 march last year -- an annual display of public wrath against the destruction of democracy -- at least 19 frontline reporters were pepper - sprayed and one was unreasonably arrested			0
in august , media access to a three - day visit by @entity19 vice-premier @entity131 was mostly denied , with the press area located far away from the official ceremony			1
there are also tight restrictions on movement in the vicinity of the new government offices in @entity139 , making it impossible to freely conduct interviews			0
but what is more damaging for press freedom is the increased self - censorship among journalists			1
in the @entity58 survey conducted in april , 79.2 % of respondents said self - censorship now is more serious than at the start of @entity9 's term in 2005			1
many observers in @entity1 claim @entity153 's liaison office made tremendous efforts to help the new chief - executive leung chun - ying win his position in the april elections			2
three days before the vote , the @entity159 newspaper distorted the opinion column of veteran commentator , @entity163 , to support @entity165 's candidacy			0
@entity163 had rejected both candidates in his piece , which was altered without his consent to , " out of the two , i would rather choose @entity155			0
" sing @entity173 's editor - in - chief , @entity172 , admitted the alteration was made to conform with front - page coverage supporting @entity165			2
nonetheless , @entity163 's column was dropped completely from the paper shortly afterward , following a piece on the passing of mainland dissident @entity180 in @entity182 exile			0
the structural factors of journalistic self - censorship are reinforced when @entity1 media outlets are owned by listed companies that have an eye on mainland @entity19 's enormous market			1
over half of their owners and major stakeholders are appointed as delegates to the @entity194 or members of the @entity196			0
this conflict of interest leads to unfavorable coverage of the @entity19 government being cut			2
criticism of conglomerates that wield strong influence over advertising , and news detrimental to media owners ' interests are downplayed			0
last month , the english - language @entity209 's reduction of a 25 - cm - long story to a mere 100 - word brief on the questionable death of mainland dissident @entity214 on the day the story broke aroused allegations of self - censorship from both its employees and the media industry			1
the newly - promoted editor - in - chief , @entity220 , who is a member of the @entity221 , provided a weak defence in an official statement , arguing that he " chose not to prioritize coverage on the first day it broke until more facts and details surrounding the circumstances of this case could be established			0
" the @entity209 only gave wider coverage to the incident after the local @entity19 media gave it extensive coverage , and 25,000 people took to the streets to demand a thorough investigation into @entity131 's death			2
it seems the newspaper does not want be seen as lagging behind the ethos of @entity1			0
read about @entity1 's mass protest on july 1 press freedom in @entity1 is endangered and while efforts should start from us journalists , we need a collective effort to turn the tide			1
this latest controversy shows that mass social pressure may be an effective way to ward off self - censorship			1
the @entity19 authorities could not immediately be reached for comment			0
join us on @entity253 / @entity252 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity256 .			0

@entity258 has steadily eroded in @entity1 since city 's return to @entity19 sovereignty
survey shows nearly 87 % of journalists say press freedom in @entity1 has deteriorated
government 's grip on flow of information is main form of eroding press freedom
increased self - censorship is most dangerous form of declining press freedom
