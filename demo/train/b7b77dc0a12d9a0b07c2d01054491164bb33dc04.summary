-- enhanced screening procedures for @entity4 - bound air passengers traveling through " state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest " such as @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 amount to religious profiling of @entity14 , the @entity1 said monday			1
the @entity15 announced the strengthened security steps sunday , saying that " effective aviation security must begin beyond our borders			2
" a senior government official , not authorized to speak on the record , provided @entity0 with the list of 14 countries subject to the enhanced screening for travelers heading to the @entity4 : @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity11 , @entity9 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity10			1
the new guidelines target 13 muslim - majority nations and will " disproportionately target @entity4 muslims who have family or spiritual ties to the @entity42 world , " the @entity1 said , adding that the tougher measures " amount to religious and ethnic profiling			1
" " under these new guidelines , almost every @entity48 who travels to see family or friends or goes on pilgrimage to @entity53 will automatically be singled out for special security checks -- that 's profiling , " said @entity46 , the council 's national executive director			1
" while singling out travelers based on religion and national origin may make some people feel safer , it only serves to alienate and stigmatize @entity14 and does nothing to improve airline security			1
" a @entity15 spokesperson , @entity62 , responded that " @entity15 does not profile			0
" " as is always the case , @entity15 security measures are based on threat , not ethnic or religious background , " @entity63 said			0
the tougher measures followed a botched bombing attempt on christmas day by a @entity11 man who boarded a @entity4 - bound flight in @entity71 , @entity72			1
the suspect , @entity73 , originated his trip in @entity11 and changed planes in @entity71 to a @entity77 flight headed for @entity78 , @entity79			0
on the flight 's final approach , the suspect allegedly attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear			0
the attempt failed , and the suspect was grabbed by other passengers and crew members			1
@entity4 officials said the suspect received training and help for the attack from @entity91 in @entity10 , one of the countries of origin on the list for enhanced screening			1
a senior @entity98 official , who could not speak on the record because of the sensitive nature of the material , said sunday the countries on the list are places " where we have concerns , particularly about @entity91 affiliates			2
" the official said the @entity98 was heavily involved in compiling the list , along with the @entity108 and other intelligence agencies			2
the @entity98 compiles the annual " @entity114 " report , which details terrorism trends in countries around the world			2
passengers from other countries could still face enhanced security for other reasons			2
@entity46 said the suspicious behavior of @entity73 in the failed @entity121 bombing case , rather than his religion or ethnicity , should have alerted authorities			0
for example , @entity46 said , @entity73 paid cash for his ticket and boarded without checking in baggage			0
improved monitoring of such anomalies is the solution , said @entity46 , who called for increased spending " to obtain more bomb - sniffing dogs , to install more sophisticated bomb - detection equipment and to train security personnel in identifying the behavior suspects			0
" the @entity138 issued a similar statement on monday that called profiling an ineffective strategy			1
" singling out travelers from a few specified countries for enhanced screening is essentially a pretext for racial profiling , which is ineffective , unconstitutional and violates @entity4 values , " said @entity141 , national security policy counsel with the @entity138 's @entity143 legislative office			1
" empirical studies of terrorists show there is no terrorist profile , and using a profile that does n't reflect this reality will only divert resources by having government agents target innocent people			0
profiling also can be " counterproductive by undermining community support for government counterterrorism efforts and creating an injustice that terrorists can exploit to justify further acts of terrorism , " @entity141 said			1
a federal counterterrorism official said the new @entity15 security directive lacked an expiration date , meaning it was intended to be " sustainable and long term			0
" the directive , issued to domestic and international air carriers , states that any individual flying into the @entity4 who is " traveling from or through nations that are state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest will be required to go through enhanced screening			1
" the @entity15 did not elaborate on what those enhanced security procedures might entail			0
in addition , the directive also keeps in place a mandate issued after the attempted @entity121 attack giving pilots discretion to prevent passengers from keeping pillows and blankets on their laps during certain international flights , the official said			2
also retained is the option for pilots to limit movement in the cabin on those international flights			0
@entity0 's @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this report .			0
