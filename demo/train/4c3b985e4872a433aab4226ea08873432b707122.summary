for a country that ditched monarchical rule , @entity0 has some of the most intriguing " castles " in the world			1
ok , maybe not castles in the classic sense			0
to visit a fortress where ancient monarchs slept on stone pillows and knights bickered about grails , you 'll still have to fly across the pond			0
but for a different sort of castle -- the kind redefined by @entity17 names such as @entity18 and @entity19 , by proud @entity21 monarchs or by the occasional heartbroken @entity24 - @entity23 stonemason -- the @entity0 is home to a melting pot of historic domiciles that would blow an 11th - century @entity29 king 's mind			1
here we crown seven favorites whose gates are open to gaping plebeians			0
king of cottages : the @entity36 ( @entity37 , @entity38 ) story : in 1893 @entity40 , heir to the @entity41 , commissioned @entity42 to design this palatial summer home inspired by 16th - century @entity45 palazzos			1
the largest and grandest of @entity37 's famous " cottages " ( colossal leisure homes erected by @entity0 's turn - of - the - century baron class ) , the @entity36 was created in just a few years by a team of 2,500 craftsmen from around the world			1

over the next 28 years , the eccentric @entity24 - @entity0 artisan would -- as a testimony to lost love , it 's been said -- dedicate his life to single - handedly sculpting a massive castellated compound comprised of locally harvested coral rock			1
now on the @entity158 , the place has been called " @entity165 " and still leaves engineers wondering how a short , 100 - pound fellow with a fourth grade education did all this using homemade hand tools and unrequited love			0
@entity166 : within its eight - foot - high , three - foot - thick walls , @entity140 uses approximately 1,100 tons of coral rock -- including a stone sculpture garden with @entity171 - style furniture ( 500 - pound rocking chairs that work ) , a nine - ton gate that moves with ease and a home - carved @entity176 telescope			1
