-- place a tennis ball into a yellow sock and tuck it into the back of your pants			0
congratulations ! you are a snitch			0
do n't get caught , or the game ends			0
this is quidditch , as played by muggles			2
in @entity13 's novels , the snitch is a sort - of magical , winged squash ball , pursued by " seeker " @entity16 in a variety of high - stakes , airborne quidditch contests			1
nobody on the @entity22 campus has a magical , winged squash ball			1
a man with a tennis ball dangling from his shorts will have to do			0
" the snitch is the surrealist aspect of the game , " concedes @entity27 , former @entity22 quidditch player and star of a fly - on - the - wall documentary about his sport			1
@entity35 -- a title taken from the novels ' derogatory term for wizards with non-magical parents -- explores the result when you take a fictional sport and make it real			1
in 2005 , eight years after the publication of the first @entity16 book , @entity46 's @entity45 gave birth to " muggle quidditch , " which translates @entity13 's imaginary sport into our world			1
nobody can fly , but a broom between the legs remains mandatory			0
three circular goals are used at each end of the field , as per the books			0
ten points are scored for getting the " quaffle " ( a volleyball ) through those hoops , and 30 for catching the snitch			0
where magical " bludgers " are unavailable , they are replaced by dodgeballs thrown at rival players			1
finally , and unusually , both magical and muggle quidditch are mixed - gender , full - contact sports			1
becoming real the intrigue for many viewers of @entity76 will be seeing how this sport works , and discovering who wants to play a sport so closely associated with the world of fantasy fiction			1
" it 's hard to be taken seriously when people think you 're a bunch of geeks , " @entity82 is heard to say as the documentary begins			1
players , some of whom have never actually read the @entity16 books , lament the disdain of athletes from other college sports			1
training sessions attract intrigued crowds wielding camera phones			0
filmmaker @entity98 , who raised almost $ 27,000 on @entity99 to make the documentary , says : " if anybody actually watched it or played it , they would realize the amount of athleticism and mental dexterity it takes to play this sport			1
" therein lies the dilemma for quidditch : how to take its next step and , like a sporting @entity114 , become a real boy			1
originally conceived as a light - hearted distraction for college students , the sport is easily looked down upon for its wizarding roots			1
yet quidditch has almost surprised itself by creating groups of elite , dedicated , and athletic players across the @entity124			1
ten thousand fans turned up to the last @entity126			1
nine years since the first official game , there is now a governing body -- @entity124 @entity130 -- with five full - time staff , led by commissioner @entity132			1
" we have 170 college club teams around the country , and most of them are official club sports who receive funding , " @entity132 tells @entity0			1
" teams are increasingly competitive			2
players have to go to tryouts and have mandatory practices			2
" at college level , the sport is stronger than ever			2
on top of that , the first generations of college players are graduating and taking quidditch into the wider world			1
those graduates are finding each other and forming what the sport calls community teams , those clubs created beyond the bounds of college			1
" @entity162 teams have grown significantly and they 're starting to get very good , " says @entity132			2
@entity163 , another former @entity22 player depicted as the team 's driving force in @entity166 , adds : " i would n't be surprised if , in the next half a decade , there was a separate league formed for community teams			1
" they 're going to become these all - star teams			2
" ' completely unique ' yet for some people , this was supposed to be " whimsical , grass - roots quidditch , " as @entity132 calls it			1
now , @entity163 is talking " all - star teams			2
" can a sport inspired by @entity16 really turn into a professional athletic endeavor ? " there are obviously moments where you can be nostalgic for how it started , " says @entity132			1
" there are certain core elements you do n't want to change , ever -- the fact that it 's co-ed , full - contact , is completely unique and that can really change the way people look at gender			1
" but it 's important that the league is always developing , and there 's something really impressive about the idea of taking this from a book and growing it into a professional and legitimate sports entity			2
" somewhere down the line , a professional league would be really cool			0
" each player interviewed by @entity0 brought up the word " legitimacy			0
" " it 's not unique to quidditch , " says @entity204			2
" there are a lot of sports that people do n't really consider to be ' sport '			2
" there 's a narrow definition of sport that has a lot of things tied to it -- are the athletes paid millions of dollars ? is it televised ? sport is legitimized in different ways			2
" i have n't met one person who has played quidditch and said , ' this is n't a sport			2
' all it takes is one or two games on that broom and you 're exhausted			0
" for some observers , the idea of a " snitch " with a ball dangling from their pants , running across campus to evade capture , stops quidditch being taken seriously			2
' people and respect ' by contrast , @entity204 argues that is precisely why quidditch deserves recognition : it has something new to offer			0
" the snitch is what sets quidditch apart from other sports			0
it makes you question what is important to you , " he says , adding that games are often won or lost thanks to highly contentious decisions regarding who did , or did not , catch the snitch			0
" you are going to lose on [ unfair ] snitch catches , " he continues			0
" so are you playing to win , or are you playing because you love this sport and your teammates and you think it 's awesome ? it makes you question what the entire point of doing these things is			2
" one of the big problems we have in sport right now is that it has become so much about the winning , and paying the people who win , that it has stopped being human in a lot of aspects			0
" that 's why you 're seeing a lot of domestic violence cases in the @entity281 , that 's why you 're seeing so much corruption in sports and sports industries			0
it 's this whole , ugly scene			0
" that 's what i like about quidditch -- it is about teams , people , and respect			1
" @entity163 , who played alongside @entity204 at @entity22 , hopes quidditch can hold on to its origins while maturing into a sport that 's more high - performance , and less @entity298			1
" there are two camps , two mindsets , " says the 23 - year - old , now an assistant editor at pc gamer			0
" one is it should continue being this fun , open thing			0
the other is it is this aggressive sport that should be treated as such			0
i think it should do both			0
" we should continue fostering that competitive environment because there are real athletes who really want to compete in this brand - new sport			1
" but we also need to foster the ability for anyone to play			0
not everybody has six hoops and 14 brooms in their back yard			0
the barrier to entry for quidditch is quite high			0
" my hope is it becomes a competitive league on one side , and people doing this in the park on the other			0
i think the sport needs both sides to survive			0
