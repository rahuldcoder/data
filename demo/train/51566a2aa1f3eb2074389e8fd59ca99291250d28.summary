-- a @entity1 and suspected serial rapist pleaded not guilty this week to raping and murdering 19 - year - old college student @entity3			1
the family of @entity3 launched a web site dedicated to her memory after her death in 2008			2
@entity9 , 27 , is charged with first - degree murder , kidnapping and sexual assault in the disappearance of @entity14 , who was last seen alive on her friend 's sofa in @entity18 , @entity19 , january 20 , 2008			1
the construction worker entered his plea in @entity22 on wednesday			0
judge @entity23 set a tentative trial date for february 22 , 2010 , according to online court records			1
@entity14 , a sophomore at @entity26 in @entity27 , was visiting friends in her hometown of @entity18 when she disappeared			1
three weeks later , her body was found in a field near her friend 's home , partially covered with snow			1
an autopsy determined she had been sexually assaulted and strangled			0
a pair of panties that were not hers also were found near the body , in what police said was a " calling card " that helped them connect @entity9 not only to @entity14 , but also to another sexual assault			1
in a press conference after @entity9 's arrest in december , police said they were able to connect the former @entity1 's @entity49 with a sample on the panties			1
police also found @entity49 matching @entity9 's on the rear door of the off - campus house where @entity14 was staying with friends			1
the sample also matched @entity49 found at the scene of a december 16 sexual assault , police said			0
the victim , a student at the @entity60 , was able to escape her attacker and describe him in detail , police say			2
both crimes bear a striking resemblance to several other sexual assaults in the area , leading police to believe that @entity9 is a serial rapist			2
they are asking other possible victims to come forward			0
the case went unsolved for almost 10 months until an anonymous tip from a friend of @entity9 's former girlfriend broke this cold case wide open , police said			1
investigators had established that the killer was from the @entity18 area and had an unusual fetish of collecting one victim 's underwear and leaving it at the next victim 's crime scene			1
the tipster caught investigators ' attention by telling them that @entity9 's former girlfriend had found two pairs of thong panties in his truck			1
detectives immediately followed up on the tip and , with permission from the former girlfriend , took dna samples from @entity9 's 4 - year - old son			2
lab tests showed that the boy 's father -- @entity9 -- was almost certainly a match for the dna found on the doorknob and at the crime scene , police said			2
the finding was confirmed when @entity9 was arrested and ordered to submit dna samples			0
an overnight session at the crime lab confirmed the match , and charges were filed , police said			0
investigators said they since have learned that @entity9 was familiar with the grounds of the university , having worked there on a construction job last year			0
police say his work on campus put him in a position to easily target women			0
when first questioned about the @entity14 case in early november , @entity9 refused to submit dna samples and provided an alibi to police , saying he 'd been with his girlfriend			1
the girlfriend denies that he was with her the night @entity14 disappeared , investigators said			0
calls to @entity9 's public defenders friday were not answered			2
meanwhile , investigators are certain there are other victims who have n't come forward			0
police are urging anyone with more information to call the @entity135 at 775 - 322 - 4900			0
@entity0 's @entity136 and @entity137 contributed to this report .			0
