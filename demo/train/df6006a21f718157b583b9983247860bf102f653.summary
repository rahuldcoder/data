-- president @entity1 should use the breathing space provided by the fiscal - cliff compromise to address some of the issues that he shelved during his last term			1
one of the most urgent is child farm labor			1
perhaps the least protected , underpaid work force in @entity11 labor , children are often the go - to workers for farms looking to cut costs			1
it 's easy to see why			0
the @entity15 permits farms to pay employees under 20 as little as $ 4.25 per hour			2
( by comparison , the federal minimum wage is $ 7.25			0
) and unlike their counterparts in retail and service , child farm laborers can legally work unlimited hours at any hour of day or night			1
the numbers are hard to estimate , but between direct hiring , hiring through labor contractors , and off - the - books work beside parents or for cash , perhaps 400,000 children , some as young as 6 , weed and harvest for commercial farms			1
a @entity34 2010 study shows that children laboring for hire on farms routinely work more than 10 hours per day			1
as if this were not bad enough , few labor safety regulations apply			0
children 14 and older can work long hours at all but the most dangerous farm jobs without their parents ' consent , if they do not miss school			1
children 12 and older can too , as long as their parents agree			0
unlike teen retail and service workers , agricultural laborers 16 and older are permitted to operate hazardous machinery and to work even during school hours			2
in addition , @entity34 reports that child farm laborers are exposed to dangerous pesticides ; have inadequate access to water and bathrooms ; fall ill from heat stroke ; suffer sexual harassment ; experience repetitive - motion injuries ; rarely receive protective equipment like gloves and boots ; and usually earn less than the minimum wage			1
@entity66 is being done to guarantee their safety			0
in 2011 secretary of labor @entity69 proposed more stringent agricultural labor rules for children under 16 , but @entity1 scrapped them just eight months later			1
adoption of the new rules would be no guarantee of enforcement , however			0
according to the 2010 @entity34 report , the @entity15 employees were spread so thin that , despite widespread reports of infractions they found only 36 child labor violations and two child hazardous order violations in agriculture nationwide			2
this lack of oversight has dire , sometimes fatal , consequences			0
last july , for instance , 15 - year - old @entity88 , an employee at a small family farm near @entity90 , @entity91 , died when he fell off the piece of heavy farm equipment he was operating , and it crushed him			0
according to the @entity98 @entity97 , he was the fifth child in fewer than two years to die at work on @entity101 farms			1
if this year follows trends , @entity88 will be only one of at least 100 children below the age of 18 killed on @entity11 farms , not to mention the 23,000 who will be injured badly enough to require hospital admission			0
according to @entity110 statistics , agriculture is one of the most dangerous industries			0
it is the most dangerous for children , accounting for about half of child worker deaths annually			0
the @entity11 has a long tradition of training children in the craft of farming on family farms			2
at least 500,000 children help to work their families ' farms today			2
farm parents , their children , and the @entity127 objected strenuously to the proposed new rules			2
although children working on their parents ' farms would specifically have been exempted from them , it was partly in response to worries about government interference in families and loss of opportunities for children to learn agricultural skills that the @entity1 administration shelved them			1
whatever you think of family farms , however , many child agricultural workers do n't work for their parents or acquaintances			1
despite exposure to all the hazards , these children never learn the craft of farming , nor do most of them have the legal right to the minimum wage			0
and until the economy stabilizes , the savings farms realize by hiring children makes it likely that even more of them will be subject to the dangers of farm work			1
we have a responsibility for their safety			0
as one of the first acts of his new term , @entity1 should reopen the child agricultural labor proposal he shelved in spring of 2012			1
surely , farm labor standards for children can be strengthened without killing off @entity169 or @entity170			1
second , the @entity15 must institute age , wage , hour and safety regulations that meet the standards set by retail and service industry rules			2
children in agriculture should not be exposed to more risks , longer hours , and lower wages at younger ages than children in other jobs			0
finally , the @entity15 and the @entity184 must allocate the funds necessary for meaningful enforcement of child labor violations			1
unenforced rules wo n't protect the nearly million other children who work on farms			2
agriculture is a great @entity11 tradition			0
let 's make sure it 's not one our children have to die for			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			0

@entity199 : @entity1 should strengthen child farm labor standards
she says @entity205 rules allow kids to work long hours for little pay on commercial farms
she says @entity1 administration scrapped @entity205 chief 's proposal for *tightening* rules
she says @entity205 must fix *lax* standards for kid labor on farmers ; @entity184 must enforce them
