the photo shows a young man , his hair short and his eyes looking at the ground as he walks out of a car			1
the only thing he 's wearing above the waist is a necklace -- unless you count his tattoos and the handcuffs behind his back			2
most of @entity17 first saw his face and learned his name thursday , when @entity21 police announced the 19 - year - old 's arrest in connection to what they called a road rage incident february 12 that ended with a mother of four mortally wounded by a gunshot			1
but at least for a brief period two years ago , @entity15 seemingly had no qualms about putting himself out there on social media			1
the profile photo on what appears to be his @entity37 page , last updated in january 2013 , shows him with his tongue wagging , his hand tattooed , with a ballcap on his head and thick chain around his neck			2
he 's holding what appears to be a wad of cash , including at least one $ 100 bill			2
@entity51 's apparent @entity50 profile is from around the same time ; the last posts were in march 2013			1
it has a clear theme , though , with the majority of pictures showing marijuana in its various forms and some of the teenager seemingly smoking it			1
the header for that page ? @entity63			2
it 's not clear how any of his past led to @entity15 's arrest thursday , one week after his neighbor @entity64 was shot			1
it could have nothing to do with it ; authorities have not pinpointed a motive or state of mind in the alleged road rage incident and shooting , or during @entity15 's later short - lived standoff with police			1
still , @entity80 ' husband , @entity79 , said that he and others knew about @entity15 before this happened , and what they knew was n't good			1
" we knew how bad he was , " @entity80 told reporters			2
" but we did n't know it was this bad			2
" @entity15 spent friday in the @entity87 on charges of murder , attempted murder and discharging a gun from a vehicle in a prohibited area			1
he 's set to have his first day in court on monday			2
it was unclear thursday night whether @entity15 had an attorney ; court documents detailing his charges did n't list a lawyer			1
and his distraught mother was n't talking , turning away reporters			2
police are looking for another suspect			0
but they believe it was @entity15 who shot @entity64 soon after she 'd gotten out of her car outside her @entity21 home , about a block from his own home			1
twists , turns in deadly @entity21 case authorities believe the shooting stemmed from an earlier encounter with a man who they say drove sped past her as she was returning home after giving her 15 - year - old daughter a driving lesson			1
the daughter honked the horn , prompting the car to stop			0
a man got out of the car and confronted them			0
@entity80 told @entity129 's @entity128 that the man threatened to kill his wife and daughter			0
@entity64 returned home , dropped off her daughter and picked up her 22 - year - old son , who was armed			0
the mother and son then drove away and tracked down a man thought to be @entity15 , only to lose sight of him			1
soon after , a car showed up in the @entity80 ' cul - de - sac			0
the family has said there were three people in the car			0
the son told police that he and his mother were fired upon , and he shot back			0
@entity64 was shot once in the head			0
she died two days later , on @entity149			0
she was 44 years old			0
that was the extent of what authorities knew about the back - and - forth between @entity153 and @entity64 until thursday , according to @entity21 police capt. @entity154			1
it was then that @entity80 first told reporters that @entity15 and his wife had known each other for some time			1
his wife had spent " countless hours at the park consoling this boy , " he said			0
" she was really good to him			0
she fed him , she gave him money			1
" she told him to pull his pants up and to be a man , " @entity80 added			0
" more times than i can count			0
" @entity1 's @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .			0

@entity15 , 19 , faces murder and 2 other charges tied to incidents in @entity21
the *victim* had consoled , fed and *provided* for @entity180 well before incident , her husband says
his apparent social media pages show him with marijuana and money
