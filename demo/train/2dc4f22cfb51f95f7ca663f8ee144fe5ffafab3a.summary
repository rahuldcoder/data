-- we 're in the thick of the @entity3 @entity2 , and all the ugly old stereotypes are being deployed as shorthand for one very beautiful state			1
you know , the characterization of @entity3 as a swamp of sleazy politics and brutal attack ads , a @entity13 bastion of rednecks and racism , a state defined by @entity17			1
sometimes these stereotypes are floated in political conversation as evidence of how " real " the state is in determining the true feelings of the conservative base			1
yes , @entity3 is conservative -- especially compared with @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			0
but it is complex and constantly evolving , containing one of the oldest cities in @entity30 and a growing population , especially along the coastline			0
my family moved there when i was 14 , and we love the state -- and especially the elegant , functional and lyrical city of @entity39 -- with the zeal of the converted			0
for my parents , it is home			0
so below are three stubborn stereotypes about @entity3 that need to be confronted with facts			1
this is n't @entity48 's state anymore @entity3 is sometimes stereotyped as a lonely bastion of rural white social conservatives			1
in fact , the state is nearly 30 % @entity53 -- more than double the national average			1
an influx of immigrants from other states and retirees looking for a better quality of life have helped transform the state over the past three decades , boosting its population 15 % in the past decade alone			2
most of this growth has happened on the coastline -- especially around @entity39 , @entity66 and @entity67 -- and the booming @entity70 - @entity69 metro area in the @entity71			0
thanks to a combination of @entity73 to work laws and reduced tax burden , major manufacturing companies have relocated plants to the state , including @entity79 and @entity80			0
nearly 60 % of the state population lives in cities , towns or suburbs -- and just more than 40 % of the state was born elsewhere			1
" people do n't take into account the general migration of wealthy , well - educated , generally successful retirees and their families to @entity3 and the @entity93 in general in the last two decades , " attests @entity86 , former managing editor of the @entity87			1
this influx also makes for more in - state political diversity than is commonly understood			0
longtime @entity39 mayor @entity96 is a @entity97 who recently won his 10th term in a nonpartisan election			0
@entity102 @entity101 whip @entity100 also hails from the state			0
but perhaps the ultimate symbol of how @entity3 has changed is @entity30 rep. @entity105 , an @entity107 conservative who defeated former sen. @entity48 's son in a 2010 primary to represent the @entity111 , where the @entity112 started			2
@entity17 does n't represent the state yes , there are many social conservatives and evangelicals in @entity3 -- especially in the @entity71 , near controversial @entity17			1
but they are seen more as a local curiosity than a real barometer of statewide opinion -- small businesses and the beach and hunting culture define day - to - day life in @entity3 more than the @entity13			1
sixty - percent of @entity125 primary voters identified as evangelical four years ago , but that 's the same percentage as the @entity128 caucuses			1
and while just 11 % of @entity128 caucus - goers identified as moderate , in @entity3 that number grows to 24 %			1
finally , do n't forget that @entity131 won the @entity3 primary in 2008 , notably without major evangelical support			2
fiscal conservatives and military veterans responded to his message of political reform , a local tradition carried out by sen. @entity139 and former gov. @entity140 -- before he went hiking the @entity141			0
the @entity17 president endorsed @entity143 last time around -- despite maintaining that @entity144 is a cult -- and @entity143 came in fourth			0
gov. @entity146 does n't speak for the @entity147 elected in 2010 , @entity3 gov. @entity146 is a rapidly rising star in national politics			2
it 's easy to see why -- at 39 , she is the first female and the first @entity151 to hold the position of @entity3 governor			2
a tea party favorite in 2010 , her surprisingly narrow election -- 51 % to 47 % was nonetheless a reminder of the reality of the @entity93 , and the growing diversity of the @entity125			0
when she endorsed @entity143 , it was considered big news and the news release headline was dutifully reprinted -- " @entity143 receives @entity147 support in @entity3			0
" but @entity146 's national profile is outstripping her in - state popularity , which stands at 34.6 % , according to a recent @entity167 poll			1
surreally , this makes @entity146 less popular in @entity3 than president @entity169 , who clocks in at 44 % in the same poll and who lost the @entity3 by 9 points in 2008			2
the real leader of the tea party in @entity3 -- and a national force as well -- is sen. @entity176 , and he 's not endorsing any presidential candidate this time around			2
there 's no question that @entity3 is pivotal for the @entity2 presidential nomination -- the winner has been the nominee since 1980			2
but the differences between the @entity3 and the @entity184 primary or @entity128 caucuses should be understood with the proper perspective			1
one of the biggest differences is the state of the local economy -- @entity128 and @entity184 have unemployment rates well below the national average , but in @entity3 the unemployment rate is close to 10 % -- adding to the calculus that @entity195 's @entity194 made when it decided to unleash the @entity197 ad			1
likewise , @entity198 might do well in the state as much for his focus on strengthening @entity30 manufacturing as his much - vaunted social conservative purism			0
and if @entity143 does win the primary , it will be aided in part by the fact that he is the most center - right figure remaining in the @entity2 field			0
as @entity0 heads down to @entity39 for thursday night 's debate , it 's all just a reminder not to fall back on lazy national narratives but instead find the real facts when it comes to the great state of @entity3			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			0

@entity217 : stories refer to @entity3 in no - longer true , if ever , stereotypes
state population is diverse , he says ; it 's 30 % black with a growing immigrant population
@entity217 : @entity17 does n't define the state culturally
unemployment high , he says , but there are more moderates in @entity3 than in @entity128
