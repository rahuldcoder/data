has voted 190 - 18 in favor of impeaching former prime minister @entity4 for her role in a controversial rice subsidy program that cost the country billions			1
though the vote was largely symbolic , as she had already lost her post , it also carries a five - year ban from politics			0
the news came hours after the attorney general 's office announced that @entity4 , who was removed from office in may last year days before the military swept to power in a coup , will face criminal charges over the affair			1
if found guilty , she could face up to 10 years in prison			0
the rice subsidy program , introduced in 2011 , pledged to pay farmers well above the market rate for their crop			1
but critics said it wasted large amounts of public funds trying to please rural voters , hurting exports and leaving the government with large stockpiles of rice it could n't sell without losing money			2
she was eventually put under investigation by @entity1 's @entity40 ( @entity40 )			0
in an address to the @entity0 thursday , @entity4 denied any wrongdoing and questioned whether the impeachment vote was valid			2
" the @entity40 's legitimacy in sending the impeachment case for the @entity0 's consideration is questionable since the @entity47 of 2007 has been revoked ... with the coup d'etat on may 22 , 2014 , " she said			2
" i am no longer prime minister since the constitutional court has already removed me , thus there is essentially no ' position ' to impeach me from			1
" the legal grounds claimed by the @entity40 were also invalid , as the target of impeaching me is to ban me from holding any political positions for five years , which is a clear violation of my fundamental rights and liberties			0
" but the @entity58 reported friday that many @entity0 members were unconvinced and found she was unable to clear up the accusations against her			0
they also backed the @entity40 evidence against her			0
in a statement translated into @entity66 by her office , @entity4 said she would " continue to fight to prove my innocence to the very end , no matter what the outcome will be			1
" she said the rice subsidy scheme was " beneficial for the farmers and the country " and that claims it lost money were wrong and motivated by political bias against her			1
" i am not sad because i am the victim of this entire ordeal , but i am sad for the rice farmers and all of the disadvantaged @entity1 citizens whose lives will return to the vicious cycle of being poor , debt ridden , and being taken advantage of , and most important of all , being denied of their basic democratic rights under the rule of law , " she said			0
two weeks before the military coup last may , a @entity1 court ordered @entity4 's removal , finding her guilty of violating the country 's constitution in her reassignment of a senior security official in 2011			1
that official was replaced by the then - national police chief , whose role in turn was given to @entity100			0
@entity101 is the brother of the ex-wife of @entity104 , @entity4 's brother , who was overthrown as prime minister in a military coup in 2006			1
@entity104 is living in self - imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction .			2
