-- instead of keeping the government running and focusing on the economy and other pressing issues facing the country , the @entity2 leadership has decided to play politics with women 's health and economic stability			1
in its 43rd vote to dismantle the @entity11 , the @entity2 has shut down the government to delay the law 's implementation until 2015			1
it is a desperate attack that could leave millions of people without health coverage			0
but a small group of far - right members of the @entity2 pushed through a provision that goes even further , passing an amendment that would allow employers and insurance companies to refuse to cover women 's preventive health care because they have a personal " moral " objection			1
this would include birth control , hpv testing , breast - feeding services and counseling for domestic violence			1
any employer or insurance company could refuse to cover them , and women would have no recourse			0
it 's a clause that could easily be abused by employers and insurers			0
and the amendment only covers the women 's preventive benefit -- employers would not be able to refuse to cover preventive care specific to men for " moral " reasons			2
but this is from the same @entity2 @entity50 leaders who tried to shut the government down in 2011 over funding for @entity54 's cancer screenings , birth control and other preventive health care services and have tried dozens of times since then to block women from making their own personal medical decisions			1
this unprecedented and ongoing attack on women 's health is out of touch with the needs of millions of women and is deeply unpopular with the @entity66 public			1
seven in 10 @entity66 believe that health insurance companies should cover the full cost of birth control , just as they do for other preventive services			2
already , 27 million women across the country have been able to receive preventive health care without a co-pay , and an estimated 47 million will benefit when the law takes full effect			0
these investments in women 's health services are not only providing women with more control over their health and their own family planning , but they are also a great deal for taxpayers			1
according to research released by the @entity88 this summer , for every $ 1 we invest in birth control services , we save nearly $ 6 in the long term			2
it 's a smart policy for the health of women and for our nation 's economy			0
this is why earlier this year , @entity54 members and our allies submitted more than 350,000 comments to the @entity100 in support of the benefit			0
these comments came from women and men in all 50 states , and we continue to hear from women every day who are already benefiting from birth control with no co-payss			0
we hear from women such as @entity112 of @entity113 , @entity114 , a 23 - year - old who wrote to us to say that she just married " the love of my life " and plans to have children one day -- when she and her new husband are ready			0
they both have " piles of student loans " to pay first , and she can barely afford birth control if it were n't covered			0
@entity112 and others like her will suffer if this narrow group of @entity50 members of @entity127 succeed in their crusade to keep women from having access to birth control and other preventive care			2
although it 's not the first time they 've tried , it 's alarming how far some members of the @entity50 will go to attack the women 's preventive benefit and the @entity11 itself			2
as the leading women 's health care provider and advocate , @entity54 has fought hard to protect this benefit from the beginning because we know that birth control is basic , preventive health care for women , and it is a key economic issue for women and their families			1
the country wants @entity127 to focus on jobs and the economy , not on pushing an extreme agenda against women 's access to health care			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			0

@entity158 : @entity2 took its 43rd vote trying to kill the @entity11
included provision to let employers and insurers refuse women 's health coverage
@entity158 : women could lose coverage for birth control , hpv testing , other services
she says @entity127 should stop pushing an extreme , unpopular agenda and fix economy
