@entity0 , @entity1 -- he may be diminutive in stature as he appears under the shadow of the @entity6 , @entity1 's tallest structure at 634 meters			1
but as he twists and screams " i 'm so pretty ! " onstage , it becomes clear that his star is rising			0
the crowd of thousands goes wild , screaming his name and snapping as many photos as they can			0
" @entity16 " is a superstar in a pear costume			2
in the world of cute , cuddly , and sometimes bizarre mascots , these " yuru - kyara " ( meaning gentle or laid back characters ) , have been a ubiquitous presence in advertising in @entity1 for decades			0
but @entity16 is a hyperactive talking and dancing pear who has distinguished himself from the pack			2
in fact , @entity16 is a household name			0
coming from the northwestern city of @entity29 , known for its delicious pears , @entity16 's origins lie in his @entity32 channel created two years ago			1
the fact that he spoke , jumped , and had a distinctively flamboyant personality made him different from typically quiet and cuddly @entity1 mascots			0
since then , his popularity has exploded , boasting an impressive resume that includes television appearances , commercials and ad campaigns , and even his own novelty single released under @entity45			0
@entity16 's undeniable charisma but what makes @entity16 so different from his countless cohorts of colorful characters ? at first glance , one may think his bright yellow color , sparkling eyes and perpetual smile is nothing new for a country with an army of crazy characters like @entity60 , a white puppy - like mascot from @entity64 city with an upside down ramen bowl on his head , or @entity67 , a creepy ghost - like character from @entity71 prefecture			1
however , the moment @entity16 starts dancing widely and emphatically hyping up the crowd in his high - pitched voice , ending sentences with his catchphrase " nashiiii ! " ( @entity76 ! ) -- this mascot becomes an unforgettable presence			1
while even the most popular mascots in @entity1 like @entity80 , a rosy - cheeked black bear from @entity83 prefecture , are silent and slow moving , @entity16 's unique costume design allows for rapid , energetic movements that he uses to jump up and down to excite and rile up his audience			1
in addition , his ability to speak makes him an interactive and electrifying crowd favorite			1
@entity16 and the iconic @entity1 teddy bear @entity80 are the superstars of the 2014 @entity95 festival , which features mascots from all over @entity1			1
people line up to meet and pose for pictures with their favorite mascots and more importantly , buy their exclusive merchandise that includes everything from handbags , towels , t - shirts , and much more			0
according to the @entity106 , a research firm that studies the character business , mascot - driven character sales amounted to nearly $ 16 billion in @entity1 in 2012			2
replicating the @entity16 effect other prefectures are hoping to replicate @entity16 and @entity80 's enormous commercial success by releasing their own yuru - kyara 's , in an effort to attract regional tourism and land national ad campaigns of their own			0
@entity80 's brand is already expanding overseas , with themed products soon to be appearing in @entity117 convenience stores in @entity118			0
although @entity16 's stardom currently remains limited to @entity1 , it 's not unbelievable to imagine his following expanding worldwide , placing him among the ranks of other @entity1 icons that became multi-billion - dollar icons			1
the creators of @entity80 and @entity16 are hoping for the kind of global fame as @entity1 icons @entity128 and @entity130 .			2
