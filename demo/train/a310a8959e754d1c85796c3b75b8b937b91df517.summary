@entity0 , @entity1 -- police found no " discernible remains " in their search friday for long - missing labor strongman @entity7 , police chief @entity3 said			1
two soil samples taken from beneath a storage shed outside a suburban @entity11 home will nevertheless go to a lab at @entity13 for testing			1
officials are expected to announce by monday night if they 've found evidence bearing out a tipster 's claim that he saw what appeared to be a body being buried at the site the day after the former @entity23 chief disappeared in 1975			1
even if they do , @entity3 said he doubts any remains would be those of @entity7			1
" it would be great if it was , because i would like to bring closure to his family and the tens of thousands of @entity23 that idolize this man , and just the southeast of @entity1 , " said @entity26 , of the @entity27			2
" this is kind of like an open wound that wo n't go away			0
every couple of years this happens , and all you guys come out here and we have to relive it			0
" police broke through a concrete floor beneath a storage shed on the site , then drew two soil samples from the ground as deep as 6 feet down , @entity3 said			1
the results did n't turn up bones , body parts or other evidence , he said			1
he described the samples as merely " murky			0
" while police searched , reporters and curious onlookers milled about on the street outside the home , which reportedly once housed a gambling operation tied to @entity11 's notorious organized crime community			1
police began their inquiry after a tipster came forward in august to say that he believed he 'd witnessed a body being buried at the home			1
the tipster did not come forward sooner out of fear , @entity3 said			0
a search using ground - penetrating radar last month showed some sort of anomaly in the ground beneath the storage shed 's concrete floor , according to police			2
2010 : digging into the @entity7 legend ? the lab tests being conducted on the soil samples will be able to determine if human remains were buried at the site , but will not identify them , @entity3 said			1
if human remains are discovered , investigators would have to return for a more complete excavation , he said			1
@entity82 , author of " the @entity83 , " first spoke to the tipster in march , and sent him to police			2
the tipster , a former gambler , once did business with a man tied to @entity90 , an organized crime figure who was supposed to meet @entity7 the day he disappeared , @entity82 said			1
despite those links , @entity82 said it seems unlikely that anyone would have been buried at the site , in full view of the neighborhood			0
and if a body had been buried there , little would remain , he said			2
" i am very skeptical , " @entity82 said of the search			0
@entity26 is too , but he 's not ruling anything out			0
" the timeline does n't really add up , " he said			0
" but stranger things have happened , so it 's possible			0
" @entity7 's presumed death has vexed investigators for almost four decades			1
one of the most powerful union leaders at a time that unions wielded a great deal of sway over elections -- and were notoriously tied to organized crime -- @entity7 was forced out of the organized labor movement when he went to federal prison in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud			1
president @entity118 pardoned him in 1971 on the condition that he not try to get back into the union movement before 1980			0
two weeks before @entity7 's disappearance , federal investigators discovered hundreds of millions of dollars had been stolen from the @entity23 ' largest pension fund , @entity121 points out in its list of the top 10 most famous disappearances			1
@entity7 , then 62 , was last seen on july 30 , 1975 , at suburban @entity11 restaurant			1
he was there ostensibly to meet with reputed @entity129 street enforcer @entity90 and @entity130 , chief of a @entity23 local in @entity132 , who was later convicted in a murder case			1
both men have since died			0
@entity7 believed @entity90 had set up the meeting to help settle a feud between @entity7 and @entity130 , but @entity7 was the only one who showed up for the meeting , according to the @entity138			2
@entity90 and @entity130 later told the @entity138 that no meeting had been scheduled			0
the @entity138 said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to @entity7 's efforts to regain power in the @entity23 and to the mob 's influence over the union 's pension funds			1
police and the @entity138 have searched for @entity7 intermittently ever since			2
in september 2001 , the @entity138 found dna that linked @entity7 to a car that agents suspected was used in his disappearance			2
in 2004 , authorities removed floorboards from a @entity11 home to look for traces of blood , as former @entity23 official @entity158 claimed in a biography that he had shot @entity7			1
@entity158 had died in 2003			0
investigators ruled that blood found in the house was not @entity7 's			1
the @entity138 has a sample of his dna from a hairbrush			0
two years later , the @entity138 razed a horse barn in @entity1 following what it called " a fairly credible lead			0
" but the disappearance remains unsolved			2
urban lore long suggested that @entity7 was buried around the end zone at the former @entity171 in @entity132			2
as @entity173 puts it , the mystery surrounding @entity7 is not simply a " whodunnit			2
" " the likely suspects are all known , and their motives are well documented			0
the question is : where ? what exactly did they do to @entity7 , and where did they dispose of his body ? " but over the years , numerous theories have been floated			2
in 1987 , @entity186 -- a former @entity7 strong - arm -- and a @entity189 reporter published " @entity190 , " which @entity191 described as " the hair - raising inside story of @entity7			0
" " rather than being kidnapped by rival union forces as law enforcement authorities have long speculated , @entity186 says @entity7 was abducted by two federal agents , " @entity191 reported			0
" he thinks they drove @entity7 to a nearby airport , took off in a small plane , and pushed him out over one of the @entity202			0
@entity186 says he did not tell federal investigators this bizarre , and unverifiable , story because they would not grant him immunity			0
" @entity7 's son , @entity206 , is the current president of the @entity23			1
@entity2 's @entity207 and @entity208 contributed to this report .			0
