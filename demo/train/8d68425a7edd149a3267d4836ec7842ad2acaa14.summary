@entity0 -- a new poll tuesday showed voters are willing to give @entity4 a fresh look now that he is the certain @entity6 presidential nominee , and the former @entity8 governor picked up public backing from the top @entity6 leaders in the @entity11 and @entity12			1
the good news came as @entity4 's campaign offered a mild rebuke to right - wing rocker @entity16 's for his latest inflammatory rhetoric against president @entity18 , seeking a middle ground between condoning divisive language and alienating conservatives who like @entity16 's firebrand politics			1
@entity18 , meanwhile , unveiled a new plan to limit oil market speculation as a way to address high gas prices angering @entity28 as the campaign for the november election heats up			2
the @entity1 / @entity32 poll showed that @entity4 's popularity is starting to rebound now that the divisiveness of the @entity6 primaries appears to be all but over			1
according to the survey , 44 % of people questioned said they have a favorable view of @entity4 , up 10 points from february , while 43 % said they have an unfavorable opinion , down 11 points , and 13 % were unsure			2
according to the poll , 53 % of @entity28 plan to give @entity4 a second look when the primaries are officially over , with 45 % saying they already know enough about @entity4 to decide whether he would be a good president			1
the survey indicates @entity4 's popularity still lags well behind @entity18 's : 56 % have a favorable view of the president , with 42 % saying they see @entity18 in a negative light			1
" the @entity6 's favorable rating has also rebounded now that the nomination fight is all but over , from 35 % in march to 41 % , " said @entity1 polling director @entity51			2
" that still puts the @entity6 several points behind the @entity57 's 46 % rating , but it is an indication that the wounds have started to heal from the primary season			0
" @entity1 poll : @entity4 's favorable rating rebounds both house speaker @entity63 , @entity64 , and @entity65 leader @entity65 of @entity66 said tuesday they back @entity4 's nomination			1
the statements a few hours apart were intended to show growing @entity6 support for @entity4 despite mistrust among some conservatives over his moderate policies when he was @entity8 governor			2
" i will be proud to support @entity4 and do everything i can to help him win , " @entity63 told reporters after he met with @entity11 @entity6 to discuss the november election			2
@entity4 still needs several hundred delegates to formally secure the @entity6 nomination , but the withdrawal from the race last week by his main conservative challenger , @entity81 , left @entity4 's path unobstructed			1
@entity83 later told reporters he also is backing @entity4 , which is no surprise but represents a formal endorsement after the @entity66 senator previously said @entity4 would be the party 's nominee and " an excellent candidate			1
" @entity16 , another @entity4 supporter , raised eyebrows this weekend when he said at an @entity91 convention that if @entity18 wins re-election in november , " i will either be dead or in jail by this time next year			2
" he accused the government of " wiping its ass with the @entity97 " and labeled members of the @entity18 administration , including the vice president , attorney general and secretary of state , " criminals			2
" " we need to ride into that battlefield and chop their heads off in november , " @entity16 said			0
responding to the comments by @entity16 , who announced his support for @entity4 last month , campaign spokeswoman @entity108 said : " divisive language is offensive no matter what side of the political aisle it comes from			0
" " @entity4 believes everyone needs to be civil , " @entity115 added			0
her reaction followed a call from @entity120 chair rep. @entity119 of @entity121 for @entity4 to denounce comments she called " despicable , deplorable and completely beyond the pale			0
" " @entity4 's surrogates should know better than to rally the troops with outrageous rhetoric that is unacceptable in our political debate , " @entity119 said in a statement			1
@entity18 said tuesday that the new measures he announced to limit speculation in oil markets will make amends to consumers for congressional republicans blocking an end to subsidies for oil corporations			1
" a few weeks ago , @entity141 had the chance to stand up for families already paying an extra premium at the pump , but congressional @entity6 voted to keep spending billions of @entity28 ' hard - earned tax dollars on more unnecessary subsidies for big oil companies , " @entity18 said in his announcement in the @entity140			1
" so here 's a chance to make amends			0
" @entity12 @entity6 three weeks ago blocked a @entity57 measure championed by @entity18 to end tax breaks for the major oil companies , which he said are enjoying record profits			2
four @entity57 crossed party lines to vote against the bill , but even if it had passed the @entity12 , it was given little chance in the @entity6 - controlled @entity11			0
@entity18 's proposal would require traders to put up more of their own money for transactions			1
it also would ask for more funding for market enforcement and monitoring , and increase penalties for manipulating markets			0
@entity18 and @entity6 have drawn lines over oil prices since they started to rise to near - record levels earlier this year			2
@entity6 say @entity18 has n't done enough to stem the rise and advocate opening up more areas for drilling and approving projects like the @entity177 , which would carry oil from @entity179 to refineries in @entity181			2
but analysts say such measures would have little effect on the current price of oil and gasoline			0
most @entity28 blame big oil for the spike in prices -- a recent @entity1 / @entity32 poll showed that the majority blamed the oil companies while 24 % blamed @entity18 and 21 % blamed @entity6 policies			1
@entity1 poll : gender gap and likeability keep @entity18 over @entity4 @entity18 's announcement came a day after one of the elements of his tax policy was blocked by @entity6 in the @entity12			1
the so - called @entity202 -- named after billionaire @entity203 , who says the tax rate he pays should be no lower than that of his secretary -- failed to get the necessary 60 votes to go to the @entity12 floor			0
the measure would have raised the minimum tax rate to 30 % for those making more than $ 1 million a year			0
@entity6 presidential candidate @entity4 said that @entity18 , by pushing the @entity202 , shows that the incumbent is " out of ideas " on the economy			1
speaking to the @entity215 in @entity216 on monday night , @entity4 cited a calculation that the measure , which would have raised the minimum tax rate to 30 % for those making between $ 1 million and $ 2 million , would have paid for " 11 hours of government			0
" " this is not exactly a grand idea , " @entity4 said			0
" this is a man who is out of ideas , he 's out of excuses and in 2012 we 're going to make sure he gets put out of office			0
" however , a @entity1 / @entity32 poll released monday found that seven in 10 respondents said they favored the bill			1
@entity4 's wife , @entity231 , was to be the guest of honor later tuesday at a birthday celebration / fundraiser being held for her by @entity237 's wife , @entity236 , at the couple 's residence in @entity240 in @entity241			1
@entity237 spokesman @entity242 said about 400 people were invited to the event , which was expected to bring in " well in excess " of $ 600,000			0
@entity242 said @entity237 will stop by the fundraiser to wish @entity247 , who turned 63 on monday , a happy birthday and he expects to host another fundraiser for the campaign at @entity240 once @entity4 officially clinches the nomination			0
first lady @entity252 will also be raising cash on tuesday			0
she will speak at a @entity120 event in @entity255 , followed by two @entity120 fundraisers in @entity257			0
@entity4 could cross paths with the first lady when he holds a midday campaign roundtable at a community center in the @entity257 suburb of @entity262			0
