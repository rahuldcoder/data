-- president @entity2 will sign an executive order establishing a presidential commission to investigate the @entity6 oil spill , an administration official said monday			1
eight @entity8 senators called earlier monday for an independent federal investigation of whether oil giant @entity10 violated civil or criminal laws in connection with the @entity6 oil spill			1
it has n't been determined when @entity2 will make the announcement of the presidential commission or when he 'll sign the executive order , said the official , who did not want to speak on the record ahead of an announcement			2
" the commission will take into account the investigations under way concerning the causes of the spill and explore a range of issues , " the official said			1
in particular , the commission 's inquiry will focus on industry practices , rig safety , regulatory regimes , federal governmental oversight -- including the structure and functions of the @entity36 -- and environmental review and other protections , the official said			2
last week , @entity2 harshly criticized the companies involved in the spill , which threatens to become one of the nation 's worst environmental disasters , and pledged to break up what he called the cozy relationship between regulators and the oil industry			1
in testimony on @entity48 , @entity10 touted its progress toward plugging the spill , but a top @entity2 administration official said the disaster is far from over			1
officials grilled on oil spill " we are in the middle of this crisis			1
we are not at the beginning , " homeland security secretary @entity56 told a @entity58 committee monday afternoon			2
" we 've been at it a month almost , but we are not near the end as well			2
" @entity10 has successfully inserted a siphon into the damaged riser pipe from the underwater well at the heart of the spill			1
the procedure has allowed the company to collect more than 1,000 barrels ( 42,000 gallons ) of oil a day that would otherwise spill into the @entity6 , said @entity70 , the company 's chief operating officer			1
that , combined with the use of chemical dispersants to break up the spill , has reduced the amount of oil reaching the surface , he said			1
" this [ is ] probably the smallest amount of oil i 've seen on the surface since the effort began , " @entity70 said			1
the well had been spewing an estimated 5,000 barrels a day into the @entity6 since late april , when the drill rig @entity83 blew up and sank about 40 miles off @entity84			1
eleven workers are presumed dead after the sinking , and the cause has not been determined			2
some of the oil has washed ashore on the @entity84 coast , and tar balls related to the spill have turned up as far east as @entity92 , @entity93			1
some estimates put the amount of oil gushing from the well far higher than the 5,000 - barrel - per - day estimate made by the @entity98 a few days after the spill began			1
samples taken by scientists offshore have raised concerns that large plumes of oil are settling below the surface			1
@entity105 , a professor of marine sciences at the @entity107 , told @entity0 's " @entity110 " that the size of the suspected plumes is hard to determine			2
" nothing like it has really ever been seen in the deep water of the @entity6 before , " she said			1
" it 's not only a large feature , but it 's a very complex feature			2
there 's a lot of vertical structure to it			0
" but federal officials said the results have not been fully analyzed			0
@entity122 , a scientific adviser from @entity98 , said descriptions of " layers of oil " beneath the @entity6 were " totally untrue			1
" " they were able to detect what we think is hydrocarbons in the water column			0
it was stated as oil , but it was n't like oil you could see , " @entity122 told reporters monday afternoon			2
the researchers were looking into the effects of the undersea dispersants used to break up the oil near the mouth of the well , nearly a mile beneath the surface , @entity98 administrator @entity137 said in a statement issued monday			1
but @entity137 said the agency does not consider dispersants -- which have their own hazards -- " a silver bullet			0
" " they are used to move us towards the lesser of two environmental outcomes			0
until the flow of oil is stemmed , we must take every responsible action to reduce the impact of the oil , " she said			2
@entity70 said the next step in capping the well is a " top kill " procedure , in which a large amount of heavy " mud " -- a fluid used as a lubricant and counterweight in drilling operations -- is inserted into the well bore			0
if that succeeds , the well will be cemented shut , he said			0
" that is the method we think we will be deploying later this week or this weekend , " @entity70 said			0
another option -- putting debris in the well to stop the flow -- may also be utilized , he said			0
and once the leak is sealed , " we intend to fill up the bottom of this well with cement and it will never be produced			0
" @entity10 , as the well 's owner , is responsible for stopping the underwater gusher and paying for the cleanup , and @entity185 said the company has paid more than $ 9.6 million so far without denying a claim			1
@entity10 ceo @entity10 , who appeared with @entity185 before the @entity190 , said the company was concentrating on plugging the leak and limiting the economic damage			1
" we will put blame , liability , and those kind of things over to the side			0
that 's not our concern right now , " he said			0
large oil plumes may pose additional threat the april 20 explosion aboard @entity83 has left @entity10 , rig owner - operator @entity205 and oilfield services contractor @entity206 pointing fingers at each other over the cause of the blast			1
the doomed rig 's chief electronics technician told the @entity214 news program " @entity215 " on sunday that @entity205 was being pushed to complete the well quickly because it was taking longer than expected -- an allegation @entity70 would not discuss during an appearance on " @entity110			0
" " i know people are talking about various things that occurred that night on the rig , but i actually have n't seen any of the results of these interviews or investigations ... i do n't actually have any knowledge that that was the case , " he said			0
a top official of the @entity228 agency that oversees offshore drilling is retiring a month earlier than planned			0
@entity231 told his bosses after the @entity83 explosion that he would retire at the end of june , an administration official told @entity0 , but announced monday that he would step down at the end of may instead			0
@entity231 has been associate director of the @entity36 's @entity236 since 2007			0
in the past , critics have accused @entity36 of being too cozy with the industries it regulates			0
a 2008 report from the @entity228 's inspector - general found @entity36 employees received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them			0
interior secretary @entity248 last week announced he would split @entity36 into separate divisions -- one for regulating offshore oil drilling and the other for collecting royalties from oil companies			2
@entity248 is scheduled to appear before the @entity254 on tuesday , while @entity255 , the current @entity36 director , will appear before the @entity256			0
@entity0 's @entity257 and @entity258 contributed to this report .			0
