-- the @entity2 's hopes of marking her @entity3 with a win at @entity5 were dashed when her horse , @entity7 , was beaten by two - and - a - quarter lengths by so you think in the showpiece @entity11 on wednesday			1
the victory marked redemption for the @entity15 - trained six - year - old			0
runner - up in this race last year to the ill - fated @entity20 , the @entity17 - bred horse has traveled the globe in search of an elusive 10th @entity24 victory			0
the dual @entity26 winner could be considered to be the horse with the biggest carbon footprint in racing , having tried his luck in @entity31 , @entity32 , the @entity33 and @entity34			0
he is now expected to take a well - deserved retirement to stud having passed the Â £ 5 million ( $ 7.87m ) prize money barrier			2
the queen , dressed in pink for the second day of @entity5 , had watched @entity7 parade before the race and exchanged a few words with @entity43 of @entity34 , who gifted @entity7 to the @entity2 as a yearling			2
one of the best - known owners and breeders of racehorses in the country , the @entity2 has not had a group 1 winner in @entity50 since @entity51 captured the @entity52 in her @entity53 year , 1977 .			1

so you think wins @entity11 at @entity5
the @entity2 's horse , @entity7 , beaten by two - and - a - quarter lengths
winning horse now expected to retire to stud
the @entity2 has not had a group 1 winner in @entity50 since 1977
