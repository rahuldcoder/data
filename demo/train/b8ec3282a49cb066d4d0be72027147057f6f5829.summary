@entity0 -- it 's been more than four months since longtime @entity4 dictator @entity3 was forced out by his people in largely peaceful mass protests that lasted 18 days			1
the opposition activists who celebrated in the streets after @entity3 stepped down had hoped that tangible changes would follow soon after their @entity11 victory			1
it had not even taken three weeks to rid the country of an autocratic president who had ruled with an iron fist for three decades			2
why , then , is it taking so long to achieve further progress ? " the people who went to @entity11 were fed up with corruption , with the lack of freedom , the social injustice and police brutality , " said @entity18 , a 27 - year old accountant who camped out with fellow revolutionaries in the square			1
" we thought we would feel the change once @entity3 and his men were no longer in power			1
" but four months on , little has changed on the ground			2
with parliamentary elections planned for september and the government in transition , the nation 's economic outlook is as bleak as ever			2
the country 's long - detested police force , which deserted the streets during the uprising , has been hesitant to return and face the wrath of a now - emboldened and angry public			2
this has contributed to a security vacuum that has led to increased crime , thuggery and a spate of sectarian violence			0
yet protesters still face the prospect of detention and possible mistreatment , human rights activists say			0
many @entity4 feel that the revolution is incomplete as they wait for @entity3 and members of his former administration to be brought to justice			1
they wonder why the @entity58 , now in control , has not acted against former regime members to show its commitment to change			0
trials of the former ministers -- facing charges ranging from misuse of public funds to ordering the killing of protesters --- have been postponed several times			0
@entity3 himself has so far escaped justice , although he is under arrest in his hospital room in the @entity73 resort of @entity74 and has been barred from leaving the country			1
" @entity4 too are dismayed that the ousted president 's loyalists were given ample time to hide their assets , " @entity76 , a founding member of the april 6 youth movement , recently told a @entity0 gathering			1
some @entity84 users ask why the @entity58 and the transitional government have taken to so long to put parliamentary speaker @entity86 , @entity3 's chief of staff @entity87 and @entity90 secretary general @entity89 behind bars			1
there has been no official response			0
members of the @entity3 's ruling @entity90 still hold key positions in state institutions			1
" whenever one @entity90 member is forced out by angry protesters , he or she is almost immediately replaced by another @entity3 loyalist , " said @entity97 , a journalist working for the state - sponsored @entity99 newspaper			1
at @entity4 's state tv , where i worked until quitting february 3 in protest of the uprising coverage , the same heads of channels and senior editors who described revolutionaries as traitors and foreign agents during that period are still in charge " nothing has changed , " said @entity119 , a news editor with the main @entity121 channel			1
" in fact , there is greater control now than there was during the @entity3 era			1
all scripts are revised by senior editorial staff , and any news item related to the armed forces has to be approved by the @entity132 before it is aired or published			0
" in recent weeks , six journalists were summoned by the military prosecutor for questioning after publicly criticizing the military on television talk shows			2
among them was @entity139 , who had urged that members of the armed forces be held accountable for any wrongdoing , saying that no one is above the law			0
blogger @entity145 was sentenced to three years in prison by a military court for criticizing the army			0
the @entity151 - based @entity150 , which promotes press freedom , has said that such actions were meant " to create a climate of fear and to intimidate journalists			2
" in a more shocking development just weeks ago , a young reporter was sexually assaulted while covering a friday rally in @entity11			0
the attack was front - page news , and all the local dailies carried a picture of the reporter in apparent shock after her ordeal			0
in a conservative , predominantly @entity168 society where a girl 's chastity is closely linked to family honor , it is rare for such photographs to be displayed publicly for fear they may sully a girl 's reputation and stigmatize her for life			0
" the decision by local media editors to brazenly show the pictures was a clear message to deter female protesters from joining their male counterparts in @entity11 in future , " businessman @entity178 suggested			0
there also have been reports of brutality against @entity11 protesters arrested since @entity3 's fall from power			1
@entity192 , a young activist who has made it her mission to document rights abuses by the armed forces , says one group of detainees was subjected to torture , including electric shocks , at the hands of the military march 9			0
in an earlier incident , on february 26 , opposition activist @entity203 alleges that he and fellow protesters were relentlessly beaten and kicked while in detention , allowed a brief respite only when they followed orders to chant " long live @entity3			1
" as the elections draw nearer , many are left wondering whether the military rulers will be willing to cede power to a civil government			0
ambassador @entity214 , former official spokesman for the @entity215 , @entity4 's highest religious authority , is one of the skeptics			2
" @entity4 has been ruled by the military for 60 years , " he said			2
" convincing the diehard dictators to loosen their grip on power wo n't be easy			0

it took only 18 days for @entity4 to oust president @entity3
why is further progress taking so much longer ?
many wait for @entity3 and his loyalists to be brought to justice
journalists say *restrictions* are even worse now than under @entity3
