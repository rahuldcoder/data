-- @entity1 and tv host @entity2 was a larger - than - life personality			1
and a report released thursday confirms he was also an extravagant sexual predator , using his access to hospitals as a volunteer porter and fundraiser to abuse victims aged from 5 to 75			1
the review of @entity2 's behavior at 28 hospitals across the @entity15 makes shocking reading , detailing a catalog of abuses against some of @entity15 's most vulnerable people over the course of decades			1
protected by his celebrity and exploiting a network of relationships he built in hospitals , he carried out rapes , other sexual abuse and displayed an unhealthy interest in dead bodies in a hospital mortuary			1
worse , the abuse went unchecked and unpunished , since the @entity34 entertainer died before the allegations against him were made public			0
@entity15 health secretary @entity36 apologized in the @entity37 on thursday to all the victims abused by @entity2 while in the care of the @entity40 -- and said the system had let down those who were brave enough to raise the alarm but had their complaints ignored			1
" @entity2 was a callous , opportunistic , wicked predator who abused and raped individuals , many of them patients and young people , who expected and had a right to expect to be safe			1
his actions span five decades -- from the 1960s to 2010 , " @entity36 said			0
" the family favorite loved by millions courted popularity and used it to perpetrate and cover up his own evil acts			1
" victims who complained were " time and again " ignored , or if heard , little or no action was taken , @entity36 said			0
" people and institutions turned a blind eye			0
" " as a nation at that time we held @entity2 in our affection as a somewhat eccentric national treasure with a strong commitment to charitable causes , " @entity36 said			2
" today 's reports show that in reality he was a sickening and prolific sexual abuser who repeatedly exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes			2
" victims ' ages from 5 to 75 ' abused and raped patients without scruple ' for a generation who grew up watching @entity81 on tv 's " @entity82 " and his children 's program " @entity87 'll fix it , " the revelations that first emerged in 2012 were deeply disturbing			2
thursday 's report into the full extent of his offending against children and adults , patients and staff , in 28 hospitals -- particularly @entity96 and @entity97 , a high - security psychiatric institution -- will do nothing to reassure them			1
the @entity96 report reveals a sexual predator who , while volunteering as a porter , " abused and raped patients without scruple , " said @entity36			1
some 60 people reported abuse to the @entity96 investigation , including a teenager who believed she was pregnant as a result of @entity2 's actions , he said			2
" two witnesses told the investigation @entity2 claimed to have had jewellery made from glass eyes taken from bodies in the mortuary , " @entity36 added , saying that other claims were too horrific to recount in parliament			1
the report cites one witness who tells how @entity2 recounted making trips to the hospital mortuary , where he claimed to have manipulated bodies before rigor mortis set in , taken photographs and performed sex acts on them			1
the report 's authors say they have " no way of proving @entity2 's claim that he interfered with the bodies of deceased patients in the mortuary			1
" however , it is established that he " publicly declared his interest in the dead , " that he visited a friend who worked in the mortuary and that controls were lax for many years			0
" in light of the claims about the glass eye jewellery and @entity2 's interference with the bodies of the deceased , it is evident his interest in the mortuary was not within accepted boundaries , " it concludes			1
' very manipulative ' the report from @entity97 said 10 people had alleged they were sexually assaulted by @entity2 , plus a case of indecent exposure involving a minor			2
the investigation concluded that at least five people were sexually abused and a sixth was more likely than not to have been			0
five other victims could not be contacted for detailed accounts			0
the report gives an insight into how @entity2 was able to gain a position of influence at the secure institution that included giving him keys to wards and allowing him to watch female patients undress to bathe			2
" @entity2 could be charming and persuasive , at least to some , but at the same time he was grandiose , narcissistic , arrogant and lacking any empathy , " it states			2
" he was also very manipulative , and many staff were convinced that he had close connections in high places and had the power to have them dismissed			0
" @entity178 , permanent secretary of the @entity179 , said in a statement that " inadequate processes " had allowed @entity2 to gain the position of authority at @entity97 that aided his abusive behavior			1
" while much has changed in the intervening years we will leave no stone unturned to make sure such appalling actions can never be repeated ; our thoughts today are with the people who suffered and continue to suffer from these terrible crimes , " she said			0
the @entity15 's @entity193 children 's charity said more must be done to safeguard children and ensure that an apparent " culture of turning a blind eye " to abuse is not repeated			0
" to hear that some hospital staff may have actively facilitated @entity2 's abuse of children is sickening and takes the scandal of his crimes to yet another abhorrent level , " said @entity198 , national services director for the charity			1
" @entity2 escaped justice because people did n't want to hear or believe what children were saying			0
ministers now need to be satisfied that this could never happen again and that children and vulnerable adults in hospitals or any government facility are safe today			0
" @entity2 died in october 2011 at age 84 , soon after being treated in a hospital for pneumonia			0
his long history of abuse emerged only a year later , thanks to a tv documentary by @entity15 broadcaster @entity223			0
the @entity34 , where he worked as a radio dj and tv presenter , has set up a separate inquiry into abuses he carried out on @entity34 premises			0
@entity0 's @entity230 and @entity231 contributed to this report .			0
