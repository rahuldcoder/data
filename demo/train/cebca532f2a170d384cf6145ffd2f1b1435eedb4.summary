-- his journey started in @entity3 , a taunted teenager with large tumors on his face , driven into deep despair			2
eleven years later , @entity8 has undergone numerous surgeries and is a step closer to achieving his dream of becoming a doctor			1
in a rare act , the @entity13 passed a private bill last week granting @entity8 permanent residency after years of his living in @entity19 on an expired visa			1
the bill is awaiting president @entity23 's signature			1
" the day @entity13 passed the bill was one of the happiest days of my life , " says @entity8 , who left @entity3 as a teen in 2001 to get treatment for the tumors			1
private bills -- which only apply to one person and mostly focus on immigration -- seldom pass			0
his is the only private bill to pass in @entity13 in two years			1
" i was overwhelmed with joy ; it was nothing less than a miracle , " the 26 - year - old says			0
" only in this country can so many miraculous and wonderful things happen to someone like me			0
" before coming to the @entity40 at age 15 , @entity8 lived in the southeastern @entity3 town of @entity43			1
he suffers from neurofibromatosis , a genetic disorder that causes massive life - threatening tumors on his face			0
treated as an outcast because of his deformed face , he was depressed and humiliated , he says			0
his family abandoned him at an orphanage			0
nuns from the @entity54 rescued him from the orphanage more than a decade ago and arranged for a @entity19 doctor to perform surgery on him			1
he says he considers himself lucky to have developed the tumors			0
" without them , i would not have met the nun , left @entity3 , arrived in the @entity40 and had the miracle to attend medical school , " he says			1
he lives with the nuns in @entity64 , @entity19			2
they have cared for him since he came to the @entity40 , where he has undergone seven surgeries , including one that left him blind in the right eye			2
doctors performed @entity8 's surgeries over a period of time , he says , which contributed to his expired visa			1
despite the obstacles , he remains committed to getting an education			0
" my own personal struggles to receive treatment have motivated and encouraged me to pursue a medical career ... to alleviate the pain and suffering of others , " he says			2
" a medical career will allow me many gratifying years of making a difference in the health and lives of others			0
i strongly believe one can make another person 's life worthy of living ... i have experienced it			0
" he finished his ged -- the equivalent of a high school education -- while undergoing treatment and enrolled at a community college			2
a benefactor later helped him attend @entity97 , where he graduated with a bachelor 's degree in biochemistry and chemical biology last year			0
he had a 3.82 gpa and gave the university 's commencement speech			0
" should i call myself a victim , or should i press forward to my dreams ? " he asked during the speech amid thunderous applause			0
soon after his graduation , the @entity108 in @entity109 admitted him to medical school			1
the only hurdle : the program requires him to have permanent residency status , also known as a green card			1
though he qualifies for the @entity117 , which gives immigrants who came to the @entity40 as minors temporary residency , the measure would not give him the permanent status mandated by the university , according to his attorney			2
and so began @entity8 's journey to get legalized , a quest that has seen strangers rally to his help			1
his attorney @entity128 took his case pro bono			0
" @entity8 's story is remarkable , " says @entity128 , who is based in @entity131 " here is this kid who comes from @entity3 , he was taunted and teased for his diseases , and he comes to this country and excels , despite so many surgeries			1
it is a testament of not letting anything get in the way			0
" sen. @entity142 , a @entity19 @entity143 , sponsored the bill , @entity145 285			1
the measure passed the @entity147 in the summer and the @entity148 last week " already , his example has enriched @entity19 and our nation , but i know that his contributions to our country are only beginning , " @entity142 said in a statement			1
the number of illegal immigrants in the @entity40 was estimated at 11.5 million last year			2
if @entity23 signs the bill , the @entity158 will reduce by one the number of immigrant visas available to @entity3			0
that signature , @entity8 says , will be his favorite holiday gift .			2
