-- in the wake of the @entity2 prime minister 's visit to @entity7 last week , @entity2 's struggles to move forward from its wartime past are back in the headlines			1
commentators decry that @entity11 's visit will increase tensions in @entity13			2
they are right : this gesture will curdle @entity2 's already sour relations with @entity16 or @entity17 , and indeed has already provoked the predictable outcry			1
but @entity7 visits are a symptom , not the main cause , of @entity2 's poor relations with its neighbors			1
a country 's commemoration is a vital part of its national identity , but depending on their political agendas , leaders constantly manipulate and negotiate national remembrance			2
countries often glorify their own past , while vilifying their rivals ' behavior and ignoring their suffering			0
one country 's heroes are another 's villains â € ” as seen , for example , in the @entity41 decision to name a square after @entity43 , a young woman who carried out the deadliest terror attack in @entity46 's history , killing 13 children among the 38 dead			2
this decision outraged @entity46 ; an adviser to the prime minister said it represented the " glorification of murderers " and was another example of " incitement of hatred and violence against @entity55 and @entity46			1
" on the other hand , for countries seeking reconciliation , leaders understand that they must avoid commemoration that antagonizes their partner			1
so , they look for inclusive , rather than alienating , ways to remember their heroes and history			0
thus when the @entity68 and @entity69 commemorated the past , they mourned together at @entity70 , a site associated with the @entity73 resistance , which emphasized @entity73 honor rather than brutality			0
the @entity77 and @entity73 leaders in 1984 clasped hands together at @entity79 ( the site of the bloody @entity80 battle where both countries experienced monumental losses )			2
later , @entity77 and @entity73 leaders , alongside their @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 counterparts , bowed their heads together at @entity90			0
furthermore , reconciliation between the @entity86 and @entity92 was also reflected in and reinforced by commemoration			0
last month in @entity96 , leaders from the two countries , once bitter enemies , together paid respects to @entity86 and @entity92 who perished in the @entity80			2
all these countries adopted unifying rather than divisive themes in their commemoration , because they perceived reconciliation to be a vital interest			2
in @entity13 , a mix of domestic politics and strategic conditions are pushing in the opposite direction			0
@entity17 and @entity2 are struggling to define the rules of a region in which they are now both great powers			1
@entity111 resents and worries about @entity17 air and naval incursions into the @entity115 , where the two countries dispute ownership of an island chain ( known as @entity118 in @entity2 , @entity118 in @entity17 )			1
the @entity17 see similar menace in @entity2 's efforts to control the islands			1
the @entity17 also fear @entity11 's desire to increase patriotic nationalism and to revise @entity2 's " peace constitution " to permit greater military assertiveness			1
as for @entity16 , one might think that the rise of @entity17 power would push @entity128 closer to @entity111 , particularly since the two countries share an ally in the @entity85			2
but so far this has not been the case ; @entity128 enjoys excellent relations with @entity133 , and has shown a strong tendency toward hedging between @entity13 's great powers			2
indeed , national remembrance in @entity13 reflects that reconciliation is not a priority			0
in @entity111 , @entity11 's decision to visit @entity7 was a clear choice to cater to a powerful conservative domestic political base , and to reinforce his " patriotic " agenda			0
@entity7 enshrines among its 2 million souls 14 war criminals , and features a museum that whitewashes @entity2 's past aggression			1
with his visit , @entity11 has demonstrated that he sees nationalism -- a vital part of domestic mobilization against security threatsâ € ” as more important than conciliation toward @entity128 or @entity133			0
for their part , @entity17 and @entity16 also remember the past in ways antagonistic to @entity2			1
@entity17 's memory of the @entity160 massacre â € ” such as at the @entity161 -- depicts the @entity2 as rapacious and incurably prone to aggression			1
of course , the @entity17 suffered terribly at the hands of the @entity2 , and the @entity164 is a horrific blight on human history			1
yet the @entity68 were no less wounded by the @entity69 , and they have chosen to reconcile with their former tormentors			0
similarly , in a controversy similar to the one over @entity168 , @entity17 and @entity16 have recently decided to build a statue in @entity170 , @entity17 , to honor a man who assassinated a @entity2 leader there			1
in 1909 , @entity173 shot @entity174 , a highly decorated , four - time @entity2 prime minister and resident - general of @entity2 - occupied @entity16			1
@entity16 soccer fans have also unfurled massive banners of @entity178 at matches against the @entity2 national team			0
outraged , @entity111 calls @entity178 a criminal			0
some have likened the statue in @entity170 to building a statue to @entity185 in @entity186			0
commemoration is not the root cause of poor relations in @entity190 ; it is a window to just how distant relations are there			0
instead of looking for ways to honor and show respect for one another 's heroes and history , they remember in ways that humiliate and antagonize			1
sadly , as long as prevailing strategic trends continue , we are likely to see more of the same			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			0

@entity203 : visit by @entity2 's prime minister to war shrine provoked *objections* from @entity17
she says history can be used by leaders to encourage reconciliation or to humiliate and antagonize
many factors lie behind the tension between @entity2 and @entity17 , she says
several @entity217 countries have shown how joint commemorations can advance *harmony* , she says
