-- @entity1 plans to give its solar business a charge in two years with the introduction of panels with the same solar cell material used by industry cost leader @entity7			1
@entity9 is developing a solar energy product aimed at utility and commercial customers			0
in 2011 , the energy giant expects to produce solar panels made with cadmium telluride , a thin - film solar cell material , said @entity17 , vice president of advanced technologies at @entity19 at the @entity21 conference here on wednesday			1
the company now sells solar panels that use silicon solar cells , but its long - term bet is on thin - film and specifically cadmium telluride because it offers the cheapest cost per watt , he said			1
last year , @entity1 's energy division took a majority stake in @entity30 , @entity32 - based @entity31 , for its cadmium telluride cell technology			1
@entity1 is now developing a product around that aimed at utility and commercial customers			2
solar at @entity1 is a relatively small part of its sprawling energy portfolio , which covers everything from nuclear power plants to natural gas turbines			2
but @entity1 expects that solar has the potential to grow rapidly , as its multi-billion dollar wind business has done over the past five years			2
" @entity7 is definitely the next wind for us			0
it 's not there yet but it 's moving very rapidly , " said @entity17			0
solar is more expensive than wind right now , but @entity1 expects that renewable energy mandates will help drive growth and bring costs down , he said			2
thin - film solar cells offer lower production costs than the incumbent silicon because thin - film cells use far less material			1
over the past five years , several solar companies have formed to make thin - film cells from a combination copper , indium , gallium , and selenide ( @entity65 ) , which are still not in the market in high volumes			1
@entity1 's cells will be made from a compound of cadmium and tellurium			2
@entity73 cells are durable and more efficient at converting sunlight to electricity than thin - film solar cells with the most efficient commercial silicon cells over 20 percent			1
but @entity78 projects that it can boost the efficiency of cadmium telluride to 12 percent and potentially higher , @entity17 said			0
" we are excited about it because it can produce in diffuse light , " he said			0
" the module ( panel ) life is 20 years -- that 's what the customer wants			0
it has the right production costs and right efficiency target			1
" asked how its cadmium telluride products will differ from @entity7 's , @entity17 said that @entity1 's device would be more " flexible for customers			0
" during his presentation , @entity17 said that @entity1 is looking at ways at managing an entire solar array in a large installation built by a utility or commercial customer			0
after his talk , he said that @entity1 is developing technology to recycle the solar cell material , as cadmium is a very toxic if it enters the environment			1

@entity1 to change from silicon solar cells to thin - film material
@entity1 says change has the right production costs and right efficiency target
thin - film solar cell material offers lowest cost per watt , @entity1 says
@entity1 is developing technology to recycle the solar cell material
