-- @entity1 was on her way to a religious gathering when her sisters called to say they were under attack			2
" they were running for their safety as they called , " she said			0
" when i heard , i realized how far it was to the main compound , and i was like , ' oh , my @entity13			0
' " @entity14 and her family are members of a @entity18 minority sect called the @entity19 , who hold annual gatherings in each country where they have a community			0
it was in july 2005 that the @entity25 gathering came under attack by -- @entity1 estimates -- 10,000 people throwing stones			0
the protesters outnumbered the @entity19 by 100 to 1			0
@entity14 was on her way to the gathering in @entity32 , @entity33 province , from the capital @entity34 with a member of the @entity25 @entity37 when the attack happened			0
by the time she arrived , houses and books had been burned , she said			0
" no one was killed , but there were some minor injuries from the throwing of rocks			0
we decided to call off the conference			0
it was unsafe to go on with the gathering , " said @entity14 , 27 , a graduate student studying climate change at @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52			0
" there was so much anger in their faces , " said @entity14 , a native of @entity25 who has been living in the @entity55 for 10 years			1
police provided buses to get the @entity19 community to safety , but @entity14 does not know of any arrests or prosecutions as a result of the attack			0
" it was really disappointing			0
we have the right to be there			0
but the police were trying to minimize the clashes , rather than trying to say we have the right to be there , " she said			0
@entity25 -- the most populous @entity18 country in the world -- is often touted as an example of tolerance and democracy in the @entity83 world			0
but a huge new study suggests it 's actually among the most restrictive countries in the world when it comes to religion			1
the study charted publicly reported incidents of religious violence , intolerance , intimidation and discrimination in 198 countries and territories from mid- 2006 to mid- 2008 , its authors said			1
@entity98 , the lead researcher on the project , said he worked on the study for more than three years			2
the report looks not only at legal restrictions , but also at how laws are implemented and how social tensions restrict freedom of religion , even where there is no official or legal bar against the practice			1
in fact , more than two out of three people around the world live in countries with high or very high restrictions on religion , according to the report , which claims to be the first to systematically measure religious discrimination			1
it produced some surprising findings and makes it possible to compare countries in ways that could not be done before , its authors say			2
" most reports do n't try to quantify , " @entity98 said			2
" what you are left with is studies that do n't allow you to see patterns			2
" the study , " @entity133 , " found some interesting ones			2
for example , " religion - related violence happens in the majority of countries , but only in one in 10 does that escalate " to terrorism causing casualties , @entity98 said			1
the study tracked violence between religious groups in 126 countries -- 64 percent of the countries in the survey			1
but there was religion - related terrorism leading to injury or death in only 17 countries -- 9 percent of those in the study			1
in about a quarter of all countries , majority groups use force or threat of force against minority religions , according to the study , from the @entity161 in @entity162			1
nearly half of all countries restrict the activities of foreign missionaries or prohibit them altogether			1
ninety percent have some requirement that religious groups register with the government , usually in return for some benefit such as a tax exemption			2
but in 40 percent of countries , those registration requirements result in major problems for those groups			2
" others often focus on naming and shaming , but this one is looking more in depth at what goes on on the street in countries -- what affects a person 's ability to freely practice religion in society , " @entity98 said			1
" sometimes , one incident of violence can affect a whole country			2
" the report also makes it possible to compare what kinds of restrictions are placed on religious practices in different countries			1
@entity198 , for example , has tight legal controls on the practice of religion , but has has relatively little social conflict over faith			1
@entity205 , by contrast , has only moderate government restrictions on religious observance , but very high levels of social hostility -- primarily between @entity18 and @entity210			1
@entity211 has the lowest ratings in both categories among the 25 largest countries in the world , while @entity216 has the highest , followed closely by @entity25			1
@entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 also rate poorly for religious freedom , while @entity221 , the @entity55 , @entity222 , @entity223 and the @entity224 score well			1
@entity227 governments place more restrictions on religion than do governments in @entity231 or @entity232 , the survey concluded			1
while the @entity55 has a low level of government restriction on religion , it does experience a moderate amount of social tension , the report found			1
" the test is not whether someone who belongs to the majority faith and is affluent and is socially advanced feels restrictions , but whether religious minorities do , " said @entity243 , associate director of research at the @entity161			1
" so in the @entity55 , what does a @entity18 woman who wears a hijab in a small city feel ? " religious discrimination in the @entity55 is not simply a matter of people feeling uncomfortable , he added			1
" law enforcement officials report to the @entity255 every year on hate crimes , including religious bias , " he said			0
" there were about 1,400 each year [ in the study ] , and they were reported in nearly all 50 states			0
those crimes run the gamut , but they include arsons			0
" the @entity55 was also marked down because of the @entity267 administration 's " global war on terror , " @entity98 said			2
" the fact [ is ] that we have detainees from a war that at least one side is calling religion - related -- the @entity274 detainees , " he said			0
neither the september 11 , 2001 , attacks and their aftermath , nor the shootings at @entity278 in @entity279 this year were included in the time period covered by the study , he said , but both could have increased the @entity55 score for social hostilities based on religion , @entity98 said			1
" scores are not fixed			0
situations can change , which is why we are looking at this as an over-time study , " he said			0
" countries and societies will change in how they respond to the situations they face			0
" in fact , the authors plan to revisit the question of religious restrictions regularly , so they can track changes over time , and the @entity55 might rank differently when the @entity278 shootings are included -- if investigators rule that they were motivated at least partly by religion			1
the study authors do not assign motives to incidents of discrimination , instead relying on local sources to determine the causes			2
the study does not rank countries from " best " to " worst " -- saying such a list would not be meaningful -- but instead groups them into those with very high restrictions , high restrictions , moderate or low			1
it does not include @entity319 , because there is not enough reliable data from the reclusive communist state , the authors said			0
@entity0 's @entity323 in @entity51 , @entity52 , contributed to this report .			0

study charts discrimination , violence , intimidation in 198 countries , territories
it looks at how legal restrictions , social tensions restrict freedom of religion
@entity211 rates lowest in religious legal controls , social conflict among 25 largest nations
@entity221 , @entity55 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 score well in religious freedom ; @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 do n't
