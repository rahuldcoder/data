-- a lone bugler sounding the traditional military farewell " @entity3 " marked the arrival wednesday in the @entity5 of the first dead from the crash of @entity7 17			1
the grieving nation then held a moment of silence to honor those killed in the crash of the jetliner , downed last week by a suspected surface - to - air missile over war - torn eastern @entity14			1
in a ceremony rich with martial symbolism -- from saluting soldiers to the haunting tune used to send war dead to their rest -- 40 simple wooden caskets were solemnly unloaded from two military planes			2
soldiers then walked them to waiting hearses and lowered them inside before rendering a final salute			0
the only sounds were the hushed orders of soldiers and a whipping wind			0
a long line of hearses , accompanied by police , carried the remains slowly toward a @entity5 military base in @entity35 , where forensic investigators will begin the grim work of identifying them			1
thousands of @entity5 residents lined roads and overpasses along parts of the route to pay respects to the dead			1
some applauded as the hearses finally passed through the base gates , some tossed flowers on the vehicles			2
others stood silently , red - eyed			2
" the @entity5 are in shock , and @entity35 , as well , " said the city 's mayor , @entity52			1
@entity55 , whose two nephews were among the 298 people killed in the crash , called the ceremony " very moving and a beautiful tribute			0
" " it feels like we 're just a big grieving family , and that somewhat helps in coping with this horrible , devastating event , " he told @entity0 's @entity61			0
@entity66 watched the procession on tv in @entity69 , still wondering where the remains of his brother - in - law , @entity71 , might be			1
" it 's totally surreal			1
it was the weirdest feeling , knowing that my brother - in - law could be in one of those caskets			1
i just found myself wanting him to be there , but at the same time , that 's too selfish , " @entity66 said , adding that he hopes the victims who were children were the ones landing in the @entity5 first			1
@entity66 said his sister , @entity71 's wife , also watched the procession			1
" she 's destroyed , " he said , and her son has said his whole body is sore from crying			0
at this point , he said , his family only knows that @entity71 , a helicopter rescue pilot who had recently moved to @entity7 with his family , was sitting in business class on @entity95 -- a part of the plane that reportedly did n't sustain as much damage			0
" we can only hope that things will work out for us , and we can get @entity71 home and start the grieving process			0
... my sister , she has no hope			0
it 's about putting the left foot in front of the right , " he said			2
the somber ceremony in @entity113 followed a moving and meaningful send - off in @entity14			0
there , white - gloved @entity14 soldiers respectfully carried the bodies of the victims to the aircraft that flew them home to a waiting @entity5 king and queen on the nation 's official day of mourning			1
the honors afforded the remains contrasted sharply with how they were first treated in death -- blown out of the sky , then allowed to remain exposed to the elements for days			0
in some cases , furious @entity5 officials say , they were stripped of their personal belongings			2
of the 298 people who died aboard @entity95 , 193 were @entity5 citizens , and it was impossible to miss the signs that the @entity5 was a nation in mourning wednesday			2
flags were flown at half - staff , and the nation 's iconic windmills were placed in " mourning position " with wings tilted to the right			2
courts suspended all trials , and even commercials were pulled from @entity5 television and radio			2
buses and trains were to stop on roads nationwide during the moment of silence , and landings at @entity156 's schipol airport were paused as a sign of respect			0
in the evening , hundreds attended a memorial service at @entity161 in @entity162			0
light will break through , " one relative of a family killed in the crash told mourners			0
the commemorations come amid continued confusion over who shot the plane down , and why , and what may have happened to the evidence where the plane fell to fields deep in eastern @entity14 territory controlled by @entity179 rebels			0
" there is a lot of anger			2
this was a crime , and people want to make sure that this crime is being solved , " said @entity183 , a @entity5 journalist who covered wednesday 's ceremony			1
" but today was really a day for grief , and i think tomorrow and the next few days , then that 's really a new phase starting			1
" ' black boxes ' arrive in @entity193 it took days for @entity14 rebels who control the area of the crash site to hand over the bodies and the airliner 's black boxes to @entity202 officials			1
now , the bodies are at a @entity5 military base , and the voice and flight data recorders are in @entity193 for what will be a detailed scouring by international analysts			1
investigators wednesday found that the cockpit voice recorder was damaged , but its memory was intact			0
there was no sign of tampering			0
but @entity5 crash investigators leading the inquiry said wednesday they still do n't have everything they need			1
" at the time of writing , the investigators have not yet been able to visit the site of the crash and conduct their investigation under safe conditions , " the @entity220 said in a statement wednesday			2
" in order to conduct an effective investigation , the investigators must have the opportunity to move around the entire investigation site freely , investigate materials and traces from up close and secure them for further study where necessary , " the board said			0
" at present , the investigators ' safety has not been guaranteed			0
" instead , investigators are working in @entity242 and in the @entity5 using photos and other sources of information , the board said			2
given conditions at the crash site , which sits essentially in the middle of a war zone , it 's impossible to say when investigators might get the access they want			1
a @entity193 security source expressed concern to @entity0 's @entity255 on wednesday about potential debris - tampering at the crash site			1
conversations intercepted by @entity14 intelligence , which @entity193 security officials find persuasive , include separatists stating that they had possession of an sa - 11 ( buk missile system ) as early as monday , july 14 , the source said			0
the separatists were also talking about moving bodies , passing black boxes to @entity268 and a plan to scatter parts of other aircraft on the site , according to the source			2
and while the black boxes are now in the hands of skilled investigators who are working hard to unspool the crucial information contained in them , it may take weeks for that analysis to yield results , the safety board said			0
similarly , work to identify the bodies may take weeks or even months , @entity5 prime minister @entity281 said			1
some bodies unaccounted for officials gave conflicting reports about how many bodies were on the train that carried them from the crash site to the @entity14 city of @entity291 , where they left for the @entity5 on wednesday			1
and it was unclear how many bodies were inside the 40 caskets transported to the @entity5			1
@entity202 official @entity296 , who traveled on the train with the remains , said there were 282 corpses and 87 body parts aboard -- the same tally @entity14 officials earlier gave to describe the remains recovered from the crash site			1
but @entity5 investigators only confirmed there were at least 200 bodies transported from the crash site , said @entity309 , head of the @entity5 delegation			1
another @entity5 official said investigators were still going through the train cars and it was possible that all the crash victims were on the train			1
but officials said monday that at the least , the bodies of 16 people were still unaccounted for			0
their remains may still be scattered across a debris field spanning several miles			0
as they combed the crash site on wednesday , monitors from the @entity325 and @entity202 experts searched for human remains			1
they spotted some in one location , he said			0
" there 's a lot of heavy debris still out there , " spokesman @entity336 said , " and we 're not quite sure what could be underneath			2
" the crash site was eerily calm on wednesday			1
" it 's like everyone picked up and left , " he said			1
a team of about 15 observers and @entity202 experts are doing everything they can , he said			0
" but we feel somewhat on our own right now , " @entity336 said			0
" and as i 've said many times , there are people far better placed and trained than we are to do this very specialized type of work			0
" who are @entity14 's @entity179 rebels ? @entity14 president : the world must choose sides so much we do n't know -- five unanswered questions who were the victims ? should jet have flown over @entity14 ? @entity363 and @entity364 reported and wrote from @entity365			0
@entity0 's @entity366 , @entity367 , @entity368 , @entity369 , @entity370 , @entity371 , @entity372 , @entity373 , @entity374 and @entity375 contributed to this report .			0
