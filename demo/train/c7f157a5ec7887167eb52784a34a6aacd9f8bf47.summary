-- as migrant children continue to cross the border into the @entity5 , dominating the immigration debate this summer , @entity2 gov. @entity1 says that 's a sideshow and maintains that the real issue at the border is the wave of criminals who have crossed over it			1
sen. @entity13 , @entity14 , said sunday morning on @entity16 's " @entity15 " that politicians in @entity19 " have to deal with the immediate crisis right now , " referring to the migrant children border crossings			1
but @entity1 said on @entity0 's " @entity21 " that the influx of unaccompanied minors crossing the border , mostly into @entity2 , is a " side issue			1
" numerous politicians have said the 62,000 unaccompanied minors who have crossed into @entity2 is a humanitarian crisis			1
the situation is overloading holding facilities and taxing the immigration system -- all of which is costing an additional hundreds of millions of tax payer dollars			0
@entity1 , meanwhile , said he is " substantially more concerned about " criminals crossing a porous border			1
" that 's the real issue here , and one that all too often gets deflected by the conversation about unaccompanied minor children , " he said sunday			2
criminal border - crossers is a theme @entity1 has been hitting since he announced in late july that he would send up to 1,000 @entity43 troops to the border to help " combat " crime			1
he restated that position sunday in an interview with @entity0 's @entity49			0
" we 'll continue to do what we have to do to keep our citizens safe , " he said			0
once again , he said that criminals in the @entity5 illegally are responsible for 3,000 homicides and nearly 8,000 sexual assaults since 2008			0
but @entity57 @entity2 fact - checked the statistics and concluded that the statement " is both incorrect and ridiculous			1
" @entity1 told @entity49 he stands by those statistics			1
@entity1 sending @entity43 troops to border @entity1 's crime statistics have been debunked , the rate of undocumented immigrants crossing the border is at its lowest since the early 1980s and most other politicians are focused on the fact that more than twice as many migrant children crossed the border this year than last			1
so why is @entity1 focusing on criminals ? @entity72 strategist @entity71 , whose job it is to analyze and craft @entity72 political strategy , said she has " no idea " why @entity1 is focused on crime			1
" i had a hard time following his train of thought , " she added			0
but @entity80 strategist @entity80 said @entity1 focuses on the criminal component of the border issue because it is one component of the larger problem at the border			1
" the ( @entity88 ) administration 's weak stand over the past six years produced an environment where exactly this type of crisis unfurls , " she said			0
@entity1 , whose term is up this year , is considering another run at the @entity72 presidential nomination in 2016			2
his previous @entity96 campaign was crippled partly because of the @entity72 voter base 's displeasure with a law he signed more than a decade ago giving children of undocumented immigrants in - state college tuition			2
in addition to violent criminals , @entity1 indicated sunday that terrorists are using a porous southern border to enter the @entity5			1
his statement was backed up by rep. @entity107 , chairman of the @entity108 , who said on " @entity21 , " that " we believe ( people who ) are connected in some way with terrorist organizations at least having the understanding ... it is a weakness in our national security			0
" it 's the same argument that was made after the 9 - 11 terrorist attacks and spurred the creation of the @entity119 and doubling the amount spent on border security and border patrol agents			0
@entity1 's focus , however , has evolved over the course of the debate over migrant youths			2
just one month ago , during a congressional hearing held near the border , @entity1 sounded a different tune			1
he lectured members of @entity131 that they need to work with president @entity88 to address the influx of unaccompanied minors			0
" the president has bypassed @entity131 -- and maybe he could and should , i do n't know , i 'm not going to wade in -- but this is the one time that i really think the president does need all of you , @entity136 and @entity72 alike , to be working with you and reaching out , " he said on july 3			0
but since then , @entity1 has chosen to focus solely on the need for greater border security and protection to tamp down on crime and illegal border crossings , even though the total number of undocumented immigrants has mostly declined			1
while the number of youths has more than doubled in just one year , the total number of immigrants had continued to drop over the past eight years to about 400,000 , compared with about 1 million each year from 1983 until 2006			0
by focusing only on border security , @entity1 safely toes the @entity72 position and is in line with many @entity5			2
on the issue of immigration since the migrant youth crisis , polling shows @entity5 ' priorities have shifted			2
according to a july @entity0 / @entity158 poll , 51 % now say the government 's focus on immigration policy should be formulating a plan to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants rather than dealing with the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants who are here			0
but the issue of children is more complicated			2
the same poll found contradictions in people 's opinions			0
while 54 % of respondents supported spending " several billion dollars " to care for the children while they waited an immigration judge , 62 % of the same people surveyed also supported a bill that would make it easier to deport them .			0

many call the border situation a humanitarian crisis ; @entity2 gov. @entity1 calls it a " side issue "
he is more focused on criminals crossing the border than the flood of children
@entity57 said his statistics about undocumented criminals are incorrect
