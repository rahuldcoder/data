@entity0 said in a report on wednesday			0
@entity7 says @entity4 used white phosphorus shells over populated areas in @entity8			1
" in @entity8 , the @entity4 military did n't just use white phosphorus in open areas as a screen for its troops , " said @entity14 , a @entity7 senior emergencies researcher			1
" it fired white phosphorus repeatedly over densely populated areas , even when its troops were n't in the area and safer smoke shells were available			1
as a result , civilians needlessly suffered and died			0
" entitled " @entity27 : @entity4 's @entity28 of @entity29 in @entity8 , " the 71 - page report provides " witness accounts " and " presents ballistics evidence , photographs , and satellite imagery , as well as documents from the @entity4 military and government			1
" @entity7 is an independent international organization dedicated to defending and protecting human rights			1
the group urged @entity4 and the @entity40 to investigate the attacks			1
@entity4 should prosecute those who carried them out and the @entity40 government , which supplied @entity4 , should look into the issue			1
@entity7 said white phosphorous was a chemical substance dispersed in artillery shells , bombs and rockets , used primarily to obscure military operations			1
" ( while ) it is not considered a chemical weapon and is not banned per se , it ignites and burns on contact with oxygen and creates a smokescreen at night or during the day to mask the visual movement of troops			0
" it also interferes with infra - red optics and weapon - tracking systems , thus protecting military forces from guided weapons such as anti-tank missiles			0
when @entity29 comes into contact with people or objects , though , it creates an intense and persistent burn			1
it can also be used as a weapon against military targets , " the group said			2
in response , the @entity4 military said " smoke shells are not an incendiary weapon " and defended its actions			1
the @entity76 said it was close to completing its probe into " the use of ammunition containing elements of phosphorous			0
" " ( the invesitgation ) is dealing with the use of ammunition containing elements of phosphorous , including , among others , the 155mm smoke shells which were referred to in the @entity7 report			1
this type of ammunition disperses in the atmosphere and creates an effective smoke screen			0
it is used by many @entity98 armies			0
" it is already possible to conclude that the @entity76 's use of smoke shells was in accordance with international law			2
these shells were used for specific operational needs only and in accord with international humanitarian law			2
the claim that smoke shells were used indiscriminately , or to threaten the civilian population , is baseless , " the @entity76 said			2
it said " that weapons intended for screening are not classed as incendiary weapons			0
" but @entity14 said past @entity76 investigations into allegations of wrongdoing suggest their inquiry would be neither thorough nor impartial			0
" that 's why an international investigation is required into serious laws of war violations by all parties			2
" for the needless civilian deaths caused by white phosphorus , senior commanders should be held to account , " @entity14 said			2
the report said white phosphorus munitions were n't illegal when deployed properly in open areas , but it determined that the @entity76 repeatedly used them " unlawfully over populated neighborhoods , killing and wounding civilians and damaging civilian structures , including a school , a market , a humanitarian aid warehouse and a hospital			0
" " first , the repeated use of air - burst white phosphorus in populated areas until the last days of the operation reveals a pattern or policy of conduct rather than incidental or accidental usage			0
second , the @entity76 was well aware of the effects of white phosphorus and the dangers it poses to civilians			0
third , the @entity76 failed to use safer available alternatives for smokescreens , " the report said			0
a medical report prepared during the recent hostilities by the @entity156 said that white phosphorus " can cause serious injury and death when it comes into contact with the skin , is inhaled or is swallowed			0
" the report said that the @entity76 could have used a non-lethal smoke shells produced by an @entity4 company if it wanted to provide a " smokescreen " for its troops			1
@entity4 launched the offensive in late december to take on militants from @entity170 , who had been shelling southern @entity4 communities for months from @entity8			1
the offensive , called @entity173 , was launched december 27 and ended january 17 with a cease - fire			0
of the 1,453 people estimated killed in the conflict , 1,440 were @entity179 , including 431 children and 114 women , a @entity176 report recently said			0
the 13 @entity4 killed included three civilians and six soldiers killed by @entity170 , and four soldiers killed by friendly fire , it said			2
@entity7 also said it found no evidence that the @entity170 militants @entity4 was targeting in @entity8 were using human shields " in the vicinity at the time of the attacks			1
" @entity4 has said @entity170 militants used civilians as human shields and fought from civilian locations , @entity7 points out			1
" in some areas @entity179 fighters appear to have been present , but this does not justify the indiscriminate use of white phosphorus in a populated area			2

@entity4 's use of phosphorus shells over during @entity8 offensive " indiscriminate "
@entity7 says shelling " evidence of war crimes "
group says phosphorus shells cause an " intense and persistent burn "
