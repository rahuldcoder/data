@entity0 -- as the country goes into the weekend with the government shut down and neither side talking , there seems to be little hope for breaking the impasse any time soon			1
and with the days ticking down toward the moment the country runs out of options to meet its debt obligations , the head - butting over funding the government might force @entity13 to try to work out a deal to get it running again and raise the debt ceiling at the same time			2
@entity1 chief national correspondent @entity17 and chief political correspondent @entity18 were asked about the state of play as we end a tumultuous week as well what next week might look like			0
q : @entity1 and others reported that @entity24 speaker @entity23 said to @entity25 in private meetings that he will get something passed to avoid defaulting on the @entity29 financial obligations , even if it takes putting something together that would attract @entity31			1
did he blink ? @entity17 : his top aides are saying there 's no dramatic shift here			2
but the speaker 's meeting in small groups with rank - and - file lawmakers			2
@entity23 knows when he goes into a meeting like that it 's going to leak out			1
what is he doing ? he 's sending an early signal that , ladies and gentlemen of the @entity25 caucus , ' we are not going to be part of defaulting			1
' his obituary is already going to read he was the leader of a bizarre three - ring circus on @entity52			0
he does n't want to say he was the speaker when the government for the first time defaulted			0
there 's still a huge question of how you get there , though , because the speaker will continue to insist no raising the debt ceiling without getting something from the administration -- on spending cuts , on spending levels , on reforms in the most expensive government programs			2
and the president , of course , is on the record saying ' i wo n't negotiate			0
' you can reconcile those two positions by doing it in a couple of sequenced steps			0
it 's an optimistic statement from the speaker that we wo n't default , but getting from " a " to the finish line is still complicated			1
read more : @entity24 @entity25 say shutdown likely to drag on q : are we talking about a grand bargain again ? it 's hard to believe that could happen this time around -- things have gone from bad to worse in terms of relations between these two parties ? @entity17 : sometimes at the bleakest moment is when something can be pulled -- a rabbit you pull out of a hat , if you will			1
however , when you talk to people in both parties and top aides close to all of the people involved , from the @entity24 to the @entity25 and the @entity31 on @entity52 , most just do n't see an environment because of the distrust , because of the looming political calendar of 2014 for a big grand bargain that does @entity105 , @entity106 , tax reform , other entitlements , other spending cuts in the government			1
is there a possibility of a smaller bargain that gets some of the things @entity25 want in terms of savings in @entity105 and @entity106 , some other spending cuts ? that is possible in these separate budget agreements			1
the question is can you get the government re-opened , raise the debt ceiling and then do those things ? will the @entity25 trust the democrats to do that ? or because of the suspicions , will you have the revolt ? a lot of the fight has been about strategy and many people will say that 's their frustration with @entity0 , they 're more concerned about the political win rather than the ramifications and the ripple effect on the economy and the country			1
but the reality is it is about strategy			0
q : @entity145 's and @entity147 's hot mic moment was instructive in showing the disconnect between what they are supposed to be doing and what they want to be doing			2
what does it mean to you to overhear this ? @entity18 : it certainly is a signal to the @entity24			2
we had heard @entity147 say publicly ' we 're not going to be able to get rid of @entity159			0
' but it 's a great starting position			2
we have had , in particular in the @entity162 , a lot of @entity25 senators saying shutting down the government is a bad idea , it wo n't work for republicans politically			1
this tells me that they are in a position that the @entity162 does n't want to be in			0
it tells me that they are hearing privately and publicly from the president ' no negotiations , ' which probably is more troublesome in terms of there really is n't anything going on			0
we kept thinking there was -- that maybe somewhere people were talking about a compromise and clearly that 's not happening			2
so , what republicans believe is that that particular stance -- we 're not going to negotiate on anything -- is not going to survive the test of public will			0
so far , what we see is republicans are taking the bulk of the blame			0
we 'll see if that shifts			0
q : why is @entity23 not bringing up this vote for a resolution ? what do you believe is behind it ? is he not doing this because he 's worried about losing face or his job ? why is there no vote ? @entity18 : i want to put something -- not particularly in this conversation -- but something we do n't discuss all the time but that is there may not be the votes there			1
i talked to @entity215 a couple weeks ago , and i said , ' do you like the @entity217 ? i mean , if the @entity24 put -- if @entity23 -- put just a straight old temporary spending resolution , do you like it ? ' she said , ' no. there 's too many cuts in it			1
' there are @entity31 who do n't like the @entity217 , even plain without anything attached to it			1
there are republicans that are always going to vote against it because it does n't do anything about @entity159 , should a clean @entity217 come up			0
there may not be the votes at the moment			2
having said that , certainly the main impetus is that his caucus is not with him at this point			0
i would also suggest it 's not just the 35 or 40 in the tea party caucus			1
they have been pretty good at holding together			0
this is more than 40 congressmen at this point			0
now we 're beginning to see some fractures and maybe a dozen @entity24 @entity25 looking for a way out , but they 've held force with not just the tea party , although it does seem tea party driven , obviously			1
q : on the debt ceiling , what are you hearing -- on the one hand , rep. @entity251 says it 's not that big a deal , that it 's false demagoguery			0
on the other , @entity23 says he wo n't let the country default on its obligations			1
do they get that this is a big deal ? @entity18 : i 'm hearing nobody wants to find out			0
the debt ceiling really has been , from economists to a number of folks on @entity52 , they just look at it and say , this really would be disaster on the @entity29 economy , on the world economy			0
even those who say , ' i do n't know because i 'm not an economist , ' say , ' i do n't want to find out			0
' what we 're hearing from @entity23 i think certainly substantiates all of that			1
this is not something that he 's going to allow to happen , even if it means he has to rely on @entity31 votes			1
that 's something for the @entity25 speaker of the @entity24 to say : " even if i have to get @entity31 to do it , we 're not going to allow the debt ceiling not to go up			1

@entity23 " leak " was a signal to his caucus that he 's not going to be the one to put country into default
*atmosphere* in @entity0 is too toxic to hope for a " grand bargain "
it 's possible that @entity23 might not get enough @entity31 votes even if he drops @entity25 demands
