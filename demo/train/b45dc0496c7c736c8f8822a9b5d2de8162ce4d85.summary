@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's not everyday someone asks you if you 'd be prepared to ride in a fighter jet but when my producer put the question to me several weeks ago i jumped at it			1
roaring engines , heat haze on the tarmac , fighter pilots in @entity16 sunglasses : what 's not to like ? the @entity18 was offering @entity2 rare access to its @entity20 -- a training fighter developed in @entity1 in conjunction with @entity24 military contractor @entity22			1
in 1997 , just before the @entity28 financial crisis hit , the government in @entity26 made a decision to develop its aerospace industry			2
the intention was to develop and produce military aircraft to protect the nation 's national security and create a lucrative export industry			2
the @entity20 is their first supersonic training fighter jet			1
@entity37 has already purchased 16 and at least half a dozen other countries , including the @entity24 , are also interested			1
@entity39 but my @entity39 moment in this $ 25 million dollar jet would have to wait until i completed a tough preparatory course at the @entity44 based in @entity0			1
this is where the country 's fighter pilots come to train			1
a group of instructors greet us and take us into a briefing room where they run through the checklist for the next four hours			2
then after a series of medical questions , my blood pressure is tested and i 'm put into a contraption similar to the " @entity59 , " an amusement park ride i went on as a kid that spins and sucks you to the wall , to test my body 's aptitude for the pressures of flying at supersonic speeds			2
" if you do n't pass @entity76 in the simulator you wo n't be able to go up in the fighter jet , " my instructor informs me matter - of - factly , referring to the simulator 's force of acceleration -- six times that of the normal force of gravity			1
extreme forces dressed in my pilot 's fatigues , i follow the instructor along the long corridor to a room housing an enormous contraption that looked like something belonging @entity87			1
it was a capsule suspended on a long arm pinned to the floor in the middle of room			2
the basic idea was that it would spin really fast in one direction creating extreme forces of gravity i would have to endure while strapped in			1
the instructor runs through the bizarre breathing exercises required to help endure the g - forces and stop me blacking out			1
" do this ... say the word ' hick ' ... hold your breath for 3 seconds ... then quick breaths in and out			1
now you practice , " he orders			2
my attempt results in a choking sound that send me into a fit of giggles , provoking a concerned look from my instructor			2
after reassuring him that i would keep practicing , i climb the stairs of the simulator and am strapped into the seat with my helmet on			1
ahead of me on the screen , i 'm presented with an enormous virtual runway , the horizon and a vast blue sky spanning 270 degrees			0
i was ready to fly			0
at least that 's what i thought			0
take off the commander in the control room speaks to me through my headset			0
he can see me in his monitor			0
" now do n't forget to clench your body and breathe , " he says			0
the capsule starts moving as a computer - generated voice counts down to " take off			1
" suddenly i 'm spinning and there 's an enormous weight on my body			0
i 'm trying to breathe but the pressure is overwhelming			0
then the room goes black and my head jolts forward -- i 've lost consciousness			0
the simulator grinds to a halt , and i awaken to the concerned voice of my instructor			1
" are you alright ? @entity144 can you hear me ? " i come to and ask him what happened			1
" you got to @entity147 but you only lasted two seconds before you blacked out , " he informs me			1
" you need to last 20 seconds to pass the test			1
" as i climb out of the simulator feeling sick , the instructor smiles at me with a knowing look			2
" do n't worry this is normal			0
everyone blacks out the first time			0
you 'll get it on the next go -- trust me			0
" utter dread twenty minutes later i 'm back in the simulator but this time there 's no sense of excitement , just utter dread			2
i take deep breaths as the capsule picks up speed			0
" 3,2,1 ... @entity167 ... breathe , @entity144 keep breathing ! " my instructor 's voice commands			1
i 'm trying to breathe but it feels like a building has collapsed on my chest			0
i 'm gritting my teeth , clenching my body , desperately trying to fight the g - forces and stop the blood rushing from my brain but i ca n't hold on			1
i black out again -- this time my eyes roll back in my head			0
" @entity144 , @entity144 are you ok ? that was better ... you got to 10 seconds , " the voice in the control room says			1
only 10 seconds ? how the hell am i going to do this ? as i climb down from the simulator with my legs shaking , the instructor suggests a break and some other tests			1
i head for a pressure chamber where i have to sit for 40 minutes breathing through a mask to simulate a climb to 25,000 feet			0
but i 'm feeling cold , struggling to breathe , feeling anxious and desperately fighting the panic that wants to invade my mind and body			0
once we reach the desired altitude , the control room asks me to write my name continuously on a piece of paper			0
by the seventh attempt my writing looks like that of a five year old			0
i have no control over my hand and i feel like vomiting			0
but all i can think about is having to get back in the simulator and battle the g - forces			1
the team decides that i should watch the video of myself during the g - force test to see what i 'm doing wrong			1
i 'm shocked as i watch the footage of me blacking out -- it 's disturbing			0
first test passed determined not to let this happen again i climb back in the simulator			2
" are you ready @entity144 ? let 's do @entity221 and see if you can make it , " the voice from the control room suggests			1
one less g could make the difference			0
my heart is racing -- i have no choice -- i have to do this			0
the capsule starts moving and the computer - generated voice is back again			2
" 3,2,1 ... " the spinning becomes intense within seconds			2
" you 're at @entity233 , let 's go to @entity235 ... push back @entity144 ... hold it , breathe , push back ! " the seconds pass so slowly , the capsule feels like it 's spinning out of control and i 'm seeing stars			1
suddenly the instructor yells " @entity242 ! @entity144 you 've made it			1
you held on for 23 seconds			2
good job ! " i 'm overwhelmed with relief			0
i finally passed the test and conquered my fear			0
but the real test was still to come -- up in the heavens			0
