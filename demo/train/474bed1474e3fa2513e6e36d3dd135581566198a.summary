-- @entity1 : it 's not just for cute cats anymore			1
the @entity5 's leading video site is now the home of a new kind of interactive visual journalism , where " citizen witnesses " are reaching millions of people with the news of the day , according to a new report from the @entity13			1
a prime example was the tsunami that hit @entity16 in march 2011			2
in the week following the earthquake that caused the deadly wave , the 20 most - watched news videos on @entity1 received 96 million views , according to the report			1
most of that footage came not from professionals but from users who were in the middle of the disaster that killed more than 18,000 people			0
" citizens are creating their own videos about news and posting them , " read the report released monday			2
" they are also actively sharing news videos produced by journalism professionals			1
and news organizations are taking advantage of citizen content and incorporating it into their journalism			0
" consumers , in turn , seem to be embracing the interplay in what they watch and share , creating a new kind of television news			0
" in effect , @entity13 describes an emerging partnership of sorts between traditional media outlets and citizen journalists			0
while many of the tsunami videos were user - generated , they received most of their views after being shared by professional outlets on the site , the report said			1
@entity0 has officially embraced citizen journalism since 2006 with @entity57 , which encourages users around the world to share news , opinions , images and video on a wide range of topics			0
the second annual @entity66 this month honored an ireporter 's eyewitness footage of the 2011 @entity69 , among other video clips			0
the @entity13 's @entity71 studied 15 months ' worth of news videos between january 2011 and march 2012 , tracking the five most popular videos each week in the " @entity76 " channel on @entity1			1
" the data reveal that a complex , symbiotic relationship has developed between citizens and news organizations on @entity1 , a relationship that comes close to the continuous journalistic ' dialogue ' many observers predicted would become the new journalism online , " the report said			1
among the study 's findings : video of natural disasters tends to draw the most attention			0
news events outside the @entity93 topped the list			1
the three most - viewed topics were the tsunami , @entity98 elections and unrest in the @entity100			1
as @entity13 notes , 70 % of @entity1 's traffic comes from outside the @entity93			1
more than one - third ( 39 % ) of the top videos were clearly citizen - generated and another 51 % -- making a whopping 90 % of all videos studied -- came from news organizations but included some user - created content			0
personalities do n't seem to be a big deal for @entity1 news seekers			2
no individual appeared in more than 5 % of the top news videos , with president @entity111 topping the list by appearing in 4 %			2
while the numbers are impressive , they still pale in comparison to the number of viewers of traditional television news			0
the report compares the 96 million - view week for tsunami videos to the roughly 22 million people who watch network news shows each evening			2
( that 's 154 million over a seven - day period , and does n't include cable or local news			0
) the difference , @entity13 notes , is that sites such as @entity1 provide for " a la carte " news , letting users choose their own programming			1
the report does note one potentially troubling aspect of @entity1 news sharing			2
giving credit for videos , the report said , can get blurry , a problem stemming from a lack of clear ethical guidelines			0
researchers found instances of traditional news sites apparently using citizen - created videos without clearly attributing them as well as citizens posting copyrighted material without permission			1
" all this creates the potential for news to be manufactured , or even falsified , without giving audiences much ability to know who produced it or how to verify it , " the report said .			0
