the strategist in charge of electing a @entity4 @entity3 majority thanked @entity5 on thursday for keeping president @entity6 on the sidelines and building their campaigns around women 's issues instead of making an economic argument			1
@entity12 , the executive director of the @entity13 , told reporters in a postmortem session that @entity5 " sidelined their best messenger " by running from @entity6			1
" they were so focused on independents that they forgot they had a base , " @entity12 said of @entity5 campaigns			1
" they left their base behind			0
they became @entity4 - lite			2
" the " war on women " message that permeated so many @entity5 campaigns up and down the ballot " was a mistake , " @entity12 said — it used " a tactic as a strategy			1
" he praised @entity4 candidates for being " proactive and having something to say			2
" " i ca n't remember a @entity36 who spent any kind of money in a significant way talking about the economy , " he said			0
" if i had a choice between talking about the number one issue we saw in every single poll , and talking about a single issue , i would be talking about the number one issue			2
" not all @entity5 campaigns ran single - issue campaigns			1
a number of @entity5 , especially those in the party 's progressive and labor wings of the party , have highlighted tuesday winners like @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60 in @entity61 and @entity62 in @entity63 as candidates who talked about women 's issues but also weaved the debate into a larger economic theme			1
but even those campaigns were careful to avoid being seen as too close to the president			0
@entity12 and @entity13 communications director @entity70 agreed that @entity6 was a political lightning rod for @entity5 — especially late in the campaign			1
but they said they were baffled that their opponents did n't use him to rally the base throughout the year and make an argument about the economic successes of the @entity6 administration -- particularly in the purple states of @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			2
" if you are running to @entity89 's campaign , there is an argument to be made that unemployment was higher when he took office , " @entity70 said			0
" there is an argument that gas prices were higher when he took office			0
but they never made it			0
they stuck to a flawed strategy that talked about birth control and abortion through the election			0
that was something we never understood			0
