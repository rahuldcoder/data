@entity0 -- conservationists are optimistic @entity0 will move to destroy its huge stockpile of confiscated ivory -- believed to be one of the world 's biggest -- following @entity7 's landmark destruction of six tons of tusks and ivory sculptures this week			1
@entity0 , one of the principal gateways to mainland @entity7 , has previously opted not to destroy its stockpile of the illegal " white gold " -- most of which is seized en route to the mainland -- opting instead to hold it in secret warehouses , sending small amounts to schools for educational purposes			1
@entity7 is the world 's largest ivory market , accounting for an estimated 70 % of global consumption , according to the @entity26 ( @entity26 )			1
but a spokeswoman for @entity0 's @entity28 said a committee would consider alternate means of dealing with the stockpile of " about 30 tons " of contraband ivory held by the @entity33 ( @entity34 ) , a hub of the global ivory trade , at a meeting later this month			1
the department had been trialing means of destroying ivory , including incineration , she said			0
activists are hopeful @entity0 will be encouraged to emulate the recent example of @entity7 , which took the symbolic gesture of crushing of tons of ivory in the southern @entity49 province monday			1
the public demolition , which took place before diplomats , conservationists and media , came a month after @entity7 pledged at an @entity55 in @entity56 to take action to combat ivory trading			2
the quantity destroyed by @entity7 -- the first occasion the superpower has destroyed any of its stockpile -- amounted to about one - sixth of the illegal ivory confiscated worldwide in 2012 , according to @entity26 estimates			1
" the government of @entity7 took a stand finally on the issue and made a symbolic gesture to say to the world they want to join the global fight against the illegal wildlife trade , " said activist @entity65 of lobby group @entity0 for elephants			1
given @entity0 's close relationship with @entity7 and with key trading partner the @entity76 , which similarly destroyed its entire 6 - ton stockpile of ivory in november , " i do n't very well see how ( @entity0 ) can not " follow suit , he said			1
the destruction of seized ivory hordes has also taken place in the @entity84 , @entity85 , and @entity86 in recent years			0
" there 's a bit of a pattern emerging , a global trend now to get rid of the ivory stockpiles , " said @entity65 , adding that @entity0 's trove would be by far the largest to be destroyed			2

according to the convention on @entity107 , a large amount of confiscated @entity110 ivory goes missing every year			0
more crucially , said @entity65 , public destruction also sends a powerful message to potential buyers			0
" it sends a really strong signal to consumers in @entity7 that it 's morally reprehensible -- it 's the wrong thing to do , and by buying illegal wildlife products , they 're directly contributing to the poaching crisis in @entity110 , " he said			0
a survey of 900 middle and upper middle class @entity7 , commissioned by @entity122 last year , found nearly 60 % of respondents believed that strong government directives not to purchase ivory would be the most effective way to counter the trade			0
the survey also found that @entity7 consumers associated ivory products with luxury and prestige			0
according to @entity133 , special assistant to the @entity134 at the @entity26 , a rise in demand from @entity137 , and especially @entity7 , in recent years has fueled the black market and put increasing pressure on @entity110 elephants in the wild			2
the elephant population in @entity110 has now shrunk to around half a million , from 1.2 million in 1980			0
nearly one hundred @entity110 elephants are killed for their tusks every day , according to the @entity145			0
@entity65 said that incinerating , not merely crushing , the ivory was a key consideration , as the crushing process would chunks of ivory large enough that they could still be worked into trinkets and returned to the ivory market			0
