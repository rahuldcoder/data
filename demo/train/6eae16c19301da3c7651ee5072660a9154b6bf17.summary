-- pour yourself a cold martini , make sure it 's extra dry , put some classic jazz on the stereo , a mournful saxophone is a must , and settle in with one of the best - reviewed novels of the year , " @entity9			1
" written by first - time novelist @entity11 , a principal at a @entity13 investment firm , the book has shot up the best - seller charts and is drawing rave reviews from critics			1
it 's a nostalgic love letter to @entity18 of the late ' 30s , a novel of manners with lofty aspirations that evokes some of the classics of @entity24 literature			1
the story unfolds largely in flashback , set on @entity27 in @entity13 1937			1
the @entity28 is over , the depression in its final days , @entity30 just over the horizon			2
at its outset , there is a budding love triangle between @entity35 , that 's " kon - tent , like the state of being " ; her boardinghouse roommate , eve ; and a handsome banker , @entity39 , but an unexpected accident sends the story in a more serious direction			1
@entity35 is the narrator and the wry heart of this novel			2
she 's a young woman of " poise and purpose			2
" @entity49 - born , the daughter of immigrant laborers , she works in a @entity51 secretarial pool though aspires to much more			2
alongside a supporting cast with @entity53 nicknames like @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , @entity35 navigates her way through @entity13 jazz clubs and @entity60 cocktail parties and into the upper echelons of @entity18 society			1
the novel takes its title from young @entity66 's " @entity65 " ; you 'll find all 110 of them in the novel 's appendix			0
these rules are described as " a do - it - yourself charm school			2
a sort of @entity74 150 years ahead of its time			2
" @entity11 gives a knowing nod to some classic @entity24 authors , no less than @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 among them , but this book is much more than an homage			1
it 's a discourse on wealth and privilege , aspirations and envy , loyalty and reinventing oneself and how a chance encounter or a snap decision made at a young age can shape your life for decades to come			1
@entity0 recently spoke to @entity11 about his bestselling novel			1
the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : you 're a 46 - year - old investment professional			1
what led you to write your first novel ? @entity11 : i 've been writing fiction since i was a kid			1
from the age of 15 to 25 , i probably wrote more than 50 short stories , one of which was published in " the @entity108 " in 1989			0
then in my late 30s and early 40s , i wrote a novel set in the farmlands of @entity111 , which i stuck in a drawer			1
so when i finished the manuscript for " @entity9 , " it was the first thing i had submitted for publication in almost 20 years			1
one reason for the long hiatus is that i have been an investment professional since my mid- 20s			2
my personal challenge as an artist has been having a day job which is intellectually satisfying and fun -- and thus can easily supplant the desire to make art. but the benefit of having that career has been that i could write without an overwhelming sense of urgency to be published			0
i could just keep refining my craft until i was convinced i had something worth sharing			0
@entity0 : what made you choose @entity18 in 1938 as the setting for your novel ? @entity11 : while i began writing " @entity9 " in 2006 , the genesis of the book dates back to the early 1990s , when i happened upon a copy of " many are called , " the collection of portraits that @entity139 took on the @entity18 subways in the late 1930s with a hidden camera			1
at the time , i primarily knew of @entity139 ' iconic depression - era photographs of rural @entity24 , such as those that appear in " @entity146 " : the tilting clapboard houses , weathered signs , stalwart women in summer dresses , but this was the first i 'd seen of his urban work			1
the subway photos were n't shown publicly until the 1960s , and , as i flipped through the pages , i had the fanciful notion of someone at the exhibit 's opening recognizing the same person in two of the portraits			0
when i set out to write a novel in 2006 , i returned to this old idea -- which necessarily took me back to @entity18 in the late ' 30s			1
beyond that , i 've always had a great interest in the period between 1900 and 1940 , because it was a period of such incredible creative combustion			0
in retrospect , the pace of change in the arts and industry in the 19th century seems pretty glacial			0
painting , music , the novel , architecture were all evolving , but at a pretty observable pace			0
then in the span of a few decades , you have @entity181 , @entity182 , cubism , surrealism , jazz , @entity186 , @entity187 , the rise of socialism , movies , airplanes , skyscrapers and the general upending of received forms in almost every area of human endeavor			0
@entity18 was certainly one of the global centers in which these changes were taking shape , making it an inviting setting			1
@entity0 : your narrator , @entity35 , is such an appealing character with a very distinctive voice			0
was she modeled on anyone in your life ? @entity11 : none of the characters in the book is based on anyone in particular			1
but three of my grandparents and a great - grandmother lived into their late 90s or early 100s			1
my maternal grandparents lived across the street from me in the summers , and i 'd see them every day			0
over lunch when i was in my 20s , it was great fun to talk with them about their lives between the wars , when they were young adults			0
my grandmother , who was simultaneously a woman of manners and verve , fended off marriage proposals until she was 30 because she was having too much fun to settle down			0
like the book 's narrator , @entity35 , she pushed a rival in furs into the drink before ultimately accepting my grandfather 's proposal			2
@entity0 : while there 's a very retro appeal to the book , it still has a very modern feel			2
do you think your story could have taken place in today 's @entity18 ? @entity11 : i certainly hope so			1
i think the book 's themes of self - invention , aspiration , love and loss are as pertinent in today 's @entity18 as they were a century ago			1
certainly , the composition of @entity24 's social strata has changed in meaningful ways since the first half of the century			0
the @entity30 and the @entity255 were great leveling influences , in which many working - class individuals migrated from their ethnic communities towards a more homogenous middle class			2
at the same time , the aristocratic families of the 1920s began to abandon the outward pomp of cotillions and tails			2
@entity265 , @entity266 and @entity267 found their place in pantries high and low ( with consistency and low price being attained at the expense of differentiation and flavor )			0
this convergence has had weird byproducts : the vast of majority of @entity24 , spanning a wide array of economics ( from the statistically rich to the statistically poor ) , now identify themselves as " middle class			0
" and where in the first half of the century the struggling youth would have aspired to the narrow circles of aristocracy , in recent decades the affluent youth have aspired to the fashion and cadences of the streets			0
but having made these rough generalizations about transformation , i 'd say that many aspects of 1930s social behavior prevail			0
we clearly still live in an aspirational society			0
we have just exited half a decade when virtually every tier of the @entity24 population has borrowed money in order to buy bigger cars and bigger houses with better fixtures			0
and we still have @entity24 youth in pursuit of success and stature , though success and stature today may mean wearing sneakers at a startup rather than a tuxedo at a country club			0
one interesting aspect of @entity18 in particular is that it is a leading capital for advertising , art , broadcasting , fashion , finance , food , journalism , music , publishing , theater , etc. this means that every year , young people from all over the world with very different backgrounds , interests and ambitions descend on the city			1
they are all looking to establish connections ( in the @entity336 sense as well as the networking sense ) , which provides the city with a unique chemistry			0
this , too , is a @entity13 reality that has persisted for generations			1
@entity0 : " @entity9 " has received some high praise and been compared to classics like " @entity344 , " " breakfast at @entity346 " and " @entity347 , " among others			1
what do you think about these comparisons ? @entity11 : i understand why the book 's subject matter has prompted these comparisons , but i really did n't think too much about the great authors of the @entity18 scene while i was writing the book			1
at the onset , i had my premise from the @entity139 ' photos ( of an individual undergoing transformation in 1938 @entity18 ) and my narrator ( with her wry , ambitious intellect and sharp moral compass ) , and i tried to let all else spring essentially from those elements			2
i suppose i also claimed the period as my own through invention			0
perhaps i did n't struggle too much with comparison because i am such a lover of collage			0
whether it 's the works of the early dadaists or the boxes of @entity375 or sampling in contemporary music , i enjoy experiencing the successful integration of one work of art into another			0
i have hundreds of influences at this stage of my life , and i am constantly collaging them into my work while still hoping to fashion something new			0
