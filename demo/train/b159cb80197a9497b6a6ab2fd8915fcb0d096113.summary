-- it all sounds eerily familiar			0
then , an apparent glitch that , while it does n't affect everyone , is prevalent enough to irk customers and catch the eyes of tech journalists everywhere			0
poor battery life on the @entity12 , released on october 14 to great fanfare and record sales , has been the new model 's @entity15 in the minds of many users			1
while complaints about the perceived problem have n't reached the fevered pitch that last year 's @entity24 release saw about its so - called " death grip " problem , they do n't seem to be going away			1
there were , of course , the expected number of early - adopter quibbles with the phone : from troubles with new carrier @entity32 , to a sometimes slow - moving camera , to limits on the voice - activated siri " personal assistant " outside the @entity36			0
but as most of those gripes either got sorted or users got used to the limitations , complaints about the phone 's battery life have persisted			1
a post on the @entity46 support forums , begun on october 15 to discuss battery problems , was still active tuesday -- two weeks and 185 pages worth of comments later			1
" i purchased what i thought was a top - of - the - line product only to be terribly disappointed , " one user wrote tuesday			0
" this is my first @entity24 and may well be my last			2
" battery life was a frequent complaint about the @entity56 , but concerns about the phone 's short battery life seemed to have been addressed on the next - generation @entity24			1
according to @entity46 's official specs , the @entity12 should have enough juice in the battery for up to eight hours of talk time , six hours of internet surfing , 10 hours of video viewing and 200 hours on standby			1
( all activities on a @entity68 connection -- @entity69 and wireless have different figures )			0
all of those numbers are within an hour or so of the @entity24 , except for one			2
the older phone 's specifications promise 300 hours of standby power : a full 50 % more than the @entity12			1
users complaining on the @entity46 forum and elsewhere say that their phones are n't lasting anywhere near even that reduced length of time			2
various independent tests of the new phone have suggested that some phones have problems with poor battery life , while others do n't			1
the general consensus among tech - inclined owners is that the problem may not lie with the battery itself , but with the way the phone utilizes @entity46 's latest mobile operating system , @entity94			1
specifically , the theory goes , its location - based services are a power drain			2
if the phone is constantly trying to pinpoint where it is , it will suck power even when the user is n't actively doing something with the phone			0
( for a comparison , think about how quickly your battery drains when you forget to turn off @entity108 searches while you 're driving			0
) the new phone also has a more powerful processor -- the same one that 's in the @entity110			0
that could cut battery life , even though @entity46 ceo @entity113 specifically said that it would n't during the @entity12 unveiling event last month			1
apparently , reading from the well - worn @entity46 playbook , the company has not commented publicly about the battery complaints			1
messages and e-mails to @entity46 seeking comment on these complaints were not returned			2
it 's unclear whether the company acknowledges there 's a battery problem ( although there have been reports that @entity46 is contacting @entity12 users to try to get to the bottom of it )			1
and while it 's too early for direct comparisons , the extended silence looks remarkably like the public - relations two - step that was @entity46 's handling of the @entity24 's antenna issues			1
( as you may recall , @entity137 and others said the @entity24 had antenna problems that caused it to drop calls			2
people dubbed the situation " @entity144			0
" ) first , the company refused to publicly acknowledge the issue			0
then , there was a software patch apparently aimed at fixing it ( although @entity46 never explicitly said so )			2
there would eventually be a news conference in which then - ceo @entity152 spent most of the time denying there was any real problem , then announcing that the company would give away free bumpers -- minimalist @entity24 cases -- to prevent dropped calls			2
but before that , there were the private e-mails and public statements saying , in essence , that users were holding their phones wrong			0
then , weeks after the free - bumper news conference , @entity152 and others doubled back , saying that there was never really much of a problem and discontinuing the freebie program			0
as @entity46 's silence persists ( the company has said in the past that it spends time researching potential problems before addressing them publicly ) , users and observers are complaining and speculating in the vacuum			1
and that 's not always pretty			0
" it hits you when you least expect it			0
it slips away under a mask of dormant inactivity			0
and it can ruin your entire day , " @entity188 's @entity187 wrote tuesday			0
" it 's your @entity12 battery life , and it sucks			1

complaints about @entity12 battery life mount
some @entity24 owners say their batteries drain much faster than *advertised*
@entity46 has not publicly acknowledged the concerns
