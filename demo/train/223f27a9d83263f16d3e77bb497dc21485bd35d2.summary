-- it has been more than 65 years , but for 93 - year - old @entity6 , the image of a @entity4 torpedo bomber closing in on him will never go away			1
@entity6 still has vivid memories of the day his life flashed before his eyes			1
" our ship was starting to swing around , " @entity6 softly recalls			1
" all of a sudden , here comes a @entity14 torpedo bomber all aflame right at my eye level			1
i could have reached out and touched the wing			2
" @entity6 joined the @entity17 in 1942 and was immediately assigned to serve aboard the @entity18 in the @entity19			1
he hoped enlisting in the @entity17 would prevent his younger brother from being drafted			1
" let him stay home to help the family , " @entity6 recalls			1
" that 's why i joined the @entity17 , i was 25 years old			1
but finally near the end , they drafted him			2
he was wounded in @entity28 but made it home ok			2
" @entity6 was a machinist in the @entity17 during @entity30 although he had experienced many terrifying moments during his four years in the service , nothing compared to that october night during the @entity34 in 1944			1
up until now , the @entity30 veteran has shared the experience of that frightening night with only one other person , his son			1
" plainly , i saw the pilot and the gunner in there , " @entity6 explains as his voice gets louder			1
" the plane was afire			2
good thing we were swinging			2
it just missed us and went along and crashed in the ocean and exploded			0
" two other cruisers , the @entity48 and the @entity49 , had already been aerial torpedoed the previous two nights			0
" i know one thing , i was really scared there , " @entity6 recalls , slowly shaking his head as his eyes grow wider			1
" i could n't do anything			0
" @entity56 and @entity57 team up to honor veterans the four years that @entity6 served were extremely stressful , he says			1
the heavy cruiser would be at sea for months at a time before finally pulling into port for supplies			0
when out at sea , there was always a concern , especially during war time			2
" we never knew how close we came to being torpedoed , " @entity6 says			1
" the engine room was down below the water			0
you get hit with a torpedo and you 're done			2
" @entity6 realized he needed something to help cope with the dangers of war			1
he decided to turn to a sport he had been playing since age 10			0
" we 'd get a few hours off on the beach , " @entity6 says			1
" we had equipment , softballs , bats , different things			0
a bunch of guys would get together and we 'd start a little game			0
it was just for fun			0
you got a little relaxed			0
" playing ball helped him during the unnerving days of @entity30 and it has helped him ever since			1
@entity6 hopes to continue playing ball for at least a couple more years			2
" i enjoy playing ball			0
it makes me feel good			0
seeing my age , i can still run around			0
" he says , smiling			0
" i ca n't play like i used to , but i get a hit once in a while			0
" " @entity99 was something that you could keep playing			0
just my luck , i came down here ( @entity104 , @entity105 ) and they had a team and i 've been playing ever since			0
it 's been great ! otherwise , i 'd be sitting at home in a rocking chair ! "			0
