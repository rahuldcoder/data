the final will be held in @entity14 on july 1			2
amid the excitement , critics have questioned whether the stadiums and infrastructure will be delivered on time for the visit of thousands of fans to @entity34			0
@entity35 : @entity3 build up ' a complicated adventure ' here , @entity0 examines the myriad of issues on the field , and off it			2
what is the @entity42 ? the competition was born in 1960 and is held every four years			0
it sees @entity34 's top soccer nations battle it out to be crowned the continent 's best team			1
there is a two - year - long qualification period , at the end of which 16 teams make the finals			2
they are then drawn into four groups of four , with the top two teams progressing from the group to the quarterfinal stage			0
the last installment , hosted by @entity59 and @entity60 in 2008 , saw @entity61 beat @entity62 1 - 0 in the final			0
which venues will stage the games ? there are four stadiums in each country that will host games			0

in @entity13 , @entity14 's @entity79 has the honor of the final , while the @entity82 in @entity83 , the @entity84 in @entity85 and the brand new @entity86 will also stage games			1
what are the fears surrounding the tournament ? @entity3 was awarded to @entity24 and @entity13 by @entity94 football 's governing body @entity92 in 2007 -- the first time @entity34 has been called upon to host a major football tournament			1
but their preparations have been criticized for the delayed building of stadiums and infrastructure projects necessary to support the thousands of fans that will descend on both countries come june			0
as early as 2008 , @entity92 president @entity35 was speaking of the need to resolve problems with the project , saying of @entity13 he had to " wake them up a little " and tell them to " get going			1
" despite rumors that @entity111 offered to step in should the tournament be taken away from @entity13 , @entity35 said it would remain with the its original hosts			2
there are still issues to resolve around the stadium in @entity86 , with @entity24 authorities facing similar concerns over their brand new @entity74 in @entity75			2
@entity13 deputy prime minister @entity121 told @entity123 's @entity122 this week that at no stage did he think the tournament would be stripped from his country : " neither the president nor the government feared they 'd lose the right to host the championship			1
of course we were a little bit scared to physically not be on schedule			0
our sleepless nights , there have been too many to say , but construction has kept going 24/7 during the last 15 months			0
" but @entity139 's @entity138 told @entity0 that @entity13 's focus on getting the stadiums ready has come at the expense of the infrastructure needed to stage the event			1
" the concern is that externally , outside of the stadiums , the transport infrastructure has n't been brought up to speed , there are n't enough hotels			0
" so there will be trouble for fans getting around the tournament			0
as far as @entity92 are concerned , in terms of putting on a television spectacle for the world , @entity13 has done a very good job in getting the stadiums ready			1
" what has @entity0 discovered in @entity13 ? on a whistle - stop tour of the four cities and stadiums that will host matches in @entity13 , @entity122 said he had been impressed with the football arenas but found that some building projects were still battling to be ready , such as the one at @entity166 , where construction on a new terminal and a lengthened runway continues 24 hours a day			1
he said : " having spent the last week traveling across both countries i can tell you that if you are a football supporter , you need n't worry			0
the stadiums look great and although some of the roads and railways may not be completed by the start of the tournament , enough progress will have been made to make the fan experience a good one			0
" what are the costs involved ? according to @entity92 figures , revenues taken during the 2008 tournament were $ 1.7 billion , with an estimated television audience of 4.8 billion for the 31 matches			2
the final was broadcast to 231 countries around the world			0
speculation in @entity13 , from the @entity190 , claims the country 's total cost of staging @entity3 is $ 14.5 billion , paid for by a combination of private and public money			1
the paper claims @entity24 's estimated costs are in the region of $ 30 billion			1
@entity199 , communications director for @entity200 -- the national coordinating company for @entity3 in @entity24 -- told @entity0 : " the investment , thanks to @entity3 , has accelerated infrastructure development in this country by three to five years			1
the overall cost has been $ 27 billion and has made @entity24 the largest construction site in @entity34			2
" @entity208 , head of the press office for the vice-prime minister of @entity13 , told @entity0 : " the @entity13 has invested $ 750 million in sport infrastructure to host @entity3 , not including the cost of the airport and transportation infrastructure			1
but being host has really acted as a catalyst for this development to take place			0
" all four airports in @entity13 's host cities are being revamped , while a series of new hotel developments have also been built -- 67 in @entity83 alone			1
a high - speed rail link will be in operation to ferry fans between host cities , and new road networks have also been built .			0
