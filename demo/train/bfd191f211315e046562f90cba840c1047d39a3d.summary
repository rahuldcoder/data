-- last month , the @entity2 city of @entity3 joined the likes of @entity5 and @entity6 to become the latest @entity7			1
most people could probably name a @entity10 or @entity11 author , but how about a @entity2 one ? readers who are not @entity2 or of @entity2 descent face a few obstacles to opening the rich and different world of @entity2 literature			1
firstly , @entity2 is not a world player , and we tend to become interested in a country 's culture only when it is a global power or a real or possible threat to us			2
secondly there is the spelling and pronouncing of names			0
we can handle the @entity28 transliteration of @entity29 as @entity30			0
but the @entity2 for @entity29 , alas , is @entity31			2
( i played @entity34 with a friend in @entity36 : a player gets one point for a @entity39 ) obstacle three is that the jewel in the crown of @entity2 literature is its poetry , and unfortunately poetry is what usually gets lost in translation ( though the translations have been improving )			1
however it 's worth facing and overcoming these obstacles , because the @entity2 way of looking at the world has plenty to teach us			1
if @entity2 literature began in the @entity56 it blossomed in mid- 19th century @entity57			1
the @entity58 was the poet @entity59			0
his " @entity69 , " a novel in verse , restores a lost world through the magic of art. there is dalliance , swordplay , music , a hunt -- but even a humble vegetable patch delights			0
fast forward to the 20th century and @entity2 poetry and drama took a turn towards the avant - garde			2
the poetry had been remarkable from the beginning , but @entity78 , a contemporary of @entity80 ( his verse is strikingly similar to her quiet , difficult lyricism ) , showed the way to modern understatement			0
check out @entity85 and @entity2 's @entity87 laureate @entity86			1
@entity88 and dark humor are @entity2 specialties and appear in the playful stories and novels of @entity93			1
lovers of science fiction should know @entity96			1
a @entity3 native , @entity96 became internationally known for " @entity98 , " ( which gave rise to two films , one by @entity101 and a @entity103 version by @entity104 ) , satirical fantasy " @entity109 , " and essays on humanity and future technology			1
his work is marked by fun , pain , and a probing intelligence			0
read more : @entity2 's tangible heritage all these poets , playwrights , novelists , and essayists write about the human condition , but there has always been a political element to most @entity2 literature ; a consequence of growing up in a country with a history of partition and repeated defeat			1
@entity2 was a major @entity130 power during the 17th and 18th centuries			2
however weak kings and lack of organization led to a political vacuum and the country ceased to exist without a fight in 1795 when @entity138 , @entity139 , and @entity28 divided it up among themselves			0
@entity2 did not exist again as a state until after @entity142 during that long period of nationlessness , poets and novelists strove to preserve @entity2 identity at home and abroad			2
soldiers fought in other lands , hoping to make a future @entity2 possible ; and young men periodically sacrificed themselves in uprisings that were crushed ( 1830 , 1848 , 1863 )			2
@entity2 became known for their idealism , their valor in the face of overwhelming odds , their splendid if suicidal recklessness , their patriotism , and -- understandably , given that over and over again this patriotism proved futile -- for their cynicism			0
the 20th century added another shadow to the @entity2 mind : the @entity162 ; before @entity163 , @entity2 had the largest jewish community in @entity130			0
@entity2 fought with the @entity165 but " in reward " ( a @entity2 smile of irony here ) had to spend the next fifty years behind the @entity170			1
irony is not unique to @entity2 writers but they are masters of it			1
it 's telling that an @entity177 writer much loved in @entity2 today is @entity178 , who felt that the world was against him			2
i offer an emblematic moment in @entity2 literature			1
a much loved author to @entity2 is @entity184			2
in " @entity190 , " a historical novel set in the mid- 17th century , the soldier @entity186 reminds us of @entity189			0
he has taken a vow of chastity and he may not pursue the object of his affections until he has cut off three enemy heads with a single blow of his enormous @entity199 's sword			0
he manages that but then , without hesitation , offers himself up to martyrdom			0
the mix of humor , bitterness , and religious faith : very @entity2			1
@entity206 received his phd in @entity208 at @entity209			0
he works as an editor for the @entity211			0
for @entity212 he recently translated , from @entity2 , " @entity213 , " by @entity214 .			0

get over the tricky spelling and @entity2 literature has plenty to offer , says editor and author @entity206
@entity2 science fiction writer @entity96 *inspired* many , with his ' @entity98 ' twice made into a film
@entity86 was *awarded* the @entity222 in 1996
irony , dark humor and faith are all common themes in @entity2 literature
