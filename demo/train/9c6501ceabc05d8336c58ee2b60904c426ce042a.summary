-- @entity1 was overthrown as president of @entity3 in a @entity5 - backed coup in 1954 , a seminal event that historians say set the @entity9 country on a path of dictatorships and civil war that would last for decades			1
even though he was democratically elected and popular at the time , after @entity1 was deposed , his reputation was ruined and he was written out of @entity3 's history books			1
he died in exile in 1971			0
this week , 57 years later , current president @entity16 made a public apology to the @entity1 family , a large gesture in @entity3			1
there is also a larger rehabilitation of the image of @entity1 under way			2
textbooks are being rewritten and a new biography will soon be published			0
but this clearing of @entity1 's reputation does not console everyone			2
some ask : when will the @entity30 , which was behind the coup , apologize for its meddling ? " as president of the republic , as commander in chief of the army , i want to apologize to the @entity1 family for that great crime committed on the 27th of june of 1954 , " @entity16 said thursday			1
" @entity3 changed that day , and we have n't yet recovered			2
" the apology " does n't have a lot of resonance in the @entity30 -- though it should , " said @entity40 , an @entity41 at the @entity42 and co-author of a book on the 1954 coup			1
the @entity30 , after all , was the power behind the event			2
in a nutshell , there were two main arguments about what led the @entity30 to see @entity1 as a threat , one economic and one political			1
at the time , the largest landowner in @entity3 was an @entity30 firm , the @entity56			1
@entity1 , in an effort to reduce income inequality in the country , instituted a land reform program that would have taken unused @entity56 land and turned it over to farmers			2
" we 're talking huge amounts of land , " @entity40 said , enough to grow the middle class			0
another author of a book on the subject , @entity67 professor @entity66 , said that 100,000 families -- representing about half a million @entity3 -- benefited from the reform			0
@entity1 's goal was to double that number by the end of his term , he said			0
but @entity56 went to president @entity77 and labeled @entity1 as a communist and a threat to democracy			1
this political argument gained traction , and the @entity5 became involved			0
according to @entity40 , the @entity5 found a group of disgruntled @entity3 right - wingers opposed to @entity1 who set up an elaborate ploy to oust him			1
the @entity5 helped set up secret radio broadcasts along the perimeter of @entity3			0
they used fake broadcasts to warn of an impending massive revolt , and backed it up with planes that dropped bombs ( many of them fake ) in @entity3 , @entity40 said			1
the fake broadcasts and bombings " put such fear in the small country " that it just collapsed , he said			0
the @entity3 army went along with it because the @entity30 convinced commanders there would be an invasion otherwise , @entity66 said			1
they were " terrorized into betraying " @entity1 , he said			0
given the deep @entity30 involvement , @entity66 said this of @entity107 's apology to the @entity1 family : " it 's not very clear what he 's apologizing for			1
" " what he should do , if he has the guts , is to ask the @entity30 to apologize for their crime , " he said			1
the son of the ousted president , @entity1 , said such an effort was already under way			1
signatures are being collected for a petition to the @entity30 government to apologize for its role , he said			2
the @entity124 said that its embassy in @entity3 was preparing a statement regarding @entity1 , but as of saturday it had not been released			1
for the younger @entity1 , the apology from the @entity3 government is a great first step			1
" we are happy with this , " he said			0
" justice has been done			0
" the @entity1 family had gone before the @entity133 in 1999 to demand the apology from the government			2
earlier this year , the commission negotiated a number of actions that the government promised to undertake			0
in addition to the public apology , the government is making economic reparations to the family and is naming a highway after @entity1			2
school curricula are also being revamped to give @entity1 a more prominent role in @entity3 's history			1
even some @entity3 @entity0 spoke with brushed off the significance of the apology , saying the coup was so long ago that it is irrelevant			2
but according to @entity40 , the ramifications of the coup were far - reaching			0
instead of 30 years of bloody civil war , @entity3 might have remained a democracy and influenced neighboring countries to do the same , sparing thousands of lives			0
@entity66 says that his sources confirm that @entity1 in actuality was a communist , but had no aspirations to form a dictatorship			0
his only goal was to address the nation 's serious inequality , something that the land reform could have accomplished , he said			0
but with a strong military , whether there would have been democracy even without the coup is an open question , he said			0
@entity16 's apology seems , at the very least , able to reignite the debate over @entity1 's legacy and the problems that @entity3 faces , many which have been consistent since 1954			1
