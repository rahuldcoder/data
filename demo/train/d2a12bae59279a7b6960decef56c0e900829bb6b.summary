@entity0 -- before he died last year , @entity2 was viewed as a kind of @entity4 equivalent to @entity6 tv icon @entity5 , gaining fame by bringing music to generations of teens			1
@entity2 was knighted by @entity11 he now stands accused as a predatory sex offender			1
the shocking allegations have @entity4 reeling			0
countless viewers who grew up watching @entity15 on tv 's " @entity16 " and his children 's program " @entity21 " are now questioning their trust in a social institution : the @entity24			1
it 's the worst crisis at the @entity24 in 50 years , says a top correspondent , and the scandal has prompted a wider examination into an alleged culture of sexism stretching back decades within @entity4 's widely respected public broadcaster			1
the scandal has also gripped the @entity4 media , with many questioning who knew what and when about the alleged abuse of mostly teenage girls and whether there was any attempt at a coverup			2
police say they have identified more than 200 potential victims , with accusations spanning several decades , and are investigating other suspects in connection with alleged abuse			1
@entity2 died in october 2011 at age 84 , soon after being treated in a hospital for pneumonia			2

@entity58 , said was " alleged abuse on an unprecedented scale			0
" the @entity24 , on whose premises some of the sexual assaults occurred , has found itself in the dock of public opinion seeking to explain how his behavior went undetected for decades			2
the national public broadcaster has set up two independent inquiries , and director general @entity69 was called before a panel of lawmakers tuesday to defend its handling of the scandal -- including why the broadcaster decided to drop an investigation into the star last year			1
" there is no question that what @entity2 did and the way the @entity24 behaved in the years -- the culture and practices of the @entity24 seems to allow @entity2 to do what he did -- will raise questions of trust for us and reputation for us , " @entity69 said			1
" this is a gravely serious matter , and one can not look back at it with anything other than horror , frankly , that his activities went on as long as they did undetected			0
" @entity69 pointed out that the @entity24 was not alone in failing to uncover @entity2 's behavior , with no newspaper @entity95 © published in his lifetime			1
and he drew a parallel with a furor that has recently gripped the @entity6 , where retired @entity100 football coach @entity99 was convicted of molesting numerous children			2
" mr. @entity2 has prosecuted his activities , his disgusting activities , in a matter that was very successfully and skilfully concealed , and experts in pedophile behavior have pointed out that 's often the case , " @entity69 said			1
" in the case of the @entity6 , of @entity99 ... these people build very long - range plans to put them in contact with their targets			1
these things are institutionally , it seems , very difficult to deal with			0
" related : national treasure in life , reviled ' sex abuser ' in death @entity2 had access to psychiatric hospital the @entity120 also faces difficult questions over the access @entity2 was allowed to a number of hospitals			1
among them was @entity126 , a high - security psychiatric hospital where @entity2 worked as a volunteer and had keys to the wards			2
in 1988 , he was appointed to a senior role there , a move now being investigated by the @entity120			0
the police may also be asked to explain why past abuse claims against @entity15 never led to investigations resulting in a prosecution in his lifetime			1
how celebrity scandal has rocked the @entity24 reasons behind the national outrage over the scandal include @entity15 's privileged position as a broadcaster			1
at a time when viewers had only a handful of channels to choose from , @entity2 was a @entity24 mainstay			1
@entity2 's program aimed at children , " @entity151 'll fix it , " ran for almost 20 years , airing in the prime saturday teatime slot			1
children wrote in with dreams they wanted the star to make come true -- and at the height of its popularity , the @entity24 said it was receiving 20,000 requests a week			2
the show 's theme surrounded famous " fixes " that included an encounter between boxing legend @entity164 and a group of @entity166 who also wanted to eat their packed lunches on a roller coaster , resulting in a predictable mess			2
stories of abuse victims , male and female , have come forward with harrowing tales of sexual abuse			0
they also explain how the star 's power and fame made it hard for them to speak out			0
@entity183 , who appeared on " @entity151 'll fix it " as a @entity185 at the age of 9 , told of how he was invited into @entity15 's @entity24 dressing room after the show			1
@entity2 proceeded to undo his shorts and touch him inappropriately -- only stopping when someone else suddenly entered the room and , as abruptly , left			0
" he said to me , ' do n't you dare tell anyone about this because no one will believe it , because i 'm @entity197 , ' " @entity183 said			0
the boy could hardly bear to watch the show when it aired a few months later , to the great excitement of his family			0
" i just hated the man , " @entity183 said			0
" i blamed myself for 37 years			0
that 's the worst thing : you do blame yourself			0
" @entity205 , deputy leader of the opposition @entity206 , sympathized with the plight of the victims			0
" everyone has been sickened by the vile abuse perpetrated by @entity2 , and it is impossible to overstate the suffering caused to those he abused , " she said last week			1
scandal rocks the @entity24 veteran @entity24 world affairs correspondent @entity216 gave an idea of the sense of disarray within the company during an interview broadcast monday			1
" this is the worst crisis that i can remember in my nearly 50 years at the @entity24			1
... i do n't think the @entity24 has handled it terribly well			0
all we have as an organization is the trust of people , the people that watch us and listen to us			0
... if we start to lose that , that 's very dangerous for the @entity24			1
" the @entity24 , which has repeatedly expressed its horror over the abuse , is now embroiled in painful internal turmoil , with the two independent inquiries raking over e-mails and conversations for evidence of who knew what when			2
one is focused on the culture and practices of the @entity24 , as well as the safeguards in place for members of the public and staff now and in the past , while the other is scrutinizing why its flagship current affairs program " @entity249 " dropped its investigation into @entity251 late last year			0
on monday , the @entity24 said the program 's editor , @entity252 , was " stepping aside " amid the furor			2
it labeled an october 2 blog post by @entity252 explaining his decision to drop the investigation " inaccurate or incomplete in some respects			0
" hours later , another @entity24 program , " @entity260 , " broadcast its own probe into the " @entity249 " decision , suggesting that serious allegations had been made to " @entity249 " reporters before the investigation was shelved			0
on tuesday , @entity69 told lawmakers that having watched the program , he was " surprised that nothing further happened " in light of the material dug up by " @entity249			0
" meanwhile , the scandal continues to dominate conversation in homes , workplaces and pubs across the country as people seek to understand how a man widely seen as an eccentric hero could have duped the nation and done so much harm			0
the debate is all the more uncomfortable as @entity2 appears to have used his access to children , through his charity and tv work , as a means to prey on vulnerable young people for decades -- and has gone to his grave unpunished			2
@entity1 's @entity290 , @entity291 and @entity292 contributed to this report .			0
