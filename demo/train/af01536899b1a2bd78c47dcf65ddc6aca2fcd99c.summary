-- federal support for renewable power helped the @entity5 reclaim from @entity6 the title of the world 's biggest investor in clean energy , researchers for the nonprofit @entity2 reported wednesday			1
the $ 48 billion in @entity5 private investment in technology such as wind turbines and solar panels in 2011 edged out @entity6 's $ 45.5 billion , @entity2 researchers found in a new study			1
worldwide , investors put $ 263 billion into renewable energy projects last year -- a 6.5 % increase over 2010 -- and the cost of producing electricity from solar power was cut in half , the study found			2
but the @entity5 gains have been boosted by government incentives , including provisions of the 2009 economic stimulus package , that are due to disappear within two years , said @entity28 , director of @entity2 's clean energy programs			1
" those countries that have long - term policies in place are the ones that have had consistent growth , " @entity30 told @entity0			1
" and we do n't have that			0
" and while @entity5 investors have been ponying up while the incentives are in place , much of that money is going into projects overseas -- and @entity5 is importing the resulting products			1
" the @entity5 is , frankly , missing an opportunity if we do not manufacture and export to these counties with growing middle classes who are going to be purchasing these products , " @entity30 said			1
solar , wind , biomass and small - scale hydroelectric projects installed worldwide had the capability to produce about 565 billion watts , or 565 gigawatts , of electricity in 2011 , the report found			2
that 's about 10 percent of the worldwide total , and roughly enough to reduce carbon emissions most scientists blame for a warming climate by between 3 % to 6 % , according to analysts at the @entity62 , a @entity63 - based think tank that concentrates on energy and the environment			0
in the @entity5 , renewables other than hydroelectric provide about 4.7 % of @entity5 generating capacity , according to figures from the @entity69			1
@entity71 saw the third - largest investment in alternative energy with nearly $ 31 billion in 2011 , even though that figure was down 5 % from 2010 , the @entity2 report found			1
the @entity71 added more than 7 gigawatts of solar energy capacity in 2011 , while @entity77 investments grew by nearly 40 % to $ 28 billion			0
@entity77 added about 8 gigawatts of solar energy , mostly in small - scale projects			0
and @entity80 saw a 54 percent increase in support for clean energy			0
@entity80 projects grew to $ 10.2 billion , adding 2.8 gigawatts in wind power			0
@entity71 and @entity6 have boosted their green energy sector " through consistent policies , " by setting targets for new generating capacity , the report said			1
" what that tells investors is , ' go there -- they 're in it for the long term , ' " @entity30 said			1
" they 're not going to let that expire in 2013			0
" meanwhile , no new @entity5 wind projects have been commissioned for 2014 , she said			2
the @entity5 is also seeing a boom in cheap natural gas , which produces fewer carbon emissions than coal or oil			2
and in the past year , the collapse of the solar energy firm @entity109 has cast a pall over alternative energy funding in the @entity5			2
@entity109 filed for bankruptcy in 2011 after receiving more than $ 535 million in federal loan guarantees , putting more than 1,000 people out of work			0
president @entity118 's @entity117 opposition has attacked the loan - guarantee program as " crony capitalism , " accusing @entity109 of receiving special treatment because a key investor was an @entity118 fundraiser , but supporters say the company was undermined by the explosive growth of @entity6 's solar industry			0
@entity30 said companies are going to fail as the renewable power industry grows , comparing it to the early years of the automobile industry			2
" there were over 100 companies trying to make cars at the turn of the century , " she said			0
" and now we basically have three			0

government incentives boost @entity5 investment in green power , @entity2 says
but many of those incentives will expire in the next two years
countries that have long - term policies draw more investment
