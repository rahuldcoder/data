-- i thought i was prepared for @entity2			1
after all , i 'd spent more than half my life studying , traveling to and living in the @entity4 as well as other communist and @entity7 countries			2
commuters head to work in downtown @entity9 this past february			2
so , as we arrived at @entity9 airport , i felt oddly at home			2
the same empty airport as in @entity14 in 1969			2
( in the @entity2 capital we later found out our flight was the only one scheduled for arrival that day			1
) staring down at our plane as we taxied to the terminal , a huge color portrait of @entity21 , @entity2 's " great leader			1
" no matter where we went over the next nine days , the gaze of @entity21 , or his son , @entity23 , the current ruler known as the " @entity23 , " would follow us , from portraits hung on buildings , monuments , bridges ... to lapel pins on the chests of almost everyone we met , including the two men who greeted us , mr. @entity34 and mr. @entity35 , who would be our guides , minders and controllers for the duration of our stay			2
in 1969 , arriving in @entity42 as a student , it seemed that every street i traveled was decorated with the image of @entity47 , father of the @entity42 revolution			2
adults wore lapel pins with images of the @entity54 leader , children wore little " @entity56 " pins			2
" @entity47 lived , @entity47 lives , @entity47 will live			2
" i was told , and so does @entity21 , who died in 1994			2
even in death , the communist leaders have something in common : their bodies are embalmed and lie in glass - covered coffins , on display in mausoleums in @entity66 and @entity9			1
@entity42 experts reportedly helped the @entity2 with the cosmetic aspects of political immortality			1
the streets of the @entity2 capital reminded me of @entity66 in the 1960s			1
almost no traffic , just official cars whizzing down empty boulevards , curtains pulled shut to protect elite @entity77 members from the prying eyes of pedestrians			2
in @entity66 they used to drive long black @entity81 or @entity82			2
in @entity9 , it 's mostly older @entity84 , often an incongruous baby blue			1
in any country , one of the best ways to see how people live is to visit the food stores and markets			1
for several days we pestered our @entity2 guides to take us to markets where the first tiny buds of capitalism are sprouting , the government allowing people to sell fruits and vegetables -- one way of relieving the food shortage in the @entity2			1
in search of state - owned food stores , i went for a walk one evening in town , without a guide			1
the stores were closed , it was a holiday , but as i peered through the darkened window of one shop i went back in time to the stores i saw in @entity42 a quarter century ago			2
a few tin cans of fish stacked neatly in pyramids , a half - bare counter displaying a few lonely onions and cucumbers			1
this was in the capital , much better provisioned than the countryside , where @entity2 often go hungry			1
choreographed encounters in @entity42 , our guides went to extraordinary lengths to control what we saw and limit our interaction with average people			1
mr. @entity34 and mr. @entity35 must have studied at the same guide school			2
their mentality was the same : make sure we saw nothing that could reflect negatively on the government or @entity77 leadership			0
one morning , as we were driven out of @entity9 to a mountain resort ensuring we would be kept far from any interaction with ordinary people , we asked our guides to let us stop by the road and shoot some pictures of the countryside			0
suddenly , the young one , 29 - year - old mr. @entity34 , sporting a sleek black pompadour and a smirk , told us to stop			1
" there is an old woman down there , " he explained			0
presumably , her bent back was not what he wanted on tape			0
our older guide , mr. @entity35 , a former diplomat , was more flexible			0
he cracked a smile when i told him of how my @entity155 escorts back in the 1970s took us on a boat ride down the @entity157 , refusing our pleas to stop along the way			0
at one deserted spot we were allowed to pull into shore for a picnic lunch			0
several of us set off on foot to see what we could find			0
in a tiny village , we came upon a lovely young woman wearing makeup			0
when we complimented her on how nice she looked , she said : " they told us you were coming			0
" knowing that virtually every encounter is choreographed in advance creates a strange mind - warp			1
in @entity9 we asked to see some of the everyday life in @entity2 and our guides finally took us to the city park , a magnificently beautiful expanse of hills and trees			1
hearing drumming in the distance , i walked swiftly to see where it was coming from			0
a few minutes away i spotted an open - air pavilion filled with older @entity2 , most of them women in traditional flowing dress , cinched at the bust with a sash			1
they were singing , dancing and laughing uproariously , some of them beating out a rhythm on small red - painted drums shaped like an hourglass			1
they simply smiled and kept dancing			0
mr. @entity35 caught up and we both surveyed the scene , utterly charming in its simplicity and gaiety			0
he turned to me with a smile and said , " they knew you were coming			0
" was he pulling my leg ? was he telling the truth ? i guess i 'll never know but i prefer to think that at least this encounter with @entity2 was not scripted			1
the @entity2 may have a hard - edged image in the world of fierce militarism and , just as in the old @entity4 , much of life is run like the army , with group -- not individual -- activities the norm			1
yet , in spite of that hard - edged atmosphere , there is an incongruous feeling of primness , as well			1
in @entity9 , 20 - something traffic girls direct the non-existent traffic , robot - like in their white uniforms , black hair pulled back in identical @entity227 - style chignons			1
they remind me of little @entity42 girls in their starched school uniforms , organdy bows in their hair			0
women in @entity66 dressed neatly , but modestly , with no access to imported clothes			0
it 's much the same here in @entity9 yet there is one sign of changing times in today 's @entity2 : a flash , here and there , of modest jewelry , unthinkable just a short time ago			1
following the @entity21 how to understand what people really think and feel ? it 's a question i asked myself so many times in @entity42 and it hounds me here in @entity2			1
there was no way for our @entity0 crew to blend in , with our @entity255 clothes , @entity255 looks and our mandatory silk arm bands , given to us by our @entity259 minders , navy blue with white lettering identifying us as journalists			1
in @entity42 , beneath the surface of repressive political control , if you looked hard enough , and spoke the language , you could sometimes find those lonely dissidents living in " internal migration " rejecting the pressure to conform			0
in @entity2 , conformity is taken to a degree i never imagined possible			1
at the " @entity275 , " the mass gymnastics show celebrating the 60th anniversary of the end of @entity279 occupation of @entity2 , thousands of performers dressed in military uniforms re-enact the battles and suffering that gave birth to their country			1
before the show , a murmuring in the audience builds to a buzz			0
the personal photographers of @entity23 suddenly appear close to the seat of honor			0
as the short , rotund leader enters the stadium , the audience leap to their feet , clapping rapturously as " @entity23 " applauds them back			0
do they believe in @entity21 ? believe in his " juche " philosophy of extreme self - reliance ? unable to speak @entity2 , cut off from unscripted meetings with @entity2 , i have no answer			1
@entity303 mr. @entity34 tries to explain it to me : @entity2 , he says , is like a rabbit			1
" its face is toward @entity307			0
its back is toward the @entity309			0
its ass is toward @entity279			0
its mouth is toward @entity42			0
" @entity2 , he tells me , needs no one			1
its unity is its weapon			0
surrounded by enemies , it must look to itself to survive			0
in the mountains a two - hour drive from @entity9 , there is a massive museum cut into the mountainside , built to house all the gifts given by international leaders to @entity21 and his son , @entity23			1
i ask what is the first gift @entity21 was given ? the guide , an elegant woman in traditional dress , sweeps though the cold marble corridors , leading us to a room where a full - size train car stands , its elaborate wood interior and brass lamps buffed and polished , a gift from @entity155 ruler @entity338			2
down one more corridor to a final room on our tour , the diminutive guide tugs at the door and i gasp			0
a life - size figure of the @entity21 , dressed in a suit , standing amid trees near a lake , mountains in the distance			2
even the leaves on the trees rustle as a breeze ( from a hidden fan ? ) blows by			0
the music is solemn , stately			0
mr. @entity34 and mr. @entity35 stand reverently and bow			0
the great leader stares blindly into the distance			0
does he know where his country is headed ?			0
