@entity0 , @entity1 -- a secret audio recording of their biggest election year target -- sen. @entity6 -- talking to a donor summit arranged by the @entity9 brothers , the @entity11 ' 2014 bogeymen			1
@entity11 pushed " @entity13 " story around online with frenetic glee			2
@entity16 's @entity11 challenger for his @entity1 seat , @entity18 , could n't wait to whack him on it , telling @entity2 in an exclusive interview that " @entity6 got caught in his 47 % @entity23 moment			1
" " i think it shows the extent and the lengths he will go to to pander to his party millionaires and billionaires at the expense of hurting @entity30 , " @entity18 told @entity2			2
the problem with the @entity11 ' argument is that @entity23 's 47 % moment was only a moment because he was saying to donors in private something he would never have dared to utter in public : " forty - seven percent who are with him , who are dependent upon government , who believe that they are victims , who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them , who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing , to you name it			1
that that 's an entitlement , " @entity23 said behind closed doors about president @entity53 's supporters in 2012			2
but unlike @entity23 , what @entity16 said to the @entity9 brothers are things he has said in public , and more importantly , his comments mirror positions he has publicly backed with actual @entity62 votes : opposition to @entity11 ' plans to increase the minimum wage , extend unemployment insurance and make student loans more affordable through the tax system			1
if @entity70 are in charge , he said , those wo n't be coming back to the @entity62 floor			2
" we 're not going to be debating all these gosh - darn proposals , " @entity16 told the @entity9 brothers and the rest of the room full of billionaire donors			1
@entity16 also talked about plans , if he becomes @entity62 majority leader , to attach policy riders to spending bills that would defund regulations president @entity53 has put in place that @entity70 loathe			2
" i did n't say anything in the private meeting i have n't said publicly , " @entity16 told @entity2 in another exclusive interview , saying he stands by his comments			1
when i put that reality to @entity18 , she did n't back down on her attack			0
in fact she doubled down			0
" i think this recording is alarming			0
he has promised further gridlock if elected but this is action he will directly take at the expense of @entity30 , " @entity18 said			0
a little context is in order for why @entity11 are jumping on this like a fatal @entity102 surprise : first , it 's all about the @entity9 brothers			1
@entity11 believe , based on internal polling , that voters think the system is rigged against them and that 's why they 're struggling			0
the @entity11 strategy in all the key races for control of the @entity62 is for the billionaire @entity9 brothers to become the poster boys for the rigged system -- that they pour tens of millions into the system to help @entity70 , so @entity70 help keep them rich			1
given that , having a muffled audio recording of the @entity118 leader addressing those fat cats , whether he is saying anything new or not , is in fact politically beneficial to @entity11			1
it helps perpetuate the narrative they believe has legs			0
the fact that @entity16 vowed no more debate on @entity11 " gosh - darn proposals " also gives @entity18 an opening on another key argument against @entity16 : that he is the personification of gridlock in @entity132			0
elect him , and it will only get worse			0
the downside for @entity11 is that they 're not exactly clean when it comes to taking billionaire cash			0
they , too , have high - rolling donors pouring unlimited dollars into the system on behalf of @entity11			1
but make no mistake about it : this secret audio recording will be front and center in @entity18 ' campaign and others for the near future			0
whether it will foment @entity152 fever here will depend in large part on how much is really already lying beneath the surface in this neck - and - neck race .			0
