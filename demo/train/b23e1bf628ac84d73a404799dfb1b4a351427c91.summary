-- the alarm in my phone fires into life at 6.30 a.m. and jolts me from my sleep			1
the year is 2014 and i 'm recovering from jet lag after flying back to @entity7 from @entity8 , and the time difference has got to me -- again			1
it 's worse than usual because i did n't sleep on the plane			1
too much work to do and as all transatlantic flights now have @entity14 , the urge to get stuff finished was overwhelming			1
it should be a quiet day back in the office			1
i say office of course , but since we all successfully worked from home during the @entity23 , bosses now understand that people can be just as productive working from home or on the go			1
that 's helped by blanket internet coverage and better connectivity at home , on the train , and pretty much everywhere thanks to marriage of @entity14 hotspots and the 4g network that has been rolled out in the @entity35			1
read related : a future with fewer mobile apps ? i look down at my phone and its large @entity40 screen			1
it beeps a second time , this time with information about my day 's itinerary , what the weather is like where i am , where i 've got my meetings and some headlines from my favorite news sites curated and cross-polled against my social circles			1
i hop out of bed , flick and swipe a command on my phone and the home music system kicks into gear , instantly playing in various rooms in the house			1
that will wake the kids up			1

we 're running short on milk , so i scan the carton with a shopping app on my phone			1
we 've got until friday before the order gets processed and sent out			1
adding bits along the way is so much easier than traipsing around a supermarket			1
i dump my phone on the kitchen counter and it starts charging			1
all the surfaces in our kitchen have the ability to give power to specific devices like the kettle , toaster , tablet or phone			1
it 's good go grab the extra juice while i can			1
in 2014 , phone batteries are quicker to charge , but they still do n't last that long			1
wireless charging points help make a difference			1
if only @entity93 would get a move on and create a commercial version of the wireless power concept they showed off in 2008 , devices might charge just by being in the same room ! breakfast done i 've got to head into @entity7 for some meetings			1
the phone goes in my pocket and off i go			1
i get to the station and touch in through the barriers with my phone			2
we 've come a long way from when phones displayed barcode boarding passes			2
now the phone has replaced the oyster card in @entity7 , using @entity113 technology embedded in the handset to confirm payments on the go			2

papers are still around , but i do n't really see the point -- it 's so easy to get curated news from a vast number of sources around the world			2
the idea of reading news from one source -- a newsroom in east @entity7 and printed over 12 hours ago -- seems strange			2
on the train i start watching a tv show i recorded on the @entity133 box last night but did n't have a chance to watch			2
i 'm skipping the adverts			2
an hour later i 'm in another coffee shop about to start my first meeting			2
this place not only has free @entity14 , but also free wireless power charging spots			1
there used to be a time when free @entity14 was enough to lure me in ; now i need power too			1
before my contact arrives i scan our last e-mail conversation			2
a quick swipe to the left and the phone 's operating system not only retrieves all our messages , but a number of social elements too about my contact and her employer			2
i discover the company she works for just announced it 's laying off 3,000 workers			2
could she be one of them , i wonder ? the meeting goes well			2
i 've had access to all the relevant files i 've needed			0
all pulled from the cloud on request , of course			0
i have a laptop , but it rarely comes out			0
it 's all tablet work these days , and when i do need to type something i 've got a keyboard on the case			0
the desktop is so 2012			0

he has just checked into a local pub , so this is a great chance to see how he is			0
i have no idea where the pub is so i launch the finder app on my phone			0
it 's basically an augmented reality city app that quickly draws me a map and indicates the right direction to start walking			0
i do n't want to be holding my phone in the air looking like a tourist			0
a quick drink later and i 've got one more meeting before heading back to the train station			0
the phone , knowing where i am , has automatically plotted the best route back , and instantly lets me know what the train times are			1
i need to hustle if i 'm going to catch the one i want			0
back onboard the train and i finish watching the tv show from earlier			0
my phone recommends another based on what my friends have been watching			0
better to start watching than listen to everyone else on the train chatting on their phones			0
the train pulls into my station and 15 minutes later i walk into my house			0
the wife and family have gone to a friend 's house so i 've still got time to pick up where i left off			0
a quick swipe on my phone turns on the television and picks up the tv show where i left it			0
this time my phone doubles as the remote			0

my phone knows that this is family time			0
while it still receives messages , e-mail and notifications , it does n't actively alert me to the fact			0
you 've got to switch off sometimes			0
a couple of hours later and i am heading to bed			0
the phone beeps , breaking the silence			0
an alert has been triggered			0
daughter number two has just got home and on stepped into a wi - fi perimeter i created around my house , prompting her phone to text mine			0
she 's back before we agreed			0
peace of mind assured , i go to sleep , ready to do it all again tomorrow			0
