-- even without the looming threat of civil war in @entity3 , flirting with a @entity5 ruler is dangerous business			1
not that the practice of extramarital affairs and illicit rendezvous is uncommon : brutal autocrats from former @entity12 president @entity11 to erratic @entity14 leader @entity13 and their sons were rumored to have sexual encounters with numerous women during their reigns			1
a trove of recently leaked e-mails purportedly from embattled @entity3 president @entity22 's inbox appear to indicate several women brazenly flirting with the father of three , some while working for the regime			1
chief among the women is @entity29 - educated @entity28 , who in one e-mail sent a photograph allegedly of herself in a skimpy bra and thong , with her @entity34 re facing the camera			1
in the cache of nearly 3,000 e-mails obtained by @entity0 , it does not appear @entity22 reciprocates her advances			0
nonetheless , in one message the young woman features a photo of a young @entity22 and the lines " so cute , i miss youuuuuuu			0
" just two days after the @entity46 published a damning report alleging that government forces committed crimes against humanity and killed more than 250 children , @entity45 wrote , " let the world see that we all are your shabeeha even the tiny little generation believes in you and is ready to fight from now			0
" the shabeeha are pro-regime militias or thugs accused of the worst atrocities and killings by the opposition			0
@entity3 forces pound @entity65 neighborhood on occasion , the schoolgirl crush takes a more serious tone as the 20 - something political science graduate appears to relay public relations advice from @entity71			1
more than five pages of suggestions for the president include advice to use language like @entity77 , the secretary - general of @entity78 , and attack @entity79 as " the real enemy			2
" in @entity84 , @entity81 , daughter of @entity3 ambassador to the @entity46 @entity83 , provided advice on @entity22 's public image abroad while occasionally sending overtly sexual notes calling the ruler " handsome " and " cute			1
" as regime forces shelled the flashpoint city of @entity65 in late january , @entity83 appears to plead for a meeting with the president : " i am coming today			2
i will arrive there tomorrow			0
and i wan na see after tomorrow			0
. miss uuu please please please			0
" @entity96 urges @entity22 to heed @entity97 among the few e-mail responses sent by @entity22 , it appears the isolated ruler is more preoccupied flirting with his @entity102 - born wife , @entity101 , than responding to adulation from other women			1
" if we are strong together , we will overcome this together ... i love you ... " @entity22 wrote his wife the day the @entity97 suspended its monitoring mission in @entity3 because of a spike in violence			1
days later , the 46 - year - old ophthalmologist - turned - autocrat doodled an elaborate sketch of a large pink and red heart on an @entity117 and e-mailed it to his first lady			0
@entity101 , who boasts in one e-mail to a friend that she is the " real dictator " in her relationship , reciprocates the affection , once writing her husband a short poem			2
" sometimes at night , when i look to the sky , i start thinking of you and ask myself , why ? why do i love you ? i think and smile , because i know the list could run on for miles			0
" as the president 's inbox filled with schoolyard flirtation and adoration , the regime continued a bloody campaign that the opposition says has decimated entire towns and claimed thousands of lives .			2
