-- as millions of @entity2 think about how they can do better in 2014 through their @entity5 resolutions , president @entity1 might want to make a few of his own			1
although it is true that the president has faced a horrendous political environment -- filled with tea party @entity10 intent on obstructing every proposal and media that are often too willing to report dubious facts -- @entity1 has not made his situation much easier for himself			1
in a number of areas , he might think about strategies that can improve his political standing and put him in a better position for the political fights over immigration , the budget , climate change and foreign policy that loom ahead			2
treat your democrats well : president @entity1 has not taken enough care of @entity27 on @entity30			1
throughout the year , @entity27 have continued to express frustration with the @entity32 for putting them into extraordinarily difficult political situations and sometimes leaving them to stand alone as they face the fallout			1
senate majority leader @entity37 was reportedly angry with the president for failing to give his caucus any credit for helping him to get out of the jam with the health care website			2
" i did communicate to him , " @entity37 told @entity44 , " that there have been things done by the @entity32 that improved the health care bill , and those fixes were suggested originally by my senators , and they got no credit for it			1
i thought that was improper			0
" last week , @entity32 democrat @entity54 criticized the administration for not listening to the advice of civil rights leaders regarding appointments for the federal bench in @entity60			1
this story fits a familiar pattern that has created ongoing tensions with @entity30 since 2009			0
@entity1 needs to remember that his fate is closely tied to the @entity27 on @entity30 -- @entity37 and @entity32 minority leader @entity65 should be his best friends -- and he needs them to help him in his struggles with @entity10			1
sweat the small stuff : there is considerable evidence that president @entity1 seems uninterested with detail			1
his major concern is in the big picture , trying to find ways to achieve his long - term policy goals , whether that be a diplomatic solution to the nuclear buildup in the @entity78 or achieving health care reform , without as much interest in the nitty - gritty of how these policies will happen			2
it is true that any president needs to keep his eye on the big picture in order to avoid the fate of president @entity88 , who became so mired in the minutiae of policy that he lost his ability to lead the nation through crisis			1
but as former secretary of state @entity94 says in his famous presentation about leadership , " check the small things			0
the devil is in the details ; sometimes the solution to a sticky problem , too			2
do n't sweat the small stuff , but do n't ignore it , either			0
" the dangers of president @entity1 's approach became apparent with the rollout of health care reform , in which the president and his team were not on top of the details of implementation in the weeks leading up to the launch of the website , and they allowed technical mistakes to turn into a huge political fiasco			1
the continual delays over implementing other parts of the program have also caused huge embarrassment and offered fodder to his political enemies			0
the president ca n't afford for this to happen again			2
he will need to hold more of his staff accountable for these kinds of mistakes , bringing in some fresh voices , as he has done with @entity128 , and getting rid of those who have made huge mistakes			0
he needs to realize that making sure that the small stuff is in order is essential to big achievements			0
control the conversation : for a president who is as professorial as @entity1 , it is difficult to accept the harsh reality of the media world within which @entity140 operates			1
it is an environment where spurious information goes viral and political rhetoric appears as fact			0
the blogosphere makes it difficult for producers and editors to control the flow of information , while the plethora of partisan reporting and commentary makes it nearly impossible for consumers of the news to separate fact from fiction			0
president @entity1 's outlook has been to sit back and allow the truth to find its way to the surface			1
he has maintained a steadfast determination that , given the facts , @entity2 will reach the right decision			0
but in our political world , this just does n't happen			0
the result has been that his opponents have been remarkably effective at shaping the national dialogue over public policy			0
president @entity1 has been forced to constantly play defense , to explain his failures and to dig himself out of holes rather than spending time talking about what he has done and what else he hopes to accomplish			1
re-energize the grass roots : when @entity1 started on his road to the @entity32 , he thrived on the energy and support he received from average @entity2 who were inspired by his call for a new kind of politics and his determination to have a campaign that was built from the bottom up			1
the local networks of campaign supporters spread the word about who this candidate was while raising money and motivating voters to line up behind his campaign			0
the enthusiasm and energy of his grass - roots supporters have grown weak			1
many of his supporters have become disillusioned with a president who seemed far too much like other politicians and who abandoned some of his key promises in areas like national security			0
the revelations about the @entity208 surveillance program were a huge blow to these constituencies			0
this is most notable with younger @entity2 , once enamored with the president but now disillusioned by broken promises on issues such as civil liberties and a still - difficult economy			0
with the 2014 midterms as a focal point , the president should get back to communicating with grass - roots @entity2 and shaping the agenda of his final years in office based on some of the issues they feel have been sidetracked in the past few years			1
@entity225 , focus , focus : over the past year , the president has frequently moved from one subject to another without a clear rhyme or reason			2
one of the few areas where a president has control is over his or her own agenda			2
during the president 's first few years , he had a laser - like focus on health care , financial reform and the economy			2
on foreign policy , he spoke to the world about improving @entity2 's relations overseas			0
that kind of focus , however , has largely disappeared			0
president @entity1 has delivered some important speeches , such as his address on inequality , but quickly moved on to other issues rather than follow through			1
throughout the battles over the budget , the president turned from one crisis to the next without stopping and really putting forth a clear vision and set of priorities in response to the austerity zeal of the @entity10			0
he has allowed his opponents to define the agenda , as opposed to the @entity32			1
even when secretary of state @entity263 moved aggressively to put into place diplomatic solutions to nuclear threats , president @entity1 seemed to follow his lead rather than outline this as a priority in foreign affairs			1
@entity1 would do well to stick to a few subjects , to articulate the direction he hopes to take the nation and move forward methodically to make sure they come to fruition			2
resolutions are easy to make but difficult to follow			0
in the world of politics , the stakes of sticking with those promises are big			0
given the tremendous difficulties that this president has faced and the dire approval ratings he is seeing , it is time for president @entity1 to double down and make certain that he does everything possible to put himself in a position to strengthen his presidency , his party and his nation in his final years in the @entity32			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity291 .			2

@entity291 : president @entity1 should adopt resolutions for 2014
he says the @entity32 should work more closely in *coordination* with @entity27
@entity1 should focus on setting agenda , details of policy and quality of staff work , he says
@entity291 : @entity1 should aim to *recapture* enthusiasm he stirred in grass roots
