@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 judge warned @entity4 against calling " for the jury 's destruction " shortly after the polygamous sect leader said friday during his sexual assault trial that those who prosecuted his church would face " sickness and death			1
" the comments that precipitated the warning to @entity4 , who has been granted the right to represent himself , occurred around midday after judge @entity17 had sent the jury out of the @entity0 courtroom			1
" i , the lord @entity20 of heaven , ask the courts to cease the prosecution of my holy ways , " @entity4 said			2
" there will be a judgment against all those who prosecute the church			1
... i shall let all people know of your unjust ways			0
i will bring sickness and death			0
" @entity34 then told him that " if you call for the jury 's destruction " while the jury -- who will decide if @entity4 is guilty on two counts of sexual assault on a child -- is present , " you will be removed from the courtroom			1
" the defendant responded by saying , " i am not threatening			0
i am releasing a message			0
" the exchange was one of several contentious ones friday , when the one - man defense team ended his self - imposed silence by repeatedly interrupting prosecutors and launching into a diatribe on religious freedom			1
@entity4 ' trial stems from a 2008 raid on a ranch near @entity57 , @entity1 , run by his church , the @entity58			1
this trial addresses the two sexual assault counts , while @entity4 is expected to be tried later on a related bigamy charge			1
several people took the stand friday , including a doctor who conducted dna tests on one of @entity4 ' alleged sexual assault victims and her baby ; a @entity1 child protective services agent who took part in the raid ; and an @entity75 agent who took various items from the ranch			1
representing himself , @entity4 interrupted when @entity75 agent @entity79 began to describe what he found on a computer seized in the raid			1
@entity83 said the computer contained lists of people living at the ranch , including their names , ages and birthdays			0
@entity4 then spent about an hour objecting to @entity83 's testimony on the grounds that it violated religious freedom , claiming the @entity75 agents " touched upon what we find sacred to salvation			1
" " this must stop , in a land ... where we maintain the constitutional right of religious freedom , " he said			1
" we are not a fly - by - night religious organization that just appeared within your borders			2
this is sacred to us , and must remain sacred			0
" but prosecutors responded that @entity4 ' @entity110 arguments were not valid in this case			2
over frequent interruptions by @entity4 -- including more than six in a row -- they argued that freedom of religion does not extend to polygamy or infringing on a child 's rights			1
the judge later advised @entity4 to seek counsel from his former attorney			1
@entity121 of the @entity1 @entity122 , who was one of those who took custody of the children after the raid , testified that the 12 - year - old girl whom @entity4 alleged sexually assaulted resembled @entity129 with her red hair and freckles			1
@entity4 objected to the girl 's picture being shown in court , and argued that her name should not be released			1
a @entity1 ranger who was part of the raid , @entity139 , described to jurors how he went into the compound 's temple			1
@entity4 interrupted him on numerous occasions , calling his testimony " an intrusion , a desecration of sacredness			1
" " i 'm requesting true justice and protection of religion , " the defendant said			0
@entity4 had voiced similar views thursday , when he argued that he felt no counsel could adequately represent him in order for " true justice to be served			2
" after warning him of the challenges of representing himself , @entity34 granted @entity4 ' request to effectively fire his attorneys			2
but the judge declined to push back the opening arguments , which were scheduled for later that afternoon			0
prosecutor @entity160 told jurors that they would hear an audiotape documenting the sexual assault of a 12 - year - old girl			1
he also promised to present dna evidence proving that @entity4 fathered a baby girl with a 14 - year - old girl			2
but when the time came for @entity4 -- who had been verbose earlier in the day -- to talk , he instead sat quiet			2
he remained that way , with his head down , for about a minute as jurors looked back and forth between him and the judge			0
@entity34 said she understood that , by @entity4 ' silence , he had chosen not to give a statement			2
then she gave prosecutors the go - ahead to start calling witnesses			0
the judge previously had told jurors that she expected the trial could last two to three weeks			0
but that was before @entity4 won the right to represent himself			2
on friday , prosecutors said that they had worked late into the night readjusting their approach and vowed to rest their case by next tuesday			0
@entity4 ' breakaway sect is believed to have about 10,000 followers			2
their practice of polygamy , which the mainstream @entity192 renounced more than a century ago , is part of their doctrine			0
the sect 's leader , @entity4 , was on the @entity75 's @entity198 when he was arrested five years ago during a routine 2006 traffic stop in @entity200			1
he was convicted in @entity201 of two counts of being an accomplice to rape , for using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14 - year - old girl into marrying her 19 - year - old cousin			0
afterward , he was sentenced to two consecutive prison terms of five years to life			0
but in july 2010 , the @entity210 overturned his convictions , ruling that the jury instructions were erroneous			0
@entity201 attorney general @entity213 told @entity214 this week that he would be open to putting @entity4 on trial again in his state			2
meanwhile , the @entity1 legal proceedings were set off after about 400 children were taken from the sect 's @entity219 in 2008			1
child protection officials said they found a " pervasive pattern " of sexual abuse on the ranch through forced marriages between underage girls and older men			0
but the @entity228 ruled the state had no right to remove the children			0
the court also said the state lacked evidence to show that the children faced imminent danger of abuse			0
most of the children were returned to their families , although some men at the ranch were charged with sexual abuse			0
@entity2 's @entity241 and @entity243 's @entity242 contributed to this report .			0
