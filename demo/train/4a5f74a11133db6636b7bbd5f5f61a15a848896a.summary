@entity0 , @entity1 -- the days of discussions have ended , demands issued , concesssions made and a decision finally reached -- but even before they formed a government , the @entity4 's political parties must wait for approval from one more person : the queen			1
labour leader @entity13 on tuesday announced his resignation as prime minister and said he was recommending his @entity17 rival @entity16 as successor			2
as a head of state , @entity19 has numerous traditional roles when it comes to elections and government			1
although these are usually no more than ceremonial , they are a key part of the protocol without which nothing can happen			0
before he could fully resign @entity13 asked the queen 's permission			0
likewise , @entity16 -- whose conservative party is trying to form an alliance with the third placed @entity35 to secure a parliamentary majority -- had to be invited by the queen to replace @entity13			1
full story : political rivals jockey for power the queen is the embodiment of @entity4 's constitutional monarchy and everything is done in her name			1
no laws can be passed nor parliaments opened or dissolved without her approval			0
such strict protocols bind all stages of the process to install a new prime minister -- often with a pomp and grandeur far removed from the boisterous world of @entity4 politics			1
the 2006 film " @entity57 " offered insight into this when @entity61 , playing the monarch , invites a nervous and kneeling @entity62 to become prime minister after his 1997 landslide victory			0
in her six decade reign , @entity19 has dealt with 11 prime ministers , including @entity67 and @entity68 , who reputedly had a tense relationship with the monarch during the weekly audiences that are also a traditional necessity			1
typically , although it is her role to anoint prime ministers , the queen does not get involved in the political process , remaining above the fray			1
after an election , the queen will wait to see if the current prime minister gets a majority or assembles a coalition before inviting them to form a government			2
only if they admit defeat and resign can she start to look elsewhere			0
as negotiations to form a coalition progress , the queen will be kept informed from a distance , avoiding any direct involvement in the decision			2
a high level group including her private secretary and the cabinet secretary will brief her , but she will not be drawn into controversy			0
but , in the unlikely event that no decision can be reached among the parties over who should become prime minister the queen does have powers to intervene			1
she can , in theory , call a fresh election or stop a new election being called if she thinks there is another solution			0
the queen has faced election hiccups before			0
the last was in 1974 when after days of party negotiations , she invited @entity113 to form a minority government			0
that administration lasted less than a year before @entity4 was back at the polls			2
it usually falls to royal advisers to ensure the rules work and that the queen is kept well away from the political wheeling and dealing .			2

@entity4 prime ministers must be invited to take up the role by the queen
@entity19 has dealt with 11 prime ministers including @entity67
queen does not get involved in political decision making but has power to intervene
