@entity0 -- when @entity3 and @entity4 dropped their only son @entity5 off at medical school , they were both proud and tired			1
they had to hurry home to care for an ailing elderly parent			2
" it was a fast drop , " recalled @entity5 's father , @entity4			1
neither had any idea what their son was about to face or they never would have left him there			0
@entity17 , 19 , a freshman ( or " fresher , " as they are called in @entity19 ) was about to embark on a torturous six months that would end his life			1
@entity5 , along with his new dorm mates , suddenly became the target of " ragging , " a form of bullying or hazing usually inflicted by upperclassmen on freshman			1
taller than his classmates , handsome and fluent in @entity32 , @entity33 , and conversational @entity34 , @entity5 was wise beyond his years , his parents say			0
he had always been able to sort his problems out himself so they could n't imagine him being intimidated			0
" there is a whole guilt factor involved in all this that i did n't know [ what was going on ] , " his mom @entity36 said			0
" really , i could n't understand the size of this problem			0
" his parents knew something was going on when @entity5 came home from @entity45 in @entity46 and his hair had been sheered off			0
his parents said he told them that he was being ragged but not to worry about it because it would end			0
for him , it stopped after one night in 2009 when he was woken up by a group of seniors who made him and all his dorm mates stand in a line and then began beating them			0
@entity5 later died of a head injury			1
his father talked to him on the phone in the hours before he died and heard about what happened			1
then , abruptly , his son was gone			0
when relatives went to @entity5 's dorm room to pick up his things , they found a note with the word " ragging " circled in the middle and words and phrases surrounding it such as , " @entity72 like torture , " " dictator " and " please talk to us do n't slap us			1
" it was @entity5 's innermost thoughts about ragging and how terrible it felt			2
in the hours before he died , he also managed to write a letter of complaint to police describing what happened			2
his father later read the complaint and was horrified			2
" not easy even to think about it			0
it is very difficult , " @entity85 said tearfully			0
@entity5 's death two years ago triggered national outrage			0
four medical students were later convicted of culpable homicide			0
but his is not the first , nor the last case to end in tragedy in @entity19			1
over the years , ragging on college campuses has resulted in dozens of student suicides , students being admitted to mental institutions , or students simply leaving prestigious schools that less than 1 percent of the population can get into			1
@entity85 says since his son 's case he has seen more than 30 reported suicides allegedly linked to ragging			2
the @entity4 case did effect some change , in part because @entity5 's father decided to dedicate his life to ending the torturous behavior in schools			2
now , some campuses enforce a zero tolerance policy on ragging			2
and @entity5 's father took the case to the country 's @entity113 and managed to get an order setting up parameters on ways to prevent ragging			1
now , two years later , inside a bright blue - and orange - colored room , a half - dozen young people are chatting away on phone headsets			0
but it 's not a typical @entity19 call center , apparent with the initial phone greeting : " you have reached the @entity126 , " a young lady chirps			1
the helpline was just one part of @entity85 's plan to do something about ragging			2
students can call anonymously to lodge complaints about any ragging behavior			1
in its first six months of operation , he says the center received 150,000 calls from students saying they were victims			1
" those numbers in the last two years have gone to 250,000 calls with 850 serious complaints , and we still believe this is only the tip of the iceberg , " @entity85 said			0
he says he 'll keep fighting every day in @entity19 until the day the phones at the complaint center fall silent -- because students are no longer being victimized by ragging at school .			1

in @entity19 , " ragging " is a bullying or hazing usually in college
@entity17 died after a ragging *incident* at his school
his father has tried to *create* awareness and opened a call center for victims
