-- the ceo of @entity2 , @entity3 , has some advice for you : do n't wash your jeans			1
as in do n't wash them ... ever			1
speaking at @entity10 's @entity9 conference , @entity3 said he was sporting a pair that had " yet to see a washing machine " in over a year			2
worried about germs , you germaphobes ? no problem , he says			0
just stick your jeans in the freezer once a month next to the frozen waffles to kill off the bacteria			2
apparently getting them icy will neutralize the sweat , coffee spills and other bodily fluids that might collect in the zipper or " seating " area			0
he also suggests spot cleaning with a sponge or a toothbrush			0
while that could work for the stuff on the outside of your jeans , what about all the stuff your body cooked up that 's on the flip side ? once you get ' em back up to body temperature , wo n't you be warming up those germs again ? yuck			1
@entity41 freezing has become quite the craze in the past few years			0
it even comes with its own video tutorials and folding techniques posted online by bloggers around the country			2
interesting , but somehow i doubt an overnight stay in the freezer is going to silence the filth festival that accumulates on a pair of jeans over the course of wearing them for 30 days straight			2
the only time i tried jean freezing was during a family fishing trip a few years ago in the @entity59			0
we " washed " a load in the river and hung a line up for our laundry to dry overnight			0
i woke up to unexpected frost and a pair of @entity67 that felt like plywood			0
if you think it 's hard to pull on your jeggings , ladies , try cracking open a pair of jeans that are frozen solid			1
@entity3 claims that not washing your jeans keeps them in mint condition and helps conserve water			1
but what about conserving the cleanliness of your lower extremities and not subjecting your colleagues to the stench of dirty denim ? have you ever cooked bacon or mucked a stall in a pair of jeans ? it 's a gift that keeps on giving			1
and with this thought , it has dawned on me			0
he 's not talking to people like my @entity97 , who rise with the sun to work the @entity100 cattle farm that 's been in my family for generations			1
he 's talking to people who like to look fancy in their jeans			1
the people that benefit most from not washing denim are the ones who 'll throw down what is for many @entity109 a monthly salary to buy something they 'll never wash , because , quite frankly , they 'll probably be worn no more than four times before their next new pair of jeans			1
and listen , science says this " freezing jean " phenomena does n't stand up to analysis			1
in plain @entity120 : no , freezing your jeans will not kill all bacteria , but throwing them in the microwave just might			0
@entity125 , a @entity126 expert on frozen microbes suggests " you either raise the temperature to 121 degrees @entity129 for at least 10 minutes or just wash them ! the latter surely is the best alternative to save energy			2
" he adds : " one might think that if the temperature drops well below the human body temperature they ( bacteria ) will not survive , but actually many will			0
many are pre-adapted to survive low temperatures			0
" then again , since much of a ceo 's job is to drum up as much marketing buzz as possible , it 's no wonder that @entity3 is making this unsanitary claim -- thereby bringing @entity146 's back to the forefront of a conversation			1
even if it makes him smell like a farm animal .			0

@entity152 : @entity146 's ceo says save water , do n't wash your jeans , freeze them to *freshen*
@entity157 : that 's gross
she says science does n't support this , even though there 's lots of online info on how to do it
@entity157 : people who buy new jeans *frequently* could do it ; for the rest of us , it 's unsanitary
