-- a few weeks ago col. @entity1 , a @entity2 officer stationed in @entity3 , fell victim to a particularly modern hazard of war : @entity8 fatigue			1
col. @entity1 was fired from his post at @entity12 's @entity11 after he wrote an essay for the @entity15 wire service in which he voiced his frustration about @entity8 - obsessed officers who spend more time worrying about font size and bullet points than actual bullets			1
col. @entity1 's was just the latest in a series of complaints about the military use of slide presentations -- you may recall public ridicule of the famously incomprehensible " spaghetti slide , " and a recent @entity29 article , that cited other officers just as frustrated with the emergence of the military bureaucracy 's " powerpoint rangers			1
" but @entity8 is n't inherently bad -- just misunderstood			1
and bad @entity8 presentations are n't just a concern of the military			1
we 've all sat through presentations -- or suffered or even dozed through them			1
the truth is , most are poorly constructed and instantly forgettable			2
why does this matter ? because presentations decide elections , military strategies and multibillion - dollar business deals ; they educate our children and they spread the ideas that shape society 's most important goals and directives			1
ultimately , a presentation succeeds or fails on the strength of its message and how well it 's told			2
and those elements have nothing to do with the brand of the software package involved in its production			2
you know instantly when you 're watching a great presenter at work -- you may even own the @entity65 to prove it			1
sometimes , presenters try to punch up weak content with stunts			2
i remember one speaker who rode onto the stage on a motorcycle -- and promptly lost control and crashed			2
) another presenter rappelled down to the stage like a mountain climber			0
i remember the stunts , but not the messages			0
poor presentations can have disastrous consequences			1
@entity80 , perhaps the most important writer on the display of information , demonstrated how the disintegration of the space shuttle @entity85 in 2003 might have been averted by a more objective presentation of the damage inflicted on @entity85 's wing by a piece of foam debris during takeoff			0
as it was , @entity80 wrote in his article , " @entity94 : assessing the @entity106 and @entity107 , " @entity96 officials came away from @entity8 - driven briefings by @entity99 engineers with an overly optimistic view of the situation , in part as a result of hard - to - understand slides overloaded with bullet points			1
in other words , a bad presentation may have caused that disaster , and a good one might have prevented it			1
of course , we ca n't be naive : a persuasive presentation is n't necessarily a good presentation			1
in 2001 , @entity115 executives @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 presented @entity8 slides at an employee meeting that winningly depicted the company 's robust health and the bright future of its projected earnings			1
by the end of that year the company was worthless			0
eventually , the @entity127 @entity126 charged those executives with 10 counts of a variety of crimes -- based on their presentations			1
meanwhile , the @entity115 scandal may have been preventable by the right presentation			0
in 1999 , a presentation by the @entity136 accounting firm feebly warned the @entity138 's audit committee of the company 's sketchy accounting			0
had that presentation sounded a bold warning , the audit committee might have been able to save the company			0
for that matter , it might have saved @entity147 , which did not recover from its role in @entity115 's dealings			0
unfortunately , the development of presentations is a skill that is rarely taught and for which few sources of best practices exist			1
bad presentations kill ideas , waste money and impede progress			1
great ones illuminate , persuade , generate consensus and spark action			1
how do you create a great presentation ? i 've been in the business for 20 years , but until recently even i could n't define the deep structures and elements of truly superior presentations			1
my research into this question led me in unexpected directions			0
the answers i found had nothing to do with technology or the internet ; they were revealed in screenwriting , @entity180 and @entity181 drama , mythology and literature			0
great presenters employ the basic narrative techniques used throughout history to connect with audiences and move them to action and new understanding			2
the presentations that work are not the ones with the most data or the most elaborate charts and graphs ; the winners are those with the most compelling and convincing narratives			1
we 're a distracted , multi-tasking society			0
so presentations need to lure and re-lure an audience simply to keep their attention			2
audiences are looking at the clock or fiddling with their handheld devices throughout a presentation			0
you do n't connect with your audience by throwing information at them -- you do it by taking them on a journey toward your perspective			2
whether you 're a ceo , a salesperson , a general or a biochemist , you must understand how to connect with an audience , how to construct a powerful narrative argument , and how to visually display information for maximum audience comprehension			0
i read recently that our nation is suffering a crisis of literacy , with only 35 % percent of high school seniors able to read proficiently			0
yes , you read that correctly ( assuming you 're not part of the 65 % of high school seniors			0
) but literacy really means the ability to communicate effectively			0
for professionals and citizens in every strata of society , true literacy now includes the ability to communicate effectively through presentations			2
the stakes could not be higher for our country			0
if corporate executives communicate poorly , businesses and the economy suffer , and jobs are lost			0
if teachers communicate poorly , our children do n't learn and advance			2
if generals communicate poorly , our troops and their missions are put at risk			0
these are dangers we can not ignore			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity253 .			1
