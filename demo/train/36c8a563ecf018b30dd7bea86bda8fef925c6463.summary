-- " what kind of sneakers is she going to have to wear ? " this is one of many questions going through my head			1
it is september 2003 , and i just found out my daughter is going to be born with @entity10			1
i am only 16 years old , just days away from my 17th birthday			1
i am a good student , sister and shoe lover			1
( hence the reason why sneaker choice would be one of my great fears about this baby 's diagnosis			1
) i do not want to deal with @entity20 versus ties or orthopedic shoes ; i want to pick out the latest trends and styles for her			1
with this diagnosis , i am now faced with the challenge of redefining every goal and dream i had for my daughter			1
i am scared , naturally			2
my friends are all out celebrating senior year , and here i am asking myself stupid questions			2
after a few agonizing days i realize she is my child			2
does it really matter what kind of shoes she has on ? it does n't			2
this child is n't even born yet , and she has already taught me a lesson			2
i no longer care about shoes and shopping ; i just want my baby to live			1
i want her to be born healthy and be happy			2
so i make up my mind that just because she has @entity10 , i do n't have to give up all of my dreams for her			1
i can still buy her cool sneakers and shoes ; we just might need to look harder for ones that offer support as well			2
opinion : do n't label people with @entity10 a month goes by and @entity54 is born -- a healthy 4 - pound , 12 - ounce baby girl with a head full of black hair			1
she was born with a heart defect , but it gets corrected six months after birth			0
a little while after that , she begins wearing her new pink @entity63 crib shoes			0
most babies grow out of those kinds of shoes soon after birth , but not my little @entity68			0
@entity10 can slow physical and intellectual development			1
she rocked those shoes for a good couple of months			0
these days , @entity54 is doing well			0
she goes shoe shopping with me and her current pick is a multicolored pair of @entity63 high tops			0
i do n't think she truly cares about shoes but just enjoys spending the time with me picking them out			0
she teaches me and her teachers more than we teach her			0
i am so happy that i was blessed with her and that she changed my views on life			0
had she not been born with @entity10 i do n't think i would be as good a person as i am now			1
i currently organize a @entity86 with some other moms , and we use funds from the walk to donate care packages to families facing hospital stays due to complications of @entity10			1
@entity54 is almost 6 , and this year was our fifth @entity95			0
i started the walks in honor of her , and it is because of her that i can reach out to other families now			0
having a baby with @entity10 made that 17 - year - old me grow up fast but strong			1
@entity54 is such a special child			0
she takes her time when most of us want her to rush , and she is always the one smiling when everyone else is melting down			0
she will not let the world define her			0
she will keep doing what she loves , in great shoes , just to make me happy .			0
