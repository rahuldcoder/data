-- the last time @entity3 was in the news , it was full of teeny - tiny plastic police officers , a whole lot of teeny - tiny protest signs , and one scrawny evergreen tree			1
that 's the kind of place it is , all 452 square inches of it			2
what 's billed as the world 's smallest park , tucked inside a concrete circle just 2 feet across , is a quirky @entity19 kind of place			1
it 's the site of itty - bitty protests -- including that 2011 occupy @entity19 protest covered by @entity0 affiliate @entity24 -- teensy - weensy swimming pools and way small diving boards -- for the diminutive butterflies , of course			1
and then , for a short time it seems , someone stole its lone tree			2
the diminutive evergreen disappeared sometime last week from the downtown street - corner park , @entity24 reported , citing the @entity35			1
it was more of a crisis than you might think : the place is also reputedly the home of leprechaun @entity41 , whom the @entity44 columnist @entity43 claimed granted him a wish of having his own park			1
according to the parks department , @entity43 planted flowers in an unused hole in the median outside his newsroom office way back in 1948			1
he frequently wrote about it in the years before his death in 1969 , frequently weaving in fanciful tales involving @entity41 and other leprechauns , according to numerous accounts of the celebrated little park			0
the city took it over on @entity61 in 1976 , and good - natured park workers have tended to the tiny plot ever since			1
so , on discovering the tree was gone , of course they quickly scraped up $ 3.25 for a new one , hurried downtown and planted the replacement before the notoriously fickle - tempered leprechaun could make any trouble , @entity24 reported			0
the new tree is a @entity74 sapling , @entity0 affiliate @entity71 reported			0
" it was important to replace it so the leprechaun there had some shade from the sun , " a suitably deferential park official , @entity81 , told @entity24			0
but just after the tiny replacement tree was planted , the old tree returned			2
a driver noticed the diminutive tree friday " roots and all , lying on its side just outside the park , " @entity84 said			2
some wondered if tree bandit had felt remorse			0
" whatever the motivation , we are relieved , " says @entity84 director @entity93			0
but police were still on the case			0
" remorse does not mean case closed ' , " says @entity98 sergeant @entity97			0
" we will pursue ... our investigation and hope that justice is served , and served swiftly "			0
