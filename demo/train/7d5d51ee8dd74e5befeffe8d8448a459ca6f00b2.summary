@entity0 , @entity1 -- scores of @entity4 who claim they were abused by @entity6 troops are demanding an independent inquiry into their treatment , via a lawsuit against the @entity6 government this week			1
at least 125 @entity4 allege they were subjected to mistreatment including sleep deprivation , hooding , being forced to stand or kneel in stress positions , or being exposed to " loud pornography			1
" the mistreatment was not the work of rogue soldiers disobeying orders , but part of a " deliberate policy of abuse being used to assist interrogation , " lawyer @entity23 argues			1
the " allegations indicate systematic abuse of detainees which reflect policies of the @entity31 or at least tolerated and widespread practices , " he says in court papers			2
he showed interrogation videos in court on friday and planned to introduce more evidence monday and tuesday , he told @entity2			0
the allegations center on a unit known as the @entity38 , about which @entity23 says he has been able to obtain little information			0
in court papers he says it was responsible for detainee interrogation and control , calling it " effectively a black hole , a segregated and tightly controlled environment operating under a separate chain of command			0
" the @entity48 did not immediately respond to @entity2 questions about the interrogation team			1
the @entity51 requires the government to establish an independent investigation in the abuse allegations , @entity23 says			2
defence minister @entity56 , the defendant in the @entity58 case , is " very concerned " by allegations of abuse and is determined to " get to the bottom " of all such allegations , his lawyers said monday			1
but he does not believe he is under " any present obligations to set up a public inquiry			0
" the @entity48 says the @entity65 are investigating allegations case by case			1
a two - year project under its jurisdiction , known as the @entity70 , was announced earlier this year			0
@entity56 believes that process is " desirable and appropriate " in investigating abuse allegations , and has made " significant progress " since it was established , government lawyers said			1
the @entity70 " is the most effective way of investigating these unproven allegations -- to establish their truth or otherwise , identify any action that needs to be taken , including dealing with any connected or systemic issues and , should it uncover criminal behavior , provide the proper means to deal with it , " said brigadier @entity75 of the ministry 's @entity77 department			1
" in our view a costly new public inquiry is not necessary or appropriate			0
it would be unable to investigate individual criminal behavior or impose punishments and will not serve the interest of fair and expeditious justice , " he said in a statement			0
@entity23 says that investigation is only putting off an inquiry that is certain to come			0
" there is no justification for delaying the inevitable , " he argues in court papers			1
he says the military 's investigation is not sufficiently independent			2
and sending cases through the @entity106 before setting up an independent probe " offends " the @entity51 requirement for prompt investigations in allegations of abuse , he says			2
the case opened friday and is due to continue through tuesday			2
it is not clear when the judge will rule			0
@entity2 's @entity115 and @entity116 contributed to this report .			0

125 @entity4 claim they suffered abuse such as hooding and sleep deprivation
the abuse was part of a " deliberate policy , " their lawyer argues
the @entity48 says it is investigating case via a *special* *commission*
the lawyer says that 's just delaying the inevitable
