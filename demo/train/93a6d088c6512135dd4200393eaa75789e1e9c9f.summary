-- scientists have discovered the remains of a rodent the size of a small car which used to forage the @entity7 continent			1
the 1 - ton creature is believed to have been about 3 meters in length and 1.5 meters tall			0
the fossilized skull of the new giant rodent the giant rat 's skull , which measures an impressive 53 centimeters in diameter was found by @entity15 and @entity16 , two scientists from @entity18 , @entity19			1
the two paleontologists stumbled upon the fossilized remains in a broken boulder in @entity23 along the coast of @entity19			2
by looking at the size ratios of the skulls and bodies of existing rodents , scientists determined the bodyweight of the rodent must have approached 1,000 kilograms or a ton , making it the world 's largest rodent to have been discovered to date			1
the relatively small size of its teeth however , suggests it fed mainly upon soft vegetables and fruit			1
" we can give an educated guess that the rodent would have been 3 meters long -- assuming that it was similar to a @entity44 ( the largest rodent alive today ) and taking it into account that large mammals generally have relatively smaller heads			0
it 's tail probably was closer to the one of capybara or guinea pig ( very short ) and not like a rat , " @entity16 says			0
the scientists believe the rodent , named @entity57 , roamed the earth about four million years ago at the same time as other giant creatures , such as terror birds , saber - toothed cats , ground sloths and giant armored mammals			2
during this period , the now arid region was forested and rich in vegetation			0
the largest living rodent is the capybara , a 50 kilogram guinea pig found in @entity7			0
