@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 authorities are asking for dna samples from families of missing persons nationwide in their efforts to identify 49 decapitated bodies , an official said wednesday			1
that will be the only way to identify the victims -- whose killers cut off their heads , hands and feet -- @entity17 state security spokesman @entity16 told reporters three days after investigators found the remains abandoned along a highway			1
officials in @entity23 may also request access to the @entity26 data authorities in @entity17 have compiled , to compare it with samples from family members of @entity23 migrants who have gone missing in @entity1 , @entity16 said			1
while investigators work to identify the victims behind closed doors , parts of the case have played out quite publicly			1
banners hanging in locations throughout the country , purportedly from the @entity39 , claim that the notoriously ruthless cartel had nothing to do with the gruesome crime			1
but another message purportedly signed by the @entity39 and found sunday at the crime scene -- a roadside near the industrial city of @entity0 and about 80 miles southwest of the @entity48 border -- told a different story , threatening members of rival cartels and @entity1 authorities			1
domene told reporters wednesday that investigations to find those responsible would focus on scientific proof and not on the banners			2
on monday , @entity1 's interior minister said the 49 decapitated bodies were likely the result of a fierce feud over territory and power between the @entity39 and members of the allied @entity66 and @entity67 cartels			1
the @entity39 started with deserters from the @entity1 army and quickly gained a reputation for ruthless violence as the armed branch of @entity1 's @entity66 cartel			1
the partnership ended in 2010			0
now , analysts say the @entity66 cartel is allied with the @entity76 , one of the nation 's most powerful drug - trafficking groups			2
interior minister @entity80 stressed monday that the @entity1 government would not retreat from its efforts to crack down on organized crime -- an effort that is facing increasing criticism as @entity1 's presidential campaign season heats up			2
" i know very well that these acts worry society , but the solution is not to let our guard down , " @entity80 said			0
president @entity92 , seen as the chief champion of @entity1 's crime - fighting strategy , is not running for re-election			2
but opposition candidates have criticized his administration 's approach			0
more than 47,500 people have died in drug - related violence in @entity1 since december 2006 , when @entity92 announced plans to deploy troops in efforts to combat cartels			0
according to @entity1 's @entity106 , more than 5,300 people have disappeared throughout the country in that same time period			0
and the bodies of 9,000 dead have not been identified			0
officials fear the total number of missing could be far higher , because many disappearances go unreported			0
