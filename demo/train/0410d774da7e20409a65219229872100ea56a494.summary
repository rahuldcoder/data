the @entity6 , stinging from a letter by senate majority leader @entity1 and dozens of fellow @entity2 calling on the league to force the team to change its racist name , apparently fumbled a desperate @entity7 appeal to fans			1
" @entity11 to show your @entity12 and tell him what the team means to you , " the maligned team wrote to its 305,000 @entity7 followers on thursday			1
but be careful what you ask for , especially on @entity7			1
" this team has zero self - awareness.lol , " one person tweeted			1
" @entity21 fan and i strongly believe it is time to change the name , " wrote another			1
" how do you not see what a bad idea this is , " said another tweet			0
" please do n't do this to yourself			0
do n't , " another person wrote			2
@entity31 , @entity1 's digital director , said the majority of responses favored a name change			1
" in the five to 10 minutes following it , we were pleasantly surprised by the overwhelming outpouring of opposition to the team , " he said			2
" it was 50 to one at one point			0
" @entity6 spokesman @entity43 said the claim reminded him of the famously incorrect " @entity46 " banner headline			0
" they declared victory within the hour and as the night went on , more and more momentum swung our way , " he said			0
" that 's the good thing about our country			2
people can express themselves and have a healthy dialogue			0
" in a letter to the @entity58 last week , the senators stepped up pressure on the league to force the @entity6 to change their name by invoking the heated racial controversy triggered by basketball 's @entity63			1
" i would hope that the team does reflect on why there was so much organic opposition to the name , " @entity31 said friday			2
" i do n't know if they 're living in bunker mentality over there and do n't realize that this name has caused so much anger			0
but if they are in that bunker mentality , hopefully ( thursday 's @entity7 response ) causes them to climb out of that and see the fact that there is a lot of deep - seeded opposition and anger to the name			1
" responding to the senators ' letter , @entity6 president @entity85 invited @entity1 to a game to " witness first - hand that the @entity6 are a positive , unifying force for our community in a city and region that is divided on so many levels			1
" @entity85 said the term @entity6 originated as a @entity98 expression of solidarity , and that the team logo was designed by @entity101			1
@entity102 , a spokesman for @entity103 of central @entity104 , said the team 's @entity7 appeal demonstrated how much the @entity6 underestimate the passions surrounding the issue			1
" this is a complete disregard for those that are calling for a change , " he said			2
" it 's a fundamental misreading of the issue at large			0
" last week 's letter , signed by 50 @entity2 senators and released by @entity1 , urged pro football 's commissioner , @entity117 , to take action over concerns that continued use of the @entity6 brand is offensive to @entity101			0
they asked @entity117 to follow the lead of @entity126 commissioner @entity125 , who took tough measures against @entity128 after the longtime owner of the league 's @entity130 was recorded making comments offensive to african - americans			2
" today , we urge you and the @entity58 to send the same clear message as the @entity126 did : that racism and bigotry have no place in professional sports , " the letter said			0
responding to the @entity143 letter , the @entity58 said last week it has " long demonstrated a commitment to progressive leadership " on diversity			0
" the intent of the team 's name has always been to present a strong , positive and respectful image			1
the name is not used by the team or the @entity58 in any other context , though we respect those that view it differently , " the league statement said			0
lawmakers step into @entity6 name fray			0

team 's @entity7 appeal to fans appears to *backfire* , say *proponents* of name change
one person tweets : " this team has zero self - awareness "
another tweets : " @entity21 fan and i strongly believe it is time to change the name "
team president @entity85 : name began as @entity98 expression of solidarity
