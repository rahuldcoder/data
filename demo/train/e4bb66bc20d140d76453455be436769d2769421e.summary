-- a drive - through bib , a travel bidet and other outrageous but true products : normally , we strive to bring you the best and most innovative tools for your journeys , but today we just wanted to have some fun			1
a bib that puts you in the driver 's seat if your road trip is too fast - paced for sit - down dining , strap on a @entity16 and do n't think twice about dribbling drive - through delicacies all over your clothes			1
the bib -- modeled above by @entity0 staffer @entity20 -- hooks over the shoulder , and any food that falls short of your mouth should wind up in a four - inch pouch that 's waterproof and , we assume , ketchup - and mustard - proof , too			1
dans - products.com , $ 8			1
when every drop counts a full six feet wide , the tandem - like @entity27 should adequately keep two people from getting wet while exploring a new city			2
unfortunately , while the jumbo shield doubles your coverage from the rain , it also doubles your dorkiness as tourists			2
@entity38 : 19 stunning fall foliage photos a guilt - free way to let loose if the person sitting next to you on a flight plops down a @entity47 " flatulence filter seat cushion , " should you make a stink and ask to switch seats -- or be thankful your gassy neighbor was considerate enough to come prepared ? tough call , especially if the cushion in question is the " @entity57 " model , covered in football - patterned fabric			1
the seat 's carbon filter -- designed to muffle the sound and absorb the smell of breaking wind -- is supposed to be replaced every three to six months for most users ... but more frequently for tailgaters who consume lots of beer			1
a sorta - portable hardware store versatility is the big selling point for @entity73 tools , but this @entity74 -- which weighs two pounds , serves 141 functions , and costs a whopping $ 1,400 -- is ridiculous			2
and it 's not only the price that 's impractical			2
just imagine the trauma of watching it get tossed into the confiscated bin at a @entity81 checkpoint			2
the coolest small towns in @entity84 ooh la la : a travel bidet if you 're one of the eight or nine @entity84 who 's accustomed to using a bidet at home , you 'll definitely want to know about the battery - powered @entity90 , which enables you to wash up down below at hotels and restrooms that have n't yet embraced this @entity94 hygiene fixture			0
it comes with two nozzles , two aa batteries and a sleek gray travel bag			1
sit back , relax , and slip on a @entity100 not every flight has a blanket for every passenger and -- come to think of it -- no flights have blankets with sleeves			0
but fear not ! a petite , travel - size @entity100 conquers both of those conundrums and costs $ 8 less than the original @entity100 , which is intended primarily for couch use			0
@entity113 's @entity112 bedbugs beware available in two - ounce bottles easily taken on the go , @entity116 's all - natural bedbug spray claims it repels and kills bedbugs and bed mites			0
but we have to raise the issue : if you think you 're going to need to use this on your vacation , perhaps you should be staying at a different hotel			0
@entity127 , $ 6 for two 2 - ounce bottles			0
@entity130 protection bruised produce can be a bummer , but do n't let that stop you from traveling with your favorite delicate fruit			0
the plastic @entity135 -- available in five colors and in one unmistakable shape -- safeguards snacks from getting banged around in your bag			1
flexible and extendable , it can accommodate all but the largest bananas			0
