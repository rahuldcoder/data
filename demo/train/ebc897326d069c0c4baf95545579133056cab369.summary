-- respiratory illnesses caused by an enterovirus are sending hundreds of children to hospitals throughout the @entity6 and @entity7 , health officials say			1
twelve states are reporting clusters of enterovirus illness : @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
six of those states -- @entity12 , @entity19 , @entity21 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity16 -- have confirmed cases of @entity25 , also known as @entity26			1
enteroviruses , which can cause a variety of symptoms , are n't unusual			2
if you 've ever had a bad summer cold , it was likely caused by an enterovirus			1
the @entity34 estimates there are 10 to 15 million viral infections each year in the @entity37			0
the season often hits its peak in september			0
" it 's important to remember that these infections are very common , " said dr. @entity40 , assistant surgeon general for the @entity41 and the director of the @entity43			0
but this particular type of enterovirus -- @entity49 - @entity48 -- is less common			1
and health officials are concerned by the number of hospitalizations it has caused this year			0
" it 's worse in terms of scope of critically ill children who require intensive care			1
i would call it unprecedented			2
i 've practiced for 30 years in pediatrics , and i 've never seen anything quite like this , " said dr. @entity61 , division director for infectious diseases at @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity18			1
what parents should know about @entity49 - @entity48 staff members noticed an initial spike on august 15 , @entity69 said			1
" it could have taken off right after school started			0
our students start back around august 17 , and i think it blew up at that point , " @entity69 said			0
many of the children who are being hospitalized have a history of asthma or wheezing , says dr. @entity83 , medical director of infection control at @entity12			0
@entity49 - @entity48 seems to exacerbate any breathing problems that are n't under control with medication			1
survive the september asthma epidemic @entity12 has seen a 12 % to 15 % increase in emergency room visits and admissions this month compared with the same time frame last year , @entity83 said			2
the hospital sent 25 samples to the @entity34 from patients with respiratory illness			2
around 75 % were confirmed to be @entity26			1
on monday , the @entity34 confirmed that 11 samples it tested from children who had been hospitalized in @entity99 tested positive for @entity26			1
nineteen of the 22 specimens sent to the @entity34 from @entity64 also showed signs of the virus , meaning there is likely a regional outbreak			0
the @entity16 @entity106 confirmed that @entity26 cases have been identified in that state			1
officials are hearing of illnesses across the state , they say , though there is not a firm count of how many people have been infected			2
why enterovirus infections are difficult to track @entity26 was first identified in the 1960s , and there have been fewer than 100 reported cases since that time			1
but it 's possible that the relatively low number is due to the fact that the @entity34 does n't require health departments to track @entity26			1
" it 's one that we do n't know as much about as we would like , " @entity40 said			0
@entity26 was seen last year in the @entity37 and this year in various parts of the world			1
over the years , clusters have been reported in @entity14 , @entity128 , @entity129 and various countries , including the @entity131 , @entity132 and the @entity133			2
health officials do n't know why the enterovirus has created such a problem this year			2
" that 's the scary part -- the unpredictability , i think , " @entity83 said			0
the unusually high number of hospitalizations reported could be " just the tip of the iceberg in terms of severe cases , " said @entity145 , a virologist and director of the @entity34 's @entity147			1
as states continue to send samples to the @entity34 , the public health agency will get a clearer picture of the number of viral infections being caused			2
in the meantime , parents should be on the lookout for signs that their child is having difficulty breathing			0
other common symptoms of the virus include coughing , fever and rash			0
" it 's important to make sure your children with asthma are on their medicines and keeping up with their medication routine , " @entity40 said			0
like other enteroviruses , @entity26 appears to spread through close contact with infected people			2
to reduce the risk of infection , wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds , especially after changing diapers			0
avoid touching your face with unwashed hands , and avoid contact with people who are sick			0
disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as toys and doorknobs , and stay home when you feeling under the weather to avoid infecting others			0
@entity0 's @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 contributed to this report .			0
