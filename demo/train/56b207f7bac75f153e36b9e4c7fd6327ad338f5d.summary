@entity0 , @entity1 -- there has been lots of talk by officials about @entity1 , specifically about the disputed region of @entity8 and it possibly joining @entity9			1
there have been threats of sanctions and other punitive measures against @entity14 , for allegedly supporting this breakaway from @entity1 , in spirit and in action			2
troops -- some uniformed , some not -- have been seen in and around the region , raising worries , even if no one has been shot			0
but could something big and decisive be coming soon ? for as tense as things are now , the fear is that things could deteriorate quickly and bloodily			0
the trigger may be sunday 's vote in @entity8 , where voters can formally set the stage for its secession from @entity1 and becoming part of @entity9			1
@entity9 's increased flexing of its military might has heightened the tensions and raised fears of an imminent invasion , especially after the referendum results come in and the dominoes start falling			2
thousands of @entity9 paratroopers , artillerymen and more on friday continued a large - scale military drill near the @entity1 border			1
on the same day , armored truck after truck toting long - range guns and other military equipment rumbled through northern crimea			2
already , eight @entity1 military units in @entity8 have been taken over , 22 others are blocked , and 49 of 56 border patrol stations are in similar straits , @entity1 's foreign ministry said			1
@entity55 's new @entity54 - leaning government -- which came to power following the ouster of president @entity58 , who fled last month after succumbing to intense public pressure in part for aligning more with @entity14 and less with the @entity61 -- has insisted that @entity1 's territorial integrity , including @entity8 , must be respected			1
@entity14 has been equally steadfast in its support for ethnic @entity9 and abiding by voter 's ' wishes in @entity8			1
@entity67 's defense minister , @entity66 , warned friday that @entity1 is on the verge of a full - scale military conflict unless @entity9 president @entity71 's hand is forced			1
" it is clear that we are at a crossroads , " @entity73 @entity72 ban ki - moon said friday			0
" if positions continue to harden and rhetoric continues to sharpen , there is great risk of a dangerous downward spiral			0
" neither side is budging			0
@entity9 so far has refused any direct talks with @entity1 's new leaders , but its foreign minister , @entity85 , has talked daily with @entity86 , met face - to - face with him last week in @entity88 and the diplomats met again for more than five hours friday in @entity90			1
afterward , it appeared -- as has been the case for weeks -- the only thing @entity9 and the @entity94 agree upon is that they ca n't agree on anything of substance			1
as @entity85 said friday , " we do n't have a common vision			1
" @entity86 : actions ' calibrated ' if @entity9 open to talks while the @entity9 foreign minister and his team did engage in talks friday , calling them negotiations may be a reach			1
as @entity86 said , @entity14 was n't going to do anything until the @entity8 referendum 's results are released , likely monday			1
in fact , @entity85 did n't have any authority to even negotiate on anything to do with @entity8 , according to a senior @entity114 official			1
his boss , @entity71 , reiterated friday that sunday 's vote is in line with international law and the @entity73 charter , a @entity116 statement said			0
a day earlier , @entity9 @entity73 ambassador @entity122 asked why @entity123 do n't deserve a right to self - determination , just like anyone else			2
@entity1 's new government , as well as @entity54 leaders , see it differently			0
while @entity122 accused the @entity54 of having " fanned the flames of unrest , " officials there accuse @entity9 of instigating and furthering the crisis -- including sending troops into @entity8 to blockade and seize @entity1 military and other facilities , something @entity14 has denied			1
@entity88 nations and the @entity94 have already hit back some , with targeted punishments in addition to offers of billions in aid to @entity1 's fledgling government			1
the situation seems to have had an impact already within @entity9 , as evidenced by steep declines in its stock market and the value of the ruble			0
and the @entity114 cautioned @entity94 about traveling to @entity9 given " the possibility of violence or anti- @entity94 actions directed against @entity94 citizens or @entity94 interests			1
" @entity86 warned friday that the " consequences " will be far more stringent should @entity71 sign off on the " back - door annexation " of @entity8			2
at the same time , he opened the door for less strident measures should @entity9 opt not to take in @entity8 -- whatever the referendum says -- and instead go along with more autonomy , human rights monitoring and other steps for that region if it stays part of @entity1			1
" if there is greater diplomatic opportunity that can be pursued -- and that is , in fact , on the table -- then i 'm confident that whatever the response is would be calibrated accordingly , " @entity86 said			0
" but if ... a decision is made that is negative and / or flies in the face of all of the rationale that the @entity61 and others have put on the table for the illegality ( of an annexation ) , that will obviously demand some further response			0
" for his part , @entity85 called friday 's conversations -- which he characterized as " negotiations " -- as " useful , " even if they did n't produce a breakthrough			2
he added he 's aware of what might happen if @entity8 becomes part of @entity9 , saying sanctions wo n't help anyone			1
" i assure you that our partners understand that sanctions are counterproductive ... and ( they ) will not facilitate mutual interests , " he said			0
unrest , military action continues some 1,500 miles away from these seemingly calm , cordial discussions , @entity8 continues to boil			2
col. @entity196 , the head of a military hospital associated with @entity1 's foreign ministry , was " kidnapped " friday evening in the @entity8 capital of @entity0 , a @entity1 defense ministry spokesman for @entity8 said			1
" his kidnappers cuffed @entity196 's hands behind his back and drove him away , " said @entity202			0
" his whereabouts are currently unknown			0
" meanwhile , in northern @entity8 , video shot by @entity2 showed green trucks rolling in the direction of @entity210 , home to a key military airfield			1
they appeared loaded , including some with long - range artillery guns			0
who was driving them , and for what purpose ? one of the vehicles had a @entity9 license plate , but the other had no plates at all			0
and men connected to the convoy refused to answer @entity2 's questions on the matter			0
@entity1 officials have repeatedly claimed that @entity9 troops are among the armed men that have , effectively , taken over @entity8 on the heels of the local government 's decision to side with @entity14 and against @entity55			1
@entity9 has denied any direct involvement , saying what 's happening in @entity8 is an internal matter			2
the powerful nation has n't been shy , however , about military activities on its side of the border with @entity1			1
its defense ministry has said about 8,500 artillery personnel were staging snap military exercises not far from @entity1 's eastern border			2
@entity94 ambassador to the @entity73 @entity245 estimated " at least 10,000 " @entity9 troops overall were involved			2
" this is the second time inside of a month that @entity9 has chosen to mass large amounts of force on short notice without much transparency around the eastern borders of @entity1 , " a senior @entity114 official said			2
meanwhile , six @entity9 jet fighters were moved to @entity256 in @entity257 on thursday , @entity9 state news agency @entity254 cited the @entity258 as saying friday			0
the move is part of @entity257 ' offer to @entity9 to participate in joint military drills , the news agency reported			2
@entity257 , a former @entity265 republic , borders @entity9 and northern @entity1			1
@entity9 's defense ministry released video friday showing paratroopers floating downward as part of those drills			0
should @entity14 launch a full - fledged invasion of at least @entity8 , they should prevail , said @entity273 , the director of @entity275 , or the @entity275 , in @entity14			0
@entity9 has more than four times the amount of troops as @entity1 , not to mention exponentially more tanks , armored personnel carriers and ships			1
" there is no fortification			0
there is no military infrastructure , " @entity273 said			0
" that is why i think it would be quite easy and quick			0
" @entity2 's @entity287 reported from @entity8 , and @entity288 reported and wrote from @entity289			0
@entity2 's @entity290 and @entity291 in @entity292 , @entity293 in @entity0 and @entity294 in @entity55 contributed to this report			0
@entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 and @entity302 also contributed .			0

@entity94 warns @entity94 in @entity9 about possible " violence or anti- @entity94 actions "
@entity94 , @entity9 talks go nowhere : " we do n't have a common vision , " @entity85 says
@entity86 : @entity9 has a choice , will pay price if it annexes @entity8
