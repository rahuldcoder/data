@entity0 -- the @entity3 is reopening its investigation into the death of movie star @entity6 , who drowned in 1981 while boating off @entity7 near the @entity9 coast , authorities said thursday			1
homicide investigators are taking a new look at one of @entity16 's most enduring mysteries after they were contacted by people who claimed they had " additional information " about the drowning , the sheriff 's department said in a statement			1
authorities did n't provide further details late thursday and said a news conference on the matter will be held friday at 11 a.m. ( 2 p.m. et )			1
last year , the actress ' sister , @entity27 , and the captain of the yacht on which @entity6 sailed with her husband , actor @entity30 , had asked the sheriff 's office to reopen the case			1
on thursday , @entity34 sheriff 's deputy @entity33 could n't say whether the sister and the yacht captain have prompted the renewed investigation			1
" i do n't know if that 's related , but that 's what the press conference is about tomorrow , " @entity33 told @entity1			1
@entity6 once said in a televised interview that her greatest fear was of dark seawater			1
on november 29 , 1981 , she drowned in the @entity45 off the isthmus of @entity7			1
@entity6 's body was found floating in the water about a mile away from the yacht			1

the autopsy report shows @entity6 had two dozen bruises on her body , including a facial abrasion on her left cheek , and bruises on her arms			1
" my sister was not a swimmer and did not know how to swim , and she would never go to another boat or to shore dressed in a nightgown and socks , " said @entity27			0
although the county coroner 's office ruled that @entity6 's death was an accident , others say the case has n't made sense			1
in 2010 , @entity27 told @entity1 she believes a highly charged argument between her sister and husband on the yacht 's back deck preceded @entity6 's drowning			1
she told @entity1 last year she does not suspect foul play			0
" i just want the truth to come out , the real story , " she said last year			0

it was published in september 2009			0
@entity85 has said he believes @entity6 's death was a direct result of the fight with @entity30			1
@entity27 and @entity85 could n't be reached immediately for comment thursday			0
@entity30 's publicist @entity97 issued a statement saying the actor 's family " fully support the efforts of the @entity101 's @entity100 and trust they will evaluate whether any new information relating to the death of @entity6 is valid , and that it comes from a credible source or sources other than those simply trying to profit from the 30 year anniversary of her tragic death			1
" @entity97 said no one from the sheriff 's department has contacted @entity30 or anyone in his family about the case			1
in a lengthy interview with @entity1 in 2010 , @entity85 said he now believes the investigation of @entity6 's death was incompetent and suggested there was a cover - up			1
he said he regrets misleading investigators by keeping quiet at @entity30 's request			2
@entity6 and @entity30 married in 1957 , divorced in 1962 , then remarried in 1972			2
they often sailed their yacht off the coast of @entity9 and they invited @entity6 's " @entity131 " co-star , @entity130 , to join them on a sail on @entity134 weekend in 1981			1
@entity130 and @entity6 had been filming " brainstorm " at the time and the @entity16 rumor mill was abuzz with speculation that @entity30 was jealous over @entity130 , but authorities have said @entity130 witnessed only the events leading up to an argument between the couple			2
@entity130 could n't be reached immediately for comment thursday			0
@entity30 admitted his jealousy in his book " @entity146 , " also published in september 2009			0
he acknowledged that there had been a fight with @entity6 , writing that he smashed a wine bottle on a table			2
after @entity30 argued with @entity130 and broke the wine bottle , @entity6 left in disgust and went to her stateroom , @entity85 told @entity1 last year			2
@entity130 also retired to a guest room , @entity85 added , and @entity30 followed his wife to their room			0
a few minutes later , @entity85 said , he could hear the couple fighting			0
embarrassed , @entity85 said he turned up the volume on his stereo			0
at one point , @entity85 recalled , he glanced out of the pilot house window and saw both @entity30 and @entity6 on the yacht 's aft deck			1
" they 'd moved their fight outside ... you could tell from their animated gestures they were still arguing , " he said			0
a short time later , @entity30 , appearing to be distraught , told @entity85 he could n't find @entity6			2
@entity85 searched the boat but could n't find her			0
he noticed the rubber dinghy also was missing			0
@entity30 shrugged and poured them both drinks , @entity85 said			0
he suggested his wife had probably gone off in a temper			0
@entity30 's story , as told in his book , differs from @entity85 's			2
he maintains that after the argument with @entity130 , @entity6 went to her room and prepared for bed while he and @entity130 sat on the deck , cooling off			2
@entity30 writes that he went to check on @entity6 , but she was n't there			2
he maintains that he and @entity85 searched the boat and noticed the dinghy was missing			0
@entity30 wrote that he assumed his wife had gone ashore on her own			0
he radioed the restaurant on shore where they 'd had dinner and called the harbor master to see if anyone had seen @entity6			2
the dinghy was found about a mile away from the yacht , and a mile from where @entity6 's body was found			1
@entity6 's first starring role was as a child in " @entity202 " in 1947 , and she played alongside some of @entity16 's top leading men -- @entity205 in " @entity206 " and @entity207 in " @entity208			1
" she was nominated for @entity210 in both of those films , as well as for " @entity212 " ( 1963 ) , according to @entity213			0
one of her more memorable roles was as @entity215 in " @entity216			0
" @entity30 's striking good looks landed him roles in dozens of films in the 1950s and ' 60s before he hit it big in television			2
he starred in two popular series , " @entity226 " ( 1968 - 70 ) and " @entity227 " ( 1979 - 84 ) , and more recently as number two in the " @entity225 " spy spoofs			0
