a deeply divided @entity0 nudged the nation toward broad recognition of same - sex marriage on wednesday in rulings that advocates hailed as a " joyous occasion " -- but still left many questions unanswered			1
voting 5 - 4 in each of two decisions , justices threw out part of a law that denied hundreds of federal benefits to same - sex couples and cleared the way for gays and lesbians to once again marry in @entity16			1
at the same time , the high court declined to make a sweeping statement on the broader issue of same - sex marriage rights nationwide , rejecting @entity16 's same - sex marriage ban but leaving intact laws banning such marriages in 35 other states			1
@entity25 has civil unions for same - sex couples , while @entity29 's marriage law is gender neutral and recognizes valid marriages performed in other states			1
while the rulings fell short of the goal same - sex marriage advocates have set -- eliminating all laws limiting the rights of gays and lesbians to marry -- celebrations erupted outside the @entity0 , as well as in @entity39 and around the country			1
map : same - sex marriage , state by state in @entity50 , the couples who sued to dismantle the @entity46 and its ban on federal benefits for same - sex couples emerged from the @entity0 to thunderous cheers , simply holding their arms aloft in victory			1
in @entity39 , @entity54 , who had already set a date for his wedding in the wake of the decision , said there was too much to celebrate to be disappointed by what the rulings did n't do			0
" i 'm confident that opinion in the @entity63 is shifting towards being in favor of same - sex marriage , so it will simply take more time and allow the nation to come along in a way that will provide more lasting support for equality , " he said			1
opponents of same - sex marriage saw both peril and promise in the rulings , expressing dismay in the court 's decision on the @entity46 but taking some comfort in the decision not to dismantle same - sex marriage bans nationwide			1
" their refusal to redefine marriage for all states is a major setback for those seeking to redefine natural marriage , " said @entity83 president @entity82			0
" @entity90 is not on the side of those seeking to create same - sex ' marriage			2
' " what 's next for gay rights movement ? what the rulings say in its divided ruling on the federal @entity46 , the high court said legally married same - sex couples must receive the same benefits provided to heterosexual couples			1
the act had defined marriage as only between a man and a woman , but the court said the law violated the rights of same - sex couples by demoting their marriages to second - class status when compared to their heterosexual peers			1
the court said law wrongly " instructs all federal officials , and indeed all persons with whom same - sex couples interact , including their own children , that their marriage is less worthy than the marriages of others			1
" now , the federal government recognizes the marriage of those same - sex couples who are legally married in their states			1
more on the @entity46 ruling a divided high court also handed a victory to same - sex proponents when it cleared the way for gay and lesbian couples to marry in @entity16 , dismissing an appeal to the state 's voter - approved @entity135 that banned such marriages			1
the 5 - 4 decision avoids , for now , a sweeping conclusion on whether same - sex marriage is a constitutional " equal protection " right that would apply to all states			2
more about the @entity135 ruling practical impact in addition to restoring same - sex marriage in @entity16 , the decisions will eventually allow same - sex couples in states where they 're legally allowed to marry to apply for retirement , survivor and other benefits as married couples			1
they 'll also be able to benefit from hundreds of other federal programs that have been , until now , reserved for heterosexual married couples under the @entity46 's definition of marriage as between a man and a woman			2
but exactly when they 'll get those benefits is unclear			0
what the rulings mean in terms of taxes , benefits after the decisions were announced , president @entity170 ordered a review of federal statutes to ensure the ruling is " implemented swiftly and smoothly			1
" but he did n't give a more precise timeline			0
defense secretary @entity176 said he would work to get benefits to service members as soon as possible			0
" that is now the law , and it is the right thing to do , " he said			0
it 's also unclear when same - sex marriages might resume in @entity16			1
gov. @entity184 said he wants marriage licenses to begin flowing to gay and lesbian couples the moment the 9th @entity189 confirms that a court order preventing their issuance has been lifted			0
attorney general @entity192 said weddings could begin as soon as the order is lifted , which she said she was urging the court to do quickly			2
in @entity199 , the county registrar 's office said they 're ready			0
@entity200 celebrates : guess who 's getting hitched ? " could n't be more proud ' same - sex marriage advocates were , in a word , elated			1
" i did not count on them moving this far , " said @entity205 attorney general @entity204 , who called it the rulings " an incredible victory			2
" " today 's historic decisions put two giant cracks in the dark wall of discrimination that separates committed gay and lesbian couples from full equality , " said @entity211 , president of the @entity212 , who called the rulings " a joyous milestone			1
" " while we celebrate the victory for @entity16 today , tomorrow we turn our attention to the millions of @entity225 people who do n't feel the reach of these decisions , " he said			2
@entity229 student @entity228 was waiting outside the @entity0 for the decision with her girlfriend , @entity231 , when the word came down			0
" i do n't even have words			0
i 'm just so happy , and just overwhelmed with emotion , " she said			0
" i could n't be more proud of my country and of the @entity0 today			0
i 'm so happy to be here and be a part of it			0
" ' a devastating thing ' of course , not everyone was pleased by the ruling			0
while public opinion has shifted strongly toward support of same - sex marriage in recent years , many conservatives , particularly faith - based conservatives , find the idea of same - sex marriage incomprehensible and dangerous			2
the rev. @entity248 , president of the @entity249 , found the decision on the @entity46 , written by justice @entity251 , immensely troubling			0
" @entity251 's opinion takes us to the brink of nationwide same - sex marriage			1
and i believe that will be a devastating thing for this country , " he said			0
yes it will , said @entity260 of the @entity261			0
" when you destroy or redefine the institution , all of society will be harmed , society that 's put such stock in the institution as a counterbalance to government and the way we raise and educate our children , " he said			2
reaction among the @entity63 religious community others on both sides found mixed messages in the rulings			0
@entity280 said he initially cheered wednesday 's @entity0 ruling that essentially recognizes same - sex marriages			1
but , he told @entity284 's @entity283 , " as soon as i read some of the news articles describing the decision , it sucked for us and for the majority of same - sex couples living in states with state marriage bans			1
" @entity280 , 50 , married @entity291 in @entity16 before @entity135 was overturned			2
the couple now lives in @entity293 where same - sex marriage is n't recognized			2
" are we still second - class citizens ? " he asked			0
he called wednesday 's ruling " an expensive baby step			0
" on the other side , the rev. @entity299 , chairman of the @entity300 , said he was disappointed " in the short - term results and the short - term questions that remain unsettled			2
" " but , " he said , " the public conversation continues and that 's a good thing			0
" what about couples who still ca n't marry ?			0
