-- coming off a coup that initiated a new loop in the roller coaster of @entity7 's political scene , the country 's future is up in the air -- and with it , the future of the entire region			1
@entity11 , a former @entity12 senior adviser , calls @entity7 's turmoil " the most titanic political contest of our era			1
" what could lie ahead ? here , @entity0 experts -- some of them on the ground in @entity7 -- and analysts weigh in on a handful of possibilities : opposition consumed by infighting @entity7 who packed @entity26 's @entity25 to call for the ouster of president @entity28 -- a longtime leader of the @entity30 -- had vastly different agendas			1
some wanted a return to the days of ousted president @entity34 ; others had supported @entity28 and were disappointed by him			0
going forward , do n't expect the factions to work together easily , says @entity0 's @entity37 , who has covered the region for years			1
" infighting is inherent in the opposition and one of the strengths of the @entity30 is their cohesiveness			2
... the opposition suffers from arrogance and ego			0
each leader believes he is better than the others			0
" no single charismatic leader has risen to unite the opposition , @entity37 says			0
meanwhile , the @entity30 's unity could help it rise again			1
the opposition could change in time , says @entity11 , as secular liberals who oppose @entity30 rule come together			2
" ultimately , liberals do get organized , but it often takes time , " he writes on @entity0 's @entity56 blog			1
the question is how long the country has before @entity7 take to the streets en masse rejecting the military leadership -- like what happened after @entity34 was ousted in 2011			2
if the military fails to draw a consensus and move the transition swiftly , it could face a revolt , says @entity0 producer @entity68 in @entity26			2
if recent history repeats itself , the military will " crush dissent with brute force and you have the whole fiasco all over again			0
" 8 issues @entity7 is facing @entity30 pushed into ' confrontational posture ' there is " terrible tension and fear among some in @entity7 today " that the @entity30 " will be forced underground again and into its historic , confrontational posture with the @entity7 army , " says @entity82 , @entity0 's chief international correspondent and anchor of @entity82			1
the country 's chief @entity30 movement certainly wo n't ' be driven into extinction , " says @entity0 senior international correspondent @entity84 , who has covered @entity7 for years			1
" despite the fact that many people are fantasizing that this is the end of the @entity30 movement , " the country will continue to " have to deal with the @entity30 either as a political movement or underground movement , " he says			2
some @entity7 " want to see the @entity30 crushed , " @entity84 says			1
" it 's been shoved into a corner but wo n't take it lying down			1
" that could spell armed protests by the @entity30 and its supporters , he says			2
@entity0 's @entity26 - based international correspondent @entity101 adds , " getting aggressive with the @entity30 risks a violent backlash that could lead to further turmoil			1
" @entity104 defers judgment on @entity28 ouster ' last nail in the coffin ' for @entity109 if turmoil and violence reign in @entity7 , the global effects could be dramatic			1
" one of the great triumphs of the @entity109 was that it showed islamists who were prepared to come into the political process and accept the democratic path forward rather than the violent jihadi future that @entity120 and @entity121 were espousing , " @entity82 says			0
@entity28 won a democratic election only to be deposed through non-democratic means			0
" what are you going to tell @entity116 : that democracy is for everybody except them ? " @entity82 asks			0
the coup " could well foretell an end of the fledgling democratic experiment in the most populous @entity134 country which , by overthrowing its long - term dictator just a couple years ago , had inspired democracy movements around the @entity134 world , " says @entity128 of the @entity129 , in a column for @entity0			2
" if the @entity7 military is allowed to get away with this unconstitutional act it may spell the end of democracy in @entity7 for a long time to come ; " he says			2
" it will also be the last nail in the coffin of an @entity109 already teetering on the edge of the grave with a bloody civil war raging in @entity150 , brutal suppression of democracy activists in @entity153 , and near - chaos in @entity155 and @entity156			0
" compromise , fair constitution there is a more positive possibility if @entity7 takes the right steps , experts say			1
" various political parties will need to learn to compromise , " @entity37 says , and the @entity30 needs to be engaged , not marginalized			2
@entity164 , @entity7 's acting foreign minister , told @entity82 that he has reached out to the @entity30 to keep them in the political process			1
that may not be enough to quell the fury of the @entity30 and @entity28 supporters , who say that " nothing will satisfy them short of having @entity28 reinstated as president , " @entity101 says			0
but building a constitution in a way that shows a commitment to representing the will of the people could have a big impact , says @entity179 , senior fellow with the @entity180 , in a @entity0 column			1
" if @entity7 approve , through a fair and open referendum , a new constitution that reduces @entity116 's role , it will take the wind out of the sails not only of the @entity30 , but of political islam across the region			1
" bread riots , water wars many who follow the region closely say the central question of @entity7 's future is summed up by the famous @entity196 adage : " it 's the economy , stupid			1
" in a country grappling with poverty and unemployment , any new government that wants to maintain power needs to work quickly			0
if the situation worsens , " people may rise up because the price of bread is too high and they just ca n't feed their families , " @entity84 says			0
" if that happens , it 's utter chaos -- back to 1977 and the bread riots in @entity26			0
... that 's the gut worry of everyone			0
" meanwhile , @entity7 's quickly growing population and limited water supply " could lead to the likelihood of water wars in the future if @entity218 basin countries like @entity219 divert the flow of the @entity218 , " @entity37 says			1
the country needs to restore order to the streets immediately , increasing the presence of police despite their lack of popularity , @entity37 says			0
" it really is all about the economy and security			0
" @entity234 exerts pressure suspending @entity104 aid " would plunge an already bankrupt country into deeper chaos , " @entity236 , host of @entity0 's " @entity56 , " writes in a column			2
" but @entity234 should announce that it will continue its aid for a limited period , say two months , while it determines whether the new government is in fact moving to restore genuine democracy in @entity7			0
" the @entity104 should call for an end to arbitrary arrests ; a constitutional process that includes " all major voices in @entity7 life " ; and elections open to all , " including and especially the @entity30 , " @entity236 says			1
but do n't expect any proactive steps from @entity234 , says @entity11 , the former @entity12 adviser			0
the will for @entity104 and its allies to help the secularists organize , " and the tools to do that with , both appear to be in mothballs , " he writes , adding , " @entity234 will again leave crucial matters to chance			0
" from hope to despair : @entity7 slides into economic uncertainty , again			0

@entity7 's future will have a *profound* global impact , analysts say
the @entity30 wo n't fade out of existence , @entity0 experts say
if the economy falls further , riots could follow
compromise and a constitution offer opportunities for *stability*
