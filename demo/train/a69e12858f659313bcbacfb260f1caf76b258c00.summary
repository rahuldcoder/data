-- at the group of 20 summit in @entity3 , president @entity4 and @entity5 had their first face - to - face meeting since @entity5 resumed the @entity8 presidency in may			1
the joint statement they issued afterward indicated several issues ( including @entity12 and @entity13 ) that the two sides would seek to cooperate on , but it did not announce any significant agreements to do so			0
more telling were the visual images when the two presidents were together ; @entity4 appeared to be doing his best to project an image of warmth and friendliness , while @entity5 was stiff and reserved , as he usually is with other world leaders			1
it appeared that @entity4 was earnestly seeking to befriend @entity5 , but @entity5 was not reciprocating			1
why would @entity5 behave this way ? it may be because , unlike @entity4 , he may not be looking for opportunities to cooperate , nor be embarrassed about forgoing them			1
he appears to have a much more transactional approach to foreign policy , running something like this : @entity32 wants @entity33 to adopt the @entity35 approach to @entity12 and @entity13 and several other issues			2
but it is unwilling to make concessions to @entity33 to get it			0
two such concessions would be abandoning ballistic - missile defense plans that @entity33 finds threatening and repealing the @entity43 - era @entity42 that continues to limit @entity8 - @entity35 trade			2
but much to @entity33 's frustration , @entity32 is either unwilling or unable to accommodate @entity8			1
so why should @entity8 accommodate @entity35 ? news : @entity4 and @entity5 discuss @entity13 , other topics during two - hour talk the @entity4 administration would undoubtedly respond that surely @entity5 does not want @entity12 to acquire nuclear weapons , and thus should fully cooperate with the international effort to prevent this			1
and as @entity53 , @entity4 's director for strategic communications at the @entity55 , was quoted as saying monday about @entity13 , " we 've been working to get the @entity8 to come in line with , frankly , the broad international community			1
this is not just an issue between the @entity35 and @entity8			2
" surely @entity8 would not want to defy the " broad international community " on @entity13			0
especially when it comes to @entity13 though , @entity5 and the @entity8 foreign policy establishment believe that @entity35 and the " broad international community " have missed the point			1
as bad as @entity67 's regime may be , @entity8 believes its downfall will be far worse for everyone , and not just @entity8			2
the @entity8 believe the most likely consequence would be the rise of a radical @entity73 regime or a drawn - out civil war			0
either way , far more people will be killed			0
nor does @entity33 see increasing sanctions -- much less the use of force -- as being effective in resolving the @entity12 nuclear crisis			0
@entity33 does n't see itself as willfully and wrongly defying " the broad international community			0
" it genuinely believes that @entity35 and its @entity82 allies are pursuing misguided policies toward @entity13 and @entity12			0
for @entity4 to think he can get @entity33 to adopt the @entity35 approach without compensation is simply an insult to @entity5			1
the @entity4 administration needs to understand that @entity35 can not have its borscht and eat it , too			0
if it wants @entity8 's cooperation on @entity13 and @entity12 , it is going to have to make significant concessions to @entity33 on other issues			2
@entity32 must now decide whether the cooperation it wants from @entity8 is really worth that			0
@entity13 exposes cool spots in @entity35 - @entity8 ties the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity101 .			1

@entity103 : @entity4 and @entity5 said they *'d* cooperate but did n't say how they would
he says @entity4 appeared to want to befriend @entity5 at @entity107 , but @entity5 was stiff and reserved
he says if @entity35 wo n't accommodate @entity8 , @entity8 wo n't accommodate @entity35
@entity101 : @entity8 thinks @entity35 mistaken on @entity13 and regime 's *ouster* will bring worse *carnage*
