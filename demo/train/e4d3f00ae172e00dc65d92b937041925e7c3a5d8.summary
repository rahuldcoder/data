-- pounding humidity , a treacherous climb and bees who were more than happy to sting : tough conditions for ash boarding down a live volcano , and halfway up @entity11 's @entity10 , it did n't seem like such a good idea			1
but then there was the view : a cascade of grey - black ash and rock stretching to the horizon , giving the hilly landscape an alien quality			2
we walked in single file carrying our boards and a bag full of gear for nearly an hour until we reached the summit			0
approaching the edge of the volcano , the 1,600 foot slope was pretty steep and uninviting			2
our guide consoled us with the knowledge that we were lucky to have our plywood and metal boards as someone else had gone down the volcano on a bicycle			2
still , i donned my prison - style boiler suit and goggles , sat on the board and let myself slide			0
it was a thrill as i quickly gathered speed , scraping over pebbles and eating flying grit until i finally wiped out at the bottom			0
the activity is one of @entity11 's more unusual tourist hooks			1
pioneered by the @entity53 owner of a hostel in the nearby city of @entity56 in 2005 , ash boarding down @entity51 's youngest volcano has become a cottage industry			1
the @entity59 hostel is now owned by @entity61 @entity60 , who says the tourism industry is becoming more competitive as it develops			1
" when @entity59 first started it , it was something new			0
and then it became bigger and bigger			0
this brings a lot of business , " says @entity60			0
he says hotels and hostels in @entity56 have grown from two to more than 40 in seven years			0
" this to be honest is the main income of the hostel , if it did n't have the ash boarding it would just be a hostel and it becomes very difficult to survive			2
" tourism 's role for many , especially in the @entity80 , @entity11 is associated with 1980s - era @entity82 guerillas and the @entity83			1
corruption and @entity80 embargoes certainly took their toll on the country and by the time the @entity89 left power in 1990 , the tourism industry was a basket case			1
yet @entity11 has always had huge potential			1
known as the " @entity94 , " it has immense natural beauty and alluring colonial towns			0
it 's still very underdeveloped -- the second poorest country in the hemisphere -- and you can expect to experience power cuts and traffic jams behind horse carts on main highways			1
per capita income is barely more than $ 1,200 a year , so for a country like @entity11 , tourism is actually the second largest industry -- and an engine for lifting the population out of poverty			1
the latest figures for this year reveal an increase in visitors of 12 % from 2011			0
" the tourism industry of @entity11 has been growing at an important rate in the last few years , " says @entity114 , the country 's tourism minister			1
" and it 's becoming one of the two or three top generators of foreign currency and employment for our country			1
" a mandatory destination on any itinerary is @entity127			0
perched on @entity11 , the largest lake in @entity51 , the city is renowned for its stunning architecture			1
it was founded by the @entity131 in 1524 and subsequently razed three times by pirates but was rebuilt and served as a conservative stronghold during the country 's civil war			1
the city is overshadowed by the hulking @entity137 , a popular hiking destination			0
there is also a galaxy of hundreds of small islands formed from a volcanic eruption thousands of years ago and strewn across @entity11			1
driving down the lake 's malecon looking for a tour boat , it was clear waterfront development had been approached with great ambition			2
somehow the vision fell short : rows of bars , restaurants and nightclubs looked like they had been closed for months			0
once out on the lake , the tranquil tour of the islets gives you the opportunity to gawp at the holiday homes of some of the country 's richest families			1
each dominate certain sections of the economy -- such as media or brewing -- and naturally each owns an islet			2
occasional " for sale " signs rise up out of the water , and in case you 're interested , an island will set you back around $ 400,000 -- negotiable			0
country at a crossroads but be careful			2
according to the @entity178 , property laws in @entity11 are somewhat murky : " establishing verifiable title history is often entangled in legalities relating to the expropriation of 28,000 properties by the revolutionary government in the 1980s			1
" the @entity178 says this remains a key impediment to attracting greater foreign investment in the tourism industry , a claim @entity189 obviously rejects			1
" there are many international agreements that @entity11 has signed with other countries to protect the safety of foreign investment , " he says			2
" we have n't seen complications from 2007 until now and what could have happened is that the government may have verified a few properties to be completely sure of the origin of those properties			0
" the @entity89 leader @entity202 , once dismissed as a dinosaur , swept back into power in 2007 and has since been re-elected in an election condemned by international observers for its irregularities			0
many may balk at the return of such a notorious figure , but the government says he is making tourism a priority and understands the conditions needed to attract visitors			2
@entity216 has certainly maintained its inviting atmosphere			0
the laid back surfing mecca is close to the border with @entity220 and may be the ideal place to wind down your tour			0
a young @entity223 famously arrived here by boat in 1866 and was entranced by the " bright green hills " that form a semi-circle around the bay			0
then a ramshackle primitive port , @entity216 has grown into a ramshackle party town whose waterfront is lined with several bars catering to young tourists			0
during the day , the local tourism industry exploits the town 's natural blessings			1
@entity216 's main beach is largely a fishing and transit hub and the main surfing spots are a 20 - minute drive away			2
the roads deteriorate rapidly as you leave town and a 4x4 vehicle was needed to get through the final stages of one route to the beach			0
but like @entity11 as a whole , it 's worth the effort : the waves are superb and the shorelines shockingly underdeveloped and wild			1
@entity255 can head to the high seas for some world - class deep - sea fishing and may be surprised at their unusual level of success			0
@entity11 holds a great variety of experiences for any visitor , and the country is one of few states whose immediate future really is tied to the tourism industry			1
for now , it 's seemingly at a crossroads , with many of the big developers watching the turn of events .			2

@entity11 's tourism industry is a big part of the economy
while *infrastructure* is still rough in many places , the country offers some amazing attractions
volcano boarding is one of the country 's unique tourism *offerings*
