@entity0 , @entity1 -- defense secretary @entity4 praised @entity5 on more than one occasion sunday during a series of meetings with fellow defense ministers from southeast @entity10 , but hinted if relations between the @entity12 and @entity5 worsen , it could be a threat to " the security of the world			1
" he said he appreciates @entity5 's muted response to the @entity12 announcing a deal last month to sell more arms to @entity18 , and he lauded @entity5 for working with its neighbors with regards to the contentious issues involving the @entity23			1
" i would commend them for the way that they 've handled the news of that sale to @entity18 , compared to the past , " @entity4 told reporters after a meeting with @entity1 's defense minister sunday in @entity0			1
@entity5 regards @entity18 as a renegade province			1
@entity18 began as the remnant of the government that ruled over mainland @entity5 , until a @entity36 uprising proved victorious in 1949			1
the $ 5.3 billion arms package , announced last month , includes upgrades to @entity18 's f - 16 fighter fleet			2
last year , a similar deal prompted @entity5 to temporarily cut off military to military relations with @entity12			1
this time , aside from some strong objections voiced by @entity44 , @entity4 said there has been no tangible action taken in response by @entity5			1
" i 've heard nothing that indicates that they 're taking any steps in reaction to that , " @entity4 said			2
part of the reason might be the way the @entity12 government handled the sales			2
" it was something that the @entity12 had announced but we had given the @entity5 a heads up as to what was going to take place , " @entity4 said			1
" i think in the end ... they handled it in a professional and diplomatic way and we appreciate that			0
" the @entity23 , a body of water east of @entity71 , north of @entity72 and west of the @entity74 , has been a source of regional tensions for decades			0
but because of recent discoveries of massive oil reserves as well as its importance to regional maritime and aviation navigation , tensions have increased recently			0
many countries lay claims to the same parts of the sea			0
after his meeting with the @entity1 defense minister , @entity4 met with defense ministers from all eight member nations of @entity92 , the @entity92 , which includes all the nations that border the @entity23 , except @entity5			2
in remarks prepared for the start of the meeting , @entity4 said , " i applaud the july accord between @entity92 and @entity5 on implementing guidelines to the 2002 declaration on the conduct of parties in the @entity23			2
i would encourage you to maintain this momentum , and continue working towards a binding code of conduct			0
" but @entity4 said there are still some concerns regarding @entity5 's military that bear watching			1
" obviously there are some concerns about some of the things they are doing on modernization , there are concerns about some of the things they are doing with some of the more sophisticated weapons that have been developed			0
" he said @entity5 being open and letting the world know what its military is doing is key			0
" as long as they are transparent , as long as we can discuss these issues on a frank and direct basis then i think we can develop a strong working relationship			0
" he ended his discussion of @entity5 with the reporters on an ominous note about positive relations			0
" i think it would be in the interest , not only in the interest of both nations , but also in the interest of the security of the world			0

@entity5 handled news of @entity12 arms sale to @entity18 well , @entity4 says
still , there are some concerns about @entity5 weapons *program* , he says
a strong relationship with @entity5 is in the interest of global security
