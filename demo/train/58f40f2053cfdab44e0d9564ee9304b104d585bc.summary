he may be one of the most famous faces on the planet and earning in excess of $ 46 million a year , according to @entity4 , but @entity5 admits he does not have it all			1
in an interview with @entity10 , the @entity8 midfielder has spoken of the daily anguish he suffers while living in @entity12			1
for the former @entity18 captain , preparing for tuesday 's glamour @entity14 quarterfinal clash with @entity16 , is finding it hard to be apart from his wife @entity20 and their four children , all of whom are now based in @entity25			1
@entity5 to donate @entity8 wages to charity he may be living in one of @entity30 ' finest hotels , occupying a suite at @entity32 that features marble bathrooms and one of the world 's best chefs and costs thousands of dollars per night , but @entity5 says he has an even higher price to pay by staying in the @entity12 capital			1
" that 's the sacrifice i have to make as a father and as a husband : being away from my family , " he told @entity10			1
" it is only for a short time , but it 's difficult being away from the children every single day			0
they understand that @entity51 works hard			0
" @entity5 says that his eldest child , 14 - year - old @entity53 , is also beginning to understand the limitations of having one of the world 's biggest celebrities as a father			2
" my eldest now is at the age where he wants to do things and go to places , and we have to hold him back , " said the recently appointed ambassador for @entity61 football			0
" you have to explain to him that there are certain things that he ca n't do			0
but to be honest , we let our children do 99 % of the things they want to do , because we want them to lead a normal life			0
" the former @entity74 and @entity75 star joined the @entity12 side in january , and although the original deal was for five months only , @entity8 president @entity77 told @entity12 daily @entity79 on monday that he is keen to retain @entity5 's services for next season as well			1
the club 's @entity83 coach @entity82 has also indicated a desire to retain @entity5 , who makes the short flight home to the city of his birth on a regular basis to spend time with his kids , who go to school in the @entity95 capital			2
such overtures may leave @entity5 with a difficult decision to make when his deal expires in may , but with his wife keen to settle back in @entity25 after nearly a decade away -- following stays in @entity101 and @entity102 in the @entity103 -- and the footballer saying he will never play for any @entity95 club other than @entity74 , the proximity of @entity30 may well be his best option			1
and there 's no denying that the 1999 @entity14 winner is relishing his return to the limelight of @entity114 football 's finest competition in the twilight of his career			0
" to be asked to come and play here was obviously an honor and something that i was excited about			0
they have big plans at the club , and rightly so , " said a man who has made six @entity8 appearances , all but two of which have come as a substitute			2
@entity5 becomes new face of @entity61 football " @entity30 is an amazing city , amazing culture			1
the club has not been around for many years , and the success that they want to achieve is doable			0
" founded in 1970 , @entity8 faces one of the biggest nights in its history when hosting four - time @entity114 champions @entity16 , who last won the @entity14 in 2011 , on tuesday			1
with @entity137 continually making his case to be regarded as the greatest player in history and coach @entity139 having returned after cancer treatment in @entity143 , knocking @entity16 out of the @entity14 would be one of the biggest achievements for a club that has never been crowned the kings of @entity114			1
" without doubt , they are one of the best teams ever , " said @entity5 , who played for @entity16 's great rivals @entity75 between 2003 and 2007			1
" they 've got some of the best players individually and collectively , and i think that 's what makes them the team they are			0
it 's not about just @entity137 or @entity159 ; they have a unit that works together so well			2
that 's why they 've been successful over the years			0
" they 've got the best player in the world in their team ( @entity137 ) , they 've got committed players , and that 's what makes them a special team			2
" it 's a huge test for us , a huge game for this club and for this city			0
" to date , the most important @entity114 trophy claimed by @entity8 is the now - defunct @entity179 , which the @entity180 lifted in 1996 , but the club 's @entity182 owners , who have spent heavily on @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 to name but a few , are hoping their massive injections of cash can change all that			2
" being part of a club that is looking to the future and looking to become a bigger success than they have in the last few years -- i wanted to be part of that , " said @entity5 of his decision to join @entity8 , which has two solitary league titles ( 1986 , 1994 )			1
and a man who has played at three @entity205 for @entity18 has not ruled out adding to his 115 caps , a tally no other outfield player in the long history of the 1966 world champions can beat			1
" one of the reasons why i 've never retired from the @entity18 team is because if there 's ever an opportunity to play for them again , then i 'm available , " he said			0
" if there is any chance of me ever playing for my country again , i would never turn that down			0
" i 'm almost 38 years old , so the chances are very slight , but you never know , " said a man approaching middle age but whose childhood dreams remain strong .			0
