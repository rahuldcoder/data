attackers defeated in mall siege , @entity13 's president says @entity40 on thursday issued a red notice -- an international wanted alert -- for @entity0 at @entity13 's request			1

authorities have yet to catch up to her			0
@entity13 authorities also suspect @entity0 of hatching a plot to break fellow @entity103 @entity102 out of jail after he was arrested in connection with the alleged @entity76 plot			1
' an innocent young person ' but in the @entity62 town of @entity109 , in @entity61 , where @entity0 lived with @entity65 for a time , she is remembered by local councilor @entity111 as a good , helpful woman			1
" she was an innocent young person , " said @entity111 , who said he knew @entity0 as a " family friend " before the july 2005 bombings			1

she was a very good human being			0
she did everything to help others			0
" he warned against judging her based on rumors and speculation			0
" i 'm worried that the picture that has been demonizing her may be premature because it has not been substantiated , " he said			0
" unless there is hard evidence , we should not just unnecessarily jump to conclusions			0
" @entity0 also reportedly spent time in @entity131 , in @entity132 , where her grandmother , @entity133 , still lives			1
a family friend , local councilor @entity134 , said monday that @entity135 was elderly and ill , and had been " in and out of hospital			0
" this speculation about her granddaughter is upsetting , @entity134 said			0
" this is very distressing for all the family , a decent family			0
and it got worse with the news ( from @entity13 )			0
it 's also very distressing for the people of @entity131 , on behalf of the family , " she said			0
according to the @entity148 , @entity0 's father was a @entity1 soldier posted to the area who married a local woman			1
' very unusual ' @entity13 officials have given differing accounts of the involvement of a white woman in the @entity157 attack			2
senior @entity13 intelligence officials told @entity94 that surveillance video from inside the mall appeared to show such a woman taking part in the attack			1
analysts believe she is @entity1 , the sources said			0

" she has , i think , done this many times before , " she said of the woman but did not name the suspect			2
@entity13 @entity174 spokesman @entity173 told @entity94 that " multiple witnesses " have said they saw a woman among the attackers			2
" we have also been told that if it is the same woman that they say they saw , that she would have been killed very early on in the attack , " he said			2
but he cautioned , " we do n't know for sure that we had a woman			2
and secondly , because of the bodies trapped under the rubble , we do n't know if she is who everyone says she might be			0
" @entity13 interior minister @entity190 previously told reporters that all the attackers were men			2
some of them apparently had dressed as women , he said			0
but on wednesday , he revisited the speculation that a woman was involved , saying that authorities were " hearing possibilities and information , " including from the public			2
" we want to again request you to allow the forensic experts to determine whether that is true , " he said			0
female involvement in such an attack would be " very unusual , " said @entity94 security analyst @entity206			0
" typically these groups are misogynist , " he said			0
" their view is the woman should be in a home and shrouded in a body veil			0
" @entity214 teens among attackers , @entity13 says			0
