the clock is ticking on an interim nuclear deal with @entity2 , as well as efforts in @entity4 to pass new sanctions for greater leverage in global negotiations on a comprehensive accord			1
sunday 's announcement that a six - month interim agreement formally begins on january 20 means that @entity2 must dismantle or freeze some of its nuclear program and open it to more international inspections in return for limited relief from crippling international sanctions			1
assuming all goes as planned , further negotiations between @entity2 and the @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 will seek a broader agreement intended to prevent @entity25 from developing a nuclear weapon			1
meanwhile , @entity28 members of @entity4 are seeking additional sanctions against @entity2 that would take effect if the talks break down			1
@entity32 considers @entity2 's potential nuclear capability an existential threat , and has made clear it would attack militarily if it believed @entity25 could develop such weapons of mass destruction			1
the question is whether the steps @entity2 is taking under the interim deal will blunt or bolster the congressional push for more sanctions			1
president @entity42 warns that approving new sanctions legislation now would undermine the talks , and he has promised to veto such a measure if it came to his desk			1
" now is not time for new sanctions , " @entity42 told reporters on monday			1
he warned the continuing negotiations with @entity2 would be " difficult " and " challenging , " adding that " ultimately this is how diplomacy should work			2
" a bipartisan proposal that would impose new @entity18 sanctions -- but put off implementing them to allow time for negotiations to continue -- has the support of 59 senators so far , a senior @entity53 aide told @entity60 last week			1
according to the aide , the informal count for the measure introduced by @entity64 sen. @entity63 of @entity65 and @entity66 sen. @entity66 of @entity67 surpasses 75 votes -- more than enough for the @entity64 - led @entity53 to override the promised presidential veto			0
it takes a two - thirds majority of both the @entity72 and @entity53 to approve a law over a president 's objection			0
the @entity66 - led @entity72 would have a much easier time of reaching that threshold			0
the @entity42 administration argues the six - month interim deal includes sufficient safeguards in the form of new compliance verification by the @entity84 nuclear energy watchdog -- the @entity85 -- to make further sanctions unnecessary at this time			1
secretary of state @entity87 said sunday that beginning the interim agreement on january 20 means that " for the first time in almost a decade , @entity2 's nuclear program will not be able to advance and parts of it will be rolled back			1
" @entity2 officials also confirmed the start date , state media reported			0
as part of the accord , @entity2 has agreed to start eliminating its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium , to dismantle some infrastructure that makes higher - level uranium enrichment possible , and not to start up additional centrifuges			0
representatives of the @entity85 also will monitor @entity2 's nuclear facilities and make sure the country is taking the required steps as part of the deal			1
in exchange , @entity2 will get sanctions relief over the six - month period of the interim deal totaling about $ 7 billion , including access to $ 4.2 billion in frozen assets			1
the state - run @entity115 reported monday that the first @entity85 envoys to visit @entity25 under the interim agreement would arrive on january 18 , according to a spokesman for the @entity120			0
@entity2 lawmakers have threatened to boost uranium enrichment levels if the @entity18 imposes more sanctions			2
a deputy foreign minister , @entity124 , told @entity60 on sunday that the enactment of additional sanctions from the @entity53 would " ruin the entire agreement			0
" it was not immediately clear if @entity124 's use of the word " enactment " meant that new sanctions would have to become law or merely receive @entity53 approval			0
there was immediate political fallout from the announcement that the interim deal was to take effect			0
" i 'm concerned that this agreement takes us down that path where sanctions pressure is relieved , but @entity2 maintains its ability to produce a nuclear weapon , " said @entity66 rep. @entity66 of @entity140 , who chairs the @entity141			2
" given these stakes , it 's regrettable that the president does not want to work with @entity4 to bolster his negotiating hand with additional sanctions , which would go into effect should @entity2 fail to meet its commitments			1
" however , @entity64 rep. @entity155 of @entity156 argued monday that the talks must be allowed to continue			0
" war is the true alternative offered by those here who would interfere or limit these negotiations , " @entity155 said of supporters for new sanctions			0
" the @entity2 are well aware that this @entity4 can act almost instantly to add even more stringent sanctions if they waver from diplomacy , " he said			1
@entity72 spokesman @entity166 told reporters on monday that @entity2 's willingness to proceed with the interim agreement and its more stringent verification and controls showed the diplomatic pressure was working			0
" the fact that we are now at the implementation stage of the @entity176 demonstrates that , at the very least , testing whether or not @entity2 is serious is the right thing to do , " @entity166 said			0
a senior administration official warned sunday that a new sanctions bill now would derail the current talks and could " undermine the sanctions regime that we have built so meticulously over the course of the last several years			0
" " if the talks are derailed by new @entity18 unilateral sanctions , @entity2 would take that case to the international community and seek to create divisions in the international community , " the official said on condition of not being identified			2
the interim agreement struck in november was considered a successful first step to prevent a possible conflict over @entity2 's nuclear ambitions			2
after it was announced last year , three more rounds of meetings were required to hammer out details for implementing it , @entity196 high representative @entity195 said in a statement on sunday			0
another @entity2 deputy foreign minister , @entity204 , said sunday that his country would stop 20 % uranium enrichment at that time , @entity2 's state - run news agency reported			2
" there 's $ 4.2 billion of @entity2 's oil income which will be released and from the other side , the conversion of 20 % enriched material to oxide or diluting it ( will ) be carried out , " @entity204 said			2
@entity87 warned the upcoming negotiations on a final deal would be " very difficult , but they are the best chance we have to be able to resolve this critical national security issue peacefully and durably			0
