-- @entity1 was only just beginning to win over @entity3 's supporters -- now he 'll have to do it all over again			2
the @entity5 , who replaced @entity6 as interim manager at @entity8 in november , could only look on in horror as his side suffered a humiliating home defeat by @entity12			1
it will do little for @entity1 's popularity with many @entity3 supporters still angry at the removal of @entity6 and the arrival of the former @entity19 manager			1
" a lot of things went wrong today , " @entity1 told reporters			0
" we knew we were playing against the bottom of the table side and we spoke about that			2
" we knew we had to be focused but we did not have the tempo and some players may have been tired			0
" it was going wrong against a side who played deep and were organized			0
" this was supposed to be a routine victory for @entity3 against a @entity12 side which had managed just one league victory all season			1
@entity36 returns to @entity38 management with @entity12 job bottom of the table and favorite for relegation , @entity36 's side faced its west @entity46 rival as huge underdog			1
after all , last season 's @entity49 winners had won their four previous league games , including an impressive 2 - 1 triumph at @entity53 last sunday			1
even with @entity1 's decision to rest the likes of @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 , @entity3 was expected to see off a @entity12 side which had already lost 12 of its 20 league games			1
not since 1979 had @entity12 won in the top - flight at @entity8 and few gave them a chance of claiming a first away success of the league campaign on this occasion			2
after conceding three goals against @entity19 during an embarrassing first half performance on sunday , there was a more resilient look to this @entity12 side			1
the home side were fortunate not to be reduced to ten men on four minutes when @entity74 threw himself into a wild and dangerous challenge on @entity76			0
the @entity78 winger was shown only a yellow card for the tackle , which could easily have resulted in a straight red			0
while @entity3 had plenty of possession and worked goalkeeper @entity85 on a couple of occasions , the home side was unable to muster that moment of magic to claim the lead			2
lampard double inspires @entity3 @entity91 thought he had put his side ahead on 66 minutes only for his effort to be ruled out for offside			2
@entity3 's failure to turn possession into goals allowed their opponent to grow in confidence			0
suddenly , @entity12 began to look dangerous on the counter-attack , soaking up pressure before pushing forward in search of an unlikely winner			0
that winner did eventually come with 12 minutes remaining and when it arrived , it was provided by a man who used to wear the @entity3 blue			0
@entity106 , who spent three years with the club between 2005 - 2008 , showed his former employers how to finish , slamming home from 20 - yards to send shockwaves around @entity8			1
the result leaves @entity12 five points adrift of safety with league games against @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 to come this month			0
quite what @entity3 's prospective signing @entity119 thought of the team 's performance is unknown , but with the @entity124 striker sat in the stands , the @entity126 flattered to deceive			1
while @entity119 was busy watching @entity3 , @entity124 was suffering a 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity53			1
@entity128 had given @entity124 a second minute lead before @entity131 ' stunning free - kick and @entity133 's strike won it for @entity53			1
@entity135 ' side are now just two points behind fourth place @entity3 , while @entity124 sits two points above the relegation zone			2
@entity3 striker @entity140 joins @entity19 elsewhere , @entity19 cruised to a 3 - 0 win over @entity142 thanks to two goals from @entity144			1
the @entity146 international took his tally to 15 @entity38 goals for the season with @entity150 having opened the scoring on 19 minutes			0
@entity19 , which completed the $ 19.6 million signing of @entity3 striker @entity140 wednesday , now sits eighth in the table			1
manager @entity155 also confirmed that midfielder @entity156 is holding talks with former club @entity116 after enduring an unsuccessful spell at @entity159			0
he told reporters : " i spoke to @entity156 earlier			0
he is a really good lad and has been brilliant during my time here in terms of as a human being			0
" he is obviously speaking with @entity116 at the moment and if they can get something organised , it will be a terrific move for @entity156			0
