-- palm oil plantations have a pretty bad reputation among eco warriors			1
often the rows of oil palms replace primary rainforest , after it 's been mercilessly cleared by logging companies , sometimes illegally			2
but now the growing pressure from consumers and environmental groups has started to result in changes on the plantations			2
the owners are not ripping up the multi-million dollar farms , but some are at least making a nod towards a more sustainable way of growing palm oil			1
the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) is a recent initiative to give the industry a better reputation , and brings together representatives from the entire supply chain of palm oil , from the producers and the banks that finance them , to the retailers , and even the consumers			1
to become certified , plantations must adopt a raft of one hundred greener measurers , including set aside areas along rivers where jungle can regenerate			2
some plantation managers are taking it further though , planting endangered trees , enriching these buffer zones with species that are fast disappearing elsewhere in @entity40			1
the planting will never replace the tens of thousands of hectares of lost jungle , but it is a significant departure from past attitudes			0
@entity45 is one of the last @entity47 planters left in the @entity49 palm oil industry			1
he talks like an evangelical environmentalist , which belies his background as a plantation manager for more than a quarter of a century , in both @entity40 and @entity54			1
he grew up in @entity49 after his parents arrived from @entity56 in the mid 1950s when his father took up a plantation engineer 's job , and is passionate about his work			1
but what inspires him even more is the chance , as he sees it , to leave a legacy of environmental creation			0
@entity45 manages a 10,000 hectare estate , formerly a sugar plantation , know as " @entity67 " for @entity68 ( @entity69 ) , about three hours north of the capital , @entity71			2
@entity69 is @entity72 - controlled and in 2008 was the first plantation company in the world to become certified by the @entity19			0
@entity45 thinks despite the terrible reputation the industry has earned , it is possible to take some small steps to start making palm oil more sustainable			1
" we 've got to start somewhere , we can turn the clock back there 's no doubt about it			0
and we as a group are committed to do that and so are some other big plantation players in the country , " says @entity45			2
" we 'll be looking at getting 300 to 500 diverse tree species and i expect we will plant something like 20,000 trees in our gene bank area , from the current 7,500 already planted since the past two and a half years			2
" he 's consulted a local " tree guru " @entity95 on most of the plantings			0
@entity95 is also a former planter , but now runs a rare tree nursery comprising 3 million seedlings of rare and endangered trees			1
" i am one of the guilty ones , the very guilty ones , where we have felled thousands of acres when i was with a big company in @entity104 [ to make way for palm oil trees ] , " says @entity95			1
" so i wanted to start something different , something for the future			0
back then no one was talking about climate change , it really started as a hobby			0
" but now his hobby could be vital to stop some of these trees becoming extinct			0
@entity95 is also being courted by the biggest publicly listed plantation conglomerate in the world , @entity115			0
@entity95 says this giant company , with more than half a million hectares of plantations , is buying 200,000 seedlings from him each year			0
@entity19 criteria mean plantations have to have 2 to 4 percent of their acreage set aside ; @entity115 is stocking some of these areas with rare trees			1
it may take more than 50 years for the seedlings to reach their maximum height , with some growing to more than 75 meters			0
specimens like the @entity127 are critically - endangered ; there are perhaps just a few hundred left in the wild			0
paradoxically , now they are flourishing in an otherwise ecologically barren setting			0
in terms of processing the palm fruit , measures are being taken towards being a little greener			0
each palm tree produces 12 to 14 bunches of bright red fruit per year , each containing 3000 to 5000 fruits each the size of a walnut			2
approximately 5 liters of palm oil is derived from 20 kilos of fruit			1
on @entity45 's estate of 1.4 million palm oil trees a biogas plant was installed in 2008 , which ferments the waste into methane gas that is used to power all the machinery via the mill 's electrical generators			1
the palm oil industry still has a very long way to go to become green , but @entity45 admits consumer pressure is having a positive effect on plantation companies by making them improve their attitude towards conservation and sustainable practices			1
" we as planters are very well placed to do something constructive			2
let 's face it we need a bit of pressure , we need a bit of direction and weÂ¹re well placed to do something about it now , " he says .			0

plantations in @entity49 are taking steps to make palm oil less *destructive*
planting of rare tree *spieces* on plantations is one method
new criteria means plantations have to 2 to 4 percent of land for native trees
@entity45 , plantation manager , says planters are in good place to be constructive
