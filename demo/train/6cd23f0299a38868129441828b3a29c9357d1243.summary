@entity0 -- never before in @entity3 has it been so fashionable -- and financially smart -- to fly the flag			2
big business has long been aware of the economic benefits the nation 's symbol of unity can bring			2
more than a decade ago @entity10 and @entity11 fought over the use of the country 's colors on their livery			2
and now small firms are making it big themselves on a seemingly insatiable demand for all things emblazoned with the @entity20			1
first flown in 1606 , to mark @entity23 's union of @entity24 with @entity25 and @entity26 , the asymmetrical banner is technically called the " @entity29 " when flown on land , though most know it best by its seafaring name the " @entity20			1
" no royalties , but royal riches the flag has been present in its current form since 1801 , when the @entity34 was added to the original design in recognition of the @entity37 with @entity38			1
and because the flag is n't licensed , anyone can print their own patriotic paraphernalia without having to pay any royalties			1
the recent flurry of royal events -- from prince @entity47 's wedding to @entity48 last year to the @entity49 this weekend -- has helped @entity50 regain a love for their national emblem			1
with the @entity53 also in the mix , the " jubilympics " has amplified a sustained appetite for @entity56			0
fashions and treats fit for a queen socks and slippers ... ties and tea cosies the red , white and blue standard adorns a myriad of products			0
it can be found on socks and shoes , ties and teapots -- at both ends of the price spectrum			0
that 's welcome news to traders in a country contending with its first double dip recession since the 1970s -- which was , coincidentally , when the @entity60 celebrated her @entity81			0
but @entity3 's famous flag has had a chequered past , and was n't always so coveted			1
once seen as a stuffy symbol of @entity87 nostalgia , it was hijacked by the far - right , leading to false accusations of nationalism for purveyors of @entity20 products			1
@entity92 founded @entity94 - based @entity93 to be @entity50 in 1997 , and says customers initially assumed he was affiliated with the far - right @entity96 ( @entity96 )			1
turn the clocks to 2012 and business is booming			1
" what can i say ? it 's party time and we are run off our feet , " he told @entity1			0
@entity92 says orders are " three to four times ' " higher now than during the @entity106			0
he 's already out of stock on the most popular goods			0
" we 've sold out of bunting and paper napkins , even the paper plates			0
" he adds : " people keep calling up and asking for them though			0
" while most companies are cutting staff , @entity92 plans to recruit a full - time tech specialist to help with the pick up in traffic on his websites , including www.unionjack.co.uk			0
@entity121 overlooking @entity0 's iconic @entity123 , the souvenir shop @entity121 takes its name from former @entity50 prime minister @entity126 's 1997 national rebranding exercise			1
as you would imagine , its shelves are brimming with @entity50 bargains			1
@entity131 , @entity121 's @entity20 - dressed mascot , says sales are up at least 20 % on last year , across the chain 's three @entity135 stores			1
" the most popular items are the mugs , pens , key rings			0
they just ca n't seem to get enough of them , " he says			2
@entity131 also describes sales as " much busier " than during the @entity106			0
but you do n't have to come from the @entity50 to want a piece of the @entity20			1
@entity3 's continental cousins may have flown the flag upside down on the day the country joined the @entity151 but now they wear it the right way up with pride			2
peering up at 147 , 12 foot - high flags adorning @entity0 's shopping district , @entity155 shows off her new @entity20 top to classmates on a school trip from @entity161			1
" look it matches ! " she says			0
@entity155 says she likes wearing the @entity20 " because it 's cool , because this country is cool ! " she continues : " i do n't care if it 's not my flag			1
" not made in @entity3 @entity169 , professor of @entity25 at @entity170 is something of an expert on the symbolism behind @entity3 's gonfalon			0
and having just released an authoritative biography of the @entity20 , one would imagine @entity169 is set to make a pretty penny himself			1
" @entity177 is so ubiquitous now it 's almost invisible , " he says			0
" personally , i 've been struck by the recent enthusiasm for it			2
it has far outstripped what i could have expected			0
" @entity169 adds : " i bet half of the people buying @entity56 do n't really know the full history and what it means			2
" @entity92 points out another irony			0
" yes they represent the best of @entity50 and they are selling like crazy here , " he says			1
" but i 'd bet most of the flags on the market are n't made here ... i hear 99 % of them come from @entity193			2
" @entity194 in @entity0 contributed to this article			0
