it could be out with old meeting rooms and in with new social spaces , as @entity3 is set to transform the way we work in the next 10 years			1
in the @entity7 , those born between 1979 and 1997 are predicted to make up the largest part of the workforce within a decade and with it change offices and the nature of work itself			1
" we are facing a huge generational shift , as baby boomers ( born between 1946 and 1964 ) leave the workforce , and that means we have to rethink our workspace , " says @entity14 , senior director of workplace research for @entity16 by the end of the decade , the balance in the @entity7 will flip from approximately 50 % baby boomers and 25 % generation y workers to 25 % baby boomers and 50 % generation y workers , according to a 2010 report from @entity16 , a workplace furnishing company			1
" that is a massive shift , and it will happen in less than eight years , " says @entity14			2
to understand how workspaces will need to change to accommodate and attract this new generation of workers , @entity14 and @entity16 looked at the work patterns and preferences of more than 15,000 employees in 40 countries , and across four generations			1
their findings reveal a number of generational differences			0
for example , @entity3 rates the importance of having an " engaging workplace " highest and the " quality of meeting rooms " lowest , while baby boomers rate these features opposite , with high importance on meeting rooms			1
" baby boomers like structured , face - to - face meetings , " says @entity14			1
that 's how they usually get things done			0
and if that 's how you get things done , the quality of meeting spaces will be important to you			0
" generation y on the other hand , likes quick , casual and socially - tinged meetings			0
their use of technology in interaction further undermines the importance of lengthy meetings and formal spaces , according to @entity14			0
as for their top priority on an engaging workspace , @entity3 blends their personal and private life , and they like a workplace to feel residential and like home , says @entity14 , explaining that baby boomers do n't expect or want spaces that evoke the emotional connectedness of home			1
" they tend to separate their work life and their personal life , " he says , adding that their focus is more on function and on efficient spaces			1
so how will this play out in the office of the future ? " it already does , " says @entity90 , co-author of " future work : how business can adapt and thrive in the new world of work "			1
" it is the idea of work being an activity and not a place			2
that is more important , " she says , " and it is already happening in companies like @entity104 's @entity103 office and @entity106 's office in @entity107			0
" the focus there is on collaboration and innovation , nobody has a permanent desk , and employees are encouraged to move around and work in a space that best suit their activity at any given time			2
" however , she emphasizes that the generational shift is just one of many variables pushing us into a new world of work			2
changes in technology , the economy and businesses are all part of the shift			0

" now , designers are building a wider variety of rooms tailored to each company 's function and direction			0
you are seeing more open meeting spaces , lounge furniture near circulation spaces and that type of thing			0
it is a shift from a ' me ' to a ' we ' workspace			0
" however , tearing down all these walls can be a challenge to baby boomers			1
" it hurts when you take the office away , " says @entity14 , " because you feel like you have worked your whole career , and you 've earned that			0
to baby boomers , the office is a status marker			1
to @entity3 , a status symbol is more likely to be whether or not it has the new @entity163 or a certain level of freedom			1
" @entity166 ( those born between 1965 and 1978 ) is a group that grew up with financial and work insecurity and has little in common with @entity3 or baby boomers , believes @entity14			1
" they tend to be more skeptical			0
their focus is on security ; they are more the ' show me the money ' generation , " he says			0
are cool offices the key to success ? so , how does a company maneuver this field of different generations and preferences ? " be aware of your workforce and your employees ' needs and wants , " says @entity183 , senior director of research at @entity185 , a non-profit organization that works to expand business opportunities for women			1
" assess the specific group because there is so much variation			2
that is a way to start creating a workforce that is inclusive			2
" @entity199 agrees : " companies that are going to have three or four generations in their workplace really do need to think about those different work styles and different preferences			2
falling over to accommodate only generation y would not be the most productive way and could backfire			0
