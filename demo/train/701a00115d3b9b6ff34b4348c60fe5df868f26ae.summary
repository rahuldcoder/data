-- the martin luther king , jr. day of service is inspiring people across the country to volunteer this holiday weekend			0
but if you 're itching to do more -- perhaps turning your next family vacation into a series of teachable moments about the importance of giving back -- there are plenty of opportunities to make that happen			2
more than @entity13 a trip to @entity15 can easily involve service			1
just 20 minutes from @entity17 is a theme park called @entity19			0
its 70 - acre grounds host 7,000 children with life - threatening illnesses every year			1
" we partner with more than 250 wish - granting organizations around the world to help fulfill a child 's one wish to visit the beloved theme parks of @entity32 , " says @entity24 , a spokeswoman			1
" if a child 's wish is to swim with the dolphins , we are the destination			2
if a child 's wish is to get a hug from @entity39 , we help make that happen			2
" the resort relies heavily on volunteers			0
since its founding in 1986 , more than 50,000 volunteer " angels " have been put to work			0
children as young as 12 can help out by scooping ice cream and serving meals , and children who love performing can even be part of the evening entertainment			2
the minimum commitment is one three - hour shift			2
sweat - soaked volunteering if your family wants a physically demanding volunteer vacation , the @entity55 and local trails organizations offer unique , sweat - soaked opportunities			1
for as little as $ 400 , a family of four can spend four to five days with the @entity63 -- meals , lodging ( usually tents ) , transportation and equipment included			0
you 'll be doing much - needed trail maintenance , and reconstruction projects and your kids will be taught outdoor survival skills			1
but hikers beware : " while we know children have a lot of fun on these trips and they are exposed to an incredible experience , it can certainly be challenging , " warns @entity80 , the club 's director of north country operations			1
the club does n't have age restrictions , but parents are urged to use their best judgment regarding their child 's interest and physical ability			2
trips are offered june through october			0
@entity91 : we can make a difference good works and decent lodging the @entity55 offers volunteer trips year - round at some of the country 's top tourist destinations			1
at @entity101 and @entity102 in @entity103 , parents and children can assist in removing unwanted vegetation , while in @entity108 , @entity109 , families can help protect endangered @entity111 salmon and @entity112			1
all meals and equipment are included , but the fee for joining is significantly higher			0
helping out next october along the @entity116 , especially meaningful after @entity118 's devastation , will cost $ 595 per person			2
but if you 're looking to spend a week away from home -- doing good and staying in hotel - style lodging -- this trip may still be a bargain			1
@entity126 , co-host of the nationally syndicated radio program " @entity130 " and speaker at this year 's @entity129 , says volunteer vacations offer children what they often do n't get enough of in school			1
" as volunteers , children can get down on the ground , " says @entity126 , who recommends @entity136 trips			2
" they can get dirty			0
unlike any other kind of travel , kids will get to better understand different people and their communities and their problems			1
" hiking to help others trekking for kids merges one - of - a - kind hiking expeditions to places such as @entity150 in @entity151 and @entity152 in @entity153 with the ability to help orphans in those communities			1
" children are increasingly living a multicultural global existence , " says @entity157 , executive director of the nonprofit travel group			1
" by being intimately involved in these service projects , they learn they can contribute to the greater good and make a difference			0
our trips teach kids this lesson from the moment they sign up			0
" that 's because @entity170 does n't let parents just write a check and have their kids show up			1
each participant pays his or her own expenses and commits to raising $ 1,000			0
children have raised money by holding bake sales , asking family and friends for donations and conducting tag sales			1
" we think this increases a child 's personal stake in the trip			0
kids become more passionate , " @entity157 says			0
all money raised is poured into the orphanage the family will eventually visit , she says			1
as you plan your family 's volunteer vacation , @entity126 suggests keeping the following in mind : how long has the organization been in business ? do volunteers come back ? ask to speak with past volunteers ; they are likely to be candid about their experiences			0
no matter which organization you partner with , @entity157 says your child will likely learn an invaluable lesson			0
" they 'll understand the world is not just about them			1
it 's about how others struggle to live and what we can do to help			0
i think that 's the kind of world @entity219 wanted			2
" a life celebrated through service @entity222 writes about parenting for @entity224			0
she is the author of " @entity225 , " " always too soon " and " covering catastrophe			0
