opened in november with a towering ambition -- become what the @entity5 is to @entity7 and the @entity8 is to @entity9			1
the museum could n't be in a better location to attract attention -- it sits just across the street from @entity14 , @entity16 's main royal palace , and adjacent to a neighborhood that 's one of @entity16 's most popular among tourists			1
other than @entity20 , @entity21 , a private art museum owned by @entity21 , @entity16 has no other large museum housing @entity25 contemporary art. all of these factors have added up to put not just the art , but the new museum itself , under intense public scrutiny			2
" there 's an incredible anticipation from the art world here about which works will be shown and how the space will be used , " says @entity31 , a museum curator in @entity16			1
with @entity2 anxious to maintain its world - class standing amid surging development in @entity42 and other regional rivals , the pressure for global recognition is particularly intense			1
" as @entity2 's only national art museum , one of our biggest missions is to showcase @entity25 art to the rest of the world , and to advance @entity25 art via various collaborations and exchanges with international institutions , " says @entity44 - in @entity45 , the museum 's international affairs manager			1
early controversy one of the museum 's first five showcase exhibits , @entity61 ( showing through april 27 ) , drew early fire from critics of the museum			1
the problem was n't the art itself -- the exhibit showcases modern @entity25 art , with 59 works by 39 @entity25 artists -- but the way it was selected			1
the @entity73 and other artist groups alleged favoritism -- 32 of the 39 featured artists are alums of @entity79 's art school , from which the exhibition 's curator and @entity3 director @entity80 graduated			1
@entity80 withstood calls for her resignation , but , coming shortly after the museum 's official opening , the protests marred what museum supporters intended to be a grand celebration			1
a close eye apart from a few projects sponsored by companies , including @entity96 and @entity97 , the @entity3 is funded mostly by the national government -- yet another reason for the intense scrutiny it 's received since its very conception			2
though some argue the museum has helped revitalize the neighborhood , proposals were met with numerous building restrictions , as well as protests against changes in the historic neighborhood			2
since its opening , the reception from residents has been mostly positive			0
more than 160,000 people have visited the museum since the mid-november opening , and nearby cafes and stores teem with customers			1
" it feels like there 's a new cafe or restaurant or exhibit opening here all the time now , " says @entity45 , 54 , an art collector who 's lived in the area for more than 30 years			1
" the downside is , of course , the traffic			0
" it 's difficult to believe @entity16 has n't been home to a national contemporary art museum for nearly 30 years			2
in 1986 , the original art museum moved from a small @entity16 building to a bigger space in @entity135 , about 10 miles south , during the @entity136 -- it 's taken nearly three decades to move back to @entity16			2
the primary catalyst for the new museum was former president @entity140			0
during his administration in early 2009 , @entity45 announced the transformation of a former military site into a place where the future of @entity16 culture could be celebrated			0
big ambitions @entity3 leaders hope to harness the star power of internationally acclaimed @entity25 artists to help thrust the museum into the global spotlight			1
" if the museum can utilize the international attention that comes in these beginning stages , the pressure of the spotlight could be a major driving force , " said @entity153 , editor of magazines art in @entity155 in @entity156			0
this is one of the reasons a work by @entity165 , perhaps the most critically acclaimed living @entity25 artist , was chosen as the museum 's central showpiece			1
@entity165 's 12 - meter - high " @entity170 " is housed in a 17 - meter - high space called the @entity169			2
transparent fabric has been shaped to resemble @entity165 's first @entity173 home in @entity174 , while the traditional @entity25 building ( hanok ) inside represents his childhood home			0
" a vital institutional mission is to function as a connecting bridge between the domestic and beyond -- we will put our best effort to introduce @entity25 art to the world outside and vice versa , " @entity3 director @entity80 said in a local interview			0
with no permanent collection , the museum is under pressure to deliver more than any other @entity25 contemporary art museum has ever before provided the city			0
" in terms of scale , we are in line with with the @entity5 and the @entity8 , " says @entity192 of the @entity193			0
" we have also signed an exhibition contract with the @entity8 and will continue planning exhibits in the context of the global art scene			0
" new space architect @entity203 took an open approach to the new museum building , which spans 27,264 square meters over six floors ( three above ground , three below ) , using skylights and expansive windows			0
" when you walk in , the first floor is meant to be a comfortable public space , " says @entity192			0
" once you 're inside , you can go down to @entity214 and enjoy the exhibitions			0
" the museum opened with five inaugural exhibitions : the @entity218 ; connecting_unfolding ; @entity61 ; birth of a museum ; and the @entity221			2
@entity165 's " @entity228 " is the most visible , though the most popular exhibition to date has been @entity223 , which combines science , art and architecture to create a decidedly technical experience			0
overall , the museum has a 60:40 ratio of @entity25 art to international art. it remains to be seen whether the museum 's presence , or the exhibitions it brings in , will live up to the massive hype and expectations that have surrounded its opening			1
one thing is sure -- @entity241 and art communities around the world will be paying attention to see if it does			0
