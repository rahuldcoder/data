-- an interview with a choreographer for the @entity4 pageant spurred controversy wednesday over alleged claims that @entity7 personally selects some of the finalists			1
@entity7 is at the center of a brewing controversy over the @entity4 finalists			1
the q&a with @entity13 , which appeared on @entity14 , quotes him as saying that " it 's just kind of common knowledge that [ @entity7 ] picks six of the top 15 single - handedly			1
" " and , his reason for doing so , as he told me and he 's told the girls before , is that he left it all up to preliminary judging in the past , and some of the most beautiful women , in his opinion , were not in the top 15 , and he was kind of upset about that , " the story quotes @entity13 as saying			1
" and he decided that he would pick a certain number and let the judges pick a certain number			0
" via e-mail , @entity13 said that he " was speaking in hypothetical jest " when he said @entity7 picks some of the finalists and said the mogul has never spoken to either him , or any of his team , about the selection process			1
" the story posted on that site contains many misquotes and [ is ] highly inaccurate , " @entity13 wrote			1
" i would like to disassociate myself from it completely and anything negative in regards to @entity4 or even suggesting that @entity7 ' rigs ' his event			1
i 'm perplexed as to why @entity14 would run a story such as this when they are aware that it is inaccurate			0
" @entity47 , publisher of @entity49 , said his site stands by the story , which resulted after @entity13 was contacted about his role choreographing both the pageant and a much talked - about performance by reality - star - turned - singer @entity54			2
" whatever you see quoted in the article is verbatim what he said , " @entity55 said			0
" so i can understand why he would want to retract those words , but unfortunately that was what was said			0
" a statement from @entity65 president @entity66 , released wednesday , said that " to suggest the pageant is somehow orchestrated or ' rigged ' is utterly false and misleading			1
" however , the statement also observed that @entity7 does play a role in selecting the finalists			0
" in the 2009 @entity4 competition , a preliminary panel of judges selected nine of the @entity74 and members of the @entity65 , including owner @entity7 , selected the remaining six , " the statement began			2
the statement went on to say that " a separate panel of judges , introduced live at the @entity79 telecast , is solely responsible for the selection of the @entity81 , @entity82 and the ultimate winner of the pageant			0
" " this system has been in place since 2005 and has always been fully disclosed to the contestants , their directors , the judges and the viewing audience , " the statement said			0
" the procedure is overseen by the accounting firm of @entity93 and @entity94			0
to in any way call into question the integrity of the judging process or suggest the pageant is somehow orchestrated or ' rigged ' is utterly false and misleading			2
" @entity55 describes @entity100 as an " entertainment web site for the @entity103 community that covers the interests and portrayals of acculturated @entity103 in this country			0
" the @entity4 pageant is very popular in the @entity103 community , @entity55 said , and the story took a different turn after the alleged comments were published			2
@entity13 , who has choreographed the pageant for the past few years , said in an e-mail to @entity0 that although @entity7 does meet with the contestants before the televised pageant , as far as he knows , it is just a gesture on @entity7 's part in his role as producer of the pageant			1
" i know the @entity65 goes to great lengths to establish a preliminary and final panel of judges as well as different factors on which contestants are judged , " @entity13 wrote			2
" however , i 'm the last person to be quoted as saying anything in regard to the judging or selecting process , i 'm the choreographer , i deal with that			0
