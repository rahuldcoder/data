-- the increasingly convoluted scandal that led to the resignation of cia director @entity3 has become an endless source of speculation , drama and surprising turns of events			2
there is much we do n't know , but a few important facts have emerged with sharp clarity			0
it 's not too early to learn the first few lessons from this continuing saga , which promises to deliver many more for weeks , probably months			2
here is some of what we have learned -- and relearned -- so far : 1			2
powerful men , no matter how brilliant and accomplished , can suffer from a form of temporary insanity caused by the interaction of arrogance and libido			1
sadly , this is a lesson we see repeated time and time again , across national borders , destroying promising careers and even changing the course of history			0
nothing , it seems , not even the highest iqs , the most exclusive security clearances , or the tangible risk of losing it all for the sake of a tryst will stop certain men from pursuing an illicit relationship			2
yes , powerful women do it too , but the cases are rare			0
on the other hand , the parade of men who have destroyed or very nearly killed their careers and their personal lives is endless			2
news : the @entity3 scandal -- what we know so far @entity3 , the most celebrated military officer of his generation , is the most recent addition to the list			2
we still do n't know what 's behind tens of thousands of pages of e-mails gen. @entity60 allegedly exchanged with a woman involved in the @entity3 scandal , and there 's the curious case of the @entity65 agent who reportedly sent shirtless pictures of himself to that same woman			1
we ca n't say yet which of these characters will join the melancholy list that includes @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , and on and on and on , each with an accompanying cast of heartbroken relatives			0
( and , by the way , when a powerful man pays a high price for his indiscretions , prepare to see efforts to blame it all on the woman			0
it 's not surprising that the @entity3 case has included countless references to the clothing choices of the general 's girlfriend , as if form - fitting outfits made it all seem logical and understandable			2
anything you write in an e-mail can be used against you			1
nothing is private , especially not when it goes through @entity101 ( @entity100 's ) hands			1
if @entity105 's top spy , the head of the @entity106 , can get caught writing secret love letters to his girlfriend on @entity100 , nobody 's e-mails are safe			1
@entity3 and his clandestine girlfriend , @entity109 , took some troubles to keep their illicit correspondence safe			0
they reportedly relied on a trick used by some @entity115 operatives			0
they left messages to each other in the drafts folder of an account , the password to which they both knew , thinking they would remain for their eyes only			0
but it did n't work			0
when the @entity65 came calling , @entity101 opened up its shockingly large files , as it does with shocking regularity			1
@entity101 knows everything about you , and it frequently shares with those who ask			0
@entity101 's own reports say it passed information to authorities in response to 93 percent of government requests in the second half of 2011			2
nothing in @entity101 's hands is guaranteed to remain private			1
the @entity65 can investigate practically anyone in the @entity105 , even the director of @entity139			1
that 's a stunning notion to contemplate , and it says both good and bad things about @entity105			1
first the good : no one is above reproach , not even a man whose power is vast and often elaborately concealed			0
in fact , if you ask the world 's great conspiracy theorists , they will tell you the @entity106 can do anything , anywhere , at any time			0
but its boss got found out by his own country 's law enforcement gumshoes			0
score a point for the rule of law in @entity105 , but subtract one for privacy and another for the randomness of @entity65 work			1
it seems rather strange that the @entity65 decided to pursue a case of harassing e-mails			1
i was once personally told by an @entity65 agent , in no uncertain terms , that the @entity65 had no time to spend on threats sent over the @entity171 , even if the messages included a threat to kill			1
news : is @entity3 pillow talk a security threat ? 4			0
@entity105 are deeply torn about the question of private morality and the public sphere			1
there is a nagging sense that the @entity3 case may have cost the @entity105 the service of an uncommonly talented man for no good reason			1
we do n't know all there is to know , and there is a possibility that this is a matter of compromised national security , in which case the invasion of privacy , the destruction of personal lives , and the painful intrusion into the deepest emotional recesses of several families ' worlds , could ultimately prove justified			0
until more is known , the rest of the world is shaking its head at what could be another baffling case of @entity105 puritanism			1
@entity206 : why @entity3 will be missed @entity105 , meanwhile , are already trying to work out whether it makes sense to even consider the sexual lives of public officials			1
there is the none - of - our - business crowd , which i believe is gaining strength , pitted against those who would like to keep aiming for strict ideals of morality , on the argument that personal dishonesty reflects a moral failing that will ultimately takes a toll on the work of a public servant ; that if a man will lie to his wife , he will lie to his country			0
this is a questionable proposition			0
in this case , with @entity3 having achieved such a high level of recognition for his public service , many people seem to almost hope that a genuine national security angle will be found , because it 's too difficult to justify the sacrifice of a talented official , or perhaps more than one , over foolish peccadillos			1
a salacious sex scandal will push everything off the top of the rundown or the front page , especially when the most immediate next challenge is the " fiscal cliff , " a dry and arcane topic that will cause most people to change the channel or turn the page			1
that 's one reason we know this strange and twisting case , already involving such a complicated and unlikely cast of characters , will continue to garner enormous attention for a long , long time			2
the least we can hope is to learn some useful lessons			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity259 .			0

@entity261 : *petraeus* scandal is far from clear , but we *'ve* learned some things anyway
she says libido and arrogance continue to make accomplished men do stupid things
she says anything you write in an e-mail is not really private ; the @entity65 can look if it so chooses
@entity276 : @entity105 torn about what 's public , private ; prefer a sex scandal to real issues
