-- twenty years ago last month , the @entity1 was born			0
the goal of @entity1 was straightforward -- to encourage the free movement of goods and capital between the @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
few points in history have been as important in forging bonds between our three countries			2
while @entity1 is a relatively new pact that ties our nations , there are some things that go back far longer that bind us			0
like the annual monarch butterfly migration , which started long before the trades , borders or foreign affairs were even an issue			2
there 's no record telling us when monarch butterflies first began their journeys of up to 2,800 miles between southern @entity8 , the northern @entity6 , and central @entity7			1
it 's easy to assume that an end date for the migrations is just as elusive , but reality tells a different story			0
in january , we got grim news from the central mountains of @entity7 , the southernmost destination for migrating monarchs and sanctuary for their winter hibernation			1
according to surveys carried out by @entity42 , together with @entity7 's @entity43 on @entity44 and other partners , the entire hibernating population of monarch butterflies in the 2013 - 2014 season occupied an area of forest not much bigger than a football field -- a mere 1.6 acres			1
this is a 44 % drop from the previous season , and a continuation of the freefall migrating monarchs have taken since data collection began two decades ago			0
2013 was the worst year for these butterflies in recorded history			1
now people are talking about the migration disappearing altogether			0
there are several reasons for the decline , including extreme climate events in the @entity6 and @entity8 as well as deforestation in @entity7			1
yet the biggest culprit is likely the widespread extermination of milkweed , a flowering plant critical to monarch butterfly reproduction and development			2
across much of the monarch 's range , particularly in the midwestern @entity6 , milkweed has fallen victim en masse to changing land use and the advent of herbicide - resistant crops			2
in short , the cupboard is bare for monarch caterpillars , and as a result one of @entity82 's most dazzling natural wonders is on the brink of vanishing entirely			1
if you 've been fortunate enough to witness any part of the monarch spectacle , you understand why we ca n't let this happen			0
whether a blanket of orange against a deep blue sky ; a forest draped from root to leaf in dormant monarchs ; or a single butterfly fluttering past you en route to join the masses , there is nothing quite like it			0
the proverbial silver lining to this dark news on migratory monarch numbers is that it may have come at an opportune time			0
next wednesday , february 19 , @entity6 president @entity107 will meet with @entity8 prime minister @entity108 and @entity111 president @entity109 a @entity112 at the @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity7			1
@entity114 is just a short distance from the monarch 's hibernation sites			0
during the summit , the butterflies will still be in nearby forests , poised to emerge from a four - month siesta that began in early winter			1
@entity124 officials have said the three leaders will discuss " a range of issues important to the daily lives of all of @entity82 's people			1
" what is n't clear is whether the plight of the monarchs will make the agenda , and if the three countries bound by an age - old butterfly migration will together show resolve in making sure this unique connection is n't permanently severed			0
whether monarchs flying south from @entity139 , across @entity82 's heartland to converge on the oyamel fir trees of the @entity142 ; gray whales hugging the @entity145 coast as they migrate from @entity146 to the @entity147 and back again ; or pronghorn antelope clinging to strongholds from the @entity150 to the @entity151 , the natural bonds connecting the @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 stretch back millennia and transcend anything that can be traded or written on paper			1
they are bonds to take pride in , that unite the countries of @entity82 in unexpected , beautiful ways			2
something we simply can not let disappear			0
the summit in @entity114 may be the last hope we have of saving the monarch migration			2
president @entity109 a @entity112 himself has been committed to the conservation of the monarch sanctuaries of @entity7 since he served as governor there from 2005 to 2011			1
he knows firsthand the significant efforts and sacrifices of @entity7 's local indigenous communities , authorities and civil society organizations to protect the sanctuaries			2
he also knows the important contribution the butterflies bring to local social and economic well - being			0
only a joint effort from all three countries will turn the tide in favor of the monarch			0
our leaders must re-energize efforts to conserve the monarch butterfly , like those under the @entity187 that was born alongside @entity1			0
this plan must include concrete actions to halt destruction of milkweed in the @entity6 and @entity8 , restore monarch habitat in all three countries , and strengthen law enforcement in @entity7 to stop deforestation			1
if together we could pull off something as big and ambitious as @entity1 , solving the monarch crisis must be within our means			0
we urge our heads - of - state , on behalf of all the people of @entity82 , to use this opportunity to commit to the long - term preservation of one of our most ancient and spectacular bonds			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 and @entity207 .			1

president @entity107 and his *counterparts* from @entity8 and @entity7 will meet at summit
@entity206 , @entity207 : they should discuss plight of monarch butterflies
2013 was the worst year for these butterflies in recorded history , they say
@entity206 , @entity207 : they *'re* a special to @entity82 , we must stop their decline
