-- an appellate court on thursday ordered a new trial for a @entity4 woman who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a gun to scare off her allegedly abusive husband , ruling that a jury was improperly instructed on self - defense			1
@entity11 's case will be retried because the jury was wrongly told that -- for her to claim self - defense -- she needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that her husband was about to seriously harm her , the appellate court said			1
rather , the appellate court pointed out , the prosecution had the burden to prove that @entity18 herself was guilty of aggravated assault			1
" because the jury instructions on self - defense were fundamental error , we reverse " the conviction , a three - judge appellate panel said			1
a jury convicted @entity18 , 31 , of aggravated assault in march 2012 after just 12 minutes of deliberation			1
@entity18 's lawyer said he told her about the new trial by phone			2
" @entity11 was ecstatic and obviously she 's incredibly thankful and wants to get back with her family , " defense attorney @entity32 told @entity0			1
' @entity34 ' denied in @entity18 case the case gained the attention of civil rights leaders , who say the @entity41 - @entity40 mother of three was persecuted because of her race , and from others , including @entity40 rep. @entity44 , who said the sentence was too harsh and @entity18 never should have been charged			0
@entity18 claimed self - defense , saying she was attempting to flee her husband , @entity48 , on august 1 , 2010 , when she picked up a handgun and fired a shot into a wall			1
she said her husband had read cell phone text messages that she had written to her ex-husband , got angry and tried to strangle her			0
state attorney @entity55 had said the case deserved to be prosecuted because @entity18 fired in the direction of a room where two children were standing			1
@entity60 had said she offered @entity18 a plea bargain that would have resulted in a three - year prison sentence , but @entity18 chose to take the case to a jury trial , where a conviction would carry a mandatory sentence under a @entity4 law known as " 10 - 20 - life			2
" the law mandates increased penalties for some felonies , including aggravated assault , in which a gun is carried or used			2
opinion : shame of mandatory minimums during sentencing in may 2012 , a judge said he had no choice but to sentence her to 20 years			0
" under the state 's 10 - 20 - life law , a conviction for aggravated assault where a firearm has been discharged carries a minimum and maximum sentence of 20 years without regarding to any extenuating or mitigating circumstances that may be present , such as those in this case , " judge @entity80 said that year			1
before the trial , @entity18 unsuccessfully tried to use @entity4 's @entity34 to argue she was immune from prosecution			0
to win the immunity hearing , she would have needed to show that she was more likely entitled than not to use force			0
but a judge in the pretrial immunity hearing rejected the request , saying @entity18 's decision to go back into the house was not consistent with someone in fear for her safety			0
in thursday 's decision , the appellate court said @entity18 would not get a new immunity hearing			0
but she can still claim self - defense at trial			2
the office of the @entity4 state attorney for @entity114 said thursday that @entity18 's conviction " was reversed on a legal technicality			0
" " we are gratified that the court affirmed the defendant 's @entity34 ruling " denying pretrial immunity , the office said			0
@entity4 lawmakers wo n't have special session on ' stand your ground ' @entity127 's @entity126 and @entity0 's @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report .			0
