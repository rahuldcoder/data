@entity0 , @entity1 -- eight people were killed and 17 were injured wednesday when an improvised explosive device detonated followed by a suicide bomber 's explosion , according to police and medical officials			1
the attacks targeted people leaving @entity12 mosque after night - time prayers in @entity14 in western @entity0 , according to the sources more than 16 suspects have been arrested by security police , sources told @entity2			2
@entity19 , a predominantly @entity12 neighborhood , is just two miles from @entity21			1
during a televised address earlier wednesday @entity1 prime minister @entity22 declared an amnesty for all @entity26 tribesmen who fought against the government , with the exception of those involved in the killing of @entity1 forces			1
@entity22 also said he hoped that members of @entity1 's parliament would be able to choose a president and prime minister in their next session			1
after much anticipation over how it would address the country 's turmoil , @entity1 's new parliament on tuesday postponed its first session until next week , citing a lack of a quorum			2
the political uncertainty comes as @entity1 forces battle @entity26 extremist militants from the @entity45 in @entity1 and @entity46 , or @entity47			1
" we are going to postpone because of an urgent matter , " the speaker of the parliament said tuesday			0
he did not say what the urgent matter was , and it was not immediately clear what happened			0
the newly elected parliament convened with 255 out of 328 elected officials attending , which was enough for a legal quorum , the speaker said			0
but when 90 failed to return after a morning break , there were not enough members to continue			0
many had expected @entity22 to call for the formation of a new government tuesday , @entity22 and his @entity12 - dominated government have been under pressure from @entity69 and @entity70 diplomats to be more inclusive of members of @entity1 's @entity26 minority , who say they have been marginalized and cut out of the political process by the government			1
when @entity47 fighters swept into northern @entity1 , seizing the city of @entity78 , reports emerged of some @entity26 either joining the militants or doing nothing to fight them			1
under @entity1 's constitution , the parliament has 75 days from when it convenes to pick a prime minister			2
lawmakers are under pressure to move faster , but the political body has had trouble moving swiftly in the past			0
the last time parliament met to pick a prime minister , it took nearly 10 months			0
opinion : will @entity93 fight @entity47 @entity95 state ? more warplanes arrive five more @entity100 - made @entity99 fighter jets have been delivered to @entity1 , the @entity97 said in a statement on tuesday			1
the delivery brought to 10 the number of war planes @entity100 has delivered so far and the ministry said it is expecting a total of 25 under a contract agreed to by @entity108 and @entity0			2
the announcement follows a comment by @entity22 that militant advances might have been avoided if @entity1 had proper air power in the form of fighter jets that @entity1 has been trying to get from the @entity115			1
" i 'll be frank and say that we were deluded when we signed the contract " with the @entity115 , @entity22 told the @entity116 in the interview last week , which was released friday			2
@entity1 has now turned to @entity100 and @entity120 to buy fighter jets , he said			1
" @entity123 willing , within one week , this force will be effective and will destroy the terrorists ' dens , " he said			0
@entity127 annexation condemned in his weekly address , @entity22 said the priority was to improve the security situation in the country , even as the political process moves forward			2
" @entity133 should be the first and foremost on our agendas , " he said			0
he thanked @entity1 's top @entity12 cleric , @entity136 , for his call for volunteers to pick up arms to defend the country against @entity47 and said a new government department would handle their mobilization			1
thousands of people , predominantly @entity143 , have answered the call , raising concerns among @entity26 about the rise of @entity12 militias			0
announcing the amnesty for tribesmen who have not killed @entity1 forces , @entity22 said , " i welcome them back to the fold and to rejoin their brethren in other @entity1 tribes			1
" he also strongly rejected the @entity158 regional government 's effective annexation of the disputed oil - rich city of @entity127 and other areas in northern @entity1 , saying it was unacceptable			2
he called on the @entity158 leaders not to take advantage of the state 's current weakness to advance their own specific agendas			0
any attempt to hold a referendum on the move is invalid because there is no provision in the constitution for self - determination , @entity22 added			2
the prime minister did not say how he planned to address the move			0
@entity158 leader @entity176 announced friday that the disputed areas , including @entity127 , were henceforth part of the @entity158 autonomous region , after the @entity1 central government failed to hold a long - awaited referendum			2
last month , the @entity1 army withdrew from @entity127 and @entity183 forces took control of the city and small villages in the areas as @entity47 carried out its lightning offensive			1
the move by the @entity158 will probably complicate efforts to get @entity1 lawmakers to form a new government representing all three major population groups -- sunnis , @entity143 and @entity158			0
@entity115 : @entity1 military probably would fight for @entity0 emboldened by the weakened @entity1 government 's struggle to mount an effective response to their advance , @entity47 extremists declared over the weekend that they had set up a caliphate -- or @entity95 state -- spanning large areas of @entity1 and @entity46			1
@entity1 military units around @entity0 are likely to stand and fight if @entity47 militants attack the city , preliminary reports from @entity115 military advisers in @entity1 and @entity115 intelligence personnel concluded , according to a senior @entity115 official			1
the @entity115 assessment comes as intelligence also shows that @entity216 @entity215 forces are increasing their efforts to train @entity12 militias in and around @entity0 and in southern @entity1			1
this assessment that @entity1 forces will fight for @entity0 is crucial to the @entity115 need to keep @entity21 secure			1
the official says 300 @entity115 troops there now , along with several @entity224 helicopters , could not on their own secure the airport , crucial if an evacuation was needed , and it would require the @entity1 to devote a large number of their troops to the effort			0
@entity1 's military spokesman , maj. gen. @entity230 , told a news conference in @entity0 on wednesday that the current military situation was going in favor of the country 's security forces			1
