-- " who is the nicest person you 've met in showbiz ? " it 's a question i 'm often asked after nearly 20 years working at @entity4			2
my encounter with @entity8 was relatively brief , but it left a lasting impression of a man who not only contributed a great deal to music , but also conducted himself with a rare professionalism and courtesy			1
the date was september 11 , 1998 , when @entity8 played @entity16 in @entity17 -- an open - air venue which accommodates more than 5,000 people , but manages to maintain an intimate atmosphere , festooned with candlelit tables closer to the stage			1
it was a humid evening bedeviled by mosquitoes as i stood at the side of that stage with my cameraman awaiting the arrival of the rock legend -- a term with which @entity8 always felt uncomfortable			1
the plan was for a quick chat for @entity4 's global music show world beat before his performance , but @entity8 was running late and the prospect of the interview was quickly disappearing			1
a publicist emerged from a side door to warn us that the window for the interview was about to close			2
he was unusually apologetic and appeared to be sincere			0
the singer 's big band had already taken to the stage as we stood and watched the flurry of activity as roadies , sound techs and the other members of the touring family attended to last - minute duties			1
then a single figure emerged from another doorway and walked briskly through the production area towards us			0
dressed in what appeared to me to be a light - colored linen suit , he strode forward , shook our hands and said : " alright lads , i 'm @entity8			1
i 'm really sorry to keep you waiting but if it 's not too late for you , we can have a chat now			0
" he answered all the standard questions about his role in rock music , his iconic flailing appearance at @entity70 , the changing face of the business , his latest music , as a handful of increasingly fidgety minders checked their watches and glanced repeatedly over their shoulders			0
he appeared to consider his answers carefully and chuckled amiably , exhibiting none of the stress of the anxious assistants behind him			0
during our last question the band struck up what turned out to be the opening number with a great swell of brass joining the familiar rock sound			0
the audience cheered but @entity8 did n't bat an eyelid and continued with his answer			2
at its conclusion he smiled and said in the @entity101 @entity100 accent which never left him : " well lads , it 's been great to meet you and i 've enjoyed chatting but i 'd better be off now -- they 're playing my tune			0
" and with a parting handshake he walked , unhurried , onto the stage and without breaking step , approached the microphone and began to sing , his distinctive voice booming out into the @entity108 evening			0
a man confident in his craft , unassuming in his demeanor and impeccable in his manners			1
it should n't be remarkable and i wo n't claim to have got to know the man from such a snapshot moment but it left a very warm first impression of a man whose music has made an impression on millions around the world			2
