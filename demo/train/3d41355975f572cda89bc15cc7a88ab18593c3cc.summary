, only the fourth @entity3 president to reach that age			1
he 's the last of the @entity6 presidents , the last @entity3 leader to preside over the @entity8 , the last of a generation of elected leaders who saw themselves as old - fashioned public servants rather than cutthroat campaigners			2
today , there are college graduates who were n't even born when he left office			0
so the question is , what can 20 - somethings learn from an old man like @entity1 ? it starts with what @entity1 said to a group of young people in one of the last speeches he gave as president : " what all of us seek in our life is meaning and adventure			1
it 's through service that all of us can find both			1
" he certainly has had 90 years of " meaning and adventure " â € ” flying as one of the youngest @entity41 pilots in @entity6 ; serving in @entity42 during the 1960s ; as @entity3 liaison to @entity44 in the days of @entity45 ; as chair of the @entity47 during @entity48 ; as head of the @entity50 after the @entity51 ; as ambassador to the @entity53 during the @entity8 ; as vice president during the @entity55 ; as president during the collapse of the @entity58			1
and as a post-presidential humanitarian , he has raised millions for cancer research and disaster relief alongside the man who was his most bitter political rival			0
@entity1 had a front - row seat to most of the major events of the second half of the 20th century , and he did it by dedicating his life to service to others			1
" public service is a noble calling , " something he 's said so often that it 's engraved on a bust at his @entity72 of @entity73 and @entity74 at @entity75			1
( the students rub its brass nose for good luck ; he once quipped , " thank @entity80 it was only a bust ! " ) i asked about @entity1 's formula for meaning and adventure when i interviewed 41 extraordinary people for our new documentary about our 41st president , " @entity90			1
" many of the 41 spoke of @entity1 's lifelong commitment to public service , whether in uniform , in appointed positions , through elected office or in community service			1
" this man has affected this country and served this country in so many ways , " said sports commentator @entity98 , " and he 's done it every step of the way with a kind heart , with good intentions , with real concern that he 's doing the right thing to help people			0
" " i do believe , if there were more people like him , the world would be a better place , " president @entity111 told me			2
" if your primary motivation is to serve , then , in an imperfect world , you 're likely to make the right rather than the wrong compromises			2
" his primary motivation was to serve			0
you do n't get to pick the time you serve , and you ca n't control the circumstances in which you govern			0
there 's always some good and some bad in it			0
but he made the most of a hand that was not the easiest hand to play			0
and he did it because , at heart , he 's a servant			0
" @entity133 @entity1 is @entity134 's grandson , and the two have talked about the day his grandfather decided to make the first step in a lifetime of service			1
" he remembers sitting in an @entity141 ] auditorium right after @entity142 was attacked , " @entity133 said			0
" there was this spirit that he wanted to be a part of			0
he wanted to go and defend @entity3 , he wanted to be a part of something bigger than himself			0
" @entity133 sees the parallels with his generation -- in the same longing millennials have to be a part of something larger than oneself			2
his @entity155 homepage quotes his grandfather : " any definition of a successful life must include service to others			1
" @entity133 works for @entity160 in @entity161 and would tell you that his life is full of both meaning and adventure			1
@entity166 is concerned that young people have only seen the worst of elected officials in a gridlocked @entity170 that seems to feed on character assassination			0
she knows how hard it is to decide to go into public service in such a poisonous environment			2
" i would say to young people : never forget that democracy depends on its citizens to care about it , to promote it , to work for it , " @entity176 said			0
" democracies do n't survive if citizens simply leave it to others to do the hard work of governing , and so if you get a chance to be in public service , do it			2
the greatest thing that you can do in your life is to serve your country			2
you could have no better role model than @entity1			1
" @entity1 's life is full of lessons for young people			1
i hope you 'll tune in to @entity0 on @entity199 at 9 p.m. et to hear more about this remarkable @entity3 life			1
you 'll be surprised how much you 'll learn .			0
