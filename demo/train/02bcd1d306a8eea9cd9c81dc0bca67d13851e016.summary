what a difference two years make			0
instead of a band of rabble - rousing conservatives , a markedly different group was plotting campaign strategy with @entity7 @entity6 leaders at a recent party headquarters meeting			1
gone is the @entity11 - infused talk of confrontation			1
this diverse group -- top - tier candidates picked to be in the @entity6 's " @entity16 " program -- includes an openly gay former @entity18 state legislator , an @entity20 female mayor from @entity21 and an @entity23 graduate from @entity24			1
unlike the take - no - prisoners approach of two years ago , these candidates stressed the need to work with @entity28 to get things done in @entity30			1
@entity31 , who was one of the few republicans in the @entity28 - dominated @entity33 , said that voters are frustrated with a polarized @entity35 and that he has a record of getting things done			1
" i can bring my experience , having served in the @entity40 on , you know , a state level , down here and hopefully bring some common sense and willingness to work across the aisle , " @entity31 told @entity38			2
if @entity31 beats eight - term @entity28 rep @entity47 in november , he would be the first @entity7 @entity6 to say he 's gay while running for a first term in office			1
he supports same - sex marriage and signed onto a legal challenge to overturn the @entity53 , a law @entity6 leaders are fighting to uphold in the federal courts			2
" i am a live - and - let - live @entity6			2
i think the government , again , should get off your back , out of your wallet and away from the bedroom , " @entity31 said			0
further proof that he does n't fit the traditional @entity6 candidate mold -- @entity31 refuses to sign a pledge that he will not raise taxes			2
" if there are loopholes that could be closed , help pay down the deficit , i do n't want to tie myself up in knots			0
i want the option of being able to do what needs to be done to help the country , " he said			0
the @entity16 program @entity31 recently joined was started in 2007 by three @entity6 rising stars -- reps			1
@entity76 of @entity77 , @entity78 of @entity79 and @entity80 of @entity24			0
the three were concerned their party was n't doing enough to grow its base and recruit candidates in districts where the @entity6 lost in 2006			2
the program grew to support 90 candidates in 2009 and became part of the @entity89			0
those selected for the program received financial and political support from the national party , and 62 of them won in 2010 , helping to return the @entity7 gavel back to the @entity6			1
@entity28 have a similar program they call " @entity97			0
" @entity80 , who led @entity6 recruiting two years ago , which included outreach to females and minorities , told @entity38 " the caliber of the candidates has only improved higher because of the success of the last one			2
" the third - ranking @entity7 @entity6 said he thinks leaders will pick 30 to 40 @entity16 by this fall			1
fitting the " young " part of the bill is @entity108 @entity107 , 25 , who hopes he 'll become the youngest member of @entity35 next year			0
a @entity111 graduate who has endorsements from popular @entity6 @entity113			0
@entity115 of @entity116 and @entity117 of @entity118 , @entity114 said his campaign represents a " @entity6 version 2.0			0
" he boasts that he 's raised the most money of any @entity6 challenger in the country in his bid to unseat @entity28 rep. @entity126 in @entity24			1
@entity114 said the 9th @entity127 in @entity24 is the " quintessential swing " district			0
" the person who 's going to win that race is the one who creates broad agreement about the issues of our day -- it 's getting people back to work ; it 's focusing on our agriculture economy			0
those actually are consensus issues			0
" more so than @entity31 or @entity114 , @entity139 may defy most people 's expectations of a @entity6 candidate -- a black , conservative mormon from @entity21			1
if elected to represent @entity21 's 4th @entity127 , @entity139 , the mayor of @entity145 , would be the first black @entity6 congresswoman			1
" there are a lot of people who have tried to define me as a person , " @entity139 , a daughter of @entity148 immigrants , told @entity38 's @entity149 in an interview last month			0
this year , @entity80 and other @entity6 said divided government in @entity30 means candidates need to stress their ability to find solutions			1
@entity160 , a senior adviser to @entity161 , a super pac that supports @entity7 @entity6 candidates , told @entity38 that in 2010 candidates talked about repealing president @entity165 's health care overhaul , criticizing the spending in the stimulus program and opposing @entity28 proposals such as cap and trade , but this year the message centers on " solving problems			1
" @entity160 , a former @entity76 aide , said the party 's ideology and issues are n't changing as @entity6 work to increase the @entity6 majority , but he noted " a conservative in @entity18 is going to look a lot different from a conservative in @entity179			2
" his group is evaluating @entity6 candidates across the country and plans to support 15 to 25 this cycle			1
house speaker @entity184 , @entity185 , insists the party is n't getting a makeover , saying friday of these candidates , " we did n't choose them for their demographics or their style			0
they just happen to be good candidates in districts that are winnable for us			0
" democrats facing these @entity199 candidates said their talk of compromise does n't add up			0
early and often @entity28 are tying all of these challengers to the @entity7 @entity6 budget authored by @entity78 , which passed without a single @entity28 vote and which , they argue , will end @entity205			1
@entity114 refuses to get drawn in , saying he " salutes the idea of us having this discussion , " but steers clear of personally endorsing the @entity7 @entity6 plan and instead zeroes in on his support of one piece of the plan that @entity78 co-authored with a @entity33 @entity214			1
@entity28 insist @entity6 will change their moderate message if they win , and they 'll become just like the @entity6 members elected two years ago			1
@entity217 , @entity31 's @entity28 opponent in @entity18 , told @entity38 , " he 's going to fall right in line with them , and they 're the ones that wo n't compromise and we 've had compromise all the way up until the @entity11 election in 2010			2
" rep. @entity227 , an llinois freshman @entity6 who was one of the @entity16 two years ago , said 2010 was " a very special year because people were just ticked off so you saw all these grass - roots @entity230 saying i can run for @entity35 , and i did that as a military guy with no significant legislative experience			1
" but @entity227 said that 2010 was an " outlier " election and that this year candidates need to show a vision for how they 'll produce results			0
" i think it 's important that @entity6 and @entity28 start basically reaching across the aisle and finding the areas ( where ) we agree and at least moving forward on those , " he said			2
despite the anti-incumbent mood and approval ratings for @entity35 at a record low , @entity80 , the @entity7 majority whip , said he believes voters will stick with @entity6 this fall			2
" i think the public sees some change in @entity35 , but they want to finish the job , " he said			0
although @entity184 recently warned there was a 1 - in - 3 chance @entity6 could lose seats in the @entity7 , @entity80 was more bullish on the party 's electoral position , telling @entity38 that " there 's an opportunity to gain in the overall number " of @entity6 seats			1
he cited the @entity16 program as the way to " keep us on offense			0
