@entity0 -- the state - led push to legalize pot is a " chronic " problem for the @entity7 administration			1
marijuana is not only legal in @entity9 and @entity0 , but cannabis has become a cottage industry complete with 420 sampler tours and shops where customers can buy pot brownies or candy in those two states			1
and @entity18 and @entity19 could soon join the 20 states and the @entity21 where medical marijuana is legal , according to the @entity23			2
the administration has taken a fuzzy stance on the matter : in states where it 's legal to puff , the government will pass on punishment			1
" we 're going to see what happens in the experiments in @entity9 and @entity0 , " president @entity7 said in a recent interview with @entity1 's @entity33			1
" the @entity37 ... has said that we are going to continue to enforce federal laws			1
but in those states , we recognize that ... the federal government does n't have the resources to police whether somebody is smoking a joint on a corner			1
" that approach frustrates some in state and federal law enforcement â € ” including the head of the @entity50 , @entity51 , who according to several media reports , blasted the administration 's approach during an annual sheriffs meeting last month			1
@entity57 , an assistant professor of criminal justice at @entity59 , said it is " politically convenient " for the administration to allow the states to tackle pot policy rather than change the federal approach			1
" they see social change happening and they 're caught between a rock and a hard place , " @entity57 said			2
that social change includes a sea change in the way @entity73 view pot use			1
a @entity1 / @entity76 poll last month showed that just over half the country â € ” 55 % â € ” supports marijuana legalization			2
this is up from the 16 % who felt that way a quarter century ago			0
nearly three - quarters of those polled say alcohol is more dangerous than marijuana			2
where pot is legal it 's a sentiment the president shares			1
" as has been well documented , i smoked pot as a kid , and i view it as a bad habit and a vice , not very different from the cigarettes that i smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life , " the president told the @entity88 in a recent interview			2
" i do n't think it is more dangerous than alcohol			0
" shortly after the interview was published , the administration rushed to clarify the president 's position			2
it said the @entity105 opposes a national move to decriminalize pot despite @entity7 's personal views on marijuana use			1
marijuana is currently classified under the @entity111 as " @entity112 , " much like heroin or cocaine , with a high likelihood for abuse and no medical value			2
" what is and is n't a @entity112 narcotic is a job for @entity122 , " @entity7 told @entity33 during the @entity1 interview			2
however , the president did not say during the interview whether he would urge @entity122 to move to reclassify marijuana			0
rep. @entity126 , @entity127 , has been working to gather lawmaker signatures on a letter to @entity7 in support of reclassifying marijuana			1
the administration has previously indicated that it is unlikely to reclassify marijuana under a less stringent category of drugs			2
frustration with what some lawmakers see as the administration 's mixed messaging on marijuana was evident during a @entity144 hearing on tuesday			1
when @entity145 , deputy director of the @entity146 , hedged on answering whether cocaine , methamphetamine or marijuana is more dangerous and addictive @entity126 pounced			0
" if a professional like you can not answer clearly that meth is more dangerous than marijuana which every kid on the street knows , which every parent knows -- if you ca n't answer that maybe that 's why you are failing to educate people about the dangers , " he said			2
" i do n't want kids smoking marijuana			0
... but if the deputy director of the office of drug policy ca n't answer that question how do you expect high school kids to take you seriously ? " feds working on new pot banking rules the administration has " a bad political problem " when it comes to pot , said @entity173 , an assistant professor at the @entity175 's @entity174			1
" i think this is a very difficult position for them and they see it as a lose - lose , " said @entity173 , who served as a drug policy adviser to both @entity178 and @entity179 administrations and is on the board of directors of @entity181 , an anti-pot legalization group			0
" they do n't want to alienate a voting bloc in favor of legalization			0
" @entity7 's views so incensed the @entity50 director that @entity51 blew off a little steam about the topic during the annual meeting of the country 's sheriffs late last month , according to the @entity197			1
sheriffs who were present told the paper she expressed frustration over @entity7 comparing smoking pot to consuming alcohol			1
" her comments are not necessarily unexpected , " said @entity204 , director of federal policies for the @entity206 , a pro pot legalization group			1
there are a lot of folks who have spent the last 20 to 30 years fighting the war on drugs			0
it 's natural for them to revolt			0
" still , the nation 's attitudes and laws regarding marijuana are changing			1
during a drug policy debate at the @entity223 in @entity224 , @entity225 , in january , @entity221 gov. @entity220 said he advocated decriminalizing marijuana			0
but he stopped short of pushing for legalization			0
however , the stance , coming from a @entity178 who once ran for president seems to offer further evidence of a change toward views on marijuana even in conservative corners			2
" as the governor of the second - largest state in the country , what i can do is start us on policies that can start us on the road towards decriminalization , " @entity220 said , adding that he views @entity9 's marijuana laws as constitutional but he opposes a federal mandate			1
the politics of pot even hovered over this year 's so - called " @entity248 " as teams from @entity9 and @entity0 faced off in @entity250 , a state where it 's illegal to toke			1
as @entity254 traffic curled through the @entity250 toward @entity255 , drivers had front row seats to an off - field battle of the billboards by pro and anti-marijuana legalization forces			0
safer than alcohol ... and football , " boasted a billboard by the @entity206			0
" marijuana kills your drive			0
do n't lose in the game of life , " read the counter by @entity181			0
@entity271 and the @entity254 eventually though , both marijuana legalization advocates and opponents say , the federal government will have to clear the smoke			1
" the real issue is : are we going to have a system where 25 states have legalization and 25 states do n't ? " @entity57 said , adding , " things are going to change dramatically after the next two elections in 2014 and 2016 when more states pass this			1
" the direction of federal pot policy could be determined by upcoming midterms and the 2016 presidential election as states weigh whether to legalize marijuana			1
there 's big money at stake			0
billionaire hedge fund manager @entity295 gave $ 1 million in 2010 to help legalize marijuana in @entity297 , a vote which ultimately failed			0
he and fellow billionaires @entity300 and former @entity302 chairman @entity301 , who died late last year , have donated millions to the pot legalization causes in a number of states			0
" the long - hair , tie - dye types cut their hair and put on @entity315 suits and got very serious about pot , " @entity173 said adding that opponents worry marijuana could become " the next big tobacco " with billions of dollars at stake for a product they feel has serious health concerns			2
a slate of anti-government regulation , pro-states rights , @entity178 potential presidential candidates such as @entity19 sen. @entity321 , @entity323 sen. @entity322 and @entity220 will find their positions on marijuana tested by factions within their party that oppose legalization			0
@entity321 opposes legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana for recreational use but recently told the @entity331 that he is open to learning more about medical marijuana			0
last year , during an interview with the @entity334 , @entity322 said he is opposed to legalization but does support decriminalization			0
one place for common ground might be in efforts to decriminalize the penalties for marijuana - related crimes , opponents and advocates say			0
the push to decriminalize pot has made for some unlikely partnerships			0
@entity7 on the problem of criminalizing marijuana use for example , liberal @entity349 sen. @entity349 of @entity350 teamed up with @entity322 , a tea party backed conservative on a measure aimed at changing mandatory minimum sentences for some crimes such like marijuana possession			1
the measure also has the support of sen. @entity359 , @entity360 , and @entity178 sen. @entity178 of @entity361			0
tea party backed @entity363 rep. @entity363 , @entity364 and @entity366 member rep. @entity365 , @entity367 have joined forces on a similar measure that would judges more wiggle room in sentencing			0
@entity7 , civil rights organizations and both pro and anti-marijuana legalization groups all acknowledge that minorities are often disproportionately incarcerated for pot - related crimes			1
" my concern is when you end up having very heavy criminal penalties for individual users that have been applied unevenly and in some cases with a racial disparity , " @entity7 told @entity33 during the @entity1 interview			2
" i think that is a problem			0

@entity7 administration largely taking a pass on *bumper* crop of state pot laws
state and federal lawmen frustrated by *patchwork* of pot laws , @entity7 administration attitude
midterm and 2016 elections could herald a change on nation 's marijuana policies
experts say the federal government will eventually have to step in
