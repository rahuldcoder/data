-- when a ' @entity3 ' roars , @entity1 listens			0
the @entity4 in @entity1 was enveloped by floating sand and dust on march 18 , 2008			1
these huge , sky - blackening dust storms sweep across @entity8 in march and april , bringing with them millions of tons of sand from inner @entity12 and depositing it in @entity14 and on across the @entity15 to @entity16			1
during the past few years the storms have grown in ferocity and scale , and they are at the vanguard of an advancing @entity22 desert that threatens more than 400 million people in the @entity14 provinces of @entity25 , @entity12 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
the economic toll has been estimated to cost the @entity14 economy $ 6.5 billion per year			1
but desertification is not limited to @entity14 and it is fast becoming a serious global problem that will only be exacerbated by climate change			1
in the @entity14 provinces of @entity12 and @entity25 the causes are reasonably straightforward , and in many ways they area is an exemplar of the situation in developing countries worldwide			1
rapid population growth has put enormous pressure on agricultural systems that have been pushed towards unsustainable farming practices in order to cope with demand			0
in @entity14 livestock numbers have nearly doubled in the last 30 years , from around 200 million in the early 1970 's , to 427 million in 2002			1
as a result huge amount of marginal land has been taken in as pasture , overgrazed to the point of exhaustion , and now farmers are being forced to watch the topsoil literally blow away on the spring winds			1
in @entity58 demand for water has shrunk @entity60 by 95 percent since the 1960s , leaving only sand and scrub			0
in @entity64 desertification has meant that nearly 50 percent of cropland has been abandoned since 1980			2
the @entity66 is advancing into @entity67 and @entity68 at the rate of 3,510 square kilometers per year			2
in @entity71 , fierce sandstorms are believed to have buried more than 100 villages in 2002			0
but this is only expected to get worse			0
across the world climate change is set to exacerbate problems where poor land use and population pressure is already putting an immense strain on finely balanced ecologies			2
@entity58 may only be able to feed 25 percent of its population by 2025 , according to the @entity82 in @entity58			0
many countries in the @entity85 basin could face a future of significant food and water shortages as climate change bites and deserts spread			0
already desertification is estimated to cost @entity92 us $ 200 million per year			1
predicting the regional effect of climate change is always difficult , but some scientists are suggesting a four degrees rise in the @entity85 by 2100 , with an associated 10 percent to 40 percent drop in rainfall			0
a change on this scale would cause existing areas of desert to spread and exacerbate the problems associated with erosion , wildfires and the salinization of the water table			2
already water supplies in @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 are at or close to 1,000 cubic meters per person per year , which is widely taken as a benchmark for water scarcity			2
globally crop yields are likely to fall substantially as the area of desert grows across @entity58 , the @entity124 , the @entity125 and @entity126 and this , coupled with associated rising prices for key crops such as maize and soybeans , could threaten food security in some countries			0
scientists also predict that water shortages could increase the risk of supply contamination and associated diseases such as cholera and dysentery			0
because desertification is often caused by population pressure , effective control is hard to achieve and many solutions are focused on dealing with the symptoms rather than the root cause of the problem			1
the @entity14 government is creating a forest belt stretching 2,800 miles ( 4,500 kilometers ) to block the advancing sands of the @entity22 desert and diminish the effect of the sandstorms			1
the @entity154 is seeking support to fund a similar " @entity156 " to hold back the @entity66			1
in @entity109 officials hope that the inauguration of the 250,000 hectare @entity159 will slow the advance of the sands			0
but for such schemes to work they will need to take account of local context and build what @entity166 , director of the @entity167 , calls " a mosaic of local innovations			2
" she cites the regeneration of trees around fields in central @entity174 , and the terraces for soil and water conservation in @entity178 as perfect examples			0
many ecologists argue that it is small , simple , localized changes towards more sustainable patterns of land - use that will offer effective long - term solutions			1
for example , in many areas of the world the search for fuel for cooking fires puts enormous strain on the landscape : as trees are cut down , erosion increases and deserts spread			0
but the shift towards using cheap , fuel - efficient ' rocket stoves ' and solar cookers could cut the amount of wood needed dramatically			2
leguminous plants , such as beans , which ' fix ' nitrogen from the air can be used to help restore fertility in already damaged areas			0
belts of trees and grass can be used to reduce wind velocity and stop sand spreading , and provide a managed resource for local communities			0
in @entity92 , @entity214 , an organization that " aims to develop , demonstrate and communicate accessible , low - tech methods of sustainable living in a semi arid environment " has had enormous success renovating abandoned 1,000 - year old @entity220 irrigation systems			1
they believe that similar systems , alongside " appropriate technology " such as solar heaters and biogas producers , may offer a way to slow desertification in many other countries			0
what is becoming clearer year - by - year is that we ca n't fight the advancing desert - only by looking after the land can we expect it to look after us			1

desertification is fast becoming a global problem
dust storms *affect* 400 million people in @entity14 each year
large - scale projects like ' @entity156 ' are touted as one way to solve the problem
others say that sustainable and careful local land management is the best solution
