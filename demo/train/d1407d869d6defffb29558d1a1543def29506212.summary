-- a new anti-government movement has sprung up among protesters in @entity3 -- and now among their supporters in other countries -- with men posting pictures of themselves on the @entity8 wearing women 's head scarves as a political statement			1
the movement began in recent days as an online backlash after the arrest of one anti-government protester , @entity15			1
the day after his arrest , an @entity3 news agency published a picture of @entity15 dressed in a chador , a black head - to - toe garment worn by @entity3 women			1
the government claimed the man had been caught wearing the garment in an attempt to hide himself and avoid arrest , but opposition bloggers insisted that the photo published by the semi-official @entity31 news agency had been manipulated			1
within hours of the @entity31 report on the arrest of the 22 - year - old protester , men both inside and outside @entity3 responded using a what appears to be a new tactic for the opposition -- they began posting pictures of themselves online wearing head coverings that are mandated for women in the @entity42 republic			1
@entity43 , professor of @entity3 studies at @entity46 's @entity45 , told @entity0 sunday that the pictures are an attempt at causing the @entity3 government 's tactics to " humiliate , intimidate or stifle this movement " to backfire			1
@entity52 cover heads to support protests " they ( @entity3 government officials ) use a standard cliche to try to humiliate men , as if being a woman were something bad , and thousands of @entity3 respond by posting these pictures , showing there is absolutely nothing wrong with women or veiling , " said @entity43 , who is a supporter of the arrested protester , @entity15			1
adding to the controversy is the @entity31 agency 's decision to juxtapose the photos of @entity15 alongside a decades - old photo of the first president of the @entity42 republic , @entity70			1
years ago , @entity3 officials accused @entity70 of using women 's clothes to try to escape arrest			2
in the nearly 30 - year - old image , @entity70 , who was president for one year at the beginning of @entity3 's post-revolutionary period , is shown wearing what appears to be a white floral head scarf			2
though many question the authenticity of the picture , state media at the time used it as evidence that @entity70 attempted to escape the country in a " cowardly " way after his ouster in 1981			0
the @entity31 report gave no explanation for publishing @entity70 's photo alongside @entity15 's , and the two men have no other apparent links			2
a blog that focuses on religion and politics in the @entity42 world -- @entity99 -- interpreted the juxtaposition as being an attempt by the authorities " to humiliate [ @entity15 , using ] an old practice by the government to prove to the public that the opposition leaders are ' less than men , ' lacking courage and bravery			1
" one commentator on that site wrote , " it is ironic how [ the ] head scarf , which was traditionally seen as a symbol of women 's oppression ... is now being used by men to show membership in a liberation movement			2
" a facebook page created friday night for @entity15 exhorts supporters to " condemn the state media 's behavior towards @entity15 , " and " act in solidarity ... to affirm his status as a known symbol of integrity			2
" the page adds that the invitation to wear a head covering is " without connotations to hijab as a religious practice , " and that the group 's leaders are " against any kind of forced or imposed hijab			0
" @entity138 refers to religiously sanctioned dress for men and women in @entity42			0
thus the new protest also speaks to the societal aspect of @entity3 women being forced to accept a dress code , according to @entity43			0
alongside his own photo on @entity147 , @entity43 describes the varied shades of meaning that this particular form of protest holds for him , referring to his rusari , the loosely tied head scarf that covers only the hair			0
" proud to wear my late mother 's rusari , the very rusari that was forced on my wife in @entity3 , the very rusari for which my sisters are humiliated if they choose to wear it in @entity159 , and the very rusari that the backward banality that now rules @entity3 thinks will humiliate @entity15 if it is put on him -- he is dearer and nobler to us today than he ever was			1
" @entity15 remains in custody of @entity3 security forces , and it is not known what he thinks about becoming associated with this particular protest tactic			1
he was arrested after a protest demonstration last monday			0
december 7 is " @entity169 " in @entity3 , an annual observance extolling the virtues of the @entity172 that toppled the @entity174 - backed @entity173 , the shah of @entity3			0
the holiday remembers the killing in 1953 of three university students by the shah 's security forces			0
in a speech before his arrest , @entity15 played on the theme of the day 's historical significance in light of current anti-government protests			2
" stand up against dictatorship and scream all you can against dictatorship			0
we do n't accept a dictatorship any more , " @entity15 said , according to a video of his speech posted on @entity191			0
" let 's go to the gates of the university and one more time let 's show our solidarity and unity			0
" @entity45 's @entity43 said the head scarf protest is a way of showing the same solidarity against a system that came into being after the @entity172			0
" we @entity3 men are late doing this , " @entity43 said			1
" if we did this when rusari was forced on those among our sisters who did not wish to wear it 30 years ago , we would have perhaps not been here today			0
