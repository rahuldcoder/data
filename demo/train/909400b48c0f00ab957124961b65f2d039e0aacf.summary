the world is smaller and people are more mobile than at any time in history			0
this makes it easier than ever for what 's happening anywhere on the globe to harm @entity9 ' health			1
here are five ways diseases in other countries pose a threat : the flu could threaten millions			2
even in a mild year for flu , in the @entity9 alone , there are thousands of deaths , hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations , and billions of dollars in productivity losses			1
in a pandemic , millions of people worldwide could be killed			1
@entity22 influenza , also known as bird flu , is spreading in @entity24 , though fortunately it has not mutated to become an infectious disease outbreak that could threaten the health of people around the world			1
antibiotic resistance is on the rise			1
antibiotic resistance just might be the most urgent health threat facing us now			1
the nightmare strain of bacteria known as @entity36 , carbapenem - resistant @entity37 , arose abroad and was introduced to one state in the @entity9			1
now it 's in at least 44 states			0
it can resist all or almost all antibiotics , kills many of the people who get it in their blood , and spreads its resistance capabilities to other bacteria			2
the @entity48 estimates multidrug - resistant tuberculosis already has infected a half a. million people across the globe			0
a nightmare health scenario we can stop diseases do n't respect borders			0
going abroad can expose travelers to more than new cultures and once - in - a - lifetime experiences			1
more than 1,500 @entity9 travelers get malaria every year , and the numbers are increasing			1
yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes and causes more than 30,000 deaths worldwide each year , primarily in tropical areas of @entity67 and @entity68			2
people coming back from safari might bring back more than just pictures ; they could find themselves facing @entity67 trypanosomiasis , better known as sleeping sickness , transmitted by the tsetse fly found only in rural @entity67			1
" foreign " diseases are now domestic threats			0
we think of parasitic diseases as risks to travelers , but they harm people here at home as well			2
for example , chagas disease is a chronic infection generally acquired by people in rural areas of @entity68 , but about 300,000 people now living in the @entity9 have this disease			1
toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease common in the tropics that infects more than 60 million people in the @entity9			1
while the immune system usually keeps the parasite from making people sick , it can cause death attributed to foodborne illness			0
emerging infections : what 's the next @entity103 ? mosquito - borne diseases such as @entity107 virus , dengue , and chikungunya infect hundreds of thousands of people each year and are spreading globally			2
in the past few years , we 've seen global outbreaks of @entity113 and other deadly viral hemorrhagic fevers			0
5 health challenges for 2014 there are many diseases out there that we do n't even know about			0
our new effort can prevent them from becoming epidemics			0
that 's why @entity124 partners with nations all over the world to detect and respond to disease outbreaks			1
together we responded to more than 250 outbreaks in 2013			0
no single country can deal with these health threats alone			0
cooperation between countries has tremendous impact in early detection			0
early detection of a single case of ebola virus in 2011 led to an immediate response and the disease was stopped in its tracks			2
previous similar outbreaks were large and spread rapidly through communities there			0
@entity124 is helping countries around the world strengthen their ability to prevent avoidable catastrophes and epidemics , detect threats early , and respond rapidly and effectively			1
stopping outbreaks where they occur is the most effective and least expensive way to save lives at home as well as abroad			0
and it 's the right thing to do			0
that 's why we announced thursday that the @entity9 , through the work of the @entity124 and the departments of @entity159 , @entity160 , and @entity161 , has committed to cooperate with at least 30 partner countries to better prevent , detect , and effectively respond to infectious disease threats , better protecting at least 4 billion people around the world -- including the @entity9 -- from threats			1
how to prevent the next pandemic and we have called on partner countries to work together so that effective prevention , detection , and response are present in every country around the world			2
this year @entity124 and the @entity174 have pledged $ 40 million to expand to 10 additional countries in addition to the pilot projects in @entity178 and @entity179			2
president @entity180 will request an additional $ 45 million in 2015 to accelerate progress around the world			0
it 's an essential step in strengthening global health security that will protect @entity9 , strengthen our nation 's global partnerships , and increase health security capacity around the world			1
helping other countries makes those countries , and the @entity9 , safer			2
the most infectious of all infectious diseases			0

millions could die in a worldwide influenza pandemic
antibiotic resistance is growing globally and in the @entity9
travelers may bring back more than *souvenirs* from abroad
the @entity124 is partnering with other nations to strengthen disease response
