-- the underwater drone scanning the ocean for @entity3 ended its eighth mission monday , having covered about two thirds of its intended territory without finding any sign of the missing plane			1
this has been the case for 45 days now , which seems like an eternity for the relatives of the 239 passengers and crew on board , still hoping for a miracle or , at least , closure			1
" emotionally , it 's up and down			1
you know ? sometimes , i 'm ok			0
sometimes , so - so			0
sometimes -- always -- very sad , " said @entity22 , whose husband worked on the flight 's cabin crew			1
the couple had been planning to celebrate their 13th anniversary this year			0
they have three children , ages 12 , 10 and 8			1
recalling a conversation she had with her husband before he left , @entity32 said : " i was asking him , ' are we going to have the next 13 years together ? ' of course			0
" about their children , she said : " they have faith that their father will be coming back			1
" the @entity43 began its eighth mission sunday , surveying the bottom of the southern @entity46 for traces of the @entity48			1
it is expected to start its ninth mission later monday			1
these efforts may be a main focus of the search , but they are n't the only part			1
@entity55 's @entity54 announced monday morning that up to 10 military aircraft and 11 ships would participate in the day 's search			1
previously , acting @entity60 transport minister @entity59 said that " experts have narrowed down the search area			1
" but are they actually closer to finding anything ? " it 's difficult to say , " @entity59 conceded , adding the search " is at a critical juncture			1
" " i appeal to everybody around the world , " he said , " to pray and pray hard that we find something to work on over the next couple of days			2
" the failure to find clues to the plane 's disappearance does not mean that the operation will stop , only that other approaches -- such as a wider scope or the use of other assets -- may be considered , @entity59 told reporters			1
" the search will always continue			2
" still , he said , " with every passing day , the search has become more and more difficult			2
" @entity86 is n't making this task much easier			0
@entity88 is circulating northwest of the search area			1
and while it wo n't hit directly , this system should increase winds and rains			0
@entity60 authorities briefed families of people aboard flight 370 behind closed doors sunday afternoon in @entity99 , @entity60			0
@entity100 , whose 29 - year - old son was a passenger , told @entity0 that officials dealt with practical matters , such as how the families could make bank transactions			0
@entity106 , whose daughter and son - in - law were on the plane , said he learned nothing new at the briefing			2
" i believe that the government did n't try to hide something , or hide any information from us			0
they are telling the truth			0
but then , mostly the members of victims , the families , they do not want to believe , " he said			0
his wife falls into that category			2
" my wife can not accept that			2
she still believes that the airplane was hijacked			0
she believes that my daughter is still alive			0
" passengers ' relatives list questions it was early on march 8 when @entity3 set off from the @entity60 capital of @entity99 , destined for @entity133			1
the plane never made it			2
what happened has been a confounding mystery , with the frustration of passengers ' family members compounded by a scarcity of details from authorities			0
new bits of information that have come out six weeks later may help round out the picture but do n't answer the main question : why did the plane go off course , and where is it now ? these recent developments include a senior @entity60 aviation source 's assertion that the jetliner deviated from its flight path while inside @entity156 airspace			1
it turned left , then climbed to 39,000 feet -- below its maximum safe limit of 43,100 feet -- and maintained that altitude for about 20 minutes over the @entity161 before beginning to descend , the source said			0
@entity162 has declined to answer @entity0 's questions on various matters -- including the fact that , according to the source , the missing jet was equipped with four emergency locator transmitters			1
when triggered by a crash , @entity169 are designed to transmit their location to a satellite			0
relatives of people aboard the jetliner have drawn up 26 questions that they want addressed by @entity60 officials , who are to meet with them next week in @entity133			0
most of the @entity3 passengers were @entity180			1
among them : what 's in the flight 's log book ? can they review the jet 's maintenance records ? can they listen to recordings of the @entity48 pilot 's conversations with air traffic controllers just before contact was lost ? @entity59 has defended his government 's handling of the operation and accused members of the media of focusing on the @entity180 families			2
he said relatives of passengers and crew from other nations represented have not had problems			2
" the most difficult part of any investigation of this nature is having to deal with the families , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity208 contributed to this report .			0
