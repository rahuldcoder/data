-- he seemed , at that moment , less like a rock star than like someone who sort of wandered on stage from the multitudes of motley young people jostling and undulating in the meadow			0
he appeared dazed and confused : a scruffy , spectacularly unglamorous fellow who somehow found himself among the rock ' n ' roll aristocracy who showed up in @entity13 , @entity14 , 45 summers ago to help administer a collective blessing upon a generation			2
then @entity18 started to sing a song that , it 's safe to say , everybody within hearing range of that stage knew by heart			1
it was what was widely recognized as the " @entity28 " number from the already classic @entity30 album , " @entity31 , " from two years ago			2
" with a @entity38 " was the kind of catchy , user - friendly ditty that even a stuffy grown - up could love enough to sing along with decades before anyone heard the word " karaoke			2
" anybody , in other words , could make the song work for them , whether in a shower or a corner bar			0
@entity18 , at that moment , did more than just make it work			0
he worked that song over , ripping its delicate , amiable stitching apart and transfiguring it into something with more grandeur , tumult and dramatic tension than the @entity30 could have imagined			0
the cameras that captured that transfixing performance for all time stayed on him for practically the entire song , drifting up and down @entity18 's spasmodic form , focusing on his hands as they mimed an invisible instrument wrenching every lick , spin and extended variation he could summon through the vibrant coarseness of his voice			1
that little ditty @entity28 introduced to the world became , in @entity18 's fitful , jerking hands , an epic flag waver , a soul - music anthem			1
@entity18 did n't just " cover " that song			2
he conquered it and made it his own			0
his performance , one of the many peaks of the 1970 eponymous documentary about that festival , " @entity13 , " was the first thing most people of a certain age thought of when they heard the news of @entity18 's death at 70 from lung cancer			1
it was what monday 's @entity87 broadcast mentioned first and foremost when mentioning @entity18 's passing and the film clip accompanied many tweets and posts on social media			1
@entity96 as that moment was , it was only the beginning of a solid , steady career for @entity18 , who scored serial blues - rock hits throughout the 1970s , including " @entity101 " and " @entity102			1
" his 1982 duet with @entity104 , " @entity105 , " pretty much capped his string of hits			0
his gravelly voice and his contortions , however , remained in demand throughout the world , and it says something about his enduring appeal that so many people from different generations say they went straight to those and other tunes to hear that aching , fiery growl once again			0
most appropriately , for a man who exploded into being at a long - ago festival devoted to " peace and love , " there came a special tweet today from someone wishing the same to @entity18 's spirit			1
it came from @entity28 .			0

@entity129 : @entity18 made *iconic* version of " with a @entity38 " at @entity13
he says on news of his death , song is what everyone thought of . he conquered it , made it his own
he says it began @entity18 's solid blues career that crossed several generations
