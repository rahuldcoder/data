@entity0 , @entity1 -- skydiver @entity3 is aiming to pull off a record - breaking free - fall jump from the edge of space tuesday , wearing nothing but a space suit , a helmet and a parachute			1
his goal is not only to jump from a higher altitude than anyone ever has -- 120,000 feet , more than three times the cruising altitude of the average airliner			1
he also hopes to be the first person to break the sound barrier , without the aid of anything besides the space suit			1
at that altitude , the thin air provides so little resistance that after just 40 seconds , he is expected to be free - falling faster than 690 miles an hour			1
" i 'm not nuts , " @entity3 said when @entity2 first interviewed him about the project in 2010			1
" you know , our records are meant to be broken , and i 'm a very competitive person			2
" ' human helicopter ' breaks record for world 's longest flight but on a more serious note , he added , " of course i 'm afraid of dying , because i worked so hard to reach this level			1
you know , i 'm living a good life			0
i think the most important thing i 'm doing is to come back alive			0
" after years of preparations and untold costs to his primary sponsor @entity41 , the jump is scheduled for tuesday morning at dawn			2
@entity3 expects to spend two or three hours on the ascent , in a capsule hanging from a helium balloon			1
then he will climb out of his capsule , jump off the step with a bunny hop and form a crouched " delta " position to maximize his speed			1
he plans to fall 115,000 feet in less than five minutes , before deploying a parachute for the final 5,000 feet to earth			2
the attempt has serious risks			2
he and his team have practiced how he can avoid getting trapped in a dangerous " horizontal spin			0
" and at temperatures that could hit 70 degrees below zero @entity60 or lower , and an atmosphere so thin that his blood would vaporize if he were unprotected , his life will depend on the integrity of his pressure suit			1
and if he loses consciousness during the five - minute plunge , he will survive only if his parachute deploys automatically			1
another unknown : the effects on the body of breaking the sound barrier			1
while reaching such speeds can cause stress on an aircraft , planners for this jump believe that there will be little effect on @entity3 , because he will be at an altitude at which there is so little air , shock waves are barely transmitted			1
@entity3 is an @entity83 helicopter pilot and former soldier who has @entity85 jumped from landmarks like the @entity87 in @entity88 and the @entity90 statue in @entity91			2
he has been preparing for five years -- both physically and mentally			0
" you have to remember all the procedures , " he said in an interview during testing for the jump			0
" you know you 're in a really hostile environment			0
and you can not think about anything else			0
you have to be focused			0
otherwise , you 're gon na die			0
" the balloon , over 500 feet tall at launch , is light and translucent			0
the material is only .0008 of an inch thick , and it will change shape and size as it rises			0
the pressurized helmet and suit , which restrict @entity3 's mobility and weigh 100 pounds , have been equipped with sensors and recorders to measure everything from his speed to his heart rate			1
cameras on the ground and on the capsule will transmit live images of his attempt			0
@entity3 was not doing interviews on the eve of the jump , but his performance coach @entity124 on sunday described him as mentally well - prepared			1
" he knows that he 's rehearsed it and knows what to do , " he said			0
" we want him in the right state of mind			0
we ask him to reflect on what he 's done , what he 's been through and what he 's achieving for himself personally , so he can relax and focus			0
" the record is currently held by col. @entity134 , who in 1960 jumped from 102,800 feet as part of a @entity138 @entity137 mission			1
on this attempt , 52 years later , @entity134 is a consultant and mentor			2
he has also been giving @entity3 advice on what to expect			2
for example , he described what it feels like to fall through space when there is so little air : " there 's no way you can tell how fast you 're going , because there 's no visual cues			2
" but @entity134 rejects any suggestion that he is jealous that @entity3 is poised to beat his record			1
" oh no. i 'm delighted , " he told @entity2 recently			0
" he 's advancing science , and he 'll do a great job			0

@entity3 will have only a space suit , helmet and parachute for 120,000 - foot jump
record of 102,800 feet was set in 1960 and is held by current mission 's consultant and mentor
@entity3 also hopes to be first person to break the sound barrier without a *vehicle* 's aid
besides speed , risks *include* low temperatures , thin atmosphere , possible loss of consciousness
