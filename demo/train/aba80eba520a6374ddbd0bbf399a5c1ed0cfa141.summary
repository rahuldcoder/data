@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , one of the most effective commanders among @entity6 forces in @entity1 , has seen plenty of combat in his 45 years			1
a well - built , bearded man with dark , serious eyes , he fought against the @entity12 occupation of @entity13 -- and alongside @entity14 in the dying days of the @entity16 regime			1
now he is commander of the @entity6 forces in @entity0 , and swears loyalty to the @entity19 , describing himself as an " ordinary @entity1 " fighting for a common cause			1
but there 's not much ordinary about @entity3			1
as a young man in the late 1980s , he was one of scores of jihadists in the @entity26 that went to fight in @entity13			2
his military prowess soon made him a commander among his fellow fighters			0
after the fall of the @entity16 , @entity3 left @entity13 and was arrested in @entity31 in 2004			1
after some questioning by the @entity33 , he was sent back to @entity1 and jailed			2
@entity3 was released from @entity36 's notorious @entity35 jail last year			1
he and dozens of others of @entity26 fighters negotiated with the @entity36 regime for their freedom -- in return for denouncing @entity14 and its philosophy of jihad			2
the negotiations were led by a former @entity26 member in exile , @entity47 , and @entity48 , one of the sons of the @entity1 leader and a man that @entity3 is now hunting			1
the @entity36 regime had jailed hundreds of @entity53 , among them fighters of the @entity26 who had launched a short - lived insurgency in the 1990s			0
many were massacred during a prison revolt in 1996			0
western counterterrorism experts are now at best concerned -- and at worst alarmed -- by the prominent role @entity3 and the @entity26 cadres have played in @entity1 's revolt			1
but sitting in an air - conditioned room in one of @entity0 's most exclusive hotels , @entity3 was keen to dispel the notion that he is part of an @entity68 fifth column preparing to make a power grab in the new @entity1			1
" i am an ordinary citizen of @entity1			2
i am a part of the fabric of this nation , a normal muslim , " he said in long - winded and carefully worded classical @entity70			0
the @entity26 " was not a terrorist organization , " he said			0
" all our activities were inside our country with the aim of liberating our people from @entity36			0
that 's why we met and that 's why we worked			0
we did not give any blessing to any act that would hurt civilians or destroy public sector establishments , and anyone who has kept up with our activities knows that			0
" @entity3 has played a crucial role in liberating @entity0			1
units under his control seized @entity36 's sprawling @entity92 compound days after the rebels entered @entity0			0
he insists his goals are at one with those of the @entity19			0
" we are part of the @entity1 people			1
we did not carry out any military acts with a particular ideology or under any flag , " he said			0
flanked by his press assistant , a former @entity26 member who became an accountant in @entity103 , @entity3 continued : " we treated everybody equally with one purpose , and that is to achieve the goals of the february 17 revolution			2
" " i have not seen anything that would potentially damage the relationship between everybody who worked on the liberation of the cities that they were in , " he added			0
but there have been signs of tensions between former @entity26 members and rank - and - file fighters who joined the revolt and are perturbed to see such a prominent @entity68 figure gain so much power			1
for his part , @entity3 is now focused on finding @entity36			1
" a lot of the information that we receive points to more than one area because we are focusing on more than one area , " @entity3 said			2
" he might be between @entity129 ( a @entity131 town in the desert ) and @entity133 , trying to find a route to the south of the country as the pressure increases on him			0
" @entity36 " is trying to secure a location for himself and is releasing ridiculous statements to incite some na√Øve people , to motivate some people he describes as his loyalists to alter the current security situation			0
" @entity3 expressed hope that the violence in @entity1 would soon be over			1
" we hope that will happen without any more bloodshed or destruction of public property , " he said			0
" we call for the surrender of those who continue to support the regime			0
" that was why , he said , the @entity19 had extended the deadline for @entity36 forces in @entity133 to lay down their weapons			0
@entity3 also said he had spoken to one of @entity36 's sons , @entity160 , who has called for an end to the fighting			2
" i told him that we would assure his safety and that no one would harm him , " @entity3 said , but added : " the legal matters we do not control			2
we are striving to establish a nation of laws			0
we want justice to prevail -- that we have lacked for 40 years			0
" @entity3 also reflected on his time in @entity13 , stressing that he and others in the @entity26 were not affiliated with @entity14			1
" our presence in @entity13 with or without @entity14 does not mean that we agree with them			1
our presence in @entity13 was to support the just cause of the @entity13 fight against the @entity12 , " he said			1
" we went to support the people , and we extended a hand to them in education and aid			0
... we also helped to defend and fight , as did many other nations that joined , including the @entity185 , " @entity3 said in what seemed like an effort to reassure @entity183			2
" as for our presence in @entity13 , ( just because it ) coincided with the presence of @entity14 does not mean that we agree or believe in the same ideology			1
" whether @entity3 and others who belonged to the @entity26 will continue to sing in tune with the @entity19 is the great unknown			2
i have followed the group 's evolution for years , and it seems they truly came to perceive @entity195 's nihilistic campaign against the west as counter-productive , and @entity14 's indiscriminate attacks on " non-believers " as unjustifiable			1
while in jail at @entity35 , a prison less than a mile from the @entity36 compound that @entity3 helped seize , the @entity26 fighters wrote a long theological treatise that attacked @entity14 's core principles			1
at the end of our interview , @entity3 again took pains to reassure the wider world of @entity53 ' role in the @entity1 uprising			1
" i want to take this opportunity to assure to all that the revolutionaries in @entity1 are united , and there is nothing frightening , " he said			2
" they all joined hands against this tyrant and now the revolution is achieving its goals			0
... there is nothing more important than securing our nation			0
" there are plenty of political models for @entity1 's @entity53 to adopt and adapt -- in @entity227 and @entity228 for example , where newly resurgent @entity68 parties and groups profess to be committed to democracy and constitutional government			1
the question is : will they ?			0

@entity3 is one of @entity1 's top @entity6 rebel commanders
some western *analysts* are concerned with his prominent role , given his past association with @entity68 forces
@entity3 was part of a group of @entity1 that fought alongside @entity14 against the @entity12 in @entity13
@entity3 says the fact that he fought alongside @entity14 does *n't* mean he agrees with the aims of the organization
