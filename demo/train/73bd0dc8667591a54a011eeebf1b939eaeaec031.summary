-- an @entity2 judge has denied @entity4 's request that her court fight with ex-boyfriend @entity6 over custody of their son be kept private to avoid a " media circus			1
" the daughter of former @entity2 gov. @entity12 is seeking full custody of 1 - year - old @entity14 , contending that @entity6 is too immature to be a responsible father and that his mother 's felony drug conviction makes her a danger to the child			1
@entity4 filed for full custody in november , but @entity6 is seeking shared custody			1
their teenage relationship fell under an intense public spotlight after sen. @entity25 picked @entity12 as his vice presidential running mate in august 2008			0
court documents , now unsealed , were published online monday by the @entity28			1
@entity6 joined the family at the @entity30 after the campaign confirmed that @entity4 , then 17 , was five months pregnant with his child			2
the couple broke off their engagement about two months after their son 's birth in december 2008			0
@entity6 has asked that the case conducted in public to protect himself from @entity12 , whom he said was " powerful , politically ambitious and has a reputation for being extremely vindictive			1
" but @entity4 's request that the case be sealed said public proceedings " will turn this custody case into a media circus which is not in @entity14 's best interest			1
" " in this day and age of the @entity51 , media stories remain available for years , even decades , after they are first published , and anything printed in the media ( whether it is true or not ) will be available to @entity14 when he is old enough to read , " @entity4 said in a sworn affidavit			2
she said @entity6 wanted a public case so he could " continue to make a spectacle of this custody dispute for his own self - promotion			1
" @entity6 was set to take part in a reality show in @entity2 , she said			0
" i do not believe that it would be in @entity14 's best interest for @entity6 's reality show to be filming this case as it unfolds , or for @entity6 to be capitalizing off of this custody case through his reality show , " @entity4 said			1
@entity6 's sworn statement said he feared what @entity12 might do against him if the case were kept secret			2
" i really think that closing the court could make this matter very uncivil and potentially open the door for poor influences on @entity4 and her attorney that may be extremely inappropriate and potentially harmful to @entity14 , " he said			2
while @entity6 said his former girlfriend would never be malicious toward him , " her mother is powerful , politically ambitious and has a reputation for being extremely vindictive			2
" " so , i think a public case might go a long way in reducing @entity12 's instinct to attack and allow the real parties in this litigation , @entity4 and i , to work things out a lot more peacefully than we could if there is any more meddling from @entity12 , " @entity6 said			1
@entity4 's affidavit said her mother is not involved in the custody case , except as a grandmother			1
but @entity6 's lawyer , @entity93 , said in his own affidavit that his client does not trust closed proceedings because " @entity12 is known to deal forcefully with those she perceives as political enemies			1
" " he feels @entity12 , through her lawyer , under the guise of @entity4 's name , would run roughshod over his very bones , " @entity93 said			0
the judge 's ruling , signed last week , concludes that @entity4 " failed to demonstrate that this case involves ' matters of a sensitive and highly personal nature ' of such a magnitude that ' protection of the party 's name outweighs the public 's interest in disclosure			1
' " her filing for full custody argued that @entity6 was " not ready for the demands of parenthood and the sacrifices that would entail to a 19 - year - old aspiring actor / model			2
" " @entity6 remains without a regular job or steady source of income , " the petition states			0
while he 's not enrolled in school " to learn a trade or earn a degree , " he has made money by selling stories about his son and the @entity132 to news outlets and engaged in " risque modeling for @entity135 , " it states			0

' " @entity6 's response said he does not have a @entity144 account " and has made no such statements about the use of marijuana			0
" but @entity4 's harshest attack was on @entity6 's mother , @entity156 , who pleaded guilty to a felony drug charge earlier this year			1
@entity4 asked that the paternal grandmother be barred from having any unsupervised visitation with @entity14			0
her petition said she " may re-offend , keep medications around the house which could be accessible to the baby , have illegal drug users come to the house ( or she could take the baby in her car during a drug sale )			0
" @entity4 also said that since @entity156 " could fall asleep or be too drowsy to appropriately monitor the baby			0
" " she is also a chronic pain patient and undergoes daily , regular and sustained narcotic infusions , " @entity4 's petition said			0
