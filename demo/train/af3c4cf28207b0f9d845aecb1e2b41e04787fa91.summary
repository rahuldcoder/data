in the space of just 48 hours last week , @entity0 went from calling the @entity2 -- the @entity3 defending the @entity5 border town of @entity6 -- a terrorist group to opening up an arms corridor from @entity9 to aid its fight against @entity11			1
that dramatic change in policy , along with growing collaboration between the @entity15 and the @entity2 ( the armed wing of the @entity2 ) , could tip a month - long battle against @entity11 militants in favor of the @entity3			1
it could also , finally , pave the way for a resolution between @entity0 and the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) , which has waged a three - decade insurgency against the @entity0 state			1
this would remove a major irritant in the coalition 's strategy in @entity5			0
@entity0 leaders in @entity30 resisted domestic and international pressure to aid the @entity2 for a month while @entity6 became the focal point of the operation against @entity11			1
@entity0 's @entity3 took to the streets to demonstrate against what they saw as the government 's refusal to protect their kin next door			0
in reaction to president @entity42 's indifference to the prospect of the massacre of @entity3 at the hands of the @entity46 , the @entity22 's imprisoned leader , @entity47 , said that if the town fell he would end the peace negotiations with @entity30 that have been in progress since 2012			2
with help arriving from the @entity53 and the @entity15 , the prospect of losing @entity6 is no longer imminent			2
the @entity0 government can breathe a sigh of relief , but not for long			0
@entity58 's decision to help the @entity2 militarily marks the emergence of a new alliance at a time when @entity0 has already been unnerved by the recent diplomatic boost the group has received in the @entity64			1
in response to the growing @entity46 threat , the @entity22 , the @entity53 , and the @entity2 have established a united @entity22 front , with the @entity2 militants coming to the aid of @entity53 fighters and halting the jihadi group 's advance into the autonomous region of northern @entity9			2
@entity2 forces helped thousands of @entity75 escape from the western part of the region as @entity11 attacked , making the group the @entity64 's best hope for on - the - ground troops and winning it positive reviews in the @entity83 media			0
since the @entity22 started its assault against the @entity46 in northern @entity9 , there has been a lot of talk in @entity83 capitals about removing it from the terror list			0
the @entity15 move to openly ally with the @entity2 only adds to @entity0 's fears			1
but if @entity0 's leaders manage to look beyond their long - running @entity22 phobia , they could turn the @entity2 - @entity15 dialogue to their advantage			1
the @entity22 , with its new international legitimacy and the alliance the @entity15 forged with its @entity5 offshoot , is unlikely to put these gains at risk by resuming violence against @entity0			1
for @entity0 , the @entity22 issue is more than a domestic security problem ; its concern over @entity22 autonomy in northern @entity5 has diminished its room for maneuver and has kept it from playing an effective role both in the @entity111 and the @entity113 coalition			2
@entity0 has already been marginalized in regional affairs due to other foreign policy miscalculations , and it can not afford to miss out on a seat at the table on @entity5 because of its reservations about the @entity2			0
@entity0 shares a long border with @entity5 , hosts 1.6 million @entity5 refugees , and has historical ties to @entity5 's ethnic and sectarian communities			0
home to well - established @entity125 networks , @entity0 is one of the countries most vulnerable to attacks by the @entity46			0
it is thus in @entity30 's interest to treat the peace process with the @entity22 more urgently so that it can attend to these pressing matters			0
nevertheless , @entity0 's policies still prioritize undercutting the @entity3 over any other concern			0
its policies are largely to blame for the @entity3 ' failure to join the @entity83 backed @entity5 opposition , and it has been dragging its feet to join the @entity15 - led coalition against the @entity46 because it views @entity11 as an effective fighting force not just against the @entity142 regime , but also against the @entity2			1
a @entity15 - @entity2 - @entity0 partnership , however , could work toward the removal of the @entity142 regime , which @entity30 says is its top priority in @entity5			1
@entity0 has criticized the @entity15 - led coalition for prioritizing the removal of @entity11 without addressing the root cause of the problem : the regime in @entity151			1
the @entity15 , however , could engage the @entity2 in pursuing both objectives			0
with the right push from @entity58 and @entity30 , the @entity3 , with their secular bent and effective fighting force , could become part of the ground force that the @entity64 so desperately needs in @entity5			0
the @entity15 has taken a positive step in reconsidering its approach vis - Ã  - vis the @entity2			2
at a time when the lingering @entity22 issue has caused @entity0 to become marginalized in the fight against @entity11 , both the @entity22 and @entity30 would be well - served if they took steps to advance the stalled peace process			2
let 's hope the @entity15 and @entity0 decisions to help the @entity2 are more than tactical @entity170 more : @entity174 's newest allies , @entity5 's @entity172 more : @entity53 fighters ' to enter @entity6 soon '			1

@entity0 has switched from calling @entity22 @entity2 fighters terrorists to supporting them
move could help bring to an end the weeks - long battle for the border town of @entity6 , says @entity183
" it could also pave the way for a resolution between @entity0 and the @entity22 "
@entity183 says a @entity15 - @entity2 - @entity0 alliance could work toward the removal of the @entity142 regime
