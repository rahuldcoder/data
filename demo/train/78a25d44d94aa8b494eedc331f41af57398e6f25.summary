-- just in time for @entity3 , the new season of " @entity2 " has fans checking for monsters -- actually , make that clowns -- under the bed			1
@entity8 and @entity10 's acclaimed anthology series debuted its fourth season wednesday night , this time taking viewers inside a carnival of " curiosities " stationed in @entity17 , @entity18 , in 1952			1
" @entity2 's " previous seasons have involved a haunted house , an asylum and a coven of witches			1
several of the fx series ' usual players are back , including @entity26 as the show 's ringleader ; @entity29 as @entity30 , a.k.a. the housewife - pleasing " @entity31 " ; @entity33 as @entity34 , the " bearded lady " ; @entity36 as the three - breasted @entity37 ; and @entity38 as conjoined twins @entity39 and @entity41 -- and yes , @entity35 plays both parts			2
" bringing her to walking , talking two - headed life is achievement enough			0
... but the real special effect is @entity35 , who invests the two sisters with such distinct personalities , " said @entity46 's @entity45 in a review			2
" the way the two @entity52 carry themselves and react to each other -- even argue -- is a triumph of both editing and performance			0
she 's her own best co-star , playing her own worst enemy			2
" in addition to these ' 50s - era sideshow stars , there 's someone else lurking around town : @entity66 's incredibly creepy clown , @entity67 , who happens to have a penchant for murder and kidnapping			0
in other words , exactly what you want to see right before you turn out the lights			0
it was apparently a bit much for some			0
but reaction from critics has been more mixed			0
" ' @entity82 ' ... still has the high style we 've grown to expect , " said the @entity81 ' @entity80			1
" and it still has plenty of clever touches in word and picture ... but it 's not particularly scary , and does n't even feel that creepy or freakish , despite the sideshow setting and the obvious attempt to emulate one of the eeriest of @entity96 movies , @entity98 's ' freaks , ' from 1932			0
" @entity99 agreed that " @entity2 : @entity82 " owes much to that 1932 film but adds that " @entity10 and @entity101 pay homage to that movie while skillfully mixing fresh aspects with the familiar			1
' @entity2 ' may no longer have the element of surprise on its side , but it remains , to quote the lyrics of a certain @entity110 tune performed by ( @entity26 ) @entity26 , the freakiest show			2
" @entity113 's @entity112 cautioned that it 's too early to tell , but at least " on the basis of its first two episodes , " " @entity2 : @entity82 " appears " to be the best ( season ) yet , or at the very least , the best directed			1

" @entity2 : @entity82 " *premiered* wednesday

some viewers were *sufficiently* scared
