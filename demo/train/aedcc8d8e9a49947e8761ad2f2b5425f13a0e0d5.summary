@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 never became a household name like some of the other women			1
even for the people in the historically black @entity13 neighborhood of @entity0 , where sense of community and oral history thrive , memories of @entity10 are hazy			1
" was n't she the girl whose body they found up on the mountain ? " people ask			1
@entity10 went missing on october 10 , 2009			1
several weeks later , a hiker discovered the 23 - year - old 's decomposed body on @entity26 , near @entity27 , a retreat owned by @entity30 's @entity29			1
@entity0 police and the @entity32 hunted for @entity10 's killer in vain			1
a year after her death , authorities admitted their leads had gone cold			1
as the years wore on , @entity10 's family learned to live without knowing who committed this heinous act			1
or why she was robbed of life			0
their hope of learning the truth diminished with time			0
one night last month , @entity46 student @entity8 disappeared after going out with friends			0
the arrest of a suspect in that case has prompted authorities to take another look at @entity10 's death and several other unsolved cases of women who were murdered , raped or went missing			1
police have charged @entity57 with abduction with the intent to defile in @entity61 's disappearance			1
they said forensic evidence also links @entity57 to at least two other cases : the death of @entity7 , whose body was discovered in @entity67 in 2010 , and a 2005 rape of a 26 - year - old woman in @entity70			1
@entity57 was also accused of a 2002 rape at @entity29 in @entity0 , though charges were not pressed			0
the @entity32 is investigating any possible connection between @entity57 and @entity10			1
sheriff @entity74 declined further comment on an ongoing investigation			0
the result of all this has been that suddenly , almost five years after her death , @entity10 's face is all over the media again			1
it has meant torture , all over again , for her mother , @entity85			0
she again felt the kind of shock that jolted her when police showed up at her doorstep several days after @entity90			2
they showed her a photograph of the body			2
she recognized her daughter 's moccasins and beige jacket			2
they told her they had matched @entity3 's dental records to the body that was discovered			1
@entity85 fell to the floor			0
" she has n't been right ever since , " says her husband and @entity3 's stepfather , @entity104			1
police seize cab of man linked to 2009 death overshadowed by a ' damsel in distress ' ? @entity3 's cremated remains rest in an urn her mother keeps by her bed			1
it 's a constant reminder of the daughter she lost ; a reminder that her killer remains unpunished			2
every morning , @entity85 prays for her daughter 's soul			2
she takes comfort in knowing that 250 people showed up at her daughter 's funeral at the tree of life ministries a few blocks up the road from her rented duplex on @entity130			2
she swallows eight or nine pills a day to treat her depression and hypertension			0
there 's not much she can do about the anger that rises within			2
why did her daughter 's death not make national headlines like @entity61 or @entity7 ? why did no one from the state come to help her in her hour of grief and pain ? @entity10 's death was never big news			1
and it was always overshadowed by news about @entity7 , who went missing six days after @entity10 vanished			1
in fact , when @entity10 's body was discovered , some headlines wondered if it might be that of @entity7 , whose parents had been vocal from the first day about their daughter 's strange disappearance from a @entity156 concert at the @entity46 campus in @entity158			1
they appeared on television and created a website to seek justice for their daughter			0
" there 's been so much publicity about @entity7 , about @entity8 , " @entity104 says			1
he is blind in his left eye and suffers from high blood pressure			0
he used to work for the school system , then performed odd jobs here and there			0
but these days , he and @entity85 barely survive by collecting disability			0
" the @entity176 can afford a reward to find their daughter 's killer , " he says , sitting on a small front porch cluttered with things			2
" we 're poor and black			0
" his stepdaughter , @entity104 says , did n't fit the profile of missing women who make headlines			1
like @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			0
" it 's hard to deny that race has something to do with the fact that attractive young white women get vastly more coverage when they disappear , " says @entity191 @entity190 , an editorial writer at the @entity192 , who wrote about the so - called @entity193 in a recent column			1
the @entity202 's @entity201 first described the media fascination in a 2005 column in which he described " @entity205			2
" " a damsel must be white			0
it helps if her frame is of dimensions that breathless cable television reporters can credibly describe as ' petite , ' and it also helps if she 's the kind of woman who would n't really mind being called ' petite , ' a woman with a good deal of princess in her personality			1
she must be attractive -- also nonnegotiable			0
her economic status should be middle class or higher , but an exception can be made in the case of wartime			0
" put all this together , and you get 24 - 7 coverage , " @entity201 wrote			0
" the disappearance of a man , or of a woman of color , can generate a brief flurry , but never the full damsel treatment			2
" similar comments were made in @entity236 , after the bodies of 11 black women were found in a " house of horrors " in 2009			1
" in all their coverage , sympathetic as it may be , the [ @entity236 ] @entity241 never raises the bigger issue			0
what made these women such easy targets was being black , being women and being from the highly segregated and desperately poor east side of @entity236 , " @entity245 , founding editor of @entity246 , wrote a year after the bodies were discovered			2
" nobody was going to tear up the city looking for a few black women from the east side with sketchy pasts			2
" justice for everyone ? @entity10 grew up in and around @entity0 one of three siblings			1
her parents separated , and when @entity85 married @entity104 about 12 years ago , he embraced her as his own			2
@entity104 never had much contact with his own daughter from a previous relationship ; @entity3 filled that void			1
he loved to hear her call him " @entity267			0
" @entity104 adjusts the baseball cap hugging his head			0
" relax , " it says			0
" @entity271 is in control			0
" but he is far from relaxed talking about @entity3			1
@entity85 decided she had had enough of journalists after @entity61 's case made the news			1
she had agreed to speak with me but changed her mind			0
she makes it clear she 's upset her daughter 's name has been dredged up again			2
she tells her husband to " keep it short			0
" but @entity284 wants to talk			0
he wants to keep @entity3 's memory alive			1
at a vigil last year organized by " @entity288 , " a group started by @entity7 's parents , @entity104 spoke publicly about @entity3			1
" she was loved , " he told the crowd , among them the families of nine @entity1 women whose cases remain unresolved			1
@entity104 says his stepdaughter was n't perfect			2
she had fallen in and out of trouble , moved from one home to another			0
she was arrested in 2005 for theft			0
the photo that was used in newspapers and television when she went missing was , ironically , a police mug shot			1
she dabbled with drugs and men , @entity284 says			0
she got pregnant and gave birth to two daughters			0
she was supposed to check into a rehabilitation facility two days after she went missing			2
she did not fit the picture of the all - american girl next door			0
but that , says her family , does n't mean she should go without justice			0
authorities have not said anything about the evidence they have on @entity57			0
@entity3 's family has no idea whether she , @entity8 and @entity7 are linked in some chilling way			1
they know only this : for the first time in years , they harbor hope again of learning the truth , however brutal that might be .			0

almost five years after her body was found , @entity3 's name is in the news again
police are investigating if there is a connection between @entity10 and a suspect in other cases
@entity10 's death was overshadowed by the disappearance of @entity7
@entity10 's stepfather says @entity3 did n't fit the profile of missing women who make headlines
