@entity1 sen. @entity0 is floating an unexpected option to take over for outgoing defense secretary @entity3 : former sen. @entity4 , a former @entity5 turned @entity6 from @entity7			1
in a statement issued hours after president @entity9 appeared at the @entity10 alongside @entity11 to announce the end of his tenure , @entity0 slammed the president over the resignation and suggested @entity4 as a potential replacement			1
" today 's resignation reflects the ongoing damage caused by president @entity9 's misguided foreign policy of leading from behind , " @entity0 said			0
" one strong option would be former sen. @entity4 , a member of the president 's own party with deep experience and unshakable commitment to the security of the @entity26			2
i urge the president to give him full and fair consideration for this critical position			0
" as a close friend of @entity32 @entity31 sen. @entity31 , the incoming @entity33 chairman , @entity4 would likely win easy approval from the committee if considered			2
opinion : pushing out @entity11 not shake - up @entity9 needs but his name has n't been included on any shortlists in part because his hawkish foreign policy views have often put him at odds with @entity43			2
he also was a rare @entity5 to endorse @entity31 over @entity9 for president in 2008 , and was believed to be one of @entity31 's preferred vp options			0
@entity10 officials have named former top @entity51 officials @entity49 and @entity52 , as well as @entity54 @entity43 sen. @entity53 as possible nominees , though @entity53 's spokesman has indicated he 's not interested in the post			1
@entity0 has urged his party to block most of @entity9 's executive and judicial nominees when they take control of the @entity62 next year as a response to the president 's executive action on deportations			0
but in his statement , he set that conflict aside and called for the @entity62 to " promptly confirm a strong and qualified nominee " to replace @entity11 because secretary of defense is , " by any measure ... a vital national security position			1
" was @entity11 doomed from the start ?			0

sen. @entity0 suggested former sen. @entity4 , a @entity5 turned *independent* , to replace @entity11
@entity4 has n't been named by @entity10 officials on the shortlist of potential nominees
@entity0 called for the nominee to be confirmed " promptly "
