@entity0 -- faced with a divided public over his signature legislative achievement , president @entity4 on wednesday hailed the health care reform bill passed in march as important for helping both the government and the @entity8 people deal with rising medical costs			1
the measure endured a bitter political fight that saw no @entity12 vote for its final approval , and recent polls show it remains controversial as @entity16 face congressional elections in november amid a tough climate due to lingering economic woes			2
@entity4 , at a carefully orchestrated meeting with people who have benefited from health care reform , told them that their stories are the best way to counter what one participant called " misinformation " spread by opponents of the measure			1
" we are now actually able to provide some help to the @entity8 people , " @entity4 said , noting new provisions under the bill that take effect thursday -- the six - month anniversary of the day he signed it into law			1
the new provisions will end lifetime limits on coverage ; ensure coverage of children with pre-existing medical conditions ; allow parents to keep children on their policies until the age of 26 ; halt the practice of rescission , in which insurance companies drop coverage for arbitrary reasons ; and cover preventive health practices , @entity4 said			1
responding to a @entity12 argument that the health care bill represents a government takeover of health care , @entity4 said the bill 's provisions are instead " designed to make sure you 're getting what you paid for			1
" @entity16 had planned to tout the health care bill 's passage in their campaigns for the november 2 election , but some are backing off because of some people 's continued negative perceptions			1
according to a @entity75 / @entity74 survey conducted this month , almost half of respondents said they did not approve of the measure while 37 percent said they approved			0
a @entity79 national poll conducted in early september indicated that 46 percent of the public says that @entity16 in @entity81 will do a better job on health care , while 45 percent say congressional republicans will do a better job on the issue			1
@entity12 leaders are calling for the measure to be repealed , or at least diminished , if their party wins control of @entity81 in november			2
they say it will increase health care costs for businesses and individuals , hurting the economy			1
a group of @entity97 who are doctors said later wednesday that some of the new benefits cited by @entity4 are good , but the measure still should be repealed			1
" these are the kind of things that the @entity8 people understand , " said rep. @entity102 , @entity103 , adding that such benefits did n't need " a 2,400 - page bill " to enact them			2
" when we go back and repeal , we will keep these things , " @entity102 said			0
@entity4 repeated arguments from the debate over the bill , saying how the non-partisan @entity115 predicted the reforms would eventually reduce the government burden for health care costs by up to $ 1 trillion			1
he noted how the plan also helps senior citizens with prescription drug costs , first by a $ 250 check paid this year and later by eliminating a current gap in coverage			0
@entity4 's appearance was intended to highlight how the reforms have directly helped @entity8 families			2
held in the back yard of a @entity131 home , it featured people from all over the country provided microphones to relate their experiences and ask questions			0
@entity137 of @entity138 , @entity139 , told how she had no health coverage when diagnosed in march with high grade @entity142 's lymphoma , a form of cancer			0
because of the health reform law , she put off treatment until july , when insurance companies were banned from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions , she said			2
now she feels great , she said , thanking @entity4 because " if it was n't for this bill , i probably would not have been feeling great because i would have been so stressed out worrying about how we would pay for my medical bills			2
" @entity4 mentioned the call by @entity157 minority leader @entity156 , @entity158 , to repeal the health care bill and said @entity156 should have to look @entity137 in the eye and tell her , " sorry , @entity137 , you ca n't afford health insurance			1
" " i do n't think that 's what this country stands for , " @entity4 said			2
he emphasized how the health care bill helps small businesses by providing tax breaks to those that provide coverage to their workers			1
two of the participants backed him up by saying that before the bill , they faced the choice of either dropping coverage for their workers or going out of business			0
@entity180 , who runs the @entity183 's @entity182 book store in @entity184 , @entity185 , said the bill " makes a massive difference in the state of our business " and asked what could be done about the misinformation against the bill			0
@entity192 of @entity193 , @entity194 , said health care premiums for his 14 workers doubled over the last seven years , but the tax credits now lowered the cost to 2008 levels			1
" that 's like a time machine in terms of our premiums , " @entity192 said , adding it would allow him to keep providing coverage for his employees			0
another woman told how she was able to get coverage for her young son despite a serious eye condition			0
@entity211 of @entity212 , @entity213 , remembered being shocked when she realized the insurance company could no longer deny coverage due to a pre-existing condition			0
" i said , ' wow , something affected me personally from the government , " @entity211 said			0
" thank you and everyone for pushing this through			0
" @entity4 concluded the gathering by telling how his daughter @entity222 contracted meningitis when 3 months old , and his feeling of desperation as she was hospitalized and he wondered how he could have paid for it without health insurance			1
" that 's what this is about , " he said , adding : " ultimately , the thing that 's most important is we 've just got to give people some basic peace of mind			0
" before the event , @entity4 met with state insurance commissioners to discuss how the bill was affecting their work and the ability of states to deal with the changes			1
some noted that meeting timelines for changes in the legislation would cost states significant resources , while the commissioner from @entity250 cited a benefit			0
policies carrying excess contract reserves have been renegotiated at lower rates , bringing cost savings to participants , said the official , @entity257			0
@entity1 's @entity258 and @entity259 contributed to this story .			0
