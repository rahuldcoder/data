it 's going to be hours before the airline can get you on another flight			2

you surf the web for a while			0
this is taking way too long			0

airlines are ramping up their use of social networking sites			1
several have one employee in the communications department whose primary job is to monitor what is being said about them and to create a presence in the world of @entity14 and @entity37			1

" promotions clearly work well , but there is also an opportunity for airlines to improve customer service and brand perception , " @entity44 , editor - in - chief of social media guide @entity46 and a commentator on social networking sites , wrote in an e-mail interview			1
" if you 're stuck at an airport , and it 's the airline 's fault , you 're going to tweet about it			0
if the airline responds to those tweets in a positive fashion , it at least shows they care , even if they ca n't immediately remedy the issue			0
" @entity17 has embraced @entity14 as both a medium to update the public on its latest news and a sounding board for how the airline is doing			1
the airline has more than 1 million followers on @entity14 and it also follows about 120,000 of those tweeters			1
" the tricky thing with following people is that you do n't want to creep anyone out , " said @entity74 , senior analyst of corporate communications at @entity17			0
" you do n't want to look like you are stalking them just because they are talking about us			0

it has been increasing its use of the site by adding modules , including a yet - to - be - named feature that helps users find fares			2
" we still have a lot to learn from customers and from how customers interact in these mediums , " he said			0
" but it has worked because we have been able to do targeted promotions to consumers , and because we have been able to get feedback from consumers , and in a very easy way			2
" not to mention an inexpensive way			0
@entity46 's @entity44 said social media is still a small part of most marketing budgets ( not only for airlines but for many companies ) but it is attractive because the costs are minimal			1
" it also can be essentially cost - free to get started , since all one needs to do is open a @entity37 , @entity14 or @entity140 account and get creative , " @entity44 said			1
" in a down economy , the low cost of entry certainly makes social media even more attractive than it might have already been otherwise			1
" as for the unfavorable comments people post , @entity99 ' @entity101 says it can be a chance to turn a negative experience into something positive			1
he thinks it can be good for customers to use the forum to get something off their chest			0
the airline looks for opportunities to interact with users			2
