-- a new variation of bird flu that the @entity3 says has caused at least 11 deaths in @entity5 has genetic characteristics that make it well - adapted to infect people			1
in a report published late thursday in the @entity10 , samples from three patients -- all of whom died -- had mutations that have previously been shown to increase transmissibility , and to help the virus grow in a mammal 's respiratory tract			1
the analysis comes amid a modest but steady stream of human cases since the end of march			1
saturday , @entity5 reported a 7 - year - old @entity25 girl is the latest person to become infected with the @entity27 flu strain , bringing the total to 44			1
the strain is normally found in birds , and until last month was never known to infect people			1
" the @entity27 situation is evolving very quickly , " said @entity32 , director of the @entity33 at the @entity34			1
" one thing of concern is the pace at which we are seeing the identification of cases			2
" another death in @entity5 bird flu crisis as @entity44 goes on alert on a more reassuring note , investigators have found no evidence that the virus has passed directly from person to person			1
more than a thousand " close contacts " of the patients are being monitored by @entity5 health officials , according to the @entity3			1
one concerning mutation , known as " @entity56 , " was found in two of the first three victims			0
past experiments have shown it to make viruses -- including the @entity63 bird flu virus -- more likely to infect ferrets , which are commonly used in flu research			1
the same mutation was also found in the viruses that caused the 1957 and 1968 flu pandemics			1
a second mutation , known as " @entity70 , " was found in all three virus samples			2
according to dr. @entity73 , a @entity74 virologist , this mutation allows the virus to reproduce at much lower temperatures than a standard avian influenza virus			0
the change lets it grow in a human respiratory tract , which is cooler than the virus ' natural home : a bird 's gastrointestinal tract			1
in mice , @entity73 said , the mutation makes the infection as much as 1,000 times more virulent			0
a number of other mutations were found as well , including changes that are characteristic of viruses found in mammals			2
@entity5 's bird flu mystery " known normal bird viruses have to adapt substantially to infect people , but not these , " said @entity73 , who said the changes are enough that he would no longer call the @entity27 strain " bird flu			1
" the first three patients to be identified are an 87 - year - old man and a 27 - year - old man from @entity101 , and a 35 - year - old housewife from @entity103			0
the woman had visited a chicken market about a week before falling ill. the younger man was a butcher who worked in a market where live birds were sold , although he did not butcher any birds			0
the 87 - year - old had no known exposure to live birds			0
all three died after suffering severe respiratory symptoms , including acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventually septic shock and multiple organ failure			0
in a commentary that ran with the article , @entity32 and dr. @entity116 , a physician with the @entity34 , noted that patients were not given antiviral medication until their illness became severe			0
@entity123 ( @entity123 ) or zanamivir ( @entity124 ) should be administered as soon as possible to patients with a suspected or confirmed @entity27 infection , the two wrote			2
@entity32 said it remains unclear whether the severe illnesses are typical of @entity27 infection or simply the tip of a large iceberg in which a large number of mild cases are going unnoticed			1
" as surveillance has expanded , we 're also seeing individuals with milder cases , " said @entity32			0
" we 're still seeing very severe disease in some cases , but overall i think it 's somewhat reassuring			0
" the @entity34 is in the final steps of refining a diagnostic test to identify @entity27 in patients , and @entity32 said it should be available for distribution in a matter of days			2
a widely available diagnostic test would allow faster identification of patients who actually have the infection , and would also help disease detectives zero in on how people are being exposed			0
work has begun on a vaccine , although @entity32 and others said that even if it is eventually needed , a vaccine likely wo n't be available for several months			0
while the overall picture is concerning , flu experts urged calm			2
" i would n't say a pandemic is more likely than it was a year ago , " @entity73 said			0
" the only thing we can do as virologists right now is to point out the interesting characteristics of the virus , try to get to the bottom of this story and try to stop further infections			0

a new bird flu variation has caused 11 deaths in @entity5
the @entity27 flu strain is *responsible* for 44 human cases
experts are concerned by some of the virus mutations found
