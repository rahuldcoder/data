-- in the third grade , @entity1 was so overweight his mom had to take him to the men 's store to buy his @entity7 suit			1
" even back then , i absolutely loved clothes , " @entity1 said			1
" that 's what really keeps me honest with all this weight loss			1
i want to go to the mall to buy more than socks			2
" at his heaviest he weighed 405 pounds			1
now the 5 - foot - 11 - inch associate director of student conduct at @entity17 in @entity18 weighs 160 pounds			1
since january 2011 , he 's lost 245 pounds , or the equivalent of a gas stove			1
he says anyone can do it his way : without surgery or a special diet program " i always tell people it 's the three p 's : persistence , passion and perseverance , " @entity1 said			1
the turning point came when the 34 - year - old watched his wife tear up during " @entity34			2
" " she told me she loved me , but she worried that i was n't going to be around long because of my weight , " @entity1 said			1
" i had to do something			2
" @entity1 had been heavy all his life			1
growing up , none of the adults in his family ever talked to him about healthy eating			2
they did n't have to , he says			2
" my mom used to joke my dad would get kicked out of buffets , he had such a great appetite and such a great metabolism			2
he never had to work to be small , " @entity1 said			1
" my mom was never bigger than a size 6			2
" his mom tried to set a good example with daily exercise			2
" she was the person who got up and did her @entity56 video every morning , " @entity1 said			1
but he was an only child , and everyone in his family showed their love with food			1
his grandmother , especially , doted on him			2
" she would take me to @entity62 's nearly every day , " @entity1 said			1
" i did love a big cheeseburger and fries , and i never met a sweet i did n't like			2
" he was n't much into sports or exercising either			2
" i never learned to swim at camp because i 'd get ear aches , " @entity1 said			1
" i remember playing kickball in second grade and broke my pinky finger			2
and from there on out , when they 'd ask me to play , i 'd say , ' nope , i 'm good			2
' " as he steadily gained weight , @entity1 said he was lucky that the kids did n't bully him about it			1
" i 've always had a great sense of humor and can deflect the attention from my being obese , " @entity1 said			1
that sense of humor also got him in trouble			2
while attending an all - boys catholic school in @entity84 known for its orderly discipline , he served a lot of time in detention			0
but being the class clown also paid off with fast friendships			0
" i 'm lucky ; people have always been nice , or at least they try to be , " @entity1 said			1
" people would often give me a back - handed compliment like ' you 're handsome for a fat kid			0
' " he met his wife , @entity95 , at a fraternity function in 2004			0
they were in graduate school at the time			0
they married two years later			0
soon after he watched her tear up over " @entity34 , " he cut himself trying to force a zipper closed on a pair of pants that were too tight			0
that 's when he finally decided he had enough			0
he had to lose weight , and he wanted to do it in a way that would stick			2
rather than cut out all bad food , he gradually reduced the amount he was eating			1
" i loved fried chicken , so i decided i would eat six pieces instead of eight , " @entity1 said			1
" then i 'd reduce it further to four pieces , and then eventually dropped fried chicken all together			0
i ate meat more like it was a protein condiment			0
now i do n't eat any meat at all			0
i 'm a dedicated vegan			0
" @entity1 said he is " hyper vigilant " about what he eats now			1
he 'll start the day with a protein shake before he heads off to the gym in the morning			0
after he works out , he eats oatmeal with apple slices			0
lunch is vegetarian chili with a salad and more vegetables such as @entity129 sprouts , broccoli or corn on the cob			0
dinner is often popcorn , with an occasional smoothie for dessert			0
" by now this kind of eating is a habit -- so much so that when i went to visit a friend in @entity140 , i packed my popcorn and chili and ate it on my layover in @entity144 , " @entity1 said			1
he breaks from routine every once in awhile , though			0
" in may i turned 34 and decided to splurge , " @entity1 said			1

@entity1 stays focused with the help of a coach , @entity158 , ceo of @entity159			1
@entity158 lives in @entity160 , so all their sessions are virtual			0
@entity1 finds their sessions particularly effective			1
" he gives me positive encouragement and tough love			0
i remember one time he said , ' your motivation is n't where it once was			0
' that 's all i needed to hear			0
when i went to the gym that day i told my wife drop me off further away -- i need the walk			0
