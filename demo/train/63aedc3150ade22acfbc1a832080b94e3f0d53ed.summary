@entity7 needs funds to shore up its struggling banking sector and buttress the government , which has poured billions into saving the banks			2
fears about @entity7 have pushed down the value of the euro against the dollar and put stock markets under pressure			0
but the request for help is unpopular in @entity7 , and the government could be punished thursday when there is an election to fill an empty seat in parliament			2

" the @entity4 managing director @entity96 said , in a news release , that the international finance institution " stands ready to join this effort , including through a multi-year loan			2
" @entity101 had long publicly insisted it would not seek an external bailout , despite widespread concerns that a ballooning budget deficit and wobbly banking sector would further cripple the @entity7 economy			0
yet a possible loan package was front - and - center during talks this week of @entity3 financial ministers			2
and officials from the @entity80 , the @entity81 and the @entity4 have been meeting officials from @entity7 's @entity113 and the @entity114 since thursday , hashing out measures required to bring stability to the @entity7 banking system			1
those negotiations now continue to determine the extent and guidelines for any aid package , according to @entity33 , who said he expects a deal to be finalized " in the next few weeks			0
" at sunday night 's press conference in @entity101 , which followed a meeting of @entity33 's cabinet , @entity74 said the country would ask for less than 100 billion euros from the @entity35 and the @entity4			1

" these [ cuts ] will be difficult for everyone			0
" in part to meet its loan requirements , @entity101 also will set out a comprehensive four - year plan detailing its deficit - reduction and other measures to shore up the @entity7 economy , according to @entity33			0
he said that while corporate tax rates would stay unchanged , income tax levels would rise to 2006 levels			0
in addition , @entity33 said he 'd push new policies that would make @entity7 banks " significantly smaller than they have been in the past ... so they can be brought on their feet			0
" @entity7 shares the euro with 15 other @entity3 nations , and its perilous financial situations has raised concerns about a trickle - down effect on the common currency and the wider @entity35			2
responding to questions that a large outside loan might threaten @entity7 's sovereignty , @entity33 said @entity7 's economy was already tightly tied into @entity3 's and said " support ... from our partners " encouraged him to support asking for their assistance			1
" our membership in the @entity35 has transformed our country for the better , " the prime minister said			0
" [ @entity175 ] the task of rebuilding our economy falls to our own ... people			0
