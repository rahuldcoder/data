-- a federal judge wants to see secret videotapes showing terror suspects forcibly removed from their cells at the @entity6 military prison			1
the sharply worded order from judge @entity8 , of the @entity9 , was issued late wednesday in a lawsuit brought by relatives of @entity13 inmates being held at the overseas facility in @entity15			1
at issue is whether the @entity17 can withhold these kinds of government records -- including various media material -- that would be an invasion of privacy , or involve " internal rules and practices of an agency			0
" the defendants in a lawsuit demanded access under a @entity30 request , claiming military guards have been mistreating the four prisoners , including the alleged " forced cell extractions " ( @entity34 )			0
after three previous orders to speed up delivery of the material or justify withholding it , the judge appeared miffed at the government 's latest efforts to hinder release of the 45 videotapes and one audiotape in question			1
a previous " last chance " admonition by the judge apparently was not met by the @entity48			1
" @entity50 to ' correct ' or supplement its prior submissions have resulted in further obfuscation , " said @entity8 , who said he now needs to see the disputed tapes for himself			2
" the written ( descriptive ) submissions provided by the @entity48 simply do not allow the court meaningfully to assess whether the claimed exemptions actually apply			0
" federal officials had said access to the tapes by the plaintiffs or to the public at large would violate the privacy , and perhaps endanger the safety , of the @entity64 guards seen removing the foreign prisoners			2
but the court was skeptical such exemptions would apply			0
" no argument has been made here that the videos relate to ' issues of employee relations and human resources ' nor would such an argument be viable based on the record currently before the court , " wrote @entity8 , who was nominated by former president @entity68 just a week before the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks			2
" the court will order that a representative sample of the videorecordings be produced " for review by the judge in private , in his chambers			1
@entity8 would then have the discretion to turn over the material to the defense , which could later be presented at any trial			0
the current lawsuit was filed four years ago , and is one of several brought by @entity6 detainees over their treatment and continued custody without charges or trial			1
the case is @entity97 v. @entity64 @entity17 ( cv - 08 - 1063 ) .			0
