near @entity0 , @entity1 -- fifty years ago , 15 - year - old @entity3 knew a secret that governments around the world would have killed to learn or safeguard : @entity8 troops were building hidden military installations in @entity1			1
one of those installations was on the farm where his family raised chickens and pigs			1
in 1962 , @entity17 's revolution was just beginning to reshape @entity1			1

" our life was getting up every day to take the livestock out to pasture , " @entity3 remembers a half - century later			0
" we watched them , worked , did our chores and went to sleep to do it again the next day			0
" that routine was interrupted when @entity3 and his father , @entity37 , returned to their farmhouse one day to find a uniformed @entity1 comandante waiting for them on the porch			1

" it was n't right , but this was a time of war and they needed for us to move and would give us a bigger farm and build us a new house			2
" seventy - two hours later , @entity3 said , a house had been built for them , no small feat in a country beset by shortages			2
@entity3 , his brother and parents left their farm with all their animals and earthly possessions			2
" as we drove out , " he said , " the troops started coming in			0
" read more : should the @entity21 raise a fist or offer a hand to @entity1 ?

on his family 's new farm two miles away , @entity3 might not have ever known that a large military operation was under way where they once lived -- if not for the pigs			1
the @entity3 family 's pigs kept wandering back to the old farm			1
@entity3 was dispatched to bring them home			0
sneaking past the @entity1 guards , @entity3 said , he encountered tall , blond visitors who had commandeered his wayward porkers			1
" they ate our pigs , " @entity3 said			2

they flew over that mountain range , came down and then flew out , " @entity3 said			0
" that 's when you saw a lot of movement among the @entity1 troops			2
" the planes @entity3 saw were @entity21 spy planes , and as they flew over @entity0 on october 15 , 1962 , they were capturing the first photos of @entity8 nuclear missiles in @entity1			1
those photos arrived on president @entity132 's desk the next morning			0
more spy flights revealed @entity8 installations across the island and nuclear missiles that could reach the @entity21 @entity136			1

but even though he lived next to a missile site , @entity153 was n't aware at the time that a crisis by any name was taking place			0
" back then , we did n't have tv , " @entity3 said of simple life in @entity1 's countryside			2
" we did n't get the news , no one delivered the paper			0
back then , you were considered rich if you had a radio			0
we had no idea what was going on			0
" @entity3 said they never heard of the crisis while it unfolded or that a deal was reached between the @entity21 and @entity8 to remove the missiles if the @entity21 promised not to invade @entity1			1
he does remember the loud noise of trucks hauling the @entity8 equipment from their farm			1
after the mysterious visitors left , @entity3 said he and his father returned to their old land			2
concrete bunkers now stood where livestock had grazed			2
the new land they had been given was four times the size of the old -- and now damaged -- farm			0
still , @entity3 's father went to see the comandante to ask for his farm back			0
opinion : the hypocrisy of @entity21 's @entity1 policy " the comandante said , ' if i gave you a bigger farm , why do you want to go to a smaller one ? ' " @entity3 related			1
" my dad responded , ' you gave me a bigger farm , but that 's not my farm , " @entity3 said			0
" my farm is the little one , and that 's where i want go back to			0
" @entity3 's family still works the land where @entity8 troops once erected nuclear missile sites			1
when @entity3 , 65 , is not tending to the animals , he takes the occasional visitor out to see the traces of the @entity8 occupation of his farm			1
the road the @entity103 used to transport the missiles washed away a long time ago and the quickest way to reach the missile sites is by mule and buggy			0
on the day he took @entity2 out to see the ruins of the missile sites , @entity3 sported a @entity225 baseball cap and apologized that he had to borrow his neighbor 's smaller cart since his had a flat tire			0
driving out , @entity3 pointed out a fence he made from a metal bridge the @entity8 left behind			2
he also showed how neighbors used curved concrete beams from a missile bunker to build a pig pen			0

a small , faded marble plaque marked the spot where @entity8 once pointed nuclear missiles at the @entity21			1
@entity3 said the marble plaque was a replacement for a bronze one that disappeared years ago			0
the loudest sound at the remote site was the wind rustling though the adjacent sugar cane fields			0
" we were lucky there was n't war , " @entity3 said			0
" after the atomic bombs and the sicknesses that would have come , there would n't have been a single @entity1 left and there would n't have been many of you left either because you are very close			2
