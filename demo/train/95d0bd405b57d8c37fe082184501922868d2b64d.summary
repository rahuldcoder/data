@entity1 with an unrestricted , panoramic night view of the city 's twinkling skyline and the breezy air right outside the front door , a 15th floor penthouse apartment ticks all the boxes for a million - dollar property in the heart of @entity1			1
but there 's a catch			2
@entity13 , 59 , who prefers not to divulge his full name , lives in an illegal rooftop slum -- a 75 - square - feet shack just big enough to host a bed , a cupboard , and everyday knick - knacks thrown pell - mell in the dusty room			1
the rent costs $ 1,700 @entity1 dollars ( us $ 220 ) a month			1
local authorities have been taping eviction notices on his front door for the past month , saying that he has to move out			0
but with high property prices and hundreds of thousands waiting for public housing in @entity1 , @entity13 , has no other places to go			1
" i wo n't accept the relocation settlement scheme -- it 's only a few thousand @entity1 dollars			1
where am i going to live ? the rent is a lot cheaper here , " he says as he crumples the latest notice			2
the authorities offer a relocation settlement for rooftop residents , to @entity43 -- it is too meager			2
most people in his position do n't have a stable income to start again elsewhere			2
the rooftop slums in @entity1 expose one of the most bewildering facets of @entity53 's self - described " world city			1
" majestic skyscrapers loom over peeling , overcrowded apartment blocks with their unofficial rooftop extensions			2
clearing out constructed on top of buildings since the 1950s and 60s without government approval , these makeshift communities clutter the rooftops in old working - class neighborhoods such as @entity64			0
corrugated metal sheets roughly cover concrete - walled shacks			0
and they 've provided vital accommodations for low - income people such as migrants from mainland @entity71 and @entity53 for more than half a century			0
according to the latest figures from @entity1 's @entity74 , there were 3,747 rooftop dwellers in 1,588 households in 2011			1
this is a dramatic drop from 2001 when more than 16,000 people lived illegally in these sky slums			1
the decrease marks a trend where tenement buildings -- under constant pressure due to the shortage of land in @entity1 -- are torn down to pave way for brand new shopping and residential developments			2

atop an industrial building that houses textile and publishing companies , @entity13 and around 40 other residents navigate their way through dark and haphazardly boarded walkways , occasionally lit up by an overhanging light bulb , or the glowing screen of a smartphone			0
tangled electric wires that also double as laundry lines , criss - cross from one end of the roof to the other			0
an open square lies in the middle , scattered with pieces of unwanted furniture , flower boxes and kids ' toys , which strangely bring color and cheer to the crowded space			0
@entity13 works mostly in the construction sector and earns around $ 8,000 @entity1 dollars ( us $ 1,000 ) a month , barely enough to take care of his 10 - year - old daughter and to cover the rent			2
" i used to own property in @entity131 , but i moved back to @entity1 four years ago so my daughter can have a better education here , " @entity13 said , as his neighbors trickled out to join the conversation			1
they have all received the same warning from the government			0
some have lived on this rooftop for more than 10 years and see no alternative but to stay			0
the rooftop dwellers are willing to open the doors to their humble homes but will only talk off the record -- in fear of being resettled to remote satellite towns , where there may be few opportunities and limited social networks			1
a few buildings away from where @entity13 lives , @entity148 , who is a student at the @entity150 school of professional and @entity151 , says she prefers to live in the rooftop huts			2
she lives with her single mother and brother in a 236 - square - feet flat			0
" the space here is a lot bigger than the subdivided flats			0
it was a little bit uncomfortable at first with all the rats and the cockroaches , but we learn to adapt , " the 21 - year - old says			0
" the only thing is that it gets really hot during the summer			0
" the rooftop slums in the neighborhood are unofficially rented out by the building 's top floor owners who want to earn some cash on the side , according to @entity13			1
for @entity174 's mother , she says she has no idea who she 's been paying her rent to for the past three years			0
" i just put the money in an envelope that comes every month on time and that is it , " says @entity178			0
widening wealth gap the housing crunch highlights the widening economic divide for the city of seven million residents			1
" the reality is that a part of @entity1 society 's income is not increasing , while the rich are getting richer , " says economist @entity187			1
@entity193 last year registered 45 billionaires in @entity1 with a combined wealth of @entity196 $ 214 billion -- almost 80 % of @entity1 's gdp in 2013			1
in contrast , there are 400,000 households living under the poverty line , which is set at $ 14,300 @entity1 dollars ( us $ 1,800 ) for a house of four			2
a survey published in early 2014 by @entity204 revealed that @entity1 's property market has become the world 's most expensive , with the median housing price reaching $ 4,024,000 @entity1 dollars , or us $ 519,216			1
the hike in property prices signifies a thriving economy in @entity1 , and construction jobs have been on the rise to meet the housing demand			1
they provide increasing job opportunities for people like @entity13 who work in the sector , but their financial struggles suggest that little of the money generated from the construction boom trickles down into their pockets			0

" i hope we can move into public housing after living here for seven years , but the wait will be long			0
" when construction worker @entity13 was asked about his future plans after his imminent eviction , he just chuckled			0
" i 'll think about that when they really come and tear this down			0
if i can live here for one more day , i 'll continue to stay here			0
