-- it may not have had the table topping tension of recent @entity5 clashes but the old quality certainly remained as @entity7 overcame @entity8 in a pulsating match at the @entity10 saturday			1
@entity11 gave @entity8 the lead going into the break before a sweeping strike from @entity15 and a late @entity17 penalty swung the match in @entity7 's favour			1
the win marks the first time @entity22 's men have triumphed against @entity8 at home since 2010 and preserves their unbeaten start to the @entity26 season			1
@entity8 , meanwhile , remain third bottom of the table , a remarkable fact given their domestic success and @entity32 form of recent years			1
that there was a 14 - place gap between these two teams was far from clear through much of this match , however			0
both sides created chances in a high - quality first half that could have ended 3 - 3 let alone 1 - 0			1
@entity40 was given early work to do as he beat away a vicious @entity17 shot with five minutes on the clock			1
@entity43 then cracked a post for @entity8 shortly after before a spectacular scissors kick from @entity46 was dealt with by @entity40			2
the speedy @entity47 was denied by @entity7 keeper @entity48 just after the half hour mark when put through by @entity50 -- but @entity8 did n't have to wait long to make the breakthrough			1
on the very next attack , the dangerous @entity52 broke down the right and delivered an inch perfect cross that was nodded home by @entity11			2
the @entity58 international has been heavily linked with a move to @entity7 next summer but showed little regard for his potential future employers here , setting the tempo for @entity8 's rapier counter attacks			1
but @entity7 under @entity22 are n't used to losing , let alone losing in their own stadium			2
the second half began with the @entity68 swarming all over their @entity8 , pressing in packs -- as is the hallmark of @entity22 teams -- and pushing their opponents ever deeper into their own territory			2
@entity74 was forced into action to deny @entity15 with a fine save while @entity17 and @entity76 both let fly with dangerous long distance strikes			1
defender @entity78 then missed a golden opportunity when he headed wide from six yards out			0
but @entity81 international , @entity15 , would not be denied after 70 minutes			2
the @entity83 man was the first to react to a loose ball that broke against @entity8 defender @entity85 and he fired low beyond the diving @entity40 who had yet to fully set himself			2
@entity7 were now clearly in the ascendancy with @entity8 looking tired and offering little going forward			1
as full time approached substitute @entity87 burst into the @entity8 penalty area where he was pulled back by the chasing @entity85			2
the @entity90 vociferously claimed his innocence but referee @entity92 had no doubts and pointed to the spot			0
@entity17 stepped up and calmly placed the ball low into the bottom left hand corner , sending @entity40 the wrong way in the process and ensuring his side would claim the spoils			0
@entity101 @entity103 's stuttering start to the season continued away to a resurgent @entity105 saturday			0
@entity106 scored the only goal in closely fought 1 - 0 victory to give @entity110 's men their third win in the space of six days			0
table topping @entity114 , meanwhile , rallied to defeat @entity115 2 - 1 at @entity116 thanks to a late @entity118 penalty			1
surprise package @entity119 continued their fine start to the season with a 1 - 0 win away to @entity124 while @entity125 ran out comfortable 3 - 0 winners at home to @entity128			0

@entity162 , meanwhile , was looking for one goal to equal the all - time @entity140 goalscoring record held by @entity165 but the @entity168 's @entity167 side were upset by @entity169 who left the @entity171 with a surprise 1 - 0 victory			0
@entity174 scored the games only goal early in the second half			0
@entity178 @entity179 moved clear at the top of @entity178 after triumphing 2 - 0 away to @entity181 thanks to second half goals from @entity183 and @entity184			1
a 2 - 0 defeat for @entity186 away to @entity187 earlier in the day means the @entity179 now sit three points clear at the top of the table			1
