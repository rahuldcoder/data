-- gas prices approaching $ 4 a gallon on average are causing severe economic pain for millions of @entity5			1
pump prices spiked 5 % in the past month alone			1
crude oil prices stood at $ 108 on friday , up from only double digits at the beginning of the month			1
what 's the cause ? forget what you may have read about the laws of supply and demand			1
oil and gas prices have almost nothing to do with economic fundamentals			1
according to the @entity23 , the supply of oil and gasoline is higher today than it was three years ago , when the national average for a gallon of gasoline was just $ 1.90			1
meanwhile , the demand for oil in the @entity5 is at its lowest level since april of 1997			1
is @entity30 to blame ? sure			0
big oil companies have been gouging consumers for years			2
they have made almost $ 1 trillion in profits over the past decade , in part thanks to ridiculous federal subsidies and tax loopholes			2
i have proposed legislation to end those pointless giveaways to some of the biggest and most profitable corporations in the history of the world			0
but there 's another reason for the wild rise in gas prices			1
speculators are raking in profits by gambling in the loosely regulated commodity markets for gas and oil			1
a decade ago , speculators controlled only about 30 % of the oil futures market			1
today , @entity50 speculators control nearly 80 % of this market			1
many of those people buying and selling oil in the commodity markets will never use a drop of this oil			2
they are not airlines or trucking companies who will use the fuel in the future			0
the only function of the speculators in this process is to make as much money as they can , as quickly as they can			2
i 've seen the raw documents that prove the role of speculators			2
@entity82 records showed that in the summer of 2008 , when gas prices spiked to more than $ 4 a gallon , speculators overwhelmingly controlled the crude oil futures market			1
the commission , which supposedly represents the interests of the @entity5 people , had kept the information hidden from the public for nearly three years			1
that alone is an outrage			0
the @entity5 people had a right to know exactly who caused gas prices to skyrocket in 2008 and who is causing them to spike today			1
even those inside the oil industry have admitted that speculation is driving up the price of gasoline			0
the ceo of @entity103 , @entity104 , told a @entity106 hearing last year that speculation was driving up the price of a barrel of oil by as much as 40 %			2
the general counsel of @entity112 , @entity113 , and the experts at @entity115 also said excessive speculation is causing oil prices to spike by up to 40 %			1
even @entity118 , the largest exporter of oil in the world , told the @entity123 administration back in 2008 , during the last major spike in oil prices , that speculation was responsible for about $ 40 of a barrel of oil			2
just last week , commissioner @entity129 , one of the only @entity82 members looking out for consumers , calculated how much extra drivers are being charged as a result of @entity50 speculation			0
if you drive a relatively fuel - efficient vehicle such as a @entity137 , you pay an extra $ 7.30 every time you fill your tank			0
for larger vehicles , such as a @entity140 , drivers pay an extra $ 14.56 for each fill - up			0
that works out to more than $ 750 a year going directly from your wallet or pocketbook to the @entity50 speculators			0
so as speculators gamble , millions of @entity5 are paying what amounts to a " speculators tax " to feed @entity50 's greed			1
people who live in rural areas like my home state of @entity154 are hit harder than most because they buy gas to drive long distances to their jobs			0
it does n't have to work this way			0
the current spike in oil and gasoline prices was avoidable			2
under the @entity50 reform act that @entity164 passed in 2010 , the @entity82 was ordered to impose strict limits on the amount of oil that @entity50 speculators could trade in the energy futures market			1
the regulators dragged their feet			0
finally , after months and months of law - breaking delays , the commission in october adopted a rule			0
it was a weak version of a proposal that might have put meaningful limits on the number of futures and swaps contracts a single trader could hold			0
even the watered - down regulation adopted by the industry - friendly commission was challenged in court			0
the @entity185 and the @entity186 wanted free rein to continue unregulated gambling in the oil markets			0
so today , @entity50 once again is laughing all the way to the bank			0
once again , federal regulators should move aggressively to end excessive oil speculation			0
we must do everything we can to lower gas prices so that they reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand and bring needed relief to the @entity5 people			1
the time for real action is now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of sen. @entity206 .			2

@entity206 : speculators cash in by *jacking* up oil and gas prices ; market loosely regulated
speculators controlled 30 % of the oil futures market 10 years ago : up to 80 % today , he *writes*
@entity206 : as speculators gamble , @entity5 pay a *virtual* speculators ' tax on gas
we can lower gas prices so they reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand , he says
