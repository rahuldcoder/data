-- this week , @entity1 opened recreational marijuana stores for the first time			1
and these stores do n't just carry your father 's kind of weed			2
in addition to highly potent cigarettes -- which are much stronger than those some people might remember from @entity14 -- stores will also soon sell super-strength , pot - infused cookies , candies , sodas , vapor and wax concentrates			2
@entity20 will tell what the effects will be , but the state is not the first place to implement such a policy			0
@entity26 started to sell marijuana six months ago			1
when president @entity29 stopped by a @entity31 bar on tuesday night , it comes as no surprise that someone offered him weed			0
@entity26 's experience with pot legalization can hardly be called a success			1
in fact , it should be considered a warning for the residents of @entity1			1
special - interest " @entity42 " - like groups and businesses have ensured that marijuana is widely promoted , advertised and commercialized in @entity26			1
as a result , calls to poison centers have skyrocketed , incidents involving kids going to school with marijuana candy and vaporizers seem more common , and explosions involving butane hash oil extraction have risen			1
employers are reporting more workplace incidents involving marijuana use , and deaths have been attributed to ingesting marijuana cookies and food items			2
so much for the old notion that " pot does n't kill			0
" marijuana companies , like their predecessors in the tobacco industry , are determined to keep lining their pockets			1
indeed , legalization has come down to one thing : money			0
and it 's not money for the government -- @entity26 has only raised a third of the amount of tax revenue they have projected -- it 's money for this new industry and its shareholders			1
open @entity26 newspapers and magazines on any given day and you will find pages of marijuana advertisements , coupons and cartoons promoting greater and greater highs			1
the marijuana industry is making attractive a wide selection of marijuana - related products such as candies , sodas , ice cream and cartoon - themed paraphernalia and vaporizers , which are undoubtedly appealing to children and teens			0
as @entity103 , medical director of the @entity104 recently said , " we 're seeing hallucinations , they become sick to their stomachs , they throw up , they become dizzy and very anxious			0
" @entity103 reported that in 2013 , there were 126 calls concerning adverse reactions to marijuana			0
from january to april this year , the center receive 65 calls			0
and , since @entity26 expanded marijuana stores for medical users , peer - reviewed research has found a major upsurge in stoned driving - related deaths ( that is not surprising since marijuana intoxication doubles the risk of a car crash )			1
it is little wonder that every major public health association , including the @entity125 , the @entity126 and the @entity127 oppose the legalization of marijuana			2
the scientific verdict is that marijuana can be addictive and dangerous			0
despite denials by special interest groups and marijuana businesses , the drug 's addictiveness is not debatable : 1 in 6 kids who ever try marijuana will become addicted to the drug , according to the @entity140			1
many baby boomers have a hard time understanding this simply because today 's marijuana can be so much stronger than the marijuana of the past			2
in fact , more than 450,000 incidents of emergency room admissions related to marijuana occur every year , and heavy marijuana use in adolescence is connected to an 8 - point reduction of iq later in life , irrespective of alcohol use			0
as if our national mental illness crisis needed more fuel , marijuana users also have a six times higher risk of schizophrenia and are significantly more likely to development other psychotic illnesses			1
it is no wonder that health groups such as the @entity167 of @entity168 are increasingly concerned about marijuana use and legalization			2
that does not mean we need to arrest our way out of a marijuana problem			0
we should reform criminal justice practices and emphasize prevention , early intervention and treatment when necessary			0
but we do not need to legalize -- and thus commercialize and advertise -- marijuana to implement these reforms			0
the only people better off under legalization are the big companies that stand to profit from sales of marijuana			1
and we can be sure they will get even richer while public health and safety suffers			0
@entity189 legalizes medical marijuana ' i like weed , and i 'm a good person ' : pot smokers fight stereotypes			2

sales of recreational marijuana began in @entity1 this week
@entity199 : @entity26 's experience with pot legalization can hardly be called a success
he says marijuana companies will profit from sales while kids will be harmed
@entity199 : marijuana users have higher risks of schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses
