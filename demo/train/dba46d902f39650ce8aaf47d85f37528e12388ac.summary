@entity0 -- @entity2 was in her home west of @entity0 last week when she heard the shocking news : @entity5 -- her brother -- was the new pope			1
in the past , she had prayed that the cardinals would n't pick him			1
" during the previous conclave , i was praying for him not to be elected ... because i did n't want my brother to leave , " she told @entity1 en @entity7 on monday			1
" it 's a position that was a little selfish			2
" but this time around , @entity2 said she changed her tone			1
" i prayed that the @entity13 would intervene and not listen to me			2
and it did n't listen to me , " she said , laughing			2
" it did what it wanted			0
" last week , soon after the white smoke billowed out from the @entity19 chimney , she heard her brother 's voice crackling through the telephone line			1
" i almost died , " she said			0
" the telephone rang and my son answered			0
i heard him say , ' ooooh , @entity27			0
' i could n't believe it			2
" her brother , who chose the name @entity5 , told her not to worry and reassured her he was well -- something she 's also seen watching his face as the events of recent days unfolded on television			1
" i told him i wanted to hug him , " she said , " and he told me that we are already embracing from a distance , which is also something that i feel and that is real			0
" then , the pope told her to pass along his warm greetings to the rest of the family			2
" he said , ' i can not call everyone			0
we are a very big family , so please send them my love			0
because if i call everyone , it will empty the @entity51 coffers , ' " @entity2 said			1
standing outside her house in a middle - class area about 45 minutes from @entity53 's capital , she laughed monday as she described his comments			1
she said it was a sign that even now , thousands of miles away in @entity59 and in the highest office in the hierarchy of the @entity62 , her brother showed the same sense of humor he displayed since their childhood growing up in @entity53			1
" i think that 's why he became pope ... if he had to be firm in something , he was , " she said			1
" but he was always like that , with a sense of humor			0
" it 's clear , @entity2 said , that her brother -- the first pope from @entity75 -- will be a pope for the masses			1
" i feel like the church opened its doors , and said to the world , " here i am			1
i am not from one continent , but absolutely belong to everyone			0
' " she dismissed concerns raised by critics who accuse @entity5 of being complicit with @entity53 's brutal military dictatorship from the 1970s -- an accusation the @entity62 denies			1
" i am sure , and that is where my calmness is born , that my brother did n't participate in that , " she said			2
" i do n't like to get involved in destructive and scandalous matters			0
those rumors are destructive and my purpose is to construct , " she said			0
" so let them say what they want			0
" why @entity5 ? new pope explains his new name @entity1 en @entity102 's @entity101 reported from @entity0			2
