@entity0 -- food safety regulators do n't expect any more recalls after last week 's withdrawal of about 550 million eggs from the @entity7 market , but inspections are still going on following a salmonella outbreak traced to two @entity11 farms , federal officials said monday			1
@entity12 , the associate commissioner for food safety at the @entity14 , said it was " a little premature " to discuss the findings of those inspections			1
@entity14 commissioner @entity17 said on sunday night that farms involved in the recall fell short of safety standards			1
@entity12 would not release details of the inspections , which also involve a third operation that supplied the two egg producers , but the results could be released later this week , he said			2
about 1,300 cases of salmonella have been linked to eggs from @entity29 and @entity30 of @entity11 , forcing a recall of their products in at least 17 states , the @entity14 and the @entity35 reported			1
@entity36 has recalled 380 million eggs , while @entity30 recalled 170 million eggs			1
" we have a very complicated network of food distribution in this country , " @entity17 told @entity1 's " @entity43 " on monday			1
" you start with a couple of farms in @entity11 and you can get nationwide exposure			0
" speaking on a conference call with reporters monday afternoon , @entity48 said federal regulations that took effect in july could have prevented the recall			0
the new regulation went into effect july 9 , requiring egg producers with more than 3,000 hens to take measures designed to prevent the spread of salmonella			2
the current outbreak began in may , according to the @entity14			1
" we believe that had these rules been in place at an earlier time , it would have very likely enabled us to identify the problems on this farm before this kind of outbreak occurred , " @entity17 said			0
while @entity14 inspectors typically did n't inspect farms until after an outbreak of illness , @entity12 said under the new rule , " we will be beginning routine inspections of egg farms throughout the @entity7			1
" the @entity14 said some companies that bought and resold eggs from @entity29 or @entity81 could issue sub-recalls , meaning they would ask their customers to return the products			1
but that wo n't add to the more than half a billion eggs already recalled			2
the @entity88 family of @entity89 , @entity90 , was among those afflicted by the outbreak			2
that was kind of the first thing , " @entity88 told @entity1 affiliate @entity95 , " and then headaches and then throwing up and then it was body aches			2
i could n't even move			0
i mean it was like in your joints it hurt so bad			0
it was worse than any flu i 've ever had			0
" @entity107 , 10 , added , " we thought we had the flu , but then we saw the egg recall and we figured that 's what it was because my dad read off the symptoms from the computer and those were all the symptoms we had			2
" the @entity117 and their neighbors both told @entity95 they bought @entity30 eggs at @entity120			2
@entity30 , one of the largest @entity7 producers , said in a statement sunday it is devastated by the possible connection between its product and salmonella			0
the company said it would work with the @entity14 to review " every phase of our operation " and fix any problems			1
both @entity36 and @entity30 were supplied by another company , @entity131 , which provided feed and young birds			1
both @entity29 and @entity131 are owned by the @entity135 family , which has a string of agribusiness interests in the @entity139 and @entity140			2
those companies ' records have come under new scrutiny since the recalls were announced earlier this month			2
in june , company owner @entity135 admitted to 10 civil counts of animal cruelty in @entity147 after a nonprofit animal welfare group conducted an undercover video investigation and forwarded its findings to @entity147 animal welfare officials			0
dr. @entity152 , the @entity147 state veterinarian , said the allegations included keeping too many birds in cases , failing to treat injured chickens or promptly remove dead animals , and improper euthanization			0
@entity152 said @entity135 and his company agreed to a $ 25,000 fine and made a $ 100,000 payment to reimburse the state for future monitoring of the facility			0
in 1996 , the @entity164 accused @entity135 of maintaining " sweatshop conditions " for migrant workers at its @entity166 , @entity147 , chicken farm , where then - labor secretary @entity167 said workers risked salmonella by handling dead chickens and manure with their bare hands			0
the @entity175 fined the company $ 3.6 million			0
in january 2002 , the @entity177 hit another @entity135 company with allegations that its supervisors sexually assaulted and harassed female employees , some of whom were in the country illegally , and threatened to retaliate against them if they complained			0
the managers were fired for " unrelated reasons , " the @entity177 said , and @entity135 agreed to pay a settlement of more than $ 1.5 million			0
in 2000 , @entity11 's attorney general declared @entity135 a " habitual violator " of state environmental laws after a series of discharges of manure from his hog - farming operations			0
he paid a $ 150,000 penalty and had to build six concrete storage structures , and his company was barred from expanding those operations			0
in a statement issued monday morning , @entity36 said it was working with the @entity14 on the current recalls and defended its record			1
" @entity36 strives to operate our farms in the most responsible manner , and our management team has worked closely with @entity14 through their review of our farms			1
we have reviewed commissioner @entity48 's comments to the media , but because we have not received any written reports from @entity14 to date , it would be inappropriate to respond to her remarks			1
it is important to note that any concerns raised verbally during @entity14 's on - farm visit were immediately addressed or are in the process of being addressed , " the statement said			1
" when issues have been raised about our farms , our management team has addressed them swiftly and effectively , working with recognized outside experts to identify and implement corrective measures for our operations , " it said			1
" we are approaching our work with @entity14 in the same forthright manner			1
" while the recall involves hundreds of millions of eggs , they represent less than 1 percent of the 80 billion eggs produced in the @entity7 each year , said @entity230 , director of the food safety program at the @entity232 , a trade association entity			1
" this is one of the larger recalls that have happened , " @entity233 said			0
but she added , " this is an extremely rare occurrence			0
" @entity1 's @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 contributed to this report .			0

new : inspections continue , but no further recalls expected , @entity14 says
a @entity247 family says eggs caused diarrhea , headaches and vomiting
@entity36 says it 's working to implement corrective measures
" complicated " food distribution network can expose the entire nation , official says
