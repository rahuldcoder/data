-- every year the brains behind your favorite reality tv shows flock to @entity4 , @entity5 , to talk shop and honor the best in nonfiction tv			1
this year 's @entity9 : the @entity12 took place recently over two days ; reality tv darling @entity14 was awarded the @entity17 award , while producer @entity18 , producer of the @entity19 hit " @entity20 , " was inducted into the @entity21 and took home three trophies -- most original concept , best docu - reality programming and the 2012 @entity11			1
at the forum , @entity0 's @entity24 chatted up two of the most successful reality tv producers : @entity28 , owner of @entity28 , better known as the creator of the @entity32 super-hit " @entity33 , " and @entity34 , owner of @entity35 , also known as the entity behind the successful @entity37 show " @entity38			1
" the two talked about everything reality tv - related -- from the shows they wish they had produced to the ongoing struggle to find people for their shows to why they get annoyed at all the people who think creating a reality show is easy			1
they also touched on how long " @entity33 " might continue , and their thoughts on @entity0 's decision to partner with celebrity chef @entity50			1
@entity0 : recently i 've noticed that networks which had no reality tv shows are now getting into the reality game			1
what do you think about that ? @entity34 : i love it because that means there are more people for us to sell to			1
@entity0 : is it becoming more difficult to cast or find people in reality tv shows			1
some failed actors are using the route of reality tv to get their name out			1
@entity69 : that 's why you do n't cast in @entity72 i did " @entity73 " in @entity75 and @entity72 , and every " @entity77 " contestant in @entity72 was like , " here 's my head shots and um , when do i get my $ 100 and what are the chances of me , you know , when do film directors get to see this and do you guys get a lot of calls ? " i said never			2
... @entity28 : ( @entity89 ) @entity88 is not watching " @entity77			1
" i mean maybe but not to find talent			0
i mean he may be watching it			0
but certainly not to cast his next film			0
@entity0 : have you both gotten better at pitching reality shows to networks since you 've had a successful track record with some of your shows ? @entity69 : i think so			2
because i think you get better at anything you do over the course of time			0
i think i 'm better at knowing the steps that it 's gon na take to ( make a show with ) subsequent seasons and how you 'll have to have a show that will have room to grow			2
@entity28 : no one wants a " one and done			1
" not a producer and not a network , because in the end of season one , everyone spends so much time behind the scenes in our offices and at the network level trying to crack it			0
... but in the end , you put so much into it that if you can get to season two , then you are off to the races			0
you know what works and you know what did n't work and then you can move forward			2
@entity0 : people watch reality tv , and some people think that some of it is crap , and ( it ) has led many to believe that anybody can create a reality show			1
@entity69 : this p * sses me off more than anything because people think because they watch tv they can make tv , and that may sound kind of simplistic , but people may actually think that these shows are very simple			1
i watch " @entity33 , " and i know that for every minute of on - camera drama there is probably an hour or two or more of off - camera drama			1
my show people say all the time , " wow , it 's just such a simple show			0
" we work hard to make them look simple ! @entity28 : here is my least favorite ( expletive ) thing			1
... you are in the process of deciding if you want to work with someone , and you show up with your camera , and they say you should have been here yesterday it was so funny			2
ok , well i 'm here today , and if i 'm shooting a show ; i 'm not going to schedule good tv			2
you 're telling me you 're so great that you should have your own tv show , then go ( show me what you 've got ) ! @entity0 : @entity171 , can you ever envision the " @entity33 " ( still shooting even in a nursing home ) ? @entity28 : the thing about " @entity33 " is that there is a guido born every day			1
... so for me it 's an endless supply			0
@entity0 : which show do both of you wish you had created ? @entity69 : i like " 1000 ways to die " ! @entity28 : i 'm so crazy because i love , like " @entity182 , " but i ( expletive ) love " @entity184 " so much it hurts			2
i literally like , ( expletive ) love it			0
it 's just like crack			0
i literally ca n't get enough of that show			0
@entity69 : can i change mine ? it 's " @entity191			0
" i love that show ! @entity0 : as you both know , @entity0 recently hired @entity50			0
what do you guys think about that ? @entity28 : i think it 's a great fit			2
@entity69 : i think it 's a great fit , too			0
i think when you are a network doing something new , why not go after a big name ? i 'm sure the cross over between your viewers and his show is a high - income viewer			0
@entity28 : i think it 's going to be fine			2
and i actually would like to see the new twist on it			0
like i do watch " @entity215 " like crazy and i ( @entity210 ) it , and i 'm into it , but now i 'm excited to see what happens on another network .			0
