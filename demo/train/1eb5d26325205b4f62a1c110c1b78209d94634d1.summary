-- a report by the @entity3 inspector general released tuesday said that former drug lab technician @entity4 was the " sole bad actor " at a @entity9 drug lab once responsible for tests related to thousands of criminal cases , and that directors of the facility were " ill - suited " to oversee her and other lab technicians			1
the state of @entity3 says @entity4 doctored evidence to change test results at the @entity15			1
after @entity4 's co-workers told state police her work might be unreliable , the state attorney general 's office began investigating the case in july 2012			2
the tampering called into question at least 40,000 cases going back to 2003 and , in some cases , may have wrongfully convicted the innocent			0
she was found guilty of multiple charges related to the case , including obstruction of justice , mishandling of drug evidence and lying about holding a master 's degree in chemistry from the @entity35			1
she was sentenced in november of last year to three to five years in prison			2
" @entity4 was the sole bad actor at the @entity40 though many of the chemists worked alongside @entity4 for years , the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) found no evidence that any other chemist at the @entity40 committed any malfeasance with respect to testing evidence or knowingly aided @entity4 in committing her malfeasance , " the report said			1
but the report did n't stop short of blaming the unprecedented breach in confidence solely on @entity4			2
" the directors were ill - suited to oversee a forensic drug lab , provided almost no supervision , were habitually unresponsive to chemists ' complaints and suspicions , and severely downplayed @entity4 's major breach in chain - of - custody protocol upon discovering it , " according to the inspector general 's report			1
the inspector general 's @entity38 reviewed more than 200,000 documents -- including e-mails , lab results and lab records -- and interviewed more than 40 people who worked with the drug lab to check for deficiencies , the report said			1
an investigation by inspector general @entity73 and his office showed that former department of public health commissioner " @entity75 and his staff failed to respond appropriately to the report of @entity4 's breach of protocol " and " the investigation @entity83 conducted was far too narrow , " the report said			2
gov. @entity84 closed the lab , in @entity9 's @entity87 neighborhood , in august 2012			0
that year , @entity75 submitted his letter of resignation from the @entity90 to @entity84 amid the investigation , and the @entity91 now oversee all of the state 's drug cases			0
the inspector general 's @entity38 concluded that " all samples in which @entity4 was the primary chemist should be treated as suspect and be subject to careful review			0
" in addition to the drug samples @entity4 mishandled , an additional 2,000 drug samples not handled by @entity4 were found to potentially contain " exculpatory evidence " to defendants in criminal cases because the drug lab failed to disclose " additional , inconsistent testing results , " the report said			1
the inspector general 's @entity38 says it is retesting these samples and will give prosecutors and defendants accurate information about the tests when they 're completed			0
in november 2012 , @entity115 , who was convicted of a cocaine charge in 2009 , was released from prison after his defense team questioned the validity of @entity4 's testing results and her expert testimony			1
after his release , he was arrested on a gun possession charge			0
while on bail for that charge , he was arrested and charged with the murder of @entity128 , 45 , the @entity124 said			0
@entity115 is awaiting trial on the murder charge			0
the next hearing in this case is a motions hearing on march 11 , the @entity131 said .			0
