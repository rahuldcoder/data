-- the author of a now - retracted study linking autism to childhood vaccines expected a related medical test to rack up sales of up to $ 43 million a year , a @entity2 medical journal reported tuesday			1
the report in the medical journal @entity11 is the second in a series sharply critical of dr. @entity14 , who reported the link in 1998			1
it follows the journal 's declaration last week that the 1998 paper in which @entity14 first suggested a connection between autism and the measles , mumps and rubella , or @entity26 , vaccine was an " elaborate fraud			1
" the venture " was to be launched off the back of the vaccine scare , diagnosing a purported -- and still unsubstantiated -- ' new syndrome , ' " @entity11 reported tuesday			1
a prospectus for potential investors suggested that a test for the disorder @entity14 dubbed " autistic enterocolitis " could produce as much as 28 million pounds ( $ 43 million @entity37 ) in revenue , the journal reported , with " litigation driven testing " of patients in the @entity37 and @entity2 its initial market			1
among his partners in the enterprise was the father of one of the 12 children in the 1998 study that launched the controversy , the journal reported			0
in 2010 , after a lengthy investigation , @entity2 authorities stripped @entity14 of his medical license , and the @entity56 -- which published his original study -- retracted the paper			1
he has denied any wrongdoing , and a vocal contingent of advocates for children with autism continues to support him			1
@entity14 did not immediately respond to a request for comment from @entity0			2
but in an interview on an internet radio site tuesday , @entity14 again defended his research and called the @entity11 series " utter nonsense			1
" he said the patent he held was not for a test or an alternative to the @entity26 vaccine , as @entity11 reported , but an " over-the - counter nutritional supplement " that boosts the immune system			1
and he blasted allegations that he used the cases of the 12 children in his study to promote his business venture			0
" the children were not exploited , " he said			0
" they were seen because they were sick			0
we responded to a crisis			0
" he also repeated his attack on the author of the @entity11 report , freelance journalist @entity92 , whom he has accused of being paid by the pharmaceutical industry			1
in financial disclosure forms , @entity95 has stated that he has received no such payments			0
dr. @entity98 , a pediatric neurologist at @entity99 in @entity100 , said that if true , the latest @entity11 allegations would indicate a major ethical breach			2
" assuming the facts deer lays out are correct , it is disappointing that @entity14 in his book casts aspersions on others for all their purported conflicts of interests and failures of disclosure , yet does not examine the same issues in himself , " @entity98 said			2
" therefore , those who are trying to objectively evaluate the situation have up to this point not been given all the facts			0
" @entity11 reported the business venture failed to launch after @entity14 's superiors at @entity120 's medical school raised concerns in 1999 about a " serious conflict of interest " between his research and the company formed to launch his new product			1
" this concern arose originally because the company 's business plan appears to depend on premature , scientifically unjustified publication of results , which do not conform to the rigorous academic and scientific standards that are generally expected , " a letter stated			2
but the university offered him a year 's paid absence and help in replicating his original research with a larger group of 150 children in the name of " good scientific practice			0
" the follow - up study never occurred , and no other research has duplicated @entity14 's original findings , @entity11 reported			1
he left the university in 2001 , and @entity11 quotes his former boss as saying the school " paid him to go away			2
" the @entity11 pieces are a series of investigative reports , not a clinical study			2
the journal 's editor - in - chief , @entity154 , said last week that of the 12 children @entity14 examined in his 1998 @entity56 paper , five showed developmental problems before receiving the @entity26 vaccine and three never had autism			1
according to @entity11 , @entity14 received more than 435,000 pounds ( about $ 674,000 ) from lawyers trying to build a case against vaccine manufacturers -- a serious conflict of interest he failed to disclose			1
most of his co-authors abandoned the study in 2004 , when those payments were revealed			0
the now - discredited paper panicked many parents and led to a sharp drop in the number of children getting the vaccine that prevents measles , mumps and rubella			0
vaccination rates dropped sharply in @entity2 after its publication , falling as low as 80 % by 2004			0
measles cases have gone up sharply in the ensuing years			2
in the @entity37 , more cases of measles were reported in 2008 than in any other year since 1997 , according to the @entity184			0
more than 90 % of those infected had not been vaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown , the @entity184 reported			0
@entity0 's @entity187 contributed to this report .			0

dr. @entity14 expected his test to be used in ' litigation driven " cases , @entity11 says
tuesday 's report is the second in a @entity11 series sharply critical of the researcher
@entity14 has denied any wrongdoing and attacked the author of the series
