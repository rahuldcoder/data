-- @entity1 have done their bit , so now it 's up to great rivals @entity4 to play their role if this year 's @entity7 final is to become an extension of ' @entity9 '			1
leading 3 - 0 against @entity11 , @entity1 's other main rivals , @entity10 scored two early penalties to wrap up the most comfortable of 5 - 0 aggregate wins in the semifinal			1
the @entity16 forward , currently serving a three - match league ban after a red card for violent conduct , was struck by a cigarette lighter as he headed towards the tunnel at halftime but reappeared afterwards without showing any ill effects			0
the manner of victory is a modicum of revenge for @entity11 's 2 - 1 triumph against @entity1 in last year 's @entity7 final			1
@entity4 will meet @entity1 in april 's decider should coach @entity31 's side defend a 2 - 0 lead at @entity33 in wednesday 's second semi			1
needing an early goal to have any hope of overturning the odds , @entity11 made the worst possible start when @entity10 was tripped in the box after six minutes -- and the reigning @entity41 holder made no mistake from the resulting spot - kick			2
ten minutes later , the game at the @entity46 stadium was effectively over as @entity10 netted his second penalty after @entity48 was brought down			0
despite @entity11 's fine run of form this season , they lacked spark as @entity1 coasted into their third @entity7 final in the last four years			1
@entity55 also made it through to their domestic cup final but their 3 - 2 aggregate defeat of @entity59 , bidding to reach their first @entity61 final since 1922 , was far more dramatic			1
trailing 2 - 1 from the first leg , @entity55 found the first of the two goals they needed when @entity66 made the breakthrough after just 14 minutes			1
shortly after the hour , @entity69 's @entity68 scored the all - important goal in a game soured by the dismissal of two @entity59 players in stoppage time , with @entity76 @entity75 sent off from the bench			2
tensions frayed as @entity59 narrowly failed to score the goal that would have taken the game into extra-time			0
@entity55 will play the may final against either @entity83 or @entity84 , with the team from the capital leading 3 - 2 after the first leg on home soil			2
in @entity90 , the @entity89 took yet another twist as @entity92 dropped points for only the second time in nine matches			2
thanks to a goal from @entity96 , @entity98 's side were leading 1 - 0 at @entity99 until substitute @entity100 headed home in the 87th minute to salvage a 1 - 1 draw			1
the goal stopped the @entity104 from going four points clear at the top of the table , so offering the chance to either @entity109 ( who host @entity111 on wednesday ) or @entity112 ( who are also at home , against @entity114 ) to climb above them			0
" we were comfortable in the game , maybe too comfortable			0
we did n't kill the game when we had the chance , " @entity98 told reporters			0
" in this moment we have one more point than before			0
if @entity109 and @entity112 win ( on wednesday ) , they go above us but that is their job			0
every game is difficult and every team needs points			0
" @entity128 were among the night 's biggest winners after their 2 - 0 home victory over @entity131 enabled a side that has recently been fighting relegation to climb up to 10th after a third straight win			1
their rapid rise coincides with keeping four consecutive clean sheets in the top flight for the first time since 1985			0
@entity139 went a sixth game without defeat as they won 1 - 0 at @entity142 to go just two points behind @entity111 , while relegation strugglers @entity144 could only draw 0 - 0 at home to @entity147 .			2

@entity1 beat city rivals @entity11 5 - 0 on aggregate to reach @entity7 final
@entity4 can join them if they *protect* 2 - 0 lead at @entity33 on wednesday
@entity89 leaders @entity92 drop vital points at @entity99
@entity55 reach @entity61 final with nail - biting win over @entity59
