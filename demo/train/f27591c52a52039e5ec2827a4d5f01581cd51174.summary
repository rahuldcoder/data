@entity0 -- the sea of red that overtook @entity4 on tuesday night did n't just jeopardize sen. @entity6 's re-election bid — it exploded his entire worldview			1
thirteen years after he famously employed a " @entity17 strategy " in culturally conservative regions of @entity4 — courting @entity10 fans and commissioning a bluegrass theme song for his campaign on his way to the governor 's mansion in 2001 — @entity6 was clobbered in the commonwealth 's southern and southwest counties			1
the results were a shock to a senator who put in heavy time there			0
the margins made for a too - close - for - comfort @entity26 against @entity29 nominee @entity28 , who conceded the race on friday			0
even so , it was a reckoning that cut to the heart of @entity6 's public identity as a self - proclaimed " radical centrist " and ratified the urban - rural divide that characterizes the re-aligned politics of @entity4 -- and the @entity37			1
why , some flabbergasted @entity4 @entity38 are asking , did @entity6 spend so much time campaigning in rural @entity4 in the first place ? " he was running a campaign that was designed to win in the late 90 's , " said one @entity41 with @entity4 experience who did not want to talk on the record criticizing one of the state 's most prominent party leaders			1
coal country , and pretty much everything south and west of @entity52 , drifted firmly into @entity29 hands in 2010 , two years after president @entity54 took office			0
since then , @entity38 running statewide — sen. @entity56 in 2012 and gov. @entity57 in 2013 — paid only modest attention to rural @entity4 , focusing instead on turning out the @entity38 base in populous northern @entity4 and other strongly @entity61 jurisdictions around @entity52 and @entity62			1
but even in 2014 , @entity6 was still enamored with the mythology of his first statewide victory so many years ago			2
he spent considerable time visiting rural parts of the state , even teaming up with former @entity29 sen. @entity68 — no relation — for a last minute push before @entity26			2
" my path has been very different from @entity57 's or @entity56 's or others ' , " @entity6 told the @entity72 before the election			1
" to the annoyance of some of my so - called staff , i 'm going to @entity78 and @entity79 now because southwest @entity4 gave me a start , and i 'm not going to cede one part			2
" the comments look like a misstep in hindsight : in 2001 , @entity6 won @entity79 by 21 points			2
in his 2008 @entity87 race , he won it by 33			0
but on tuesday , he lost @entity89 by 23 points			0
the @entity72 reported that even his own advisers were urging @entity6 to layer more direct appeals to unmarried women and african - americans on top of his usual bipartisan rhetoric and conservative outreach			2
it might have made tuesday 's margin , around 17,000 votes for now , more comfortable			0
certainly the 2014 midterms were a bloodbath for @entity38 everywhere , and swing - y @entity4 was hardly immune			2
" in a wave , even @entity104 will have problems , and @entity6 is as close as you get to @entity104 in @entity4 politics , " said another @entity41 who has labored on several @entity4 statewide campaigns			1
" no one is immune to national waves , especially purple states like this			0
" looking at it another way , @entity6 was the only statewide @entity41 on a ballot in the @entity37 to win an election on tuesday			2
or as one strategist close to the @entity6 campaign put it : " who else but @entity6 could have survived a @entity29 tidal wave ? " " performing well in southwest @entity4 has been a mark of pride for @entity6 in the past , and a proven strategy for him in two elections , " said @entity121 , a @entity38 digital strategist who has worked for @entity56 and @entity57			1
" no one expected the @entity29 wave to be as large			0
if the media narrative had anticipated a closer race we would have seen even higher turnout in northern @entity4 and @entity132			0
" still , after the results starting coming in , @entity4 @entity38 who have worked on other statewide campaigns said they were mystified at @entity6 's approach			1
" this is a base turnout state now , " said one strategist who wondered why @entity6 was spending time on the trail with a white , 87 - year old @entity29 ex-senator instead of bringing in @entity61 - @entity61 surrogates for the final push			1
" why was he spending so much time in southwest @entity4 ? he should have been focusing on black parts of @entity52 , northern @entity4 , @entity62 , " the source said			1
@entity146 , one of three vote - rich northern @entity4 counties , is a happy hunting ground for statewide @entity38			0
in last year 's governor 's race -- another off - year election -- @entity57 made his campaign almost entirely about base turnout , focusing heavily on places like @entity146 in the @entity0 suburbs and the @entity61 - @entity61 vote in @entity52 and @entity62			1
to be safe , he brought in president @entity54 and former president @entity17 for closing campaign rallies			0
the result : @entity57 2013 outran @entity6 2014 in every big northern @entity4 county — @entity146 , @entity160 and prince @entity161 — as well as in @entity38 strongholds like @entity62 , @entity163 and @entity132			1
in @entity160 alone , @entity57 banked almost 70,000 votes with a 22 - point rout of his @entity29 opponent in the state 's biggest county			0
@entity6 won @entity160 , but by less — a 17 - point margin , or 54,000 votes			0
of the biggest @entity38 counties in the state , @entity6 only outperformed @entity57 in @entity173			1
last november was a better environment for @entity38 , and @entity57 was less well - known and viewed less favorably than @entity6			0
but @entity57 still only won the state by 2.5 points , validating his strategy of targeting the base with direct appeals to women and african - americans			0
@entity6 , it should be said , held onto a shred of dignity in rural @entity4 this year , outpacing @entity57 in the region but still losing badly everywhere except for @entity187 , home to @entity189 , and the city of @entity191			1
and yet , the few thousand votes he picked up here and there added little to his total margin			0
if he invested similar energy farther north , his vote lead would have been larger			0
but @entity6 allies insist that in a surprisingly too - close - for - comfort race , every little bit helped			1
and if there 's truth to the whispers of a rivalry between @entity6 and @entity57 — the @entity205 escaped this year 's midterms with a nice talking point			2
@entity57 , after all , won 1,069,789 total votes last year			0
@entity6 's total ? 1,071,049 and counting .			1

@entity6 's re-election in @entity4 was surprisingly close
he 's being criticized for not focusing on heavily @entity61 parts of the state
