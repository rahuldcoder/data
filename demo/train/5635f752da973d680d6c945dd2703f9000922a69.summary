@entity0 -- after a fourth consecutive night of violence that convulsed much of @entity0 and spread elsewhere in @entity3 , the scene before dawn wednesday was largely calm , a tentative calm enforced by thousands of police			1
hours before , police reported outbreaks of violence in @entity9 and @entity10 , about 100 miles north of @entity0 , and in the northwestern city of @entity12			1
there , a library and supermarket were ablaze , said @entity15 from the @entity16			2
in @entity18 , 80 people were arrested and 19 of them were charged , said @entity19 , a spokeswoman for the @entity20			1
in @entity23 , 30 arrests were made as hundreds of police sought to handle more than 1,000 reports of incidents -- most of them related to rowdy behavior by roaming bands of youths -- throughout the city and in @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , police said tuesday in a statement			1
eight people were arrested in connection with the firebombing of @entity41 police station , it added			1
@entity23 assistant chief constable @entity42 , who led the police operation , described the events in the town more than 100 miles north of @entity0 as " gratuitous , senseless and wholly unjustified acts of wanton criminality			1
" @entity48 , who cut short his vacation in @entity50 to hold an emergency meeting tuesday , recalled lawmakers from their summer break			1
he is to hold a meeting of his crisis - response committee at 9 a.m. ( 4 a.m. et ) wednesday			2
@entity56 is to meet thursday			0
@entity0 mayor @entity57 , who cut short his holiday in @entity59 , called the violence " utterly appalling			0
" the riots were sparked by the shooting death on thursday of 29 - year - old @entity63 , a black man			0
officers from @entity67 -- the @entity68 unit that deals with gun crime in @entity0 's black communities -- stopped the cab in the working - class , predominantly @entity74 district of @entity75 during an attempted arrest , the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) said			1
soon after , shots were fired and @entity78 , a father of four , was killed			0
shooting deaths are rare in @entity80			0
the @entity65 said tuesday an illegal firearm had been found at the scene , with a " bulleted cartridge " in the magazine , but there was " no evidence " it was fired during the incident			0
a bullet that lodged in a radio carried by an officer was police issue , the @entity65 said			1
" a post-mortem examination concluded that mr. @entity78 was killed by a single gunshot wound to the chest			0
he also received a second gunshot wound to his right bicep , " the @entity65 said , without saying who fired the bullets nor why police had stopped the cab			1
the man 's family and friends , who blamed police for the death , had gathered peacefully saturday outside the @entity75 police station to protest			1

violence continued in isolated pockets on sunday , spread monday to other parts of the nation and continued tuesday			1
@entity68 and @entity78 's family have appealed for calm			0
police said they were stretched thin as they tried to respond to emergency calls -- which were up nearly 400 % tuesday			1
@entity3 prime minister @entity48 's vow of action to quell rioting in @entity3 's cities was backed up by an increased police presence -- about 16,000 officers were set to be on @entity0 's streets tuesday night -- twice the number on monday night			1
" people should be in no doubt that we will do everything necessary to restore order to @entity3 's streets and make them safe for the law - abiding , " said @entity48 , who called the events " criminality , pure and simple			0
" the trouble -- described by police as " ' copycat criminal activity " -- takes place against a backdrop of austerity measures and budget cuts that have led to high rates of unemployment , particularly among the nation 's youth			1

with @entity68 detention cells full , authorities were taking those they arrested to facilities belonging to surrounding police forces			1

most of the charges relate to burglary , with other offenses ranging from assault on a police officer to possession of an offensive weapon and handling stolen goods			1
in all , 111 police officers and five police dogs have been reported injured , according to a police statement tuesday afternoon			1
" many officers are still undergoing hospital treatment , some requiring surgery , " it said			1

" apparently , some people are not depending on police for their security			2
@entity184 @entity3 reported that sales of aluminum baseball bats had skyrocketed since the violence broke out			0
in @entity189 , where monday 's disturbances first broke out , @entity188 , a mother of two , watched aghast from her home as hooligans , known as " yobs " in @entity3 , barricaded a normally quiet residential street with burning trash cans and clashed repeatedly with police for more than an hour			2
" it seemed like a war zone , " she said			0
" there were youths grabbing bricks from our front wall and hurling them at police			2
" a resident of @entity205 in southwest @entity0 , who did not wish to be identified for fear of reprisals , told @entity1 he had seen groups make repeated trips overnight to his street to fill their cars with looted goods , including televisions and clothes			0
the resident said this went on for several hours until police used armored vehicles to disperse them			2
" at first i was just , ' ok , it 's a bunch of kids letting off steam			0
' but once they started heavy , heavy looting , and it started getting out of hand , i started getting a bit concerned , " he said			0
" this is not something that 's typical of our neighborhood by any stretch of the imagination			0
" sociology professor @entity232 told @entity1 that a disproportionate number of young people appeared to be involved in the unrest and that the looters appeared to be motivated by greed			2
but people who have spoken to local ethnic minorities also talked of a sense that tension had been building over months , he said , with some upset by police " stop - and - search " tactics			2
a community cleanup effort began tuesday morning in @entity0 , with organizers using @entity248 to get volunteers together in their local areas , using the hashtag # riotcleanup			0
organizer @entity252 , who runs a network aiding small businesses on the south coast , said many thousands of people were supporting efforts to help shopkeepers			0
" i thought the quickest , best thing was just to help them get cleaned up this morning , get trading again , " he said			0
" it 's a city people love , and to see it destroyed in the way it has been is shocking stuff			0
" questions have been raised about what the disturbances may mean for security during next year 's @entity272 , which @entity0 is preparing to host			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity274 told @entity1 : " a lot of detailed work has taken place regarding security plans for the @entity272 , and we will continue to review them together with the @entity68 and the @entity281 over the coming year			0
" @entity75 has been the site of riots before			0
in 1985 , @entity284 , who was of @entity74 origin , was stopped by police near the @entity289 estate in @entity75 on suspicion of driving with a forged tax disc , a document all @entity3 vehicles must carry			2
a few hours later , officers raided the nearby home of his mother , who collapsed and died during the raid			2
