-- @entity1 will begin the construction of a new naval base this year in @entity6 's @entity5 separatist region of @entity7 , according to a @entity1 media report monday			1
@entity1 's @entity10 fleet is based in @entity11 under a lease agreement with @entity13 that expires in 2017			1
@entity1 's @entity15 news agency quoted an unnamed official at @entity1 naval headquarters as saying it wanted to station vessels at the @entity7 port of @entity20 on the @entity10 , reuters.com reported			1
" the fundamental decision on creating a @entity24 base in @entity20 has been taken , " the official told @entity15 , in quotes carried by reuters.com			2
" this year we will begin practical work , including dredging , along @entity7 's coast			0
" it will take more than a year to implement all works			0
" the official added that the deployment was to protect the breakaway region from @entity6 attacks			0
@entity6 launched a campaign against @entity36 , a @entity1 - backed separatist territory , on august 7 last year			0
the following day , @entity1 tanks , troops and armored vehicles poured into @entity36 and @entity7 , advancing into @entity6 cities outside the rebel regions			2
the two sides blamed each other for starting the conflict and have made accusations of ethnic cleansing			0
@entity47 has since recognized @entity7 and @entity36 as independent regions -- a move which angered many @entity51 governments who suspect @entity1 of acting to thwart @entity6 's ambitions of joining @entity54			1
this latest development comes despite comments made last year by @entity7 's leader that his territory would not be hosting @entity1 military bases			2
" there will be no new bases , " @entity60 told @entity1 's @entity62 news agency , adding that @entity1 's @entity24 will not be based in the republic either			1
" only units of @entity1 's ground forces that have always been based here will continue to be stationed in @entity7 , " he said			2
@entity1 's @entity24 is currently based in the port of @entity11 which belongs to @entity13 -- another former @entity71 state which , like @entity6 , aspires to @entity54 membership			1
the fleet is due to leave @entity13 for good in 2017 , in line with a 20 - year lease deal signed in 1997			0
however , @entity1 's diplomats and military have said they want the fleet to stay at its traditional home base after the expiry of the deadline , reuters.com reported .			0
