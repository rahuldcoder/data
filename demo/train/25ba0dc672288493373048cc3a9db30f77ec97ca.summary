@entity0 -- two weeks ago , the @entity2 passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill on a 68 - 32 vote , with 14 republicans joining the @entity7 majority to send the measure drafted by a bipartisan " @entity9 " to the @entity11 - controlled @entity10			1
president @entity12 pushed for the @entity10 to quickly take up the measure that would provide a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants living illegally in the country while bolstering security along the @entity20 border			1
the proposal also includes stronger worker eligibility verification standards and overall border entry - exit controls			0
however , @entity10 @entity5 made clear wednesday they opposed the comprehensive approach of the @entity2 and intended to consider the issue in a series of bills that will take months to reach final votes			1
in addition , the @entity10 @entity11 caucus was deeply divided on the question of eventual citizenship for undocumented immigrants , with some calling for a path to legal status while others opposed any kind of what they labeled amnesty for those who broke the law			1
while @entity10 leaders warned the party faced political harm if it failed to act on immigration legislation , a vital issue for @entity48 who comprise the nation 's largest minority demographic , the piecemeal approach and divisions over the legalization issue portend a messy and uncertain future for the issue			2
here are five reasons why : bipartisanship necessary in @entity2 , not the @entity10			1
a 60 - vote majority is needed to push major legislation through the 100 - member @entity2 , which means @entity59 and @entity5 usually have to work together to get anything substantive accomplished			1
the @entity10 , however , does not often require such a super-majority			2
as long as a simple majority sticks together , it can do virtually anything it pleases			0
mix that rule with increasing ideological orthodoxy and a decreasing willingness to compromise -- particularly within the conservative ranks of the majority @entity11 -- and you have a recipe for stalemate with the @entity7 - controlled @entity2			1
" passing any version of the @entity9 's bill would be worse public policy than passing nothing , " conservative pundits @entity72 and @entity73 argued tuesday in @entity74			0
" @entity79 can do the country a service by putting a stake through its heart			0
" in today 's hyper - partisan political climate , doing nothing is the easiest path for @entity79 to take and even a bragging point for tea party conservatives who came to @entity0 to shake up the status quo			0
while moderate @entity10 @entity11 leaders call for passing some kind of immigration legislation to avoid a potential political backlash , conservatives in the rank - and - file say such fears are unfounded as voters will reward @entity5 for opposing what they call a bad @entity2 bill			1
@entity5 do n't trust @entity12 on border security			2
@entity103 rep. @entity102 might have said it best			0
the two - term conservative @entity105 tweeted wednesday that " trusting @entity12 ( with ) border security is like trusting @entity107 ( with ) your daughter			0
virtually every congressional @entity105 says the @entity20 border needs to be properly enforced before @entity59 get their priority -- a path to citizenship for @entity115 's 11 million undocumented residents			2
sens. @entity116 , @entity117 , and @entity118 , @entity119 , added billions for @entity20 border security to the " @entity9 " bill			0
for a lot of @entity5 , though , the issue involves trust , not money			2
they remember the last major immigration reform effort , in 1986 under @entity11 president @entity128 , that also called for tightened immigration controls while giving three million undocumented immigrants legal status			1
they say the amnesty occurred but the tougher border controls did n't , leading to the much - worse situation today			0
now they do n't trust homeland security secretary @entity137 to secure the border			0
they also claim @entity12 's recent decision to delay implementation of part of health care reform showed the administration ca n't be counted on to fully enforce any law			0
by taking a piecemeal approach , @entity10 @entity5 hope to secure the tougher border security they seek before acting on a separate plan that could provide legal status for at least some undocumented immigrants			1
in short , pass a border security bill now , and then come back to the legalization issue once everyone agrees the border is sealed			0
@entity59 reject such an approach			0
the conundrum of citizenship / legalization while the @entity2 measure provides a multi-year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants , @entity10 @entity5 made clear wednesday they remained split about 50 - 50 on the matter			1
reasons for opposing any kind of legalization range from punishing lawbreakers to political protectionism , with conservatives fearing that most immigrants given what they call amnesty and the eventual right to vote will lean @entity7			0
however , the issue of legalizing immigrants is broad and complex , creating lots of uncertainty			0
for example , the @entity2 bill would automatically give immigrants living illegally in the @entity115 temporary legal status as " registered provisional immigrants			1
" only when certain border security steps had been taken could they apply for permanent residency , or green cards , as a step toward potential citizenship in process that would take more than a decade			0
many @entity5 made clear they do n't want any kind of legal status for undocumented immigrants until the borders are secure			1
even those open to legalization do n't want it to include a path to full citizenship			0
the labels and definitions of legal status will be a major sticking point in the continuing debate , but also could be a source of compromise			1
@entity10 majority leader @entity203 of @entity204 told wednesday 's @entity11 caucus meeting that children of undocumented immigrants brought illegally to @entity115 through no fault of their own should be provided a path to legal status , a position strongly favored by @entity59			1
the backing of @entity203 and other @entity79 for such a provision showed room for maneuvering exists			0
after meeting with @entity12 at the @entity10 on thursday , @entity11 sen. @entity216 of @entity217 called on @entity79 to negotiate an immigration bill			1
" we are ready to sit down with you and negotiate and bring this issue to a conclusion , " said @entity216 , part of the bipartisan @entity224			2
" sweeping reform is n't popular with @entity11 in either chamber			2
there may be more @entity2 @entity11 support for comprehensive immigration reform , but not that much			1
only 14 of 46 @entity11 senators backed the " @entity9 " bill heralded in its creation as a triumph of bipartisanship in a sharply divided @entity235			2
why should @entity10 @entity5 be more in favor ? remember that all politics is still local -- especially in the @entity10			1
many @entity10 @entity5 represent ruby red districts with few @entity48 , where any path to citizenship is unpopular and the big fear is a primary challenge from the right			1
which leads us to ... the @entity248 rule house speaker @entity249 has made clear that the @entity10 will only take up immigration reform that is backed by a majority of its @entity105 members			2
that is keeping with the maxim of former house speaker @entity248 that prevented votes on legislation that lacked strong support from the controlling party			0
@entity59 contend the @entity2 version would pass the @entity10 with a few dozen @entity5 joining them to overcome opposition by most of the @entity11 caucus			1
while it is unclear if that 's true , permitting it to happen would antagonize many of @entity249 's fellow @entity5			2
" if the speaker allows a vote on any immigration bill that results in passage despite a majority of the @entity105 conference voting against it , then it will be interesting to see if he can muster the votes to get re-elected after the next election , " @entity265 rep. @entity264 recently told @entity1 .			0

@entity10 @entity5 oppose the comprehensive bill passed by the @entity2
a *key* sticking point is the pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants
lack of trust is another *obstacle* , as @entity11 legislators remember the 1986 bill
@entity11 sen. @entity216 calls for the @entity10 to negotiate a compromise
