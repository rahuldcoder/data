-- it may not be the coughing , sneezing passenger next to you on your next flight who is spreading disease , it could be the airport you just took off from			0
researchers at the @entity11 's @entity10 department looked at the 40 largest @entity13 airports and figured out which ones would be the most likely to spread a disease in the event of an outbreak in the cities they serve			1
they factored in passengers ' travel patterns , the airports ' geographic locations , interactions between airports and even passenger waiting times for their study , published july 19 in the journal @entity30			1
one of the surprises in their findings was that an airport 's ranking on the researchers ' list was not necessarily tied to its size or busyness			2
while @entity40 in @entity41 and @entity42 were first and second on the list , respectively , @entity39 ranked third , even though it carries only 30 % as much traffic as @entity40			1
the researchers said that 's because of @entity39 's place in the air transportation network : in the @entity51 , with many connections to distant , large , and well - connected hubs			1
though @entity53 ranks first in the number of flights , it was eighth on the researchers ' list of potential disease spreaders			1
following @entity40 , @entity42 and @entity39 on the list are @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , and @entity64			1
@entity65 , @entity66 and @entity68 / @entity67 round out the top 10			0
public health crises of the past decade , like @entity71 in 2003 or the h1n1 flu pandemic in 2009 , have highlighted how easy it is for diseases to spread around the world , including through air travel			2
but existing models , the researchers said , look only at the final stages of an epidemic and the places that ultimately develop the highest infection rates			0
the researchers say the new model can help determine ways to contain an infection in a specific area , and can also help public health officials made decisions about treatment and vaccines in the early days of a contagion			0
" we are currently capable of modeling with some detail real disease outbreaks , but we are less effective when it comes to identifying new countermeasures to minimize the impact of an emerging disease , " said prof. @entity92 of the @entity93 , who studies complex networks and spreading patterns of epidemics			0
" the work done by the mit team paves the way to find new containment strategies " because it allows a better understanding of the patterns characterizing the initial stages of a disease outbreak , he said in a comment on the research			0
the @entity71 outbreak spread to 37 countries and caused about 1,000 deaths			2
the h1n1 " swine flu " pandemic killed about 300,000 people worldwide .			0

the list measures how likely airports are to spread diseases in an outbreak
researchers looked at the airports ' locations , connections and waiting times
@entity39 ranked third on the list , above busier airports like @entity53
