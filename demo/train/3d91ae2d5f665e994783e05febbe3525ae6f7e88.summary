-- the @entity3 exile group @entity2 has been removed from a @entity5 terror list , officials said friday			1
the group was put on the list of @entity8 , which includes more than 50 groups like @entity10 and @entity11 , in 1997 because of the killing of six @entity13 in @entity3 in the 1970s and an attempted attack against the @entity3 mission to the @entity16 in 1992			1
however , since 2004 the @entity13 has considered the group , which has lived for more than 25 years at a refugee camp in @entity20 , " noncombatants " and " protected persons " under the @entity22			1
@entity2 's move from @entity24 is nearing completion under the auspices of the @entity27			1
the members are relocating to a temporary site there before being resettled in third countries			0
secretary of state @entity31 was under a court order to decide by october 1 whether to remove the group from the terror list			1
" with today 's actions , the department does not overlook or forget the @entity2 's past acts of terrorism , including its involvement in the killing of @entity13 citizens in @entity3 in the 1970s and an attack on @entity13 soil in 1992 , " the @entity5 said in a statement			1
" the department also has serious concerns about the @entity2 as an organization , particularly with regard to allegations of abuse committed against its own members			0
" the secretary 's decision today took into account the @entity2 's public renunciation of violence , the absence of confirmed acts of terrorism by @entity2 for more than a decade , and their cooperation in the peaceful closure of @entity24 , their historic paramilitary base , " the statement said			1
@entity65 , head of @entity2 and president - elect of the @entity67 , praised the decision friday			2
" i understand that this decision was difficult and required political courage , " @entity65 said in a statement			0
" this has been the correct decision , albeit long overdue , in order to remove a major obstacle in the path of the @entity3 people 's efforts for democracy			1
for more than a decade , the mullahs made every effort to prevent removal of this designation			0
" they do not conceal their anger and disappointment and are trying hysterically to counter secretary @entity31 's decision with their lobby groups in the @entity13 , the @entity89 and @entity90			1
" the people of @entity13 and the @entity92 will realize that , contrary to the campaign of demonization and misinformation orchestrated by the religious fascism ruling @entity3 , our movement is far removed from all the allegations and accusations churned out by the current @entity3 regime , is merely striving for freedom and democracy in @entity3 , and is campaigning against fundamentalism and export of terrorism , " @entity65 said			2
being on the list carries a certain stigma and allows the @entity13 to legally go after financing and take other steps against individuals associated with these groups			2
officials acknowledge that the decision has been the subject of a contentious debate within the administration			0
@entity2 is considered by many in the administration to be a bizarre cult - like organization , prompting concerns about its behavior			2
officials say these concerns factored heavily in the debate			0
the group denies that it supports terrorism , and supporters rally daily in front of the @entity5 to demand removal from the terrorism list			0
many members of @entity133 have pressured @entity31 to do the same			0
moreover , @entity2 has paid well - known former @entity13 politicians and former administration heavyweights to speak out on its behalf , including former @entity138 gov. @entity137 , former @entity13 rep. @entity139 , former fbi director @entity140 and former national security adviser @entity141			1
the last major convoy of 680 members of @entity2 arrived this month at the temporary relocation site at a former @entity13 military base near @entity146 , the @entity16 mission for @entity20 said			1
the @entity5 said at the time that the arrival marked " a significant milestone in efforts to achieve a sustainable humanitarian solution to this issue			0
" @entity2 leaders have been reluctant to complete the move from @entity24 to @entity155 , formerly an @entity13 facility known as @entity155			2
they complained about conditions at the new camp , calling it more a prison than a home after the first convoy arrived in february			0
@entity24 was established in 1986 after former @entity20 leader @entity162 invited members of @entity2 to relocate to @entity20 in an effort to undermine the @entity3 government , which was then at war with @entity20			0
@entity3 also considers the group to be a terrorist organization .			0
