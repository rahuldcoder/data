@entity0 -- from one - time participant to present - day activist against the illegal sport of animal fighting , @entity2 came to @entity7 tuesday in support of legislation that would criminalize spectators and others who organize the fighting			1
while trying to keep young people from taking part , the legislation more broadly hopes to make it easier to prosecute people who finance and arrange the gambling , provide locations for fights to happen and otherwise have knowledge of the activity			2
@entity2 , now a star quarterback for the @entity24 , was released from prison in 2009 after serving 20 months of a sentence for a dogfighting conviction			1
his case involved bankrolling illicit animal fights in the state of @entity31			1
" i deeply regret my previous involvement in dogfighting , i 'm sorry for what i did to the animals , " @entity2 told a news conference			1
" during my time in prison , i told myself i wanted to be part of the solution , not the problem			0
" he was accompanied by the head of the @entity42 , @entity43 , who acknowledged it was initially difficult to consider accepting @entity2 's offer of help , until he realized @entity2 could carry some influence			1
" the biggest growth area for dogfighting was urban - based dogfighting , " @entity43 said			0
" @entity2 's own story starting as a young boy getting involved in dogfighting i thought was a very powerful testimonial			1
... " we both agreed that the best thing he could do was speak to these kids because of the platform that he has as an @entity62 star and to warn them away from this conduct , " @entity43 said			0
the @entity65 bill , introduced last week , would establish federal misdemeanor penalties against convicted spectators , and make it a felony for adults found responsible for spectators who are children			1
at the @entity7 news conference , organizers played some local television news coverage showing illicit cockfights , including the participants and the surrounding scene			1
@entity2 told reporters the video took him right to the problem			2
" to see the young kid walking with the cock , you know , was astonishing , " @entity2 said			2
" it was taking place in a similar setting of what i 've been around before			0
" this is what our kids are being taught , " he said , " and it 's inhumane and it 's pointless			0
" that child could be doing so much more with his life , instead of walking around with a cock in his hand , waiting to fight , even if he 's not involved , being there , his presence speaks volumes as to what goes on when people 's heads are turned			0
" the @entity103 ( @entity104 2492 ) was introduced by @entity105			2
@entity106 , @entity107 , and @entity108 , @entity109			0
