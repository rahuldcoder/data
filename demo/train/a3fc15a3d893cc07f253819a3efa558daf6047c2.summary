the search for missing @entity1 resumed friday in the southern @entity2 with long - range reconnaissance aircraft looking for possible debris from the jetliner in one of the most remote locations on @entity8			1
aircraft from @entity10 and the @entity11 have staggered departures to an area roughly 1,500 miles southwest of @entity14 , where two objects were captured on satellite and described as possible pieces of the plane , according to the @entity19			1
the first plane , an @entity10 air force @entity23 , arrived in the search area early afternoon local time , the authority said			1
given the distance from @entity10 to where the objects were spotted by a commercial satellite , the aircraft will only have between two and three hours to traverse the search area before having to start the return journey , the maritime authority said			1
calling it the best lead so far to the whereabouts of the airliner that vanished 14 days ago with 239 passengers and crew , @entity34 interim transportation secretary @entity33 told reporters the find " gives us hope			0
" " as long as there 's hope , we will continue , " he said			0
along with the aircraft , a motley collection of merchant ships are heading to the search area , where they will join a massive @entity53 cargo ship diverted to the area thursday at the request of @entity10			1
the sailors aboard the @entity53 ship worked throughout the night looking for the objects , said @entity59 , a spokesman for the @entity60			1
" all men are on deck to continue the search , " he told @entity61			2
" they are using lights and binoculars			0
" authorities were hoping for better results after poor weather hindered thursday 's search for the debris			1
even before suspending the search thursday night , authorities cautioned the objects could be something other than plane wreckage , such as shipping containers that had fallen off a passing vessel			1
@entity10 prime minister @entity79 announced the news to the world in a statement in parliament			1
officials then gave more details in a briefing closely watched by relatives of some of the missing			2
for the loved ones of the passengers and crew aboard the flight , the news of the possible find first announced by @entity10 was met with mixed reactions			1
" it strikes me as just one more lead that may or may not come true , " @entity97 , whose fiance , @entity11 @entity98 , was aboard the plane , told @entity61			2
" so it 's enough to make us all anxious again after a couple of days of quiet , but , you know , i 'm cautiously pessimistic that it 's not a piece of the plane			2
" new theories about disappearance the objects satellites captured images of the objects about 14 miles ( 23 kilometers ) from each other and about 1,500 miles ( 2,400 kilometers ) southwest of @entity10 's west coast			1
the area is a remote , rarely traveled expanse of ocean far from commercial shipping lanes			2
the commercial satellite images , taken sunday , show two indistinct objects of " reasonable size , " with the largest about 24 meters ( 79 feet ) across , said @entity123 , general manager of emergency response for the @entity10 maritime agency			1
they appear to be " awash with water and bobbing up and down , " @entity123 said at the news briefing thursday			0
the objects could be from the plane , but they could be also something else -- like a shipping container -- caught in swirling currents known for creating garbage patches in the open ocean , he said			1
" it is probably the best lead we have right now , " @entity123 said			0
" but we need to get there , find them , see them , assess them to know whether it 's really meaningful or not			0
" it took four days for the images to reach the authority " due to the volume of imagery being searched , and the detailed process of analysis that followed , " the agency said in a prepared statement			0
the size of the objects concerned @entity155 , one of the leaders of the search for @entity158 , which crashed in the @entity159 in 2009			2
" it 's a big piece of aircraft to have survived something like this , " he said , adding that if it is from the aircraft , it could be part of the tail			0
the tail height of a @entity168 , the model of the missing @entity34 plane , is 60 feet			0
@entity171 , a @entity61 aviation analyst and former inspector general for the @entity11 @entity173 , said she believes the @entity10 prime minister would not have announced the find if officials were n't fairly sure of what they had discovered			1
" there have been so many false leads and so many starts and changes and then backtracking in the investigation , " she said			0
" he would n't have come forward and said if they were n't fairly certain			0
" although the overall search area spans a huge expanse of 3 million square miles , @entity11 officials have been insistent in recent days that the aircraft is likely to be found somewhere in the southern @entity2			1
if this is debris , what happens next ? wide search continues until searchers make a confirmed find of debris from the aircraft , the search and rescue operation will continue throughout the search zone , @entity33 said			2
even as the focus shifted to the southern @entity2 , @entity33 said @entity34 was sending two aircraft to search @entity200 in central @entity201			0
that 's one of the locations along a northern corridor described as a possible location for the aircraft based on satellite pings sent by the plane after air traffic controllers lost contact with it in the early hours of march 8			2
@entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 were searching their territories , @entity33 said			0
@entity219 said thursday it is searching in the @entity220 and the @entity221 , sending four warships and three aircraft to scour the region			0
that area is far north of the region where @entity10 forces were leading the search for the photographed objects , but in an area previously identified as a possible crash site for the plane			1
meanwhile , 18 ships , 29 aircraft and six helicopters were taking part in the search in the southern corridor , where search efforts were intensifying in the area around the @entity10 satellite find			1
in addition to the @entity53 car carrier @entity245 , which arrived in the area thursday afternoon , a second merchant ship was expected to arrive friday night			1
the @entity10 naval vessel @entity247 is steaming to the site but remains " some days away , " @entity33 said			2
@entity216 plans to send its icebreaker and research vessel @entity252 , or @entity254 , which is currently anchored in @entity14 , @entity216 's state - run @entity250 news agency reported			0
the icebreaker will take four or five days to reach the search zone , according to the news agency			0
@entity34 's navy has six ships with three helicopters heading to the southern @entity2 to take part in the search , a @entity34 government official said			0
other angles although much attention was focused on the ocean search , investigators continue to follow other leads in the plane 's disappearance			2
among the many theories put forth since the plane 's disappearance is that one or both of the pilots were responsible in some way for the aircraft 's disappearance , especially in light of revelations that appear to show that a sharp , unplanned turn in the flight path had been programmed into the plane 's flight management system before one of the pilots gave a routine sign - off to @entity34 air traffic controllers			0
on thursday , a @entity11 official familiar with the investigation told @entity61 that an @entity291 team is confident that it will be able to retrieve at least some files deleted from the hard drive of a flight simulator owned by flight 370 capt. @entity295			0
investigators will also analyze websites that @entity295 and co-pilot @entity298 may have visited recently , the official said on the condition of anonymity			0
witnesses claim they saw plane live : latest updates on the missing @entity305 jetliner if this is the debris of @entity1 , what happens next ? anger as relatives confront officials difficulties may hamper flight 370 search searching for the plane truth -- amid speculation			1

first plane of the day arrives in the search area , @entity10 says
given the distance to the search area , the planes have only a few hours of search time
sailors aboard @entity53 cargo ship search through the night , spokesman says
officials caution the objects may not be plane debris , but shipping containers or something else
