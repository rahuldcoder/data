freelance journalist @entity0 was brutally killed yesterday after being held for 21 months by @entity2 militants in @entity3			1
despite the increasing dangers of working in the region , despite the many journalists who have been kidnapped or are still missing , and despite dreading this news , it has taken us all by surprise and we are deeply , deeply shocked			1
freelance journalists , photographers and video journalists have always played a vital role in newsgathering , and their contribution today is more important than ever			1
they make a crucial contribution to the free flow of information that is an essential part of a democratic society and fully deserve our support and protection			0
our trust works with freelancers on a daily basis -- helping them , helping their families , and sometimes working with them to help other freelancers			1
and @entity0 was one of these			2
we worked with him , helping him financially as he and his colleagues searched for missing colleagues in @entity3			0
@entity33 ' kidnap and death is yet another tragic reminder of the very real dangers facing journalists today			1
over the past two years , around 70 journalists have been killed covering the conflict in @entity3 , and a further 20 journalists currently remain missing , including freelancer @entity41			1
the committee to protect journalists say that the last two years have been the most dangerous for journalists on record , with 174 confirmed deaths since 2012			0
not only this , but threats , intimidation , assaults and kidnappings are becoming every day challenges for journalists working around the world			1
@entity56 columnist @entity55 writes : " @entity3 today is the scene of the single largest wave of kidnappings in modern journalism , more than in @entity61 during the 2000s or @entity62 during the 1980s			2
" these are terrible facts			0
so , what of the freelancers ? who negotiates for them ? who sends in security consultants to try and get them out ? who helps their families ? freelance journalists like @entity0 often work alone without the resources and support of large news organizations behind them -- they are always the most vulnerable to these dangers			1
the @entity79 has been supporting and assisting freelancers for almost two decades , and we 've never seen a demand for our assistance like this before			2
it 's not just freelancers travelling to conflict zones who are at risk			0
the majority of newsgatherers killed each year are journalists working in their own countries			1
freelance photographers , fixers and camera operators covering and reporting on conflicts that are affecting their own communities are often the most vulnerable			0
they 're unable to leave areas when it becomes too dangerous , or when their reporting is exposed , and are frequently threatened , attacked and accused of being traitors for working with international news organizations			1
beheading of @entity105 journalist @entity0 recalls past horrors so , how to protect freelancers ? how to help them work securely ? our organization gives financial and other practical support to freelancers in trouble			1
we offer online resources on safety & security for those reporting from dangerous environments , and run a training fund that provides bursaries for freelancers to enable them to undergo hostile environments training before travelling to a conflict zone			0
this training can teach freelancers how to assess risk and spot danger , handle a crisis , support others and give vital first aid			2
the right training can save lives			0
although our focus is specifically on freelancers , we are only one of the many organizations that exist to support journalists worldwide			1
@entity138 , @entity136 and @entity137 all have security guides that can help freelancers be more prepared in situations of crisis			0
@entity143 offers up - to - date information about the security situation on the ground for journalists , and @entity148 offers vital first - aid training			0
there 's no question that conflict journalism has always been a dangerous occupation -- and how very wrong that is ! so when we talk about protection , when we talk about security , we are talking about every sector of the news industry , whether news employers , staff or freelancers			2
in this brutal new world , everyone must be prepared to take responsibility -- for themselves and for others			0
@entity0 was a freelancer in the truest and most honorable sense -- a talented journalist and an exceptional human being			2
our thoughts are with his family at this tragic time , and with the families of all other journalists currently being held in @entity3 .			0

the @entity79 works with freelance journalists on a daily basis , including @entity0
@entity177 : @entity179 ' death is yet another tragic reminder of the dangers facing journalists today
freelancers often work alone without the support of large news organizations , she writes
