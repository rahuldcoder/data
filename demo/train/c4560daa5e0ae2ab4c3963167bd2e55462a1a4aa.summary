-- @entity1 was supposed to get to know @entity2 in the coming months , but not like this			1
not because of her tragic death in a plane crash at just 43 years old			0
the @entity9 - @entity8 singer , who died in @entity10 on sunday , had recently signed a deal with @entity12 to star in a sitcom about a single mom with quirky parenting skills who juggles family and business : a reflection of her real life			1
it would have been a chance for the country to get to know a remarkable superstar and woman who was talented , refreshingly down to earth and even inspiring			1
@entity26 had a big voice , a big personality and an undeniably big presence , whether she was onstage , belting out songs about heartache in traditional @entity9 dress or a sexy leather outfit , or off it , talking openly about her personal struggles and success			2
she was a luchadora , or fighter , who had overcome considerable personal strife , and she drew on her strength to climb to the top of a @entity43 music genre dominated by men			1
she started out in music as a young mother and eventually became a mogul who sold more than 15 million albums worldwide , including 1.2 million albums and nearly 350,000 digital tracks stateside ; sold out venues like the @entity52 in @entity53 and had a bilingual tv show , a radio program , several businesses , a foundation for battered women and millions of followers online			0
fans and our readers -- @entity63 first put her on the cover in may 2011 -- connected not just to her background as the daughter of immigrants who made something of herself , but her openness : she was neither perfect nor pretended to be so			2
she once brawled with a fan , but later made amends and invited the fan to an all - expenses paid trip			0
she had run - ins with the law and rocky relationships : she was married three times and was divorcing former @entity81 pitcher @entity80 at the time of her death			2
" i 'm not faking it in any way , " she told us last year about her life as reflected in her show , " @entity97 , " which aired on the @entity89 - aimed bilingual cable network mun2 , adding that she wanted fans to " see the human being behind the celebrity name , the lights and sold - out concerts			0
" instead , @entity89 journalists like me are left to introduce her to a larger audience by writing about her in the past tense			0
hearing the news of her death on sunday , i could n't help but think of another star , @entity103 singer @entity102 , who was poised to make an impact on @entity8 culture when she was killed 17 years ago			1
in both cases , we not only mourn the artist , but the moment , the lost opportunity to have one of us tell his or her own story beyond songs			1
but at least we 'll always have those			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity115			0
