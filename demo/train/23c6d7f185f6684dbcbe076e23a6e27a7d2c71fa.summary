-- mobile users who have gotten used to chatting with their friends via @entity5 will soon have to make sure they 've downloaded the social - media giant 's app designed specifically for that			1
@entity5 has begun notifying mobile users that they 'll no longer be able to text via its core app. instead , they 'll need to download messenger , the dedicated texting app @entity5 rolled out in 2011			1
the company started notifying some users last week			0
the update will roll out first to @entity20 and @entity21 users in a handful of @entity24 countries , according to a @entity5 spokeswoman			0
" messenger is a much faster and better experience and we 've found that people get replies 20 % faster on messenger than on @entity5 , " the spokeswoman said in an e-mail			0
" taking messages out of the @entity5 app also lets us focus on making @entity32 even better for everyone rather than working on two separate @entity5 messaging experiences			1
" in november , after @entity5 launched @entity38 , the company discontinued messaging in the core @entity5 app for people who already had @entity32			2
the good news for people still using just the @entity5 app is that they 'll be able to message friends in much the same way they do now			2
once both apps are installed , tapping the " message " icon on the @entity5 app will simply send the user to @entity32			1
they 'll be able to return via a " return to @entity5 " icon			0
@entity5 and mobile messaging have been linked in many folks ' minds since last month , when the company shelled out a staggering $ 19 billion for @entity58 , a texting app far more popular overseas than it is in the @entity60			1
despite speculation , @entity5 said at the time that it has no plans to merge @entity58 , which lets users send unlimited messages for no more than 99 cents a year , with messenger			2
both are part of a maturing set of apps that are marginalizing cellular plans that charge for texting			0
unlimited texting is already standard with many mobile plans in the @entity60 , but not so much in places like @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , where @entity58 is most popular .			0

messenger , @entity5 's texting app , will soon be required for sending messages
the company began notifying users last week
the message icon in the @entity5 app will take users to messenger
if you already have both , you wo *n't* see any change
