-- @entity2 chefs and fishing advocates claim , " come on in ; the water 's fine ! " but find themselves facing a public awash in apprehension over potentially oil - tainted seafood			1
when @entity11 , @entity10 , chef @entity9 recently urged people to choose @entity14 shrimp over imports during an interview about the state of seafood in the wake of the @entity21 spill , commenters responded negatively , writing , " what 's a little tar or mercury in your system anyways ? ! " and " i hope you enjoy the petrol in your fish			1
" another commented , " you eat the fish from down there , do n't complain to anyone when you get cancer in 10 - 15 years			1
i ca n't even believe a responsible human being would advocate for eating seafood slathered in oil first			1
" a tweet in their response to @entity0 's query about diners ' feelings on @entity11 seafood declared all post-spill offerings " a no - geaux			2
" similar sentiments abound online , despite authorities ' assurances as to the safety of seafood currently on the market			2
maps and apps track spill the supply of @entity2 food -- and the cost of it -- fluctuates on a daily basis , with the @entity59 map of safe and affected fishing waters constantly being redrawn			1
@entity61 reports that in light of the reduced amount of seafood on the market , " fish that normally sold for $ 2.50 a pound were going for $ 3.25			2
" on tuesday , @entity10 gov. @entity68 declared a commercial fisheries failure to trigger aid for commercial fishermen from the @entity72			1
in a letter to secretary of commerce @entity75 , the governor wrote , " the waters offshore @entity10 's coast supply nearly one - third of all commercial seafood harvested in the lower 48 states , with values in excess of $ 2.85 billion annually			1
as the largest provider of domestic seafood in the continental @entity14 , protection of @entity10 's fisheries , habitats and catch are critical to our nation 's economy and food supply			1
in addition to the potential biologic and ecologic impacts in these coastal communities , we must not overlook the crippling effect that this event will have on the commercial and sport fisheries in @entity10			1
the seafood industry is not only a large economic driver , but a defining element of the unique culture , and a crucial tourist draw to the state			2
" while the impact of the @entity2 oil spill on the future of shellfish harvesting is unknown , the @entity108 is closely monitoring conditions and sampling water at oyster beds and fishing docks to determine whether the haul is suitable for public consumption			1
it has the authority to order closures of areas that are deemed unsafe			0
the department 's daily assessments and harvesting closures are distributed to restaurants and seafood purveyors , and agency secretary @entity131 has released a statement declaring , " oysters exposed to the spill will not be permitted to be harvested , and thus are not available for consumer purchase			2
@entity133 stands by the quality of @entity10 seafood as a healthy and delicious choice for consumers			1
" on the other side of the @entity21 , groups like the @entity139 , which operates as a partnership between the @entity141 and the @entity142 and @entity143 , echo that sentiment			1
@entity154 , a seafood specialist with the @entity156 , writes in an @entity157 and @entity158 on the group 's website , " all seafood sold in @entity148 retail stores , supermarkets and restaurants will remain safe to consume prior to and during any potential exposure to contamination from the pending oil spill			1
" @entity161 of the @entity162 backed that claim in a statement , writing , " the @entity162 is closely monitoring the developing situation in the @entity2 region to help ensure that seafood potentially impacted by the oil spill is not making its way into commerce			2
fish and shellfish harvested from areas unaffected by the closures are considered safe to eat			1
there is no reason to believe that any contaminated product has made its way to the market			0
" for the proprietor of several @entity11 restaurants and author of the award - winning cookbook " my @entity11 , " @entity9 's livelihood hinges on their assessments being correct			0
he said , " we have the best and the brightest working for us on the state level , out there testing the waters every day to make sure they know exactly where this oil is and what effect it 's having			0
as the oil shifts and moves with currents and we get a list from @entity200 and @entity201 telling us what fisheries have opened or closed , and we buy accordingly			0
" he and some other well - known chefs are putting their time and money where diners ' mouths are			2
@entity9 and tv star and celebrity chef @entity209 will participate in a seafood cooking demo at the @entity211 on may 29 and then join @entity213 star @entity212 and @entity215 - winning chef @entity214 for a fundraising dinner at @entity9 's flagship restaurant august that evening			1
all the proceeds will go to aid the @entity219 and @entity220			0
the help is surely needed , as the situation in the @entity21 worsens and the financial future of multigenerational oyster and shrimp families hangs in the balance			1
" right now , it 's a really sad sight , " @entity9 said			0
" we had @entity229 of the @entity11 area started putting together food baskets and goods and a little bit of cash for the shrimping and oyster families of southeast @entity10 , because now they 've been out of work for a long time			1
many of our local fishermen , their only hope of getting work right now is helping out with oil mitigation			2
" @entity243 of the @entity244 echoes @entity9 's fears that a way of life hanging by a thread is even more deeply imperiled by the spread of misinformation			0
" the further you get away from the coast , the greater the perception that the fish is tainted			0
people will shy away from the line - caught grouper sandwich and opt for tilapia			0
" he continued , " that will absolutely ruin fishing for my generation as well as my daughter 's generation			0
i put my roots down here ; my daughter may not be able to dive again			0
i recommend anybody that comes down here to fish , to do it while they can			0
" even avid eaters without a stake in the business have stepped forward to offer their support			0
@entity0 contributor @entity277 took to @entity279 to declare , " the @entity280 will be held in june			0
@entity209 from the @entity213 will come down for the contest			0
" she told @entity0 , " it 's still the best seafood in the world			0
and i know @entity287 [ @entity286 , executive director of the @entity288 ] is working nonstop to ensure the best quality hits our marketplace			0

chefs and fishermen fear *customers* will *refuse* safe @entity21 seafood
*experts* sampling water at oyster beds , fishing docks to see if haul is ok to eat
