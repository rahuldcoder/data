@entity1 in northeastern @entity4 villages awoke tuesday to @entity6 militants at their doors , with the @entity9 extremists abducting scores from the @entity12 group and forcing hundreds more to run for their lives , an advocate said			1
the @entity6 fighters burst past a few men guarding the village of @entity17 at about 4 a.m. ( 9 p.m. et monday ) and abducted children , women and the elderly , said @entity21 , founder of the @entity22			1
talking to @entity2 from @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity21 said that between 70 and 100 people were kidnapped in that village and others in the same cluster near @entity29			2

" reliable sources " told the @entity32 - based monitoring organization that they 'd overheard @entity6 militants talking on wireless devices about having detained " 56 crusaders " in @entity17 alone			2
in the village of @entity37 , @entity6 executed two citizens for " dealing with the @entity39 , " the @entity30 reported			0
@entity4 @entity41 fighters -- who are part of the @entity43 , or @entity44 , and affiliated with @entity41 fighters out of @entity46 -- are among those battling the @entity9 extremist group			1
about 700 @entity1 families managed to escape the onslaught , with 600 taking up refuge in @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity4 , @entity21 said			1
the @entity1 lack food , water , blankets and other necessities after years of being in the middle of a civil war			1
" they are facing a possible massacre by the ( @entity4 ) regime and by @entity6 , " @entity21 said			0
" everyone is fighting everyone else			0
" @entity6 has attacked numerous minority groups during a bloody campaign to create a vast caliphate across @entity4 and @entity46 under its extreme version of @entity71 law			1
that includes @entity1 in @entity73 , a historic town of 50,000 people in northern @entity46 about 20 miles southeast of @entity75 that was overrun this summer			1
many @entity75 residents had fled to @entity73 after the @entity9 extremists took over that city , @entity46 's second - largest			1
at the time , @entity6 issued an ultimatum to @entity80 living there : convert to @entity82 , pay a fine or face " death by sword			0
" the latest reported abduction occurred about 160 miles ( 255 kilometers ) east of @entity73			0
@entity21 , from the @entity22 , said members of his group and other @entity4 christians have been " left all alone " by @entity4 's government and the world			0
@entity41 fighters may launch an operation to rescue those abducted , " but it very dangerous ( and ) everyone could get killed			2
" " this is like a miracle that they have survived this long , " he said of his fellow @entity1			1
" how can these people stay alive ? they are trying to defend their homes			0
" @entity6 is n't the only threat to @entity1 , given all the violence around them in the places they call home			1
nearly four years in , @entity4 's civil war is still raging -- with a @entity109 official in january reporting some 220,000 people killed and 7.6 million displaced			2
there are atrocities in that war that are n't being blamed on @entity6 , including a @entity115 report out tuesday blaming @entity4 's government for " hundreds of new discriminate attacks " in the past year , including the use of barrel bombs			2
@entity46 is n't exactly a picture of stability , either			1
the militant group is n't thought to have penetrated @entity123			2
that city has seen more than its fair share of attacks in recent months -- the latest being bombings , just a few minutes apart , that killed 21 women , children and men on tuesday , according to officials			1
still , it 's @entity6 that has gotten the most traction internationally for its success and tactics			0
the militant group has ruthlessly gone after groups that do n't give into its subscribe to @entity6 ' take on @entity82			0
some of those affected are @entity80 , but many others are @entity141 who do n't accept its radical ideology			0
by last year , @entity6 had taken over swaths of territory in @entity46 and @entity4 and later inspired terror attacks in @entity147 and the @entity149 capital of @entity150			2
but it 's received pushback recently , with a strong showing from @entity41 @entity154 fighters and the retooling of @entity46 's once maligned military			2
there also have been hundreds of @entity159 - led airstrikes in @entity46 and @entity4 targeting @entity6 , which the @entity159 government also refers to as @entity6			1
" this is a difficult mission and it will remain difficult for some time , " president @entity161 said this month			0
" ( but ) our coalition is on the offensive , @entity6 is on the defensive , and @entity6 is going to lose			0
" the threat is anything but over			0
in some places , the group is holding and even gaining ground			0
the biggest test , for all sides , will likely come over @entity75			0
up to 25,000 @entity46 troops could begin their push to retake that northern @entity46 city as soon as april , a @entity159 official has said			1
a @entity180 official said @entity181 is supplying the @entity46 with 10,000 @entity183 rifles , 10,000 @entity185 close combat optical scopes , some 23,000 ammunition magazines and " thousands " of additional helmets and @entity189 vests in preparation for the @entity75 assault			1
