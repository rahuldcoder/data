@entity0 , @entity1 -- deep and heavy beats vibrate large subwoofer speakers , hip hop artists grab the mic with one hand and gesture passionately with the other as thousands of fans rap along and dance in unison			1
you would be forgiven for thinking this was a typical urban concert in the @entity15 -- but it 's thousands of miles away in the tiny @entity19 nation of @entity1			1
i 've journeyed to this equatorial country for " @entity22 " to find out why the @entity1 are such faithful followers of the @entity15 hip hop scene and its culture , i also want to know what makes contemporary music here different from other @entity19 nations			1
my first stop is @entity31 , one of the most popular radio stations in the country			0
two outspoken women , @entity35 ( pronounced @entity36 ) @entity37 and @entity38 are local hip hop critics appearing as special guests on a daily program hosted by station manager @entity42			1
as they list popular rappers i realize @entity1 stage names mimic @entity15 stars ; @entity46 is an up and coming rapper channeling the street credibility of @entity48 - winning artist @entity49 ; @entity50 is a fierce female rapper comparable to @entity51 in the @entity15			1
meanwhile , muted music videos play on the walls showing off exotic cars and scantily clad women gyrating suggestively			0
turn up the volume and lyrics in @entity58 and @entity59 ( @entity1 's indigenous language ) prove this is a local interpretation or better yet , an @entity19 remix of @entity15 hip hop			1

he personifies a major difference between @entity15 and @entity1 music - no royalties ! this lack of additional income from selling music means most artists need a day job			1
so even though @entity70 has been performing since the 1990 's and is well known here , he still has to work weekdays in an office			2
we go there to meet him			0
@entity70 is an intimidating figure , six - feet tall or more with a large full frame but dressed casually			0
working at @entity1 's @entity85 he certainly stands out among men and women in suits			2
he 's helping the government in its effort to reach out to @entity1 youth and convince them that the future of the nation is directly tied to their actions			1
in fact , that inspirational message is the cornerstone of @entity70 's music			2
he tells me he 's simply emulating what @entity15 rappers do ; talk about humble beginnings , challenges , downfalls and motivate anyone in a similar situation to rise above it			2
for its part , the @entity1 government is becoming more sophisticated in how it uses music to communicate that message , partly because its president is n't shy when it comes to singing and rapping			2
back in 1977 current president @entity115 released a soulful and funky album titled " a brand new man ' " under the name " @entity119			0
" on the lp he sounds like @entity121 , which is understandable considering the @entity121 's former manager helped him record it			0

videos on @entity130 reveal a rapping @entity115 bouncing on stage with @entity1 's hip - hop community			1
during this campaign , @entity115 portrayed himself as " @entity134 , ' " the youthful candidate			0
it worked - he won			0
on the day of my hip hop tour of @entity1 , the government sponsored a free streetside concert with @entity46 , @entity50 and @entity70 warming up the stage for @entity65 - born @entity15 hip - hop star @entity142			1
this was n't just for young people , parents brought their toddlers , kids were arm - in - arm and absent was the macho bumping of shoulders and territorial stares common at other hip - hop events			0
i realise that for @entity1 , hip hop music is not only about hope but unity as well			1
a small nation of only 1.5 million people means relationships are incredibly important , community invaluable			0
artists have to work harder and be more creative since there is a smaller market in which to thrive			0
this is what makes urban @entity1 music unique , responsive and a genuine beat of @entity19 's true heart .			1

@entity2 's @entity170 takes a hip hop cultural tour in @entity1 .
he *visited* @entity174 to learn about the @entity19 remix of @entity15 hip hop .
@entity170 met @entity70 , a local hip hop star who uses music to reach *disaffected* youth .
for @entity1 , hip hop music is not only about hope but unity , finds @entity170 .
