-- @entity2 's wait for another @entity4 title must continue after the four - time grand slam champion suffered a shock defeat in the semifinals of the @entity8 on saturday			1
top seed @entity2 would have moved back to fourth in the world rankings by winning her 30th career crown this weekend , but was beaten 4 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 4 by fellow @entity13 @entity12			1
" i started the match really well , but as the match continued i was n't doing the things that really helped me in the first set , " said 2012 @entity15 champion @entity2 , who returned to the tour in january after missing the final third of last season with a shoulder injury			0
" i was n't being aggressive , i was n't in the court -- she was playing with a lot of confidence in the match and i gave her that opportunity to play her game			0
" since requiring shoulder surgery back in 2008 , @entity2 has struggled for consistency with her serve , and that was apparent in @entity34 when she lost in the last 16 to eventual runner - up @entity35 , and again in the @entity38 capital			1
the 26 - year - old , whose last tournament win came last april in @entity41 , ended the match with two double - faults			0
" they obviously came at the wrong time , " said @entity2 , who heads to her former home of @entity45 on sunday to start her role as a tv commentator at @entity13 's first @entity48			2
" when i was down in games in the first couple of sets i felt my serve really helped me , but in the third set i did n't keep that level up			0
i definitely need to improve that percentage going forward			0
" @entity12 , ranked 26th , will next take on either @entity56 at the indoor event as she seeks the sixth @entity4 title of her career -- but first in a @entity61 - level event			1
" i had to serve well -- i had no choice today , because @entity2 has one of the best returns on the tour , " she said			0
" we played a few years ago and she broke me a lot of times			0
" @entity56 , beaten by @entity2 in the 2012 final at @entity15 , battled to a 7 - 6 ( 7 - 3 ) 3 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) win over @entity71 in just over three hours after the @entity38 battled back from 5 - 3 down in the decider			1
meanwhile , a weakened @entity74 men 's team crashed out the @entity75 in the first round on saturday , losing 3 - 0 to a @entity78 side bolstered by the presence of 17 - time grand slam champion @entity80 and @entity82 winner @entity81			1
the @entity78 did n't need to field their star duo in the doubles , in which @entity85 and @entity86 beat @entity88 and @entity89 7 - 6 ( 7 - 3 ) 3 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 2 ) 6 - 2			2
the @entity74 , beaten by the @entity90 in december 's 2013 final , were missing rested world no. 2 @entity92 , the injured @entity94 and @entity95 -- who is serving a ban for missing a drug test last year			1
@entity99 also won 3 - 0 , eliminating a @entity101 team missing world no. 1 @entity102 , resting after suffering a back injury in his @entity34 final defeat against @entity81			1
@entity38 beat @entity106 by the same margin , while the @entity108 took a 2 - 1 lead against the @entity110 as @entity111 and @entity112 won their doubles rubber in four sets against @entity115 and @entity116			2
@entity117 went 2 - 1 up against @entity118 , while @entity119 reduced the deficit to the same score away to @entity122			0
in the other @entity125 first - round ties , @entity123 led the @entity126 2 - 0 after friday 's singles matches while @entity128 and @entity129 were 1 - 1 .			2

world no. 5 @entity2 loses to *compatriot* @entity12 in @entity38 event
@entity12 will play @entity56 or @entity71 in sunday 's final
in men 's @entity75 , 2013 runner - up @entity74 loses 3 - 0 to @entity78 in first round
@entity101 and @entity106 also exit by the same margin , losing to @entity99 and @entity38
