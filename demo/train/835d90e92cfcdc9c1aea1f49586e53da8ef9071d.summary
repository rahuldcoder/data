-- that " miracle " weight - loss product you 've seen on tv may not live up to the hype			0
the @entity6 has charged four companies with deceptive advertising related to their weight loss products			1
" @entity17 , " as the @entity6 calls it , is an effort by the federal agency to crack down on companies ' misleading claims about products that allegedly help consumers slim down			1
" resolutions to lose weight are easy to make but hard to keep , " @entity18 , director of the @entity6 's @entity19 , said in a statement			2
" and the chances of being successful just by sprinkling something on your food , rubbing cream on your thighs or using a supplement are slim to none			0
the science just is n't there			0
" only three weight - loss drugs are currently approved by the @entity34 for long - term use by certain adults : @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 ( sold over-the - counter as @entity41 )			0
the @entity6 has reached a settlement with @entity43 and a partial settlement with @entity45 , @entity46 , according to an @entity6 press release			1
the release also announced the charges filed against @entity50 and @entity51			1
users sprinkle @entity43 on their food to allegedly reduce hunger			2
it contains maltodextrin , tricalcium phosphate and silica , as well as natural and artificial flavors			0
@entity43 's advertising claimed the product is clinically proven to help people lose an average of 30 pounds in six months without dieting or exercise			2
" simply sprinkle sensa on , eat all the foods you love and watch the pounds come off , " one commercial promised			0
" it 's that easy			0
" a one - month supply of @entity43 is $ 59.00 ( plus shipping and handling )			2
profit from the sales of @entity43 in the @entity75 between 2008 and 2012 totaled nearly $ 364 million , according to court documents			2
the @entity6 complaint named @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity43 ceo @entity80 and @entity43 creator dr. @entity81			1
all were charged with making unsubstantiated claims			1
" @entity86 made a business decision to settle with the @entity6 so it could focus on the core of its business : its customers , " the company said in response on its website			1
" the settlement includes no admission of wrongful conduct by the company ... the company has agreed to make changes to its advertising claims but otherwise will continue business as usual			1
" the @entity6 shut down @entity45 leader @entity98 's weight - loss companies in december 2011 , claiming they were using fake news websites to promote acai berry and colon cleansing products			1
the @entity6 said consumers were being ripped off by paying up to $ 79.99 in shipping and handling charges for a " free trial			1
" in a statement , @entity106 said that it " regrets that it was forced by heavy - handed government tactics and financial circumstances , including an unwarranted freeze of the personal assets of @entity45 principal @entity98 and his wife ( who was n't even involved in the business and has been accused of no wrongdoing ) , to enter into this settlement			1
@entity106 never should have been named in this lawsuit and has been ruined by it			2
" @entity106 was an excellent company with first rank scientific advisors and an excellent , clinically tested weight loss product			1
it did not mislead consumers in its product claims or billing practices , and was itself a victim of deceptive and fraudulent conduct by its marketing partners			2
the settlement is a pragmatic compromise which admits no wrongdoing by @entity106 and mr. @entity98 and spares them expensive , protracted litigation			1
could they have had their day in court , they are confident they and their actions would have been wholly vindicated			0
" the company 's website , @entity141 , appeared to be down wednesday			0
@entity50 sells beauty products and fragrances that are " inspired by the @entity145 lifestyle , " according to the company 's website			1
@entity50 launched an advertising campaign in 2012 that claimed its @entity150 and @entity152 skin creams could help consumers slim down			0
commercials said @entity150 could " trim 1.3 inches in just 4 weeks " while @entity152 would " visibly refine and reshape the silhouette			0
" seven ounces of the products sold for $ 48 and $ 44 , respectively			0
" @entity50 takes enormous care in developing our entire line of products and we want our customers to make well - informed decisions , " the company said in a statement			1
" when the @entity6 raised concerns in april 2012 regarding the way research findings for @entity150 and @entity152 were communicated , we immediately took steps to review our advertising and marketing processes , and cooperated fully with the @entity6			0
as a result of the @entity6 inquiry , @entity50 has implemented a set of even more rigorous policies and procedures that will guide future clinical testing and ensure that our marketing and advertising comply with @entity6 regulations and guidelines			1
" @entity51 sells a liquid form of the hormone chorionic gonadotropin , which is produced by the human placenta and has long been said to promote weight loss			0
@entity185 products are sold online and in stores as pellets , sprays or oral drops , and are supposed to be taken with a very - low calorie diet of less than 800 calories per day			0
in november 2011 , @entity51 and six other companies received warning letters from the @entity6 and the @entity34			1
" these @entity51 products marketed over-the - counter are unproven to help with weight loss and are potentially dangerous even if taken as directed , " said @entity194 , acting director of the @entity195 in @entity34 's @entity196 , at the time			2
" a very low - calorie diet should only be used under proper medical supervision			0
" the company falsely claimed the drops were approved by the @entity34 and charged approximately $ 35 for a seven - day supply , according to the @entity6			2
it had sales totaling $ 3 million between 2009 and 2012			0
executives from @entity51 did not respond to @entity0 's requests for comment			0

@entity51 has submitted financial statements to the @entity6 saying it is unable to pay the $ 3.2 million judgment ; the fee has been suspended			1
the companies and defendants named in the legal charges are barred from making any other weight - loss claims about dietary supplements , food or drugs unless they have reliable scientific evidence , according to the @entity6			1
@entity75 spend billions of dollars every year on supplements			0
the industry reported an estimated $ 25 billion in sales in 2009			0
" market analysts suggest that the downturn in the economy has led to increased spending on these products , as consumers attempt to manage their own health care and avoid expensive doctor visits and prescription medications , " the @entity6 said on its website .			2
