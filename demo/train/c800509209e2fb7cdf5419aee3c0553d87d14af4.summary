@entity0 , @entity1 -- our politics have changed in @entity5 -- and , unfortunately , not for the better			2
with the @entity7 hearings of the 1980s and later the @entity9 affair of the 1990s , we were introduced to the " politics of personal destruction			2
" today , we 're living with the hangover and learning how destructive it can be when we take our politics personally			1
we 're a nation divided , where people can no longer agree to disagree without becoming downright nasty			1
@entity17 : how many debates needed ? just ask @entity19 , an @entity20 - @entity5 actress who was attacked on @entity21 for abandoning her support for @entity23 and daring to publicly endorse @entity24 for president			1
the actress , who starred in the movie " @entity30 " and the cable tv drama " @entity29 , " tweeted : " vote for @entity24			1
the only choice for your future			2
" the liberal @entity35 went crazy			2
one @entity21 user wrote about @entity37 , who is also half @entity38 , " you 're an unemployed black woman endorsing @entity24			1
you 're voting against yourself thrice			1
" another chimed in with : " i guess ' @entity30 ' star @entity19 endorsing @entity24 shows that she is indeed clueless			1
" but the really ugly barbs came from fellow african - americans who tweeted that @entity37 was a " jigaboo , " " traitor , " " house n --- --			2
" you get the picture			2
many went further , urging dash to do everyone a favor and " kill urself			2
" @entity19 defends @entity55 stance or ask @entity56 , a columnist for @entity57 who must have felt as if he was trapped in an episode of " @entity59 " after announcing that he had -- after the first presidential debate in @entity61 -- decided to support @entity24 for president			1
a self - described " lifelong @entity65 , " @entity56 wrote in a column after the first presidential debate that he could " no longer back a president who no longer acted like he wanted to be president , who offered a vision for the country as original as those college essays you can buy off the @entity71 , who in front of 70 million viewers acted like he had 90 minutes to kill before going out to dinner with @entity76 for their 20th anniversary			0
" @entity56 was castigated by his wife and friends and liberal readers , who through what the columnist described as " thousands of comments on the @entity57 website and @entity21 and @entity86 ; writers from national media outlets trying to pick the column apart because they were outraged that one they considered part of the tribe , a journalist and author , would actually turn away from the ingrained liberal leanings of the profession			1
" his takeaway : " liberals preach tolerance , but 90 % are every bit as nasty and vitriolic as the conservatives they rightfully condemn for being nasty and vitriolic			0
" and ask @entity103 , one of the country 's most prominent @entity104 , who last year went into the liberal doghouse when he criticized @entity23 for abandoning @entity104 and the working class			0
@entity103 called @entity23 a " black mascot of @entity110 oligarchs and a black puppet of corporate plutocrats			1
" he won the wrath of the rev. @entity114 , and fellow academic @entity115 responded by slamming @entity103 for making a " self - aggrandizing , victimology sermon			0
" photos : why your vote counts of course , conservatives also know full well how to level personal attacks			0
radio talk show host @entity123 stepped in it when he demeaned @entity127 law student @entity126 as a " slut " after she testified before @entity129 about the importance of requiring univeristy health insurance plans to cover birth control			1
radio talk show host @entity133 , who formerly hosted a daily talk show on the @entity136 , once said that president @entity23 was " a racist " who had " exposed himself over and over again as a guy who has a deep - seated hatred for white people or the white culture			0
" then there are all those tea party activists , some of which , in combating @entity146 , thought nothing of holding up racist signs depicting the president as an @entity20 witch doctor			0
at the end of the day , labels like " liberal " and " conservative " do n't mean much			0
human beings are all the same			0
some are raised to be tolerant of different points of view , others not so much			0
the more secure you are in what you believe , the less likely you are to attack someone for believing something else			1
opinion : i 'm @entity163 , and i 'm voting for @entity23 meanwhile , in this country , a lot of people seem to be on the attack			1
if you oppose the president , his supporters will call you a racist ; if you support him , his opponents will call you a socialist			1
you 're either accused of not loving your fellow man or not loving your country			1
it 's all part of where we 've arrived , and how we 've changed			0
we wear our ideologies on our sleeves			0
we keep our political views , and presidential choices , close to our hearts			0
and so when they 're challenged , we feel personally wounded			1
these days , if you challenge someone 's point of view or disagree with their choice in candidates , it 's as if you 're directly attacking them			1
it used to be that @entity104 could disagree over politics and still go out and have a drink			1
nowadays , if you disagree , one of you is n't just wrong			1
one of you is a bad person			2
and who wants to go drinking with a bad person ? now , almost everything about politics seems less cerebral and more emotional			2
the business is no longer about compromising with your opponent ; it 's about conquering him			0
we do n't just disagree ; we 're out to destroy			1
we do n't settle for half a loaf ; it 's all or nothing			0
the goal is n't to find solutions ; the objective is simply to win at all costs			0
@entity216 weighs in on war of words over @entity219 after tuesday 's presidential debate , @entity23 was criticized by some @entity221 for being too combative			0
but judging from the polls , @entity222 are delighted with @entity23 's aggressive stance , and they want more of the same in the final debate next week			0
as for what got us to this point , maybe the politicians are to blame for leading the way , with their negative ads and their tendency to treat every political campaign like a contact sport			0
or maybe it 's generational , a result of what happens when baby boomers -- who , since the @entity240 , have believed their values were superior to everyone else 's -- control the government			0
or maybe it comes from living in the internet age in which everyone has an opinion and feels entitled to express it freely and without apology			0
four years ago , with the election of @entity23 , it looked as if the @entity5 had taken a giant step forward			0
now , it looks as if we 're going backward			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity258 .			1

@entity258 : we 're a nation divided into two camps that call each other names
@entity258 : a black actress came out for @entity24 and got slammed and *reviled*
@entity123 calls activist a ' slut , ' he says , columnist blasted for changing parties
nobody can disagree without going on the attack , he writes , and leaders just as bad
