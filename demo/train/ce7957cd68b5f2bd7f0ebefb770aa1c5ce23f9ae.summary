@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity4 government is buying 10,000 taser stun guns for police officers across @entity0 and @entity8 , @entity4 's @entity3 said monday			1
@entity4 police officers use a taser gun to tackle a mock suspect in a training exercise			2
the move will expand the ranks of officers carrying the weapons from " select firearms squads " to " thousands of trained frontline officers , " according to the @entity3 , which is responsible for domestic policing			0
home secretary ( interior minister ) @entity20 said police " deserve our support , so i want to give the police the tools they tell me they need to confront dangerous people			0
that is why i am giving the police 10,000 tasers			0
" the guns fire barbed darts charged with enough electricity to stun a person , the @entity3 said			1
but @entity34 @entity4 described them as " potentially lethal electrical weapons " that deliver " 50,000 volts of electricity into a person 's body			1
the result is excruciatingly painful , causing a person to fall to the ground and , at times , lose control of their bodily functions			0
" the human rights group , however , expressed qualified support for the @entity4 government move , urging that the weapons be given only to officers specially trained to use them			1
" we do n't actually oppose the use of @entity29 as long as it 's by a limited number of highly trained specialist officers , responding to genuinely life - threatening or very dangerous situations , " said @entity50 , the organization 's arms program director			0
but , he added : " tasers are potentially lethal weapons which are already linked to numerous deaths in @entity62 and that 's why wide deployment without adequate training is a dangerous step too far for @entity4 policing			1
" " the home secretary should urgently review this decision and ensure that @entity29 only end up in the hands of a small number of fully trained officers capable of making the potentially fatal decision over whether to fire 50,000 volts into a person 's body			2
" @entity34 says more than 300 people have died after being shot with @entity29 since 2001			0
the decision to introduce tasers across @entity0 and @entity8 follows what the government called a successful pilot program with officers from 10 police forces , including @entity1 's @entity83 and forces responsible for @entity85 and @entity86			1
the test ran for 12 months from september 2007 with constables who had not previously carried firearms , a @entity3 spokesman said			0
before the pilot program , approximately 6,000 specially trained firearms officers across the country had access to @entity29 starting in 2004			2
most @entity4 police officers do not carry any kind of firearm , home secretary @entity20 emphasized in her statement , a fact she said she was proud of .			2
