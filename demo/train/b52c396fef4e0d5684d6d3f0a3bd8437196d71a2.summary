this is the second part of a two part series on the best used luxury cars			0
( @entity3 ) -- recently , @entity5 magazine issued its list of best and worst used cars , and divvied them up by price range			2
the @entity10 has several versions , but all have been annointed with the " supercar " appellation			0
using @entity5 's recommendations as a guideline , here is a list of some of the best used luxury cars currently on the market in the $ 30,000 + price range : 2007 @entity23 the newer mdx is classified as a crossover suv , but it 's a deluxe version			1
it was all - new in ' 07 , and was built on a proper platform -- as opposed to being adapated from the @entity29 passenger - car platform			0
it also came in three flavors : base , @entity33 and @entity34 , and all three were powered by a 3.7 - liter 300 - hp @entity35			0
the voice - activated navigation system is a nifty feature , as it comes with rearview camera and @entity40 satellite communications with real - time traffic data			0
@entity42 autos : used @entity23 2007 @entity44 328i sedan the 328i is another sleek , finely - tuned and beautifully - designed driving machine , offering sporty performance and @entity49 - style luxury			1
it is widely considered to be the definitive " sports sedan			0
" the ' 07 328i was propelled by a 3.0 - liter 230 - hp inline six - cylinder engine , which you can find mated to either a six - speed manual or six - speed automatic transmission			1
consumer reports also recommended the 3 - series coupe and convertible that joined @entity44 's model line - up in ' 07			1
@entity42 autos : used @entity44 2004 @entity61 the @entity61 is the top - of - the - line , high - performance - tuned version of the 3 - series coupe			1
performance power , therefore , is much higher than the other 3 - series editions			1
it came as a coupe or convertible , and churned out 333 horses			0
the @entity61 is often favorably compared to the @entity10 when it comes to quick acceleration , crisp braking and taking tough corners at brisk speeds without breaking a sweat			0
2007 @entity77 well , the marketplace surely is not lacking for luxury crossovers			2
here is yet another one that appeals to luxury buyers with its balance of suv - type spaciousness , pampering amenities , deft handling and burly engine muscle			1
for ' 07 , the @entity77 was a two - wheel - drive vehicle powered by a 280 - hp 3.5 - liter @entity35 and a five - speed automatic transmission			1
@entity42 autos : used @entity77 2006 & 2007 @entity93 @entity77 's m series is another winner , which seamlessly synergizes sleek styling , aggressive engine performance and a bevy of luxo - line amenities			1
it comes in both the @entity101 and @entity102			0
during the last used - model year , ' 07 , the primary distinction between the two was that the @entity93 was powered by a @entity35 that kicked out 275 horses , while the @entity105 muscled up to a 325 - hp @entity106			0
luxury features included standard leather seats with heating and ventilation , and optional 10 - way power adjustments for the driver 's seat			2
@entity114 just like in the $ 24,000 - to - $ 30,000 category , @entity5 recommended a slew of world - beating used @entity114 models in this segment : the ' 06 - ' 07 6 - cylinder @entity120 ; the ' 07 @entity122 ; ' 05 - ' 07 @entity123 ; ' 04 - ' 07 ls ; ' 03 - ' 06 @entity125 and ' 06 - ' 07 @entity126			1
@entity42 autos : used @entity114 @entity114 has placed no 1 in the @entity128 every year for the last 12 years - until ' 07 , when another carmaker , @entity130 , finally tied them for first			1
@entity10 ( various years ) @entity5 included the ' 98 911 in the $ 24,000 to $ 30,000 category			2
here , the model years get more recent as the price range climbs			0
the 911 went through some changes over this time period , of course , but all have been anointed with the " supercar " appellation			0
@entity42 autos : used @entity141 and by the latest recommended used - model year , the ' 07 , you could choose among various styles and engine sizes , including the @entity145 , with its 3.6 - l 325 - hp flat - six plant ; the @entity148 and @entity149 , with the 3.8 - @entity150 hp @entity35 ; the @entity151 , with twin - turbocharged 480 hp six - cylinder engine ; and the @entity155 track model , powered by a high - revving 415 - hp six - cylinder engine .			2
