-- you can draw your own conclusions about why @entity3 was fired , but as we look at the history of her tenure as executive editor of the @entity10 , the world 's most prestigious and influential newspaper , and learn details about how it came to an end , women everywhere are shaking their heads			1
any woman who has spent time in the work force is familiar with the challenges of being judged and treated fairly by her peers and bosses , of obtaining the recognition she deserves , and of being an effective advocate for one 's own career			1
women battle to break through the glass ceiling			1
after that , what comes is walking on broken glass			0
it 's popular now to talk about the need for women to lean in			1
but , that 's not even half the battle			2
turns out , as many women have discovered , that leaning in can actually get you sacked			2
just hours after @entity39 unceremoniously removed @entity3 's name from the masthead and @entity10 publisher @entity42 told employees she had been replaced , without offering much of an explanation , we learned that @entity3 , who had held the job for less than three years , had confronted her bosses about her compensation , telling them she had discovered her total compensation -- salary and benefits -- was substantially lower than that of her predecessor , former editor @entity52			1
the @entity10 quickly shot back , rejecting the pay disparity argument , saying @entity3 's total compensation was comparable to @entity52 's , and that her " pension benefit , like all @entity10 employees , is based on her years of service and compensation			1
the pension benefit was frozen in 2009			0
" @entity42 issued a statement later saying it was n't about money and it 's not true that @entity3 was paid less than her predecessor			1
he said that in her last year , her total compensation package was more than 10 % higher than @entity52 's in his last year as executive editor			1
now it 's become she said / he said			2
but compensation aside , in his announcement on wednesday , @entity42 did say his decision had to do with " an issue with management in the newsroom			0
" so it 's about management			2
that seems to match a remarkably similar chain of events in @entity77 , where @entity78 , the editor - in - chief of the prestigious newspaper , @entity79 , was forced out of her job after other journalists accused her of being too authoritarian , or " @entity82 - like			2
" what a curious coincidence			0
before @entity3 's departure , the personality - driven criticism had wafted out of the @entity10 newsroom , with accusations that reeked of sexism			1
a few months ago , an article discussed whether she is " bitchy , " and the word " pushy " keeps coming up			2
i have spent many years in the news business and i can think of countless successful high - level managers who were pushy , bossy , at times downright cruel with staff			2
those men were often viewed as strong , driven , effective , determined , good leaders			1
the @entity100 's legendary @entity99 was affectionately described as having a " pugnacious personality			2
" and @entity3 's predecessor , @entity52 , said his wife describes him as " socially autistic			1
" these traits would likely doom a woman 's career			2
in men , they are viewed as quirks , curiosities , even assets in the single - minded pursuit of journalistic success			2
men 's personalities are fodder for office gossip , but more generally viewed as a secondary matter , perhaps a topic for conversation at the bar after a long day			1
with women , it infuses their professional persona			2
people expect women to be nice , likeable or feminine			0
and it turns out being strong and demanding , and not always warm and friendly , can destroy your career , or at least make for a much less successful one			0
you can not win without losing			0
in order to do a good job , women may find they have to take actions that turn people against them			0
the problem with the stereotyping that demands women be liked and likeable is that it is much hazier , more difficult to counteract			0
it often lies hidden below the surface , alongside conscious efforts at equality			0
the @entity10 and @entity79 and other major organizations have made strides to promote women			1
@entity3 was the paper 's first female executive editor			1
her superior made a landmark decision in promoting her , just as they did with her replacement @entity152 , the @entity10 ' first @entity154 executive editor			1
but the tide of antagonism , the no - win rules that say you fail if you succeed can be found at all levels of the organization , including among rank - and - file staff			0
by objective standards , @entity3 did a fine job			1
the paper won eight @entity166 prizes during her brief tenure , with top - notch reporting and investigative journalism			1
signups for digital access among readers increased			0
the company stock doubled during her tenure , performing better than the rest of the stock market			0
doing a good job by objective measures , as we know , is not enough			0
that 's especially true for women , who as @entity182 pointed out in her book " @entity185 , " worry about being liked			1
if it is difficult for women to exercise leadership in order to advance the businesses they lead , that obstacle is a mere bump on the road when compared to the challenge of advocating on their own behalf			0
we do n't know to what extent @entity3 's complaint about her compensation was a factor in her firing			1
but we know just how risky and complicated it is for women to ask for better pay			1
women at every level are paid less than their male counterparts			0
top female executives make 18 % less than their male counterparts			0
the same is true for female journalists			0
trying to change that is excruciatingly difficult			0
as a recent @entity10 article puts it , asking for a promotion or raise can make women seem " overly demanding and unlikeable " and not " sufficiently feminine , unseemly , if on a subconscious level			1
" it 's all incredibly irritating and offensive			0
and it needs to change			0
the specific circumstance that brought @entity3 's sudden and shockingly undignified fall at the @entity10 or @entity78 's exit are almost secondary			1
the episodes have an ugly ring that is familiar to women			0
for all the progress we have seen , there is still a long , long way to go .			0

@entity3 , top editor at the @entity10 , was fired by the paper 's publisher
@entity231 : @entity3 's ouster raises questions about pay equity , gender issues
she says men get *praised* for being strong , but women are criticized for being pushy
@entity240 : *navigating* *corporate* *ladder* for women is paved with *uncertainty* and *biases*
