the chants of protest heard across @entity2 in recent weeks echoed wednesday in the small city where the civil rights movement reached a crescendo five decades ago			1
about 20 protesters walked up @entity8 's famed @entity7 and yelled : " hands up ! do n't shoot ! " and " i ca n't breathe , " in reference to the deaths of @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity16 in @entity17			1
but here in @entity8 , there was an added chant : " show the tape			1
" protesters want police chief @entity23 to make public a videotape of a police shooting that took place more than a year ago			1
@entity28 , 74 , was killed last december after he rushed an officer while wielding a hatchet , police said			1
so was the police officer			1
@entity23 said the tape clearly shows the killing was justified			1
a grand jury heard the case and decided not to issue an indictment , as was the case in @entity14 and @entity17			1
it was the @entity14 protests that inspired longtime activist @entity40 to lead the charge for the @entity28 family in @entity8 , though the circumstances are vastly different here			1
@entity8 , which is more than 80 % @entity45 , has a black mayor , a black police chief , a black district attorney and a majority black city council			1
but for @entity40 , the problem in @entity8 goes far beyond this one case			1
@entity8 once shocked the national consciousness when police beat and tear gassed 600 civil rights marchers as they crossed the @entity7 on their way to @entity56			1
the day became known as @entity57 and led the way to the @entity59			0
a movie depiction of the @entity8 story will release nationwide on january 9			1
@entity8 , said @entity40 , has come a long way since then , but black people are not yet free of injustices			1
" even to this day , we are suffering from the inferiority complex stemming from days of slavery , " she said			0
" it 's not just about color			0
it 's about a mindset			0
" @entity40 demanded @entity23 release the tape			0
" it 's a matter of transparency , " she said			0
@entity28 's brother , @entity77 , said his brother 's death was unnecessary			0
" show the tape to the whole town , " @entity28 said			0
but the police chief said he would not release the tape until the family has had a chance to view it			1
it wo n't be easy to watch and they deserve space to process what they 'll see on their own , he said			1
" i do n't care who 's jumping up and down , " @entity23 said			1
" i do what 's right and that 's what i 'm going to do			0
we want the family to see it first			0
" @entity23 said he has made arrangements for @entity28 's children , who live in the @entity102 area , to view the tape there			2
a copy is sitting in a @entity102 - area law enforcement agency , ready to be seen by @entity28 's son and daughter whenever they come in			0
and on friday morning , local relatives including @entity77 will gather to see it , too			0
the day before the protest , @entity77 pointed to the spot near a @entity114 restaurant where his brother fell to the ground			2
he said he had rushed to the scene about 15 minutes after his brother was shot to find an entire block cordoned off with tape			0
@entity28 said he saw his brother 's body lie on the ground for hours , uncovered			0
" everyone around here knew him , " @entity28 said			0
" he walked the streets for many years			0
" @entity28 once worked as a mechanic but " lost himself " after his wife left him decades ago and his house burned in a fire			2
even so , he earned the nickname ambulance , because he came to the aid of people , said his brother			0
@entity77 said @entity8 police knew his brother " acted crazy " but that he never harmed anyone			1
but to hear it from the chief , the officer who shot @entity28 had no choice			1
when officers responded to a call about a disturbance at @entity114 , @entity28 had ducked into a vacant building , @entity23 said			0
@entity28 then came out with a hatchet , " cussing like a dog			0
" @entity23 said officers told @entity28 they did n't want to hurt him and repeatedly asked him to drop the weapon			2
but then @entity28 turned on an officer , the hatchet raised , and that 's when the single shot was fired			2
truth is , @entity23 said , " the officer let him get too close			2
" added lt. @entity155 : " we could have had an officer 's funeral			2
" @entity155 has been with the department for nearly 28 years			0
he said he knew of only two police shooting fatalities in all that time			2
but @entity77 said his brother left the restaurant on his own accord and there was no reason for the police to give him chase			2
" why would you follow him ? " @entity28 asked			0
" that 's what gets me			0
" that @entity28 had problems was no secret , the chief said			2
but he ca n't help but wonder why @entity28 's family , in all the decades he was troubled , did n't get him the help he needed			2
why did n't they have him committed ? " they knew his propensity to act crazy			2
evidently he was deteriorating , and they saw it happening , " @entity23 said			0
the videotape of the shooting was taken by the officer 's lapel camera			2
@entity40 , the activist , said it was her husband , @entity188 sen. @entity187 , who was responsible for $ 30,000 in funding for the city of @entity8 to buy lapel cameras for the police force			1
" @entity14 , " she said , " is advocating for something we already have			1
but why ca n't we see the tape ? " the chief takes no issue with protests tied to the tensions roiling through the country			1
what happened to @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity16 in @entity17 and @entity203 in @entity204 bothers him , too			1
" we have things going on in policing that are n't right , " he said			0
if people want to scream outside his department , " i ca n't breathe , " he 's all for it			0
but what he ca n't get behind is how what happened in @entity8 is being lumped with these cases			1
" it 's wrong and disingenuous , " he said			0
" we 're no @entity14 , " and pretending @entity8 is , he said , " hurts the message			1

protest links @entity8 police killing of man a year ago to @entity14 , @entity17 cases
protesters want video of *incident* to be made public
officer , *victim* were black ; police chief says cases should n't be lumped together
