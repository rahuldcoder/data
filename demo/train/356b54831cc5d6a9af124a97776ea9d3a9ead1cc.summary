@entity0 , @entity1 -- this small @entity1 town is half a world away from the nuclear disaster unfolding in @entity6			1
nevertheless , the calamity is having a ripple effect			0
this week , the @entity9 held a scheduled two - day public hearing on a nuclear power plant near @entity0			1
there , @entity12 got a chance to voice their opposition on the proposed plant that would be built by electric power giant @entity17			2
those who support the plant repeatedly stated , " nuclear power is a safe energy source " at the two - day hearing			2
in addition , supporters argued that the $ 16 billion project would add over 750 permanent jobs and 2,500 temporary construction jobs			1
how close are you to a nuclear plant ? the money spent on the plant would be nearly five times more than @entity0 's yearly budget , said @entity34 , an administrative judge and lifetime resident of @entity36			1
" that 's a lot of money , " said @entity34 , 67			2
in addition to the jobs , he argues the project would help add to the town 's coffers through sales taxes and real estate taxes from new housing			1
that , he says , will help the small town of about 87,000 people continue to grow			1
and that 's exactly what rancher @entity51 is afraid of -- a larger @entity0 with a nuclear power plant			1
" i 've been opposed from the beginning and i 'm still opposed , " said @entity51 , 62			0
the proposed site for the reactor is located in a rural farming district approximately seven miles from @entity51 's ranch			0
@entity51 , a 6 - foot - 2 rancher with a thick @entity1 accent and an affable personality , said he loves his land and his way of life			0
his family has been a part of the @entity0 farming community since the late 1800s			2
" the road @entity69 is planning on using for heavy hauling , my grandfather built around 1920 , " the rancher said , while driving around his ranch with his son , @entity73			2
along the way , he proudly points the results of his family 's hard work			0
" our roots are in the ground			0
" his concerns over the dangers of a possible nuclear reactor so close to his ranch have increased since the nuclear disaster triggered by last week 's quake and tsunami in @entity6 , he said			2
@entity6 's nuclear crisis explained prior to choosing the location , @entity17 studied the possible impact of a nuclear power plant on @entity0 's community , water and ecology			1
@entity69 is the @entity96 ' largest nuclear power plant operator , running 17 plants in 10 states			1
see locations of @entity96 nuclear power facilities after studying the @entity0 site , the power company found the risks to be low			1
" nuclear power is a high risk , high stakes business , " said @entity105 with @entity12 at this week 's @entity9 public hearing			1
" everyone here should be sobered by the events in @entity6 and by the seriousness of matters at hand , " @entity105 added			0
" our thoughts and prayers go out to the people in @entity6			0
" the @entity9 must grant final approval before any new nuclear plants can be built and operated			0
no new nuclear plant has won final approval in the @entity96 since the @entity124 accident in 1979 , although site work is being done at a couple of locations around the country			1
at this week 's hearing , @entity69 representative @entity129 acknowledged the events in @entity6 , but he urged people not to overreact to what 's going on in light of the continuous news coverage of the unfolding crisis			2
@entity1 town ok with nuclear plant expansion he said he understands people 's concerns and why politicians have taken a closer look at the safety plans for nuclear plants in their states			1
" that 's a perfectly natural reaction			0
we expect to be held accountable , that 's part of our commitment to safety , " said @entity129			0
the situation in @entity6 does n't seem to have any effect on those who steadfastly support the proposed nuclear plant near @entity0 , @entity34 said			1
" i do n't expect people will change their minds , " he said			0
" i think people have had their minds made up			0
" he pointed to an unscientific online poll in the local newspaper , the @entity159 , which found that despite the @entity6 incident , 53 % of the 394 people polled said they favor the @entity0 plant compared to 23 % who oppose it			2
" there are plane crashes , people continue to fly			0
there are car accidents , people continue to drive , " @entity34 said			0
" there 's going to be nuclear power			2
" @entity0 's mayor @entity173 agreed			2
" my support has n't wavered at all , " he said			0
@entity0 county commissioner @entity175 said he and other city officials have " wined and dined " @entity69 in hopes of bringing billions of dollars to @entity0 's economy			1
@entity175 said if the deal falls through , the town 's economic future is at risk			1
those who oppose the plant said the site where @entity69 would build the plant lies on a " growth fault " which does n't trigger earthquakes but can cause the @entity189 to shift			1
@entity190 and his @entity192 group fears the ground beneath the proposed nuclear site could sink , causing the cooling water ponds , vital to a nuclear plant , to drain away			1
" it has active oil and gas extraction , " @entity105 said about the proposed site			0
" it can and will change over time			0
" @entity105 said @entity69 has not addressed the growth fault issue in its filings with the @entity9			1
but @entity203 , an attorney representing @entity69 pointed out that the growth faults are " are not tectonic in nature			1
" a study of the area shows one growth fault in the area moved only 8 inches over 40 years			1
" they pose no seismic threat , " said @entity203			2
" the only threat is a possibility of surface deformation if the growth faults were to move			1
" he did say all safety structures including vital safety cooling ponds would be located away from the growth faults			1
" we did find it and studied it , " said @entity203			0
" we planned the safety - related structures 500 feet away , which we felt was more than adequate			0
" @entity190 insists that even though growth faults are not seismic , they still pose " potential dangers to the safe operation of a nuclear facility			1
" " @entity12 believes that good engineering can address many potential safety issues , " he said			0
" however , you can not engineer around issues that are not recognized , studied and evaluated			0
" some residents , like @entity51 , who would live near the proposed site , feel that it 's a risk that is not worth taking			2
" ( what if ) all of a sudden that ( proposed ) plant has a problem and there 's an evacuation for a 10 - mile radius ? " the rancher wondered			2
" i 'm in the 10 - mile radius			0
what do i do ? try and pick up and try to run ? this is my life			0
" " why would you even want to risk this natural beauty ? " he asked , as he stood on the banks of the @entity246 next to his ranch at sunset .			0

@entity69 wants to build a $ 16 billion nuclear plant near @entity0
supporters say it will be a boon to the small town 's economy
the plant would lie on a " growth fault " that opponents say could be unsafe
@entity69 says growth faults are not seismic and do not pose a risk
