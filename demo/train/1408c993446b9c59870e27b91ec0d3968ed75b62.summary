-- the thought came to @entity2 during that most quintessential of @entity5 outings -- a baseball game			1
caught in a crush of people on his way into @entity13 's @entity12 , he could n't help but think about what had just happened in @entity15 -- sports fans crowded into a small space , a bomb tucked into a backpack , and then death			1
not that it stopped the @entity22 , @entity23 , man from enjoying his @entity13 vacation			2
" you just watch things more closely , " he said			2
@entity5 are doing a lot of that these days , especially after monday 's attack on the @entity29 , where three people died and more than 180 were wounded when a pair of bombs exploded near the finish line : â € ¢ a palpable sense of fear and confusion played out in the nation 's capital , at a @entity40 office in @entity41 and on television screens across the country as authorities scrambled to deal with a spate of suspicious package reports			1
the first floor of @entity49 's @entity48 was evacuated at one point			1
among the concerns were letters that initial tests suggested contained ricin , eerily echoing fears raised by letters containing anthrax mailed to lawmakers after the 9/11 attacks			2
@entity61 police chief @entity60 acknowledged " a bit of anxiety " in a letter to senators			1
" the bottom line of this multifaceted event was a positive one , " @entity60 wrote			2
" the packages were not dangerous ; they contained nothing hazardous ; and the person of interest was , while interesting , not particularly harmful although terribly disruptive			2
he was admonished but released			0
" @entity60 added , " this is the price of an open campus			0
the suspect in the ricin case , @entity77 , was arrested at his home in @entity79 , @entity80 , on wednesday			0
he has been charged with making threats against the president and sending threatening letters , the @entity81 said thursday			0
terrorists make us lose sight of the real dangers â € ¢ in @entity89 , an unattended rental truck set off momentary panic wednesday before police sounded the all - clear			1
the incident happened nearly 18 years ago to the day after @entity95 set off a devastating bomb outside a government building there , killing 168 people			0
â € ¢ and then there 's @entity100 , where nervous residents of that normally steely city made nearly four times as many suspicious package calls the day after the @entity15 bombings than they did in a typical day the year before , @entity100 police commissioner @entity105 said tuesday			1
vigilance is what authorities call it			0
" always looking for a way out " is what @entity110 of @entity111 , @entity112 , calls it			0
but it 's not just @entity15 that 's put her in that mindset			1
it 's the september 11 terror attacks			1
the bloodbath last year at an @entity123 , @entity124 , movie theater			0
the @entity125 , @entity126 , school shootings			0
" all of it , everything that 's happened , " she said			1
the reaction is understandable , said @entity132 , a professor at @entity133 in @entity134 , @entity135			1
the kind of mayhem unleashed monday in @entity15 reminds us , she says , of things about which we 'd rather not think			1
" that we 're all vulnerable , " she said			1
that vulnerability is something police recognize all too well			1
law enforcement stepped up security across the country in response to the @entity15 bombings			1
hundreds of @entity149 troops remained on duty in @entity15 on wednesday , backing up police			1
as did many other cities , perennial terror target @entity100 ramped up its security measures and will keep them in place , mayor @entity151 said monday , " until we learn more about what actually happened in @entity15			1
" in @entity159 , authorities vowed to take another look at precautions for the big marathon scheduled there this weekend			0
but security experts will tell you it 's just not possible to prevent every bomb , every gunshot , every tragedy -- especially not when it comes to large outdoor events , such as road races			1
the impact of heightened security on travelers " it 's extremely challenging because it 's not a secure environment , " said police @entity176			1
@entity181 of @entity182 , @entity183 , where an annual charity run in honor of slain @entity187 ranger @entity186 is scheduled for saturday			0
" we ca n't put fences around it ; we ca n't put an officer every 2 feet , " he said			2
" so we rely on every set of eyes out there			0
" so , as it often does in a free society , it comes down to us , to that word , to vigilance			0
you have to , " said @entity199 , a law enforcement analyst for @entity200 and @entity201 and a former detective in the intelligence division for the @entity204			0
but security experts worry that down the road , many @entity5 may weary of maintaining such a high level of cautiousness			1
" we as a country tend to lull ourselves into a false sense of security over the passage of time , " said @entity210 , vice president of the security firm @entity211 and a former @entity213 senior swat supervisor			0
the interest in the @entity15 terrorism case " will last for a few days and perhaps a week , and then it will become a distant memory for most people , " he said			0
it happened after the september 11 attacks			0
a month after them , nearly six in 10 @entity5 were worried that they or someone they loved would become a victim of a terrorist attack , according to a @entity229 at the time			1
by 2011 , the number had fallen to a little over one in three -- nearly what it was at its lowest point before the 2001 attacks			0
" it 's the old story about crying wolf and eventually people turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to it			2
they get weary of hearing it , " @entity210 said			0
" it 's very difficult to remain at that heightened state of awareness			2
you ca n't do it all the time			2
" in @entity250 , @entity135 , runners will head out this weekend for a half - marathon			0
sure , race director @entity252 told @entity0 affiliate @entity253 , they 'll think about security just that much more			0
@entity15 will be on their minds			0
but they wo n't be deterred , she told the station			1
" we want to send a message , " she said			0
" we ca n't all go home and stay in our houses			2
" @entity0 's @entity264 contributed to this report .			2

new : police chief acknowledges " a bit of anxiety " on @entity61
@entity5 are looking over their *shoulders* after recent @entity5 violence
but the violence wo n't stop many from going out and living
events such as monday 's bombings remind us that " we 're all vulnerable , " professor says
