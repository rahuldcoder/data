@entity0 -- president @entity2 made his final pitch for his prized piece of legislation -- health care reform -- on @entity7 on saturday , and @entity9 leaders decided to abandon a plan to avoid a direct vote on the @entity13 bill			1
president @entity2 told @entity14 on the eve of sunday 's historic @entity17 vote : " let 's get this done			1
" " if you agree that the system is not working for ordinary families , if you 've heard the same stories that i 've heard everywhere , all across the country , then help us fix the system , " @entity2 said			2
" do n't do it for me			0
do n't do it for @entity29 or @entity30 , " he said			0
" do it for all those people out there who are struggling			0
" @entity2 's speech came just hours after @entity9 leaders decided to abandon the controversial legislative mechanism know as " deem and pass " to avoid a direct vote on the health care legislation			1
they will now hold an up - or - down vote on the $ 875 billion reform plan that the @entity13 has already passed			1
multiple @entity9 sources told @entity1 that @entity9 leaders decided to drop the proposed tactic , which had come under fierce criticism			1
the sources said the @entity17 will have three votes sunday -- a vote on the terms of debate , a vote on compromise changes to the @entity13 bill , and then finally , a vote on the @entity13 bill itself			1
" we have been debating health care for decades , " @entity2 said			1
" it has now been debated for a year			0
it is in your hands			0
it is time to pass health care for @entity60 and i am confident that you are going to do it tomorrow			1
" if the @entity13 bill passes the @entity17 , @entity2 will sign it into law			1
if the package of changes is passed , it will be taken up by the @entity13			2
freshmen @entity17 @entity67 railed saturday against the bill			0
" the health care decision should be made between a patient , their family and their physician , " said rep. @entity70 of @entity71			1
" not the insurance company , not the federal government			0
and this is a great intrusion by the federal government in that decision - making process			0
" @entity9 leaders are trying to round up the 216 necessary votes to pass the bill			1
according to @entity1 's latest count , 33 @entity14 plan to vote against the legislation			1
thirty - eight @entity9 " no " votes are needed to kill the bill			1
multiple @entity9 leadership sources told @entity1 that @entity14 have more than 200 " yes " votes , though it was not clear friday night how close @entity14 were to securing the votes they need			1
@entity93 : share your thoughts on the health care bill one undecided congressman said friday that he refused to answer a phone call from the @entity17 until he finalized his voting decision			1
on saturday , @entity101 rep. @entity100 released a statement saying he has " decided to stand in support of this plan for health care reform			1
" administration officials claim that the reform plan has been picking up momentum in recent days			2
they told @entity1 they had a " really good day " thursday , when the nonpartisan @entity109 estimated that the compromise plan would cost $ 940 billion over 10 years while reducing the deficit by $ 138 billion -- $ 20 billion more than the bill passed by the @entity13			1
the budget office numbers reassured some fiscally conservative democrats , according to congressional leaders			0
" not only does it reduce the deficit , we pay for it responsibly in ways that the other side of the aisle -- that talks about fiscal responsibility but does n't seem to be able to walk the walk -- ca n't claim when it comes to their prescription drug bill , " @entity2 said saturday in a jab at @entity67			2
@entity17 minority leader @entity129 countered the president : " @entity9 leaders are telling their members after this passes , it 's going to become much more popular			1
well , they 're dead wrong			0
" " this is not the way to go , and the @entity60 people know it			0
" @entity93 : health care protests at the @entity7 if enacted , the measure would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of @entity143 and @entity144 over four decades ago			1
it would extend insurance coverage to an additional 32 million @entity60 , according to a preliminary analysis from the budget office			0
@entity67 contend the plan amounts to a government takeover of the private insurance system that will do little to slow spiraling medical costs			0
@entity2 addressed those concerns saturday , insisting there is no government takeover			2
" we are making sure that the system of private insurance works for ordinary families , " he said , calling the legislation a " patient 's bill of rights on steroids " and " the toughest insurance reform in history			2
" @entity67 argue it would lead to higher premiums and taxes for middle - class families while resulting in deep @entity143 cuts			0
among other things , the plan would expand @entity143 prescription drug coverage , increase federal subsidies to help people buy insurance and ban denials of coverage for pre-existing conditions			0
it seeks to bridge the gap between previous @entity17 and @entity13 bills partly by watering down and delaying the implementation of a tax on high - end insurance plans			2
@entity67 are fuming over the @entity14 ' decision to use a legislative maneuver called reconciliation , that will allow the compromise measures -- if passed by the @entity17 -- to clear the @entity13 with a simple majority of 51 votes			1
@entity14 lost their filibuster - proof 60 - seat supermajority in january with the election of @entity67 sen. @entity195 of @entity196			2
@entity67 contend that reconciliation , which is limited to provisions pertaining to the budget , was never meant to facilitate passage of a sweeping reform measure such as the health care bill			1
@entity14 point out that reconciliation was used to pass several major bills in recent years , including @entity206 's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts			2
@entity17 @entity14 have expressed concern that the compromise measures will not be approved by the more conservative @entity13			1
@entity29 said friday , however , that " when our members go to vote , they will have all the assurances they need " that the @entity13 will approve the compromise plan			2
meanwhile saturday , a @entity215 protest against the bill was held in @entity0			0
" we want this bill stopped , " organizer @entity217 said			0
" this is not what the @entity60 people want , and our congressmen and our congresswomen need to listen to the @entity60 people because they really mean it this time			0
" @entity9 lawmakers say they 've faced slurs a group of @entity67 congressmen , including @entity230			2
@entity231 of @entity232 and @entity233 of @entity234 , emerged saturday night to address the protesters who chanted " kill the bill ! " throughout the speeches			0
" our fight is not over , " @entity231 told the crowd over a bullhorn			0
" you represent what is good and right about @entity60			0
we will fight this bill until we completely defeat the government takeover of your personal liberty			0
