-- " @entity1 " closed out @entity3 's involvement in the series on monday night , installing @entity5 in her place , in a " new " series , " @entity8			1
" while i have no inside information about how @entity5 was originally cast in " the closer , " i 'm led to think , based on the premiere episode that aired after the " closer " finale , that she was never intended to be the new star of the show			2
because the new show is , i believe , an inevitable disappointment for hardcore " closer " fans			0
as for those of us who are @entity5 fans ? ambivalence reigns ! first of all , the exit of @entity3 's @entity23			1
( this is your spoiler alert			0
) " @entity1 " series finale brought closure to deputy chief @entity23 's career , as she faced off with her long - running arch - nemesis , the serial rapist @entity30 ( @entity31 )			1
then @entity23 abruptly accepted a new job ( something like chief of bureau of investigations @entity38 liason officer in the @entity40 's office -- it sounded like the longest - titled cushy job possible ) and lit out , munching a signature bit of junk food			1
over the years , " @entity1 " had become a light - comedy crime show with heavy - handed humor performed not just by @entity3 but also the supporting cast that has migrated over to " @entity8 , " especially @entity47 , whose slow burns have become endless fuming , and , only by contrast to a lesser extent , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity54			1
( i 've always found it interesting that @entity51 and @entity52 are veterans of two , need i say superior , @entity59 tv shows , @entity60 and @entity61 -- indeed , many of @entity52 's gestures and body language when he enters a crime scene strongly echo his moves in @entity61 , and i 'd bet that 's where he picked up those good habits , from @entity59 's heavily - researched series			2
) @entity73 books ' 90210 ' gig in previous guest - star turns , @entity5 's captain @entity74 has clashed with @entity23 and her crew , with her maddeningly ( to them ) methodical , by - the - book manner			1
me , i 've always found @entity74 's serene assurance a palliative to the twitchy eccentricity of @entity82 - winning @entity83 's @entity23			1
( as she proved on " @entity85 , " nobody does soothing sensibleness better than @entity5			2
) " @entity8 " went out of its way to announce , in one character 's words , " we 're changing the focus of [ the ] major crimes [ unit ] " -- that is , from a viewer 's vantage point , from an emphasis on the case - closing interrogation ( @entity23 's trademark speciality , from whence the earlier series got its title ) to , as a lawyer phrased it in " @entity8 ' " first hour , a " new deal - making paradigm that [ @entity74 ] wants to put in place			1
" me , i like this approach -- it 's closer to being the tv equivalent of a police procedural novel crossed with a legal thriller , if well - done			2
unfortunately , the first " @entity8 " suffered from obviousness and snail 's - pace plotting			2
' @entity111 ' back on @entity112 in other words , slow - and - steady ( and by - the - book ) wins the race ... but not necessarily the hearts of viewers			0
" @entity8 " is engineered to be as sober as @entity74 's dark horn - rim glasses , whereas " @entity1 " was as bright and lively as @entity23 's trench coats and candy wrappers			1
the new show tried to start something in @entity74 's personal life , with her taking in homeless @entity125 , but , boy , does that dynamic look dull			0
i am rooting for @entity5 to succeed on television once again			0
but she needs a better vehicle than this			0
she needs , deserves , a series at least as clever and complex as , say , " @entity132			0
" because i have some doubt that , a few weeks in , she and @entity134 are going to succeed with this good new boss			0
