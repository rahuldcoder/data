-- billionaire @entity2 prince @entity1 has reiterated his support for giving women the right to drive in @entity2 , announcing via @entity6 that it would help the economy and reduce the number of foreign workers there			1
" the question of women driving will result in being able to dispense with at least 500,000 ( foreign ) drivers , in addition to the social and economic benefits , " he tweeted sunday			1
in the deeply conservative kingdom , women are prohibited from driving , and many must rely on foreign drivers for transportation			1
women 's rights activist @entity22 said monday that she was glad to hear @entity1 's comments , but she did n't think it would amount to much			1
" we got used to him saying the right things but nothing happens , " she said			0
" i think he only makes headlines , but then nothing happens			0
" @entity31 said that while she found it interesting that @entity1 put the issue in terms of how much it was costing the country , she has " stopped following any news reports about women driving " until she hears it addressed by @entity36			1
@entity2 is home to around 9 million foreign workers			1
in recent weeks , thousands of them have been deported in a crackdown by authorities against illegal immigrants			0
last week , @entity2 @entity36 granted foreigners working there illegally a three - month grace period in order to legalize their status			2
@entity52 , one of the richest men in the world , is the nephew of @entity36 and is considered by some to be a champion of women 's rights and empowerment			2
last year , his wife , princess @entity58 , made headlines on the same issue when she spoke out , saying driving laws there should be reformed			2
" i think it 's a very easy decision , " she told @entity0 's @entity63 last september			0
" and it is for the government			0
a lot of people are saying this is a social issue			0
... education was a social issue			0
and a lot of people in @entity2 were against women getting educated			1
yet the decision was made			0
" there are no specific traffic laws that make it illegal for women to drive in @entity2			1
however , religious edicts are often interpreted as prohibiting female drivers			0
such edicts also prevent women from opening bank accounts , obtaining passports or even going to school without the presence of a male guardian			0
in 2011 , a group called @entity89 began a campaign demanding that women be given the right to drive in @entity2			1
the movement was sparked by the arrest that year of @entity95 , a @entity2 technology consultant and mother who was detained for nine days for driving her own car			2
many of her supporters posted videos and pictures of themselves online driving in various @entity2 cities .			2

@entity1 says move would help the economy , reduce the number of foreign workers
but activist says it will mean more when @entity2 's king addresses the issue

in 2011 , the group @entity89 demanded that women be given the right to drive in the country
