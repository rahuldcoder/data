-- as smoke clears from two deadly bombings near the finish line of the @entity5 on monday , focus turns to identifying those responsible			0
and that 's no easy task			0
the massive number of cell phones and closed circuit cameras on the street provide an incredible wealth of video and photo			1
" this is probably one of the most well photographed areas in the country , " said @entity16 police commissioner @entity15			1
the wealth of photographic and video evidence available is both a challenge and an opportunity			1
" we intend to go through every frame			1
" the @entity16 marathon extends over 26 miles of streets and is largely open to the public			1
the crime scene around the bombing covers 12 city blocks			2
" this is the most complex crime scene we 've ever had to deal with , " said @entity15 at a press conference tuesday about the bombings			0
" we are processing all the digital photographic evidence we can , " says @entity37 , the special agent leading the @entity39 's @entity38			0
he asks that " the public continue submitting whatever they have to police			2
" there 's a huge amount of video evidence to process , he says , creating a logistics issue			2
@entity48 is a forensic video analyst and instructor at the @entity52 and @entity51 ( @entity53 ) in @entity54			2
@entity53 is the only digital multimedia evidence processing lab in the world designed to train video investigators and analyze massive amounts of forensic video evidence , @entity48 says			2
which is exactly what 's needed in @entity16			1
@entity48 says there 's no standard in law enforcement to acquire video from the public in the wake of a tragedy such as yesterday 's marathon bombings			2
but the best example of mass video collection for investigative purposes occurred in june 2011 , when riots occurred after the @entity74 lost the @entity76 finals to the @entity77			1
the @entity78 of @entity79 set up a system in which the public could provide video evidence , such as photos and videos from cell phones , anonymously to police			1
in response , @entity79 police received 5,000 hours of video from the public			1
considering the size of the @entity5 and the growing prevalence of smartphone video cameras , the raw volume of footage after this tragedy could be much larger			1
after gathering those 5,000 hours of footage , @entity79 police then contacted leva through the @entity98 to go through all that video			1
@entity48 says 52 analysts then spent 14 days processing that footage , identifying 15,000 criminal acts perpetrated by 300 rioters			1
the analysis is not magic , @entity48 says			0
three shifts of video forensics experts distributed the raw video evidence to analysts , who then put the evidence into a single interoperable format , and uploaded it into a central management system			2
from there , it was watched and coded — meaning that anyone perceived to commit a criminal act was profiled and then attached to a special code that would identify , for example , whether they were wearing a backpack or a hoodie , whether they were carrying anything with them , and any other physical attributes that could be identified			1
( @entity0 describes the first potential suspect in the @entity126 as " seen with a black backpack and sweatshirt " and " trying to get into a restricted area about five minutes before the first explosion			0
" ) the purpose of this is to tag people so they can be identified later — to say , " hey , this is the same person " identified in previous videos , he says			0
@entity48 notes that @entity16 police are likely now going through a similar process , collecting every piece of digital media available from transit and nearly 600 closed circuit television cameras covering the @entity142 alone			1
according to the @entity149 of @entity150 , " stored video can be easily shared with other [ police departments ] over standard web browsers using a system protected by a basic username and password			1
" in a post tuesday , @entity151 quoted the study , inferring : " if the bomber ( s ) took public transportation , there 's a good chance those steps can be retraced through video footage			1
" but does this profiling open the possibility for wrongful arrests ? recall the tragedy of @entity164 , the security guard falsely accused of bombing @entity166 's @entity165 during the @entity167			0
" the thing about profiling is that you 're not profiling an individual , you 're profiling a type , " @entity48 says			0
in @entity16 , authorities are now combing video evidence for " anyone with a backpack			1
" in other words , it 's not the video analyst 's role to worry about whether people are wrongly accused of involvement in the @entity126 ; it 'll be up to law enforcement to get evidence before they start arresting people			2
" the video officer is just a technician , " @entity48 says			2
in an email to @entity190 , @entity191 , a video analyst with @entity193 in @entity194 , sees where improvements might be made in the future to make the process easier			0
" what needs to be developed is a solution for governments to accept public video and images for such situations , as there were likely several @entity208 who captured evidence , " he writes , referencing the famous film of the @entity200 assassination			1
" it needs to be far more comprehensive and useful than just random submissions to the 911 centers			0
" he suggests that such a system should accept wireless , web , and email submissions when activated			0
each submission should include basic contact information , camera info , as well as a time sync reference			0
" this would provide a quick bigger picture , " @entity191 writes			0
and beyond the video evidence , @entity48 says federal authorities will already have a list of potential terror suspects who could be involved			1
" they 'll ask , ' who 's in town , who are we tracking ? ' " those people become instant suspects before video evidence is analysed			0
" the message is this : the most prolific source of evidence available to law enforcement comes from video evidence , comes from video sources , " he says			0
" these kinds of cases really underscore that the general public is collecting video evidence every moment of every day			0
so when you have a major incident in a major area like this where you have a huge gathering of the public , everyone there with a cell phone now has an evidence collection device that can be used by law enforcement			0
" " law enforcement just needs to get that video			0
" @entity266 : " the @entity39 has set up a tip line — at 1 - 800 - call - @entity39 — for anyone who has information , images , or details relating to yesterday 's explosions along the @entity5 route			0
we are particularly interested in reviewing video footage captured by bystanders with cell phones or personal cameras near either of the blasts			1
in an investigation of this nature , no detail is too small			0

the many cell phones and cameras on @entity16 streets give authorities a wealth of images
police : " we intend to go through every frame "
authorities are asking witnesses for photos and video that might offer clues to the bomber
@entity79 police used video footage to identify criminal acts after 2011 riots in that city
