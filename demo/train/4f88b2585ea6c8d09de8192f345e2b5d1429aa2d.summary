-- who knew that 70 years after @entity3 pilots had to work hard to overcome the prejudices of whites in the @entity7 armed services , and the nation having its first black commander - in - chief , the men known as the @entity10 would still be doing battle with an entrenched institution of white power brokers , all based on the color of their skin			1
many of you may have seen the flashy commercials advertising " @entity20 , " the major motion picture that chronicles the amazing and true story of true @entity3 heroes : black pilots who went overseas in @entity25 to fight for the freedom and democracy that they could not enjoy at home			1
the film opens january 20 in theaters nationwide , and for its producer , @entity31 , it has been a 23 - year odyssey			1
you would think that someone considered one of the most powerful players in @entity36 , a man who has made billions with blockbusters such as the " @entity39 " and " @entity40 " franchises , would have been able to get " @entity20 " approved without any hesitation			1
yet many african - americans have long known that in @entity36 , the color of your skin -- or that of the people in the story you want to tell -- often falls victim to racial pigeonholing			1
oh , sure , @entity36 is seen as a liberal bastion where folks talk about equality and supporting civil rights , but when it comes to telling stories that have mostly black casts , @entity36 might as well return to the ' 50s and ' 60s and erect signs that say " whites only			1
" when @entity31 approached the major @entity36 studios about backing " @entity20 , " he was told : thanks , but no thanks			1
" there 's no major white roles in it at all ... i showed it to all of them and they said no , we do n't know how to market a movie like this , " @entity31 told @entity66 on @entity67			1
let 's juxtapose that against some other facts : -- in 2008 , 69 million people voted for @entity78 as president of the @entity7 ; -- the most talked - about woman in @entity7 over the past 25 years was @entity81 , who redefined the talk show genre ; -- which athlete has the top - selling jersey in the @entity85 ? @entity86 ; -- who is considered the top - grossing actor ? @entity89 ; -- arguably the greatest entertainer of all time is @entity92 ; -- the greatest golfer in the world ? @entity95 ; -- the most dominating players in women 's tennis ? @entity99 and @entity100 ; -- the top singer today ? @entity102 ; -- and hip - hop , an outgrowth of black culture , is a worldwide phenemonon			2
and 80 % of the consumers of hip - hop music in @entity7 are white kids			0
so whites all across @entity7 have come to accept african - americans in a variety of public media , but @entity36 continues to want to tell us that somehow seeing blacks on the big screen is anathema to their values			1
maybe what no one in @entity36 wants to own up to is that in many ways , it is a close - minded society where it 's hard to find african - americans in positions of true power			1
in the history of @entity36 , no @entity3 has ever headed a major studio			1
yes , we 've seen black ceos at @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and other major companies , but the doors of opportunity are closed in @entity36			1
does this mean @entity3 - @entity3 are n't hired ? no. but those are low - level positions where they desperately fight the good fight , knowing full well they will never ascend to the top of the food chain in @entity36			1
part of @entity36 's problem is that when looking at a movie that has , like " @entity20 , " a mostly black cast , it is cast as a " black " film			1
" @entity20 " is n't a black movie			1
it 's a war movie			0
it 's an action movie			0
it 's a story of true @entity3 heroes overcoming great odds to succeed			0
that was the conclusion of @entity155 head football coach , @entity154 , who showed the film to his team the night before they demolished @entity158 for the @entity160 national title			0
did @entity154 conclude it was a black film ? not at all , and he gave it a resounding endorsement			2
this racial fight may be new to @entity31 , but to african - americans , this has been a long and painful battle			1
a few months ago on my @entity167 sunday show , @entity168 , i talked with actor @entity169 , who has starred in " @entity170 , " " fighting " and the critically - acclaimed tv show , " @entity172			0
" he told a stunning story that shows the ignorance of @entity36 regarding an independent movie he starred in with @entity178 , " @entity179			2
" " @entity180 , the writer , director and producer , is a @entity183 man who had some friends , " @entity169 said			0
" his friend @entity185 was the inspiration for @entity187 and dr. @entity188 -- a @entity190 - educated doctor that was involved with the film			2
and @entity180 sold this great script to the studios , but he left the character descriptions out			0
" when the studios found out the leads were black , they did n't want to make the movie anymore , and @entity180 had to go take his own money and his friends ' money and make this movie himself and then start the long road to getting a distribution deal			2
" this is n't just the big studios			0
the @entity207 produced " @entity208 , " a basketball film about two teams coming together in the wake of @entity212 to win the @entity214 state championship			0
yet the movie went straight to @entity216 , angering lead actor @entity217 , and others in the film , including @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and the rapper @entity223			0
the excuse given the actors ? the @entity207 said they did n't know how to market the film			2
a movie with basketball at the center of the story ? folks , come on ! @entity36 defenders will be quick to say , what about @entity234 ? @entity235 ? @entity236 ? what 's interesting in @entity36 is that if you 're @entity234 , @entity235 or a handful of others , you really are n't seen as " black			1
" for them , they have crossed the post-racial threshold , and in @entity36 's eyes , white america will watch them			2
but if you talk to them and so many other top @entity36 actors , they will also tell you stories of having doors slammed in their faces , and trying to get movies made featuring mostly blacks and were told , " ca n't you make the characters white ? " what is also at play is that for @entity36 , having one black guy in a film that has mostly whites is never called a white film			1
but if it 's one or two white guys in a film with mostly blacks -- uh oh , black film ! the latest excuse offered up by the @entity36 studios is that " black films " do n't sell well overseas			1
what that means is that foreigners also do n't want to see @entity3			0
again , i believe the problem is how the movies are categorized			0
let 's take two black men dressing up as women			0
when @entity279 does it in " @entity281 , " that is n't marketed as a " black film			2
" as a result , it grossed $ 117.5 million in the @entity7 and $ 56.4 million worldwide			0
yet @entity292 's " @entity291 , " another movie featuring a black guy dressed as a grandmother , did $ 90 million in the @entity7 , and they did n't even bother to show it overseas			0
maybe that 's because @entity292 's " @entity296 's @entity295 " only did $ 50,000 in ticket sales worldwide three years earlier , and $ 63.2 million in the @entity7 now , if @entity36 knows how to sell white men dressed as women ( @entity300 in " @entity301 " and @entity302 in " @entity303 " ) along with largely white casts , they ca n't figure out how to do the same for a @entity292 ? @entity31 has clearly expressed his fears with " @entity20 , " hoping it opens huge so it will send a message to @entity36 that a big - budget action film with lots of black folks can be successful			1
the downside ? if it fails , it will be seen as a failure of all black action films			2
several @entity36 executives told me that when the @entity315 helmed film , " @entity317 , " did n't meet expectations and only grossed $ 21.5 million -- it was marketed as a black film -- the result was a virtual shutdown of all romantic comedies featuring african - americans			1
yet @entity324 can put out failed romantic comedy after failed romantic comedy , and no one says " white " romantic comedies should end			0
have we returned to the days of @entity330 when he could n't fail because if he did , the whole race would be set back ? that 's essentially what @entity36 is saying			0
i want you to go and see " @entity20 " not because it is an historical depiction of a true period in @entity7 , but because it 's one helluva film			2
the action scenes are first rate and the storytelling is superb			0
are the main characters black ? yep			0
just do as i do when i go and see a movie that features an all - white cast , which is most of the time : go for the enjoyment			2
if so , maybe the libs in @entity36 will finally realize that great stories , when sold as such , and not as a " black " film , can bring people of all stripes to the movie theater			1
there used to be a time when whites could sit downstairs , and if blacks were allowed in the movie theater , had to sit upstairs			0
today , it 's clear that such a racial divide is no longer in place in the seats , but now on the screen , and that 's a damn shame .			0

@entity31 has been on a 23 - year odyssey to get " @entity20 " into theaters
the @entity25 action film features a *predominantly* black cast
@entity36 has a rocky history with *perceived* " black " films , @entity371 says
the studios should market good movies , not pigeonhole them , @entity371 says
