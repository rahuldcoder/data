@entity0 -- in a small gun range 20 minutes outside @entity0 , a steady stream of gun enthusiasts fill the air with the scent of gunpowder and the sharp bang of shots			0
many of the customers -- a range of ex-military men , off - duty law enforcement officers and a sprinkling of women learning how to handle a firearm for self - protection -- said they have grown up around guns and are leery of interference by the federal government on gun rights			0
" just like drug use is illegal but people still get their hands on drugs -- so , the bad guys are still going to have guns , " said @entity23 , who came from a family of @entity25			0
" well , i 'm going to have a gun too			0
" sen. @entity33 ( @entity34 ) is well aware of those concerns			1
the veteran @entity36 will face her states ' voters in a 2014 election , and despite her three terms in the @entity42 , @entity33 's seat is widely considered vulnerable			1
@entity1 poll : importance of guns soars , as do gun owner concerns she has already drawn a @entity49 challenger , who has worked to tie @entity33 to the policies of president @entity51 and charged she does not represent the views of many in this deeply red @entity55 state			1
@entity33 , in an interview with @entity1 during a small business event in @entity58 , emphasized her independence from @entity60			0
despite the president 's aggressive support for expanding background checks for gun purchasers , @entity33 said she has not decided whether she 'll support a @entity42 bill on the matter			1
background checks on gun sales : how do they work ? when asked about recent polls finding 90 % of @entity71 support universal background checks , @entity33 said : " i do n't know what the number is in @entity34			1
" " i 'm not the president of the @entity71 , i 'm the senator from @entity34 , " @entity33 said			2
" so i really will follow what the people in my state want me to do on that issue			2
" @entity33 said she would n't weigh in on background checks " until i see the bills and then i 'll decide how i 'm going to vote			1
but there 's no question about my support for the @entity85			0
" @entity1 poll : background checks popular , worrisome months after the massacre of elementary school students in @entity91 , @entity92 , there is intense pressure for @entity94 to address gun violence			1
a third - party group , @entity99 mayor @entity98 's @entity96 , has rolled out an ad in @entity34 urging @entity33 to support new gun legislation			1
the group has also directed spots at other lawmakers on the fence about reforms , including several other @entity107 up for re-election in 2014			0
and there are some signs that a bill like one announced by a bipartisan group of senators wednesday on background checks may be more palatable to voters			2
a @entity117 poll released in early april found 91 % of voters across the country support universal background checks			1
" i think we should be doing that anyway			0
i think that 's part of our responsibility , " said @entity124 , a @entity25 who works in law enforcement and supports expanding the background check system			0
" i think responsible gun owners would agree that 's a reasonable request that our government or local law enforcement put on us			0
when you start going past that is when i think people get nervous about it or have strong feelings one way or the other , " @entity124 said			0
before the play date , the gun talk as the @entity42 prepares to consider gun legislation as early as thursday , @entity33 will have to cast a vote			2
" if there is a lot of support and we can get background checks done and not infringe on the right of people to own guns or to pass them down to their children or grandchildren , we 'll figure out a way to do that , " @entity33 said			1
" i do know that people in @entity34 want the right to own a gun and feel that it 's , you know , part of our culture and history , and we 're not going to infringe upon that right			2

sen. @entity33 is a *conservative* @entity36 representing the red state of @entity34
" i really will follow what the people in my state want me to do " on gun control , she said
this despite national polls that show 90 % support background checks
