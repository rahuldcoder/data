-- the announcement by senior @entity4 military and government officials that an agreement has been reached with @entity6 for the release of more than 200 kidnapped @entity9 girls is welcome , although it has understandably been greeted with considerable caution			1
and news that a ceasefire has also been agreed , and that further negotiations will take place , is another positive development			2
but this is a case when we will actually need to see the girls emerging from their six - month confinement before we can truly believe			0
after all , it was only recently that it was announced that @entity22 , reputed leader of the jihadist group , had supposedly been killed ... again			0
yet @entity22 , or someone proclaiming to be him , probably lives on in a country where much political , economic and now military affairs take place in the shadows			0
the problem with establishing what is really going on in @entity4 , and with @entity6 specifically , is that after five years of warfare and many casualties , there is much that is still uncertain about the group			1
indeed , it appears to be both an actual organization and a brand name for banditry			0
early reports have claimed that the meetings that resulted in the alleged agreement with @entity6 took place in @entity44 , the capital of neighboring @entity45 , which itself is firmly under the control of an autocratic government			1
but it is difficult to know for sure what is going on in @entity4 , a place where a significant part of business is conducted by a shadowy combination of political , military , and business individuals			0
and this is creating even bigger problems for @entity4 than the national and global demands for the girls ' rescue			2
for a start , it has been unclear how @entity6 is financed -- and how much assistance it might be receiving from disaffected members of the northern @entity4 elite , as well as those holding government positions at the federal and state levels			1
" @entity73 " campaigns involving the use of armed thugs have been a staple feature of @entity4 party politics for decades , and international human rights groups have noted a " dirty war " conducted by soldiers and government - financed militias			0
these abuses , combined with the dysfunction of the armed forces , complicate external assistance			0
the problem for @entity4 is that although the jihadists will eventually almost certainly be crushed , as were the secessionists in @entity4 's civil war , the clock is ticking on a greater threat to the @entity4 nation , namely popular protests in northern @entity4 following february 's presidential poll , which president @entity94 is certain to contest			1
@entity6 is a militant , cultist variant of @entity96 , and it continues to challenge the secular @entity4 state			1
its campaign has tapped into widespread disaffection in the northern region of at least 80 million people , which has been in decline even as the rest of the country experiences economic growth			0
this is the backdrop to the unfolding drama of the kidnapped girls , who themselves have become pawns in a multilayered drama			2
if the negotiations announced friday are genuine , @entity6 -- which has muscled its way onto the global stage by mimicking jihadist declarations and terrorist actions of others , including the use of suicide bombers -- can command a high price for their release			1
while the group is still largely a @entity4 phenomenon , and although such militant groups have previously been overwhelmed by the brutal force for which @entity4 soldiers and police are known , @entity6 is more tenacious and resilient than its predecessors			1
moreover , it is now fortified by a powerful global jihadist ideology			2
so , how should the @entity4 government respond ? friday 's announcement suggests that the @entity9 girls are alive and well ; and a rational course for @entity6 would be to negotiate an amnesty with the government , following the example of the @entity139 insurgents			1
but the announcement , if it can be believed , has implications that stretch beyond these girls ' fortunes			0
indeed , the campaign for the @entity4 presidency has effectively merged with the campaign to defeat @entity6			2
this means that if the government is successful in brokering a lasting ceasefire with @entity6 and bringing home these girls , @entity94 would undoubtedly get a significant boost in his reelection efforts			1
with a multi-billion government trough at his disposal , it would be hard to bet against him come february			0
but the way this " deal " unfolds will have significant implications for his electoral chances and the peace and political stability of @entity166 's largest nation .			0

@entity6 has reportedly agreed to free more than 200 *schoolgirls* who were kidnapped earlier this year
@entity6 has muscled its way onto global stage by mimicking terrorist actions of others , @entity170 says
president @entity94 would benefit politically from any deal , he says
