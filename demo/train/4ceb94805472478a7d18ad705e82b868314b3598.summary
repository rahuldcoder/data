" i 'm really happy with this pole position , particularly as earning it was a little different to my previous poles , " @entity1 was quoted as saying by @entity2 's official website			1
" at the start of qualifying there were two completely wet corners , which made it hard to put in a hot lap as we had to calculate the amount of risk while still maintaining our speed			0

" @entity1 was docked a third point this season for colliding with @entity47 teammate @entity20 at the @entity48 last month and if he is deducted a fourth point , he 'll have to start a race at the back of the grid			1
