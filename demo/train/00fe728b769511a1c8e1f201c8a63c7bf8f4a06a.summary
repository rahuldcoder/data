-- the midflight breakdown of a @entity3 pilot has sparked concerns about psychological screening for flight crews			1
capt. @entity8 's erratic behavior prompted flight 191 from @entity10 to @entity11 to make an unscheduled landing in @entity13 , @entity14 , on tuesday after crew and passengers intervened and subdued the 49 - year - old pilot			1
@entity8 " yelled jumbled comments about @entity19 , september 11th , @entity20 , @entity21 , and terrorists , " according to a federal criminal complaint filed against @entity8			0
one passenger quoted @entity8 as saying , " @entity26 --- --- now for @entity19 , " the complaint said			0
" it just seemed like something triggered him to go off the wall			0
he would be calm one minute and then just all of a sudden turn , " said passenger @entity30			0
@entity3 pilot charged with interfering with flight crew @entity3 has not elaborated on the pilot 's condition , but ceo @entity36 referred to the incident as a " medical situation			1
" the pilot 's behavior points to possible psychological distress , doctors say			1
the episode could be the result of bipolar disorder or a recent start on antidepressant medication , said dr. @entity48 , a psychiatrist at the @entity49 and @entity0 consultant who has not treated @entity8			0
medical illnesses such as brain tumors , subtle seizures or hormonal imbalances could also have caused @entity8 's behavior , @entity48 said			1
all airline pilots are required by the @entity57 to have a first - class medical certificate that must be renewed annually for pilots younger than 40 and every six months for pilots 40 and older			1
@entity3 follows all @entity57 pilot requirements , the airline said			1
pilots must be examined by an aviation medical examiner as part of that process , and a candidate 's psychological condition is assessed			1
the exam does not include a formal psychiatric evaluation , although the examiner should " form a general impression of the emotional stability and mental state of the applicant , " according to @entity57 's @entity76			1
bipolar disorders , psychotic disorders , personality disorders that involve " acting out " and substance dependence generally are disqualifying conditions , according to the guide			0
in these cases , the examiner would either deny issuing the certificate or defer it and report evidence of significant problems to the @entity57 , the guide says			1
" if the person is exhibiting any signs of psychosis , thinks he 's on the moon , is disoriented in time and place , if he 's taking any medicines -- and the @entity57 is very strict -- the computer wo n't even let me give an exam if medicines are not approved			1
it 's very strict under those circumstances , " said dr. @entity101 , an @entity57 - approved @entity10 family doctor who performs about 40 pilot exams a year			1
@entity101 said one pilot grieving the death of his father raised a red flag for him and he deferred certification to the @entity57			1
" pilots as a rule are extremely stable people , " said retired airline capt. @entity110 , a 33 - year veteran			2
" by the time a person becomes a commercial pilot , they 've gone through so many filters			2
" however , the agency 's strict criteria prompt some to hide their conditions , according to two pilots who spoke to @entity0 on condition of anonymity out of concern for their own careers			2
one veteran with three decades of experience said he 's known just a single fellow pilot who sought treatment for depression			1
the treatment lasted eight or nine months , and he never told his employer , the pilot said			2
" a guy has worked his whole career toward what he 's gotten , and he 's dealing with issues , what does he do ? if he says , ' hey , i 'm depressed , ' then the @entity57 pulls his medical certificates and then there goes his career			1
" another veteran pilot echoed that sentiment : " yes , pilots are flying around depressed because if they do ( admit depression ) , they 'll be grounded			1
" " pilots are generally well psychologically screened for all the right reasons			2
if this pilot did indeed snap , it does n't surprise me			2
there 's tremendous pressure out there in the pilot group , and that 's something the public should care about , " the pilot said			0
in its medical examiners guide , the @entity57 says pilots being treated with four specific antidepressants may receive medical clearance , which would be decided on a case - by - case basis			1
@entity8 's breakdown comes just weeks after an @entity166 flight attendant 's behavior alarmed passengers and prompted flight crew members to restrain her while the plane was taxiing			0
one passenger said the flight attendant described herself as bipolar and said she had not taken her medication			0
other accounts referred to her talking on the intercom about the plane crashing			0
@entity166 has not identified her , and no charges have been filed			0
she remains employed by the company , the airline said wednesday			0
@entity181 said the airline follows all @entity57 rules			2
unlike pilots , flight attendants are not required to pass medical examinations before they fly , according to the @entity186 , a union that does not represent @entity166 workers			2
" however , flight attendants do have to go through recurrent training each year to refresh their emergency situation skills , " said @entity186 spokeswoman @entity188			0
they are also required to receive proficiency certification from the @entity57			2
she added that " in most cases , " flight attendants could be treated for various conditions and still perform " as first responders efficiently , " noting that red flags would probably come up during the initial six - to eight - week training period or during a probationary period of up to a year			0
in addition to the pressure of performing the duties of flying itself , airline employees face the added stress of trying to survive in an industry fraught with restructuring , bankruptcies and other uncertainties			0
" this industry is very turbulent , " @entity188 said			0
" and after 9/11 , these workers really went through a very difficult time personally and professionally			0
" @entity0 's @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
