@entity0 -- counterfeit capsules of the diet drug @entity4 that are sold online can pose a serious health risk to some users , a research director from the @entity8 said saturday			1
the @entity8 warned consumers this week that fake versions of the over-the - counter drug are being sold , mainly on online auction sites			1
testing shows that the counterfeit pills contain excessive amounts of sibutramine , a prescription drug and controlled substance that can place people with cardiovascular disease at risk for higher blood pressure , heart attack or stroke , said @entity25 , director of the @entity26			1
the fake pills contain at least twice as much sibutramine as would normally be recommended , she said			2
" unfortunately , many people with high blood pressure or heart disease are trying to improve their health by losing weight , and we are concerned that such individuals might be exposed to the counterfeit drug , " @entity25 said			2
@entity25 said possible symptoms of excess sibutramine are heart palpitations , sleeplessness , anxiety , dry mouth , nausea and shakiness			1
she said the @entity8 has received about two dozen calls from people reporting these symptoms			2
according to @entity50 's web site , sibutramine is the active ingredient in the prescription diet drug @entity53			1
" @entity53 could potentially interact with other medications the consumer may be taking , and there are dosing differences between @entity4 ( three times a day ) and @entity53 ( once a day ) , " the site says			0
analysis also shows that the counterfeit pills lack the active ingredient orlistat found in the authentic @entity4 product , which prevents a portion of the fat eaten from being absorbed , @entity50 's web site says			1
instead , the fat passes directly through the digestive system and is eliminated			0
according to @entity50 , which is made by @entity69 , @entity70 - based pharmaceutical giant @entity71 , consumers should watch for these signs in determining whether the product they are buying is fake : @entity76 code information is missing from the top of the box			0
the expiration date includes month , day and year ( example : 06162010 ) , instead of only the month and year ( example : 05/12 )			0
the seal on the bottle should read " @entity86 " in white ink on the real @entity4 bottle ; this statement is not present on the fake product			0
the counterfeit capsule is slightly larger , and its content is powdery ; the genuine capsule is shaped more like a pellet .			0

excess sibutramine can cause heart palpitations , sleeplessness , nausea
fake pills also lack active ingredient in real diet drug
