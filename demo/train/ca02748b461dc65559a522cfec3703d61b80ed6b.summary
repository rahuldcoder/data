-- a day after jurors found her guilty of first - degree murder , @entity1 and her attorneys met with a judge in a closed - door hearing thursday , according to a source with knowledge of the proceedings			1
the hearing was sealed , and it 's unclear what they discussed			1
but afterward , officials abruptly announced the cancellation of thursday 's court proceedings and said that the trial would not resume until next week			1
the last - minute cancellation was the latest twist in a high - profile case that has been marked by drama so intense that spectators line up to get seats in the @entity26 courtroom			0
court proceedings are now scheduled to resume on wednesday at 10 a.m. ( 1 p.m. et )			0
that 's because the prosecution 's witness , medical examiner dr. @entity31 , is not available monday or tuesday , the source with knowledge of the proceedings said			0
although it was not immediately clear what prompted the unexpected scheduling change , some analysts pointed to a television interview @entity38 gave minutes after the verdict was announced wednesday			1

" i believe death is the ultimate freedom , so i 'd rather just have my freedom as soon as i can get it			2
" @entity38 told @entity41 that longevity runs in her family , and that the worst possible outcome in the case would be a life sentence without parole			1
" i would much rather die sooner than later , " she said			0

but the trial is n't over yet			2
and @entity38 , who testified for 18 days during the trial , could speak to jurors again in court			1

and in terms of these blessings , well , she knocked the blessings out of him by putting a bullet in his head			0
" photos : @entity86 and his girlfriend but defense attorney @entity160 countered : " @entity1 killed @entity1			2
there is no question about it			0
