so it looks like @entity1 , a white man who fatally shot black teenager @entity2 for refusing to turn down his " thug music , " may be going to prison for the rest of his life			1
but that 's a consolation prize			0
it 's not a real victory because the jury that convicted @entity1 , 47 , did n't convict him for killing the 17 - year - old @entity2			1
they convicted him for almost killing @entity2 ' three friends who were riding in the @entity14 with him			1
they found @entity1 guilty of three counts of second - degree attempted murder and one count of shooting deadly missiles			1
each attempted murder count carries a minimum sentence of 20 years			1
but it 's a hollow victory			1
it 's hollow because it means that , in 21st century @entity28 , the notion that a mouthy young black male could be a threat carries more weight with some people than the fact that an impulsive middle - aged white man could be a liar			2
apparently someone on the @entity1 jury -- a jury that took four days to deadlock on whether @entity1 was justified in killing @entity2 -- believed that @entity2 ' cursing at @entity1 and arguing over the volume of his music equaled a serious enough threat to make @entity1 reasonably fear for his life			1
gunman ' in disbelief ' over loud - music verdict someone on that jury saw @entity2 with a shotgun that likely never existed , but did n't see the real bullets -- 10 in all -- that @entity1 pumped into the suv and into @entity2 ' body , bullets that left @entity2 bleeding and dying in his friend 's lap. it 's hollow because it underscores what seems to be a scary trend			1
i guess now any random white man can confront a black teenager whose style of dress or music he does n't like or views as suspect			0
and when that teenager does n't submit to him , or responds to him in a confrontational manner , or in a way that any rebellious teenager is apt to respond , then it 's perfectly fine to exterminate him			0
see evidence in case we first saw this with @entity75			0
@entity75 was walking to his father 's home when @entity78 took it upon himself to follow him because he was wearing a hoodie			0
yet just as @entity78 thought @entity75 looked suspicious , the 17 - year - old thought @entity78 looked suspicious			1
but when @entity75 responded to @entity78 's stalking and wound up in a fight with him , @entity78 fatally shot him			0
and he got away with it			0
@entity78 claimed self - defense			1
in a confrontation that he provoked			0
so did @entity1 with @entity2			1
@entity1 took it upon himself to drive up to a convenience store in @entity89 and , even with a number of empty spaces available , decide to park next to the one vehicle full of young black men playing some thumping hip - hop music			2
rather than avoid music he hated , he parked right next to it			0
and when @entity2 did n't submit to his wishes to turn it down , he did n't like it			2
he did n't like that			0
@entity1 was not going to be sassed by a black kid			2
so @entity1 reached into his glove compartment , pulled out his 9 mm handgun and started shooting at @entity2 and his friends			2
verdict evokes mixed reactions yet this jury believed that the unarmed black teenager , @entity2 , was so scary , so profane that they could n't see their way to convict @entity1 of murdering him			1
so even though @entity1 is going to prison , it 's tough to feel good about the verdict			2
what the verdict says is that in this nation , in the 21st century , some white men still believe they have the right to intrude into the space of young black men and make demands			0
and if the black man is unarmed -- with no weapon except his words -- those white men can still kill him			0
and call it self - defense			2
all they need is a jury to buy it .			0

@entity131 calls the verdict in the @entity1 murder case a hollow victory
@entity1 *admitted* firing into an suv , killing @entity2 , 17 , but said it was in self - defense
@entity1 was found guilty of three counts of second - degree attempted murder
the @entity145 jury could not reach a verdict in the murder charge for @entity2 ' death
