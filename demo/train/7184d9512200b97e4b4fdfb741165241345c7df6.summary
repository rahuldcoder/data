-- singer @entity2 's recent decision to cancel a tour to care for her dying dog , @entity5 , brought an outpouring of support from dog owners who could relate all too well to the need to honor their beloved companions until the very end			1
as @entity0 's @entity18 recently wrote in a tribute to her late @entity20 , @entity21 : " dogs express their love and trust in many ways -- some lap at your face , knock you down with kisses as you come home , leave a half - dead animal on your pillow , or sit on your lap and sigh with contentment			1
the large and stoic ones tend to lean			2
it 's the best feeling in the universe			2
" we saw a well of sympathy in response to @entity18 's story , like from the commenter who said , " my doggies never hold grudges , shun me , argue with me , they give love , laughter , constancy and protection			2
how can one not love and honor such behavior ? that means returning the favor no matter what that takes			0
" after reading the comments on @entity18 's essay , @entity49 decided to invite dog owners to share their stories about the animals they loved and lost			1
the assignment turned into a wake of sorts for owners -- many for whom the loss was still fresh -- to share their best times with their furry pals and their last moments together			0
" the love of an animal is something you ca n't define or even describe			0
no judgement , no questions , no pity ; just love and cuddles and slobbery kisses , and the occasional ' woo ' with a fire siren at 3 a.m , " @entity68 said in her tribute to her golden retriever , @entity71 , who died in april			0
