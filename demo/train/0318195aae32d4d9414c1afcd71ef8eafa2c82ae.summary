-- as the violence intensifies in @entity4 , external powers , including the @entity2 , are embracing increasingly belligerent positions			1
indeed , in recent days the @entity2 and @entity6 have announced plans to study a no - fly zone after calls by many @entity2 commentators for a more direct military role			0
although there is no doubt the government of president @entity17 carries the overwhelming responsibility for the unfolding tragedy in @entity4 , the attempt to militarily defeat the regime is the wrong strategy if the goals are reducing violence and protecting innocent civilians			1
the best strategy for those who wish to avoid a protracted war in @entity4 is to bring @entity27 and @entity28 to the international diplomatic table			1
@entity27 and @entity28 participation are essential to a viable post-al - @entity17 transition ; the alternative , a transitional plan generated exclusively by the @entity2 and its allies , can be accomplished only through force			1
to insist on the military path without engaging @entity17 's backers is to condemn @entity39 civilians to escalating violence in pursuit of regime change			2
to date , external backers of the two sides have focused on arming their local proxies rather than negotiating			0
@entity27 and @entity28 have reiterated their commitment to the @entity17 government , both diplomatically and through direct support			1
recent reports suggest that the @entity2 has doubled down on funding the rebels with a secret presidential order authorizing military assistance ( stopping short for now of actual " lethal aid , " which has been outsourced to @entity54 and @entity55 , in coordination with @entity6 )			0
the current confrontational approach is unsurprising , because toppling the @entity39 regime would alter the regional balance of power against @entity28 and in favor of @entity62 governments			1
until quite recently the @entity2 was prepared to partner with the @entity17 regime , however repressive : the country played a well - documented role in the @entity2 ' extraordinary rendition of terrorism suspects			1
but with the @entity2 and @entity69 contemplating an attack on @entity28 's nuclear facilities , wresting control of @entity4 from an @entity28 supporter and severing links between @entity75 and @entity76 are strategic goals served by assistance to the rebels			1
opinion : @entity4 's chemical weapons threat demands a response unfortunately , removing an @entity28 ally in @entity4 may look like low - cost regime change , but it will be more costly in the long run than most analysts suppose , and in the short run these policies are likely to contribute to a drawn out and increasingly bloody civil war			1
as recent weeks have shown , the rebels have only begun to achieve parity through indiscriminate armed attacks , often resulting in as many casualties among civilians as among the ostensible targets			0
even with additional arms , opposition groups resisting @entity17 's repression may fight the regime only to a standstill			2
more direct @entity2 military involvement to shift the balance decisively in favor of the rebels would be even more damaging			0
in order to defeat the regime militarily , the @entity2 and its allies would have to dramatically heighten the magnitude of destruction wrought on the country , resulting in greater civilian casualties			1
they would also confront complications absent in @entity115 as a result of @entity4 's strategically sensitive location , much larger population , and greater demographic diversity and internal tensions			0
for these very reasons , @entity2 government preparations for the post-al - @entity17 fallout use @entity123 rather than @entity115 as the relevant comparison			1
unfortunately , the current international approach seems more likely to repeat rather than avoid @entity2 mistakes in @entity123			1
by funneling weapons to the rebels through regional actors , the rebels ' external backers are setting the stage for escalating sectarian conflict -- even ethnic cleansing -- pitting @entity136 constituencies backed by @entity6 , @entity54 and @entity55 against opponents that they increasingly identify in sectarian terms as @entity140 rather than regime supporters			0
the result is a deeply destabilized @entity4 bordering on @entity69 , @entity6 , @entity143 , @entity123 and @entity144 , creating the potential for a long - term proxy war between regional @entity136 political forces			2
the eventual outcome would have no clear winner but a multitude of losers , most crucially ordinary @entity39 civilians			0
opinion : is @entity4 unsolvable ? still there remains a chance to produce a transition process that ensures the security of all communities -- including the @entity140 -- ending violence in exchange for @entity17 's departure			2
but threatening the regime with decapitation through military escalation will not produce such a process			0
much as the @entity167 regime was removed from power through pressure from @entity171 's principal supporters ( including the @entity2 ) , @entity28 and @entity27 pressure can succeed where force from hostile outsiders has not			1
in @entity171 , this was achieved because the @entity167 regime 's backers managed the transition while assuring their interests were secure			0
without similar assurances there is little reason to expect @entity27 and @entity28 support for a @entity185 transition			2
to facilitate transition , the @entity2 should engage both @entity28 and @entity27 through creative diplomacy			1
@entity28 's cooperation on @entity4 might be linked to the question of its nuclear program , perhaps forestalling sanctions that have yet to come into effect			2
similarly , @entity27 's strategic interests must be addressed , such as preserving the @entity27 navy 's current access to the @entity196 through @entity39 ports			2
if the goal is to end the violence and transition to a post-al - @entity4 , this is the only credible option			0
in resigning as special envoy to @entity4 , @entity201 drew attention to the urgent need for diplomacy , not clandestine intervention			0
unless this warning is heeded , @entity201 's likely replacement , @entity208 , may find no other way out of a lengthy civil war of devastating proportions , both for the @entity39 people and for the @entity214 as a whole			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors .			0

@entity220 and @entity221 : to save @entity4 , bring @entity27 and @entity28 to the international diplomatic table
removing @entity17 will be more costly in the long run than most analysts suppose , they say
to defeat the regime , @entity2 and its allies would have to *heavily* increase destruction , they say
the current international approach seems likely to repeat @entity2 's mistakes in @entity123 , they say
