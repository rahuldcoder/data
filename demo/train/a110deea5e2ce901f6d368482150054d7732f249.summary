a major online security vulnerability dubbed " @entity1 " could put your personal information at risk , including passwords , credit card information and e-mails			1
@entity1 is a flaw in @entity9 , an open - source encryption technology that is used by an estimated two - thirds of web servers			1
it is behind many @entity14 sites that collect personal or financial information			1
these sites are typically indicated by a lock icon in the browser to let site visitors know the information they 're sending online is hidden from prying eyes			1
cybercriminals could exploit the bug to access visitors ' personal data as well as a site 's cryptographic keys , which can be used to impersonate that site and collect even more information			1
it was discovered by a @entity32 researcher and an independent @entity34 security firm called @entity35			2
the researchers have put up a dedicated site to answer common questions about the bug			2
they even gave it an adorably gruesome custom icon			0
@entity1 is the result of a small coding error but it could have far - reaching consequences and affect the majority of internet users			1
researchers discovered the issue last week and published their findings on monday , but said the problem has been present for more than two years , since march 2012			0
any communications that took place over @entity52 in the past two years could have been subject to malicious eavesdropping			0
what makes the bug particularly problematic is that there is no simple fix			0
action needs to be taken by both the compromised sites and individuals who have visited them			0
to protect their user data and encryption keys , sites must upgrade to the patched version of @entity9 , revoke compromised @entity52 certificates and get new ones issued			2
many major websites including @entity32 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 have said they 've taken steps to secure their sites			0
security researchers demonstrated the flaw by stealing @entity70 e-mail logins on tuesday morning , but @entity70 has since fixed the issue across its major sites , including @entity79			2
it 's not just an issue for major sites			2
smaller online stores and services use @entity9 , and those sites might take longer to make the necessary fixes			0
websites do n't typically publicize whether they 're using @entity9 , so the process will also be bumpy for consumers			0
individuals should update their passwords across the various web pages they use , but only once they have confirmed a site has already taken the proper measures to address @entity1			1
if they do n't and that site is still at risk , the new password could also be compromised			0
many sites will also likely send e-mails instructing customers to update passwords if necessary .			1

security research discovers a bug in the encryption technology used by two - thirds of the web
" @entity1 " could put *people* 's personal passwords , e-mails and financial information at risk
addressing the bug will require work by individual sites and the customers who use them
