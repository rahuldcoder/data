@entity0 , @entity1 -- moments after marine explorer @entity4 finished her passionate plea to preserve vast stretches of the world 's oceans at last year 's @entity10 , a foundation executive walked up to her and pledged a million dollars for the cause			1
it was one of nearly 400 offers of support @entity14 received after revealing the wish she wanted to be granted as a winner of the @entity19 , given by the nonprofit organization whose motto is " ideas worth spreading			1
" it grants the winners $ 100,000 and organizational support but the impact of the prize is typically magnified by the backing of the influential audience attending the conferences			0
on wednesday , @entity34 celebrity chef and nutrition advocate @entity32 will reveal his wish as the winner of the 2010 prize			1
" every year we 're looking around for someone who can inspire the world to do something big and interesting , " says @entity38 , who runs @entity10 with the title of curator			1
" the issue of obesity , both in the @entity47 and worldwide , is a big deal , a shocking problem in a world where you 've got a lot of people starving and a lot of people killing themselves by overeating ... or eating the wrong things			2
we were interested in finding an inspirational figure who could address that			0
" past ted prizes have gone to former president @entity61 , rock star and philanthropist @entity62 and biologist @entity63			1
since 2005 , @entity10 has granted wishes to three people a year and continues to work with past winners on achieving their wishes			1
but this year , the only winner will be @entity32 , who has built an empire of cooking shows , cookbooks and restaurants			1
@entity32 , the 34 - year - old son of the owners of a pub / restaurant in @entity76 , @entity77 , came to public attention when he starred in a @entity80 television series , " @entity81			1

the chef branched out into advocacy with a " @entity91 " campaign for improved school lunches in the @entity90 presented a petition with more than 270,000 signatures to the prime minister 's residence at 10 @entity96 in 2005 , and officials promised to spend an added 280 million pounds ( $ 437 million ) to improve school food quality			1
@entity19 winners typically keep their wishes secret until the conference			1
@entity38 told @entity2 last week that he did not know what @entity32 's wish is			1
" the whole idea is that the winner can actually wish for anything			0
we 're taking a bit of a gamble here , for all we know he could wish for a hot tub full of models			0
" the suspense is " part of the magical nature of the prize ... that moment of unveiling is special and it excites people			0
" @entity32 's not tipping his hand about his wish , saying -- through a spokesman -- " i humbly but passionately hope that my wish and my speech will inspire everyone in the room -- and watching on the @entity127 -- to take action on an issue that affects the whole world			1
" @entity10 began in the 1980s as a conference in @entity1 focusing on technology , entertainment and design but has since expanded to include virtually any subject and conferences in other locations			1
speakers , dressed informally , prowl a big stage -- there 's no lectern -- and present their views as a clock ticks away the 18 minutes each is allotted			0
this year 's conference in @entity0 , @entity1 , with 1,500 people attending in person and 500 watching a simulcast at the @entity150 conference in @entity151 , features @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 , among a roster of speakers in fields such as technology , science , philosophy , art , music and design			0
@entity38 , who built and eventually sold a magazine publishing empire in the 1980s and 1990s , first attended a @entity10 conference in 1998 and was intrigued that many people said it was the highlight of their year			1
he acquired @entity10 in 2001 and hosted his first conference in 2003			2
three years later , @entity10 began posting videos of its talks on the @entity174			2
they have been viewed more than 200 million times and many have now been given subtitles in 70 languages , through the work of volunteer translators			0
with the @entity19 , the organization goes beyond simply spreading ideas			1
" whenever i 've been to @entity10 , i 've been struck by how towards the end of the conference , you had a room full of influential connected people absolutely burning with the possibility of inspiration , and it felt like something could be done with that , " @entity38 said			2
after a brainstorming session with participants , the idea of a @entity19 emerged , " a prize that instead of looking back , it looked forward			2
you brought someone to the conference and instead of just honoring them , you granted them a wish , a chance to make a difference in the world , a wish without restrictions			0
" @entity208 , director of the @entity19 , said the year after biologist @entity63 wished for a database to document every species on earth , the organization helped launch the " @entity212			1
" " @entity62 , the humanitarian rock star , won in 2005 , " @entity208 said , " and wished for a million @entity47 to sign up to say that they care about poverty in @entity215			2

in her talk last year , she pointed out that in the past 50 years , 90 percent of the big fish in the oceans have been consumed and nearly half of the ocean 's coral reefs have disappeared			0
less than one percent of the ocean is protected from destructive fishing , and @entity14 believes the seas will go into irreversible decline unless a much larger portion - some experts say as much as 30 percent - is protected			0
@entity14 said the world needs to act swiftly to protect what she calls " the blue heart of the planet that basically keeps us alive			0
" she told @entity2 in an interview that a major public awareness campaign will be launched this year and that plans are underway for a conference at sea to get " influential people to use their talents and intellect to come up with new ways to address these problems			2
" @entity14 attributes these initiatives to the involvement of @entity10			2
" it allows us to tap into individuals and organizations all over the world that i would n't be able to do as an individual , " she said			0
" they create this awareness and they frame the issues in such a way that people get it and they 're inspired to help			0
and that is a true gift			0
