@entity0 -- victims and families of those killed in the @entity5 massacre are asking compensation totaling $ 750 million from the government for failing to stop the attack			1
eighty - three administrative claims were filed last week , saying the @entity10 , the @entity11 , and the @entity13 departments are guilty of gross and willful negligence for not recognizing that the man charged in the shootings , maj. @entity15 , was a threat			1
" although they had clear knowledge and warnings that @entity15 posed a grave danger to the lives and safety of soldiers and civilians with whom he came into contact , they did nothing to eliminate the known risk posed by him , " the " basis of claim " document alleges			2
" on the contrary , bowing to ' political correctness , ' the @entity43 , @entity41 ( @entity41 ) , @entity42 , and @entity11 , in wanton disregard of the safety of military and civilian personnel , intentionally ignored the threat he presented , " says the document , which was attached to each of the 83 claims			1
@entity15 is charged with killing 13 people and wounding dozens more in the killing spree at a medical building at @entity5 , @entity50 , on november 5 , 2009 , where soldiers were screened before deployment to @entity53 and @entity54			1
his court martial , in which prosecutors are seeking the death penalty , is set to begin march 5			1
@entity15 has not entered a plea			2
the lawyer handling the compensation claim , @entity61 , said the next step depends on the government			0
" the @entity10 is taking the lead , " @entity61 told @entity1			2
" they have six months either to deny the claim or satisfactorily resolve it			0
" after that , the case could move into federal court			0
since immediately following the attacks there have been widespread questions about how @entity15 was evaluated , promoted and transferred to @entity5 with plans to deploy to @entity54 despite questions about his ideology and stability			1
a congressional report labeled him " a smoking gun , " and ripped into the government for not sounding an alarm			0
" although neither the @entity43 nor the @entity11 had specific information concerning the time , place , or nature of the attack , they collectively had sufficient information to have detected @entity15 's radicalization to violent @entity95 extremism but failed both to understand and to act on it , " said the report from sens. @entity82 , i - @entity84 , and @entity85 , @entity86			1
" our investigation found specific and systemic failures in the government 's handling of the @entity15 case and raises additional concerns about what may be broader systemic issues , " it said			0
the government refuses to confirm reports that @entity110 intelligence agencies had monitored @entity15 's e-mail contacts with @entity110 - born radical @entity112 , who in september was killed by an @entity110 drone attack in @entity114			1
" it is a tragic irony that our government sought out and killed @entity112 , while @entity15 was promoted in the @entity10 and put in a position to carry out his murderous terror attack , " attorney @entity61 had said in an earlier statement			1
" it is a sad commentary on our avowed war on terror that the government deliberately refused to take even minimal steps to neutralize the clear threat posed by @entity15 , who made no secret of , and actually boasted about , his anti-american and jihadist views			0
" victims and witnesses identified @entity15 as the shooter during a preliminary hearing at @entity5 last year			2
they described the mayhem inside the building , floors slick with blood as the gunman fired more than 150 rounds and methodically reloaded his handgun			0
@entity15 was shot and partially paralyzed in a shootout with police			0
a @entity5 spokesman acknowledged that the compensation claims had been filed			2
" we are aware of the cases but are not able to speak to the specifics , " spokesman @entity144 said in an e-mail			0
" the cases will be taken seriously and will follow due process			0

83 claims have been filed by those wounded and the families of those killed at @entity5
they name the @entity10 , the @entity11 and the @entity13 departments
the @entity10 has six months to act on the claim before it goes to court , an attorney says
