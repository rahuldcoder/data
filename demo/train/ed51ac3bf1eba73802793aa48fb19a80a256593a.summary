@entity0 -- when @entity3 visited the @entity4 this week , shaking hands with president @entity6 and milling around with the rest of the @entity8 , he had no medal to show off			1
and yet , he is undeniably a champion			0
just over five and a half feet tall and less than 130 pounds , he is a running marvel who has shocked the @entity13 community by putting @entity15 marathoners back in contention after many years of also - rans			1
" i kind of fell into it by accident , " @entity3 says with the broad , infectious smile that he carries everywhere			2
" and now look at me			0
" @entity3 's journey to the running record books has been a long , amazing trip			2
when he was just a child growing up in the @entity26 nation of @entity27 , his family went on the run to escape wars at home			1
landing first in @entity32 , they soon made their way to the @entity15 where they found refuge , but @entity3 also found himself a stranger in a strange land			1
he spoke virtually no @entity38 , his family had no money , and he was not a runner			0
he became one the day a gym teacher challenged his class to run a mile as hard as possible			0
@entity3 took off chasing a good grade , and ended up clocking a dazzling 5:20			2
" i just ran as hard as i could to get an a because that 's what my parents expected of me , " he says , laughing at his youthful exuberance			0
through high school and college , he grew more serious about running and much faster , capturing repeated @entity51 championships			0
by 2004 , he was in the @entity13 , winning silver in @entity53 , the first marathon medal for the @entity15 since the legendary @entity55 in the 1970s			1
in 2008 , @entity3 broke his hip while running in the @entity13 trials and failed to make the team , although he still finished eighth			1
the next year he won the @entity59 , the first @entity15 to accomplish that feat in almost 30 years			1
this year he became the oldest marathoner ever to win the @entity15 @entity13 trials , leading the team into @entity64			1
there , he went out to lead early in a hot race , developed side stitches and fell back in the middle miles while the vaunted @entity69 and the @entity71 runner who would eventually grab gold surged ahead			0
@entity3 seemed , as the race announcers had predicted , doomed to a top 20 finish at best			2
but even back in the middle of the pack , he was far from done			0
as the cobblestones ripped at his feet causing excruciating blood blisters , he pushed on			0
the other two @entity15 dropped out with injuries , and @entity3 considered it , too			1
" i did think of dropping out at mile 15 , but i said , ' that 's not my best			0
' i said , ' we are going to represent our country best , and stopping was not our best			0
' " @entity3 started passing more and more runners			2
and shortly after the bronze medalist stepped over the line , unbelievably , here came @entity3 , grinning , waving and streaking in for a fourth - place finish			1
he grabbed an @entity15 flag and held it high for the adoring crowd			2
his feet were so damaged he had to ride a wheelchair through the airport to board his flight home , but he 'd once again proven that he belongs among the greatest marathoners on the planet , something that virtually no other @entity15 runner has been able to say for decades			1
like the title of his book , " run to overcome , " suggests , @entity3 has simply never learned to quit			0
" i always say ' run to win , ' and that 's the best i can do			0
" so while he brought no medal to the @entity4 reception , at an age when many athletes have already retired , he brought something just as valuable : a fourth - place finish in a race that defied @entity15 mastery .			1
