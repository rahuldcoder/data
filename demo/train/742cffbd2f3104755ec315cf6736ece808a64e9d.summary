@entity1 kidnappers are still holding 187 girls captive more than a week after the @entity3 abducted them from their dormitories in northeastern @entity5 , according to school and government officials			1
the figure is much higher than the one earlier released by authorities			1
" a total of 230 parents registered the names of their daughters who were missing on the day of the kidnap , " said @entity10 , principal of the @entity11 in the town of @entity13			1
" from my records , 43 girls have so far escaped on their own from their kidnappers			1
we still have 187 girls missing , " the principal said			1
the school asked parents to come forward and register the names of their missing daughters a day after the april 14 kidnapping			1
@entity32 state government officials insisted only 129 girls were originally abducted from the school , and had said that 51 escaped			1
@entity34 , the spokesman for @entity32 's governor , said the escape of seven more girls on sunday reduced the number of girls in the custody of their @entity1 abductors to 77			1
@entity10 disputed @entity34 's claim of seven more escapes			0
" i 'm not aware of any seven girls that escaped on sunday , " the principal said			2
@entity32 state education commissioner @entity47 confirmed the numbers released by @entity10 and sought to explain the discrepancies in figures provided by the government and the school			2
" there was break in communication which resulted in a lack of coordination , as a result of which different figures were provided , " @entity47 said			0
" but the opening of a register ... provided an avenue where parents of missing children recorded the names of their daughters , which furnished us with a comprehensive list of girls taken away and those that were able to escape , " the commissioner added			1
families becoming impatient in @entity13 , angry parents are becoming impatient , accusing military and state authorities of playing politics with the lives and safety of their children			1
" it is unfortunate that the kidnap of our girls is being politicized , with so many false claims by the military and the government , " said @entity13 resident @entity82			1
" parents and vigilantes have suspended searches for the kidnapped girls since thursday and we are not aware of any military rescue operation going on , " @entity82 said , disputing claims that the military is conducting ongoing rescue operations			1
@entity98 , a father whose daughter and two nieces were among the kidnapped girls , also doubted the military 's claim			1
he and hundreds of other @entity13 residents , as well as people from nearby villages , went into the forest on motorcycles on april 19			2
they followed the tracks of the kidnappers up to @entity112 village , close to the camp where the girls were being held			2
during their nine - hour , 100 - kilometer trek , they never saw a single soldier , @entity98 said			0
villagers told them the gunmen had passed through " and were camped with the girls in a creek some hundreds of meters outside the village			2
" some of the girls had even been brought back to the village at gunpoint to fetch water			2
" we were warned by residents of @entity112 not to proceed , saying they feared for our lives because our sticks and ( outdated ) guns were no match for the heavy arms of the @entity1 gunmen , " he explained			2
" the villagers warned us we would all be killed if we dared face the gunmen and would put the lives of our daughters in danger			0
we have therefore abandoned the search for our daughters since we know where they are but we do n't have the capacity to liberate them , " @entity98 added			0
some managed to escape the father of a girl who escaped with two other girls from their abductors on april 16 also said they had been held at gunpoint			1
" she told us that all the girls were gathered under trees in the forest under constant watch of gunmen , " said the father , who asked not to be named for security reasons			0
" my daughter was among those selected by the kidnappers to cook food and she and two other girls cooking together came up with a plan			0
they told their kidnappers they needed to use the bathroom , " said the father			0
the girls ran off once they were out of view of their armed guards until they came across a village , where residents helped them get back to @entity13			0
@entity172 , a @entity13 resident , wondered why the government failed to act on information supplied by residents about the location of the @entity1 camp near @entity112 village			0
but @entity47 said the government and the military were " doing everything possible " to secure the release of the schoolgirls			0
" this is a delicate situation that requires careful handling , " @entity47 said			0
" when you have heavily armed men holding close to 200 girls hostage , you have to be very careful in your approach so as not to risk the safety of these girls you want to rescue			0
" it is a security issue and we just ca n't be divulging all the efforts we are making to get these girls freed , " the education commissioner explained .			0
