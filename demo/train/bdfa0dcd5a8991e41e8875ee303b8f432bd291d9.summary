in what 's sure to be a moment fraught with symbolism and broadcast around the world , an infantry company - sized contingent of @entity2 will cross over wednesday into @entity7 , @entity8 , from @entity9			1
they 'll bring heavy weapons , artillery and gear crucial to the ongoing @entity15 defense of @entity7 , now in its sixth week			1
but , despite all the attention it will garner , the troop movement does n't necessarily signal a major shift in the fight , analysts say			0
" in terms of a major war that 's of some significance to @entity31 national security , the arrival of 150 militiamen to an area is probably not of tectonic significance , " said @entity22 , a senior fellow with the @entity23			2
that 's particularly , @entity35 defense fellow @entity34 says , since most tacticians consider @entity7 to be of little inherent strategic interest in the fight against @entity39 , which has captured large areas in @entity8 and @entity41			1
what could be significant , @entity22 says , is the back story explaining how @entity9 leaders came to allow the movement in the first place			0
the @entity31 wants @entity9 to do more , including committing ground troops to the fight , @entity22 said			0
it could signal a backroom deal unlocking greater @entity9 cooperation in the fight against @entity39 , the militant group that calls itself the " @entity52			1
" or , @entity22 says , it could simply be the product of a @entity9 government holding its nose in an effort to deal with an increasingly rotten crisis on its doorstep			0
@entity31 's newest allies : @entity8 's @entity60 the @entity2 force the @entity65 contingent arrived by air from @entity67 , @entity41 , and landed in @entity68 , @entity9 , early wednesday , @entity9 's @entity63 news agency reported			1
the group was driven in six minibuses toward the border , @entity63 reported , while a separate convoy crossed into @entity9 carrying weapons for the @entity74			1
the fighters will enter @entity7 soon to reinforce fellow @entity60 who are defending against @entity39 , a @entity2 general told @entity6 on tuesday			1
" the @entity2 have been ready for a few days , then had logistical problems , but they no longer do , " brig			0
gen. @entity79 said of the @entity74 @entity15 forces			1
the force is made up of 161 @entity2 fighters with weapons " that will be of good help to our brothers in @entity7 , " according to an official with the @entity89 , the defense ministry for the semiautonomous @entity90 in northern @entity41			1
separately , about 200 @entity8 rebels entered @entity7 at dawn wednesday with weapons that included mortars and heavy machine guns , @entity8 rebel commander col. @entity91 told @entity6 by phone			1
more fighters are available if needed , he said			0
what impact will they have ? the @entity2 fighters are better trained and equipped than their @entity8 @entity15 counterparts , and are bringing heavy weapons sorely lacking in @entity7 , @entity34 said			1
they will roll into a city defended by a beleaguered band of @entity105 and @entity107 fighters who have seen few reinforcements since @entity39 ' siege of the city began in mid-september			0
and their arrival probably cements the city 's defenses against @entity39 , @entity34 said			2
still , @entity39 is also reinforcing its contingent in @entity7 , @entity34 said , setting out the prospect of a protracted fight over the city that has become important less for its strategic value than its role as a television star			2
@entity7 lies just across the border from @entity9 , giving international journalists a clear vantage point to report on the battle there			2
but there is a military significance as well , analysts say			0
with all the attention on the fight and both sides bringing in reinforcements , @entity34 said , the fight for @entity7 continues to give @entity31 and allied forces the opportunity to bloody @entity39 there , and to keep its forces tied up			2
" as long as the city does n't fall , it works to the advantage of the @entity31 strategy , " he said			0
" the @entity39 guys who are fighting in the city are n't available to fight somewhere else			0
" the @entity9 role @entity9 officials were not immediately available to comment on wednesday 's @entity2 movements			0
but @entity9 has previously said it would allow the @entity2 to pass through its territory into @entity8			2
with @entity39 controlling the @entity8 land surrounding @entity7 , the @entity2 's easiest path into @entity7 is through @entity9			1
@entity9 's decision to let the @entity2 traverse @entity9 territory represented a major policy shift			2
the @entity8 @entity15 fighters , part of the @entity152 , or @entity152 , have ties to the @entity154 , or @entity154 , which has fought a 30 - year guerrilla war against the government of @entity9 , where about 20 % of the population is @entity15			1
@entity9 , the @entity158 and @entity31 consider the @entity154 a terrorist organization			0
earlier this month , @entity9 president @entity160 said the @entity8 @entity15 and @entity39 militants were " terrorists			1
" the @entity9 government also has bristled at the @entity31 ' efforts to parachute weapons , ammunition and medicine to @entity152 fighters			0
but while @entity9 did nothing to intervene in @entity7 , @entity60 protested in @entity9 streets			2
more than 30 people were killed in cities around @entity9 this month as ethnic @entity60 clashed with @entity173 and nationalist groups as well as @entity9 police			0
@entity6 's @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 contributed to this report .			0

@entity184 's arrival will be symbolic , but not a major *development* , analyst says
official : @entity74 @entity15 fighters heading to @entity8 @entity15 town of @entity7
@entity9 has said it would allow the fighters to enter @entity7 through @entity9
@entity7 has been under @entity39 attack since september
