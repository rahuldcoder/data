-- @entity1 now has two pieces of metal to wear -- one , a bracelet inscribed with the names of his six comrades killed in an ambush in @entity8 , the other , a @entity9 given to him for his valor that ensured that death toll was n't higher			1
speaking minutes after president @entity13 gave him the highest military honor , @entity1 insisted the two emblems are equally significant			1
they both represent his family on that day six years ago -- the seven others who , like him , survived as well as those who did not			0
the former @entity20 sergeant said tuesday he owes it to these men , whom he calls " my heroes , " to live his life well , even now that he 's left the military , and with honor			1
" though i am still uncomfortable with hearing my name and the word ' hero ' in the same sentence , i am now ready for the challenge of proudly wearing this piece of blue fabric and carved metal with the same reverence that i wear the bracelet			0
and i vow to live up to the responsibility of doing so , " @entity1 said			1
not long before , @entity13 recalled @entity1 's bravery and that of his colleagues			1
the president paid tribute to those who died that fall day in @entity8 and those who survived			1
they had done everything their country could ask for and more			0
" @entity1 , members of @entity52 , you did your duty , " @entity13 said			1
" and now it 's time for @entity55 to do ours			0
" @entity1 himself insisted that the @entity9 can not really be an individual award , calling it " a testament to the trust we have in each other and our leaders			1
" still , the president said that he deserved to be singled out			0
a high school freshman when the @entity66 fell on september 11 , 2001 , @entity1 joined the @entity20 and was just 20 years old and 21 months into his military service when he faced the ultimate test			1
he aced it , and in doing so represented the best of what @entity13 called the " 9/11 generation ( which ) has proven itself to be one of @entity55 's greatest			1
" " today , " the president said to a crowd that included @entity1 , his parents and many of his former comrades , " we pay tribute to a soldier who embodies the courage of his generation			1
" attacked in ' ambush alley ' on tuesday , @entity1 dressed in full uniform			1
but on most other weekdays , he now wears a suit to his job as an investment analyst at a bank in @entity90 , @entity91 -- a job that he 's admitted to @entity13 , with a laugh , is less exciting than his previous job in the @entity20			1
the @entity96 native joined up after high school , following the lead of his father , a former @entity100 member			0
his service had , like many other members of the military , earned him a ticket to @entity8 as his platoon 's radio telephone operator			1
he was there on november 9 , 2007 , walking back from a meeting with elders with his unit of 14 and a squad of @entity8 army soldiers			1
" they knew not to stop , they had to keep moving , " @entity13 recalled of the group walking single - file with a cliff to their right and a steep , rocky slope to their left			1
" they were heading into an area known as ambush alley			0
" in an interview prior to the award ceremony , @entity1 told @entity0 how the group walked " down this little incline and looking into the valley , ( when ) i hear this single shot			1
then two shots , then the echo , then fully automatic gunfire			0
" taking so much fire , members of his patrol were separated as they tried to take cover			2
@entity1 was finishing off his first magazine and beginning to load another one when an rocket - propelled grenade exploded , knocking him unconscious			1
moments after he came to , an enemy round hit a rock just inches from his head			0
the shrapnel and rock fragments cut his face			0
dazed , he struggled to take in what was happening			0
he and four others had been separated from the other soldiers , who 'd jumped from a cliff			0
@entity1 administered first aid to one wounded soldier using the only cover available : a single tree			1
it was at that point in the attack that @entity1 realized his radio was n't working			2
he looked out and saw a member of his patrol about 30 feet away whose wounds were so bad that he could not move			0
@entity1 ran toward him , braving enemy fire			1
@entity1 was able to drag the wounded man back to the tree			1
but the man 's injuries were too severe , and he died			0
risking death , again and again @entity1 continued to risk himself to help his fellow warriors , again running from cover into enemy fire to reach the platoon leader			1
@entity1 told the military publication @entity174 that he could see the leader 's helmet and assault pack , but he could n't tell whether the leader was alive			1
@entity1 had to see , he said			2
@entity1 crawled toward the man			2
@entity1 figured he would be killed			2
but he would do what he was trained to do			0
he would carry out his duty			0
" it was never a choice , " he explained to @entity0			0
" i told myself from the beginning that i was going to be killed , you know ... just the amount of fire ... i 'm not gon na make it through this			0
" but he kept focused			0
the soldier @entity1 had dragged to the tree earlier was hit again , this time in the knee , so the @entity1 wrapped his belt around the man 's leg , creating a tourniquet			1
then @entity1 found a working radio on a deceased comrade and called for artillery and helicopter gunships to help			2
finally , maybe , there could be hope			0
but then a friendly mortar round landed near @entity1			2
" i remember just red hot chunks of metal like the size of my palm just flinging by your head , " he told @entity174			0
suffering a concussion , @entity1 managed to hang on , waiting for helicopters to evacuate him and others with him that day			2
when help arrived , he told his rescuers to put the other wounded aboard first			0
a soldier , changed speaking with @entity219 this week , @entity1 said the experience -- from the violence to the wait -- seemed like " forever			1
" and it has n't entirely gone away , all these years later			0
" it 's something you still think about every day , " @entity1 said			2
" i still have these images from that day burned into my head			0
but it 's something , as time goes on , it gets easier			0
" but something inside him changed , he said			0
" even to this day , you know , i ca n't say if it was something good or bad			0
... " he told @entity219			0
" and that was pretty much the reason why i decided to leave the @entity20			2
" @entity1 first returned home and trained other paratrooopers			2
when it came time for @entity1 to re-enlist , he thought hard about whether doing so felt right			2
he decided against it because he doubted that he could devote his complete heart and mind to it , he told @entity219			0
it was unacceptable to him to continue in the service and then , perhaps , be deployed to @entity8			2
service members deserve a leader who is all in , he explained			0
@entity13 called him on february 10 to tell him he 'd be given the @entity9			1
he 's the 10th recipient of that award for his actions in @entity8 , and the seventh surviving recipient			1
four service members received the @entity9 -- all posthumously -- for actions in the war in @entity253 , according to the @entity254			2
in a brief statement to reporters after tuesday 's ceremony , @entity1 called the @entity9 " a symbol of the responsibility all soldiers knowingly face when they depart for distant lands in defense of the nation , a responsibility that locks us all in the bonds of brotherhood			1
" as such , @entity1 could n't help but think about his brothers in arms			2
" without the team , " he said , " there could be no @entity9			1
that is why i wear this medal for my team			0
