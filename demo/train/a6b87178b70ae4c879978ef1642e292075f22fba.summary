i could n't quite believe my eyes when i read the initial comments from @entity5 's ceo on how women who do n't ask for raises will receive " good karma			1
" what ? is this 2014 or 1954 ? the ceo , @entity4 , has since tried to clarify his comments , which were ironically made at a conference in @entity12 celebrating women in computing			1
@entity4 took to @entity15 to say he was " inarticulate " on the topic of how women should ask for a raise			1
at the conference , he appeared to be saying that women who have faith that things will work out ( and who do n't speak up ) will see pay increases in the long term during their careers			1
in his @entity15 mea culpa , there was no talk of faith or karma			1
@entity4 said the tech industry needs to close the gender pay gap " so a raise is not needed because of a bias			1
" there are so many reasons why @entity4 's initial comments are so worrisome			1
i 've tried to boil down my anger and the outrage of other women on social media to five : 1			2
other men think this way : first , it 's clear that @entity4 believes that women should trust that things will work out in the long run , or he would never have said it			1
the question is how many other male chief executives feel the same way			0
i 'm guessing there are some			0
and if they do feel this way , how motivated are they to close the gender pay gap ? do they feel like @entity4 implied that income differences will work out in the end ? women make 78 cents for every dollar our male colleagues make			1
for several years , the number has been 77 cents to every dollar a man earns			1
i 'm not sure " karma " is going to bring that gap to zero			2
women are already afraid to ask : i remember a story i worked on while i was at the women 's website @entity74			2
we asked women how often they asked for a raise , and their responses were shocking			2
only 35 % of the 1,500 women surveyed said they ever asked for a raise			2
fewer than one in five said they ever asked for a promotion , according to the survey			0
most women are already reluctant to speak up when it comes to getting more money for their work			0
comments like the ones from the @entity5 ceo are n't likely to increase their confidence to go for it			1
@entity92 gives feminism new life 3			0
we need more female chief executives : i 'm not really into betting , but this is a wager i feel very confident i 'd win			0
would a female chief executive officer have ever suggested that women should trust the system and trust that they 'll receive " good karma " if they do n't ask for raises ? absolutely not			1
i do n't think any woman , especially one who has gone on to head a @entity106 company , would say she ever trusted the system to get where she is			0
she most likely had to take on the system and speak up for herself over and over again throughout her career			0
so @entity4 's big - time gender gaffe points to why we need more women in the c - suite			1
sadly , as we reported last year , there has been no significant difference in the number of women in executive positions for four years in a row			0
we need more women in tech : we already knew we have too few women in the tech industry , but the @entity5 chief 's gaffe is another reminder			1
you have to wonder if he 'd ever make such comments or believe them if he were surrounded by more women			2
according to @entity133 , @entity5 's work force is 71 % male , but the male - female breakdown gets even worse when you focus on technical and leadership roles			2
eighty - three percent of those positions are male , according to @entity133 , which reports that the figures are roughly in line with the male - female breakdown at @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			0
the issue is not just one of diversity but what impacts the bottom line			0
the research shows that there is a positive correlation between diversity on boards and in the c - suite and a company 's financial performance			0
what message are we sending our girls ? : there 's been so much discussion in the past year or two about how we need to get our girls to lean in , how we need to ban the the word " bossy , " how we need to have them stop apologizing and feel good and confident about who they are			0
and then we have a chief executive officer of one of the country 's top tech companies sending a message that could easily be translated into encouraging our girls to be good and not ruffle anyone 's feathers , and that that 's how they 'll get what they want			0
we women know that 's not how the world works			0
girl 's letter to sports retailer calls out gender imbalance in catalog so i 'm thinking we might need to create a new campaign , taking a page from the fabulously successful " @entity181 " ad by @entity189 , which called attention to how the term " run like a girl " became a negative when it should be a source of strength			0
how about a campaign titled " make a @entity197 " ? there are way too many men who could be included , but we 'd give the starring role to the @entity5 chief at the moment			2
what do you think about the @entity5 ceo 's initial comments that women should n't ask for a raise ? tell @entity209 on @entity15 or @entity210 on @entity142 .			1
