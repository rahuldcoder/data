@entity0 hosts @entity1 and @entity2 have told @entity3 a documentary accusing football fans from both nations of racism was " unbalanced and biased			1
" an investigation by @entity11 television channel the @entity8 featured right - wing supporters from both countries displaying racist and anti-semitic attitudes			1
footage also appeared to show soccer fans at a match in @entity1 targeting @entity19 supporters with violence			2
former @entity22 defender @entity21 warned fans not to travel to @entity2 or @entity1 after seeing the pictures and questioned why both countries were awarded the tournament in the first place			1
are @entity2 and @entity1 ready to host festival of football ? but speaking to @entity3 , representatives from the governments of @entity1 and @entity2 said the show was misleading			1
" what was aired , in my personal opinion , is unbalanced and biased reporting about the situation in @entity1 , " @entity33 , @entity1 's ambassador to the @entity11 , said			1
" i would like to say we do not in @entity1 have a problem of that magnitude as it appeared on the screen			2
" racism and racial ideology is against the law and if those young fans were shouting anything close to @entity48 slogans they would have been prosecuted			0
@entity49 , rather than @entity50 and @entity51 , dominates @entity0 storylines " @entity1 is very well known for its tolerance and it has a long history of living together with other nationalities			1
in our national football championship , roughly half of all the players are from @entity19 , @entity61 and @entity62 countries			0
" the @entity64 episode broadcast footage filmed at matches in both @entity2 and @entity1 that purported to show fans displaying @entity48 salutes in the stands and aiming monkey chants at black players			1
family members of two players in the @entity22 squad -- @entity74 pair @entity73 and @entity75 -- have already said they wo n't be going to the tournament due to fears over racism			0
but @entity79 , @entity80 spokesman , told @entity3 the program was " cheap journalism			0
" he said : " there is a problem with racism and anti-semitism in @entity2 but it is blown out of every possible proportion in this material			1
@entity90 pm : suspend @entity90 soccer leagues " they interviewed many people with balanced opinions and they complained today that their voices were not used in this program			0
" do you know how many @entity11 tourists come to @entity2 evry year ? 500,000			1
and do you know how many reports they gave to the @entity102 and consulates about racism in the last three years ? zero			0
" we are hospitable and treat all people who come here as friends			0
" @entity109 claim taking high - profile tournaments to different places in @entity112 helps to tackle any problems regarding discrimination in the host country			0
in a statement , soccer 's @entity112 governing body said : " @entity0 brings the spotlight on the host countries and clearly creates an opportunity to address and confront such societal issues			2
" @entity109 's ' zero tolerance ' approach to racism is still valid both on and off the pitch and ultimately the referee has the power to stop or abandon a match should racist incidents occur			0
" @entity131 , executive director of the @entity133 organization , said there was still plenty of work to be done in both @entity2 and @entity1			2
" i think we know the situation in domestic football in both @entity2 and @entity1 and i 'm afraid the documentary hit the nail on the head -- it 's a very bad situation , " he said			1
" nevertheless there is some good work going at grass roots level to make sure that @entity0 inside stadiums does not resemble the sort of scenes we saw in the documentary			2
" @entity152 said that although the @entity8 's documentary had provoked a strong reaction in the @entity11 , other countries involved in @entity0 would be concerned that @entity109 do all they can to ensure a safe tournament			1
" there will be mixed teams in the @entity159 , @entity160 , the @entity161 have a lot of black players , " he added			0
" i think all of those teams will be looking at themselves and saying what sort of safety precautions do we need to take ? do our relatives travel or do they stay behind and how do we respond to possible outbreaks of racism ? " we have a procedure with @entity109 to deal with these sort of issues and we 're fairly clear that it 's a good procedure			0
" it will work in the right way and i think we 'll see a lot of teams and their fans probably getting sanctioned quite heavily by @entity109 by the end of the tournament			0
