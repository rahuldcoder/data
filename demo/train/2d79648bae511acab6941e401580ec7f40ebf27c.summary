the @entity1 @entity0 will rule thursday on the constitutionality of the sweeping health care law championed by president @entity4 , in a hotly awaited decision that is bound to divide the country			1
the stakes can not be overstated : what the justices decide will have an immediate and long - term impact on all @entity1 , both in how they get medicine and health care , and also in vast , yet unknown areas of " commerce			1
" five scenarios : health care options before the justices according to a poll released tuesday , 37 % of @entity1 say they would be pleased if the health care law is deemed unconstitutional by the @entity0			1
twenty - eight percent would be pleased if the @entity23 is ruled constitutional , the @entity22 / @entity21 survey showed , compared to 35 % who said they would be disappointed if the court came back with that outcome			2
but nearly four in 10 @entity1 surveyed said they would have " mixed feelings " if the justices struck down the whole law			0
the survey of 1,000 adults was conducted june 20 - 24			0
the real people behind health care reform previous surveys have indicated that some who oppose the law do so because they think it does n't go far enough			1
the polarizing law , dubbed " @entity23 " by many , is the signature legislation of @entity4 's time in office			2
@entity44 , the presumptive @entity45 presidential nominee , told supporters in @entity47 on tuesday : " if @entity23 is not deemed constitutional , then the first three and a half years of this president 's term will have been wasted on something that has not helped the @entity1 people			2
" @entity44 , whose opposition to the law has been a rallying cry on the stump , continued : " if it is deemed to stand , then i 'll tell you one thing			0
then we 'll have to have a president -- and i 'm that one -- that 's gon na get rid of @entity23			0
we 're gon na stop it on day one			0
" speaking to supporters in @entity65 tuesday , @entity4 defended his health care law as the way forward for the @entity1 people			1
opinion : aging boomers need health care law " they understand we do n't need to re-fight this battle over health care , " he said			1
" it 's the right thing to do that we 've got 3 million young people who are on their parent 's health insurance plans that did n't have it before			1
it 's the right thing to do to give seniors discounts on their prescription drugs			0
it 's the right thing to do to give 30 million @entity1 health insurance that did n't have it before			2
" @entity90 spokesman @entity89 told reporters tuesday that the administration is " confident that the @entity23 is constitutional , in keeping with decades of precedent under the @entity94			0
we continue to implement the law accordingly , and we are ready for the @entity0 's decision , whatever it may be			2
" in its ruling thursday , the nation 's highest court could rule the whole law constitutional or unconstitutional , or strike down certain portions of the law while letting other provisions stand			0
the @entity0 heard three days of politically charged hearings in march on the @entity23 , a landmark but controversial measure passed by congressional @entity108 despite pitched @entity45 opposition			1
the challenge focused primarily on the law 's requirement that most @entity1 buy health insurance or pay a fine			1
supporters of the plan argued the " individual mandate " is necessary for the system to work , while critics argued it is an unconstitutional intrusion on individual freedom			0
all sides preparing for political fallout from health care decision four different federal appeals courts heard challenges to parts of the law before the @entity0 ruling , and came up with three different results			1
courts in @entity133 and @entity134 voted to uphold the law , while the appeals court in @entity65 struck down the individual mandate			0
a fourth panel , in @entity139 , @entity47 , put its decision off until penalties for failing to buy health insurance take effect in 2014			1
the @entity23 passed @entity143 along strictly partisan lines in march 2010 , after a lengthy and heated debate marked by intense opposition from the health insurance industry and conservative groups			1
when @entity4 signed the legislation later that month , he called it historic and said it marked a " new season in @entity1			0
" while it was not the comprehensive national health care system liberals initially sought , supporters said the law would reduce health care costs , expand coverage and protect consumers			1
health care 's big four issues : what the justices are tackling the law establishes a staged series of reforms over several years , including banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions , forbidding insurers from setting a dollar limit on health coverage payouts , and requiring them to cover preventative care at no additional cost to consumers			1
it also required individuals to have health insurance , either through their employers or a state - sponsored exchange , or face a fine beginning in 2014			1
supporters argue the individual mandate is critical to the success of the legislation , because it expands the pool of people paying for insurance and ensures that healthy people do not opt out of buying insurance until they needed it			0
critics say the provision gives the government too much power over what they say should be a personal economic decision			0
twenty - six states , led by @entity200 , say individuals can not be forced to buy insurance , a " product " they may neither want nor need			2
and they argue that if that provision is unconstitutional , the entire law must go			0
the @entity207 countered that since every @entity1 will need medical care at some point in their lives , individuals do not " choose " whether to participate in the health care market			1
@entity143 ready for high court 's health care decisions -- then it gets tricky the partisan debate around such a sweeping piece of legislation has encompassed almost every traditional hot - button topic : abortion and contraception funding , state and individual rights , federal deficits , end - of - life care , and the overall economy			1
during arguments on march 27 , justice @entity228 said the law appeared to " change the relationship between the government and the individual in a profound way			0
" chief justice @entity235 argued that " all bets are off " when it comes to federal government authority if @entity143 was found to have the authority to regulate health care in the name of commerce			2
liberal justices , however , argued people who do n't pay into the health system by purchasing insurance make care more expensive for everyone			2
timeline of the health care law " it is not your free choice " to stay out of the market for life , justice @entity250 said during arguments			1
" i think the justices probably came into the argument with their minds made up			0
they had hundreds of briefs and months to study them , " said @entity260 , publisher of @entity261 and a prominent @entity134 attorney , though he conceded that " the oral arguments ( in march ) might have changed their minds around the margin			0
" the law , which helped spur the creation of the conservative tea party movement , is likely to be a centerpiece of the presidential election campaign			0
the legislation signed by @entity4 reached 2,700 pages , nine major sections and some 450 provisions			0
the first lawsuits challenging the health care overhaul began just hours after the president signed the measure			2
