@entity0 -- @entity2 is all set to give out its own first - ever peace prize thursday , a move apparently to counter the @entity6 's choice of imprisoned @entity2 dissident @entity7 as this year 's laureate			1
organizers told @entity1 they will present the @entity10 -- which comes with an award of $ 15,000 -- in @entity0 to promote the ancient sage 's philosophy , a day before the @entity14 in @entity15			1
" @entity2 is a great nation that has been influenced by the @entity19 concept of peace for a long time , " said @entity16 , chairman of the awards committee			2
" we want to promote world peace from an @entity25 perspective			0
" " @entity27 is full of small countries that had fought each other for centuries , " he added			0
" we do n't want to see people who do n't understand peace to ruin the concept			0
" @entity16 declined to give details about his group -- other than saying it is a non-government organization -- or how the five - judge awards committee operated			2
his committee has released a vaguely worded statement on its criteria for choosing the winner , but announced this year 's nominees included @entity43 , @entity44 and the @entity45 , a @entity46 leader loyal to @entity0			1
@entity2 has responded furiously since the @entity48 committee announced its decision on october 8			1
officials have repeatedly called @entity14 -- currently serving an 11 - year sentence for " inciting subversion " -- a common criminal and the award a @entity56 plot against @entity2			1
a businessman first proposed a rival peace prize in a commentary on the november 17 edition of @entity61 , an @entity62 newspaper published by the @entity64 mouthpiece @entity65			0
echoing government spokesmen , @entity66 said that by awarding the prize to a criminal , the @entity48 committee created 1.3 billion " dissidents " in @entity2			2
" we often stress the need to fight for the right to speak , " he wrote			0
" @entity2 's civil society should consider setting up a ' @entity10 ' ... to declare @entity2 's view on peace and human rights to the world			1
" @entity2 has warned other countries of " consequences " if they attend friday 's @entity48 ceremony in @entity15			2
a foreign ministry spokeswoman said tuesday that more than 100 countries and groups had joined @entity2 in boycotting this year 's event			1
the @entity48 committee , which said it had sent out 65 invitations to embassies in @entity15 , counted 19 countries that had declined so far -- including @entity2 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			0
@entity16 , the awards committee chairman for the @entity10 , would not divulge the guest list for his event			0
he confirmed the first honoree is @entity100 , @entity101 's former vice president , for his contribution in bridging the gap between the island and mainland @entity2			2
@entity100 's staff said they were surprised to hear the news			0
" we know who @entity112 is , but do n't know anything about this prize , " said @entity108 , director of @entity100 's office in @entity110			0
despite the perceived rivalry between the two peace prizes , they may have one important thing in common -- the absence of their recipients at this year 's award ceremonies .			1
