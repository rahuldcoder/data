-- let 's play a little game			1
which of the following signs did protestors hold at the march on @entity6 , 50 years ago this week , and which were held up this year by fast - food workers : 1			1
" @entity10 minimum wages coverage for all workers now ! " 2			1
" we are worth more " 3			0
" we march for jobs for all a decent pay now ! " the exclamation points , which apparently were more popular in the 1960s ( despite what @entity17 would have you believe ! ! ! ) , are your best clue			0
signs one and four are from 1963			0
two and three are from 2013			0
fifty years later , it 's easy to forget that the full name of the 1963 " @entity24 " was actually " @entity24			1
" @entity25 : 99 must - reads on economic inequality but flip through some pictures from that rally , where @entity29 gave his famous " @entity37 " speech and where civil rights leaders , to borrow his words , bent the arc of history towards justice and greater equality , and you 'll see protest signs that put the economy as a front - and - center issue , just as it is now			1
" president @entity46 , in commemorating the 50th anniversary of that march this week , smartly picked up on the theme that economic equality is " the great unfinished business " of @entity29 's vision for a just and fair @entity51			1
" ... [ a ] s we mark this anniversary , we must remind ourselves that the measure of progress for those who marched 50 years ago was not merely how many blacks had joined the ranks of millionaires ; it was whether this country would admit all people who were willing to work hard , regardless of race , into the ranks of a middle - class life , " @entity46 said wednesday			1
" the test was not and never has been whether the doors of opportunity are cracked a bit wider for a few			0
it was whether our economic system provides a fair shot for the many , for the black custodian and the white steelworker , the immigrant dishwasher and the @entity77 veteran			2
" the subtext of his argument : class may be the new race			2
it 's not that all battles for racial equality have been won -- they have n't -- or that we live in a post-racial society			2
but , in some remarkable and troubling ways , class has become an increasingly significant barrier to equality in modern @entity51			2
the gap between rich and poor has been growing in the @entity51 since the late 1970s , and our level of income inequality , one proxy measure for that gap , is now on par with many @entity100 countries			0
@entity25 : who cares about the economy ? ... you ! it 's become more difficult for the poor to move up into the middle class and more difficult for the middle to dig in its heels to stop from slipping into poverty			1
the @entity51 mantra of " work hard and you 'll get ahead " is not always enough to sustain people			0
it 's harder now to secure a financial future			2
this is the theme that underlies much of what 's happening in @entity51 today			2
and it 's something that goes back much farther than the recent recession			2
the fast - food workers , for example , who scheduled demonstrations across the country on thursday , are frustrated by the fact that they ca n't make ends meet on $ 7.25 per hour			1
if you doubt whether that 's true , please take a look at one fast - food worker 's budget			1
some workers , as @entity135 reports , have to choose between paying for rent or food			1
" should i pay my light bill ( or ) should i pay my gas ? " one fast - food worker asks in this @entity140 video			1
" i never can pay it all at once			0
" " right now the gas is off , " she says			0
the workers demand a living wage of $ 15 per hour			2
i 'm not sure what the fair wage would be			0
that 's the subject for another column ... or perhaps a book			2
but i do know that , as the @entity157 reports , fast - food workers in @entity155 make $ 14.50 an hour , about twice the @entity51 minimum wage			1
and burgers have n't become too expensive @entity160			0
some context is helpful for understanding that movement as well			0
the @entity51 minimum wage is actually lower than it was in the late 1960s			0
five years after @entity29 's speech in front of the @entity166 , the federal minimum wage , when converted into 2013 dollars , was $ 10.70 , compared to $ 7.25 now			1
( the nominal minimum wage , according to the @entity168 , was only $ 1.60 per hour in 1968			0
the $ 10.70 amount is adjusted for inflation )			0
@entity25 : @entity172 should pay its interns education is another example			1
there 's evidence poverty is a better indicator of educational achievement than race			2
" according to a 2011 research study by @entity185 sociologist @entity184 , the test - score gap between the children of the poor ( in the 10th percentile of income ) and the children of the wealthy ( in the 90th percentile ) has expanded by as much as 40 % and is now more than 50 % larger than the black - white achievement gap -- a reversal of the trend 50 years ago , " @entity182 writes for the @entity157			1
" underprivileged children now languish at achievement levels that are close to four years behind their wealthy peers			0
" four years behind their peers			0
just because of their income			0
that challenges the very notion of who we are as @entity51			0
we see ourselves as a middle - class country -- a place where anyone can work hard and succeed			1
we 're a country of fighters			0
but it 's become more difficult for the non-rich to make it			0
the country has made great strides toward racial equality since the @entity24			1
but , in the 50 years since @entity29 's speech , economic justice seems to have become the more distant dream			1
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity25 .			1

fast - food workers scheduled protests across the country this week
@entity226 : class seems to be the social justice issue of our time
it 's been 50 years since the " @entity24 "
economic justice remains a distant dream for many , @entity25 says
