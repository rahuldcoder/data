@entity1 , @entity0 -- when you are next in the lobby of a @entity6 hotel in @entity7 , take a deep breath			1
it may not hit you at first , but if you 're careful you should detect a hint of geranium or a note of freesia			0
branded scents of flowers are becoming a common feature in hotel lobbies the fragrance is part of the hotel chain 's attempt to elevate the senses , transform the space and , above all , create a memorable experience for its guest			1
@entity6 are not alone in this approach			1
other business travel environments including business class lounges and planes are filling their air with branded scents as companies cash in on the power of smell as a marketing tool			1
the idea is that the sense of smell is closely linked to the part of the brain that controls both emotion and memory			1
in fact , three quarters of our day - to - day emotions are thought to be influenced by what we smell			1
brands for decades have created logos , and relied on their repeated use to build a visual association , and with that brand loyalty and engagement			1
but as @entity55 , executive director of @entity56 ( that is spearheading the concept of sensory branding ) says , vision goes to the part of the brain that controls rational thought			2
" this means we tend to override the signals , " he says			0
" but because smell goes to the part of the brain linked to emotion , it creates a more direct and powerful response			1
if we can create associations with a fragrance , then it becomes a very powerful way to enhance the brand			1
" using smell as a branding technique is not new			1
since the 1990s , @entity76 has been using its own fragrance , known as @entity78			2
flight attendants wear it as perfume , it is blended into the hot towels served before take - off and it wafts through the cabin during the flight			0
as outlined in the book @entity85 my @entity87 , also @entity88 , you may not necessarily remember the smell , but as soon as you step into the aircraft it has the " potential to kick - start a kaleidoscope of smooth , comfortable memories , all reflecting the more obvious customer service and quality efforts of the @entity76 brand			1
" @entity55 also founded @entity99 that specializes in providing aromatic solutions in marketing			0
seven or eight years ago he worked with @entity102 to develop a fragrance for seven the airline 's business class lounges			2
the idea was to bring " the outdoors in " , says @entity55 , through the use of smell of running water			2
unfortunately , this work coincided with @entity113 's tail re-branding exercise and the smell was literally drowned out			2
other smells have lingered , however			2
retailers and food service companies are increasingly using it as a technique and @entity120 has pumping smells into its @entity122 and 125 @entity6 for over 18 months			1
@entity123 , @entity124 spokesperson for @entity120 says the scent in the @entity6 hotels has proved a hit with guests			1
as a result , they have now created their own line of candles and potpourris so guests can take the smell home with them			2
" hundreds of guests asked how to purchase the scent for their home prompting a waiting list for the exclusive collection months before its debut , " she says			0
but for those who might have thought existing advertising techniques were sinister enough , this new multi-sensory approach may really get up your nose			0
others have been concerned about the overuse of chemicals and the risk of exacerbating allergies			0
( @entity120 says its smells are natural and hypoallergenic )			1
other critics say smells are simply obtrusive			0
but @entity55 is not deterred			0
this is not about bombarding people with a smell , he says			0
" we are talking one or two parts of fragrance per billion molecules of air			0
humans can detect tiny amount of air , so it should be done very subtly			0
" and after all , he adds , when you go into a business lounge it 's going to smell of something			0
so rather than the whiff of a take - away burger or a sweaty traveller create the emotional response , why not use something a bit more refreshing ? e-mail to a friend			0

airlines and hotels use smell as a branding tool to create *positive* memories
creating associations with a fragrance is a powerful way to enhance the brand
@entity120 has been using smells since 2006 in its @entity122 and @entity6
