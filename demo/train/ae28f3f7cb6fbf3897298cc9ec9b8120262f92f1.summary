-- the @entity1 in @entity3 's capital is everything you would expect of a leafy lane in a quintessentially @entity8 suburb			1
the @entity10 botanical gardens -- home to a myriad of rare and exotic plants -- sit alongside the center of a @entity16 passion that is @entity17 -- the site of the annual @entity19			1
but beneath the genteel surroundings a simmering war is brewing , one that pitches fauna lovers against forehand followers and has battle lines drawn between the ornate , glass greenhouses of the gardens and the clay of the courts that welcome stars like @entity32 and @entity33 to the second grand slam of the year			2
welcome to the fight to expand @entity17			1
in one corner -- the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) -- which maintain the tournament has become a victim of its own success and has outgrown its current site following player complaints of cramped conditions			0
the @entity36 , as a solution , propose expanding into the botanical gardens next door , replacing greenhouses with a new arena fit to house some of the world 's best tennis matches			1
in the other corner , campaigners and local residents who accuse the tennis body of " environmental vandalism " and who bitterly opposed to the move			1
ahead of this year 's tournament next month , it looks like the row is destined to be thrashed out in the @entity3 courts			1
the opposition to the move hardened when the @entity36 voted in february to keep the @entity19 at @entity17 in the 16th arrondissement ( district ) of @entity65 rather than move to an alternative site			1
they rejected bids from three other venues in the inner and outer suburbs of the @entity3 capital , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 ( near @entity65 ) to the dismay of the anti-expansion campaigners			1
the @entity10 is one of only three botanical gardens in @entity65 and contain a series of unique greenhouses and campaigners say the very rare plant life will be lost forever			1
" what the @entity36 is proposing is the equivalent of @entity89 deciding to expand the @entity90 and take over @entity91 in the process , " @entity85 , who heads the campaign , told @entity0			2
@entity93 worked as an @entity95 speaking guide in @entity65 's @entity96 for 18 years until she retired and said she was " very distressed and very upset " by the latest developments			0
" we do n't have many botanical gardens in @entity3 and just three in @entity65 and @entity100 is the main one , " she added			1
under the plans , @entity17 will grow from its current 8.5 hectare site to 13.5 hectares , with a new planned show court in the corner of the gardens			1
@entity107 said that the encroachment will destroy the character of the gardens and the expansion would not stop there			2
" with over 40,000 people going through this botanical garden every day for a fortnight it will be destroyed and little by little more ground will be given over to tennis , " she added			2
the ' no ' campaigners , who also include local residents worried about the introduction of night matches and floodlights , have gathered an online petition of over 40,000 signatures and have vowed to fight on			2
but @entity126 , the chief executive of the @entity36 and the man responsible for overseeing the project , told @entity0 that the protesters fears were groundless			0
" i fully respect those who disagree with us but my concern is that most of the opposition is based on a lack of information , false information or false rumors , " he told @entity0			2
" i would not have supported any project in this gorgeous place that would have destroyed ancient greenhouses , " he added			0
his assurances over the future of the plant life cuts no ice with @entity85 , or that of the mayor of @entity65 , @entity146 , who campaigned to keep the @entity19 at @entity17			1
" the mayor is promising their relocation in an other ' wonderful place ' , located at the floral park in the @entity152 , " she said			0
" but there are no existing greenhouses there and none can be built because this is classified as a protected site			0
but the mayor and his staff can not tell the difference between a pavilion and a greenhouse			0
" there is no temperature control , shade or ventilation			0
" what is not in doubt is that the status quo was not an option with players such as @entity32 speaking out			0
" the players and the fans feel that even if it 's quite a nice experience it 's quite tough to live in every day			0
we need more room , " he said last year			0
@entity126 spoke with @entity32 and other leading players when drawing up his plans and found support from five - time @entity19 champion and @entity184 1 @entity185 , who wants the tournament to stay at @entity17			1
" i believe we are going to meet the expectations of the players and the fans , all of those who have a strong attachment to this place , " he said			0
but others were not so sure about the viability of the extension , with @entity3 's former @entity195 voicing her doubts			2
" i think that in @entity65 today we do n't have the possibility to have the necessary space to develop @entity17 , " @entity195 told @entity198			2
" we are the smallest of the four grand slams and i think it is important to have the chance to grow , and for the public to have more room			0
" @entity195 declined to be interviewed by @entity0 on the topic which has divided opinion in @entity3 with many such as @entity208 , the chief tennis correspondent of @entity209 , having conflicting views			1
" it looks very strange to put a tennis court on these gardens , it does n't suit the place			2
" but the tournament is for only two weeks and if you want to make room there is no other solution , " he added			0
@entity85 is adamant that power politics has played a big part in the decision			0
" the mayor of @entity65 has already lost the @entity225 to @entity226 ( for 2012 ) and could n't be seen as playing a part in @entity17 losing the @entity19			1
" i am a big tennis fan and i love watching the @entity19 but i am passionate in my opposition of these plans			1
" lawmakers in the @entity3 capital must decide if they want to make changes to the local urban plan to allow the planned expansion but only the @entity236 has expressed outright opposition			1
@entity85 and her followers are not hopeful of the outcome but she says they are prepared to take legal action to protect the botanical gardens and is also speaking with representatives of the three failed bids			1
" i have told them not to sell their land for other projects because in perhaps two years i am convinced the @entity3 federation will change their mind on this matter , " she added			1
but again , @entity126 has a completely different view and believes that once the political and likely legal process is exhausted that work will start in late 2012 and be finished at an estimated cost nearly $ 340 million by 2016			0
" we are breaking no law here , " he insists			0
" we are not ashamed of what we are going to do which will be in the best interests of sport and @entity3			2
" but even with the controversial expansion it will remain the smallest site of the for four slams , with @entity89 just over half as big again			0
" i do n't care about being the biggest , we have a gorgeous location in a gorgeous city and as long as we have that why should we go anywhere else ? , " said @entity126			0
" the best way to protect integrity of the tournament is to concentrate on the unique aspects of our tournament and make it even more unique			0
