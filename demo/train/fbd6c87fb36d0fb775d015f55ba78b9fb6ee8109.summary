-- a @entity2 judge denied a @entity4 request for a temporary restraining order monday that would have extended the organization 's ability to participate in the state 's revamped @entity8			1
a law going into effect tuesday requires the state to fully fund women 's health clinics with the exception of those that are affiliated with abortion providers			1
previously , such establishments obtained 90 % of their money through the @entity20 and other federal funding			2
@entity4 , which provides abortions at some of its clinics , and fellow plaintiff @entity25 of @entity26 , @entity2 , had filed the request for a temporary restraining order seeking exclusion from the new law , arguing the organization provides preventative women 's health care not associated with abortions to nearly 50,000 @entity2 enrollees annually			1
" i have denied the request for a temporary restraining order at this time , " judge @entity35 said			0
" i did not find that there would be an irreparable harm in waiting nine days for the injunction hearing			0

" i applaud all those who stand ready to help these women live healthy lives without sending taxpayer money to abortion providers and their affiliates			1
" with the temporary restraining order denial , women may not be able to access care through the @entity64 at @entity4 clinics , pending the result of the january 11 hearing			1
" it is shocking that once again @entity2 officials are letting politics jeopardize health care access for women , " said @entity68 , president and ceo of @entity70			0
" this case is n't about @entity4 -- it 's about women like @entity78 who rely on us for basic , preventive health care			1
