@entity0 -- a highly complex computer attack that may have been targeting @entity4 's nuclear power plants is posing a serious security threat to critical infrastructure worldwide , according to government and cyber-industry experts testifying wednesday on @entity10			1
the computer worm known as @entity12 was discovered this past july and specifically targets computers that run critical infrastructure such as the electric power grid , water treatment and oil and gas pipelines			1
the head of the @entity20 at the @entity21 said @entity12 is an incredibly large , complex threat with capabilities never seen before			1
" this code can automatically enter a system , steal the formula for the product you are manufacturing , alter the ingredients being mixed in your product , and indicate to the operator and your anti-virus software that everything is functioning as expected , " @entity23 told the @entity24			1
@entity23 called the development of @entity12 a " game changer			1
" @entity23 said there is not enough knowledge to identify what specifically was the target of the attack			2
" to say it was specifically designed to target a particular facility is very difficult for anyone to say with assurance , " said @entity23			0
however , a study by the @entity47 , a cybersecurity firm , indicated @entity4 's nuclear plants could be the intended target			1
" @entity12 is a threat targeting a specific industrial control system likely in @entity4 , such as a gas pipeline or power plant , " according to the report			1
@entity47 official @entity54 told the lawmakers that " even if something like this is tied to one particular country or group of countries , the ability of it to have a global reach is enormous			0
" he said there were approximately 44,000 unique @entity12 infections worldwide with 1,600 of them in the @entity67			2
nearly 60 percent of the global infections were in @entity4			0
who was behind the attack also remains a mystery			0
@entity21 's @entity23 said the department 's analysis of the code did not point to where it was developed			1
the @entity47 study did not identify a source of the attack			0
the sophistication of the malware makes it unlikely it could easily be duplicated by others			0
" @entity12 has such complexity requiring significant rescues to develop that few attackers will be capable of producing a similar threat , " @entity54 said			2
the discovery of @entity12 was a wake up call to government and industry , agreed all those who testified			2
@entity91 , the president of the @entity92 said , " we 're not only susceptible , but we 're not very well prepared			0
" enhanced cooperation between the federal government and private sector was cited as one key component to fending off cyber threats			0
sen. @entity99 of @entity100 , the chairman of the @entity24 , lamented that critical cybersecurity legislation needed to combat cyber threats will have to wait until the new @entity103 convenes next year			1
" i 'm sorry to say it seems unlikely we can pass this bill in this lame - duck session , although we should			0
i 've been disappointed that the administration and some other committees that have an interest in this issue have been slow to engage , " said @entity99 .			0

a @entity24 panel hears *testimony* about a new computer worm
it 's called @entity12 , and it targets computers that run critical infrastructure systems
the @entity21 's cybersecurity chief calls it a " game changer "
