-- by a substantial margin , the @entity1 on friday passed an extension of a controversial overseas wiretapping program , the @entity5			2
the law has already been reauthorized by the @entity7 , and president @entity8 is expected to sign it			2
according to sen. @entity14 , d - @entity10 , who is chairman of the @entity12 , the law , know by its acronynm @entity5 , has helped authorities prevent terrorist plots			1
" in the past four years , there have been one hundred arrests to prevent something from happening in the @entity20 , " @entity14 said			1
" some of these plots have been thwarted because of this program			2
i think it is a vital program			0
" but critics say the law gives intelligence agencies wide latitude in carrying out surveillance , under oversight by a special @entity5 court whose proceedings are not public			0
" it 's something with enormous potential for abuse , " said @entity33 , with the libertarian @entity34			1
" the @entity38 authorizes what the @entity39 was written to prevent , which is to say , general warrants -- blank checks for surveillance			0
" in 2005 , a national debate erupted when the @entity45 authorized by president @entity46 was revealed in the media			0
under that program , begun shortly after the 9/11 attacks , intelligence agencies could spy on communications between @entity20 residents and people overseas without a warrant , if it was believed one of the parties was linked to terrorism			1
the @entity5 law passed in 2008 required officials to obtain a warrant to spy on any @entity20 -- including , for the first time , @entity20 who are abroad			1
the law also established @entity5 as the exclusive means for authorizing electronic surveillance			0
privacy advocates say if a foreigner overseas is being wiretapped , which does not require a warrant , an @entity20 communicating with that person could still have their communications with that foreigner monitored			1
but defenders say the law contains provisions to protect privacy and prevent abuse , including a prohibition on spying on @entity20 except with a warrant			1
the @entity83 , the country 's primary surveillance agency , told @entity0 in a statement : " one of the biggest misconceptions about @entity83 is that we are unlawfully listening in on , or reading e-mails of , @entity20 citizens			1
this is simply not the case			0
@entity83 is unwavering in its respect for @entity20 laws and @entity20 ' civil liberties			2
" sen. @entity94 , @entity95 , proposed an amendment requiring more disclosure			0
" i think we ought to know , generally , how many @entity20 are being swept up under the legislation , " he said during thursday 's debate on the @entity1 floor			1
but defenders of the law say , the effectiveness of espionage programs depends on a level of secrecy			0
" it 's very hard to have covert and clandestine intelligence - gathering , if it 's not secret , " said @entity108 , an advocate of national security with the @entity110			0
without reauthorization , the law was scheduled to expire monday , at the end of 2012 .			0

the law has helped authorities prevent terrorist plots , says a senator
but " it 's something with enormous potential for abuse , " says a *member* of @entity34
the law , passed in 2008 , requires officials to obtain a warrant to spy on any @entity20
*opponents* say @entity20 communicating with persons abroad still could be spied on
