-- as a woman whose parents had cancer , i have quite a few things to say about dying with dignity			1
in 1984 , my mother was diagnosed with stage four cancer of the ovaries , uterus , ureters , small intestine , bladder and kidney			1
she was given six months to live			2
she refused to accept that and sought treatment in @entity19 , @entity20			2
her condition improved until two years later , when she was diagnosed with a brain tumor			2
her body was mangled from all the surgeries			2
she had to wear an ostomy bag , which i learned how to change because she was so weak			2
she had to give up her nursing career			2
she had to give up the fun things in life she enjoyed doing because her body could n't take it			2
she no longer had the quality of life that she deserved			2
my father , no longer physically attracted to her , satisfied his physical needs with other women			2
she was too sick to give him what he physically wanted			2
in 1988 , when she was well enough to be at home full time , my parents separated and filed for divorce			0
@entity43 broke their foundation of love and trust			0
the pain did n't stop there			0
in 1992 , she was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer and lost her breasts			1
the only part she felt that still identified her as a woman was taken away			0
the same year my father was diagnosed with brain cancer			1
he died quickly , three weeks after his diagnosis			1
he simply collapsed and died			1
my right to death with dignity at 29 for years , she suffered			1
it 's hard watching your mother cry over the pain			1
it 's hard watching your mother break down piece by piece			1
for years , she fought a pain pill addiction			0
she wanted to live so she could raise her children but in reality , she spent her time in the hospitals , operating rooms and doctor 's offices			1
her hopes took a horrible turn			0
she suffered greatly for 17 years until 2001 when doctors found cancer on her spine			1
she killed herself three days later			0
the person who died was not my mother			1
she was not the funny , intelligent , strong and fierce woman i knew			0
the person who died was sad and had lost all hope			1
my last memory of my mother is of this person			1
lying on the bed with a bottle of pills next to her and her eyes half open			0
there is no justice in her lasting legacy			0
she deserved to go in a more dignified way			0
dying with dignity is more than just for the person who is dying			1
it 's for their loved ones			1
if it meant my mother leaving this world the way she was in 1984 and not in 2001 , then i would have supported her decision to do so			1
my last memories of her should have been when she was still full of life on the outside , even though she was dying on the inside			0
she chose to take her life anyway , except it was without her loved ones surrounding her saying their final words and making peace			0
her death was treated like a crime scene because she killed herself at home			0
there were no final words			0
nothing but the unimaginable guilt i carry with me every day because maybe i could have done something better for her			0
the danger of assisted suicide laws it 's not fair to throw stones at someone because they are through fighting			1
no one person or disease is the same , so it 's unfair to judge and compare			1
just because a person decides they are done does not make them weak or selfish			0
dying with dignity is a brave decision to make			1
it 's a decision that involves everyone , and it 's one of the greatest gifts of love that person can give to those left behind			2
when assisted suicide is not the answer some say she beat cancer			1
she was given six months to live but lived for 17 years			0
but what kind of life was it ? was it a life worth living ? she had so much to live for , but at what cost ? what kind of life was it for her children ? i can tell you it was hard			0
i was robbed of a childhood			0
it was years of struggles and tears			0
i would never wish what i had lived through on anyone			0
no child should have to see their parents suffer so much			0
today , i 'm happily married and have a 4 - year - old son			0
i would never want him to watch either one of his parents suffer			0
if a diagnosis is final and the options are there , i just may choose to die with dignity and end my life on my terms			1
if you have to explain death , how hard is it to include dying before the suffering becomes too great ? sure , the experiences built me up to be strong and be able to handle some serious stress , and in part made me the person i am today , but i would gladly trade it back if my mother could have done things her way , when she really should have			2
