the biennial @entity0 began sunday with the @entity2 's major carriers announcing some of the biggest aviation deals in history			1
there was as much speculation swirling around the size of the orders before the event as there was desert sand outside the nearby @entity13 airport			2
however few predicted that $ 192.3 billion worth of deals for commercial jets ( at list prices ) would be announced on the first day -- a new record that has outstripped the orders from the entire 2007 airshow			1
the region 's three big players -- @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 -- announced orders for 393 new commercial planes			1
@entity28 and @entity29 shared the spoils , with high demand for the @entity32 , @entity28 's next - generation version of the existing 777			1
the @entity35 based airline @entity23 was the first to lay down a marker at the event : a $ 25.2b deal for 56 new wide - bodied @entity28 aircraft , including 25 @entity32 planes , 17 of the biggest 777 - @entity42 variants and eight of the 777 - @entity45 version			1
" this order enables us to build upon our achievements , using the next generation of aircraft to support our next generation of development , " said @entity23 ceo @entity46			1
" this order is for 2018 out to 2025/2030			0
" later @entity46 trumped his @entity28 order with an announcement for 87 @entity29 jets worth $ 26.9b at list price , including 50 @entity62 aircraft , the twin - aisle competitor of the @entity32 currently in development			1
the airline is also set to be the biggest operator of the @entity67 , with a new order for 30 of the new planes to add its current deal for 41 of the composite , medium to long - distance jets			2
but it was @entity76 's emirates that revealed the largest order with a $ 76b deal for 150 @entity81 planes , plus an additional 50 @entity82 , worth $ 23 billion , to bring its order of the superjumbo up to 101			1
the airline currently operates 39 of the world 's largest commercial jet			0
low - cost carrier @entity87 committed to purchasing 111 @entity90 jets worth $ 11.4b			2
@entity91 - based @entity25 added to the impressive figures for @entity28 's @entity32 with a $ 19b order for 50 of the aircraft			1
@entity95 will be the forth " launch airline " to receive the new model jet when delivery begins from 2020 onwards			0
it has 34 on order			0
the aircraft is the latest iteration of the company 's 777 series and will be manufactured with all new composite material wings			0
with a wingspan of 71 meters , the 777 - @entity42 is greater than the 747 - 800			0
" with around $ 100b worth of orders , this makes it the largest aviation product launch , " said @entity28 chairman and ceo @entity108			1
" we look forward to ... continuing to support @entity76 's expansion into a global aviation hub			0
" finding room for the new aircraft in @entity76 should not be a problem as the @entity117 is the city 's second international hub and predicted to be the world 's largest when completed			0
@entity76 's ruler @entity121 was at the show and supportive of the new airport and mega deals			2
" we can not operate from one airport with all these planes , " he told @entity126 's @entity125 after the @entity128 's announcement			0
" the passengers are growing so much and a lot of people are coming and going from here to @entity135 , to @entity136 and @entity137			0
so @entity24 has to be strong and so does @entity87			2
" @entity46 predicts passenger numbers for @entity23 to grow by 14 % annually for the next five years , while @entity139 , @entity24 ' ceo , believes the numbers will come as more countries open up			1
" we do n't want anything below double digital growth in passenger numbers , " he said			0
