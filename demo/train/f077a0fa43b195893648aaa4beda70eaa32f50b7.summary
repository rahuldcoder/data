-- new @entity3 signing @entity1 said his transfer deadline - day move to the @entity7 champions from division rivals @entity9 was a " step forward " in his career			1
after much media speculation over the striker 's future , @entity1 joined the @entity15 on a five - and - half - year contract on monday , in a deal secured just before the january transfer window came to a dramatic close			1
" i felt that i needed a step forward in my career and for my ambition as a footballer , " the 26 - year - old @entity1 said in an interview with the club 's official website on tuesday			1
" i am joining a team that is at the top level -- there is not another level after @entity3 , " he added			2
" when i played against @entity3 there was always a big motivation because it was a special game -- always one of the biggest games of the season			2
this is one of the reasons why i wanted to join @entity3 because i want to be part of this kind of team			2
" the @entity42 club compensated for the departure of @entity1 by signing two new strikers shortly before the 23.00 gmt transfer deadline -- @entity47 's @entity46 moved from @entity49 - side @entity48 while @entity51 's @entity50 signed from @entity52			1
@entity3 meanwhile coupled their @entity1 capture by completing the signing of defender @entity55 from @entity57 club @entity56			1
the best and worst deals of a dramatic deadline day the fee for @entity1 ' transfer has not been disclosed although @entity63 newspaper @entity62 speculated he had cost $ 80 million -- a figure that would break the previous @entity63 record set when @entity66 paid $ 53 million for @entity68 's @entity67 in 2008			1
@entity3 's big - money signing had spent three - and - a - half years at @entity9 scoring 81 goals in 142 matches			1
but following the side 's failure to qualify for the @entity74 and poor form in the league , @entity1 felt he needed to move to have the chance to challenge for silverware			2
" the @entity74 is a big ambition , it is a very important competition , " the former @entity80 player said			0
" but also @entity3 have the chance every season to win all the trophies that they play for , so when you have the chance to play in a team like this you can not say no. " ironically , @entity1 ' first match in a @entity3 shirt could be against seventh - placed @entity9 at @entity90 in a league clash on sunday			1
it is not thought he will feature in tuesday 's away fixture against sixth - placed @entity94			0
" it is like the destiny , " he said after a group of @entity9 fans were seen burning @entity1 ' number nine shirt outside @entity42 when the news of the transfer broke			1
" it is not perfect for me but we will see what happens and i only have good words about @entity9			0
they made me a top player and gave me the chance to play at the top level			0
i will never say anything bad about @entity9 , i have been very happy there			0
" but now the history is different and i am playing for @entity3			0
if i have the chance to play i will do my best for @entity3 and hopefully i can score			0
" @entity80 - born @entity114 added that his move had been made easier thanks to the support he had received from the @entity120 - based club 's loyal fans			0
" they really want me and it is important you have the support of the people in the club , and the support of the fans -- i have seen them very , very happy with me for joining @entity3			2
now i am very happy to be a @entity3 player			0
" will deadline - day spending buck @entity131 transfer downturn ? with @entity1 ' record - breaking deal and @entity9 reportedly paying in excess of $ 53 million for @entity50 , the @entity7 showed little sign of being affected by the current economic situation			1
according to statistics from @entity63 business advisory firm @entity139 , @entity51 clubs spent a record $ 363 million in the mid-season transfer window -- smashing the previous record of $ 282 million set in january 2008 , and far exceeding amounts spent by leagues in @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			2
however , @entity148 , a partner in @entity139 's @entity149 , said this can be solely put down to a handful of lucrative deals made by just four clubs			0
" we were surprised to see more than $ 360 million spent in a january window for the first time , particularly after only around $ 48 million was spent in january last year , " @entity148 told @entity0 in a statement			0
" when you scratch beneath the surface you find that around 80 % of the total spending is concentrated across @entity3 , @entity9 , @entity161 and @entity66 -- and spread across only six players			1
" so this was a particularly polarized window , with only a few clubs flexing their financial muscles , on what was a deafening final day of an otherwise quiet window			0
