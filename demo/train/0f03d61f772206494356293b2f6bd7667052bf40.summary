-- the tea party - backed challenger who narrowly lost a @entity4 primary runoff in @entity5 to longtime sen. @entity6 says he plans to file a legal challenge contesting those results " any day now			1
" state sen. @entity9 said friday on @entity0 's " @entity10 " that " the integrity of the process matters			1
we believe on that night of june 24 there were thousands of irregularities and we 've already found thousands of irregularities in the process			2
" @entity9 also defended his campaign 's offer - announced thursday - of rewards of $ 1,000 each for individuals providing " evidence leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in voter fraud			1
" and @entity9 said " we condemn any racist comments what so ever , " when asked by @entity0 anchor @entity29 about a bizarre @entity6 campaign conference call on wednesday that included borderline racist comments by an unidentified caller who appeared to be a supporter of the challenger 's campaign			1
led primary , lost runoff @entity9 narrowly edged @entity6 in a june 3 primary , but with neither man cracking the 50 % threshold needed to win , the contest moved to the runoff three weeks later , which @entity6 won by fewer than 7,000 votes			1
his victory was aided by votes from @entity47 , who were actively courted during the runoff by @entity6 's campaign and allied groups			2
according to @entity5 law , voters are not required to register with a political party , and anyone who does n't vote in a primary election can cast a ballot in either party 's runoff			1
since the runoff , @entity9 has refused to concede and has repeatedly vowed to use every legal maneuver available to fight the results			1
@entity9 alleges that some democrats who voted in the runoff had previously cast a ballot in their party 's @entity68 primary			1
" right now , we have found we have found more than 5,000 irregularities			1
there are more than 19,000 absentee ballots we still have n't seen yet , " @entity9 told @entity0			1
disputed claims the @entity6 campaign disputes @entity9 's claims , and numbers			2
" the time has come now for the @entity9 campaign to put up or shut up			2
if they have hard evidence , bring it forward			0
but quit talking about exaggerated numbers that they know are not true , " @entity6 campaign spokesman and adviser @entity82 said wednesday			0
after last week 's runoff , @entity9 's campaign dispatched volunteers across @entity5 to investigate the results in the state 's 82 counties			1
@entity92 , one of the anti-establishment groups that 's been supporting @entity9 , dispatched activists to assist the campaign			2
separately , a conservative outside group filed a lawsuit in federal court asking for full access to the voting records in the primary and runoff elections			2
wo n't drag out @entity9 said on " @entity10 " that the process " wo n't drag out too much longer			2
we have our people in the field			0
they 'll be working all next week to find the additional irregularities that we believe are out there			0
" @entity9 added that " after that , we 'll have our evidence together and move forward			0
" and he defended his campaign 's use of reward money , " if fraud was committed			1
" he added , " if vote buying took place as alleged , we have an obligation to find it and root it out once and for all			0
there 's nothing wrong with that process			0
it needs to happen for the integrity of the election process			0
" @entity9 pushed back allegations that he 's contesting the runoff results to further his political career and pay off campaign debts			1
" we do n't have any primary debt , not one dime , " @entity9 told @entity29 , adding that what he 's now doing is " bigger than a campaign , it 's bigger than a candidate , it 's bigger than me			2
" ' join us in the process ' and he urged the @entity6 campaign to " join us in this process			0
why not go out there hand and hand and lets find the corruption if it exists			0
" but that offer did n't fly with the @entity6 camp			0
" it 's obvious that @entity9 does n't care about the integrity of the process or he would n't be offering thousand - dollar bounties in e-mail fundraising blasts and flat out stating that the election was stolen and the election was a sham without any proof , " @entity6 spokesman @entity144 told @entity0			1
" so i think he needs to spare me the ' why wo n't they join us in protecting the integrity of the process			0
' @entity9 does n't care anything about the integrity of the process			0
@entity9 cares about staying in the spotlight			0
" @entity9 condemns race comments on wednesday 's @entity6 campaign conference call , a person who appeared to be a @entity9 supporter asked " since black people harvested cotton , why is it ok to harvest their votes ? why is it ok to harvest the votes of black people ? " asked about those comments , @entity9 said " we condemn any racist comments what so ever			1
but bear in mind , we have no idea who that person is			0
" he added , " you understand there are people out there we have no control over			0
" if his legal challenge to the runoff results is turned down by the courts , @entity9 told @entity0 that " certainly we 'll respect the court 's decisions			1
as to endorsing or going forward with @entity6 or whoever else , i 'm going to have to make that call after all this is said and done			0
