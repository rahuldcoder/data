@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's @entity3 is no place to live			1
at night it 's a freezing moonscape and when the sun comes up it becomes as hot as a burning skillet			1
there is little life and almost no water			0
the @entity11 has been described as the driest desert in the world			0
only when the " camanchacas , " or thick blankets of fog , blow in from the coast is there any precipitation			0
the brief watering can cause desert wildflowers to spring up and cover the rocky slopes in purple			0
but at the foot of a gold and copper mine a small and unlikely community -- part vigil , part refugee camp -- has also blossomed			1
it is called " @entity37 " or @entity38 and it is where many of the families of 33 miners have vowed to stay until their loved ones are pulled from the earth			1
it 's almost certain to be a long wait			1
two drills have already begun hammering away at the collapsed mine to free the men and a third is expected to begin work soon			2
even so , @entity1 mining officials say the men may not be freed until december			1
@entity47 is dug in for the long haul			0
she shares a tent with her sister in a row of encampments that line the road leading to the mine			2
on weekends more family members come			1
the rock wall behind her temporary home is a shrine to her younger brother @entity60 adorned with his picture , mining helmet and uniform			0
how faith is playing an important role for the families @entity69 's spartan quarters are luxurious compared to the living conditions the families first endured after the collapse			1
" it was empty , " @entity47 said			0
" after the accident we began to build a camp			2
but at first it was terrible : we slept outside and in the day it was boiling , at night freezing and the worst was we did n't know if our boys were alive			0
" seventeen days after the collapse , the families learned the miners had miraculously survived , but that freeing them would be an epic and lengthy undertaking			1
across the street from @entity47 's tent , @entity85 pours water on the ground to slow the flow of dust pouring into his tent			1
a 25 - year veteran of the mines , @entity85 worked at the @entity95 , but was n't inside when it caved in			0
three close friends of his were entombed in the mine			0
" it 's a job but with a risk			2
every day we walked in with the risk that something could happen , " he said			0
@entity85 lights candles to pictures of saints to assist the rescue , he sweeps and cooks and cleans for miners families to stay occupied			1
he does n't want to think about what his friends are going through			0
" i know better than anybody how they are doing			0
i have been where they have been , i know what it 's like in a mine			2
" the drilling at the mine is the constant backdrop and barometer for @entity124			1
its residents gaze out at the drilling to see if work is being done and if they can divine how much longer they -- and the miners -- will be here			2
they make small talk , watch tv in a cafeteria tent set up by the local government , or walk to the hill overlooking the camp to tend flags bearing the names of their loved ones			1
every day @entity139 watches a cell phone video of his son - in - law @entity141 , a self - taught musician , in which @entity141 plays a ranchera and sings to the camera with an easy smile			0
" i watch it all the time to feel close to him , " @entity139 said			0
" soon we 'll be with him , spending afternoons together , having him play guitar and harmonica			0
it 's the gift @entity153 will give us			2
" in the meantime , the families continue to lean on each other and fill the time			2
if the miners are a symbol of resolve for the world , their families want to provide their own example			1
after the mine collapse , many of the families did not know each other , said @entity47 as she greeted new friends passing her tent			1
" now i see them and we are one family			2
we worry , talk and fight for each other			0
" " what happened here was 33 families became one			1

" @entity124 " is a *makeshift* tent community set up by the families of the 33 *trapped* miners
family members are living there despite the harsh conditions of @entity1 's @entity3
the tent *village* is part refugee camp , part vigil to the miners
the men may not be freed until december
