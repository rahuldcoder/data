@entity0 -- a top @entity3 senator used the terror bombings in @entity5 to raise new questions on friday about a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill , legislation that now faces growing questions from conservative critics			1
immigration reformers seek to avoid deja vu democrats should n't rush the legislative process " given the events of this week , " @entity15 's @entity14 said at the opening of a @entity19 hearing on the nearly 900 - page bill			1
" it 's important for us to understand the gaps and loopholes in our immigration system , " @entity14 said			1
" how can individuals evade authorities and plan such attacks on our soil ? how can we beef up security checks on people who wish to enter the @entity33 ? " " this hearing is an opportunity to refocus on ... the importance of remaining vigilant and secure in our homeland , " he added			2
one of the bill 's authors , @entity43 @entity42 sen. @entity41 , responded by urging fellow senators to " allow the actual facts to come out " before " jumping to conclusions about @entity5			1
" two other leading @entity47 asserted in a written statement released after the hearing that the @entity5 bombings actually highlighted the necessity for immigration reform			1
" immigration reform will strengthen our nation 's security by helping us identify exactly who has entered our country and who has left -- a basic function of government that our broken immigration system is incapable of accomplishing today , " said @entity54 's @entity53 and @entity56 's @entity55			1
" we have 11 million people living in the shadows , which leaves this nation vulnerable to a myriad of threats , " they added			0
" by modernizing our system of legal immigration , identifying and conducting background checks on people here illegally , and finally securing our border , we will make @entity33 more secure			1
" overall , the issues of border security and economic concerns dominated the first committee hearing on the long - awaited plan , which was unveiled against the backdrop of the deadly @entity85 bombings and subsequent manhunt			1
" @entity88 " confident immigration bill can break @entity19 gridlock homeland security secretary @entity90 was scheduled to testify , but canceled her appearance on friday morning as the @entity5 - area manhunt intensified			1
" there is a great deal going on in @entity98 , " said sen. @entity93 , @entity94 , the panel 's chairman			2
" i hope everybody will understand why the @entity100 will not be here			0
" bombing manhunt : where is the suspect hiding ? @entity93 promised she would testify on the bill at a later date			1
tighter security has long been a key immigration reform demand for many conservatives , who argue that current border controls remain insufficient			1
@entity112 's rapid response to immigration reform critics the two prime suspects in monday 's bombings came to the @entity33 in 2002 and 2006 , according to a federal official			1
both suspects were in the country legally			0
one of them became a @entity33 citizen last year , an official told @entity1			0
the bill assembled by the @entity19 's " @entity125 " -- comprised of four @entity42 and four @entity3 -- would , among other things , commit $ 3 billion to enhanced border security			1
money would be used to fortify border fences , boost patrols , and acquire surveillance technology from the @entity131 -- including drones and drone pilots			2
the legislation would require constant surveillance of high - risk border areas and require that border officers turn back at least 90 % of those who attempt illegal crossings each year			2
vulnerable sections of the border would have to be deemed secure before most of @entity33 's roughly 11 million undocumented residents could begin the journey to citizenship			2
read the immigration reform bill some conservatives are skeptical the @entity147 administration will ever secure the border to their satisfaction			1
many reform advocates believe conservatives want to use the border security issue to deny citizenship to undocumented residents			1
it 's not right to put undocumented residents at the " mercy " of a border security requirement , @entity93 argued			1
and " spending billions more " on border controls , like fences , are not the " best use of taxpayer dollars			2
" but the bill is a " product of compromise " and " difficult concessions " on all sides , he added			2
testimony from the hearing 's two remaining witnesses focused on the economic impact of immigration reform , and whether it would damage job and wage prospects for citizens on the lower rungs of the economic ladder			1
" we have an abundant supply of low skilled labor waiting for jobs , " argued @entity177 , a member of the @entity178			0
sweeping legalization of undocumented workers will result in the " leapfrogging ( of ) those individuals			0
" and " we 're living in a fantasy land " if we think " by a stroke of a pen " the economic prospects of undocumented residents will be significantly improved , he added			0
@entity193 sen. @entity192 agreed , arguing that @entity33 has " more low skilled labor than we can find jobs for today			2
" " i think this ( fact was ) not considered properly in this bill , " said @entity192 , who declared that the legislation was written by " big business " and " big agricultural interests			0
" but @entity202 , a leading @entity193 voice on economic issues and former head of the @entity206 , insisted that illegal immigration is n't the main problem for the country 's low skill workers			2
@entity33 workers with few skills are being forced to compete globally , he told the panel			0
" geographic location has very little to do with it			0
" legalizing undocumented workers will help " eliminate the capacity for exploitation , " he added			0
under the bill , most undocumented immigrants who arrived in the @entity33 before december 31 , 2011 , would be eligible for legal residency and ultimately citizenship			2
they can not , however , have any felony convictions in @entity33 or foreign courts			0
smaller offenses can also block residency			0
the bill would block applicants with more than three misdemeanor convictions , including for offenses such as reckless driving , trespassing or vandalism			0
the bill would also require undocumented immigrants to pay a penalty of up to $ 500 for having come to the @entity33 illegally , and also pay any back taxes before receiving temporary approval to stay			0
after 10 years as provisional residents , immigrants could become lawful permanent residents by following the same guidelines as immigrants who enter the country legally			0
that process includes a $ 1,000 fee			0
the @entity19 is set to hold another hearing on the bill on monday			0
full @entity19 consideration would likely occur in june , according to multiple sources			0
a bipartisan group of legislators in the @entity253 is crafting its own immigration reform proposal .			1
