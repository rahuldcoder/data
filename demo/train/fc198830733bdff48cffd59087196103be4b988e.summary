-- when @entity2 became @entity4 's top securities regulator in october , investors hoped that he would bring a reformist zeal to the job that would help break the stock market 's two - year losing streak			1
they were right about the zeal but wrong about the impact on the market			2
barely a week has gone by without the regulator announcing another new measure to improve the functioning of the country 's beleaguered market			1
but after a brief climb upwards , the benchmark @entity16 is down nearly 13 per cent since mr @entity2 took office			1
it is premature to dismiss his reforms as a failure			2
over the longer term , analysts say that mr @entity2 's reform programme is putting the @entity4 stock market on a more solid footing , helping to ensure that it will serve as an important channel for direct financing in an economy that has long been overly reliant on banks for credit			1
in the short term , the main problem is straightforward : @entity4 's economic weakness			1
as @entity4 companies report their first - half results , there should be little doubt about why the stock market has struggled this year			1
" forecasts of company earnings have been continuously revised downward since the beginning of the year , " @entity41 , an analyst with @entity42 , wrote in a recent note			0
profits at industrial groups slid 2.2 per cent in the first half , sharply down from a 29 per cent gain in the same period last year , according to the national statistics bureau			0
the government has started to loosen policy , cutting interest rates twice and encouraging banks to lend more to infrastructure projects			0
however , compared with late 2008 when it unveiled a mammoth stimulus package , @entity57 has been much more tentative this time around and liquidity remains relatively constrained			0
given the bleak corporate backdrop and the muted policy support , a stock market rally this year would have been surprising and divorced from the fundamentals of the economy			2
for mr @entity2 's part , analysts say it is reassuring that he has not been sidetracked by concerns over market weakness			1
one episode highlighted this point last month			0
retail investors , who account for about three - quarters of the daily turnover in the @entity4 market , launched an online petition that attracted nearly 10,000 signatures in two weeks			1
their aim was to get the regulator to halt initial public offerings , believing that a cap on the supply of new equities would give a lift to the market			2
" behind every retail investor , there stands a family that has been deeply hurt by the endless ipos and the poor performance of stocks , " the petition read			0
the @entity94 had halted ipos in late 2008 after the market crashed , so there was a precedent for such a move			0
but this time it issued a rebuff			0
" based on previous experiences , suspension of @entity91 does n't help improve the market environment in any substantial way , " the investor protection bureau said in a statement			2
another indication of mr @entity2 's commitment to press on with reforms even at the risk of hurting sentiment has been his focus on devising a better system to delist shares			1
one of the oddities of the @entity4 stock market is the more than 150 shares that have st before their company name			1
@entity121 stands for " special treatment " and it means that a company has made losses for two consecutive years			0
although mere shells of companies , they have hung around on @entity4 's main board and continued to suck in money from investors taking a punt			1
to stop this from happening , the securities regulator plans to put a 1 per cent ceiling on how much an @entity121 share can rise in any given day and also to force persistently weak stocks to delist			1
investors are struggling to digest these changes , but ultimately , they will improve the overall quality of the market , says @entity140 of @entity141			1
not all of mr @entity2 's moves have been tough medicine for the market			1
some have been aimed precisely at boosting short - term investor confidence			0
he has called on listed companies to increase dividends			0
over the weekend , the securities regulator announced that it would cut transaction fees on stock trading by 20 per cent			1
with the @entity16 up for three straight days , a rare winning streak in recent months , some believe the market might have finally found a bottom			2
@entity157 , an equity strategist at @entity158 , a domestic brokerage , disagrees			0
he believes that economic worries will push @entity4 stocks lower again in the coming months			2
but beyond that , he is optimistic that the regulator is finally getting it right			0
" the stock market will only play a more and more important role in allocating capital and raising financing in @entity4			2
the government is very focused on this , " mr @entity157 says			0
" this is the big direction , the big trend , and it wo n't change			0

investors had high hopes when @entity2 became @entity4 's top securities regulator in october
there are almost weekly new measures to improve the functioning of the country 's beleaguered market
still , the @entity16 continues its more than two - year slide
analysts : over long run , @entity2 's reforms will put @entity4 market on solid footing
