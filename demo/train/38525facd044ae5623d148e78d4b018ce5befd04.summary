-- last year we published a list of quintessential @entity4 experiences			1
you can find it here			1
they were n't necessarily the most patriotic , obvious or agreeable choices			1
@entity9 , bourbon , state fairs , @entity12 , what 's not to love ? apparently , plenty			1
because we 're gluttons for punishment -- or maybe just because we think we actually can please all of the people all of the time -- we 're back for round two			1
here 's our @entity25 of the most authentically @entity27 experiences this country has to offer			1
@entity30 boardwalks boardwalks have been enhancing beachside amusement since long before the @entity33 ' released their classic " @entity35 " in 1964			1
the first boardwalk was built in @entity37 in 1870 , when a railroad conductor was asked to find a way to prevent sand from filling shorefront hotel entryways			1
the innovation remains @entity27 's favorite wooden path , showing up everywhere from @entity44 , which was inspired by " @entity27 's @entity45 , " to the @entity47 series " @entity50 , " which takes place in prohibition - era @entity37			1
of course , you do n't have to travel to @entity52 to experience the joy of a lumber - pathed stroll ; there are more than 60 boardwalks split between @entity27 's coasts			1
@entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60 , includes roller coasters , carnival attractions , @entity64 hot dogs and other slices of @entity4			1
out @entity66 , the @entity67 in @entity68 offers bodybuilders , artists , trinket sellers , magicians and boutique shops a place to be seen			1
pueblos and powwows one of the most inspiring @entity27 experiences is witnessing the culture of the first @entity79 come alive in a spectacle of swirling , pulsing color			1
every april , approximately 3,000 @entity84 dancers and singers from roughly 700 tribes come together in @entity87 , @entity88 , to compete and celebrate their heritage			1
the teams blend traditional style with modern , innovative techniques , so the result is more than just living history , it 's the evolution of a culture that most @entity79 think has all but died away			1
in the same area are many pueblo sites that provide tours of cave dwellings and indigenous architecture			1
perhaps the most memorable is @entity102 , 2Â½ hours northwest of @entity87			1
this village of adobe buildings has been continually occupied by @entity79 for more than a thousand years			2
@entity102 , 120 @entity105 , @entity102 , @entity88 ; open 8 a.m. -4:30 p.m. ; closed for about 10 weeks in late winter and early spring ; $ 10 for adults ; 575 - 758 - 1028 @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity87 , @entity88 ; 505 - 836 - 2810 3			1
@entity110 , @entity111 forget national pastime -- to some @entity79 , baseball is a national religion			1
@entity110 in @entity111 , regardless of denomination , is their @entity117			2
@entity119 's @entity118 has two years on @entity110 ( the former was built in 1912 ) , but @entity118 has had more significant updates			2
like a giant video display installed in 2000 , and extra seats and luxury boxes that have been added time and time again			2
by contrast , @entity110 has remained fairly true to its roots			2
it 's a classic jewel box design -- green seats , open roof , exposed steel , brick , stone -- with ball - swallowing ivy - covered walls			1
there 's truly no better place to watch a game if you want a direct link to nearly a century of baseball history			1
if you 're in @entity111 during the off - season , no worries			2
the park provides 90 - minute tours year - round			2
@entity110 , 1060 @entity147 st. , @entity111 ; tours $ 24 for individuals ; 773 - 388 - 8270 4			2
college football , anywhere ( though @entity150 ai n't bad ) let 's not kid ourselves			1
football is the true national sport of the 21st century			1
while it does n't get much more @entity27 than the @entity158 , we 'd argue that the most enjoyable , purest way to experience the unique @entity27 - branded mixture of militant strategics , refined athleticism , brute force and exploitation of young labor is at a college football game			1
best to get there early enough to tailgate			2
bonding with strangers , drinking and grilling beforehand is 72.4 % of the experience			2
pretty much any stadium will do , but a game experience does n't get much better than at @entity172 in @entity173 , @entity150 , home of the reigning national champion @entity174			2
( yes , we know , the barbecue is spicier and the cheerleaders are hotter at your team 's stadium , but we had to draw the line somewhere and " national champs " earns you the top spot on lists like this			2
) @entity172 , 920 @entity186 dr. , @entity173 , @entity150			2
@entity187 there 's one more sporting event we have to include on the list			1
sure , other countries have their horse races			2
but those competitions were n't founded by the grandson of @entity196 of the @entity197			2
also , those races do n't have a traditional drink made of bourbon ( mint julep ) , nor do they encourage everyone to dress like a flamboyant @entity204 aristocrat			1
we 're talking bow ties , seersucker , bold pastels and spectacular hats that put @entity211 royal wedding attendees to shame			0
@entity212 , 700 @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215			0
; may 3 - 4 , 2013 ; single day general admission $ 25 - 40 ; 502 - 636 - 4400 6			0
burning man the first @entity218 in 1969 was one of the most pivotal moments in @entity27 cultural history			0
five - hundred - thousand people came together to celebrate drugs , weirdness , creativity , individualism , beauty and sticking it to the man			0
what 's the direct descendant of @entity218 ? before you say @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 or any other trendy music festival -- each of which is run by the man -- let us stop you			1
the world 's largest festival of artistic expression is burning man			0
the weeklong event held every year in the @entity245 of northern @entity246 is difficult to describe			0
as the website puts it , describing @entity238 is " like trying to explain what a particular color looks like to someone who is blind			1
" essentially 50,000 creative spirits gather in one of the most desolate areas in the continental @entity27 to wear bizarre clothes , make art , do drugs , experience a new form of communal living , have a hell of a lot of fun and let their freak flags fly			0
burning man ; august 26 - september 2 , 2013 ; 415 - 863 - 5263 7			0
soul food it 's difficult to pin down the most @entity27 of foods			1
almost every candidate has roots in other countries , but , of course , that 's what makes them @entity27			0
soul food makes the top of the list because it 's delicious , unapologetically artery - clogging and it brings us face to face with our turbulent past			1
@entity281 - @entity27 slaves on @entity204 plantations were often given scraps and leftovers to eat , and had to make do with whatever vegetables they could grow nearby and with little care , as so much time was spent working			0
from these restrictions arose some of the finest recipes in @entity27 cuisine			0
there are thousands of spectacular soul food restaurants -- many of the best are in the @entity204 -- but @entity294 's in @entity60 is maybe the most well known			1
@entity294 's , 328 lenox ave. , @entity60 ; 212 - 996 - 0660 8			0
juke joints while we 're in the region , one of @entity27 's great art forms , @entity296 music , grew up in the juke joints of the @entity204			0
@entity303 arose after emancipation , taking the form of shacks and private houses where @entity281 - @entity79 gathered to listen to and play music , gamble and dance			0
a few classic juke joints still remain , some along @entity311 , aka the @entity311 , which stretches from @entity312 to the town of @entity314 , @entity315 , an @entity27 experience in and of itself			0
@entity317 's , opened in 1963 outside @entity318 , @entity319 , is considered one of the last remaining original jukes			0
it 's only open thursdays , and it 's not easy to get to , but the music and crowd make it worth the trip			0
@entity327 ; @entity328 , @entity318 , @entity319 ; 662 - 843 - 2712 9			0
@entity330 light displays sure , other countries have @entity330 lights ( or fairy lights , in the @entity211 ) , but no one else takes it quite as seriously as @entity79			0
the lighting of the approximately 80 - foot tall @entity338 spruce at @entity339 in @entity60 is practically a national event			0
but the greatest displays of holiday spirit can be seen in more rural areas			0
take @entity344 in @entity345 , @entity346 , which consists of seven miles and millions of lights , or the six - mile long @entity348 in @entity349 , @entity350			0
magical night of lights , 7000 @entity352 , @entity353 , @entity346 ; 770 - 945 - 8787 @entity348 , 465 lodge dr. , @entity349 , @entity350 ; november 8 , 2013 - january 5 , 2014 ; sunday through thursday until 10 p.m. and friday and saturday until 11 p.m. ; 800 - 624 - 6988 10			0
megachurches @entity79 know how to make praising @entity356 memorable			0
just look at gospel music and tent revivals			0
in modern times you need n't look much further than @entity362 brunches ( wash away your sins from the night before with spiritual songs and mimosas ) and megachurches			0
those giant boxes of worship are where thousands of @entity369 gather not simply to pray and praise , but in many cases to eat , shop and work out			0
the @entity27 has more than 1,300 of them , and more than 50 draw a weekly attendance between 10,000 and 45,000			0
the mega-ist of @entity27 megachurches is @entity378 in @entity379 , led by senior pastor @entity380			0
every week his message is broadcast to 7 million viewers in more than 100 countries			0
@entity378 ; 3700 @entity384 , @entity379 ; 713 - 635 - 4151			0

@entity386 and powwows in @entity88 *highlight* @entity84 culture
baseball , football and the @entity187 made the cut -- yes , we love sports
what would the country be without soul food ?
we tried to resist including @entity238 , but failed
