@entity0 -- president @entity2 on friday asked @entity3 to provide $ 60.4 billion for states affected by @entity5			1
@entity2 's request , made in a letter , falls short of the total damage estimate in affected states			2
@entity11 gov. @entity10 said last week the latest estimates of storm costs in his state were $ 36.8 billion , while @entity0 gov. @entity15 told reporters the total cost in his state was $ 41 billion			1
in a joint statement friday , @entity10 and @entity15 said they have been working with @entity2 , administration officials and congressional delegates on relief			1
" today 's agreement on the administration 's request to @entity3 would authorize more than $ 60 billion in funding that will enable our states to recover , repair , and rebuild better and stronger than before , " they said			1
the money will go toward recovery , as well as preparing their states for future natural disasters , the governors said			0
four @entity38 senators , @entity39 and @entity40 of @entity11 , and @entity41 and @entity42 of @entity0 , said the funding would be a start			1
" there is a great deal of flexibility that better allows us to help homeowners , small businesses , hospitals , beach communities and localities rebuild , repair and protect themselves , " they said in a statement			0
the four expressed concern , though , for what they were sure would be future requests for additional funds as their " states ' needs become more clear			0
" " this is going to be a tough fight in the @entity3 given the fiscal cliff , and some members have not been friendly to disaster relief , " their statement read			2
@entity71 mayor @entity70 , acknowledged the deficiency in the request , but emphasized the need for quick action by @entity3			0
" while the total funding request released by the @entity78 today is not everything requested , we have always been realistic about the fiscal constraints facing the federal government , " @entity70 said			0
" we need a full recovery package to be voted on in this session of @entity3			0
any delay will impede our recovery			0
" rep. @entity86 , @entity87 , said @entity2 's request was not enough			2
" i disagree with president @entity2 's decision to not fully request the funding the states of @entity11 , @entity0 and @entity92 say they need to recover and rebuild from the unimaginable , widespread damage caused by @entity5 , " @entity86 said .			1
