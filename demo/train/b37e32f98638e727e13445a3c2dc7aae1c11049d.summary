-- the tragic death of @entity2 , a 21 - year - old intern at @entity3 , has cast a spotlight on the extreme work culture in the financial industry			1
the hours that @entity2 had been working are not unusual			2
many finance professionals often work into the wee hours of the morning			1
their weekends are spent recovering from grueling workweeks			0
their holidays are spent constantly checking in with the office			0
the result is that work begins to take up nearly every waking hour			2
there is little time left for life			0
the extreme work culture used to be the preserve of a few elite professions , such as banking or law			1
now it seems to be spreading			0
employees in many jobs are being asked to make themselves constantly available			2
partly , it 's because new technologies allow people to be connected and reachable at all times			2
but it comes at a huge cost			0
there is a significant body of research that shows long working hours have negative physical and psychological effects on people			1
a recent study by professor @entity39 tracked investment bankers over a nine - year period			0
these bankers would routinely work from early morning to well past midnight			2
to cope with these hours , many became gym junkies , taking to the treadmill after midnight for an hourlong run			0
however , after about seven years of this relentless grind , the bankers began to suffer serious psychological and physical breakdowns			0
in addition to damaging the body and mind , long hours at work cut people off from their family and friends			1
people who spend most of their waking hours at work or dealing with work - related activities have little time to build and nurture relationships outside of work			1
their intimate relationships with family can become strained			0
their friendships can become weak			0
if something goes wrong , they may feel isolated and helpless because they lack a healthy ecosystem for emotional support			0
the result is that their social network withers and , over time , can die			0
extreme hours have been proven to be unhealthy for workers			1
they are also bad for communities			2
if days are spent only working , then there is little time to put into local clubs , faith groups and associations			0
@entity85 professor @entity84 has pointed out that the long working hour culture has led to a stunning decline in the numbers of people who are members of clubs and associations			1
it has effectively weakened the fabric of our communities			0
people are increasingly cut off , to the extent that it 's common not to know your neighbors or anyone in your neighborhood			2
what is perhaps most surprising is that long hours are not even good for companies			1
the most productive countries among the developed economies often have the shortest work hours			1
employees in @entity108 and @entity109 work less hours but get more done			1
their @entity111 counterparts spend much longer at work but produce far less			0
not only that , when people are tired from long hours , they tend to make more irrational and risky decisions			1
a recent study by the @entity117 sociologist @entity116 has shown that long hours at work also lead to the prevalence of unproductive " empty work " such as checking @entity120 , watching @entity122 videos or even undertaking personal projects at the office			1
it 's possible that these are ways for employees to show resistance			2
there are so many good reasons to end the extreme work culture			1
but how can it be done ? a first step is for companies to introduce policies and practices that stop employees from working through the night			1
these might include having work - life balance programs , or closing the doors to the office at a reasonable hour or banning e-mail traffic after a particular time at night			0
as important as these top - down changes are , employees need to instigate bottom - up changes			0
these require us to avoid modeling and encouraging the practice of working long hours among new recruits			1
we have to make it acceptable to say " no " to an extreme work culture			1
remember , we work to live , not live to work			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .			2
