-- damn those extreme @entity1			1
president @entity2 and @entity4 press secretary @entity3 have found @entity1 guilty of extortion and blackmail			1
@entity7 , per a report in @entity9 , once christened @entity1 as terrorists			1
liberals have led a media assault , calling the @entity1 anarchists , jihadists , " gun to head " hostage takers , and the political equivalent of the @entity17			1
@entity4 advisor @entity18 has likened republicans to suicide bombers " with a bomb strapped to their chest			0
" what could be more extreme ? the @entity25			1
true , the @entity27 wing in the @entity28 is relentless , uncompromising and unmoved by practicality			2
as we all know , there are perhaps 40 or so " bullet - proof @entity1 " in the @entity4 , in safe @entity1 districts , invulnerable except to @entity34			1
they fear a fellow @entity1 getting to their right in a primary more than a long - shot @entity25 opponent who would paint their district blue in a general election			1
no doubt , the @entity1 is a party divided , but there are a lot of @entity25 in safe districts , too			1
why do n't they fear a fellow @entity43 getting to their left in a primary ? why are n't the @entity25 a party divided between a centrist mainstream and a more extreme , radicalized left ? let us count the reasons : @entity2 has taken the @entity25 left of @entity52			1
he left blue - dog , centrist democrats to be punished for his sins and they were wiped out in the @entity1 's 2010 @entity57 landslide			1
all the while , the @entity58 has empowered and organized the party 's remaining and most extreme elements			1
the @entity25 ca n't go left			1
it is left , in entirety			2
they already occupy @entity65 's left fringe			1
@entity52 's new democrats are dead			1
this is not @entity68 's @entity25			1
today 's @entity25 belongs to @entity69			1
it is the party that just nominated a @entity71 trainee who returned from @entity72 with " a vision of unfettered leftist government " for mayor of @entity76 , according to the @entity77			2
and today 's democrats think this is a good thing			1
they dream audaciously , as @entity81 wrote in the @entity82 , of a new " @entity83			0
" as @entity84 noted in a @entity86 piece , " @entity91 , " " @entity88 's win in @entity76 's @entity25 primary is n't a local story			1
it 's part of a vast shift that could upend three decades of @entity65 political thinking			2
" the @entity25 is now animated by the " mobilized left , " @entity84 writes , emboldened by internet activism			1
their cause was galvanized by president @entity2 's seemingly impossible re-election			2
once , @entity2 may have campaigned as a centrist , but that was long ago			0
he has since governed as an old school economic liberal from the ' 60s			0
as @entity103 has noted , @entity2 has been " @entity104 without the experience			0
" @entity2 's answer to every economic challenge has been top - down			0
our governing class knows best , he believes , especially since @entity112 's elite now includes him			0
if the world has changed in eight decades , our president has n't noticed			0
his view of government is cast from the bronze of @entity118 and the ' 30s			2
he puts our big , dumb , inflexible public sector at the top of @entity65 life , to mandate redistribution and prosperity			0
at every opportunity , he has grown the public sector 's archaic program - and - policy factory			0
this empty presidency tries only to cure too much old government with even more of it			0
though little of what he has tried has worked , it has not seemed to deter his party			0
it has n't deterred him			0
his government does n't govern education : the @entity65 educational system barely edges out nations such as @entity139 , in international rankings			0
his government does n't govern retirement : our public - sector retirement system is akin to an unsustainable ponzi scheme			0
his government does n't govern health care : the @entity146 is making health care more unaffordable for many seniors			0
his old government does n't govern our economy : a record high 89 million @entity65 do n't participate in the workforce and 300,000 more dropped out this august			0
@entity2 is building the largest public sector since @entity153 and , yet , our government governs nothing			0
still , an intellectually exhausted @entity25 proposes nothing new			2
if at first you do n't succeed , keep trying until you are $ 20 trillion in debt and failure litters your streets			0
the rollout of the @entity146 website is but another symptom of an old , hierarchical bureaucracy incapable of keeping pace with the complexities of a modern , adaptive @entity65			0
@entity167 is the best old @entity112 can do , not the worst			0
while our world transforms itself through revolutions in energy , technology and communication , the ideologists of the left stagnate			0
@entity2 's @entity25 is intellectually exhausted			1
their old @entity25 has nothing up its sleeves but more of the same			2
how our young president could only offer such dated ideas will be studied for decades			0
for now , we can mark candidate @entity2 's transformation from agent of hope and change to defender of liberal calcification as one of the great sleight - of - hand tricks in political history			2
with any luck , he will be the last president who tried to teach our dinosauric public sector to dance to the music of a new and adaptive era			0
others , beyond @entity2 , will not expand but instead transform what we now pretend " governs " us			0
as for his legacy , today 's tweeters and texters will remember @entity2 as the last president of the @entity201 and once he is gone , there will be no cover for his party 's intellectual barrenness			2
@entity2 will leave a @entity25 epitomized by ancient ideas , radically positioned left of our political center			1
the political trouble @entity2 inherited from @entity210 is nothing compared to what @entity2 has teed up for a future contender such as @entity68			2
our former secretary of state has had no choice but to campaign for president earlier than she would have chosen			0
@entity52 can see that this radicalized @entity25 could easily leave her behind and find another champion			2
it did so before , to her distress , in 2008			0
no other member of the old @entity25 elite can possibly hold its left - sliding legions together , yet @entity68 has only one credential that appeals to her party : she could be our first female president			1
@entity69 's growing followers , more in tune with today 's radicalized , populist @entity25 , are likely to find that distinction unimpressive			1
if @entity52 's rationale begins to fray , all hands on deck : the @entity25 's 2016 nomination process is going to look like the casting call for " one - @entity235 - the @entity236			1
" @entity237 may have screamed his way past the @entity25 nomination in 2004 , but the revolution he started has borne fruit			2
the 2016 nomination battle may be a fight between @entity69 , @entity244 and @entity245 , an unpolished pack of ideological duds and even a reinvigorated @entity237 , all vying to out - crazy each other and take the @entity25 over a precipice			1
they 'll make the troupe that sought the 2012 @entity1 nomination look like the committee awarding the @entity254			1
which party is more extreme ? a @entity1 divided between 180 mainstream @entity4 members and 40 @entity27 mini-me 's ? or a @entity25 united to preserve our fossilized , ineffective public sector ? a @entity1 advocating a path to fresh , natural , economic growth ? or a @entity25 offering young voters the outdated economics of conformity , artificially imposed by @entity112 's elites ? a @entity1 being driven to offer change ? or a @entity25 united against it ? entrepreneurs , start printing tie - died shirts now			1
they will be hot sellers at the next @entity270			0
both sides are in for an interesting ride , but for @entity25 , it 's going to be an extreme 2016			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity275 .			2

@entity275 : while everyone focuses on @entity1 's right , the democrats are being ignored
he argues that @entity25 as a party have moved much further , in this case , to the left
democrats are celebrating the shift to a more liberal view of role of government , he says
@entity275 : @entity69 wing of party could make life *difficult* for @entity68 in 2016
