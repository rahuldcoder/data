@entity0 -- a bobsled guided by mind power , guns fired by blowing into a headset , desert waves created by nanobots -- the world of disabled athletes could be very different in the near future			1
a new exhibition of prototypes aimed at making sport more accessible has opened in the @entity15 capital , featuring innovative ideas from young designers			1
taking this year 's @entity0 paralympic games as their inspiration , students from @entity19 , @entity0 and the @entity20 have come up with 11 ingenious ideas that dream up new equipment and , in some cases , entirely new sports			1
the goal was to create a much more even playing field for athletes of different levels of ability , says @entity32 , a tutor on the @entity34 postgraduate course " when we started the project we said to the students : ' it ca n't be @entity41 ( comics ) , it ca n't be @entity42 ( a game in the @entity45 films ) , but it has to have something of that in there			1
' it 's all about imagination , and for the students here , that is their currency , " @entity32 , a course tutor at @entity19 , told @entity1			2
" headshot " -- a new take on clay - pigeon shooting for both the able - bodied and disabled -- is a good example			2
competitors don a special headset which translates head movements ( up , down and side to side ) into movements on a powered platform below			0
firing the gun is activated by blowing into a sensor on the headset			0
" it maintains the physicality of the sport and the man / machine connection , " says co-designer @entity68			2
" there is a strong sense of thrill as the gun is mounted on the body			0
we played with a few different ideas but we wanted to mimic the fine motor skills involved in shooting			2
" another prototype , " brainsled , " utilizes existing gaming headgear to let athletes steer a bobsled by the power of thought , allowing able - bodied and disabled athletes to pit their reflexes and powers of concentration against each other			0
the challenge has been sponsored by @entity94 ( provider of the metal for medals at @entity98 and @entity99 ) which awarded a Â £ 5,000 ( $ 8,000 ) development prize to the most promising design			1
that honor went to " ghost , " a haptic device mounted on the wrist and elbow which uses sounds and vibrations to tell the wearer when they are performing a particular motion correctly			1
the students imagine it helping to hone a swimming stroke , and @entity32 thinks it has " wonderful possibilities			0
" @entity117 , a visually - impaired parathlete who advised the students on the four - week project , was impressed with their efforts			0
" it 's not an easy thing to make work in such a short space of time , but it has a wide application and it 's exactly what we talked about , " he said			0
@entity117 , a former world and @entity132 paratriathlon champion who suffers from @entity134 , also praised " @entity135 " -- an idea which uses panels of color and textures on sports clothing to help visually - impaired athletes identify teammates			0
other stars of disabled sports were also on hand during the task including @entity15 paralympians @entity147 ( winner of 11 gold medals ) and javelin thrower @entity150 , who helped out with a new adjustable knee socket for a prosthetic leg			1
" it was really a meeting of minds , " @entity32 said			0
" the best design students in the world meeting the best athletes in the world			1
" other designs peered a little further into the future			0
" @entity170 " imagines waves created by " self - replicating nanobots " and " @entity164 " imagines athletes wearing prosthetic wings , while " @entity169 " is the name given to " a fast and furious wheelchair team sport			1

new design exhibition imagines new sports for future @entity99
