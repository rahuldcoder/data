if your romantic partner pointed you to an application for a one - way trip to @entity4 , would you be upset -- or thrilled ? when dr. @entity6 's husband sent her such an e-mail last spring , he said that he did n't want her to go but that he 'd be a lousy husband if he did n't tell her about it			1
fast - forward to today : @entity6 has made it past the first round of cuts for @entity13 , a nonprofit organization that aims to send four people to the @entity15 in 2024 and subsequent groups in later years			1
" most of us want to explore , want to go new places , and then it 's just a question of : how much are you willing to give up to do it ? " she said			1
@entity6 is one of 705 candidates selected from a pool of 200,000 applicants for the mission			1
the select group has been narrowed from 1,058 people as some prospective astronauts dropped out for personal or medical reasons , @entity13 said recently			1
all of the remaining candidates will be interviewed by the @entity13 selection committee			1
eventually , only four will be picked for the first trip			2
apparently , none of them is scared off by the idea that , because of technological and financial limitations , @entity13 astronauts would probably never come home			1
it might not actually happen despite growing excitement surrounding this effort , it is not clear that sufficient money will be raised to follow through			2
@entity13 ceo @entity47 has said the company is looking at " a range of funding scenarios			1
" a reality tv concept is one way @entity13 may make good on its $ 6 billion budget for getting the first four humans to @entity4			1
@entity47 hopes the unprecedented video opportunities will attract sponsors , partners and media coverage			2
but since no one has ever been to @entity4 , the technology to fly people there and keep them alive has not been tested there , either			2
@entity47 said last year that " no new inventions are needed to land humans on @entity4 , " and the website says the " plan is built upon existing technologies available from proven suppliers			2
" but the company will need to show that key systems involved in transportation and life support will work in untraversed territories			2
@entity13 announced in march that it will soon begin constructing the first of its " simulation outposts " to train selected astronauts and teams , giving them experience in an environment made to feel like a @entity4 home			1
@entity6 , 46 , an emergency medicine physician in @entity81 , is doubtful that @entity13 will deliver on the trip at all			1
but if it does happen , she is on board			0
" there 's no question			2
" settling away from your spouse you might think that trying to emigrate from our planet might put some pressure on @entity92 - based relationships			1
@entity6 and her husband have been married for 21 years and have no children			0
if she goes to @entity4 , she said , she will probably offer her husband a divorce but will wear her wedding ring regardless			0
he does n't want her to go , she said , but supports her following her dreams			0
" both of us are space enthusiasts , " she said			0
" humanity needs to expand off @entity92 if we expect the human race to succeed in any way beyond just basic survival			1
" @entity105 , 52 , another candidate , also believes humans should be spreading to other planets -- but his wife is not happy about @entity105 taking part in the mission			1
the couple , married 28 years , has two college - age children			0
" she 's concerned that she 's going to have to watch me die on television , " @entity105 said of his wife			1
it 's hard for @entity105 to think about leaving his wife and kids behind forever and never meeting future grandchildren			1
still , he likes the idea of making history and seeing things that no one has seen directly before			0
@entity123 and his wife , @entity124 , are getting around the marital tension issue by applying together			2
@entity123 says he could not go to @entity4 without her			0
sure , @entity4 might challenge their marriage , but enough marriages are strained on @entity92 already , he said			1
" one thing we do really well together is travel , and this would be a trip lasting the rest of our lives			0
i think we also are very good at helping each other out when we are stressed ; i would be a far worse space cadet without her			0
" a ' social experiment ' when you live far from people you 've known for a long time , you manage to make friends in your immediate area , and that 's what @entity147 thinks will happen on @entity4			2
the @entity150 student says @entity13 crew members may take the place of friends , family and significant others			1
even if @entity13 does n't land people on @entity4 in 2025 , it serves as a " social experiment " to get people talking and thinking about a @entity4 mission , she said			1
" what i learned in grad school is that you never really know what problems you 're going to come across until you actually try and do something			0
and the fact that they 're actually trying to plan it , means that they 'll come across the problems , " she said			0
" i believe that there are no problems humanity ca n't solve			2
" some candidates draw analogies to the early waves of @entity177 settlers in @entity178			0
immigrants did n't have a rover on @entity181 telling them about local conditions before they arrived , says @entity183			0
" you even could n't necessarily send a letter back to your family , " @entity6 said			0
" you were leaving everything for good			0
we at least will have the ability to use e-mail			0
" still , it 's a hard sell for friends of @entity193 ' , a @entity13 candidate who studies public health at @entity195			1
" usually , every time i tell somebody about the trip , they say it 's a ' suicide mission ' and ' you 're going to die on @entity4 , ' " @entity193 said			1
" well , we 're going to die here , too			2
so might as well live your whole life to the fullest			0
" funny he should mention that : the @entity207 ' religious watchdog , the @entity206 , recently issued a fatwa to warn @entity209 against the mission because " the chances of dying are higher than living			2
" @entity13 responded in a statement , asking the authority to cancel the fatwa			1
" @entity215 prohibits @entity209 from going to @entity4 , but not from applying to @entity13 's mission or training for the mission			1
in the next ten years , @entity13 is open to working with the @entity206 to assess the risk of the mission as the unmanned settlement is under construction , " @entity13 said			1
@entity223 is hopeful that his trip would n't actually be one - way			0
he believes it would be in the best interest of the mission to send the astronauts back : " imagine only the cost and tax on resources to care with someone elderly on a @entity13 colony , " he said			1
but the way that the mission is currently set up -- with no return plan -- he 's still interested			1
making happy @entity4 meals spending the rest of your life on another planet might make a person miss certain @entity247 conveniences like favorite foods			0
@entity105 said he 'd lose weight just to be able to take more chocolate with him , since there would be a limit of how much weight each person could contribute to the mission			2
@entity256 , another applicant , said he wants to make the first pizza on @entity4			0
@entity6 would miss hamburgers but has high hopes for being able to grow them herself , perhaps from cow stem cells using a technique demonstrated last year			0
how test - tube meat could be the future of food " the first hardest thing to give up would obviously be my husband , " @entity6 said			0
" the second hardest thing would be meat			0
" but for this opportunity , she would kiss them both goodbye			0
a one - way ticket to @entity4 , apply now 501 days in space with your spouse : could you handle it ?			0

@entity13 will select four astronauts for its first mission
candidate pool in current round stands at 705
some say humanity needs to leave @entity92 for survival
