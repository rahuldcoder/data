@entity2 marched up to the @entity4 counter in @entity5 , @entity6 , and handed the barista a napkin with his number on it			1
" call me sometime , " he said , hoping his voice hit a cool - guy tone , though he knew in reality it was probably cracking like a schoolgirl 's			1
@entity16 looked down at the napkin			1
@entity2 was handsome , well - mannered and professional -- just the type of guy he had always envisioned himself with			1
but he knew he would n't call			1
a couple years later , @entity16 was at the @entity19 in @entity5			1
a friend of his had met a great guy at a party and thought he 'd be perfect for @entity16			1
she invited both to the bar -- a sort of blind date in the midst of a group hangout			1
as @entity16 walked toward the guy , he realized it was the same @entity4 customer whose number he had secretly kept for so long			1
@entity2 tried to pretend he did n't remember but eventually cracked			1
" why did n't you call ? " he asked			2
@entity16 explained he had been in a serious relationship at the time			2
by the end of the night , the two had exchanged phone numbers			2
for the next week , they spoke on the phone every day for hours			2
on july 15 , 2004 , they went on their first date			2
" i always dreamt i would meet my future husband in line at the grocery store , " @entity2 wrote on @entity40			1
" i would be buying spaghetti , and he would be buying spaghetti sauce			2
our eyes would lock and the rest would be history			0
" " i always dreamt i would have a cute story			0
" the first date was followed by a second , then a third			0
they rented giant sumo wrestling costumes and battled each other in a friend 's backyard			0
they went horseback riding on the beach			0
for their six - month anniversary , they flew down to the @entity63			0
they took a road trip to @entity66 and spent months backpacking around @entity67			0
" it was like one of those crazy romantic movies , " @entity16 remembered			0
" nobody does dates like this , but we did them all			0
" on july 29 , 2011 , @entity2 slid a note under @entity16 's door while on @entity77 in @entity78 : " @entity80 , will you marry me today ? " today , @entity2 and @entity81 live in @entity82 with their son , @entity83			1
they disagree over small things -- movie selection , driving styles , which drawer to put the shorts in -- but agree on all the big things , such as their plan to adopt more children			0
with this kind of love story , it 's no wonder the couple believes so strongly in fate			1
one of @entity16 's favorite stories is from @entity100 's " symposium " : the @entity101 believed humans were originally created with four arms and four legs			0
fearing their power , @entity105 split them in half			0
" so you have a perfect match , " @entity16 said			0
" you just have to find it			0
