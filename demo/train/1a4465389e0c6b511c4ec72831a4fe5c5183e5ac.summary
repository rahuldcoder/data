@entity0 -- entrepreneurs of all stripes are cashing in on the @entity5 - sanity phenomenon as swiftly as the @entity7 sensation can pull off his furious fast breaks			1
it has been only three weeks since @entity5 , the 23 - year - old @entity10 - born point guard of @entity12 descent , came out of obscurity to lead the listless @entity14 to a winning streak			1
but while their winning run has come to an end , @entity5 has gone on to become a media and marketing darling			2
@entity5 - related products have become hot items			2
in @entity14 , merchandise retailers are doing brisk business selling @entity5 's no. 17 jerseys			1
" he 's made the @entity14 relevant again , " says @entity26 , manager of @entity27 in @entity28			1
@entity30 - demand ' in @entity31 " we constantly get @entity5 jerseys every day , " he says			1
" i put one in the window to show people we have them			0
a short time later , they 're gone			0
" just as nimble and quick are the publishers of " @entity38 : the @entity39 of @entity5 " by @entity40 , an electronic book that was turned around in just 72 hours			1
available wherever e-books are sold , @entity40 's insta - book costs just $ 1.99			0
according to @entity45 , fast - thinking authors have already churned out least seven e-books , all about the humble and wholesome @entity48 graduate			0
the other @entity5 - inspired titles include , " @entity5 : advice from @entity51 on @entity52 , " and " @entity53 of @entity5			2
" not to be outdone , @entity5 himself has filed to trademark " @entity38			1
" the application , filed through the @entity57 , would give him exclusive rights to put the signature term on more than 50 consumer products , including clothing , mugs and even action figures			0
@entity65 : ' everyone wants to be next @entity5 ' @entity5 is not the only one to file for a trademark on the term , but he stands a good chance of winning it , according to @entity71 - based trademark lawyer @entity70			1
but he would stand a poor chance if he filed in @entity31 , where trademark laws tend to favor early applicants			1
few can match the prescience of @entity76 , @entity77 a @entity79 manufacturer of basketballs and soccer balls			0
@entity83 , it turns out , have registered @entity5 's @entity85 and @entity79 names as trademarks in @entity31 and claim to have rights to the name of the @entity7 's latest star until 2021			1
@entity83 's claim , widely reported in local media , could block plans by major sporting goods companies to capitalize on @entity31 's growing interest on the new @entity7 standout			1
@entity5 , known in @entity96 as @entity97 , was born in the @entity10 to @entity12 parents with ancestral roots in mainland @entity31			1
according to government records , @entity83 applied for @entity5 trademarks as early as 2010 , the year he graduated from @entity48 and was ignored during the @entity7 draft pick			1
" our boss @entity106 watched a lot of @entity7 games and noticed @entity5 some time in 2010 when he was a nobody , " one of the partners in the company told @entity1			0
" we did not expect @entity5 would be such an instant hit			0
we are happy for his success and of course we feel extremely lucky			0
" @entity83 may have hit a jackpot if @entity5 's marketing magic continues			1
" in @entity31 , first - to - register gets the rights , " says @entity114 , a @entity0 - based intellectual property expert at @entity116			0
" @entity79 companies are aware of this system and use it to their advantage			0
we see this happen every day			0
it 's a big problem for companies and people trying to protect their intellectual property in @entity31 when they are not familiar with the @entity79 system			1
" marketing mavens are lusting to brand @entity5			0
" he 's the total package , a fine athlete and a wonderful story , " enthuses @entity129 , president of @entity31			1
" we think he 's @entity5 - credible			1
" @entity83 now makes @entity5 basketballs but soon might start producing jerseys and sneakers			1
" maybe we 'll open franchise stores in east @entity31 , " said the @entity137 partner			0
" now more and more companies are reaching out to us seeking business tie - up opportunities			0
" @entity114 says the @entity5 trademark that @entity83 owns applies to a grab - bag of uses and products , including basketballs , shoes , hats , toys and gym facilities			2
@entity83 claims trademarks for other basketball stars , including @entity153 , a @entity79 power forward who now plays for the @entity154			2
it also has a trademark on the @entity79 name for " @entity158 , " an apparent reference to retired superstar @entity160 , for use on balls			2
@entity160 , known as " @entity163 " in @entity96 , has been aggressively doing business in @entity31			2
now he is tightening his defense			0
this week , @entity160 filed a suit in a @entity79 court against @entity168 , another @entity79 sportswear and footwear manufacturer , for unauthorized use of his name			2
" it is deeply disappointing to see a company build a business off my @entity79 name without my permission , use the number 23 and even attempt to use the names of my children , " the basketball legend said in a statement			1
" i am taking this action to preserve ownership of my name and my brand			0
" still , intellectual property experts say it will be an uphill battle for @entity189 to claim trademark rights in @entity31			2
" @entity31 requires a high threshold to prove that one is famous , " says @entity114			0
" even if @entity160 is a big name today , he still needs to prove that he was already famous in @entity31 long before 1997 , when @entity168 first registered the name			2
" trademark infringements are common and persistent in @entity31 , @entity114 notes			2
@entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 are just some of the well - known multinational companies fighting long legal battles to protect their trademark			0
even @entity203 , the world 's biggest technology company , is embroiled in a trademark lawsuit over the sale of @entity207 in @entity31 , with a @entity79 company claiming that it owns the right to use the @entity207 trademark in mainland @entity31			1
