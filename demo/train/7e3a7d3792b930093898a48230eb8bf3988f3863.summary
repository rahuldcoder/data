-- residents of the @entity2 in south - central @entity3 are as diverse as the unique waterways that course through the heart of @entity7 country			1
of @entity8 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity10 descent , for generations these @entity13 have made their living from the water and sea , chasing after shad and crawfish or working on and supplying oil rigs and refineries			2
they 're also a resilient lot			2
a roster of hurricanes is a constant reminder of the dangers and damage wrought by nature : @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and , of course , @entity34			2
now the danger comes from the north , instead of the @entity37 , in the form of a historic flood			2
" people are used to flooding , " said @entity40 , president of the @entity41			2
" but they are more used to it coming from the opposite direction			2
" gov. @entity46 on tuesday predicted that as many as 3 million acres of his state could be affected by the flooding spawned by the @entity49			2
some 500 @entity51 members have been mobilized to meet the challenge			1
twenty - one parishes issued emergency declarations and 16 hospitals are identified as being at high risk			1
as has been the case upriver from @entity59 south to @entity60 , the @entity57 is predicting its system of levees and flood walls will hold , keeping the river from inundating most @entity3 towns and farms that line its banks			2
the @entity57 in the coming days is expected to decide whether to open the @entity68 above @entity69			1
it has n't been opened since 1973			1
such a move would spare @entity69 and @entity72 even more damage from the floods , but it would flood populated and rural areas in the swampy @entity2			1
the basin is home to the @entity77 and myriad tributaries			2
there 's plenty to worry about in communities such as @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			2
they have varying levels of flood defense			2
some residents are posting questions and fears on the @entity93			1
" i 'm going to wait a little longer " before deciding on evacuating , said @entity94 , 33 , of @entity85 , an @entity77 community that does n't feature a traffic signal			1
it does have a levee			2
@entity94 is too young to remember the landmark 1973 flood , but she knows what nature can dish out			1
@entity30 heavily damaged her residence in 2008 and , as the mother of two , she is paying attention to the latest developments			2
she considers the river dangerous			0
despite the number of workers at an oil refinery in town , many people have to go to @entity69 , about 40 miles east , to work and shop , she said tuesday			0
camping and fishing are popular in @entity82 , 20 miles south in @entity114			0
downstream , in @entity84 , teacher @entity115 , 42 , is glad the oil town has a sea wall , but she is concerned about water backing in from @entity120 and other waterways			0
" we are surrounded by water , " she said			0
" @entity84 is pretty much an island			0
" it 's the waiting on the @entity57 ' decision on the @entity68 that 's causing stress , @entity115 told @entity0			1
" they wo n't give us a definite yes or no if they will open it or not , " she said			1
like others , @entity115 's worried the water could remain for a couple of months and affect jobs			0
she 's also somewhat philosophical about the greater good when it comes to deciding on spillways and other efforts to channel water to less populated or less settled regions			0
" how do you decide whose life or property is more important ? " @entity115 asked			0
@entity84 is one of several areas that could be affected by the opening of the @entity68			1
opening it would relieve pressure on the levee system and reduce the record - setting volume of water heading down the @entity49			1
if that spillway is opened , @entity46 predicted that roughly 2,500 people and 2,000 structures would be at risk directly inside the floodway			1
another 22,500 people and 11,000 structures would be affected by backwater flooding , he said			0
on monday , officials began opening gates on another spillway , the @entity162 in @entity163 , @entity3 -- about 35 miles west of @entity72			0
twenty - eight gates were opened on monday and another 44 were opened tuesday			1
the @entity57 released maps outlining areas that could be flooded in the @entity2 if the @entity68 is opened			1
" they expect the height of the water to reach between 5 and upwards of 25 feet above ground elevation , causing flooding through many southern portions of our state , " @entity46 said			0
" we 've been hearing about the possibility of flooding , " @entity175 , who lives in the town of @entity177 , about 15 miles east of @entity84 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity178			0
" we 've not been hearing any specifics as to how high the water might get			0
" @entity177 residents remember the last time the spillway was opened , saying it put 3 to 4 feet of water in their homes			1
and it could be even worse this time , @entity189 president @entity188 said			0
what was farmland in 1973 is now residential land , he said			1
" at that time , we were not as populated			0
" @entity189 has already declared a state of emergency , and its website was directing residents to sandbag distribution centers			1
measures aimed at minimizing flooding were being implemented , @entity188 said			0
levees were being elevated and reinforced			0
" generally speaking , people are very concerned , " the @entity41 's @entity40 said			0
the western part of the parish is expected to see the largest impact , he said , adding @entity86 is expected to come through the flooding in pretty good shape			0
@entity189 has about 110,000 residents and has one of the strongest local economies in the state , with an emphasis on oil and gas , health care and seafood , @entity40 said			1
unemployment is low and the parish has retained strong home values , he said			1
in the @entity220 town of @entity221 , @entity218 said she is " going nuts " and trying to hope for the best , but " we 're expecting the worst			0
" " we 're all on pins and needles , " she said			0
her husband and some friends put sandbags around her property , and plan to take further action to protect it			1
her home flooded once before , she said , but only one room			0
" it ruined my carpet , " she said			0
in @entity238 , " our biggest concern is @entity237 , " said parish president @entity234			1
the prison , officially the @entity237 , is protected by a levee system , he said			0
" a lot of those inmates have been moved out of the prison to other facilities , and that is going to continue until they get to a number they can house on higher ground with no problem			0
" before 2005 's @entity34 , the @entity72 metropolitan area saw significant flooding in may 1995 , when 24 inches of rain fell in some neighborhoods , said forecaster @entity255 of the @entity256			0
if the @entity68 is not opened , @entity84 's high water will crest may 25 at about 9.5 feet , said @entity255			1
that level will be 12 to 13 feet if the waterway is opened			1
levels in @entity83 will be 7.5 feet higher if the spillway plan is put into place			1
the increase will be more modest in @entity82 , @entity255 said			0
using sand baskets , @entity264 are raising a 5 - mile stretch of earthen levees on the lake side of @entity84 , said planning and zoning director @entity269			2
he expects the levees , which were fortified after the 1973 floods , to hold the water if the @entity68 is opened			1
still , the city does n't know exactly what to expect when the 140 - mile long @entity77 crests later this month			1
" we 're positive and worried at the same time , " @entity269 said .			0

500 @entity51 members mobilized
residents in low - lying areas have been put on alert
there is concern about a plan to open the @entity68
@entity68 has n't been opened since 1973
