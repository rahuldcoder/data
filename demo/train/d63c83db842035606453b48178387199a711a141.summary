the composition of the council had yet to be determined , he said , but the president of the council will be the interim president of the country until parliamentary and presidential elections are held			2

@entity1 's conflicts have ravaged its infrastructure and economy , leaving it among the poorest in the world			2
the nation 's first round of voting in a presidential election was held in march , and campaigning for the second round was about to begin			0
the election was prompted by the death of the incumbent @entity168 in january after a long illness			0
@entity168 had become president in september 2009 after the assassination of his predecessor			0
despite his coming to power in what international observers deemed a fair and peaceful election , his tenure was marked by turmoil among the country 's military and political leadership			0
