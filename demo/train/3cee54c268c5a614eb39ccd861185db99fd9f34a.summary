-- it may seem stunning that one of the most visited tourist attractions on the planet is a mall			2
attracting 75 million visitors a year , the @entity6 gets more foot traffic than the @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 combined			1
of course , the @entity6 is no ordinary shopping center			1
billed as the world 's largest ( in terms of total floor space ) by the @entity15 when it first opened in 2008 , the mall is larger than 50 football pitches			1
it houses 1,200 stores , an @entity21 - sized ice skating rink , an aquarium , the world 's largest shoe store , 14,000 parking spaces , and a @entity27 flight simulator			1
it was no small investment ; the entire complex cost $ 20 billion to build			1
" it 's a city within a city , " admits @entity30 , chairman of @entity31 , the development company responsible for building the mall			1
as one can imagine , running such an enterprise is challenging , and it takes a lot of man power			0
with 20,000 employees , the mall 's staff is equivalent to the size of a small army			1
" to make it work , you need to have a tremendous amount of people that are on the job 24 hours a day , " says @entity44 , ceo of the @entity45			0
though the mall closes at 10pm ( midnight on the weekends ) , in some ways it is busiest after hours , when a cleaning crew of 100 sweep , vacuum and polish over 1.5m square feet of space every night			0
" it 's a huge mall , " notes @entity61 , the night shift supervisor for cleaning			1
" we have to finish before the opening hour			0
sometimes we only have five or six hours to do it			0
it 's hard , but we like the challenge			2
" an even more arduous cleaning task sits just outside the malls doorstep			0
the @entity72 -- an 150m liter artificial body of water that also houses the @entity75 -- requires daily maintenance , partly because the desert climate itches to contaminate it with sand			0
" the job is to target the areas where we have the highest sand accumulation , and clean it in a systematic way , " says @entity80 , director of operations for the @entity75			0
in addition to the human staff , there are underwater robotic vacuums employed to undertake the task			2
despite the manpower that goes in to running the mall , @entity30 concedes that even more can be done to ensure it lives up to its full potential : " we 've tried really hard to make sure it 's prestigious , respected , looks after people , customers , companies , shareholders -- the whole thing			2
i think we 're getting there			0
we still have to work a little bit , but we 're getting there			0
