-- following a period of freak - out on the internet on monday , @entity1 appears to have pulled a controversial feature that let the social network 's users get a digital list of other @entity9 nearby			1
the " @entity11 " feature was not accessible in a @entity0 test on tuesday morning , and other media outlets , including @entity14 , reported that @entity1 had pulled the service			1
in a statement e-mailed to @entity0 , a @entity1 spokeswoman declined to elaborate			2
" this was n't a formal release -- this was something that a few engineers were testing , " the spokeswoman wrote			0
" with all tests , some get released as full products , others do n't			0
nothing more to say on this for now -- we 'll communicate to everyone when there is something to say			0
" when @entity1 users logged on to the @entity11 site , they were supposed to be able to see friends and other @entity1 users who were in close proximity			1
facebook users did not show up on those location - aware lists unless they intentionally logged into that site , which was accessible on monday at http://fb.com/ffn			1
the site came to the public 's attention on sunday after news of the feature was leaked to the tech press , according to news reports			2
a @entity1 engineer who claimed to have designed the feature said in a message to the blog @entity54 that it could be used to quickly look up and " friend " someone who you 'd met in person			1
" for me , the ideal use case for this product is the one where when you 're out with a group of people whom you 've recently met and want to stay in contact with , " that developer , @entity63 , wrote			0
" @entity1 search might be effective , or sharing your vanity addresses or business cards , but this tool provides a really easy way to exchange contact information with multiple people with minimal friction			2
" @entity63 wrote that he developed the app as part of a coding competition , or hackathon			0
" social discovery " apps like @entity81 and @entity82 , which @entity1 recently purchased , already perform similar functions and have not been hit with the same backlash @entity1 received			2
@entity1 says it was " testing " the feature and that it had not become a formal part of the site , despite the fact that it was available online on monday			1
the company had not promoted the feature			0
" we are constantly testing new features but have nothing more to share at this time , " a company spokeswoman told @entity0 in an e-mail on monday			0
the blog @entity100 dubbed the feature a " stalking app , " and news of @entity11 received a cold reception on the @entity105 , where @entity107 users and bloggers panned the idea -- saying @entity107 - y things like " @entity111 to the naw , " " oh lawd ! " and " bad facebook ! ! " furthermore , a company called @entity115 claimed monday that @entity1 had stolen its concept and was threatening the much - larger social network with a lawsuit			1
" i was amazed on sunday to read that @entity1 is blatantly stealing our idea with what they are calling , ' find @entity127 , ' " @entity115 ceo @entity119 said in a statement posted on @entity121 and on other tech news sites			0
what do you think of the idea of knowing which @entity1 users are nearby ? could this be useful for finding new friends and looking up new contacts ? or does it cross a line in terms of privacy ?			1

@entity1 pulls ' @entity11 ' feature
the feature , called a " stalking app " by one site , let @entity1 users see a list of people nearby
facebook users had to be logged in to the site to appear on the lists
internet users *blasted* the feature as an *invasion* of privacy
