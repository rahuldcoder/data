@entity10 , @entity6 's ex-wife and mother of his two oldest children , has not publicly revealed whether she will challenge @entity19 , his 79 - year - old mother , for custody or visitation rights			1
@entity19 gained temporary guardianship of her son 's children soon after his death last month			1
the two women have been working to " privately and amicably resolve " the matter since @entity6 's death , a @entity6 family lawyer said			1
@entity10 's lawyer said this week that she was not asking the @entity31 for more money in exchange for dropping a possible custody challenge			1
a close friend of @entity10 said she has been grieving @entity6 's death -- grief made more painful by paparazzi hounding her and media reports vilifying @entity10 by depicting her as a heartless woman who would trade her kids for cash			1
" @entity10 's a very caring , wonderful , warm person , " said @entity42 , who met first met @entity10 when he worked for @entity6			1
" she 's a very humble person			2
people , you know , do n't give her credit that she was a friend of @entity6 's for over 30 years			1
" @entity6 and @entity10 met when she was working as a nursing assistant in the @entity48 office of @entity6 's dermatologist , dr. @entity49			1
@entity10 said in a 2003 interview , later obtained by @entity51 , that she became closer to @entity6 in 1996 when she consoled him after his brief marriage to @entity53 ended			1
" he was upset because he really wanted to be a dad , " @entity10 said			1
" i said , ' so , be a dad			2
' he looked at me puzzled			0

' let me do this			0
i want to do this			0
you have been so good to me			0
you are such a great friend			2
please let me do this			0

' " she told the interviewer they married in 1996 only to " prevent some of the taboo of a child out of wedlock			2
" while @entity42 would not say if their relationship was sexual , he said @entity10 had " a true , true love there for @entity6			1
" their first child , @entity71 , was born in february 1997			0
a daughter , @entity75 - @entity74 , was born the next year			0
details of how the children were conceived and who was the biological father have been closely guarded amid much public speculation			0
the couple divorced in 1999 with @entity10 giving @entity6 full custody while she got a $ 8.5 million settlement , according to court documents			1
@entity6 later agreed to additional support			1
@entity10 gave up parental rights to @entity6 in 2001 , but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children			1
a @entity1 appeals court later ruled her rights were improperly terminated , opening the door to a possible custody battle			1
@entity10 claimed in the 2003 interview that she still had " some influence " over how @entity6 raised the children , citing his practice of covering their faces in public as her idea			1
" that was my request , not his , " she said			0
" i am the one who 's terrified			2
i am the one who 's seen the notes that someone 's going to take his children , " she said			2
she said the children do n't call her " mom " because she did not want them to			0
" it 's not that they 're not my children , but i had them because i wanted him to be a father , " she said			1
@entity10 , 50 , lives on a farm in @entity114 , @entity1 , about 60 miles north of @entity0 , where she breeds horses and dogs			1
" she spends time with all of her horses and her dogs , " @entity42 said			0
" if one of her horses is sick , @entity10 will stay up all night long caring for them			1
she 'll sleep on the floor in the barn with a horse if he 's not well			0
" @entity10 does n't run out to all of the social events , " he said			2
" you do n't see her shopping on @entity128			0
she 's not hitting the hot spots			0
she 's not trying to be in the limelight			0
@entity10 is just as happy at home in her very modest , humble , horse ranch			2
" when @entity134 's paparazzi surrounded her outside a restaurant near her ranch earlier this month , she showed flashes of anger and frustration			0
" are you ready to fight for your kids ? " a photographer repeatedly shouted			0

@entity42 said @entity10 wants privacy and she 's " just trying to go on with her life			1
" " she does n't react well with the paparazzi , " he said			0
@entity10 's lawyers have stepped up their efforts to bolster her public image by firing off warning letters and demanding retractions when they see reports they think are wrong			1
one letter sent tuesday demanded the @entity157 retract its report that @entity10 had agreed to drop her custody claims for $ 4 million			2
" ms. @entity10 has not accepted -- and will not accept -- any additional financial consideration beyond the spousal support she and @entity6 personally agreed to several years ago , " @entity160 said in the letter			1
" among the several contenders for overzealous and inaccurate sensationalism , the @entity157 has now seized top honors , " @entity160 wrote to the paper			0
" it would be easier to identify those few background facts that are accurate than to catalog the number of blatant falsehoods in your story			0
" " @entity175 stands by its story , " @entity157 editor - in - chief col @entity174 told @entity2			0
@entity10 also filed a lawsuit this week against a woman who claimed in a tv interview to have e-mails from @entity10 saying she did n't really want to raise the children			2
the suit asked that @entity10 be given any money paid to the woman for the interview			2
@entity2 's @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
