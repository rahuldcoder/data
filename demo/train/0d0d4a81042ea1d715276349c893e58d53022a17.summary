@entity1 intelligence officials are leaning toward the theory that " those in the cockpit " -- the pilots of @entity11 -- were responsible for the mysterious disappearance of the commercial jetliner , a @entity1 official with direct knowledge of the latest thinking told @entity12 on saturday			1
the revelation followed news that @entity16 authorities searched the home of the lead pilot , a move that came the same day that prime minister @entity20 told reporters the plane veered off course due to apparent deliberate action taken by somebody on board			1
the @entity16 government had been looking for a reason to search the home of the pilot and the co-pilot for several days			1
but it was only in the last 24 to 36 hours , when radar and satellite data came to light , that authorities believed they had sufficient reason to go through the residences , according to the @entity1 official , who spoke on condition of anonymity			1
" the @entity16 do n't do this lightly , " the official said			1
it 's not clear whether the @entity16 government believes one or both the men could be responsible for what happened when the @entity46 disappeared march 8 en route from @entity48 to @entity49			1
what we know about the cockpit crew the official emphasized no final conclusions have been drawn and all the internal intelligence discussions are based on preliminary assessments of what is known to date			1
other scenarios could still emerge			0
the notion of a hijacking has not been ruled out , the official said			1
a source close to the investigation told @entity12 that @entity16 police had searched the home of pilot @entity66 , 53			1
@entity66 lives in an upscale gated community in @entity68 , outside @entity16 's capital of @entity48			1
two vans were loaded with small bags , similar to shopping bags , at the home of the co-pilot , 27 - year - old @entity74 , according to a @entity12 crew who observed activities at the residence			1
it was unclear whether the bags were taken from the home , and police made no comment about their activities there			1
@entity20 made clear in a press conference that in light of the latest developments , authorities have refocused their investigation to the crew and passengers on board			0
undoubtedly , they will scour through the flight manifest and look further to see whether any of the passengers on board had flight training or connections to terror groups			0
a senior @entity1 law enforcement official told @entity12 that investigators are carefully reviewing the information so far collected on the pilots to determine whether there is something to indicate a plan or a motive			1
that would seem supported by preliminary @entity1 intelligence reports , which the @entity1 official said show the jetliner was in some form of controlled flight at a relatively stable altitude and path when it changed course and flew toward the @entity116			1
it is presumed by @entity1 officials to have crashed , perhaps after running out of fuel			0
' someone acting deliberately ' the first clue that perhaps one or both of the pilots were involved stem from when the plane made a sharp , deliberate turn from where it last communicated with @entity48 air traffic controllers , and before it would have to communicate with @entity130 controllers , according to the @entity1 official with knowledge of the latest intelligence thinking			1
" this is the perfect place to start to disappear , " the official said			1
military radar showed the jetliner flew in a westerly direction back over the @entity16 peninsula , @entity20 said			1
it is then believed to have either turned northwest toward the @entity141 or southwest elsewhere in the @entity116 , he said			0
" evidence is consistent with someone acting deliberately from inside the plane , " the prime minister said , officially confirming the plane 's disappearance was not caused by an accident			2
despite media reports that the plane was hijacked , we are investigating all major possibilities on what caused @entity11 to deviate			0
" the focus of the search is now in the southern @entity116			1
" the southern scenario seems more plausible , " the official said			2
meanwhile , according to @entity20 , new satellite information leads authorities to be fairly certain that someone disabled the @entity160 and @entity161 , or @entity162 , just before the aircraft reached the east coast of peninsular @entity16			1
" shortly afterward , near the border between @entity16 and @entity130 air traffic control , " @entity20 said , " the aircraft 's transponder was switched off			1
" @entity162 is the system that routinely transmits information like turbulence and fuel load back to the airline			0
a transponder is a system controlled from the cockpit that transmits data about the plane via radio signals to air traffic controllers			0
it combines with ground radar to provide air traffic controllers with details about the plane , including its identification , speed , position and altitude			0
the last voice communication from the cockpit a week ago were these words : " all right , good night			0
" they were uttered at the @entity130 air traffic control border at about the same time the transponder was shut off , @entity20 said			1
that suggests the incident on the plane began sooner than initially thought			0
but some have questioned the prime minister 's account , given the dearth of information available			2
@entity16 investigation criticized in the days since the flight disappeared , the @entity16 government has been under intense scrutiny for its handling of the investigation			1
the government has been criticized by some @entity1 officials for not sharing information or accepting more offers of help			2
shortly after @entity20 delivered his remarks , @entity212 demanded @entity16 provide more information on the investigation			1
of the 239 people aboard flight 370 , 154 were @entity212			0
" today is the 8th day of the missing @entity11 , and the plane is still yet to be found , " said a statement from the foreign ministry			0
" the criticism was more pointed in an editorial published by @entity212 's state - run news agency @entity224			2
" and due to the absence -- or at least lack -- of timely authoritative information , massive efforts have been squandered , and numerous rumors have been spawned , repeatedly racking the nerves of the awaiting families , " the editorial said			0
@entity16 authorities have been highly sensitive to any suggestion they ca n't handle the investigation , said the @entity1 law enforcement official , who also spoke on condition of anonymity			1
it took several days last week to calm their anger over inaccurate reports that the @entity244 had dispatched a team to investigate , the official said			2
@entity246 defended its actions , saying there has never been a case where information gleaned from satellite signals alone could potentially be used to find the location of a missing airliner			0
" given the nature of the situation and its extreme sensitivity , it was critical that the raw satellite signals were verified and analyzed by the relevant authorities so that their significance could be properly understood , " the airline said in a statement			0
" this naturally took some time , during which we were unable to publicly confirm their existence			0
" transcript : @entity16 prime minister 's statement on @entity11 @entity271 to @entity116 as the focus of the investigation shifted , so , too , has the focus of the search			1
information from international and @entity16 officials indicate that the jet may have flown for more than seven hours after the last contact with the pilots			1
@entity11 took off from @entity48 at 12:41 a.m. on march 8			0
the last satellite communication from the plane occurred at 8:11 a.m. , @entity20 said , well past the scheduled arrival time in @entity49			0
that last communication , @entity20 said , was in one of two possible traffic corridors shown on a map released to the press			0
a northern arc stretches from the border of @entity271 and @entity291 to northern @entity292 , and a southern arc spans from @entity294 to the southern @entity116			0
" due to the type of satellite data , we are unable to confirm the precise location of the plane when it last made contact with the satellite , " @entity20 said			0
because the northern parts of the traffic corridor include some tightly guarded airspace over @entity307 , @entity308 , and even some @entity1 installations in @entity310 , @entity1 authorities believe it more likely the aircraft crashed into waters outside of the reach of radar south of @entity307 , a @entity1 official told @entity12			2
if it had flown farther north , it 's likely it would have been detected by radar			2
nonetheless for the last 36 hours , the @entity1 military and intelligence community has been reviewing all satellite imagery and electronic data it collects from the region for any sign of an explosion or crash , according to another @entity1 official directly familiar with that effort			2
@entity20 said authorities were ending search operations in the @entity330 and reassessing the deployment of assets			2
" this new satellite information has a significant impact on the nature and scope of the search operation , " he said			2
investigators , he said , have confirmed by looking at the raw satellite data that the plane in question was the @entity246 jet			2
the same conclusion was reached by the @entity344 , the @entity345 , the @entity346 and the @entity16 authorities , all of whom were working separately with the same data , he said			1
families hold onto hope for the families and loved ones of those aboard flight 370 , saturday was day 8 of anguish			0
some found comfort that there is no evidence the plane made impact			0
the father of one passenger watched @entity20 's news conference at a @entity49 hotel			2
he said he hoped the plane was hijacked because that gave him reason to think his son was alive			2
" i hope they are alive , no matter how small the chance is , " he said			0
the search that began last weekend now involves 14 countries , 43 ships and 58 aircraft , @entity20 said , and that the relevant foreign embassies have been given access to the new information			2
@entity212 is sending technical experts to join the investigation , and two @entity212 search vessels headed for the @entity381 , according to @entity224			0
plane was taking ' strange path ' hours before @entity20 's announcement , @entity1 officials told @entity12 the flight had made drastic changes in altitude and direction after disappearing from civilian radar			0
@entity16 military radar showed the plane climbing to 45,000 feet -- which is above its approved altitude limit -- soon after disappearing from civilian radar screens and then dropping to 23,000 feet before climbing again , a @entity1 official familiar with the investigation said			1
the jetliner was flying " a strange path , " the official said on condition of anonymity			0
the details of the radar readings were first reported by @entity404 on friday .			0

area between @entity16 and @entity130 " perfect place to start to disappear , " official says
investigators have *renewed* their focus on the pilots , a law enforcement official says
@entity16 's government *wanted* a reason to search the pilots ' homes , the official says
police search homes of pilot and co-pilot
