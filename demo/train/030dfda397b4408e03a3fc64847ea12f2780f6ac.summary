the deal reached with the @entity1 late saturday in @entity2 represents a risk well worth taking by the @entity5 administration and the five other powers that negotiated it with the @entity1			1
if the @entity5 administration briefly got some first - term international diplomatic credit for the suggestion it would hit the " reset " button on relations with @entity15 , for this , its most important second - term initiative to date , it has opted for the " hold " button			1
the deal is an interim agreement by which @entity20 has consented to freeze efforts that could lead to the development of nuclear weapons in exchange for modest relief from international economic sanctions			1
now that an interim deal has been reached , the @entity1 can not move closer to a bomb as talks proceed			2
even skeptics who do n't trust @entity1 and fear it has been moving ever closer to gaining nuclear weapons capability must acknowledge that if this deal slows @entity1 down at all , it serves a useful purpose			1
if it does not , but intensive negotiations continue as a result of it , then we are at least no worse off than we were in the first place			0
@entity5 : @entity1 deal limits ability to create nuclear weapons further , if at the end of the ensuing negotiating phase no deal is reached , taking military action would be seen as more justified given that diplomatic options were exhausted			1
that said , this deal has other little - noted or discussed implications and dimensions at many levels beyond the letter of its terms			0
for example , despite @entity60 prime minister @entity59 's advance denunciations of the deal -- struck between @entity1 and a group of international powers led by the @entity65 -- he deserves as much credit for the deal as anyone else			1
his incessant banging on the drums of war led the world to believe that absent some diplomatic agreement soon , military action by the @entity60 or the @entity65 would be inevitable			0
the deal struck saturday in @entity2 was as much to freeze @entity60 's edging toward war as it was to freeze @entity1 's nuclear program			1
for @entity60 , despite its apprehensiveness about the arrangement , to strike @entity1 now would make it an international pariah			2
for the @entity5 administration , the deal offers multiple advantages			1
for the near term , at least , it is a rare diplomatic triumph			0
it arguably validates its program of sanctions by suggesting that the economic measures drove the @entity1 to the negotiating table			0
but in addition , it not only forces @entity59 to at least sit on his hands for awhile ; it avoids the awkward situation of having to choose between supporting @entity60 ( and inviting a major conflict in the region into which it would like be drawn ) and appearing weak on @entity1			2
for the @entity1 , the deal provides some relief from the hardships associated with the sanctions -- estimates run in excess of $ 10 billion and some suggest the impact might be multiples of that			1
( @entity110 , @entity15 and the @entity111 all also have been hoping for anything that might promise a restoration of economic ties with the oil - rich nation			0
) but the deal also gives @entity1 useful negotiating leverage as it seeks to influence the outcome in neighboring @entity120 , where the embattled @entity122 administration is an important ally			2
not only has it produced a more robust diplomatic dialogue with the @entity1 , but now that the six nations that are engaged in this deal have a stake in it producing a positive outcome , they are less likely to inflame the @entity1 or put them on the defensive with a @entity120 deal that is seen by them as a defeat			0
of course , the critical question will be whether the next phase of negotiations for which this deal clears the way will produce a real breakthrough , a verifiable program for dismantling those elements of @entity1 's nuclear program that might allow it to develop nuclear weapons			1
if it did , it would be a rarity , one of the few recent instances where diplomacy succeeded in stopping a nation that wanted nukes from getting or keeping them			0
but it would not address the myriad other areas in which @entity1 has been helped inglame the problems of the @entity153 during the past several decades			0
it would not impact its state sponsorship of terror			0
it would not impact its efforts to extend its influence via support for regimes and political actors -- from @entity120 to @entity161 to @entity162 to @entity163 ; indeed , as noted earlier , it might help them in this respect			0
and what 's more , if it gave the @entity65 a greater stake in a better relationship with @entity1 , it might also complicate relations with the @entity169 and the @entity60 who see @entity1 as a threat			2
what 's more , if the interim deal does not result in a longer term deal , what would happen next ? would war then be the only option ? more sanctions ? would the absence of military action in that case suggest it would never come ? the @entity2 deal is a genuine diplomatic step forward			2
if it delays or reduces the risk of @entity1 gaining nuclear weapons and triggering an arms race in the region , it will be even more than that			1
but it needs to be viewed with open eyes , with sensitivity to the risks it creates , those it does not address and to its many resonances and potential consequences .			0
