@entity0 -- @entity2 were making an election - year pitch to women on friday , mindful of their past advantage among the voting bloc and hoping to convince enough women to cast ballots for their candidates in november 's mid-term contests			1
without strong turnout and support from women , @entity2 stand little chance of keeping control of the @entity16 -- the party 's top priority this year			1
the biggest draw at the @entity2 ' women 's leadership forum in @entity0 was @entity21 , their leading 2016 potential presidential contender and , in the minds of some @entity2 , a potential boost to mid-term candidates			1
president @entity25 and vice president @entity26 also were on the event 's roster			1
" we have fought for families , for moms and dads and kids and the values that hold us all together , " @entity29 said during her midday speech , which was warmly received by the room of party activists			0
women have provided @entity2 a boost in recent elections , including in 2012 , when 55 % voted for @entity25 in that year 's presidential contest			1
but as @entity25 's poll numbers have slid , so , too , has his support among women			1
the most recent @entity1 survey of @entity25 's popularity showed 55 % of women disapproved of how @entity25 is handling his job -- the same percentage that voted for him in 2012			1
that disapproval rate was on par with the figure for men			0
on pressing issues including terrorism , the economy and @entity59 , more women than men disapprove of how @entity25 's doing his job			1
those figures worry @entity2 , whose prospects in this year 's contests are closely pinned to voters ' perception of @entity25			1
those anxieties have led to scant invites for @entity25 on the campaign trail			2
less worrisome in the mind of some party operatives is @entity29 , who 's been enlisted to stump for candidates in several states ahead of the november 4 vote			2
on friday , she said the congressional and gubernatorial contests were just as important as the higher - profile presidential race she 's currently considering			2
" i know they might not be as glamorous as presidential elections , " @entity29 said of midterms , but they 're nonetheless " crucial for our country 's future			2
" listing candidates such as gubernatorial hopefuls @entity89 ( @entity91 ) and @entity92 ( @entity93 ) , @entity29 said women candidates " give me hope " for the future of keeping issues like pay equity and the minimum wage at the fore			2
" we have fought for families , for moms and dads and kids and the values that hold us all together , " she said			0
" so do n't let anyone dismiss what you 're doing here today as women 's work			1
do n't let anyone send you back to the sidelines			0
" earlier , @entity26 touted his own record advocating for stricter laws to punish violence against women , and claimed modern - day @entity117 were n't upholding their party 's history			2
" it was n't democrats involved			0
republicans were the sponsors of raises in the minimum wage			0
i could go on and on			0
so i 'm not joking			0
this is not your father 's @entity117 , " he said			0
republicans countered by claiming @entity2 were only interested in " pointing fingers			0
" " every day we are talking to women about the issues we all care about -- empowering women at work and at home , creating good paying jobs , building the economy , increasing workplace flexibility , addressing workplace discrimination and modernizing job training , " said @entity117 spokeswoman @entity132 .			0
