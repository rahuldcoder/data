@entity0 , @entity1 -- the headlines and newscasts that report the events of the @entity6 to the world invariably focus on the stars of the tournament			1
from @entity11 ' record - breaking feats in the pool to @entity14 's bid to retain his 100m crown ; the column inches , air time and online attention remain fixed to the gold and the glory			1
but this is only the tip of the true @entity6 story			1
over two hundred nations have taken part in the modern @entity6 since 1896 , and of them 79 are yet to win a single medal			1
most athletes who have traveled thousands of miles across the world to @entity1 , and devoted years of their lives to train in a discipline of their passion , are outside bets to win a medal at best			2
and many , from the nations who have yet to claim a podium place , are looking to overturn a seemingly one - way current of history that keeps them -- or anyone else from their homeland -- from clutching a sacred circle of gold , silver or bronze			2
but it 's not just the @entity48 that burns eternally , the hope in the hearts of " the underdogs " burns too			1
underdogs like @entity53 , a 218 kg judokan from the small @entity56 island - nation of @entity57			1
to remark purely on the 25 - year - old 's size would be a glib oversight of the olympian he is			2
inspired by the judo exploits of his father , @entity53 , who became @entity57 's first olympian in 1988 , @entity53 has been a judo player since the age of five			1
he " trains hard , four - to - six hours every day " and studied at a judo college in @entity69 before qualifying for @entity70 and then @entity1			0
" in all bar two olympics since 1988 , we 've always had a representative from @entity57 in the judo , and they 've usually been from my family : my @entity78 , my first cousins and now i hope to keep that going , " he told @entity2			1
" i was on the judo mat before i could walk , i 've never known anything else			0
i got into it and then it 's like ' if you 're going to do something then take it all the way ' , and here i am at the @entity6			1
" no hubris , no hyperbole just honest joy at living his dream			0
@entity92 is one of eight athletes who qualified from a nation that barely covers 200 square miles and has a population of just 180 , 000 ( figures from the @entity97 )			0
and @entity1 will live long in the memory because , unlike in @entity70 -- where @entity53 lost in two visits to the mat and exited the tournament -- here , he won his first round bout against @entity104 of @entity105			1

" it was a win , at the @entity6 of all places ! it was an amazing feeling and it was the first for @entity57 as well			1
i 'm happy about that , " he told @entity2 just after this victory			0
sadly , for his compatriots , the winning streak was short - lived , as defeat followed in the second round to @entity124 's @entity123			2
it all happened within the space of 45 minutes , but created memories that will no doubt last a lifetime			0
" a loss is always bad but i have no regrets because i fought my hardest , i left it all on the mat , so i feel ok			0
i always wish i could have done better and gone further , but that 's now my prep for the future			2
" it 's gratifying because it shows i 've grown since @entity70 so maybe i 'll continue to grow and get on that podium sometime			0
my dream will always be an @entity6 medal , and if i win one it will show everyone in @entity57 they can do it			1
" away from the judo hall that sits on the banks of @entity1 's docklands , in the more comfortable surroundings of the @entity147 two sprinters from the @entity149 are contemplating the challenge that lies ahead			1
the @entity152 country of their birth is 164 square miles in size with a population of just over 56,000 ; a figure that means the entire nation could fit into the @entity159 in @entity1 with nearly a third of the arena left empty			0
it 's fair to say their community is tight			0
" it 's one of those places where everyone knows everyone			0
many people think we live in paradise , and it is pleasant , but i like how multicultural the place is too			0
i would n't change it for the world , " @entity175 told @entity2			2
@entity175 , 27 , is a 110m hurdler and one of seven athletes to have made the trip to the @entity181 capital from @entity149			1
his childhood friend and teammate is @entity184 , a 100m sprinter who aged 22 , and just a few weeks before the @entity185 , became the first @entity149 runner to complete his distance in under 10 seconds			1
" i was picked up at 13 by the national coach after running in an inter-school competition			0
and then i got serious at 15 because my brother made me jealous traveling to @entity191 to compete , so it all went from there really , " he told @entity2			0
both sprinters are now studying in @entity194 due to the their athletic talents but remain fixed on their nation 's goal ahead of their competitions in @entity1 : to win an elusive medal			1
" i feel like we 're going through a spell , our country is small but we now have five athletes of the a standard so i think there are medals coming , i 'm confident here or 2016 it will happen , " @entity184 said			2
by the time you read this @entity184 will be trying his best to qualify for the men 's 100m , arguably the most pressurized , high - intensity running race in the world			2
with the likes of @entity14 , @entity217 , @entity218 et al all vying for places too , he will be up against it			0
but despite the odds , and the size of the stage , @entity184 remains upbeat			2
" i get bubble guts and nervous but i 've done all the work to get here , i just need to finish it off			0
my time has come down from 10.7 to 9.9 , so i want to put my island on the map ( by continuing this )			0
" @entity236 ' first race comes on tuesday 7 , after the @entity234 fireworks of the weekend have settled			0
" it 's simple , keep away from the distractions and get from point a to point @entity240 as quick as possible , that 's it , period , that 's what i learned in @entity70			0
" both @entity236 and @entity184 plan to practice what they preach and bring home a medal at some point during their careers , but even without such tangible tokens of success surely @entity53 , and the @entity149 challengers represent what the @entity6 is all about : the challenge of taking part			1
baron @entity253 can rest easy that his legacy is alive and well ... complete coverage of the @entity6			2

gold medals and glory is only the tip of the true @entity6 story
it 's not just the @entity48 that burns eternally , but the hope in the hearts underdogs too
@entity53 became the first athlete from @entity57 to progress to an @entity6 second round
@entity175 and @entity184 are bidding to win first medal for the @entity149
