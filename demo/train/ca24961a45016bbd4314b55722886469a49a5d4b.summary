-- @entity1 are a very diverse people			1
although they share timeless universals that weave them together into a common fabric , it would be dishonest to paint them with a broad brush			2
a sophisticated and elegant civilization built over fourteen centuries stretching from @entity11 to @entity12 , it was brought to its knees in a crescendo of upheaval during the 30 - year period between the two world wars			2
the stabilizing institutions native to @entity21 society would never recover -- imported , @entity23 - style nationalist ideologies would seal their fate			1
amid this severe instability , no new post-industrial revolution thought could flourish and no space would be allowed for the intellectual framing of a contemporary yet " rooted " identity			2
making sense of the scattered pieces that remain would be a daunting task for even the best hearts and minds , let alone those who find themselves in the unenviable position of representing @entity1 communities across the continents they span			1
so it is with a great deal of deference to contributions and sacrifices offered up at precious price that i proceed to suggest that we have a problem			0
there is a vacuity in our leadership vision and the time has come for a change in course			0
community leaders both @entity56 and @entity57 have been unable to articulate a clear direction for @entity1 that illustrates a positive , authentic identity that is engaged as a participant in global society			1
for 10 years now , the discourse of @entity1 religious leadership has been limited to a single mantra			1
we continue to be reminded what @entity21 and @entity1 are not			1
not extreme , not violent			0
we seem to be constantly trying to convince our fellow @entity68 citizens and neighbors that @entity1 are no different than them -- nothing unique , nothing authentic , nothing remarkable			1
will the time ever arrive to talk about what @entity21 is and @entity1 are , as opposed to only what they are not ? can we not talk about what unique and authentic contributions @entity1 can bring to the global table ? there are many muslims throughout the world who would love to express how they , too , in their own unique way , are earning their keep in our great cosmopolitan societies			1
can we know how @entity21 informs and inspires these contributions ? current discourse from @entity1 leaders appears to acquiesce to the faulty premise that extreme and violent tendencies are rampant among the mainstream @entity1 population			1
while it is true that a minority fringe of individuals have allowed their political and human rights frustrations to carry them beyond the pale of @entity21 's normative teachings -- violating the very principles of the religion they invoke -- in so doing , their acts of terrorism can not justifiably be branded " @entity21			1
" what they are , then , is criminal			0
criminal in international law , criminal in shariah law			0
the vast majority of @entity1 have never accepted this behavior			1
not in the name of @entity21 , and not in any other name			1
the question remains , is there anything more to @entity21 and @entity1 than what they are not ? is there going to be a discourse that uplifts this silent and peaceful majority ; that paints a hopeful future of possibilities for them ? responsibility , accountability , and discipline form the bedrock of effective leadership			1
its substance , however , is vision and clarity about where the community needs to go and how they will constructively engage with the world around them			2
from here , communication becomes essential			0
but that articulation must be the product of listening , caring , and conversance with local contexts			0
one of the most important vocations of the leader is to empower those he or she leads to achieve the goals outlined in the vision			0
this entails a robust program for succession planning			0
all of this however , must be effectively grounded in fidelity to the universal principles of cultural and doctrinal continuity			0
though leaders are often benign and well intentioned , the problem is one of effectiveness			2
muslim leaders have been unable to articulate a vision for an effective way forward on behalf of their community			1
the situation is by no means hopeless ; the substance of restoration is ready to hand			0
however , it requires a modicum of honesty , far - sightedness , and resolve			0
any such vision will have to be at once grounded in the roots of @entity1 identity and positively engaged with the greater society			1
there has been , as of yet , no systematic deliberation or collective discussion across community boundaries and affiliations aimed at fleshing out viable solutions based on a thorough situation assessment			0
answers and solutions are arrived at haphazardly without significant reflection			0
this frequently leads to contradictions at a future point in time ; further contributing to the alienation of the @entity1 mainstream			2
one of the key causes contributing to such confusion is the conspicuous devolution of classical @entity21 institutions			2
the original institutions , native to @entity1 society -- whether religious or civil -- had always provided a balancing effect to the community , securing the integrity of self - understanding , memory , and praxis -- thereby facilitating balanced and responsible citizenship			1
the disequilibrium stemming from their neglect and decay is a direct contributor to the phenomenon of extremism			0
for decades , @entity1 elites have pursued a policy of disassociation from classical @entity21 institutions and sometimes even the religion itself			1
this has led to the neglect of core institutions causing them to fall into a state of disrepair			0
however , despite this , @entity1 elites have been unable to de-link themselves from the source of their identity as @entity1 -- the religion of @entity21 itself			1
it means the neglect and marginalization of native institutions inevitably comes back to haunt them			0
the absence of grounded authenticity has been a missing lynchpin to the success of solution - aspiring initiatives			0
it is imperative that new solutions demonstrate how they are grounded in the roots of the timeless world view of @entity21			1
this must be achieved in a way that is recognizable to the @entity1 mainstream or it will never gain traction amongst the grassroots			2
there persists a tendency to not allow psychological , moral , or intellectual space for new energy to emerge			0
along with the voice of emergent generations of @entity1 youth , non-arab and @entity244 @entity1 continue to be conspicuously absent or underrepresented in national and international leadership circles and events , even in @entity23 and the @entity247			2
there now exist whole generations of @entity1 who have come of age in an environment where modernity , technology , representative government , free speech , and even gender relations are familiar territory and not overwhelming or confounding phenomena			2
with the right credentials and given an opportunity , they are the natural candidates to negotiate the challenge of making sense of @entity21 in the current post-modern cosmopolitan context without sacrificing continuity of identity			1
to date , however , everyone is forced to wait around for the old leadership to continue playing catch up .			0

leaders in @entity273 unable to find way for @entity1 to show a positive identity , says @entity276
for past decade @entity1 have only talked about what they are not -- extremists and terrorists , he says
a new generation needs the chance to make sense of @entity21 in today 's globalized world
