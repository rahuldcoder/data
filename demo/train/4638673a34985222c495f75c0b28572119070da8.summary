most athlete 's best days are behind them by the time they reach their 30th birthday , but @entity6 is hoping that passing that landmark can trigger more success in his shooting career			1
having won a string of national titles in recent years , the @entity11 pistol marksman is now looking to transfer the success he 's enjoyed at home onto the international stage			1
time and statistics are on his side , he thinks			2
" i 'm 29 years old and the average age of the top 20 shooters in the world is about 34 or 35 so i 'm still not at my peak , " @entity6 told @entity1 's human to @entity23			1
raised in @entity28 , a southern suburb of capital @entity29 , @entity6 was encouraged to take up the sport by his father when he was a teenager			1
" i was 17 years old when i started shooting			1
my dad felt like i needed a hobby -- he 's a shooter himself -- so he took me to one practice and there was just no turning back from there			2
" initially , he would make the trip to the range once a week and it soon became clear that he had a natural flair for the sport			0
" i was getting decent results in @entity11			1
i was shooting better than men who had been shooting for 10 years or so			2
so then i wanted more and it just escalated very quickly and i do n't know , in four years , i think i was one of the best in @entity11			1
" now @entity11 's undisputed @entity47 , @entity6 competes in the 10 - meter air pistol and 50 - meter free pistol -- two of the 10 shooting events currently on the @entity53 program			1
" with the air pistol , the pellets are propelled by compressed air			0
the free pistol is a 0.22 caliber , " he explains			0
" i started with the 10m pistol -- that gives you the best foundation for all shooting events -- and then it just escalated			2
i got good at the air pistol and the free pistol is very similar and it improves the chances of getting to the @entity53 if you shoot in both			0
" the margins between success and failure are often fine in sport , but in competitive shooting they are perhaps at their finest , with millimeters the difference between joy and heartbreak			2
in the 10m pistol , the center of the target ( which scores a maximum 10 points ) is roughly the size of a one - cent coin , says the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) , while at 50m the bullseye is 50mm ( around two inches ) in diameter -- the same size as a small espresso cup			2
despite having to hold a job down at a local communications company , @entity85 manages to train six times a week , cramming in around five hours practice per day , on average			0
mental strength as the @entity11 's slight frame testifies , shooting is not so much about physical strength -- although it takes time to perfect holding a one - kilo gun steady , he says -- but mental training is absolutely key			1
" it 's physically demanding but not as much as most of the sports , but the mental strain is much more			2
you have to concentrate very deeply and you have to go into yourself somehow			0
it 's difficult to explain			0
it 's basically meditation , " he says			0
" you 're not really thinking about the shot , it 's just a feel			0
you 're just waiting for the right moment but you never decide to pull the trigger , it just goes and you just instantly know if it 's a good shot or not			0
" @entity6 is mostly happy honing his skills alone at his local shooting range -- a situation that suits his " introvert " character -- but he never passes up the opportunity to train with his peers either in person or online			1
" i go to @entity121 to training camps , so i get to train with the @entity121 national team and we have internet competitions like once a week			0
i shoot against a person in the @entity121 team and they 're very good so it 's always very challenging , " he says			0
" i love this constant demand to improve yourself and if something goes wrong , you can only blame yourself			0
" aiming for success @entity6 has enjoyed unparalleled national success in recent years winning eight national titles in a row and holds the @entity11 record in both his events			1
he has also shot his way to three gold medals and a silver at the @entity155 -- a biennial competition where eight of the continents smaller nations ( @entity11 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 ) compete across 11 sporting disciplines			2
@entity11 is gearing up to host the 16th edition of the games later this year , but medal success on the bigger sporting stages has proved elusive thus far			1
he competed in the @entity163 , becoming @entity11 's first ever @entity53 pistol shooter , but failed to make the 10m final and finished eighth in the same event at the 2013 @entity167 championships			1
but with time on his side , @entity6 is quietly confident that he can hit the bullseye in the years ahead			1
" my plan for the future is definitely to be one of the best			0
i know i can do it and i think i will ... i 'm pretty sure i will			0
