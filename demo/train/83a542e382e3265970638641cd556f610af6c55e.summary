-- former world no. 1 @entity1 produced her best form in almost two years to reach the semifinals of the @entity5 open on thursday , but hopes of an all - @entity8 last - four showdown ended when @entity9 suffered a humiliating defeat on the red clay			1
@entity1 literally had the tennis world at her feet after winning the @entity4 in 2008 , but she has since slumped to 58th in the rankings after a dismal past two seasons			0
however , the @entity16 now has the chance to reach her first @entity19 final since march 2009 after defeating 14th seed @entity21 6 - 2 7 - 5 to set up a clash with unseeded @entity24 @entity23			1
the 22 - year - old @entity1 had not won back - to - back matches since january , but began her @entity27 campaign with a win over @entity30 's @entity29 , then upset ninth seed @entity31 and registered her first - ever victory against @entity35 champion @entity34 on wednesday			2
if she can beat @entity23 , she will face a final against either world no. 1 @entity8 or the formerly top - ranked @entity37			1
" i think every player in one way or another goes through a tough time , and i think it is not how many times you fall but how many times you get back up , " @entity1 , who this year has been working with @entity39 's former coach @entity38 , told reporters			0
" this tournament and these victories that i have had this week mean a lot to me because i have put in so much work , not only in the last months but also the last year and it was just not happening			0
now i am just so happy to be back on track			0
" @entity37 , who unlike her compatriot @entity1 has never won a @entity53 tournament , is also enjoying a career resurgence			2
the seventh seed followed up her demolition of no. 11 @entity57 by crushing @entity59 6 - 0 6 - 1 in thursday 's late match , inflicting the fourth seed 's worst defeat of her distinguished career			1
the 25 - year - old @entity37 won at @entity64 in march and then reached the quarterfinals at another @entity67 event in @entity68 and also in @entity69 , @entity70			0
@entity8 , playing her first tournament since winning the year 's opening @entity53 , the @entity73 in late january , had her easiest win of the week as she dispatched @entity30 's @entity75 6 - 1 6 - 4			2
the @entity67 , who lost in her first match last year , won 10 of the first 11 games before a series of errors let world no. 37 @entity75 back into the match			0
@entity23 , who knocked out world no. 2 @entity83 on wednesday , progressed into the last four by defeating unseeded @entity85 @entity86 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 ) 6 - 4 .			1

former world no. 1 @entity1 reaches the semifinals of the @entity5 open
@entity16 , in her best form in almost two years , next plays @entity23
