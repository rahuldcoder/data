-- the @entity2 military has suspended a soldier who was filmed by @entity0 firing a rifle at @entity7 demonstrators during a deadly shooting incident on may 15 that resulted in the deaths of two @entity7 teenagers , an @entity2 military source told @entity0			1
the source , who asked not to be identified because of a continuing @entity2 investigation , said the soldier that was suspended worked for the military 's communications department and was not supposed to be shooting at all			1
" he 's not supposed to shoot things , " the military source told @entity0			1
" and that 's ultimately what he was doing , " the source said			2
" that 's why he was suspended until the investigation has been completed			2
" the @entity24 is standing by its assertion that @entity2 border police and soldiers only fired tear gas and rubber - coated projectiles during deadly clashes in the @entity32 village of @entity33 on may 15			1
security cameras caught the fatal shooting that day of two @entity7 teenagers in @entity33			1
according to six hours of raw , unedited video distributed by the children 's rights advocacy organization @entity40 and reviewed by @entity0 in its entirety , the two boys -- ages 17 and 16 -- were shot on the same patch of asphalt on the same day , the second victim 73 minutes after the first			2
at the exact moment when the first boy , @entity47 , was fatally wounded , @entity0 producer @entity45 was also filming the clashes			0
in the @entity0 video , it is not clear what kind of rounds the @entity2 were shooting , or whether their gunfire hit @entity47			1
however , @entity45 's camera shows that less than 15 seconds after one of these gunshots , @entity7 were already racing to put the fatally wounded @entity47 in the ambulance			1
@entity0 filmed two @entity2 security officers firing at the time of the incident			1
the first wore the black uniform and visored - helmet of a border police officer			0
the second wore the green uniform of the @entity24 , and appears to be the same man who was filmed earlier taking photographs with a still camera			2
seconds after he shoots his weapon , a border policeman takes the rifle from him			0
@entity0 was able to match events on the security video with events on @entity0 's own video			0
the @entity24 soldier is seen at other moments in the video aiming the rifle at the @entity7 protesters , appearing to be coached by a border police officer			1
@entity24 spokesmen and military experts tell @entity0 that both of the weapons fired in the video appear to be outfitted with an attachment used to shoot rubber - coated , metal projectiles			1
these " rubber bullets " are designed to wound , but not penetrate the bodies of the targets			1
according to a medical report , @entity47 was pronounced dead in a hospital , having suffered a single bullet wound that entered chest and passed out his back			0
doctors pronounced the other teenage victim , @entity98 , dead on arrival at the hospital , with a bullet wound that had pierced his back and exited out of his chest			0
during an interview last week , @entity47 's grieving father @entity103 showed @entity0 the bloody backpack that his son was filmed wearing at the moment he was shot			0
there was a small hole in the bag , at roughly the same location where the bullet would have exited from @entity47 's body			0
the elder @entity47 then pulled a packet of bloodstained papers out of the bag			0
they were photocopies of a text book that included the writings of @entity120 , accompanied by handwriting , doodles , and class notes			0
" we were surprised when we took the school backpack back from the hospital to find this bullet inside , " said the elder @entity47 , who then pulled out a small used bullet stored in a plastic bag out of the backpack			0
the metal slug appeared to be from a 556 @entity133 round , the standard ammunition used by @entity136 rifles carried by @entity2 security forces			2
it was impossible for @entity0 to confirm the authenticity of the bullet			0
@entity140 said he was saving it for a forensic examination			0
he accuses @entity2 soldiers of killing his son			2
the @entity2 human rights organization @entity143 , which investigates allegations of human rights abuses in the @entity32 , said the fatal shootings in @entity33 could not have been caused by rubber bullets			1
" we still think that these injuries could not have been sustained with any other weapons other than live ammunition , " said @entity148 , a @entity143 spokeswoman			0
though rubber bullets are sometimes known to be fatal , @entity148 said " there 's just no recorded incident ever of a rubber bullet killing two people from a range of about 70 meters , " referring to an estimate of the distance between the border police and the victims			1
however , @entity148 added that the @entity0 footage shows " border police firing something that looks very much like a rubber bullet			2
" the @entity167 has joined the @entity168 in calling for a swift and impartial investigation into the shootings			0
father blames @entity2 military in @entity7 teens ' deaths initial report : @entity7 teens fatally shot presented no threat			1
