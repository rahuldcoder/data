-- there 's never a bad time for a toga party , right ? the story of @entity5 -- the bastard son of @entity7 who takes on the mighty @entity8 -- will endure long after @entity10 's enjoyably cheesy movie has been forgotten ( or , inevitably , remade in @entity11 )			1
but for now , and for young men especially , @entity10 's version is the one that counts , and it will just have to do			0
it 's a mixed bag : three credited screenwriters have labored in the footsteps laid down by the 1981 @entity18 " classic " ( hardly his finest hour ) -- that is , they 've taken the myth as an excuse to showcase as many special effects sequences as they can muster			1
that 's not a bad strategy when it 's clear from the laughably clumsy opening that they have n't a clue how the ancient @entity29 spoke to one another			0
the clunky dialogue is delivered in various shades of tone deaf @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 by the likes of @entity39 ( @entity5 ) , @entity40 ( as his spiritual guru / love interest ) and @entity42 ( @entity7 )			1
@entity42 's old " @entity44 " nemesis @entity43 brings @entity45 to @entity7 's brother @entity46 , while the great , growly , scene - stealing @entity47 ( @entity48 in " @entity49 " ) makes the strongest impression among the mortals			1
@entity47 's only serious competition in the scenery - chewing stakes comes from the @entity8 itself , a toothy sea monster who is built up for an hour and three quarters , then comes on for five minutes -- wisely does n't say a word -- and walks away with the picture			1
in @entity18 's day , effects meant stop - motion photography of artfully modeled monsters , including a three - headed dog ( excised here ) and a golden mechanical owl ( who makes a cameo appearance for old time 's sake )			2
today 's @entity71 creatures may not have the same charm , but they 're considerably more agile and fluid , and the action scenes have tremendous dynamism			0
@entity10 comes from " @entity75 " and " @entity76 , " and he 's evidently more comfortable running than walking			0
a showdown with gigantic angry scorpions is the movie 's first big set - piece , and it 's exciting enough to make you forget you 've seen these critters before -- or something very similar , in " transformers			2
" the three @entity86 are ghastly , touchy - feely crones with one eye between them , and @entity90 is a giant snake who slithers around her lair like a heat - seeking missile - though i preferred the aplomb @entity97 brought to the role in " the @entity99			2
" like his namesake @entity100 , @entity5 has daddy issues -- he 's a demi - god who wants to prove he 's all man			1
after " avatar " and " @entity103 " @entity39 has cast - iron credentials on that score			1
we can see why @entity5 would resist invitations to join the @entity108			2
@entity109 looks like a colossal bore , a resting home for eternity			0
you wonder what they find to talk about all day			0
at least on @entity117 there are monsters to mash and quests to be quested			0
@entity121 : critic says " avoid at any cost " if it 's bad enough to be good in places , there 's no excuse for the film 's abominable retro - fitted @entity128 , a process that perversely flattens out the images into two planes , foreground and background , and renders this one of the ugliest epics in history			1
it 's a shame to see filmmakers jumping on a bandwagon like this , and missing			0
you 'd be well advised to seek out the picture 's 2d venues -- or wait for the dvd .			0

@entity39 plays the role of @entity5 in " @entity145 . "
