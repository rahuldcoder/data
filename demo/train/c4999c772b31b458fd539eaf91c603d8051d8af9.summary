-- while most people can appreciate the grace and athleticism of ballet , dressage -- the precision art of horse riding and training -- remains a puzzling spectacle to all but a few			1
a new performance by the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) aims to show that these two art forms are not so different			1
for the launch of the flagship @entity11 @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 the organizing body assembled the finest talent from the worlds of elite riding and ballet to show off their skills @entity23			1
" they 're very similar in terms of athletic ability ; they 're very delicate but they 're very powerful , " said @entity25 rider @entity24 , who joined dressage champion @entity26 and dancers from the @entity29 for the photoshoot			1
double @entity36 gold medalist @entity26 was just as impressed with her partnership with @entity39 maestro @entity38 -- calling it an " exciting " prelude to the competition in which she once again shattered world records			0
the @entity11 's director of dressage , @entity44 , says the organizers hoped to create a comparison to ballet which would open up the esoteric world to outsiders			1
he believes the parallels go beyond the athletes ' physical abilities			0
" you see a number of different elements in there			0
you need elegance , " he said			2
" you need a feeling for what you 're doing : it 's not only a question of jumping as far as you can or as long as you can or as high as you can -- it 's this combination of putting all these elements together to produce the optimal performance			2
" he was pleased with how much the riders got out of the day			0
he called @entity26 " a full - blown artist herself " but says seeing her perform alongside @entity38 highlighted the virtuosos ' similarities			2
the real test , he says , is to close your eyes and listen to the music			0
in either sport , you can imagine how the performer ( or performer plus horse ) could glide across the space			0
@entity26 , the @entity81 number one @entity79 rider , who took the dressage crown in @entity15 , has been labeled " the girl with the dancing horse , " but was enthused to see her horse-less dancing counterparts in action			2
the evening after the photoshoot , organizers @entity11 took the riders to see the dancers on their own turf -- at the @entity91 where the @entity92 performed @entity93 as part of a nationwide @entity16 tour			1
@entity44 says @entity26 told him she saw dance with " new eyes			0
" he now has high hopes for developing the cross-cultural collaboration further in future			1
" @entity102 is certainly more well known around the world than dressage riding , so if we can facilitate an understanding from people about our sport , through the similarities with ballet , then we 're very happy about that			1
