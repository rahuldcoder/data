-- @entity2 's president renewed calls for rebels to release a @entity6 journalist " as soon as possible " monday as online statements purportedly from leftist guerrillas provided details about his capture			1
" i am very pleased to know that the @entity6 journalist is in good condition			0
now that the ( @entity13 ) have acknowledged that they have him , i call for them to release him as soon as possible , " president @entity12 said			0
he said @entity2 officials will do whatever they can to guarantee journalist @entity18 ' release by the rebel group , commonly known as the @entity13			1
" the @entity2 government is willing to provide all the facilities so the release occurs as quickly as possible , but if you really want to be viewed well by the world , release him now and simply tell us where he is and we will go get him , " @entity12 said during a state visit to @entity21			1
@entity18 , who works for the @entity30 24 television network and is a war reporter with more than 10 years experience in the country , was reporting alongside soldiers when the rebel group attacked on april 28 , the @entity2 government has said			1
the attack took place in the southern @entity38 province as soldiers worked to destroy cocaine labs			0
the @entity2 president 's comments monday came as several apparent statements from the rebel group surfaced online			1
one statement , dated may 3 and published sunday on a blog connected with a news agency that often publishes official statements from the @entity13 , criticized @entity18 for wearing a military uniform and claimed that any journalists embedded with @entity2 troops have been painting a biased picture			1
" @entity18 was wearing a military uniform of the @entity53 in the middle of a fight			1
we think that the least that should be expected for the recuperation of his free mobility is the opening of a broad national and international debate about freedom of information , " said the statement , which the new @entity2 @entity57 described as an official press release from the @entity13			1
the @entity2 government and military officials have said that @entity18 was not wearing a full military uniform , but was wearing a helmet and a protective vest			1
in a @entity76 video posted over the weekend , a man in military fatigues claiming to be a local @entity13 commander described @entity18 as a " prisoner of war " and also said @entity18 had been " uniformed as a soldier and captured in plain combat			1
" in that statement , the purported @entity13 commander said @entity18 was " lightly wounded in one arm			2
he has been given the necessary medical attention and is out of danger			0
" another comment posted on @entity86 and purporting to be from the rebel group said @entity18 would be released soon " safe and sound			1
" @entity0 could not independently confirm that the statements came from the @entity13 rebels , whose official website is no longer accessible			2
the leftist guerrillas have been at war with the @entity2 government since the 1960s , and are known for holding prisoners and hostages in remote jungle camps			2
the statement in the @entity76 video appeared to echo a statement that a woman claiming to belong to the @entity13 read to a group of local journalists last week			0
@entity104 , an international press freedom group , cited the @entity86 comment in a statement monday , saying it was " cautiously confident that he will be freed very soon			1
" " it is absurd that the guerrillas consider him a combatant and in the same sense a prisoner of war			0
what a combatant does is armed , and @entity18 never had a weapon in this circumstance , and for that very reason holding him is absurd , " said @entity114 , director of the @entity116 - based @entity115			2
@entity30 24 reported last month that its editors were working with authorities in @entity2 and @entity30 to gather information on the journalist			2
" we know that it 's a difficult region , " said @entity127 , editorial director of @entity30 , of which @entity30 24 is a part , the television network reported			0
" of course we are very worried , but we have every confidence in @entity18 , who knows the territory very well and is an experienced journalist			2
we hope that he is safe and sound , and we are in constant contact with his family			0
" kidnapping government forces and civilians has been a key strategy of the rebel group			0
dramatic rescues , escapes and hostage handovers have revealed harsh conditions in jungle camps , including stories of prisoners chained to trees , grueling marches between hideouts , torrential rain and blistering sun. while severely weakened in recent years , the rebels have continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces			2
last month , the @entity13 released a group of 10 members of the military and police that it said were its last government hostages			0
in february , the @entity13 also said it would stop kidnapping civilians for money			0
the rebels did not address the fate of its civilian captives then , nor did it renounce kidnapping for political purposes			0
@entity0 's @entity166 and @entity167 in @entity168 and journalist @entity169 in @entity116 contributed to this report .			0

officials say @entity18 has been missing since an april 28 rebel attack
@entity2 's president calls on rebels to free the reporter " and simply tell us where he is "
several statements surface online *discussing* his capture , purportedly from the rebels
@entity104 says it is " cautiously confident that he will be freed very soon "
