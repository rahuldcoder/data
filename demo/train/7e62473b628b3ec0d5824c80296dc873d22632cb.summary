-- the @entity1 confirms that @entity2 has crossed a " red line " by using chemical weapons in its war with rebel forces , prompting the @entity7 to boost the " scale and scope " of its support for the opposition			1
the determination , disputed by @entity2 , comes as forces loyal to @entity2 president @entity16 have made gains in the past few weeks			0
also , the militant group @entity18 has become more active in the fighting on behalf of the regime			0
the opposition has warned it could face crippling losses without immediate support			1
what 's next ? the @entity26 administration was resisting calls to arm the rebels , worried in part about the influence of radical groups and that weaponry might wind up in the wrong hands			0
but it has now changed course			0
it is going to provide military support including small arms , ammunition and potentially anti-tank weapons to the rebels , according to two officials familiar with the matter			1
the weapons will be provided by the @entity44 , the officials said			1
the @entity1 said earlier said no decision had been made on whether to impose a " no - fly " zone			1
that is something rebels have said is needed to halt air attacks on their strongholds			0
the @entity7 has also ruled out sending troops , or putting " boots on the ground " in @entity2			1
what 's been the @entity7 response ? the @entity26 administration had previously authorized non-lethal assistance , including communications equipment , medical supplies and food			1
the first direct @entity7 support arrived in march			1
@entity26 signed off on a new package of non-lethal aid april			0
that assistance was expected to include body armor , night - vision goggles and other military equipment			1
defense secretary @entity68 also ordered the deployment of up to 200 additional @entity7 troops to @entity71 in april as the violence spreads from adjacent @entity2			1
those forces included communications and intelligence specialists aimed at assisting the @entity71 and " be ready for military action " if @entity26 were to order it , a @entity74 official said			0
a number of @entity7 special forces troops have been in @entity71 for the past year assisting that nation 's the @entity71			1
@entity71 is a crucial @entity7 ally in the @entity83 and has experienced an influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees from the fighting in @entity2			2
the @entity7 is also deploying a @entity88 anti-missile battery and f - 16 aircraft to @entity71 as part of military exercises taking place this month			1
it is not clear whether any of those assets will remain in @entity71 once the regional exercises are complete			0
the @entity2 possess scud missiles			0
the @entity7 also has deployed @entity88 missiles to @entity98 , which also borders @entity2			2
officials say those missiles are defensive in nature			0
would @entity103 join the @entity7 ? questions still remain about whether @entity103 would assist the @entity7 militarily , similar to its help in enforcing a " no - fly " zone over @entity107 during that country 's period of civil unrest			1
in the past , @entity103 has flatly ruled out military intervention and the @entity7 has no plans to put boots on the ground			1
but on friday , @entity103 secretary general @entity115 said the international community had made clear that any use of chemical weapons is " completely unacceptable and a clear breach of international law			0
" speaking in @entity121 , he said he welcomed " the clear @entity7 statement " on @entity2 's alleged chemical weapons use and that it was a matter of great concern			2
" as for @entity103 , the @entity88 deployment will ensure effective protection for @entity98 against any missile attack , whether the missiles carry chemical weapons or not , " he said			0
additional military options ? â € ¢ targeting @entity2 's air defenses with @entity88 missile batteries in @entity98 as part of a " no - fly " response , @entity103 has said			1
but @entity98 only allowed the missiles there for defensive purposes and @entity103 nations would have to agree before they could be used otherwise			0
â € ¢ @entity140 : the @entity7 military has enough air power in the region to take action against @entity2 , according to officials			2
that includes fighter jets and bombers spread out across air bases in the @entity83 and nearby aircraft carriers			0
the @entity151 also has warships equipped with @entity154 missiles , which could be used to hit chemical weapons supplies			0
but such strikes pose a danger of releasing chemical agents into the air around civilian populations in @entity2 , @entity7 officials told @entity0 in march			2
complicating military involvement what complicates any @entity7 military support for the opposition is that many of the rebel fighters are militants with pro-al @entity169 sympathies , the same stripe of militants @entity7 has battled in @entity172 and @entity173			1
in april , @entity174 cautioned lawmakers on the @entity176 about the difficulties surrounding any direct @entity7 military action in @entity2			2
" it could embroil the @entity7 in a significant , lengthy and uncertain military commitment , " he said			2
he called military intervention " an option but an option of last resort			0
" @entity187 chairman gen. @entity186 said the @entity7 could send troops to @entity2 if @entity16 's government fell , if needed , to secure chemical weapons			2
@entity0 's @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 contributed to this report .			0
