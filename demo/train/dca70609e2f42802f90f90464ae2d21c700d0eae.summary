president @entity0 joined the call for calm with word a @entity5 grand jury considering whether to indict officer @entity6 in the death of @entity8 was close to making a decision			1
" this is a country that allows everybody to express their views			2
allows them to peacefully assemble , to protest actions that they think are unjust , " the president told @entity15 in an interview excerpt broadcast on friday			2
" but using any event as an excuse for violence is contrary to rule of law and contrary to who we are			1
" the president 's comments came as the grand jury considers whether to bring charges against @entity6 , who is in the final stages of negotiations with @entity36 city officials to resign , sources close to the talks told @entity37			1
@entity6 has maintained he 's done nothing wrong , and the resignation talks have hinged on whether he is indicted , the sources said			2
while @entity6 has told associates he would resign to help ease pressure and protect his fellow officers , he has expressed concern about resigning while the grand jury was still hearing evidence for fear it would appear he was admitting fault			2
what charges could officer @entity6 face ? the talks could still collapse , the sources close to the talks said			2
@entity6 does n't know what the grand jury will do and , if they opt to charge him , he could change his mind			2
@entity6 , who has six years on the force with no disciplinary issues on his record , is currently on paid administrative leave			0
if he returns to duty , he will have to undergo two psychological evaluations , authorities have said			0
what is known , what is not the basic facts of the case -- @entity6 , a white police officer , fatally shot @entity8 , a black 18 - year - old who was unarmed , on august 9 -- are not in dispute			1
most everything else about the case is , leading to emotionally and racially charged divisions about what should happen next			0
the officer 's supporters have claimed @entity6 fired only in self - defense , pointing to witness testimony and leaked grand jury documents that suggest @entity8 might have attacked @entity6 , struggled for his gun and perhaps charged the officer moments later			1
@entity8 's backers have been likewise adamant in blaming @entity6 , claiming the officer shot a young man who , according to some accounts , was holding up his hands in surrender			1
this dispute as to what happened at that crucial moment , the handing of the investigation from the outset and the fact that charges were not brought against @entity6 sparked days of protests on the streets of @entity36			1
the ensuing police response , which many have called heavy - handed , and the violence , property damage and looting of some during the protests only deepened the sense of mistrust			1
dueling narratives in @entity8 shooting : who says what police : 3 more arrested in @entity36 once the grand jury decision is made , prosecutors are expected to provide law enforcement with 48 hours notice before making a public announcement			1
the current plans could still change and prosecutors could shift the planned grand jury session			0
