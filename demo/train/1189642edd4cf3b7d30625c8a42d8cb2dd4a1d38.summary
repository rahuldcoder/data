-- @entity1 demands perfection of himself and his caddy on the golf course , so when @entity0 presenter @entity5 was given the chance to carry the world no. 1 's bag for a few holes , he knew the learning curve would be steep			1
@entity1 reached the top of the rankings earlier this year by winning the @entity12 at @entity13 -- despite the best efforts of @entity5 to derail his effort in a practice round for the @entity18 's prestige event			1
@entity1 's regular caddy @entity19 was on hand to give some useful tips , but it appeared wasted on the @entity24 host			1
donning a fetching pair of shorts and the obligatory caddy 's bib , @entity5 hardly made the best impression on their first hole , the 15th at @entity13 , when he marched down the fairway without a key item			1
" you will need the clubs , that 's the first thing ! " said @entity19 , @entity1 's caddy since the @entity35 parted company with his brother @entity37 , who had previously carried his bag throughout his professional career			1
" it was affecting our relationship , " @entity1 told @entity5			2
" i 'd rather have him as a brother than a caddy			0
" under @entity19 , @entity1 has flourished , rediscovering the form that had taken him into the top 10 after victory in the 2006 @entity50 and becoming a regular in the @entity53 team			1
victory at the 2011 @entity55 in february put him on the brink of the no. 1 spot going into may 's @entity13 event			0
despite his easy - going reputation , @entity1 's patience was clearly tested again by the enthusiastic if not exact @entity5 -- who next managed to leave behind another piece of golf apparel , the towel to wipe the clubs			1
his yardage advice also fell short of expectations when @entity1 hit an approach into a bunker , but saved his par with a superb up and down from the sand			0
a relieved @entity5 thanked his " boss " for saving his bacon as he showed just why he was about to take over from @entity72 at the top of the rankings -- his superb recovery play			2
@entity1 said he had made the big mistake of thinking " i needed to hit it further " to get to number one , and that it affected his swing and his form			0
" it has taken me three or three years to get back to my best , " he added			0
but a rare error off the tee at the par - five 18th at @entity13 left @entity1 in the trees until he brilliantly engineered another miraculous recovery			2
turning to @entity5 for club selection , he looked a little surprised when the @entity88 pulled out a three - wood and encouraged him to have a tilt at the water - protected green			0
despite a good connection , the ball found a watery grave			0
" you should have told me to lay up short , " was @entity1 's assessment			2
" he 's one of the best players in the world at getting up and down from off the green , " chipped in @entity19			0
" he would have salvaged par. " suitably chastened , @entity5 's first tilt as a " professional " caddy had ended in the golfing equivalent of a red card ! fortunately , @entity19 had taken back the bag a few days later when @entity1 beat @entity72 in a playoff to win the @entity12 and become world number one for the first time			1
by then @entity5 was back to doing what he does best , presenting @entity24 .			0

@entity24 presenter @entity5 tries his hand as @entity1 's caddy
the @entity88 discovers the pitfalls of the *job* in a few holes at @entity13
later that week @entity1 takes over as world number one from @entity72
@entity1 's regular caddy @entity19 succeeded golfer 's brother in carrying his bag
