" we do n't know who took it or who uploaded it , but we do know it has news value			2
this award celebrates the fact that , in today 's world , a brave bystander with a cellphone camera can use video - sharing and social networking sites to deliver news			1
" the @entity40 : @entity31 winners include anonymous video uploader @entity69 : 2009 winners @entity0 : @entity1 was ' like an angel , ' mother says @entity73 : when president @entity75 and first lady @entity76 arrived at @entity77 on november 22 , 1963 , there were as many as 100 photographers there , mostly shooting black and white film			1
on monday , the @entity80 at @entity81 in @entity77 released never - before - seen , 8 mm amateur color film taken by @entity73			1
according to a release by museum curator @entity85 , @entity73 was 15 at the time of the assassination , and because students were given the day off for the president 's visit , he took his camera to @entity77 to watch the arrival of @entity93			1
" my dad operated a furniture store adjacent to the airport , and so that morning on his way to work , he dropped me off at the airport to see [ president @entity75 ] come in , " @entity73 said , according to the museum release			1

she funded her " 50 in @entity129 " by draining her 401k -- the entire $ 31,000 -- and then asking others for donations			2
her goal was to collect the stories of ordinary @entity132 who were making a difference in their local communities and to share those stories on her web site			1
she ultimately interviewed more than 500 people , blogged regularly and posted 370 videos			2
in january , she launched the @entity140 , telling @entity0 on monday , " one main thing i heard while traveling was , if they did n't have someone to push them or mentor them or train them , they would n't have been able to put their idea into action			2
" so after her journey , @entity116 decided to help people get their ideas off the couch and put them into action			0
her plan is to bring people from every state facing similar challenges to @entity120 and give them training on how to solve those problems			0
@entity116 said , " no matter where i went , i met people who were the same as the pioneers who built this country			0
they not only had to build their barns and plant their fields , they had to help their neighbors do the same			0
the people i met had the same values as those pioneers			0
" 50 in 52 @entity129 web site the @entity176 : woman travels nation , documents people making life better @entity181 : tuesday is the " @entity181 's " birthday , but where , do you ask , was he born in 1942 ? his official biography declares it was at the foothills of @entity187 , @entity189 's sacred mountain , amid bright lights and double rainbows			1
but historians are pretty sure he was born at a guerrilla base under @entity196 protection in the @entity196			0
the discrepancy should not surprise			0
when @entity205 's @entity204 wrote about the supreme leader of the @entity189 , the profile began , " an easy way of summing up @entity181 's life in one sentence would be to throw in the words reportedly , allegedly and the occasional is said to			1
" his father , @entity207 , founded @entity189 , and his son ran the country more or less for 20 years as his father aged , taking power officially in 1997 , a few years after his father 's death			1

" he 's 5 - foot - 2 and wears 4 - inch lifts in his shoes			1
" @entity176 , in his book " leaders and their followers in a @entity228 , " writes that @entity181 also loved to drink a certain @entity230 cognac that sold for $ 630 a bottle in @entity189			0
@entity230 , the maker of @entity234 cognac , confirmed that @entity181 was the biggest buyer of the cognac , and between 1988 and 1998 , maintained an estimated annual account of $ 650,000 to $ 800,000			0
@entity176 wrote the ruler " annually spent 770 times the income of the average @entity189 citizen ( $ 1,038 ) on cognac alone ! " @entity215 told @entity0 that @entity181 once kidnapped the most prominent @entity243 movie star and kept her under house arrest with her husband for eight years			0
and he has a collection of some 20,000 videotapes , including the complete @entity249 movie collection			0
in august 2008 , @entity181 had a stroke and was out of view for some time , and now seems to have recovered			0
@entity176 said he believes that some of his toughness on @entity189 nuclear policy now may be the indication of a power struggle at the end of his rule			0
@entity0 : @entity189 marks @entity181 's birthday @entity0 : mystery has surrounded @entity181 time : two - minute bio : @entity181 @entity262 : @entity264 anchor @entity263 said this weekend that the word " redemption " may be the most overused clich√© in all of @entity269 coverage , but it pretty much describes @entity262 's downhill race monday			1
@entity271 and the @entity273 web site report that @entity262 , winner of 32 @entity275 races , won two silver medals in @entity277 , @entity278 , but none during any of his five races at the @entity281 in in @entity282 in 2006			1
then in may 2007 , @entity262 announced he was leaving the @entity273 to race independently , only to rejoin the team in 2009			0
monday in @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity262 won a bronze medal in the men 's @entity288 downhill , finishing behind @entity290 of @entity291 , who took silver , and gold medal winner @entity293 of @entity295			1
@entity262 missed the gold by nine one - hundredths of a second , but he now holds the @entity132 record for most medals in @entity301			1
according to his official biography , @entity262 was born in @entity303 in 1977 , was home - schooled until fourth grade and started skiing at 3			0
@entity273 : @entity262 bio @entity271 : @entity262 career highlights @entity0 : @entity269 coverage what makes a person intriguing ? there are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new , important or different			0
others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect			0
and there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news			0
some of these people do what we expect of them : they run for office , pass legislation , start a business , get hired or fired , commit a crime , make an arrest , get in accidents , hit a home run , overthrow a government , fight wars , sue an opponent , put out fires , prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses			0
they do make news , but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story			0
but every day , there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character , how they reached their decision , how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in			0
we hear about them and want to know more			0
what they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country			0
at times , there is even a mystery about them			0
what they have done may be unique , heroic , cowardly or ghastly , but they capture our imaginations			0
we want to know what makes them tick , why they believe what they do , and why they did what they did			0
