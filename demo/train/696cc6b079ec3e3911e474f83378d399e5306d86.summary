@entity0 -- for a second consecutive year , no leader has been deemed worthy of the $ 5 million @entity3 in @entity4			1
the foundation 's prize committee announced monday that it had decided not to award the prize -- the fourth time there has been no winner in its seven - year history			1
winners must be democratically - elected leaders who have stepped down in the past three years after serving their constitutionally mandated term , and have demonstrated " excellence in office			2
" the committee 's failure to again find a prize winner has led some to comment that its selection criteria are too narrow , and should be broadened to include those showing leadership in civil society			1
but @entity22 , a @entity23 - born telecommunications businessman and billionaire , who created the foundation in 2006 , defended the prize			1
" @entity38 countries are new states -- some of the states did not exist 70 years , 50 years ago , " he said , adding , " in established democracies there are some kinds of checks and balances , but at the early stages in a state 's formation the power of the president is huge ... and we need really to point the finger at where the responsibility lies			1
" let 's put the light there and let us seek heroes			1
" @entity22 : @entity51 's elderly leaders risk more revolutions the previous winners were president @entity58 of @entity59 in 2011 , @entity53 of @entity54 in 2007 and @entity55 of @entity56 in 2008			2
@entity60 was made the honorary inaugural laureate in 2007			0
in 2009 and 2010 there was no winner , but in 2012 the foundation awarded archbishop @entity65 a one - off $ 1 million special prize for his lifelong commitment towards " speaking truth to power			1
" there have also been accusations that failing to find a prize winner can encourage negative stereotypes about @entity51 and its leaders			2
@entity75 , @entity76 's daughter and founding executive director of the foundation , told @entity1 : " we 're holding a mirror up to @entity51 and if there 's a winner , congratulations to the winner and to that country , and if there 's no winner we hope that @entity38 people get more of the leadership they deserve			1
" she added : " i think that when there 's no winner it means that there was no excellent individual			0
some people have no expectations of a winner so it does n't cast @entity51 in a negative light , because it 's what they expect of the continent			0
for other people the fact that we 've even had three winners has opened their eyes to the fact that leadership is much better than it was			0
" the foundation also released its @entity109 ( @entity110 ) -- an annual study that uses 94 indicators to measure good governance in @entity51			0
in the 2013 index @entity114 scored highest for governance , followed by @entity56 and @entity59 , while @entity117 scored worst , followed by @entity118 and @entity119			0
@entity120 was judged to have improved most , while @entity121 deteriorated most			0
the report found that 46 @entity38 countries have seen improved governance since 2000 , with those countries accounting for 94 % of @entity51 's population			2
but the report also found that safety and the rule of law have deteriorated overall , with only 20 countries showing an improvement in this category since 2000 , partly because of increased internal unrest and internal conflicts in the continent			0
some felt the leadership prize , and its lack of a winner , detracted from impact of the governance report			2
at the report launch @entity22 referred to the @entity144 's summit last weekend , where the @entity144 agreed to a resolution stating no sitting @entity38 head of state should appear before the @entity147 , amid accusations that the @entity147 was unfairly targeting @entity51			1
" we need an honest and good dialogue between the @entity147 and the @entity144 , " he said			0
" we can not have a justice system that is in conflict with the continent , because it loses credibility			0

no winner of the 2013 @entity3 in @entity38 leadership
fourth time in seven years that no one has been awarded prize
@entity22 defends the *stringent* award criteria : " let us seek heroes "
