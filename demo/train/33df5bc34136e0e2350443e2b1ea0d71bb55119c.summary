-- it is akin to @entity2 designing his own @entity4 car , getting in the cockpit and driving it to the world title			2
in @entity4 , it would be a mission impossible ; in the winter sport of skeleton racing it is , at the very least , a monstrous mission improbable which briton @entity13 has made an infinite reality from the unlikeliest of beginnings			1
it has earned him the nickname @entity13 and brought him world , @entity21 and @entity22 titles			1
the one medal missing from the trophy cabinet is an @entity26 one , achieved by his fiancee and mother of the couple 's daughter , @entity29 , @entity29 , who won silver seven years ago in @entity32 on one of the sleds he designed			1
there is a somewhat laughable nature to how he found a new career path in such cutting - edge design while based at @entity40 and tasked with working on the @entity41 , which made its combat debut in @entity43 in 2011 with the @entity44 and @entity46 @entity45			1
" i got a memo sent round internally inviting me to a talk about @entity50 , " he recalls			2
" i 'd never heard of the sport so i asked one of the guys , ' who is @entity50 ? ' -- i thought it was a guy to start with			2
" you can imagine my surprise that it turned out to be a sport that changed my life completely			0
" it is a leap of faith to go from the @entity41 , which cost an approximate Â £ 200m each , to design what is effectively a steel tray designed to ensure an athlete is propelled at speeds of up to 130km/h down a sheet ice bobsled run -- head first			1
" i just got hooked on the sport , " he admits			0
" i 'd finished at university and was back at @entity70 ( now @entity40 ) and we were approached by the @entity22 skeleton team to help with their performance			1
" at the time , they were at the back of the field using second - hand equipment from whoever they could			0
" i was one of the @entity22 graduates starting and , three months later , i was the only one working on it , and i got @entity83 to sponsor it			1
" sink or swim it spawned his phd on " factors affecting the performance of skeleton bobsleds " but it was never with a view to competing himself , which came about by force rather than forethought on his part			0
" i first went to @entity96 in @entity97 with something put together with a few nuts and bolts and none of the @entity22 team would ride it , " he recalls			1
" there was this rule , you had to prove it first			0
so it was a simple decision that i could either sink or swim			0
" he swam or at least crashed , got on again , got hooked and could not stop			0
two years later , he was competing properly and after just a year of competition he was @entity22 @entity109			1
fittingly , he won his first major crown -- the @entity111 -- at the same @entity96 venue in 2004 before winning the world title four years later at the same venue , one that has in many ways defined him			2
if he was a designer first and a competitor second , the two now run in parallel			0
for the early years of his career , he used @entity40 as his base to create the skeleton before launching @entity123 with his brother @entity124 in 2000			1
working together , @entity13 the competitor designs the sleds , brother @entity124 manufactures them			1
for @entity13 , the older of the two siblings , his engineering began -- with an admittedly @entity26 slant -- when he nailed a pair of his @entity132 boots to two planks of wood to create his own @entity136 skis in his father 's workshop as a five - year - old			1
" i always liked making things but particularly making things go fast , so this was an inevitable end in some ways			0
" the process has become increasingly technical in the intervening years but he still insists the approach can be simplistic at its core			0
" you break it down as having to go from point a to point b , and you have a certain amount of energy , " he explains , " some of which gets lost along the way			0
my work is to make sure it is more efficient and goes faster			2
i design it , and i 'm the test pilot too			2
" drawing board despite his engineering background he had no experience in computer - aided design nor computational fluid dynamics , a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical methods to solve and analyze issues concerning fluid flows , but , with the help of sponsors , he sat himself down and taught himself			2
" i 've always been of the view that yes there are hurdles but there are ways around them , " he adds , " and it 's a never - ending task because you can always go faster			0
the key is understanding , if you understand the problems , you can go faster			0
" @entity13 explains that he has virtually gone back to the drawing board to create a sled capable of winning him that , as yet , elusive @entity26 title in the last two years			1
what that is exactly , he is loathe to go into detail at the risk of alerting his rivals to what he sees could be a potential advantage but he also argues it is not just about the sled			0
" i want to give myself and @entity29 the best possible chance but the sled does n't win , the athlete does , " he says , looking forward to the @entity26 in @entity194 early next year			1
" for example , at @entity40 i had the most cutting - edge materials			1
i based the sled on the air duct of the @entity41 using carbon fibre , but it did n't necessarily make the sled go faster			1
" the current sled has a steel chassis for its base , able to deal with the top speeds that will be hit in @entity194 , the four or five gs going through it , with @entity13 on board akin to half a tonne at full pelt on the ice			1
" but again it 's all about understanding , " he says			0
" if you understand something , it 's easy to change it			0
" we 're always trying to understand the dynamics of the sled and the aerodynamics of the athlete			0
we also need to personalise the aero as what works for me wo n't necessarily work for @entity29			1
" high - octane world for @entity13 , there are three key areas to his design approach : the aerodynamics , the runners on the ice with its control and handling , and the influence of the sled with its feel on the ice			1
to focus on that aero work in particular , he has sought the help of all and sundry , including the use of the wind tunnels of two @entity4 teams			2
much like @entity4 , mastering the tweaks and additions that work and do n't work can prove to be a very fine art. " i 'd say that 19 out of 20 times , you do stuff that does n't work , " he admits			2
" you have theories , isolate one thing but then it has an impact on everything else			0
" it can work in some ways and have a negative effect in others			2
but you do get that @entity257 moment when it clicks			0
i think i 've had that about seven times in my career and that 's certainly helped me to win major championships			0
" as for @entity13 the athlete , he is , by his own admission , an adrenalin junkie , his earlier love for motocross replaced by the similarly high - octane world of skeleton racing			1
in the past , he used to be an aggressive competitor in terms of his approach to a course , now he is more technical , more free - flowing , enabling him to let the sled do more of the work			1
so how will he do at @entity194 and will the course suit him ? " i hope so but a bit like an @entity4 driver , everyone has a favourite course and mine 's always been @entity281 , it 's where i still hold the course record			1
" at 41 , he is an older competitor although athletes have tended to win medals in the event in their late thirties and early forties			0
he still believes he is at his peak and for the first time in five seasons approaches the season start without an injury setback			0
his training is akin to that of a sprinter , explosive work in the gym , on the track and on the ice , although because of the nature of the sport , his sprinting is limited to 30 - metre bursts at the very maximum			2
' @entity13 ' with age , the only major change has been allowing more recovery time and understanding his ageing limbs better			1
the @entity26 will be his last ever outing as a competitor , his focus after that solely on his future business and the aim is to get through this last season in one piece			1
to date , the worst injury he has sustained crashing is a broken hand but the death of @entity321 in the men 's luge at the same course as the skeleton at the last @entity26 highlights the inherent dangers of the sport			1
" there are risks at that speeds but the courses are designed for the sled to take the hit , " said @entity13			1
" it 's about 30 or 40kg so you make sure it 's in front of you , then you just slide on			0
there 's ice burns but that 's usually the worst of it			0
but such is the design , you wo n't hit the ice head on , usually on the side			2
" " @entity13 , " so named by an @entity347 newspaper after he travelled back from @entity349 with a bobsled full of 20 gallons of water to freeze and better understand as part of his phd , will use brain and body will do their utmost to sort out the one caveat from his career cv			2
" anything can happen once you 're at the @entity362 but a medal 's realistic , " he says			0
science and skill will hold the key in what , come next year , will have been two decades dedicated to the discipline .			0

@entity13 targets @entity26 glory in final ever competition in @entity194 in 2014
@entity13 designs the sleds that he and *girlfriend* @entity29 race
he switched from design work on the @entity41 with @entity40 to this on a whim
@entity380 is a past world , @entity21 and @entity22 champion now targeting @entity26 glory
