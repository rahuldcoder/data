-- @entity1 , who was widely considered the front - runner for an appointment to replace @entity4 as @entity6 senator from @entity7 , will remove herself from consideration for that post , according to three @entity11 sources			2
@entity11 sources said @entity1 has withdrawn her name from consideration for the @entity15 seat			1
sources told @entity0 that , as of about 8 p.m. wednesday , she had not yet informed @entity7 gov. @entity17 of her decision			1
and as the evening wore on , confusion still surrounded the situation -- sources telling @entity0 they were unsure of exactly where the decision stood			0
the 51 - year - old daughter of president @entity26 indicated her interest in filling the seat after @entity29 was nominated to be @entity6 secretary of state			1
@entity29 was sworn in to her new position after being confirmed by the @entity15 on wednesday			1
since president @entity32 selected @entity29 for the post , virtually all of the buzz about her replacement centered around @entity1			1
but as the weeks dragged on , polling showed her popularity among @entity39 dwindling			0
@entity1 's decision to bow out comes a day after her uncle , sen. @entity41 , suffered a seizure at a luncheon after @entity32 's inauguration			2
doctors said the seizure was triggered by fatigue			0
sen. @entity1 , 76 , was diagnosed with brain cancer last may			2
@entity17 has the power to appoint the replacement for the vacated seat , who then faces a special election in 2010 to fill out @entity29 's term			1
earlier this week @entity17 said he was close , but had not yet picked @entity29 's replacement			1
earlier in the week , @entity17 said he may interview " a candidate or two " while in @entity56 for the inauguration			0
he added that he could settle on a choice " by this weekend			0
" before this year , @entity1 's forays into the public sphere were generally limited to nonpartisan activity , penning books on civil liberties and serving as the de facto guardian of her father 's legacy			2
" i would be an unconventional choice -- i have n't followed a traditional path , but i think i bring a lifetime of experience to this , " she told @entity69 last month			0
the comment came during a media blitz after she had been criticized for remaining cloistered since her name was floated for the job			0
there are a slew of high - profile candidates for @entity29 's @entity15 seat , including @entity7 attorney general @entity82 , whose last name carries some star power of its own in @entity7 , where his father , @entity85 , was once governor			1
a poll earlier this month showed slightly more @entity39 would rather @entity85 be appointed than @entity1 .			0

@entity1 had *spoken* publicly about her *desire* for @entity29 's @entity15 seat
gov. @entity17 is charged with appointing replacement until special election
@entity1 is the daughter of former president @entity26
