-- he has met the @entity3 ' former first lady , and an audience with @entity5 awaits , but the @entity3 that world champion boxer @entity6 really wants to face next is proving a bit more elusive			1
the @entity9 fighter has set his heart on becoming the planet 's best pound - for - pound pugilist , and for him that means taking on the undefeated @entity14 -- who , as a five - division champion , once laid claim to that coveted crown			1
@entity6 , 24 , unified the @entity19 super and @entity21 light welterweight world championship belts in july by defeating @entity3 @entity22 in @entity23 in july , while @entity14 recently returned to the ring after a 16 - month absence			1
six - time world champion @entity14 has won all of his 42 fights as a professional , 26 by knockout , and emerged victorious from a controversial contest with @entity31 on september 18			1
but the fight many boxing fans want to see is @entity14 against eight - division champion @entity34 -- the @entity35 rated by @entity36 as the best pound - for - pound boxer in the world			1
" @entity14 pound for pound is probably one of the best fighters in the world , " @entity6 , who won an @entity40 silver medal in the lightweight category at the @entity42 in 2004 , told @entity0			1
" me and @entity34 both want to fight him , but that will never happen because at the moment he does n't want to fight either of us			2
but it will come to a stage when the pressure will be so much on @entity14 that he 'll have to take the fight			0
" @entity6 doubts that a match - up between his @entity56 stablemate @entity14 and @entity57 's @entity34 will ever happen , with disagreements over drug - testing and money having previously prevented the fight			1
" you 've got two different promotion teams , and for them to agree on terms for a fight is very difficult , " he said			0
" firstly , you 've got @entity14 saying that @entity34 has to take so many drug tests and blood tests , then @entity34 talking about the purse			2
but that fight will generate about $ 100 million each , so it 's a lot of money to say no to			0
" @entity14 , 34 , and @entity34 , 32 , have both occupied the position of best pound - for - pound boxer in the world , and @entity6 is aiming to emulate the success enjoyed by the decorated duo			1
" i want to be known as a legend in the sport and i want to win everything			0
i want to be a pound - for - pound champion of the world , and every morning when i wake up that 's what drives me to the gym to train hard , " he said			1
" when i 'm tired in the gym , that 's what pushes me , because i want to be the best there is			0
and , i 'm nearly there			0
i 'm only 24 , i 'm the unified champion , i 'm a two - time world champion , and i 've done it so young			2
but i want to achieve more			0
" @entity6 has seen his international profile increase in the last 18 months , having fought in the @entity3 on three occasions since making his @entity3 bow against @entity95 at @entity97 's @entity96 in march 2010			1
it would now appear even politicians are starting to sit up and take notice of the @entity102 - born fighter , with @entity6 having recently met @entity3 secretary of state @entity103 and now being lined up for an audience with president @entity5 later this year			1
" i was invited to go to the state building , " said @entity6			0
" @entity103 invited me and my team			0
it was an honor to be part of that event			0
it was about the @entity112 sportsmen who were influential and who do good things in the @entity112 community			0
" i enjoyed it and they want me back over there in december probably to meet @entity5 , so it 's good times			2
" when they first got talking about it , i thought they were just pulling my leg , but they were quite serious about it , and i thought ' wow '			0
i might never get the chance to go to the @entity127 or meet @entity5 again , so i 'm going to make the most of it			2

boxing champion @entity6 tells @entity0 he wants to face @entity14
the @entity132 says he does n't think @entity14 will ever face @entity34
@entity6 has set his sights on becoming world 's best pound - for - pound fighter
the 24 - year - old will meet @entity3 president @entity5 later this year
