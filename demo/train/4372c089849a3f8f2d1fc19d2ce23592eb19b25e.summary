-- many people think @entity3 's fame rests on her dramatic disappearance in 1937			1
i do n't think so			1
i think her life has been overshadowed by her death			2
i think that when her @entity11 aircraft is finally found , the focus will return to her life and her remarkable accomplishments			2
she will become even more famous than she is today			1
a new , privately funded investigation into one of the most famous missing persons cases in history will start this summer , carried out by @entity20			1
it will be headed by @entity22			2
the group has mounted 10 previous expeditions to @entity25 , also known as @entity25 , in the @entity26			2
i wish him well , but my experience leads me to believe @entity22 will come up empty again			2
@entity3 started flying in the 1920s			1
her first plane was powered by one of the first -- and still unproven -- air - cooled engines ever made			1
but @entity3 possessed more than guts and a passion for flying			1
she was blessed with good looks and intelligence			2
she thrived on publicity , charmed men and set as her mission in life the empowerment of women			1
she went on the lecture circuit to finance her flights and became wildly popular , the @entity46 of her day			1
@entity3 helped create and lead the @entity47 , the women 's flying organization that promoted women fliers , and was idolized by her flying peers as much because she was fun as because she was efficient			1
she married a successful publisher , @entity52 , who looked like a stand - in for @entity55 's alter ego , @entity56			1
he devoted his life to her			0
in a time when planes were being perfected and aviators were the superstars of the day , she matched the men			1
@entity3 's most daring achievement was that five years to the day after @entity64 's flight , she took off from @entity65 , @entity66 , and safely landed her red single - engine @entity67 in a farmer 's field in @entity71 , @entity72			1
after a harrowing flight replete with equipment malfunctions and bad weather , she became the first woman and the second pilot to fly solo across the @entity78			0
after the flight , she was elevated to almost mythic status			0
" @entity84 , forget @entity85 , she was in a realm beyond stardom , " recalled @entity82 , who knew her well			0
she set countless speed , long - distance and altitude records			1
she was on what she planned as her last record - breaking flight in 1937 when she went missing , flying around the world at the equator , which had never before been done			0
she had always flown solo , but on this last flight , she took along a navigator , @entity96			0
she was on the last , most dangerous leg of the flight , taking off from @entity99 , @entity100 , for @entity101 , a dot in the middle of the @entity26 a bit north of the equator and 2,556 miles away			0
she was landing there to refuel the @entity11 before flying on to @entity106			0
when she failed to appear , the @entity107 , a @entity108 coast guard vessel waiting at @entity101 to guide her in , radioed the world			0
the final resting place of her plane has never been ascertained , but most fliers and history buffs , including me , think that the plane rests on the ocean floor somewhere in the vicinity of her destination of @entity101 , rather than @entity25 , 400 miles away			1
but the ocean is 17,500 feet deep around @entity101 , a mile deeper than the resting place of the @entity121			0
only recently has technology allowed the construction of underwater vehicles that can endure such extreme pressure			0
in 2009 , i was on the second leg of the @entity128 's search for @entity3			1
the @entity128 is a 204 - foot research vessel that set out from @entity130 to search the ocean floor to the west of @entity101			0
@entity133 , founder of @entity134 and creator @entity135 , was behind the expedition			2
a great admirer of @entity3 , he was also the impetus behind the recent movie , " @entity3			1
" there were 29 of us aboard the @entity128 : scientists , oceanographers , technicians , computer experts and ordinary seamen			0
@entity149 underwater vehicles , bright yellow sonar subs 12 feet long , did the searching			0
for 46 days , the @entity152 looked for the plane round the clock			2
going on the assumption that headwinds had slowed the plane down more than @entity159 realized , the subs were deployed to survey to the west of @entity101			2
the @entity152 work by pinging the ocean floor as they travel just above it , sending up signals that are displayed on computer screens as dots that change color as the subs ping over different surfaces			0
the softest surface , sand , transmits as blue dots ; hard stone and metal transmit as red dots that blend off into green			0
the @entity11 , as a metal object , would show up red			0
once an @entity152 pinged a large metal object : it turned out to be a 55 - gallon steel drum			0
other than that , the ocean floor was as barren as the moon			0
in the past 16 or so years , @entity20 has come back with all sorts of artifacts that @entity22 was sure would prove to have belonged to @entity3			1
nothing has held up to scrutiny			0
while his hunches have led him to concentrate on this island , @entity188 was one of the first islands searched , five days after @entity3 went missing			1
at that time , three planes catapulted from the battleship @entity194 searched the area			0
if one of the three pilots had sighted anything even slightly promising , the pilot would have reported it			2
the pilot who sighted the plane would instantly have been the hero of the hour			2
such a sighting was never made			0
at president @entity203 's bidding , the @entity194 was within days joined by a fleet of nine ships of the @entity206 , including an aircraft carrier that held 62 planes , to look for @entity3			1
the ships and the planes then conducted a search they estimated as covering 150,000 square miles			0
the @entity128 only searched the ocean floor to the west of @entity101			0
it is my best guess that the plane rests on the ocean floor to the east , waiting to be found by the next expedition			1
whoever finds @entity3 and her @entity11 will deservedly become famous			1
i agree with secretary of state @entity222 , who has said the search itself is inspirational			0
it will be wonderful news when one day our lost heroine is found			2
in the meantime , @entity3 remains an icon , revered by young women , remembered by many for her signal accomplishments , remembered by all because of her dramatic end			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			1

@entity237 thinks new expedition wo n't find @entity3 's vanished plane
@entity237 wrote a biography of @entity3 , a *pioneer* of aviation who inspired women pilots
@entity3 was wildly famous in her day , broke countless speed and distance records
@entity237 went on expedition to find @entity3 plane ; thinks new project is looking at *wrong* island
