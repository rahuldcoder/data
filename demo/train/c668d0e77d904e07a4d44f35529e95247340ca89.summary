editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			0
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity20 , @entity21 ( @entity9 ) -- in previous episodes of @entity23 , we road - tripped through @entity24 , shopped for dirty bombs in @entity26 , and hunted mutant wild boars in @entity28			2
little did we know that all of our harrowing journeys would leave us only semi-prepared for a recent trip to war - ravaged , godforsaken @entity32			1
since 1989 , a series of brutal civil wars -- primarily fought by drug - addicted , prepubescent orphans -- has rendered @entity32 one of the most dangerous countries in the world			1
everyone has heard the stories of abject poverty , ubiquitous substance abuse and wanton violence taking place there , but we do n't really believe anything that we do n't see for ourselves			1
so , stomachs firmly knotted , off we went			0
we arrived in @entity32 with a small crew of three and quickly rendezvoused with a local journalist who would be our fixer and guide			1
our first shooting location was the @entity54 slum , home to 80,000 people living in conditions that redefine squalor			0
miles of rotting garbage surround the slum , which has no sewage system			0
pretty much everyone -- even the local government officials -- defecates and urinates in the open			2
drugs , prostitution and armed robbery are the main industries			2
we got to know some of the residents of @entity54 , who told us their stories as they smoked heroin and cocaine and begged us for money			0
next we visited a local brothel			1
the women who lived there talked with us about the @entity79 soldiers who have sex with the child prostitutes and beat the older women , and then leave without paying			1
watch episode 2 from the vice guide to @entity32 on @entity9 but perhaps the most revelatory portions of our trip to @entity32 came from meeting the major warlords of the nation 's civil wars			1
there 's a tradition in @entity32 militias of taking on extravagant noms de guerre			1
hence , our subjects were named general @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			0
the latter , in particular , was one of the most notorious @entity32 warlords			1
he claims to have personally killed 20,000 people including babies , and to have sometimes cannibalized his victims			1
today , @entity97 goes by his birth name , which is @entity106			0
during our time together , he told us that @entity32 will surely implode into civil war again when the @entity79 leaves next year			1
but in the meantime , @entity106 wants to redeem himself			0
he offered us a glimpse of the @entity32 that he wants to forge , and we found ourselves growing to like him			2
he took us to his church , where he rehabilitates child soldiers			2
we watched as he preached his way through @entity113 on a sunday			0
is there a chance that his mission will succeed , and further civil war can be averted in this desperate country ? that 's one of the many questions that we came away with upon our safe return from @entity32			1
watch our documentary about our time there and see what you think .			0
