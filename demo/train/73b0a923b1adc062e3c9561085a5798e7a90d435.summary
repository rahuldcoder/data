-- when @entity3 was behind schedule in delivering the @entity5 , the @entity2 government called @entity6 to take charge			1
@entity6 had already successfully led the bid committee that saw @entity3 awarded the @entity5			1
when she received the appointment in 2000 to become president of the organizing committee , she had just four years instead of the usual seven , to deliver a successful games			1
she was the first female president of both a bid committee and an organizing committee for an @entity12 " we were the miracle , we showed a different @entity2 , a can - do @entity2 in four years instead of seven , " she says			1
now @entity6 , who was named an ambassador at large by the @entity2 government , has written a book entitled , " @entity19 "			1
the personal memoir captures her experience of running the @entity12 along with an assessment of the country 's financial crisis			1
in an interview with @entity0 , she says @entity2 should use lessons learned during the @entity12 to turn around its fortunes during its current economic crisis , which has seen 64 % youth unemployment , a bailout from the @entity31 and a crippling austerity drive			1
" it 's not by chance that the crisis came , " she says			0
" politicians like to blame each other			0
they should have a lesson of how @entity2 performed during the @entity12			1
with the @entity2 economy in its sixth year of recession , @entity6 is n't just critical of how the government is handling the crisis -- she 's also concerned about @entity2 's reputation overseas			1
" the image of @entity2 around the world is that it 's in crisis and @entity2 are lazy and never perform			2
what i know about @entity2 is we created a miracle in the making of the @entity12			1
" the @entity2 i know is so different from the @entity2 i see now			2
all this achievement was dropped , the politicians dropped it			0
" @entity6 , 57 , who grew up in the island of @entity54 , trained as a lawyer and served two terms in @entity2 parliament			1
with her direct manner , she has won both friends and enemies among her fellow @entity2			2
in 1996 , with @entity2 still wounded from losing out to @entity61 1996 for the centenary of the modern @entity12 , @entity6 was asked by the prime minister to lead the bid for @entity3 to be host city in 2004			1
after a successful bid , @entity6 was initially excluded from organizing the @entity12 themselves , but was called back in 2000 when progress was stalling and the @entity68 was beginning to question whether @entity3 could deliver on time			1
although questions continued to be asked about @entity2 's readiness , @entity72 , president of the @entity68 , eventually described @entity5 as " unforgettable , dream @entity12 "			1
" it 's a woman 's dream to achieve something unique and monumental for our country , and shows that women can do whatever they want , " says @entity6			2
" we can break the glass ceiling and show that there 's no such thing as mission impossible			0
" i want this book to show about the effort and struggle that every woman and every young person can do to pursue his or her dream			0
" in preparation for the @entity12 , @entity3 built numerous infrastructure projects , from a new airport and new tram line to renewed public spaces and state - of - the - art sports facilities			2
however , @entity6 says not enough was done to plan for the legacy , and many of the facilities went to waste			2
" i 'm saddened to see that state - of - the - art facilities are abandoned , empty , closed , " she says			0
" if people ask me about organizing a games , i would say ' plan for the day after , not just for the @entity12 '			2
the excellent facilities can really make a difference for the day after			0
" she adds : " i went to successive governments and i urged them to show me a plan for the day after			0
" they just told me ' you do your job , we have everything in hand '			0
they did nothing and lost the readiness of people to do things differently , to show the world a different @entity2			2
" as well as the facilities lying empty , @entity6 says a return to the public spirit , which was evident during the @entity12 , would help @entity2 through its current crisis			1
" an @entity12 is a unique opportunity to get citizens engaged with a noble cause , " she says			2
" we had no tradition of volunteering in @entity2 , but we got 165,000 wanting to help			0
it was like an army , but it was lost			0
" through this tough time for @entity2 , people are selling their houses , selling their cars , taking their children out of university			0
imagine if this volunteer spirit and way of helping people was still in place ? things would be different			0
" this kind of common spirit is needed in a country , not just in good times			0
" since the @entity12 , @entity6 has become active with the @entity149 and @entity151 's @entity150 , running a project which asks global leaders to share their experience with students			1
" after my disappointment about how the politicians let down people i turned to the international stage and that 's why i participated in the @entity161 , " she says			0
after her years out of the spotlight , @entity6 is embarking on a lecture tour in the @entity164 , publicizing " @entity19 " and sharing her dream that @entity2 can soon be a proud nation once more			1
" even if there 's a lot of drama in my book , i believe there 's a better chapter ahead			0
we can be the authors of our own story , " she says			0
" my @entity2 drama , " published by @entity176 , is out now .			0
