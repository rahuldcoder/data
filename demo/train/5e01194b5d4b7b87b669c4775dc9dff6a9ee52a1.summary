@entity0 , @entity1 -- a new @entity2 / @entity4 poll shows a statistical dead heat between @entity1 @entity7 sen. @entity6 and her @entity9 opponent @entity8 , with @entity6 at 49 % , @entity8 at 47 % , and a margin of error of plus - or - minus 4 %			1
perhaps even more telling is another politician 's approval rating , and he 's not even in the @entity1			1
president @entity16 has only a 39 % approval rating in @entity1 , the new poll shows			1
fifty - seven percent of voters say they disapprove of the way he is handling his job			0
that 's a far fall for a president who beat his @entity9 opponents here in the @entity1 overwhelmingly in both 2008 and just two years ago in 2012			1
and that 's part of the problem			0
@entity8 and his supporters are tying the incumbent senator to the president , as exemplified by a recent campaign sign from @entity8 supporters : " stand with @entity16 , vote for @entity6			1
" the ' 99 percent ' factor it 's why @entity8 rarely speaks a sentence without tying @entity6 to the president			1
" she 's voting with the president 99 % of the time , " @entity8 told us over and over , just has he did minutes earlier at a small business event here earlier this week			1
@entity6 is just as disciplined with her responses			0
" you know , @entity8 can talk about 99 percent all he wants , " @entity6 told us later in @entity45			1
" this race is not between the president and @entity8 , this race is between me and @entity8			0
" @entity6 has something going for her that some @entity52 colleagues around the country in tough races do not			0
she is a former governor who is not only well known , but relatively well liked			0
her favorability rating in the @entity2 / @entity4 poll is 52 % , much higher than the president 's			1
@entity8 is under water -- with 50 % saying they have an unfavorable view of him , 48 % favorable			0
@entity6 tries to exploit that by painting him as an opportunist -- repeatedly reminding voters that two years ago @entity8 was a senator from @entity64 , until he lost			1
" when he was in @entity65 representing @entity64 he was there for the corporate special interests , " @entity6 told @entity2			2
" i 'm going to continue to remind people what he represented when he was in @entity64 and it was n't our middle - class families , it was n't our small businesses , it was n't what 's good for @entity1 , " @entity6 told us			2
@entity8 and other @entity9 insist he has beaten the carpetbagger issue by visiting with @entity1 voters all over the state ( he still drives the beat - up pickup truck that became famous in 2010 when he won @entity83 's @entity52 seat in a @entity64 special election )			1
when asked about his move on the campaign trail , @entity8 notes that he was born in the @entity1 and has family ties that go back generations			1
" we have long and strong ties to @entity1 and so does senator @entity6			2
we both care about @entity1 so let 's talk about where we 're going , not about where we 've been , " @entity8 said			2
fear - mongering ? another way strategists here in both parties agree @entity8 has made gains is by seizing on ripped - from - the - headlines national - security issues like the threat from @entity99 and @entity100 , and playing them as examples of how @entity65 is broken			0
@entity6 calls it fear - mongering , which @entity8 naturally dismisses			2
" what i hear is that people are deeply concerned about the border , they 're deeply concerned about @entity99 , they 're deeply concerned about the lack of clear and coherent foreign policy , and the fact that senator @entity6 is on the @entity114 and has endorsed those incoherent policies from day one , " @entity8 told us			2
the @entity99 threat does hit home here in a unique way			0
the first @entity119 beheaded , @entity120 , was from @entity1			0
national versus local issues while @entity8 's campaign aides are quite candid that they believe their path to victory is to nationalize the race by linking @entity6 to the president and playing up national - security issues , @entity6 is trying hard to keep it local			1
she is already known as someone with exceptional constituent services , now as senator and before that as governor			0
even @entity9 sources here speak admiringly of her commitment to returning regularly for local events throughout her last six years in the @entity52			0
@entity6 insists that is what people are most about			0
" it 's the people who are working now up at the @entity144 prison because i went in and fought to get that prison open after it sat empty for 12 years , its the 12 people who are in their homes because i worked with them when they were being foreclosed on , " @entity6 told us			0
" i was at @entity149 in @entity150 yesterday i did n't get one question about a national issue , " she said			0
keeping it local is a national @entity7 strategy , in a climate where disapproval of the president and @entity65 in general leaves them little choice			1
@entity7 are using it in @entity161 , too , with incumbent @entity162 as they pummel her @entity9 opponent on state education issues			1
whether that strategy can work here and elsewhere may determine whether @entity7 can keep control of the @entity52 during @entity16 's last two years in office			2
@entity2 's @entity168 contributed to this report .			0
