@entity0 -- @entity3 democratic candidate @entity2 was glad when his party 's @entity5 campaign arm injected $ 1 million into his race , but that did n't keep him from pledging to oppose the party 's leader in the chamber			1
@entity2 said thursday during a televised debate that he would vote against prolonging sen. @entity14 's tenure as the @entity15 , and challenged his @entity17 opponent gov. @entity16 to pledge to oppose @entity5 minority leader @entity18 as the @entity17 leader			1
" @entity14 and @entity18 have given us the most dysfunctional government in a generation and they need to step aside , " @entity2 said			2
@entity2 's pledge to oppose his party 's leader in the @entity5 does n't come as much of a surprise to those following the race			1
behind the scenes , @entity14 not - so - quietly opposed @entity2 's bid to be the party 's nominee in @entity3 , which set off a feud between @entity14 and former senate majority leader @entity34 of @entity3 , who backed @entity2 's bid			1
how @entity3 became the @entity5 fight surprise but @entity2 framed his opposition in anti-washington terms , calling @entity0 " broken " and both parties " beholden to big money			0
" " our @entity41 has been bought off and nothing is going to change until we get the money out of our politics , " @entity2 said			0
" the people of @entity3 deserve more than business as usual			0
" @entity2 has gained a reputation for his folksy campaign style , even writing and performing modified renditions of popular songs -- turning " @entity53 " into a song about his low - budget campaign			0
and despite the @entity56 's $ 1 million investment in @entity3 , the support did n't flow directly to @entity57 -- instead funding attack ads against @entity16			0
and those attacks could bolster either @entity2 's campaign or former sen. @entity62 's independent campaign			1
@entity62 , who edged out @entity2 in recent polls , has not said who he would caucus with , but his previous endorsements ' for president @entity67 's two presidential campaigns have fueled speculation that he could caucus with democrats if elected			2
could @entity70 tip the balance of the @entity5 ? @entity72 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 said he would vote against @entity14 for the party 's leadership
the *statement* comes after @entity14 reportedly opposed @entity2 's candidacy
