with nearest rival @entity11 slipping up at @entity12 on saturday , goals from @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 ensured @entity1 took full advantage			1
@entity15 's 3 - 2 home defeat by @entity16 means @entity1 is seven points clear at the summit following the weekend 's action			1
with just one more game before the winter break , @entity1 is in great shape heading into the second half of the season , although manager @entity25 remains cautious			2
@entity26 keeps @entity12 in @entity28 title race " it was a good result for us against a difficult team , but the season is far from over , " he told reporters			0
" winning the title is never easy but through our good organisation and solid play we hope to show it 's within our grasp			0
" it took around 90 seconds for @entity1 to move ahead through @entity8 , before @entity9 produced one of his trademark curling free - kicks to double the lead			2
@entity10 added a third with a low drive after picking up @entity46 's pass			0
@entity6 's day grew even worse when it was reduced to 10 men following @entity49 's rash challenge on @entity50 , which earned him a second booking			2
@entity53 elsewhere , @entity11 continued its rich vein of form by defeating @entity56 4 - 1			1
@entity57 fired the @entity58 ahead after just 36 seconds to register the second fastest goal in @entity4 this season			2

police investigate @entity93 racism claim in the @entity93 , @entity94 moved into fourth position following a narrow 1 - 0 victory over @entity97			1
@entity99 's 75th minute goal proved enough for @entity94 to claim all three points a hard - fought affair			2
" i think if there was one team to win this game it was us , " @entity94 manager @entity102 told reporters			2
" we were very patient and persistent in what we were doing and kept moving the ball well			0
" we held on to the win			0
obviously in this season we will continue to suffer goals in the last minute because football is unpredictable , but i think today the players showed the desire and ambition to put the wrong right and we managed to hang on to the result			0
" there was drama in the dying stages of the contest when @entity97 striker @entity123 was left prostrate on the turf after a collision with @entity94 goalkeeper @entity126			1
the home side continued to play on with the @entity128 clutching his head on the turf and @entity97 's players urging for the ball to be kicked out of play			2
referee @entity134 and his assistants allowed the game to continue and @entity97 manager @entity137 was left frustrated by the decision			0
he told reporters : " i was very angry and it was n't because it was n't a free - kick or a red card for @entity126 or a penalty or whatever , but we always talk about people , there is a debate , should we kick the ball out ? " it is the same debate in every country - we have a referee and two linesmen so we just go on until the referee blows the whistle			0
" but with possible head injuries , like this one , there is no doubt , you have all the linesmen and the referee and they are connected			0
" i watched it afterward on the television and when it happened , when @entity123 is going down to the ground the referee is watching them , the linesman is watching them and still they let the game go on , it is such a poor decision and dangerous as well			0
" in the day 's other game , @entity170 was held to a goalless draw by @entity173			0
@entity175 's bid for @entity177 record falters in @entity180 , defending champion @entity178 claimed a 3 - 1 win to move back into third place			1
@entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 were all on target for @entity178 , which sits 12 points behind league leaders @entity175			0
@entity183 's stunning strike put @entity178 ahead after 20 minutes , only for @entity190 to draw level soon after thanks to @entity194 's close - range finish			1
but @entity178 pushed on after the interval and @entity184 fired home on 58 minutes before @entity185 sealed the win eight minutes later			2
@entity190 , which has lost its past six games , is now seven points from safety in 16th position , having sacked coach @entity202 on december 3			1
new manager meanwhile , @entity204 has announced that it has parted company with @entity207 coach @entity206 following saturday 's 3 - 1 home defeat by @entity209			1
a statement on the club 's website read : " in light of the recent poor run of form in the @entity177 , @entity204 have opted to release @entity206 from his duties as head coach with immediate effect			1

" former @entity225 coach @entity224 will take over for the rest of the season with his side seventh in the league and still in the @entity230			0
" the players gave me a positive reception and i could tell they were totally focused on the cup game , " @entity224 told the club 's official website			0
" though i 've watched the first team train on a regular basis , looking on from a distance is not the same as being in charge yourself			0
" i 'm now going to spend time considering how best to approach the game against @entity243			0
if we are to do well the psychological side of things will be very important			0
