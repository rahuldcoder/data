-- on a cold december evening , the green and white of @entity1 were demolishing the red and gold of @entity4 and extending their lead at the top of @entity9 's @entity8			1
at the same time , a few hundred of their fans were demolishing seats , throwing green smoke bombs onto the pitch and extending their reputation for notoriety			2
for @entity1 's management , it was the final straw			1
they banned 128 @entity1 supporters from attending future home matches and coach @entity23 bemoaned the " powder keg " atmosphere generated by a group of fanatical followers called the @entity27			1
there are passionate soccer supporters the world over , the sort who name sons after their clubs ' stars or travel hundreds of miles on a wet tuesday evening			1
but @entity1 's @entity27 brings a sectarian flavor to its support for @entity41 's catholic club			1
in fact , it 's more than a flavor -- though its members have described themselves as " anti-sectarian			0
" this week @entity1 went before the disciplinary committee of @entity50 football 's governing body @entity48 for the seventh time in as many years			1
the latest infraction : the @entity27 had unfolded huge pictures of a @entity9 nationalist hero , @entity54 , and more controversially of @entity56 hunger - striker @entity55 before a recent game against @entity58			1
above the portraits , the slogan : " @entity61			0
" @entity48 punishes such behavior , " particularly messages that are of a political , ideological , religious , offensive or provocative nature			1
" it holds clubs responsible for the actions of its fans -- whether signs , chanting or throwing pyrotechnics			1
@entity1 was fined 50,000 euros and responded by asking all its fans to " unite with the club " with no more such banners			1
@entity1 is one half of the most famous -- and at times infamous -- rivalry in @entity77 football			1
its old enemy @entity79 has @entity81 affiliations and for many years had a policy of not buying @entity84 players			0
submerged in debt , @entity79 fell on hard times			0
now the club -- resurrected as a new company but still featuring its predecessor 's team manager and several of its players -- is in the lower reaches of the @entity93			2
but in the past the two @entity41 clubs ' epic battles for supremacy have been accompanied by provocative anthems , sectarian songs , violence and even deaths among supporters			1
there was a time when a club 's directors would see such behavior as part of the fans ' identity with a cause or heritage			1
football in @entity48 grew up in the slums of industrialized cities , generations before the term " politically correct " was born			0
@entity1 was founded to provide charity to @entity119 catholics who had fled famine for work in @entity9			1
and religious identity was a mooring in an alien land			2
similarly in @entity126 , where one in four inhabitants in the late 19th century was of @entity119 origin , @entity125 was run by @entity129 supporting @entity130 while @entity126 was dominated by @entity81 and @entity132 figures			0
today club football is big business with sponsors paying millions to have their names on stadiums and shirts , and top players earning six figures a week			2
@entity141 calculates that the 20 richest clubs ( all in @entity48 ) generated more than $ 6 billion in revenues in 2011/12			2
a club like @entity1 which competes in the @entity145 wants to attract international stars regardless of how or whether they were baptized			1
getting into constant trouble with the @entity50 football authorities does n't help			1
the fines are minimal ; it 's the damage to reputation that puts off sponsors			0
after the @entity55 incident , @entity1 's chief executive , @entity153 reminded fans that @entity1 was " a top football club in fantastic shape , aiming to play its part as a major football club on the @entity50 stage			1
" but fans do n't always want to co-operate with the new corporate branding that clubs like to project			1
for sure , those attached to sectarian labels are a very small minority			0
the rest of society has moved on and religious observance has shrunk			2
but traditions and rivalries are ingrained for literally millions of fans in the @entity77 and around the world			0
supporters of @entity8 side @entity174 have launched a vocal campaign against plans by the owner to change the club 's name to @entity174 to broaden its appeal in @entity181			1
the name of the protest group -- " @entity184 " -- is a mark of the emotions generated			0
similarly @entity188 fans last year protested the decision of @entity191 owner @entity190 to change the team 's colors from blue to " lucky red			0
" many fans just do n't trust the corporate ownership of their clubs			1
in july , the new director of @entity200 at @entity201 made the mistake of saying his mission was to " better engage them , serve them and monetize them			0
" beyond @entity77 , regional , political and class differences -- or the memory of them -- still feed the rivalries and passions of football fans			1
in @entity58 , both @entity58 and @entity212 have their own versions of the " @entity27 " -- known as @entity214			2
@entity58 supporters tend to be more working class ; @entity212 's from more affluent parts of the city			0
several @entity220 clubs -- @entity212 among them -- have been in trouble because of a @entity224 fringe of supporters			2
the @entity227 club @entity226 , which was the favorite of @entity220 dictator @entity229 , has a notorious group of right - wing " @entity232 " @entity214 among its fans			1
in the past , they have even taunted @entity236 supporters of rivals as @entity238 with posters recalling the @entity240			0
history also infuses @entity243 's greatest rivalry , between @entity244 and @entity245			0
@entity244 is the champion of the @entity247 , traditionally a more left - wing club than @entity245 , representative of the capital 's elite			0
these passions still have a feverish hold			0
but a new era of multi-million dollar sponsorship and television deals , stadia with executive boxes behind smoked glass , and the spiraling price of match tickets , has changed the game			0
consultants @entity263 said in a recent report : " all sporting bodies are walking a tightrope , as they attempt to balance increased commercial demands on their sports with the often conflicting need to maintain the integrity and unpredictability that make sporting competitions so exciting and appealing to their supporters			2
" one example : @entity244 's first - ever deal with a sponsor in 2011 , a five - year contract with the @entity277 ( later @entity278 ) worth more than $ 200 million			0
fans began a petition against the commercialization of their beloved team , and one of its most famous former players , @entity286 , described the deal as " vulgar			0
" but the sponsorship remained			0
fans ( and some players ) also grumble at the need for their teams to go on tiring pre-season tours of @entity295 or the @entity296 to open up new markets for their club 's " brand "			2
the big football clubs with monstrous wage bills could not survive without sponsorship and television deals , whose value is growing faster than revenue from tickets			0
but the fans are still the fabric of any club			2
in the era of social media they are able to organize and protest , and more are doing just that .			0

a group of @entity1 fans lands the club with a fine after *displaying* banners at games
the " @entity27 " contravened rules against " provocative " religious and political messages
@entity1 has banned more than 100 fans from attending games and calls on supporters to unite
traditional religious and political *allegiances* of @entity50 fans often clash with the commercial *ambitions* of the clubs
