-- i was born in @entity2 , @entity3 -- a beautiful country rich in culture and landscape			1
but for all its wonder and charm , @entity3 is also a country where from 150,000 to 200,000 people were afflicted by polio in the mid- 1980s and , even as recently as 2009 , was home to nearly half the world 's new polio cases			1
polio is a debilitating disease			2
it attacks the nervous system and can lead to partial or full paralysis for life , and in some cases , even death			2
but , the great news is that today , @entity3 and @entity22 were officially certified by the @entity23 as being polio - free -- a momentous achievement for global public health and the worldwide effort to eradicate polio			1
@entity3 beats the odds and beats polio but this extraordinary feat was n't easy			1
most experts believed that @entity3 , with its high population density , poor health care services and regional accessibility problems , would remain the most polio - endemic region in the world			1
but @entity3 has n't reported a new case since early 2011 , which led @entity23 director - general @entity39 to say : " @entity3 has shown the world that there is no such thing as impossible			1
this is likely the greatest lesson and the greatest inspiration for the rest of the world			2
" i , too , believe this is the greatest inspiration for the world			0
this victory -- like the eradication of smallpox -- is one of the most amazing achievements in global health			0
and i 'm humbled to support and commend my country -- and the communities , families and workers on the ground -- for without them , this would not be possible			0
their bravery , grace and conviction to end polio once and for all is something of great strength and admiration			0
great achievements do n't just happen ; they require the great efforts of many			0
the polio eradication movement , started in 1988 , was a joint effort between the @entity3 government ; who ; @entity73 ; the @entity74 ; @entity75 and various other @entity76 ; the @entity77 , @entity78 , the @entity79 and about 2 million workers who vaccinated nearly 170 million throughout the country to finally wipe out the disease			1
truly , this worldwide effort should serve as a reminder that when the global community bands together to solve an issue , great things can be achieved			0
and today should serve as a call to not simply continue the efforts but to exponentially increase them			0
the tireless work and the steadfast determination of so many around the world has brought us to this monumental milestone today , because with committed people , volunteers , communities and cooperation comes real change			1
just last year , i joined the @entity101 at the annual @entity102 on the @entity103 at @entity104 in @entity105 to advocate for an end to extreme poverty by 2030			0
chief among the priorities was a focus on health , vaccines and immunizations			0
and on that day , looking out at the sea of 60,000 global citizens advocating for change and an end to polio by 2018 , i knew the end was possible			2
so , smile as we celebrate a polio - free @entity3 -- a significant public health achievement that will leave a lasting impact on children 's health in @entity3 and around the world			1
this can inspire the global community to take on other diseases as well			0
a polio - free @entity3 is not a polio - free world , and we must remain vigilant to ensure every child around the globe receives the vaccine until we achieve a world free of polio			1
the global health community is still more than $ 1 billion short on funding for vaccinations -- and while the @entity77 , @entity78 and others have led the way -- other countries such as @entity142 need to reaffirm their support			0
only three nations have yet to eradicate the crippling disease : @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148			0
as we declare @entity3 polio - free , we can call on countries and governments around the globe to follow this tremendous example and make the world free of polio by 2018			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			2
