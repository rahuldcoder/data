last week , @entity0 was n't even on an @entity2 team			1
in two weeks , he might not be on one			0
but for now , @entity0 -- the first openly gay , active player in the @entity4 ' four big sports leagues -- is , by jersey sales , the @entity2 's most popular player			1
@entity2 senior vice president @entity7 said tuesday that @entity0 ' no. 98 @entity9 uniform is the top - seller on @entity2 , besting the likes of @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
the interest is coming from the fans @entity0 has earned since announcing last year , when he was still unemployed , that he was gay			1
" @entity0 ' return to the league represents a historic moment , and fans continue to show their support by ( buying ) @entity0 's jersey , " said @entity7			1
not bad for a player who , just last week , inked a 10 - day contract with the @entity9			1
and the @entity26 graduate hardly dominated in his lone game back on the court , going scoreless while compiling two rebounds and five personal fouls in a win over the @entity32			0
in fact , @entity0 had never been a headline player			2
a journeyman with stops with @entity9 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , he 's known more for his defensive prowess and rebounding than his offensive output , having averaged 3.6 points per game over his 12 - year career			1
the warm reception he received during and after that game from his teammates , competitors like @entity49 and league officials reflects more on @entity0 ' reputation as a player and person around the league , as well as his historic announcement			2
" i know everyone in the @entity2 family is excited for him and proud that our league fosters an inclusive and respectful environment , " said @entity2 commissioner @entity59 after @entity0 ' signing last sunday			1
whether @entity0 stays around remains to be seen			2
at age 35 , he 's not bringing fresh legs to @entity9			1
and the team has no obligation to keep him on the roster			0
still , whether or not he 's a go - to player , @entity0 has very much become a symbol for the gay rights movement since disclosing his sexuality in an april column in @entity75			1
" i did n't set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major @entity4 team sport			0
but since i am , i 'm happy to start the conversation , " he wrote			0
" i wish i was n't the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying , ' i 'm different			0
' if i had my way , someone else would have already done this			0
nobody has , which is why i 'm raising my hand			0
" there 's no escaping the symbolism in his jersey number : he chose 98 in honor of @entity92 , the gay @entity93 student beaten to death in 1998			2
the news that the @entity9 jersey was selling so well ( despite the fact that @entity0 has n't even worn it yet , having at first donned a no. 46 for the @entity32 game ) struck a chord online			1
some on @entity101 praised the development , like one who wrote , " he 's a piece of history , and this is really significant for a lot of people			0
" many others , though , were less enthusiastic -- including some who used gay slurs and suggested @entity0 was profiting because he is gay			2
( in fact , @entity2 players do n't get more or less money based on how many of their jerseys are sold			0
) some questioned why @entity0 was being held out as an icon while , in their view , athletes who publicly profess their @entity117 are criticized			0
a few people questioned the jersey sales not because of @entity0 ' sexuality , but because of what they considered his sub-par play			2
" @entity0 ' jersey was actually a top - seller ? " tweeted one			1
" wow ... i mean i 'm glad he came out and all but # @entity129			0

@entity2 *veteran* @entity0 announced last april that he was gay
after being out of work all *season* , he recently signed with the @entity9
his @entity9 jersey is now the top - seller on the @entity2 's *website*
