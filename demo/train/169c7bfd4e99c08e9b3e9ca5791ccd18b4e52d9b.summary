-- i 'm finding it hard to get too worked up over the revelation that the @entity4 has been authorized by the secret @entity5 to collect all our call data from @entity8			1
has n't everyone already assumed this ? everything we do in the digital realm -- from surfing the web to sending an e-mail to conducting a credit card transaction to , yes , making a phone call -- creates a data trail			1
and if that trail exists , chances are someone is using it -- or will be soon enough			1
this particular style of privacy invasion looks a bit different from those old tv movies where @entity28 agents sit in a van listening in on phone calls and recording them on reel - to - reel tape recorders			2
the government is n't interested in the content of our phone calls -- our conversations -- so much as who is calling whom and when , or what has become known as metadata			2
your life and pursuits are less important than the statistical profile of the way you use your digital devices			1
this is the world of big data			2
i remember the days when talking about such possibilities was considered conspiracy theory or paranoia			2
many of us imagined a future in which people would be planted with chips that monitor our conversations and whereabouts			2
perhaps we 'd even accept such tagging voluntarily , if it meant being able to track down our children in the unlikely event of a kidnapping			1
what does the @entity8 order mean for me ? but such extraordinary measures proved unnecessary ; we 're all walking around with tracking devices in our pockets , which are capable not simply of broadcasting our phone calls , but our physical locations , our movements , our interests -- and then tying all this data to our consumer profiles , credit histories ... everything			1
yes , it 's still creepy , but it 's a different kind creepy than it appears			0
big data analysis works by identifying patterns and anomalies in our behavior			0
nobody cares about the reasons why certain people do certain things			0
they only need to be able to predict the future			0
marketers use big data profiling to predict who is about to get pregnant , who is likely to buy a new car , and who is about to change sexual orientations			0
that 's how they know what ads to send to whom			0
the @entity4 , meanwhile , wants to know who is likely to commit an act of terrorism -- and for this , they need us			1
the only way for them to identify the kinds of statistical anomalies that point to a terror candidate is to have a giant database of all those behavior patterns that do n't suggest imminent violence			1
what is different about the @entity116 brothers ' patterns of telephone usage from that of every other young male @entity120 immigrants ? you need both sets of data to figure that out			0
we are not the targets so much as the control group			1
opinion : the great privacy debate of course , that 's small comfort to a people who have long valued and assumed some measure of privacy from government observation			0
the @entity137 assumption of privacy allows those of us who do break certain laws -- say , smoking pot or engaging in prostitution -- from the fear of selective enforcement if we happen to be personal or political enemies of those in charge			1
as recent @entity150 scandals prove , our most trusted agencies are not above targeted investigations of ideological foes			0
the harder truth to accept is that we are moving into a digital reality where the assumption of privacy must be exchanged for an assumption of observation			1
our telephone metadata is just the tip of the iceberg			0
sure , president @entity161 was quick to respond to the surprise discovery of his administration 's covert surveillance operation , promising @entity137 that the leaked document describes the full extent of this technological intrusion on our privacy			1
but this court order was already " top secret			0
" had it not been uncovered , its provisions would have been denied as well			0
my own friends in the digital telephony and networking industries have long told me about " splitters " at all major communications companies , through which every data signal can be observed and diverted			1
other technicians have told me about giant server farms in @entity183 and @entity184 , where all of our digital data -- including encrypted e-mails and phone calls -- are being stored			1
no , they do n't have the technological ability or legal authority to search this tremendous repository of data ( if it really exists )			0
but they may at some point in the future			0
besides , the lack of court orders authorizing a particular style of surveillance do n't stop any of this surveillance from happening			0
it simply makes any information collected inadmissible in a court of law			0
since the dawn of the @entity207 , i have always operated under the assumption that if the government or corporations have technological capability to do something , they are doing it -- whatever the laws we happen to know about might say			0
digital media are biased toward replication and storage			1
our digital photos practically upload and post themselves on @entity221 , and our most deleted e-mails tend to resurface when we least expect it			2
yes , everything you do in the digital realm may as well be broadcast on prime - time television and chiseled on the side of the @entity229			2
does this excuse our government 's behavior ? of course not			0
but the silver lining here is that this digital transparency cuts both ways			1
no sooner does the government win a court order to spy on us than the digital trail of that court order is discovered and leaked to the press			1
the government 's panicky surveillance of @entity247 reporters and disproportionate prosecution of @entity250 participants lay bare its own inability to contend with the transparency of digital communications			2
it is disheartening and disillusioning to realize that our government knows every digital thing we say or do			2
but now , at least we know they know			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity261 .			1

@entity261 : @entity4 collecting call records from @entity8 should not be surprising
he says we hand out vast amounts of personal info about ourselves via *smartphones*
he says @entity4 wants call info for database to help track terrorists , and we are control group
@entity261 : this activity cuts both ways : digital trail led to revelation leaked to press
