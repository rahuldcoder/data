-- adopting a fascist salute to celebrate a goal in any country would border on the provocative -- but to do it in a land where the scars of @entity8 's wartime occupation still run deep would appear to be professional suicide			1
so it has proved for @entity12 ' @entity11 , whose actions after scoring the winning goal against @entity14 on saturday so enraged @entity17 football officials that the former under - 19 captain has been barred from playing for the senior national team for life			1
" the action by the player to salute spectators with a @entity26 salute defies common sense , profoundly shows disrespect to all the victims of @entity26 atrocities and injures the peaceful and deeply human character of football , " said the @entity17 football federation			1
" the federation condemns unequivocally and categorically such actions			2
" @entity11 , who turned 20 last month and led @entity17 to the final of last year 's @entity36 in @entity37 , has denied having any knowledge of the significance of his actions			1
" i 'm not a racist -- no way , " he wrote on his @entity42 site			0
i would n't have done it if i knew it meant something like that			0
" as this weekend 's international break approaches , not to mention the many more that will follow , the tattooed youngster may be well advised to study his history			0
for despite the seven decades that have passed , many @entity17 still shudder when they recollect the 300,000 citizens who died as the @entity57 controlled mainland @entity17 between 1941 and 1944			2
this would have been the very first good reason for the midfielder to avoid celebrating his goal in the @entity63 in the style he did -- but unfortunately for him , there were several more			0
the recent financial crisis affecting his country has heralded a rise in popularity for the neo-fascist party @entity71 , one of @entity75 's most controversial -- and right - wing -- parties			2
having taken just 0.2 % in @entity17 's 2009 elections , the far right group 's campaign for the 2012 elections involved an aggressive anti-immigration stance , feeding upon the chronic financial anxiety of those suffering from both unemployment and austerity measures			1
the campaigning stance was so successful it resulted in a significant 7 % of the vote -- and 18 seats in parliament			0
while many @entity17 are ashamed of @entity71 's burgeoning popularity -- and would never want to be associated with them in any way -- @entity11 ' actions came while playing for a club founded by immigrants in the 1920s			1
despite the furore , the midfielder has received support from his coach @entity97 , who -- as a @entity8 -- could have been forgiven for criticizing the footballer 's actions			0
" he is a young kid who does not have any political ideas			0
he most likely saw such a salute on the internet , or somewhere else , and did it without knowing what it means , " @entity97 said			0
" i am 100 % sure that @entity11 did not know what he did			2
he was crying in the dressing room seeing how the media reacted			0
he is young and needs protection			0
" @entity110 ' late goal was of great significance to both @entity12 and the club 's fans , given that the 2 - 1 win enabled one of @entity17 football 's traditional giants -- currently in a crisis -- to pull four points clear of the relegation zone			1
yet his celebration in front of the supporters in the @entity124 only served to alienate a section who had initially reveled in his onfield display			0
" there is no way we can forgive fascist salutes , " said influential supporters ' group -- original 21 -- in a statement directed at @entity134			2
" you are not welcome among us -- you are wanted ! we are not convinced by your tears or by your excuses			0
fascists and @entity57 do not belong in @entity12			2
" meanwhile , the @entity17 federation has told @entity0 that the ban on @entity141 only applies to internationals and has no bearing on his standing within his club			1
@entity12 , champions on 11 occasions but whose stock has mirrored the @entity17 economy 's by plummeting in recent years , have asked the player to explain his actions on wednesday -- the same day @entity63 officials are set to discuss the case			1
in 2005 , @entity157 striker @entity156 was handed a one - match ban by @entity160 football authorities after making a fascist salute towards his club 's fans during a game against @entity165			1
@entity17 media has reported that @entity11 has been given time off by the club in order to visit his wife in @entity160 since the incident , with many reporting that his @entity12 future is in doubt			1
just seven months into a four - year contract signed last august , the fortunes of a youngster who rose to prominence after impressing at @entity178 have been derailed for the most unlikely of reasons .			1

@entity11 barred for life from senior @entity17 national team after fascist salute
20 - year - old says he did not know the meaning of his actions
