-- days after allegedly causing death and devastation at the finish line of the @entity4 , two brothers " spontaneously " decided to head to a new place to unleash terror -- @entity10 -- that city 's mayor said			1
@entity13 , the surviving suspect in the @entity15 bombings , told investigators that he and his brother decided to bomb @entity18 as they talked the night of april 18 in a @entity19 they 'd just carjacked , @entity12 @entity11 said			1
the 19 - year - old initially told investigators from a @entity15 hospital bed that he and his brother , @entity22 , had talked about going to @entity10 to " party			1
" then he offered a new account during a second round of questioning sunday evening into monday , during which @entity11 said @entity13 was " a lot more lucid " than the first time he was interviewed			1
the brothers had five pipe bombs and a " pressure - cooker bomb " -- the latter similar to the bombs used in the @entity15 blasts -- with them in the suv that they could have used in @entity10 , @entity11 said			1
instead , their plan " fell apart " when the suv ran low on fuel in the @entity15 area and the @entity38 ordered the driver to pull into a gas station , @entity11 said			1
the driver escaped during the refueling , he said , and police subsequently caught up with the @entity38 -- first in a shootout after which 26 - year - old @entity22 died , then by capturing @entity45 on friday			0
" we do n't know that we would have been able to stop the terrorists had they arrived here from @entity15 , " mayor @entity46 said			1
" we 're just thankful that we did n't have to find out that answer			0
" rep. @entity51 , chairman of the @entity52 , said investigators believe the @entity15 bombing suspects were planning another attack " likely in the @entity15 area			1
" " the notion they decided to go to @entity10 was a rushed event after this thing unraveled on them , " the @entity57 @entity56 said			1
latest developments in the @entity15 bombings probe there is no evidence that @entity10 is currently a target of a terror attack stemming from the @entity15 bombings , @entity11 added			1
still , he said authorities are investigating two visits that the surviving suspect made to @entity10 last year			1
in one of those trips , in april 2012 , @entity13 is photographed in @entity18			2
official : @entity77 wars in @entity78 , @entity79 motivated bombings one person pictured in that picture was in federal custody thursday , as he 's been for the last six days , on alleged visa violations			2
this man , whom a federal law enforcement source said @entity13 shared a cell phone with , was originally detained last friday with another person when federal agents swarmed a residence thinking @entity13 might be inside , a federal law enforcement source said			2
neither of these two detained men -- both foreign exchange students from @entity94 at the @entity95 , where @entity13 also was enrolled -- has been linked to the @entity4 attack			2
yet investigators hope they can better piece together the suspected bombers ' movements before and after the marathon			0
" these guys are not being cut loose immediately , and there 's a reason why , " the federal law enforcement source said			0
sources : @entity106 raised concerns about mother , son while investigators continue to look into the @entity15 bombings , the killing of a @entity112 campus police officer and a violent chase and shootout in @entity115 , @entity116 -- all of which authorities have blamed on the @entity13 brothers -- the probe has also been focused some 5,500 miles away in the semi-autonomous @entity106 republic of @entity125			1
that 's where the suspects ' parents live and spoke to reporters thursday			0
their mother , @entity131 , told @entity0 's @entity132 that she did n't want to accept the reality of the bombing , saying it was fake			2
she has seen a video pushing the wild idea , she said , adding that there was no blood -- and that paint was used instead			0
photos : galleries from the attack and aftermath " that 's what i want to know , because everybody 's talking about it -- that this is a show , that 's what i want to know			0
that 's what i want to understand , " she said			0
but her disbelief broke down when she spoke of the victims			0
" i really feel sorry for all of them			0
really feel sorry for all of them , " she said , her voice cracking even as she remained resolute that her sons were not involved			0
while her husband @entity163 has said he plans to fly to the @entity77 -- though those plans may be in limbo after @entity131 said she called for an ambulance for him on thursday in @entity168 -- his wife is n't planning to join him			1
she 's wanted on 2012 felony charges of shoplifting and property damage in @entity116 , according to court officials			0
the family lived there before she jumped bail ; the parents moved the same year to @entity125			0
dead @entity15 bomb suspect posted video of jihadist , analysis shows a year before , @entity131 and her son @entity22 were both added by @entity77 authorities to the @entity185 , or @entity186 , database -- a collection of more than a half million names maintained by the @entity190 , an intelligence official said			1
that came as @entity106 raised concerns to @entity77 authorities about her and her son , sources told @entity0			1
@entity131 said the @entity197 had visited her family " several times " in 2011 with questions about @entity22 's " @entity202 interests			0
" a senior @entity77 official with direct knowledge of information from the @entity106 said that the case then " was extremely thin , " adding that @entity106 wanted @entity22 questioned to see if he and others had become " radicalized			1
" @entity77 authorities closed the case a few months after opening it			2
suspects ' mother describes her last conversation with her sons suspect 's widow is assisting investigation , lawyer says @entity217 : ' we were right ' @entity106 president @entity217 on thursday urged closer cooperation between other countries ' security services in the wake of the @entity15 attack " if we combine our efforts , we will not suffer blows like that , " he said during a live televised call - in session in @entity225 on thursday			1
the @entity229 are originally from the embattled @entity106 republic of @entity231 but fled from the brutal wars there in the 1990s			2
the two brothers were born in @entity235 and moved at different times to the @entity77			2
in his first on - camera comments since the bombing , @entity217 also lashed out against those in the @entity240 who have slammed @entity106 for human rights abuses in its actions toward @entity231			2
the truth about the @entity231 threat " @entity106 is among the first victims , and i hate it when our @entity248 partners call our terrorists -- who committed some heinous crimes in @entity106 -- when they call them freedom fighters and never call them terrorists			2
they supported them , " said @entity217 , accusing unnamed people or groups of providing @entity106 's foes with political , financial and " media " support			2
and @entity77 authorities have come under fire at home , with lawmakers asking if the @entity197 and @entity267 failed to share information			2
sources told @entity0 that @entity106 had separately asked the @entity197 and the @entity267 to look into @entity22 in 2011			1
sen. @entity270 , a @entity271 @entity56 , said thursday he believes " ultimate blame " for the attacks goes to the @entity273 administration			0
" the @entity197 and the @entity267 are , they have great people but , you know , we 're going backwards in national security			0
@entity281 and @entity15 to me are examples of us going backward , " he said			2
but a ranking @entity283 on a @entity52 intelligence subcommittee said thursday he does not see an intelligence - sharing failure			0
" this information was put in a database , it was shared among different agencies , it was shared with a joint terrorism task force , and that 's exactly what should happen , " @entity77 rep. @entity286 , @entity287 , told @entity0 , referring to the @entity186 database			1

rep. @entity307 , a @entity308 @entity283 and member of the @entity310 , said that the brothers used a remote control device similar to those used to guide toy cars			0
while video taken near the scene of the explosions shows @entity13 talking on a cell phone , it is not known whether he used it to trigger a device , a law enforcement official said			0
those twin blasts killed three people and injured more than 260 others , 14 of whom had limbs amputated			0
as of thursday evening , 34 of those wounded were still being treated at @entity15 hospitals , including one patient in critical condition			0
the manhunt for those responsible ended last friday , when @entity13 was captured after a tense standoff after he 'd hidden in a boat in the yard of a home in the @entity15 suburb of @entity115 , @entity116			1
