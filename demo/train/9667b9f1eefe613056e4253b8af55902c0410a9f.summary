-- a three - story museum and sanctuary dedicated to @entity3 near the @entity4 in @entity5 is the latest plan from a developer who failed to build his " ground zero " mosque amid local and national opposition more than three years ago			1
rather than the 15 - story , $ 100 million mosque and community center that raised such ire , developer @entity11 now plans a smaller , three - story museum and sanctuary at 45 - 51 @entity17 , to be designed by @entity19 - winning architect @entity18			1
" @entity5 's arts and cultural institutions have always been a great inspiration to me and i consider this opportunity to create a museum to be a true privilege , " @entity11 said in a statement released april 30 through his publicist , @entity21			1
" commissioning an architect of @entity18 's talent is a dream come true			2
" in 2010 , @entity11 faced opposition to his mosque proposal from some families of september 11 victims , anti-islamic activists and others who thought the mosque was to close to the @entity4			2
president @entity38 said he supported the right of @entity40 to build a house of worship on private property , adding that his support was not a comment on the " wisdom " of such a decision			0
@entity50 senate majority leader @entity49 and former @entity51 and " @entity52 " co-host @entity48 joined the debate , coming out against the site 's location			0
@entity11 tells @entity0 why he wanted to build the mosque although he did n't lay out a budget or timeline for construction , @entity11 's application to demolish the existing buildings at 45 @entity17 and 51 @entity17 were approved april 7 , a @entity58 spokesman confirmed			1
but the developer has n't filed the necessary paperwork for permits to start demolition , the spokesman said			0
@entity11 's news release did n't offer many specifics about what the museum will showcase , although " it will likely display rotating exhibitions of art and host academic and cultural events			0
" it 's not clear how much more opposition he might face three years later , but @entity11 has already taken at least one step to better negotiate the rough - and - tumble debate around @entity5 development : he 's hired veteran @entity5 publicist @entity21 to manage his communications .			0
