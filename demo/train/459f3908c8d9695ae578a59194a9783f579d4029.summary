-- imagine you served for one year with the @entity2 in @entity3			1
imagine you served an additional tour in @entity5 a year later			2
and imagine being injured in that last tour after a roadside bomb exploded from beneath a trashcan as your @entity9 rolled by			2
your buddy sitting next to you was killed			2
after you left the @entity2 and returned home , you had trouble focusing			2
you had headaches and issues with your vision			0
you realize you returned with what might be a @entity18			0
and maybe @entity19 , too			0
imagine you also have two kids younger than 7 who have n't seen you very much for the last half decade			0
imagine you 're struggling to find a job			0
you 've got a lot on your plate			0
and you 're understandably stressed			0
you do n't want to let down your family			0
and you do n't want to be viewed as weak or a wimp by your buddies			0
opinion : why women are less free after @entity3 you summon the courage to overcome the stigma , and you go to your local @entity32 to get some help			1
you file a claim for disability benefits to get the care and compensation you 've earned and the support you need to keep your family afloat financially			2
now imagine waiting 600 days before you get an answer from the @entity32			1
600 days of staring at your mailbox			1
600 days of phone calls to check in			1
600 days of bills piling up			1
sounds crazy , right ? well , for thousands of veterans nationwide , it 's real life			2
if you are a young vet who 's filed a claim with the @entity32 in @entity50 or @entity51 , you will wait an average of 600 days			1
and you 're not alone			0
more than 900,000 veterans of all generations are stuck in a bureaucratic logjam that , in 2013 , is the almost too absurd to believe			2
after 10 years of war , three @entity32 secretaries , and an increase in the overall department budget of 40 % since 2009 , an incredible 97 % of veteran 's claims are still on paper			1
@entity66 has soldiers in @entity69 piloting drones remotely that can strike a target thousands of miles and two continents away , but 97 % of our veterans ' benefits claims are still on paper			1
earlier this month , the @entity78 released a leaked internal @entity32 document that showed the entire world what veterans nationwide have known for years : the @entity32 backlog problem is even worse than reported			1
the @entity32 has reported that the average claim wait time was 273 days			1
for the first claim filed , it 's longer : 316 to 327 days			1
in @entity51 , that figure is 619			0
in @entity50 , it 's 642			0
in @entity90 , it 's 612 days			2
and vets with first - time claims in @entity93 , @entity69 , wait 681 days			1
the @entity32 has testified that it has hired 3,300 new claims processors , but it has failed to report that , because of staff turnover , the net increase in processors is only 300 since 2010			1
and , in @entity98 ; @entity99 , @entity100 ; and @entity101 , @entity102 , the overall number of claims processors has gone down			1
since the internal documents were leaked last week , we 've yet to see a public response from va secretary @entity108 or from the commander in chief			2
some 2.6 million men and woman answered the call to serve in @entity3 and @entity5			1
but now , a decade later , president @entity113 is not answering their calls for help			0
and the public still does n't seem to get it			0
that 's why this week i 'm joining veterans from across @entity66 as we take our stories to @entity123			1
@entity124 : why invading @entity3 was a terrible mistake veteran leaders from some 22 states are converging on the @entity128 to " @entity129 , " where we 'll be pressing elected officials to confront and solve the backlog			1
you can see their faces and read about their stories at the @entity137 website , @entity138			0
they are an amazing group of men and women ( and one dog ) that have overcome tremendous obstacles			0
and now , they 're taking on another one : the @entity32 backlog			1
just like we 've been trained , we wo n't quit until the job is done			0
no matter how long it takes , we 'll keep fighting			0
our brothers and sisters deserve support for their sacrifices			0
and every single @entity66 should stand with us to # @entity156 once and for all			0
ten years after the start of the @entity3 , there are a lot of folks who say they support the troops			1
now is the time for them to show it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			2

@entity167 : @entity5 , @entity3 veterans can wait 600 days or longer for claim response
he says after 10 years of war , 97 % of claims are still on paper , a logjam that hurts vets
he says @entity32 says it has hired processors , but high turnover keeps number low
@entity167 : veteran leaders in @entity123 to " @entity129 , " get officials to deal with backlog
