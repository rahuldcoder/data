-- the @entity1 guessing game is over			0
in the red corner , we have @entity5 and @entity6 , @entity8 's " comeback team			1
" in the blue corner , we have @entity10 and @entity11 , @entity8 's current team			2
let 's get ready to rumble			2
now that we know who the players are , the race is on to define @entity6			1
winning the contest of turning him into either a villain or hero could determine the election in several states , none more important than @entity24 , the big kid on the swing - state block			1
@entity6 has great potential , the potential to be an asset or a liability to the @entity31 ticket			1
how he affects the election in @entity24 depends primarily on two voting groups , seniors and @entity35			1
we just do n't know how he will play with those two groups			0
polls show that most @entity8 do n't know much about rep. @entity6			1
political junkies either love or hate the @entity41 , but average @entity8 are more likely to be conversant on the latest contestants on " @entity43 " than on the intricacies of @entity6 's budget proposal			1
the day after @entity6 's selection was unveiled , headlines in the major @entity24 papers predicted @entity6 could be a drag on the @entity31 ticket			1
the @entity5 campaign soon announced @entity6 would visit @entity24 this next weekend			1
@entity6 needs to clearly and unequivocally define himself			1
there will be a @entity53 battle waged in @entity24 , a state with one of the biggest senior populations in the country			1
democrats will say @entity6 will end @entity53 as we know it			1
republicans will say he is a courageous leader who offers a responsible solution to the inevitable bankruptcy of @entity53 and @entity62			1
i live in @entity24 and have seen this movie before			2
it usually involves scary robo - calls and political mailers targeting seniors			0
opinion : does @entity53 plan make sense ? while in @entity24 , he should also do @entity35 outreach			1
@entity74 do n't know @entity6 from @entity76 n. given the standing of the @entity31 brand with @entity74 , that may be a good thing			1
not being known is better than being disliked			0
soon after @entity6 was named , my inbox filled up with e-mails about his vote against the @entity85 , which would allow undocumented young people brought here as children to become legal under certain circumstances			2
this is a popular and emotion - laden measure among @entity74			0
@entity6 had also been an opponent of the @entity8 embargo against @entity92			1
this is a heresy for a dependable voting block of @entity96 - @entity8 republicans			0
yikes ! one of the negatives of a running mate with a long career in @entity101 is having to defend and explain an extensive voting record			0
this can be a challenge , but not an insurmountable one			0
though @entity6 voted against the @entity85 , he has not engaged in angry rhetoric towards immigrants or been a champion one way or another on immigration issues			1
he has not built his career by fanning anti-immigrant flames			0
many in @entity101 , including @entity114 , voted against the @entity85			0
however , that vote makes him the only one of the four names on the ballot to have cast a vote against it			0
i do n't know , and i suspect others do n't either , if @entity6 supports some other legal recourse for undocumented students and adults			2
he should tell us if he does before @entity114 use his immigration votes to drive a wedge with the @entity35 community			1
yes , @entity6 voted in the past against the @entity96 embargo			2
he comes from the @entity131 , where the thought of selling farm goods to the island is appealing			0
his @entity96 - @entity8 colleagues from @entity136 , including congressmen @entity137 and @entity138 , say @entity6 had a genuine conversion after they sat down with him and explained the realities of the totalitarian @entity96 government			2
he has since then voted in favor of maintaining the embargo			0
@entity6 should explain his change of heart or risk @entity114 taking advantage of his past record to suppress the vote of @entity31 @entity96			1
opinion : why @entity6 ? @entity6 comes across as an articulate and earnest man of conviction and faith			2
he is a @entity153 who , unlike @entity5 , has no qualms speaking about his religious beliefs			0
the @entity5 campaign should allow him to speak directly and engage in a constructive debate			0
@entity6 is comfortable showing emotion , so let him			2
he is very good at speaking about policy , so let him			0
surprisingly , he stumbled out of the blocks in his first solo interview with @entity163 earlier this week			0
he gave fuzzy answers to questions about the @entity5 budget			0
he said , " we have n't run the numbers on that specific plan			0
" @entity170 , run the numbers now ! @entity6 is perceived as a numbers and ideas guy who can explain wonky concepts in lay terms			2
the expectations for him when discussing fiscal issues are high			0
there is no room for error			0
@entity6 can help win @entity24 and @entity74 , but only if he lets us get to know him before the @entity114 turn him into the monster underneath the bed			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2

@entity6 's effect in @entity24 depends mostly on seniors and @entity35 , says @entity186
during his visit to @entity24 this weekend , @entity6 needs to clearly define himself , she says
democrats and @entity31 will wage a @entity53 battle in @entity24 , she says
@entity197 : @entity6 needs to make his feelings about immigration and @entity92 explicit
