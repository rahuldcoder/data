@entity0 , @entity1 -- security guards outside the @entity5 's new offices here said thursday that they were empty and there was no one available to talk , but the building itself said plenty			1
the @entity5 's white flag , which had flown wednesday over the building , was lowered behind the walls of the compound , and a sign that had read " @entity15 of @entity16 " -- the name used by the group during its rule in @entity16 from 1996 - 2001 -- was nowhere to be seen			1

he announced on wednesday that @entity16 was pulling out of peace talks with the @entity5 and out of talks with the @entity20 about a long - term foreign military presence in his country after the planned departure next year of @entity34 military forces			1
though the peace process remains a priority , " the @entity16 government will never allow for an @entity16 peace process to be hijacked by the enemies of @entity16 for reaching their nefarious designs that they have failed to achieve on the battlefield of war in @entity16 , " said deputy foreign minister @entity35			2
the @entity16 government 's plans to negotiate this week with a @entity20 team in @entity48 were suspended " so that we could signal our serious displeasure about the breach of the written assurances given to us by the @entity20 government about the opening of the @entity5 office in @entity0 , " @entity35 said in a statement			1
" if the @entity5 office in @entity0 is brought back into compliance with the written assurances given to us by the @entity20 government , the @entity16 government will review its decision about @entity62 negotiations with the @entity20 " it was not clear thursday whether the changes to the building in @entity0 would suffice to coax @entity26 back to talks			1
his concerns came after the @entity5 claimed responsibility for the deaths of four @entity20 troops in a rocket attack on @entity71 , which led a member of the @entity73 to lambaste the @entity5			0
@entity74 : why @entity5 would talk as @entity20 withdrawal looms " they can not be trusted , " said rep. @entity76 , @entity77			0
" and even if they give their word on something you ca n't know for sure that will filter down			0
" @entity26 has a legitimate complaint , @entity76 said			1
" we are trying to legitimize the guys who are blowing up @entity20 and @entity16 in @entity16			0
" still , a senior @entity20 administration official told @entity2 on wednesday that peace talks between the @entity20 and the @entity5 will likely be held " in the next few days			2
" the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , did not say when such talks might take place			2
speaking wednesday in @entity94 , @entity20 president @entity93 said he was n't surprised by @entity26 's response			1
" we had anticipated that at the outset there were going to be some areas of friction , to put it mildly , in getting this thing off the ground , " @entity93 said			0
but he said that he believes @entity26 remains committed to political reconciliation , and that he needs to be			1
" we do n't expect that it will be easy , " @entity93 told reporters			0
" but we do think ultimately we 're going to need to see @entity16 talking to @entity16 about how they can move forward and end the cycle of violence so they can start actually building their country			0
" the @entity5 opened the @entity0 office with a promise to renounce international terrorism and commit to peace negotiations , conditions the @entity20 had set before it would support establishing the office as part of peace talks			2
the @entity5 were expected to raise the issue of a possible exchange of a captured @entity20 soldier for @entity5 prisoners being held at @entity123 " in the coming days " in @entity0 , @entity118 spokeswoman @entity117 said thursday			0
she told reporters that @entity20 officials were open to discussing the issue , but that no decisions had been made			0
" this has been on the table since about tuesday , " said col. @entity128 , a spokesman for the parents of sgt. @entity130 , 27 , who was captured in 2009			0
" anytime that there are discussions and negotiations that may lead to the freeing of their son , that is encouraging news , especially after not much encouraging news over the past four years			0
" @entity26 's decision on wednesday to suspend the talks came a day after @entity145 - led troops transferred security responsibility to @entity16 forces			1
