-- @entity1 was skeptical as she placed her first $ 5 bet			1
but she realized that all she had to lose was weight -- and a few bucks if the money did n't motivate her to get in shape			1
a friend 's success had inspired @entity1 to join @entity9 , a website that hosts private and public games where people can bet on their own weight loss			1
each game sets a goal , such as losing 4 % of your body weight , and users who reach that goal split the pot. @entity1 was 34 and weighed 342 pounds			1
she had struggled with obesity most of her life			2
in the ninth grade , she was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis , and doctors put her on prednisone			2
the steroid made it difficult for her to maintain a normal weight			1
but in 2004 , @entity1 had surgery to fix the colitis			1
" from there on out , i could n't blame anything but my poor habits			2
" shortly after her birthday in february 2013 , @entity1 decided that reaching 350 pounds would be " unacceptable			1
" the @entity39 , @entity38 , resident realized that her weight was holding her back from doing the things she wanted to do			1
she had been the heaviest person in her college classes , where she studied to become a physical therapist			1
and although family and friends never said anything outright , she noticed they did n't exactly try to set her up on dates			2
she avoided social situations and outdoor activities that might call attention to her size , and she worried about traveling because fitting in an airplane seat was difficult			0
" for weeks before i flew , that would be on my mind , " she said			0
after signing up for @entity9 , @entity1 made a plan			1
she threw out all the junk food in her house			0
she decided she would wake up 30 minutes early every morning to work out on her elliptical machine			0
then , at lunch , she would use the physical therapy equipment at her office to strength train			0
that way , if she wanted to go out with friends in the evening , she would n't miss a workout			0
upwave : do n't miss a workout with the one - minute workout challenge " i have never seen her so driven and persistent on a goal , " her friend @entity68 said			0
" i do n't know where that came from , but she chose a simple exercise regimen and diet style that worked well for her , and she just kept at it consistently			0
" @entity1 traded her morning bowl of cereal for a protein shake			1
she stopped frequenting fast - food places and instead used @entity82 to find lighter fare to cook at home			0
she now keeps to a 1,200 - calorie - a - day diet			0
" i 'm kind of an all - or - nothing person , " she said			0
" i ca n't ( just ) lean into things , or it does n't happen			0
" losing weight did happen			2
@entity1 loved the support she found from her group on @entity9 and signed up for two more games after the first one ended			1
over time , she upped her bets to $ 10 and then $ 50 as she gained confidence -- and lost 140 pounds			1
@entity1 's friend @entity94 has also lost 60 pounds using the site			1
looking back , @entity94 is amazed at how heavy she and @entity96 once were			0
but what she 's always loved about her friend is still there , @entity94 says			2
" i do n't believe @entity1 has changed as a person			1
she still laughs loud , dances crazy and screams at the wrong parts in horror movies			0
what has changed is the activities we do			0
it 's not always takeout pizza and two movies			2
we 'll go walk a couple of miles or play " just dance " before we go out to eat			0
" the friends are training for an upcoming @entity113 and helping each other maintain their slimmer figures			0
" we are holding each other accountable , " @entity94 said			0
" my biggest fear was ( @entity1 ) having a heart attack at age 45			1
that fear is gone , and i do n't want it back			0
... it 's never going to be easy , but it will be easier than losing her at a young age			2
" overall , @entity1 has won more than $ 330 on @entity9			1
she 's also won a new outlook on life			1
@entity1 used to tell her friends -- and herself -- that she did n't like basketball because she knew she would n't fit into the arena seats			1
now she 's a @entity130 fan			2
" turns out , i really like basketball , " she said with a laugh			0
@entity1 is also traveling more			1
she loves dressing in clothes she feels express her style instead of trying to hide in the background			0
" i 'm finding me more , and that 's a really neat thing			2

at her heaviest , @entity1 weighed 342 pounds
@entity1 joined @entity9 and bet money she *'d* lose weight
she 's lost 140 pounds and won more than $ 330
