you 're just experiencing a normal wait			0
agency cuts have not yet taken effect , but stick around			2
@entity9 says you 'll be experiencing longer wait times in coming weeks and months -- the result of furloughs , overtime cuts and a hiring freeze			1
but if you 're on the customs line at @entity22 's @entity21 airport , @entity23 or a few others , you , indeed , are feeling the first impacts of the spending cuts on the aviation system			1
@entity29 airport had approximately 56 flights with wait times in the arrival area of customs exceeding two hours and 14 flights experiencing related waits of more than three hours , according to @entity36 , a spokeswoman for @entity37 and @entity38			1
@entity23 had 51 flights reporting waits at customs exceeding two hours and four flights approaching or topping three hours			0
" these wait times are not typical for this time period and are related to decreased booth staffing , " @entity43 wrote to @entity0			1
cuts in overtime forced the customs agency to close several booths and the situation will worsen after furlough notices go out on march 7 , she said			2
more than $ 85 billion in automatic , government - wide spending cuts took effect on friday night			1
the @entity57 administration said the so - called sequester would hit air travel , particularly hard , through cuts in spending on air traffic control and security			1
homeland security secretary @entity64 said on monday the airport lines this weekend were just the tip of the iceberg			0
" we will see these effects cascade over the next week , " she said			0
" i do n't mean to scare , i mean to inform			0
if you 're traveling , get to the airport earlier than you otherwise would			0
there 's only so much we can do with personnel , " @entity72 said			0
" and please , do n't yell at the customs officers or the @entity9 officers			2
they 're not responsible for sequester			0
" @entity72 said she expects wait times to double in some cases , if the cuts continue for the next several months			1
" there 's very little we can do to mitigate it because the procedures we use to clear passengers and cargo , they 're responsible i think for the fact that we have a very safe aviation system and we have a very good land migration system where we know who 's coming into the country , " she said			0
" so , we 're not going to cut back on those security needs so the end result is fewer people doing the same thing means lines are going to get longer			2
" the @entity9 said a hiring freeze will take effect in april			2
that will result in an additional 1,000 screener vacancies by @entity106 weekend and up to 2,600 vacancies by september 30 , the end of the fiscal year			0
the @entity9 has approximately 50,000 screeners			0
" with @entity9 staffing levels decreasing over time , we expect that during busy travel periods wait times exceeding 30 - 40 minutes could double at nearly all of the largest airports , " the @entity9 said in a statement			1
" in addition , passengers who schedule their travel outside of peak flight schedules and plan to arrive close to their scheduled flight time may see their wait times reach 30 minutes or more , " the @entity9 said			1
the @entity123 said on monday that there were " no immediate impacts " from spending cuts			1
