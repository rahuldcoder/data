-- @entity2 politicians on thursday called for a sweeping new federal law that would require all internet providers and operators of millions of @entity7 access points , even hotels , local coffee shops , and home users , to keep records about users for two years to aid police investigations			1
@entity15 sen. @entity14 of @entity16 , supporter of a bill that would require internet user records to be saved for police			1
the legislation , which echoes a measure proposed by one of their @entity24 colleagues three years ago , would impose unprecedented data retention requirements on a broad swath of internet access providers and is certain to draw fire from businesses and privacy advocates			1
" while the @entity33 has generated many positive changes in the way we communicate and do business , its limitless nature offers anonymity that has opened the door to criminals looking to harm innocent children , " @entity15 sen. @entity14 , a @entity16 @entity2 , said at a press conference on thursday			1
" keeping our children safe requires cooperation on the local , state , federal , and family level			2
" joining @entity14 was @entity16 rep. @entity47 , the senior @entity2 on the @entity48 , and @entity16 attorney general @entity49 , who said such a measure would let " law enforcement stay ahead of the criminals			1
" two bills have been introduced so far -- @entity54 in the @entity55 and @entity56 in the @entity48			0
each of the companion bills is titled " @entity61 's @entity60 , " or @entity59			0
each contains the same language : " a provider of an electronic communication service or remote computing service shall retain for a period of at least two years all records or other information pertaining to the identity of a user of a temporarily assigned network address the service assigns to that user			1
" translated , the @entity59 applies not just to @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , and so on -- but also to the tens of millions of homes with @entity7 access points or wired routers that use the standard method of dynamically assigning temporary addresses			1
( that method is called @entity84 , or @entity84			0
) " everyone has to keep such information , " says @entity85 , a partner at the @entity87 law firm in @entity88 who specializes in this area of electronic privacy law			1
the legal definition of electronic communication service is " any service which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic communications			2
" the @entity102 's position is that any service " that provides others with means of communicating electronically " qualifies			0
that sweeps in not just public @entity7 access points , but password - protected ones too , and applies to individuals , small businesses , large corporations , libraries , schools , universities , and even government agencies			1
@entity117 services may be covered too			0
under the @entity59 , all of those would have to keep logs for at least two years			2
it " covers every employer that uses @entity84 for its network , " @entity85 said			0
" it covers @entity124 on airplanes -- hose little pico cells will have to store a lot of data for those in - the - air internet users			1
" in the @entity133 administration , attorney general @entity131 had called for a very similar proposal , saying that subscriber information and network data should be logged for two years			2
until @entity131 ' remarks in 2006 , the @entity133 administration had generally opposed laws requiring data retention , saying it had " serious reservations " about them			0
but after the @entity143 approved such a requirement for @entity33 , telephone and @entity117 providers , top administration officials began talking about the practice more favorably			1
after @entity131 left the @entity102 , the political will for data retention legislation seemed to ebb for a time , but then fbi director @entity151 resumed lobbying efforts last spring			0
this tends to be a bipartisan sentiment : attorney general @entity155 , a @entity156 , said in 1999 that " certain data must be retained by @entity158 for reasonable periods of time so that it can be accessible to law enforcement			2
" rep. @entity162 , the @entity24 chairman of the @entity48 , said that @entity164 proposals for data retention legislation " would be most welcome			0
" @entity47 , who sponsored the @entity48 version of the @entity59 , had previously introduced a one - year requirement as part of a law - and - order agenda in 2007			2
a 1996 federal law called the @entity171 regulates data preservation			1
it requires @entity33 providers to retain any " record " in their possession for 90 days " upon the request of a governmental entity			1
" because @entity33 addresses remain a relatively scarce commodity , @entity158 tend to allocate them to customers from a pool based on whether a computer is in use at the time			2
( two standard techniques used are the @entity84 and point - to - point protocol over ethernet			0
) in addition , internet providers are required by another federal law to report child pornography sightings to the @entity193 , which is in turn charged with forwarding that report to the appropriate police agency			1
the @entity59 is broader than just data retention			0
other portions add criminal penalties to other child pornography - related offenses , increase penalties for sexual exploitation of minors , and give the @entity164 an extra $ 30 million for the " @entity205			0
