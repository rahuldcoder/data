@entity0 , @entity1 -- political tensions in @entity1 exploded into a major outbreak of violence this week as police opened fire on anti-government protesters near @entity0			2
@entity1 's capital has been at standstill during the past few weeks as the protesters seek to unseat a leadership -- led by prime minister @entity13 -- they say is illegitimate and undemocratic			1
the demonstrators support @entity15 , who was prime minister from 2001 to 2006 , before he was ousted in a bloodless coup			1
after his removal , he continued to play a role in @entity1 politics -- even from outside of the @entity22 nation			0
what is the background to the current protests ? @entity13 declared a state of emergency on april 7 , hours after anti-government demonstrators ( known as " red shirts " for the clothes they wear ) stormed the country 's parliament			1
three days later , the deadliest clash in more than a decade between protesters ( in this case the red shirts ) and the military erupted , leading to the deaths of more than two dozen demonstrators and military forces			2
media and analysts in @entity1 say civil war may be looming , with another group called the " multi-colored shirts " emerging			0
they are displeased with the disruption caused by the red shirt protests			0
they are generally middle - class city dwellers			2
they are not pro- or anti-government , they simply want the government to shut down the reds to end the violence and interruptions to daily life			0
the red and multi-colored shirts have clashed in @entity58 , @entity0 's business and financial district			0
meanwhile , @entity1 's independent election commission has recommended the dissolution of @entity13 's @entity62 after accusing the party of accepting an $ 8 million campaign donation from a private company and mishandling funds allocated to it by the commission			1
the ruling still must be reviewed by the country 's attorney general 's office and its @entity72			0
a democrat party spokesman maintains the party has fully complied with all laws concerning the uses of funds during the election campaign and the party says it will fight the recommendation			0
have n't these protests been going on for a long time ? yes , @entity1 has been embroiled in political chaos for years and many here are growing weary with the instability			0
ever since @entity15 came to power , there have been protesters opposing his allegedly corrupt and autocratic rule			1
those protesters donned yellow shirts ( the color of the king ) and occupied the two main airports in @entity0 , until finally the @entity95 government was brought down by a court ruling			2
in revenge @entity15 's supporters copied the yellow shirt tactics and took to the streets in red shirts			1
why do the sides divide on colors ? it 's an easy way for them to create an identity			0
it all started with the yellow shirts wearing a color associated with monday , the day of the week that @entity1 's revered king was born on			0
that was designed to show their allegiance to the king , and more broadly the traditional elite which has dominated @entity1 politics for years			2
@entity15 's supporters then picked a color to distinguish themselves from the yellow - shirts			1
why are they arguing ? essentially this is a classic power struggle			0
it 's easy to portray this as simply rich against poor , but it is much more complicated than that , as illustrated by the fact that the reds ' leader is in fact a multi-billionaire			2
@entity15 rode to power by enacting populist policies which gained huge support from the rural poor			1
his radical approach ruffled a lot of feathers among the elite , who felt he was in danger of becoming too big for his boots , and could erode their position			0
the " civil society " also become concerned over allegations of corruption and his brutal war on drugs , which saw summary executions			0
he was also criticized for his heavy handed response to violence in the @entity150 - dominated south			2
finally the army decided to oust him in a coup , which had the backing of the aristocratic elite and much of the middle class , who were becoming uneasy with the cult of personality growing around @entity15			1
that set the stage for an embittered power struggle , between @entity15 loyalists and those loyal to the army , aristocracy and their traditional @entity62			1
what are the wider implications of the protests ? if the divisions in @entity1 ca n't be healed it could lead to a deteriorating security situation which would have wider implications for the region			0
@entity1 's relations with @entity175 are especially frosty since @entity15 was appointed economic adviser to @entity175 prime minister @entity177 the worst case scenario would see @entity175 drawn into the dispute , with @entity15 using the country as a political base , adding to the already considerable tensions on the border			1
so who is @entity15 ? visionary leader or venal despot : opinions vary , like the color of the shirts his supporters and detractors wear			1
if you sport red , you think @entity15 was the only prime minister to offer the rural poor a voice and real benefits ; if you wear yellow , you view him as akin to @entity196 : greedy , self - serving and dangerous			1
what is not in dispute is that he won two elections , was the only @entity1 prime minister to serve a full - term in office and is still hugely popular			1
but critics say he bought his support and was only in politics to help himself			0
what is he accused of ? in 2008 he was found guilty and sentenced in absentia to two years in prison for a land deal that enabled his wife to buy a valuable city plot for a fraction of its true value			0
the case currently being considered by the @entity215 relates to the transfer of shares in his communications company @entity218			1
the prosecution alleges he illegally transferred the shares to his family , who then sold them to the @entity224 government 's @entity222 without paying tax			2
the court will also rule on whether @entity15 's government implemented policies that benefited his businesses , including a low interest loan from the @entity1 government to the @entity233 government to buy equipment from @entity218 , a change in tax laws that benefited @entity218 and changes to satellite laws that helped @entity218 what does @entity15 's defense team say ? the defense team argues that neither @entity15 nor his wife owned the @entity218 shares while he was prime minister , selling them to their son before he took office			1
it was their son who decided to sell @entity218 to the @entity224			0
the defense also claims that the @entity249 -- which has led the investigation in this case -- was politically motivated , having been appointed after the coup that ousted @entity15 , and therefore was biased against him			1
how much money is at stake ? 76.6 billion baht ( about $ 2.3 billion )			0
that is the total value of his and his family 's assets that are currently frozen in @entity1			0
but there is speculation that he has a great deal more money elsewhere			0
why bother going after @entity15 when so many other @entity1 leaders have been perceived to be corrupt ? well , @entity1 certainly has had a checkered history			2
but current premier @entity13 is widely believed to be honest and free from any taint of corruption			1
he wants to give the country a fresh start by showing no one is above the rule of law and that means ensuring @entity15 is n't allowed to get away with his alleged corruption , even though he is in exile			1
however , many analysts say this case is not just about corruption , but more about @entity15 's challenge to the @entity1 political elite that has ruled for decades			1
the theory goes that @entity15 was dangerously popular and refused to submit to powerful factions in the army , privy council and aristocracy -- hence the 2006 coup and the lengthy efforts to shut him down			2
@entity2 producer @entity287 contributed to this report from @entity0			0

detractors say that as prime minister he was greedy , self - serving and dangerous
