-- finally , the @entity2 operating system is starting to catch up			1
@entity4 's web - based @entity3 went live tuesday , years after competitors @entity5 and @entity7 launched their own			1
the app store launch is in conjunction with the rollout of @entity4 's latest iteration of the @entity2 operating system ( @entity13 )			1
the version 7.5 update will roll out to existing @entity2 owners slowly to ensure there are no issues for users , according to the company			1
@entity13 adds over 500 tweaks and features to the @entity2 platform			2
the @entity3 web portal launches with over 30,000 apps in tow , an admirable enough number ( though still far behind its competitors )			1
apps are organized into one of 16 categories , and on the main page you can also browse by featured , free , top or new			0
games are a separate tab from apps , and they 're organized into one of 14 different categories			0
on an app or game page , you 've got what you 've come to expect from a web - based app market : the app icon , price , a rating , description , screenshots and reviews			1
after purchasing an app from the web store , you can choose to receive it on your @entity2 hardware via e-mail or text message			1
the update to @entity13 is free and completely optional , but we got a chance to check it out ahead of time and honestly , there 's little reason not to upgrade			2
in particular , the @entity60 adds some seriously cool social media integration to your contacts list , which is referred to as the @entity63			0
it also adds @entity66 sharing abilities and a @entity70 - like built - in app called @entity68 to the homescreen			0
if you 're a @entity71 , @entity72 or other @entity2 owner , you 'll receive an alert delivered @entity75 to your device when the update is prepped and ready to download			2
to check the status of your potential update , you can visit the " where 's my update " site , which is available starting today			0
you do , however , need pc or @entity86 connector software to install the update , but they 're available for free online ( details are available on the @entity91 )			0
a number of @entity13 - specific devices will also be released later this fall			0
