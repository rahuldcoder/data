-- they spend their days beside a dusty freeway scratching a living by selling an unusual roadside snack to passing motorists : barbecued mice on sticks			1
but when no cars are in sight and the trade in mice kebabs is slow , this group of childhood friends bring out their rudimentary guitars and put on an impromptu performance			1
and that 's how @entity17 , the @entity19 @entity18 - winning producer famous for his work with nomadic rockers @entity21 , came to unearth his latest music gem : the @entity24			1
two years ago , @entity17 embarked on a mission to discover hidden musical talent in @entity27 , just as he 'd done before with many other bands			0
however , after more than two weeks and over 2,000 kilometers of fruitless driving along bumpy tracks , @entity17 had found nothing			0
but his luck changed one evening when he spotted a young man strumming his battered guitar by a two - lane highway in rural @entity27			1
not thinking twice , the producer immediately did a u-turn , went up to the young man , named @entity39 , and asked him to play a song			0
what followed was a glorious moment , bathed in the flaming colors of the setting sun casting a soft orange glow in the evening air			0
" it will stay with me forever , " recalls @entity17			0
" the sun was going down and a group of around 20 children , ranging from toddlers to teenagers , had gathered around			0
@entity39 was so shy , the song was nearly inaudible			0
but when he hit the chorus , all of the kids joined in -- it was true surround sound			0
" i realized that i had stumbled on a micro hit , isolated on this one corner of this one stretch of road			0
" songs of love and faith that " micro hit " ended up on " he is # 1 , " the debut offering from the @entity67 released last year			0
the album , a joyous collection of 14 self - penned gospel songs combining uplifting harmonies with rhythmic guitar playing , was recorded entirely outdoors in just two days using @entity17 's portable studio			1
read this : 10 must - see @entity78 films but minus a few unexpected intrusions -- tiny spiders kept causing problems by finding their way into @entity17 's hard - drive -- recording on the clay ground next to the band members ' huts allowed the honesty and soulfulness of the performance to shine through , as well as a few unusual contributions from passing animals and local children			1
" in those situations that are outdoors there 's always variables , " explains @entity17			1
" @entity96 is always going to be present ; in this case children and animals were on the recording but sometimes the children and the animals contribute -- they tend to be very on time			0
" but while their songs have been described as echoing " mid- 20th century @entity19 gospel music , " the @entity24 had never even heard recordings in that genre			1
" there are a lot of parallel things on , but it 's not that they are influenced by @entity19 music , " says @entity17			1
" it 's quite different to that ; they 're playing the very music that were contributing factors or maybe even the source of @entity19 music			1
" tough existence @entity27 , a beautiful landlocked country in southern @entity78 , is one of the world 's poorest nations , ranking 170 out of 187 countries surveyed at the @entity122			1
living without electricity in a tiny village near the town of @entity126 , the @entity24 have defied adversity by making music together since they were children			1
completely self taught , they write their jubilant songs on homemade instruments -- from four - string guitars crafted from scrap metal to makeshift tin - can drums			2
read this : @entity138 rappers defy bullets but to make ends meet , they rely on standing by the highway almost around the clock trying to tempt travelers to buy their roasted mice			1
" it 's a very dangerous work , " says @entity17			2
" they 're hunting the mice themselves ; they clean them and then they boil them and grill them			2
they do all this work and maybe they will end up with one stick which will sell for the equivalent of somewhere between half a euro or a euro			2
it 's quite a tough existence			2
" giving voice to the unheard " he is # 1 " marked the first time an album had been released internationally in the language of @entity166 , a fact @entity17 describes as " unjust " and " absurd " and " mirroring society 's greater inequities			2
" " how can it be just that tens of thousands of ' artists ' from cities like @entity173 and @entity174 are given platforms , but entire countries are left voiceless globally ? " he asks			0
" when we listen to people sing in another language , we are forced to listen to what they mean rather than what they say			0
and when we listen to each other , there is a chance for understanding and empathy to grow			0
" remarkable to see late last month , the band broke new ground with their first - ever performance outside @entity27 , when they brought their authentic sounds to the world - renowned @entity195 in the @entity197			1
the band 's uplifting set , performed on their diy instruments , was one of the festival 's major highlights			1
" it was remarkable to see , " says @entity17			0
" having never even been on a stage before , never sung with amplified microphones before , to going all the way to really putting on a show , " he adds			0
" to see them perform it 's quite a unique thing			2
" @entity17 says the band 's success stems from their level of commitment and a lack of self - consciousness , a rare quality in today 's entertainment industry			1
" we 're so used to seeing people that are hyper conscious about how they appear and often times their volitions are filtered through a myriad of media influences that they have absorbed , " he says			0
" this is a very different thing ; this is something that 's more akin probably to music before the advent of television , " he adds			1
@entity17 says the band has already recorded its second album , which it is planning to release next year			2
he also says that he hopes to help them tour overseas again			0
but while he was very keen on hearing the band 's music , @entity17 was much more reluctant to sample a taste of their other line of work			1
" i am a vegetarian , " he says , when asked if he 'd tried the mice kebabs			2
" i have the perfect excuse			0
