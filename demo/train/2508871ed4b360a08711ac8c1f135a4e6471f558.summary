-- @entity1 vowed to put on a " fantastic show " at sunday 's @entity2 after ending @entity5 teammate @entity4 's dominance of qualifying			1
@entity8 has been criticized for becoming boring in recent years due to @entity10 's all - conquering @entity9 , but this season the @entity5 team has taken center stage following a raft of new rule changes			2
while @entity10 failed to make the final session on saturday -- the second time in three race weekends so far the four - time world champion has suffered such fate -- championship leader @entity1 and 2008 titleholder @entity4 lined up for a shootout in @entity21			1
it was the @entity23 who prevailed , denying @entity4 a third successive pole position after the @entity26 locked up his wheels on turn one as the last driver still out on the track			1
" we 're here to put on a great show , " @entity1 told reporters			0
" you could see some action tomorrow between us			0
hopefully not , but it 's very possible			0
" we owe it to the fans , to everybody , to put on a fantastic show , and that 's what we 'll do			0
" the quieter v6 engines being used this year have left many , including @entity8 's boss @entity45 , lamenting a lack of atmosphere			0
for the past three years , @entity48 has been one of the most tense dates on the calendar , following the civil unrest which forced the cancellation of the 2011 race			2
there were reports of peaceful protests outside of @entity58 on friday , but organizers were looking forward to a trouble - free celebration of the 10th anniversary of the event -- with the 57 - lap race to be held at night under lights for the first time			1
@entity10 has won the race for the past two years , but will start 10th on the grid after new teammate @entity68 dropped from third in qualifying thanks to a 10 - place penalty from last weekend 's grand prix in @entity72			1
@entity4 , who won at @entity73 after failing to finish the season - opener in @entity75 , will be ahead of @entity77 ' @entity76 and @entity79 's @entity78			2
@entity81 's @entity80 will start his 250th career gp in sixth behind @entity84 's @entity83 , whose teammate @entity85 -- a three - time @entity48 winner -- will be ninth			1
former @entity84 driver @entity86 will start seventh for @entity77 ahead of @entity81 rookie @entity88 .			0
