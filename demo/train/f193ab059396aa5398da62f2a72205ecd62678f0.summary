@entity0 , @entity1 -- when i was in the third grade , a classmate of mine died of leukemia			1
none of us knew he was sick , only that his mother had n't let him attend school in a while			1
more than 30 years later , i still remember the awful day my mom told me my friend had passed away			1
i made a card for his mother , and walked to their house to deliver it			1
she was too overcome to take any visitors , but thanked me and took the card			2
i can recall her broken up face when she shut the door			2
over time we lost touch , but during the holidays a couple of years ago , i stopped by her home to pay a visit			1
she recognized me right away , smiled and invited me in for a cup of coffee			2
and then , while hanging my jacket , she began to tremble and cry			2
so many years later , the sorrow was just under the surface			0
the experience left an indelible impression on me , one that i better understood after becoming a parent myself			0
it violates a natural order of life to bury your own child , and i am not sure the grief ever goes away			0
@entity42 : how you can help that 's the position 30,000 @entity45 parents found themselves in this summer			1
and , 600,000 more children may be buried before the end of the year			1
in just about any other place on @entity50 , those numbers would scream out from international headlines , but not here in @entity53			0
inside the @entity0 , a mass burial site sits within walking distance of the close cluster of tents			0
@entity58 took me to see the tiny burial site of her 1 - month old daughter , @entity63			0
it was nearly lost among all the other shallow , hastily dug graves			0
small sticks mark these raised plots of dirt with nothing else except bits of colored plastic trash stuck in the ground and blowing in the wind			0
there are no nameplates , no flowers and no reminders of their lives			0
misery in world 's largest refugee camp " she was perfectly healthy when she arrived , " @entity58 told me			1
they had left @entity45 in search of food and water , and felt relief when they finally reached the camp			1
it may have been contaminated water that caused little @entity63 's intractable diarrhea and vomiting or an overwhelming infection			1
pertussis or whooping cough is something they see quite often here			0
" and measles , " one of the doctors told me			0
many of these infections are wildly contagious , especially among the hundreds of thousands of unvaccinated kids in these camps			2
saving @entity108 from starvation as i stood and spoke to @entity58 , with all those tiny burial sites around us , i could n't help but think of my friend and his mother			1
i thought of that unnatural order of parents burying their children			1
i thought about @entity58 's lifelong grief			2
@entity58 dug the grave for her daughter by herself			0
