-- @entity1 had a good week			1
she seemed to be energized on a surprise appearance on @entity4 ' final episode of " @entity5			0
" " why do n't you take my place on the show ? " @entity4 joked			2
she gave a spirited speech at the annual conference of the @entity11 , insisting on the need to diminish economic inequality and to revive the @entity15 dream that hard work should produce economic mobility			0
" it 's at the heart of what i believe is the basic bargain of @entity15 : no matter who you are or where you come from if you work hard and play by the rules , you will have the opportunity to build a good life for yourself and your family			2
" although the former secretary of state has not yet thrown her name into the 2016 presidential campaign , a series of seemingly negative stories that unfolded recently have the potential to actually strengthen her case for running to become president of the @entity15			0
on the surface , the good news was not obvious			0
many observers logically saw the news in a different light			0
" as she takes clear steps toward her political future , " wrote @entity40 of @entity41 , " the echoes of the old days are making the most noise right now			0
" the hearings on @entity48 have excited @entity49 who are seeking to investigate what mistakes or wrongdoing she might have committed while serving as secretary			1
her critics have also been asking why the @entity55 did n't designate @entity56 , the group responsible for the kidnapping of nearly 300 @entity59 schoolgirls , as a terrorist organization			2
sen. @entity61 , one of the top @entity49 prospects , put on his teacher 's cap and said @entity65 deserved an " f " for her leadership at the @entity55			1
the hearings and the questions about foreign policy will serve as a reminder to @entity15 of the kind of tough political attacks @entity65 should expect if she runs			2
the piece in @entity76 written by @entity77 has also brought up memories of the nastier side of the late 1990s , when the scandal involving her relationship to the president almost brought down the @entity65 administration			1
the ongoing release of documents from president @entity65 's archive is also triggering more stories about @entity65 in the 1990s			1
6 major takeaways from @entity77 's @entity76 essay just to make matters more difficult , @entity92 's statements suggesting that @entity65 had suffered brain damage from a fall will trigger more discussions about whether she is physically up for the job			1
@entity92 stood by his statements this sunday on the talk shows			2
and @entity102 gov. @entity101 , who some think could be a possible candidate in 2016 , said on @entity0 that he was worried so many people speak of @entity65 as inevitable			1
" i think it 's off - putting to the average			0
voter , " he said			0
@entity109 : @entity92 's attack on @entity65 was clumsy but shrewd but all of this news , while certainly problematic , can work to her advantage			1
one of @entity1 's greatest assets is her resilience and ability to take on the toughest of political fights			1
by bringing back memories of the 1990s , many of these stories will also bring back discussions of how much @entity1 was able to endure			1
at a time when many @entity124 are frustrated with how congressional @entity49 have been able to stymie this administration , the personal and professional record of @entity1 -- both as first lady and in her subsequent roles as senator and secretary of state -- could look extremely good and offer an attractive model as @entity124 select a leader to guide their party through the partisan wars that are surely going to continue in the coming years			1
the stories about @entity77 and @entity65 's health will also help to humanize her in a way that few other events can do			1
after all , one of @entity1 's ongoing obstacles , including when she ran in 2008 , was her difficulty in conveying some of her personality and character to a public that often saw her almost as cold machine			1
the ways in which she endured the trials of her marriage and assaults on her personal character in the 1990s are sure to bring some sympathy from many @entity15 and , at a minimum , to give voters a better sense of who she is as a person			0
given how long @entity15 have been forced to suffer through the fierce partisan attacks of recent years they might have greater sympathy for what she endured several decades ago			0
as @entity163 looks forward to giving birth to her first child , @entity1 has talked more about the joys of parenthood and excitement of becoming a grandparent , also experiences that will make her more human to @entity15 voters			2
the turbulence over her record that takes place in the weeks ahead can help shake some of the sense of inevitability that surrounds her candidacy , which would not necessarily be a bad thing			0
after all the media , and to a large extent voters , tend to like someone who has to struggle to achieve victory			0
in 2008 , @entity184 's supporters seized on the fact that @entity65 was said to be the inevitable nominee and used that against her			1
@entity184 's supporters presented her as the candidacy of the status quo , while depicting him as the fighter and as the person struggling toward victory in an exciting contest			0
@entity65 responds to @entity92 , says @entity1 ' strong ' the attack on @entity65 and the questions that emerge about her candidacy in the coming weeks can remind voters that her journey is anything but an easy path to success and show her to be very much a fighter and survivor in this campaign			1
the @entity48 hearings in particular , when combined with others like those on the @entity209 , will further the perception that the @entity49 are an investigative party , obsessed with scandal and constantly seeking to find evidence against our leaders			1
the hearings can further tarnish the already badly damaged image of the @entity49			2
and there is nobody better able to play up this angle and take advantage of these party weaknesses than @entity1 , who was part of the @entity225 team that turned this image against the @entity49 in the late 1990s			1
@entity228 ' relationship with media still testy after all these years finally , it is good to get all of this out of the way so early , before she has even announced her candidacy			0
if there is one truism in @entity15 politics , it is that everything bad will get out eventually			0
it is always good to get bad news out of the way long before the game really gets going			0
it 's still the preseason in the presidential campaign of 2016			0
given the short attention span of many @entity15 , it is much better for all this to circulate now when most voters are not really paying attention and before any serious contest has even begun			0
taken together , this is why the bad news can actually be good for @entity1 if she is preparing to run			2
the onslaught of attacks and challenges might just be the reminder that @entity124 need -- that @entity1 is the person best qualified to handle this job .			2

@entity1 continues to attract big attention even though she has n't become a candidate
@entity263 says comments from @entity92 and an article by @entity77 may help @entity65
he says these *incidents* remind people of @entity1 's resilience during the 1990s
@entity263 : @entity49 comes across as the investigative party , and *empathy* goes to @entity65 's benefit
