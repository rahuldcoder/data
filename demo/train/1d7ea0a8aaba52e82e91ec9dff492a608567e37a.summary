@entity0 -- he 's the leader of the @entity3 , which runs the @entity5 hospitals where dozens of @entity7 veterans died waiting for simple medical screenings			1
yet in the six months that @entity1 has been reporting on these delays , @entity9 has been silent			2
and he has n't spoken out on the matter to any other news organization , either			0
early friday evening -- after this story appeared on @entity1 -- the @entity5 gave a response , via spokesman @entity15			2
he explained that the @entity5 's inspector general 's office ( referred to as @entity23 ) , which is probing the matter , " advised @entity5 against providing information that could potentially compromise their ongoing investigation at the @entity20 system			2
" " accordingly , @entity5 may not be able to respond with respect to specific inquiries that may fall within the bounds of the @entity23 investigation on this subject , " @entity15 said			2
" @entity5 will work with @entity23 to ensure that any information provided balances our need to keep the public informed with the obligation to preserve the integrity of the @entity23 's investigation			1
" we first began examining the delays in appointments and care for veterans last fall , and immediately reached out for an interview with @entity42 on november 12			2
our initial report on delays in care at @entity5 hospitals in @entity46 and @entity47 published a week later			1
since then , we 've submitted numerous written requests and last month we verbally requested an interview with @entity9 at an april 9 @entity51 hearing on the delays prompted in part by @entity1 's reporting			2
most recently , we started looking into the @entity5 , where sources told us that the hospital concocted an elaborate scheme to cover up long wait times there			1
the sources said more than 1,400 vets were placed on the purported secret list and that documents were shredded to hide the evidence			0
according to sources , at least 40 @entity7 veterans died waiting for care at the facility , many of whom were on the list			1
according to @entity1 's sources and documents , more than 120 veterans -- including the 40 in @entity5 -- have died , are dying or have suffered serious injuries waiting for care at @entity5 facilities			1
the @entity5 has acknowledged that 23 veterans have died as a result of delayed care in recent years			1
our requests for interviews with @entity80 officials were repeatedly denied , until finally the local top @entity5 officials in @entity5 agreed to an interview on tuesday -- nearly a week after our initial story aired on @entity1 's @entity84 and @entity1			1
the @entity80 officials told @entity1 tuesday they had never instructed their staff to create a secret list , or to maintain a secret list , or to shred any evidence , and they said they never issued any instructions about it to their staffs			1
they acknowledged an electronic waiting list for veterans but said there may have been confusion among their staff about how it worked			0
they admitted some patients on the waiting list have died , but that they said they do not know if those deaths were tied to delays			0
@entity1 's exclusive investigation quickly drew attention in @entity0 : on monday -- a day before the @entity5 officials agreed to speak to us -- president @entity105 announced he has called for an investigation into what has happened in @entity5			1
@entity9 issued a written statement thursday , announcing that the director of the @entity111 health care system and two others have been placed on administrative leave amid claims of a secret waiting list and claims that 40 - plus veterans died waiting for care			1
" we believe it is important to allow an independent , objective review to proceed , " @entity9 wrote			0
" ... these allegations , if true , are absolutely unacceptable and if the inspector general 's investigation substantiates these claims , swift and appropriate action will be taken			0
" still , @entity9 has refused all @entity1 requests for an interview			0
@entity9 has served as @entity5 secretary since 2009 , appointed by president @entity105 who hailed him as someone who " always stood on principle			0
" the former army chief of staff under the @entity134 administration earned high praise among @entity137 war critics for his testimony before the @entity139 one month before the @entity7 invasion into @entity137 , saying he believed " several hundred thousand troops " would be needed to keep order in a post-invasion @entity137			0
that was more than double the number of forces the @entity146 had estimated			0
" no one will ever doubt that this former @entity150 chief of staff has the courage to stand up for our troops and our veterans , " @entity105 said when he nominated @entity9 to the post			0
