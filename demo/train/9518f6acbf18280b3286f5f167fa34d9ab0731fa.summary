tuesday 's discovery of rockets hidden in a vacant @entity3 facility is the sort of evidence that @entity6 cites when it accuses @entity7 of using civilians and their institutions as shields in the ongoing @entity12 conflict			1
the rockets were found in a vacant school between two other @entity3 schools being used as shelters for 3,000 displaced @entity16 , the @entity3 said			2
it was the second such discovery at a vacant @entity3 school in @entity12 in a week			2
as suggestive as those discoveries are , @entity6 's claims that @entity7 uses civilians as human shields are difficult to prove in an active ground conflict , experts say			1
" it would be impossible at this point to say how much truth there is to the human shield argument , " said @entity25 of the @entity26			0
" that 's not going to be possible to do in the heat of the conflict			0
" it 's a war of perception possible or not , @entity6 prime minister @entity37 advanced the accusations earlier this week when asked to comment about the brutal conflict , whose death toll has clearly hit @entity16 harder			1
as of tuesday , at least 630 @entity16 had been killed and nearly 4,000 wounded ; some 70 % to 80 % of them are civilians , the @entity3 said			2
on the @entity6 side , 28 soldiers and two civilians have been killed in the same time frame			2
measuring such bloodshed is " very difficult because @entity7 is using them , @entity16 , as human shields , " @entity37 told @entity49			1
" we develop anti-missile systems to protect , we use anti-missile systems to protect our civilians			0
they use their civilians to protect their missiles			0
" those assertions are significant in the war of perception , which is unfolding in tandem with the conflict between @entity7 militants and @entity6 's military , @entity25 said			1
" there 's many different dimensions of this conflict at the same time , " @entity25 said			0
" civilian casualties on the @entity16 side are very high			1
that is something @entity7 can use in the court of public opinion			0
@entity6 has to have an answer to that : the civilian casualties are so high because of @entity7 , and this is their answer to that			1
" civic presence complicates things what complicates the dispute over alleged human shields -- an offense against international law -- is how @entity7 is also a political organization embedded in civilian life in the @entity16 territory , @entity16 leaders say			1
" @entity7 is a political party after all , not just a military wing			0
and it has institutions , organizations , homes " in @entity12 , said @entity91 , executive committee member of the @entity92 in the @entity93			0
that means @entity7 is more than its military wing , @entity91 said			0
its members are active in civilian society too			0
" several - story buildings were totally demolished and the people living there			0
how can you claim that @entity7 is hiding anything in there ? these are normal residential areas with no military or any munitions hidden there , " @entity91 said			0
" the question is that @entity6 is not discriminating , it is destroying the homes of people who are active ( in @entity7 )			1
now ' active ' could mean you belong to a social service institution			0
@entity7 has day - care centers , has schools , has hospitals ; it 's a political party as well			2
" @entity7 is not just an isolated , you know , sort of armed individuals			0
it belongs to a very pluralistic system			0
it has in @entity12 many services , offices and so on			0
and therefore if you are going to destroy everything related to @entity7 as a party , as a movement , it means that you 're going to go on the rampage against families , homes , hospitals , schools and social services , " @entity91 said			0
population plays a factor the geography and population density of @entity12 further clouds efforts to determine whether civilian casualties are part of @entity7 strategy of using human shields or collateral damage from @entity6 's ground and aerial assaults , @entity16 say			1
@entity12 , with a population of 1.8 million , is a rectangular tract about 25 miles long and just a few miles wide , bounded by the @entity147 on one side and @entity149 on another			2
a border blockade on @entity12 has been in effect for much of the past seven years			0
high unemployment and extensive poverty afflict the @entity16 territory			2
in such a place , it 's difficult for civilians to hide , @entity16 said			1
" the population of ( @entity12 ) -- 43 % of it is under the age of 14 , " said @entity158 , a human rights attorney who was a legal adviser to @entity16 negotiators			1
" it 's simply a fact that what the @entity6 are doing is they 're dropping bombs of a magnitude that we have never seen before on a captive civilian child population			1
" @entity6 said it strives to keep @entity170 out of harm 's way by warning them with leaflets , text messages and phone calls in advance of a military strike			2
@entity6 blames @entity7 ' aggression for putting @entity170 in danger			1
" they 're putting missile batteries next to hospitals , next to mosques , next to schools , " said @entity180 , @entity6 's ambassador to the @entity181			1
" they 're the ones who are putting their civilians in harm 's way			0
" they 're saying , ' ignore the warnings of the ( @entity194 ) , stay there , ' " @entity191 said			0
as a result , civilians can become exposed to an @entity6 strike			2
" they use the strategy of human shields for a reason because they think it works			1
they think that @entity6 will be ( blamed ) for these civilian casualties , " @entity191 said			2
" @entity7 should be responsible for the use of human shields			1
" casualties are inevitable @entity6 has accused @entity7 of using human shields in previous conflicts in @entity12			1
also , in 1982 , when @entity6 invaded @entity210 with the intention of destroying the @entity92 , it accused @entity92 combatants of using civilians as human shields in that conflict , too			1
" the problem with this particular crisis now is that it 's taking place at a time when the whole region from @entity224 in the east , to @entity226 in the west , from @entity228 in the north , to @entity230 in the south , is sliding towards hell , " said @entity216 , the @entity217 bureau chief for @entity218			0
" that 's one of the reasons , by the way , that you do n't see this @entity238 outcry , because the @entity238 themselves are trying to put out fires in their own countries			0
" one thing is clear about the ongoing warfare between @entity6 and @entity7 , said retired @entity181 gen. @entity244			1
fighting in such a confined space as @entity12 means civilian casualties			2
" it 's so tightly packed , " @entity244 said			0
" in the end , it 's the poor innocents that are suffering as a result of this			1
" what is @entity7 ' endgame in @entity12 ? what is @entity6 's endgame in @entity12 ?			1

active conflict makes it impossible to prove use of human shields in @entity12 , expert said
@entity6 said high civilian death toll is because @entity7 uses civilians as shields
@entity16 say @entity6 is bombing ' a captive civilian child population '
' it 's the poor innocents that are suffering ' retired @entity181 general says
