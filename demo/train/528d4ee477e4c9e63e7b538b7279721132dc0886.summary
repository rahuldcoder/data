@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 branch of the @entity4 said it was concerned that the basic rights of the children and mothers connected to a @entity1 polygamist ranch were violated during a recent raid and custody hearing			1
at the hearing friday , judge @entity12 ordered 416 children connected to the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) ranch kept in state custody			1
@entity18 made her ruling after two days of testimony at the hearing , which was aimed at determining whether child welfare authorities properly removed the children from the sect 's @entity1 ranch			1
the judge said she found sufficient evidence for @entity27 to retain custody of the children			1
the @entity4 said it had a representative at the court hearing and the organization was concerned about human rights violations			1
" while we acknowledge that @entity18 's task may be unprecedented in @entity1 judicial history , we question whether the current proceedings adequately protect the fundamental rights of the mothers and children , " @entity34 , executive director of the @entity4 of @entity1 , said in a written statement			1
" as this situation continues to unfold , we are concerned that the constitutional rights that all @entity46 rely upon and cherish -- that we are secure in our homes , that we may worship as we please and hold our places of worship sacred , and that we may be with our children absent evidence of imminent danger -- have been threatened , " @entity43 said			1
the group 's courtroom observer , @entity53 , added : " we recognize that this balancing act is difficult , but we are concerned that government may not be complying with the @entity57 or the laws of @entity1 in the execution of its mandate , from how the raids were conducted to whether the current process protects basic rights			2
" the @entity4 statement did not list any specific instances of human rights or constitutional violations , and @entity4 representatives did not immediately return calls seeking comment			1
@entity27 spokeswoman @entity72 said her department is in the process of finding " temporary placement " for all the children			2
" what we did was warranted and in the best interest of the children , " she said			2
" this is not about religion -- this is about keeping children safe from abuse			0
" the hearing stems from an april 4 raid of the ranch , which authorities said was triggered by phone calls in late march from a 16 - year - old officials referred to as @entity90			0
the caller said she had been beaten and forced to become a man 's " spiritual " wife			0
on thursday , child protection supervisor @entity94 testified that she and other investigators encountered several pregnant teenagers at the yfz ranch , which is in @entity99 , @entity1 , about 40 miles outside @entity0			0
the girls called each other " sister wives , " @entity94 said , and believed it was acceptable to be " spiritually united " with a man at any age			0
" it was the belief that no age was too young to be married , " she said			0
members of the ranch have denied the girl , supposedly named @entity110 , exists , and authorities have yet to find the caller			0
however , @entity113 are pursuing a @entity115 woman as a " person of interest " regarding the phone calls that touched off the raid			0
authorities on friday said a search of @entity122 's home in @entity123 resulted in evidence that possibly links her to phone calls made about the yfz ranch			2
@entity122 , 33 , has been charged in @entity115 with false reporting to authorities , but police said that the arrest was not directly related to the @entity1 case			0
