-- in his youth , @entity1 planned to enter the priesthood , so fervent was his devotion to @entity6			1
but these days , @entity7 is devoted to protecting a person 's right to ridicule , criticize -- even lambaste @entity6			1
@entity10 for a @entity11 was painted by @entity12			2
you might say he is a blasphemer 's savior			1
the devout @entity16 turned non-believer leads a movement that is all about protecting people 's rights to speak irreverently about religion			1
criticizing @entity6 is an act punishable by death in several nations			1
in @entity26 , blasphemy laws remain on the books in six states , though they are largely arcane and not enforced			2
but everywhere , it seems to @entity7 , scoffing at @entity6 is not socially acceptable			1
people are willing to tolerate the harshest statements about the president of the @entity26 , he said			2
but talk about @entity34 or @entity35 -- that 's a whole different ball game			1
" we think religious beliefs should be subject to examination and criticism just as political beliefs are , " said @entity7 , 56 , who heads the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 , an organization that claims about 100,000 followers worldwide			2
" but we have a taboo on religion			2
" outraged by nations that want to execute blasphemers and propelled by a deep belief in the freedom of expression , @entity7 is forging ahead with his " nothing is sacred " movement			2
wednesday marks the first organized observance of @entity58 , a series of events , exhibits and lectures unfolding in a host of mostly @entity65 cities that are part of a larger @entity67			1
the day coincides with the fifth anniversary of a @entity71 newspaper 's publication of controversial cartoons about @entity35			1
the depictions of the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse sparked protests by @entity79 worldwide and prompted media outlets to censor themselves			2
but to @entity7 , a society is not truly free unless people can freely air their views on any subject -- including @entity6			1
the @entity85 , when asked about the day on wednesday , declined to comment			1
@entity58 even includes a contest that invites participants to come up with slogans that might be judged blasphemous by society			1
and , yes , the winner gets a t - shirt heralding the prized slogan			2
@entity7 offered this sample : " there 's nothing wrong with @entity6 that a dose of reality wo n't cure			1
" some of the entries are so crude they ca n't be published by @entity0			0
but since the @entity37 is all about freedom of expression , it ca n't reject any of them			0
@entity7 has made it clear that expletive - ridden , crass slogans are not the type of entry that is destined to win , but he makes no apologies for statements that might offend a devout person 's sensitivities			1
neither does artist @entity12 , 38 , of @entity113 , who is showing her provocative paintings of @entity6 and religion in a special @entity58 show wednesday evening			1
@entity12 grew up as a non-believer but later studied religion on her own to understand it			0
after all , she said , it 's such an important part of society			2
she found the concept of faith fascinating			0
it was an unknown to her			0
she painted a scene from @entity125 with a black child sitting under the table			0
how did the races evolve , her art asks those who believed in the @entity132 tale ? she portrayed @entity34 painting his crucifixion nails after she noticed a church group using space next to a nail salon in a shopping mall stung by recession			0
she said she realizes her work makes people uncomfortable , though her intent is not to disrespect			0
" even to say , ' i do n't believe in @entity6 ' is enough to knock someone out of their chair and then to see it in a picture ... i 've had a lot of hate come my way			1
" and even though she does n't believe in hell , she feels a bit uneasy hearing that she is going straight to it			0
" i am in no way trying to be a poster child for atheism , " @entity12 said			0
" but i do n't want to be punished for not believing in @entity6			1
" @entity12 said she never means to harm anyone , so she finds it frightening that someone could be punished -- or lose their life -- over remarks or actions considered blasphemous			1
an @entity164 student journalist was sentenced to death for distributing a paper that allegedly blasphemed @entity167			0
a @entity169 schoolteacher spent time in a @entity171 jail after she allowed her students to name teddy bears after @entity35			0
these are cases that worry @entity7 and the members of his organization			0
he is most distressed by the @entity180 considering next month a binding resolution on the defamation of religion			0
all this did not come easy to @entity7 , the son of @entity16 parents who bared his soul in a confession booth each week			0
later , he studied religion and philosophy in at @entity192			0
the more he read , the more he questioned beliefs that had been ingrained from childhood			0
slowly , the would - be - priest turned into an atheist lawyer -- and a 21st - century defender of time - worn sacrilege .			0
