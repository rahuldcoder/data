according to the @entity4 page , the drinking jacket features a bottle opener zipper , both a hidden flask and neoprene koozie pockets , drinking mitts , and a sunglasses holder -- we presume to deal with the potential hangover ( @entity17 not included )			2
there is also a pocket specifically for the @entity20 and money needed for a night of bar hopping			0
the jacket is the brainchild of @entity26 , executive producer and host of " @entity28 , " a fan - funded television show about , you guessed it , drinking			1
a pledge of $ 85 or more secures the @entity1 , while those needing a tall size or a big and tall will have to ante up $ 90 and $ 95 respectively			0
for the big spenders , a pledge of $ 1000 or more includes two jackets , two travel flasks and two tickets to both a dinner and a vip party hosted by @entity26			1
