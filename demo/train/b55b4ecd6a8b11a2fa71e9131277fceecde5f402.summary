@entity0 , @entity1 -- she never displayed the boundless energy of other children -- all she seemed to do was cry			1
her mother could n't figure out why until a doctor examined her baby girl and broke the news			2
she had a heart condition that would eventually kill her if left untreated			1
doctors said surgery should be done when she turned one but there was no one able to do it in her home town			1
the family did not have the money to go elsewhere			0
the longer she waited , the worse her daughter would get			0
then something happened that changed everything			0
@entity25 broke out in @entity26 and eventually spread to their town			1
they tried to wait it out but it raged on with non-stop ferocity			0
escape from ruins then six months ago , the girl and her mother escaped what was left of their home			1
but they could not escape their child 's medical problems			0
the girl had turned four and her condition was getting worse -- as doctors predicted			1
" she could not play or walk or talk			0
she could not indulge in anything , " her mother said			0
" she could only eat very little			0
" the child 's mother asked us to keep their identity secret because of what happened after they left @entity26			1
their journey eventually landed them in @entity1 , which is technically still at war with @entity26 and has been for decades			1
the family worries they will be seen as traitors or spies when they return to their homeland if their neighbors find out they 've been inside the " enemy state			0
" but the family acknowledge their journey to @entity1 saved the girl 's life			1
oxygen starved their perilous journey from @entity26 first landed them in a refugee camp with hundreds of thousands of others			2
desperate and dirty , the camp was no place for a sickly child whose heart condition was slowly but surely starving her of oxygen			1
" we all have in the heart two pumps but she has only one that is working , " explained dr. @entity83 , the head of the @entity84 at the @entity85 in @entity0 , @entity1			1
" we have two tubes in our body -- one going to the lung , one going to the body			0
the one going to the lung was severely narrowed			0
" dr. @entity83 is from an organization called " @entity100			1
" founded in @entity1 in 1995 by another surgeon at the @entity85 , the non-profit organization 's mission is to provide heart surgery to children wherever they are			1
so far they have treated 3,200 children from 44 nations			2
last week they added another nation to their list , @entity26			2
the civil war across the border sent them a child in need they would probably never been able to help due to the breakdown in relations between the two neighbors			2
when @entity100 heard about the little girl 's plight , they jumped through all the necessary security hoops to get her the treatment she badly needed			1
bridge stereotypes " we hope that we can contribute in our small way first and foremost to the medical care to the children in our neighborhood			2
we also believe that this has the ability to bring people closer together to bridge stereotypes , " said @entity133 , the executive director of @entity100			2
while the treatment is free for the patients , the organization relies on donations to pay the bills that invariably need to be settled			1
a team of doctors and nurses at the @entity85 performed open - heart surgery on the girl			1
though it was a major operation , doctors say it is a relatively simple procedure that often produces amazingly fast results			0
" you can see differences that are absolutely crazy			0
kids that were thought to be retarded all of a sudden start talking and walking , all they needed was a little bit of oxygen , " dr. @entity83 added			0
healthy child we met the little girl three days after surgery			2
her curly hair , big brown eyes and huge smile captivated everyone around her			0
she was playing with bright colored plastic toys strewn alongside her bed			0
though still hooked up to a machine , she acted like any typical four - year old , rather than the sickly , constantly exhausted child she was until very recently			1
" thank @entity174 , thank @entity174 , my daughter has recovered			0
she is so much better than before , " her mother explained			0
she had been worried about how she would be treated -- like so many others who have come to the hospital from far afield			2
at the moment there are young heart patients being treated from the @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186			0
as for the little @entity26 girl who has survived a war and now open - heart surgery , she will need one more operation in about a year 's time as her body grows			1
as she sits on the bed recovering from surgery , the little girl begins to sing a lullaby asking @entity174 to protect her baby brother			2
it turns out she was the one who needed protection the most			0
the mere fact the wide - eyed infant is able to sing easily without losing her breath is evidence enough to give her mother a sense of hope she has n't felt since before her country was plunged into war .			1

four - year - old girl with heart condition forced to flee home in @entity26
the infant required treatment outside of her war - torn country
she eventually found a hospital willing to perform surgery in neighboring @entity1
@entity100 organization works to give children heart surgery for free
