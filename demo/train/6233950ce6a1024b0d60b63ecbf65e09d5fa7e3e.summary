-- it was a foggy winter 's night on the remote @entity2 in @entity3 when its head groom @entity4 heard a knock at the door			2
what lurked outside was to spark one of the most extraordinary unsolved kidnappings of the @entity10			0
thirty years ago this week -- on february 8 , 1983 -- @entity4 was confronted by three masked gunmen			1
they had come for @entity13 -- then the most valuable race horse in the world and the pride of a nation			1
" @entity13 was the best race horse in the world , owned by the richest man in the world			1
it was the most sensational sports story of all time , " racing commentator @entity22 told @entity0			0
a horse kidnapped ? nothing like this had ever happened before			2
" the retired champion race horse , owned by billionaire businessman the @entity30 , was worth a staggering £ 10 million ( $ 16 million ) -- around £ 28 million ( $ 44 million ) by today 's standards			1
were @entity13 here today , he would be the ninth-most valuable athlete in the world , just ahead of @entity35 's prized footballer @entity34 on $ 42.5 million			1
the five - year - old breeding stallion , who had mated with 35 mares in his first season , was set to be worth millions in the coming years with owners paying up to £ 80,000 ( $ 126,000 ) for his highly sought - after offspring			1
this , after all , was the champion colt who two years earlier annihilated the field at @entity47 's prestigious @entity46 , winning by 10 lengths -- the biggest margin in the race 's 226 - year history			1
for racing - mad @entity3 , @entity13 was the darling of a nation in turmoil during the darkest days of " the @entity55 , " with violence between nationalists and unionists in the north as they vied for political power			2
the bandits demanded £ 2 million ( $ 3 million ) for @entity13 and conspiracy theories abounded , with the @entity63 and the @entity65 's @entity64 linked to the thoroughbred 's kidnapping			1
but the most popular accused culprit remains the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) , whom the @entity30 and his syndicate of owners officially blamed for the kidnap , though authorities have never named a suspect			1
while the @entity69 , which has disbanded , took responsibility for a number of attacks over the years , it never claimed to have kidnapped @entity13			1
back at @entity2 on that fateful night , the stallion with a distinctive white blaze on his face and four white " socks " was loaded into a horse box never to be seen again			2
father - of - six @entity4 was bundled into a car and driven around for hours before being dumped a few miles from home			0
he was warned not to call the police			0
then a series of mismanaged calls ensured almost eight hours elapsed before police were alerted			0
hampering their investigation was the clever timing of the kidnapping -- it was the day before @entity3 's major @entity98 's racehorse sale and roads were filled with horse boxes identical to @entity13 's			1
the kidnappers demanded negotiations through three horse racing journalists at the time -- @entity105 , @entity106 , and then 32 - year - old television presenter @entity22			2
" we were taken to the @entity108 , whose claim to fame was that it was the most bombed hotel in @entity113 , " @entity22 said			0
" do n't forget , this was 1983 at the height of the ' troubles ' and @entity117 was one of the most dangerous cities in the world			2
" at the hotel , which still had cracked windows from a previous bombing , @entity22 got a call from the kidnappers telling him he was being watched from across the road			0
he was told to go to a deserted farmhouse 30 miles away for negotiations			0
there , @entity22 said he received eight phone calls from the kidnappers over eight hours			0
each call lasted around 60 seconds , but the police needed at least 90 seconds to trace the call			0
" when the last call came at 1.30 a.m. i managed to keep him talking for one minute and 35 seconds , " @entity22 said			0
" i thought , ' that 's it , we 've got him , ' but the police told me ' sorry mr. @entity22 , the man who does the tracing goes off duty at midnight			2
' " that was the best chance we had of catching them and it was gone			0
" @entity13 was owned by a syndicate of 34 people , each with a share worth £ 250,000 ( $ 394,000 )			1
the syndicate refused to pay the ransom , fearing it would encourage other kidnappings			0
" the following monday we received a call saying the horse had had an accident and was dead			0
that was the last time we heard from them , " @entity22 said			0
@entity22 believes the @entity69 was responsible , pointing to evidence in former member @entity160 's 1999 autobiography " @entity161			1
" " every time i took a call from the kidnapper i used a different code word -- the name of a famous race horse -- so i would know it was the same guy calling back , " @entity22 said			1
" but there was always one name i kept to myself , i never told anyone else , and when i read @entity160 's book it was there			0
that really shook me to the core			0
" jockey @entity176 , who as a 19 - year - old rode @entity13 to that historic @entity46 win , said the kidnapping had a profound effect on tightening racing industry security			1
" @entity13 's stable was very impressive but anybody could have walked into it , " he said			1
" today it 's more like a padded cell , they ca n't afford for the horse to get injured , with @entity188 and a large number of grooms			2
" the thoroughbred has since been immortalized in @entity193 's annual @entity192 and the 1999 film " @entity13 " starring @entity195			1
@entity196 regrets that @entity13 's achievements on the track will always be overshadowed by his dramatic abduction			2
but the image of him pounding over the hill at @entity46 , his seemingly tiny competitors trailing behind , lives on .			0

thirty years after " world 's greatest " race horse was stolen , his *legend* lives on
@entity13 was kidnapped from @entity209 stud farm , but was never found
the £ 10 million stallion was owned by billionaire @entity212 leader @entity30
@entity69 was *widely* accused of kidnapping but was never charged
