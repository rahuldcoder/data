-- they distrust government and the justice system as well as @entity5 's political elite			1
they rail against multiculturalism and believe their national identity is being swamped by immigration and their culture strangled by @entity14			1
they are implacably hostile to " big money " -- banks and other financial institutions			0
they are getting organized , online and off , and thriving amid @entity5 's eurozone crisis			1
" they " are populist groups and parties from @entity23 to @entity24			1
some compete in elections with growing success , picking up protest votes that yield seats in government and the @entity32			1
others are street movements like the @entity35 and @entity36 in @entity37 that eschew the political process			2
but they have one thing in common : a growing following through social media			2
a new survey by the think tank @entity42 found that 14 prominent populist movements in @entity5 had 436,000 @entity45 followers between them -- with the far - right @entity47 and the @entity48 each having more than 80,000			1
of those followers , 32 % were younger than 21			0
demos asked supporters of these populist groups on @entity45 to respond to a survey -- and more than 12,000 did			1
the survey found the supporters were predominantly young men , more likely to take part in protests than other groups and highly disillusioned with mainstream politics			2
only 20 % of these online supporters trusted their national governments			1
and the vast majority listed immigration and @entity14 extremism as their greatest concerns			1
significantly , while a majority of those surveyed disavowed violence , 26 % regarded it as " acceptable to achieve the right outcome			0
" among followers of @entity36 in @entity37 and @entity73 in @entity74 , the proportion rose to well over 40 %			0
@entity73 is named after @entity76 poet @entity75 , who supported dictator @entity77 , and its leader told the @entity81 newspaper this week that the fascist leader was the group 's " point of reference			0
" several supporters of @entity36 last month staged a " white die - in " on the streets of @entity94 as a protest against perceived inaction by the authorities after the murder of a white teenager			2
this mind - set has already led to a violent response among a tiny minority , as the @entity99 massacre earlier this year -- and admitted to by suspect @entity100 -- showed			0
@entity100 purportedly authored a 1,500 - page manifesto critical of @entity103 immigration and @entity5 liberalism			1
the sort of grievances that motivated @entity100 are echoed throughout the @entity42 survey			0
one supporter of the @entity35 wrote : " no way can a @entity103 race bring their rules to our country			0
" another respondent identifying himself as a supporter of the @entity118 , which has 25 seats in the @entity121 parliament , reflected a view widely held among respondents : " the foreigners are slowly suffocating our lovely country			0
they have all these children and raise them so badly that in three or four generations there 'll be no ... well - behaved children at all			0
" a supporter of the @entity133 group @entity132 said his priorities were " human rights ... against @entity138 of @entity5 and intolerance by @entity141 and @entity142 immigrants towards gays and @entity144 , " an unusual twist on the traditional phobias of the far right			1
by country , supporters of the @entity146 and @entity36 were the most concerned about immigration , while followers of the @entity150 were the most likely to rate @entity14 extremism among their top concerns			1
the party , part of the current coalition government in the @entity156 , is led by @entity157 , who has described @entity14 as a ' fascist ' religion			1
while some respondents were openly racist , others were more concerned that @entity103 immigrants avoided assimilation			0
" prevent the oppression of @entity14 women , " wrote one @entity164 respondent , " by banning the burqa in public places			2
" many respondents share a loathing of what they see as a corrupt and complacent political class			0
a @entity45 follower of the @entity146 lamented " the desperate lies of the @entity175 , the comfortable way in which they live while the @entity37 face a multitude of problems such as insecurity , mass immigration ... " a supporter of the @entity183 in @entity74 , which has a significant presence in the national and regional assemblies , commented " i hate politicians ; they are all disgusting , especially when they get to the armchair of power			0
" this sentiment feeds into a gloomy assessment of @entity5 's future among followers of these populist movements			1
asked whether their country was on the right track , supporters of @entity37 , @entity195 , @entity133 and @entity196 groups were the most downbeat , with fewer than 10 % optimistic about the future			2
increasingly , the sentiment appears to be feeding growing hostility toward the @entity203			0
large majorities of supporters in all but one group ( the exception being the @entity183 in @entity74 ) regard the @entity203 as a waste of money , with inadequate control over its external borders , and hold it responsible for a loss of cultural identity			2
@entity42 says the survey shows how the convergence of virtual and real - world political activity " is the way millions of people -- especially young people -- relate to politics in the 21st century			0
" the challenge to @entity5 politicians , as they lurch from one crisis summit to the next , is to ensure this alienated generation does not desert civic society altogether .			2
