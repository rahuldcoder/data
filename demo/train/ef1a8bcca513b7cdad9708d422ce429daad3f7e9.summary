@entity0 , @entity1 -- the tiny faces pressed against the airport window stare in wonder at the aircraft waiting for them at the end of the sky bridge : this is the plane that will take them to a new life			1
@entity16 refugee @entity15 and his family - he has five sons and five daughters , aged from three to 22 -- fled their home in @entity21 as the country 's bloody civil war took hold			1
now , after almost three years of fear and uncertainty , they are on the move again , flying more than 12,000km from their temporary base in @entity30 to a more permanent home on the other side of the world			0
" returning to @entity16 is not an option , " @entity15 told @entity2 a day before he began the daunting 23 - hour journey to @entity1 , where he and his children are being resettled at the invitation of the country 's president @entity37			1
" i 'm excited to go to @entity1 but i 'm also nervous			1
i 'm going because i want my kids to continue their education , " he said			0
" traveling to the other side of the world to find a new chance to live , this is not easy , " said @entity1 's human rights secretary @entity42 , who accompanied the group , along with a @entity2 team			1
" they are very brave to choose a new destiny for their lives because they want to educate their kids with dignity			0
they deserve our help and they deserve the opportunity			1
" @entity1 has offered to take in up to 120 refugees to help with the humanitarian crisis sparked by the conflict in @entity16			1
@entity15 and his family are among the first 42 - five families -- to make the move			1
a second group is expected to follow by february 2015			0
together , they will live at @entity67 , a @entity68 home on the outskirts of the capital , @entity0 , for two months , learning @entity71 and adjusting to a new culture before moving on			0
first though , they have to get there			0
it 's a lengthy and life - changing journey - from @entity76 , via @entity77 and @entity78 - and one filled with mixed emotions			1
after one final briefing from @entity82 , operations manager at the @entity84 , which has organized the trip , and a last medical check - up , they are cleared to set off			0
for most of the refugees , it is their first time on a plane , so there is an air of excitement as well as of apprehension about what awaits them on arrival in @entity0			0
@entity15 's eldest sons , @entity99 and @entity100 are keen to learn all they can about their soon - to - be - adopted home , peppering me with questions when we first meet			1
" what is life like there ? " " what is the nature like ? " " how can we live there and adapt quickly ? how can we make friends ? " " what is the weather like there ? " " which places can we visit ? " they are all too aware that their first challenge will be the fact that they do n't speak @entity71 , but both young men are desperate to continue their education , having been forced to abandon their university studies when they left @entity21			2
inevitably , the conversation turns to football ; the brothers say they are looking forward to playing and watching it in @entity1			2
their favorite players ? @entity128 , @entity129 , and -- of course -- @entity131			0
as the plane makes its way across the vast @entity135 continent , @entity15 studies the flight 's interactive map on a screen			1
" hours have passed and we are still flying above @entity144 ! " he says in amazement at the size and scale of the countries passing below			0
after a brief stop in @entity78 - a chance for the refugees to stretch their legs after more than 19 hours flying - they are finally on the last leg of the journey , a short hop to @entity0			0
the children , by now familiar with the in - flight entertainment system , keep themselves occupied as they near their destination			2
two of their fellow passengers , @entity1 , greet the children with hugs and kisses after realizing who they are			1
" we are very happy to welcome them to our country , " they told @entity2			1
eventually , tired but with broad smiles on their faces , the enthusiastic group of refugees emerges from the @entity168 flight at @entity0 's @entity169			2
they are greeted by president @entity171 after their arrival			0
@entity171 later told reporters he hopes more countries will follow @entity1 's example and offer homes to @entity16 's refugees			1
" we must insist that the world moves in this direction ; we ca n't continue with statements on human rights and [ saying ] that we support human rights if later we do n't put our words into action , above all for the children			0
" according to the @entity189 , there are more than 1.1 million @entity16 refugees like @entity15 's family registered in @entity30 , while the country 's population is just over 4 million people			1
@entity30 's minister of social affairs , @entity196 , and @entity198 's representative in @entity30 , @entity199 , recently called for renewed investment in @entity30 infrastructure to help the country manage the influx of refugees from the @entity16 conflict			1
" @entity30 today faces an unprecedented challenge to manage both its own population and @entity16 refugees , " said @entity199			2
" the presence of over 1.5 million @entity16 across @entity30 has directly affected the public and service sectors at the national scale , " @entity196 explained			2
" from @entity215 all the way to the @entity135 , our towns and villages have been at the forefront of the humanitarian response to an incessantly escalating crisis			2
the inhabitants of these communities have opened their hearts and homes to the refugees			0
therefore , the projects undertaken since 2011 have brought much needed breathing space to our communities and improved our lives and the lives of our @entity16 kin			2
" walking from the plane towards his new home , one of the children proudly showed off his football shirt , bearing @entity131 's number 9			0
at last , he and his family have reached their final goal : a new country and a new life , leaving memories of war behind .			0

five @entity16 refugee families have been flown to @entity1 to begin a new life there
the group are the first of up to 120 @entity16 who will be resettled in the @entity135 country
father - of - ten @entity15 told @entity2 he was moving for the sake of his children 's education
" they deserve our help and they deserve the opportunity , " said @entity1 's @entity258
