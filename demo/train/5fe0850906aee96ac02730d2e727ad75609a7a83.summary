-- @entity1 was 33 years old when she received a painful reminder : she could n't outrun the past			1
@entity1 was trying to help a new assistant at her @entity6 rental property business , but it was n't going smoothly			1
part of it was @entity1 herself			1
" i had this startle reflex , " she explained			2
" the phone would ring , and i 'm literally three feet off the floor , screaming			2
" my new assistant said , ' you 're driving me crazy ! ' and i would say , ' i 'm really sorry , just please try to ignore it			2
it 's embarrassing , but let 's keep working			2
' " but the young man , a teacher on break , was n't pushed off easily			2
soon after , @entity1 said , " he walked over to my desk and dropped a stack of papers two inches thick			1
it was every single ptsd study that was online , and he just said , ' pick one			1
' " a few days later , @entity1 was dialing the number of @entity28 psychiatrist dr. @entity27			1
her plan : to see whether she could free herself of a lifetime of torment by taking a drug he was testing -- a drug most people know as @entity35			2
a teetotaler , @entity1 was n't looking for a thrill			1
she 'd been born to a young hippie mother who could n't stand the thought of parking their @entity41 bus in one spot			2
after seeing psychedelic casualties all along the road , to @entity46 , drugs signified a lack of control			2
that was the last thing she needed			2
it was hard enough to hold things together stone sober			2
truth be told , @entity1 did n't need her new assistant to tell her what the problem was			1
she just did n't know how to fix it			2
she 'd been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder , traced to a period of sexual abuse as a child and a life - threatening car accident			1
she 'd been hospitalized four times for the debilitating symptoms , and stress had caused bleeding ulcers bad enough to send her to the emergency room twice more			1
along the way , she tried cognitive behavioral therapy , hypnosis and acupuncture			2
she tried an established therapy called eye movement desensitization and reprocessing , where a therapist used physical stimuli -- light tapping and guided eye movements -- to try to retrain her brain			1
it made her eyeballs feel like they would burst out of her head			0
she tried gestalt therapy , screaming out her rage			0
" nothing worked , " she says			0
" i got to the point where i just said , ' i 'm handicapped			0
i 'm just going to have to live my life like this			0
' it was pretty horrible			0
" a formal plan more than 7 million @entity91 suffer from @entity92 , and by most estimates , only half of them -- at best -- are ever cured			1
a decade ago , the widely acknowledged need for better treatments opened the door to @entity27 and his unconventional approach			1
by the time he took @entity1 's call in february 2005 , the soft - spoken , ponytailed @entity27 had managed to convince the @entity100 to green - light a study of @entity35 as an adjunct to psychotherapy			1
of course , he was n't calling it @entity35			0
neither were the scientists from the @entity107 and certainly not the @entity100 agents who had picked over @entity27 's bungalow in @entity110 , @entity28 , making sure it was " secure " in case drug - hunting criminals tried to break in and grab the stash			1
he 'd gotten the 3,4 - methylenedioxy - methylamphetamine ( @entity35 ) -- the chemical name for pure @entity35 -- from @entity117 , the founder of a maps , the @entity119			1
the group 's stated purpose is to develop " medical , legal and cultural contexts for people to benefit from the careful uses of psychedelics and marijuana			0
" it wants to turn mind - altering drugs like @entity35 into prescription medicine			1
the advocacy unsettles some people , but this was no @entity134 operation			0
@entity117 says he was determined to do things the right way			0
" doing science that gets reported , that 's an idea we can sort of leverage , " @entity117 said			0
to win broader acceptance for @entity35 -- and for cousins like lsd and psilocybin , the mind - altering compound in so - called magic mushrooms -- " the medical route was the only route			1
" that meant a formal plan for drug development : study protocols , institutional review boards and the rest			1
@entity27 , a @entity157 - trained clinician who specializes in trauma and had a long - running interest in @entity35 , was the perfect partner			1
when @entity27 enrolled the first patient in the new study in 2004 , @entity91 troops were in @entity163 fighting the longest - running war in @entity91 history			1
they just did n't know it yet			0
even then , there were men and women jumping out of their shoes at the sound of a car horn and waking up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat from another nightmare			0
but most troops had n't come home yet			0
a sense of crisis was years away , but @entity27 -- and other specialists in psychological trauma -- were bracing for a wave of tortured souls			1
before taking @entity1 's call , the doctor had spent nearly three years navigating the federal bureaucracy to win approval for his small experiment , designed to test a simple question : is @entity35 , used in a clinical setting , safe ? the point is sometimes lost , but even today , civilians make up the vast majority of people struggling with @entity92			1
as @entity27 launched his research , he would n't be working with veterans			1
he 'd be working with civilians , mostly female survivors of sexual assault			0
all had tried conventional treatments -- either therapy or medication -- without success			0
on average , they had suffered their debilitating symptoms for 19 years			1
@entity1 was patient no. 7			1
' it just would n't stop ' @entity46 was used to putting on a front			0
to a casual visitor , she seemed fine			0
her rental property business in @entity213 earned a steady living , and she and a close friend were happily raising a 13 - year - old son through an unconventional co-parenting arrangement			2
she was restless on @entity6 , but after a bumpy childhood , it seemed she 'd found a kind of peace			0
but you did n't have to look hard to see a dark side			0
" i was argumentative and defensive , and i was very angry , " she recalled			0
" i was having panic attacks and anxiety attacks and all the physical problems that come with it			0
i had irritable bowel syndrome , and i could n't sleep			0
" to survive , she pushed people away			0
" it makes intimate relationships very difficult , " she said			0
" some part of me was on guard , and it just would n't stop			0
" to be continued in sunday 's story			0
