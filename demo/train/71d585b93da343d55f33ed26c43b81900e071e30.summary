editor 's note : @entity2 , who served as political director for president @entity4 , is a @entity5 strategist who was national chairman of former @entity8 gov. @entity7 's 2008 presidential campaign			1
@entity2 says failing to find the wmds in @entity10 was far more than a disappointment			1
@entity12 ( @entity13 ) -- one week from today , a historic presidency begins and a tarnished presidency ends			1
the inauguration of @entity17 , the first @entity19 - @entity18 president , can not come quickly enough for the vast majority of @entity18			1
this young man with the keen disciplined mind and the buffed body begins a presidency with high hopes , goodwill and a never - ending list of problems left on the @entity30 desk by @entity31 , the ever - confident occupant of that high office who seems like the dinner guest who will not leave			1
in all my years around @entity36 as an observer and as a member of several administrations , i have rarely witnessed an event as bizarre as president @entity31 's farewell press conference yesterday			1
it reminded me of @entity50 's november 17 , 1973 , question and answer session before 400 @entity47 managing editors at the height of the @entity46 , in which he declared : " people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook			0
well , i 'm not a crook			0
" well , to the best of my knowledge , @entity50 was n't a crook ( in the technical sense )			2
he was dishonest , he abused the office of the presidency , and telling the truth was n't his strong suit			1
and he resigned in disgrace and would have been impeached if he had n't			2
but there were also periods in his presidency that were very good for this country and the world			2
president @entity31 is not a crook either			1
and even more importantly , i do n't believe he is dishonest or an incompetent			1
the mistakes of his presidency were caused by overconfidence , bad information or a certain arrogance that was still fully on display yesterday			1
how can you reflect on going to war , a war of choice , and argue that " not finding weapons of mass destruction was a significant disappointment , " as president @entity31 did yesterday ? and putting the " not finding the weapons " in the same breath as " we should n't have hung the sign , ' @entity81 ' " ! a disappointment is when you 're a football fan and your team lost in the playoffs or in the national championship game			1
eliminating weapons of mass destruction was the rationale for sending hundreds of thousands of men and women to @entity10 to risk their lives and spending billions of dollars of @entity18 taxpayers ' money			0
find out how some readers are angry over @entity31 's legacy the rationale for the war was n't that @entity105 was a bad guy -- which he was -- and that he violated every sanction and agreement that the @entity110 put on him			1
president @entity31 went on to say : " one thing about the presidency is that you can only make decisions based on the information at hand			1
you do n't get to have information after you make the decision -- that 's not the way it works			0
" that is correct and that may be the most important lesson our new president can learn from the failures of the last			1
make sure you get the information to make the right decisions			0
president @entity31 , referring to the @entity131 scandal and the missing weapons of mass destruction , said , " i do n't know if you want to call those mistakes or not , but things did n't go as planned , let 's put it that way			1
" the lesson for president - elect @entity17 is often things do n't go as planned			1
last week four men who have been president had lunch in the @entity144 with the newly elected president			0
as i looked at the picture of the five members of the most exclusive club in the world standing in the @entity30 , i felt sad			0
two of the men , @entity152 and @entity153 , now in their 80s , had been overwhelmingly defeated in their bids for re-election			0
president @entity157 and president @entity31 , both in their 60s , had periods of great failure			1
the present president leaves office with the lowest approval ratings in modern history			0
none of these were bad men -- just the opposite			0
why did their presidencies not live up to those high expectations that we all have for our new leaders on @entity174 ? in some cases , they fought their natural allies			0
president @entity152 was particularly inept at dealing with @entity178 ; so was the current president @entity31			2
@entity152 and the two @entity180 failed at communicating with the public and were unable to articulate what their programs were and build support for them in @entity178			0
@entity157 , a good communicator , was terribly undisciplined			0
president @entity17 will need to set his priorities early			2
he ca n't do all he 's promised in the first term			2
he needs to build strong relationships with the @entity178 and let them play a big role in setting his agenda			0
he needs to use his tremendous communication skills and continually explain to the country what he wants to do and why			0
then he needs to take his campaign machine and motivate the grassroots organization he built to get @entity178 to support his programs			0
he must be patient but persistent in making his case			0
as we hope for the change which is coming next week , i just want to pause and reflect and say to president @entity31 , " thank you , for serving your country			2
" to our new president : best of luck and you have our prayers			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity31 ends his second term with a tarnished presidency
he says @entity31 was n't incompetent or dishonest but he showed arrogance
@entity2 says the four former presidents who met with @entity17 all had great failures
he says lesson for @entity17 is that things often do n't go as planned
