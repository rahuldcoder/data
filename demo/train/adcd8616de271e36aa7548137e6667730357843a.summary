@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3			1
the dining scene in @entity0 is pretty hot these days			2
so why did nearly a thousand @entity7 pay $ 100 - a - pop last saturday night to chew wilted salads and poke at dried - out chicken breast with a bunch of strangers inside a drafty conventional hall ? politics , of course			2
it was the @entity18 's @entity17 , the party 's big annual fundraiser and final cheerleading session before next tuesday 's midterm elections			1
we were there for this week 's edition of " @entity26			2
" even as modern developments like @entity30 , super pacs and micro-targeting erode the the quaint traditions of politics , the " rubber chicken circuit " endures			2
it 's a durable fixture of campaign life , as time - honored as the gaffe and gotcha question			0
@entity38 have their @entity39 , and @entity40 convene at @entity41 or @entity42			1
there are variations of the form depending on local traditions : my favorite political banquet name is the @entity49 , held yearly by the @entity50 in @entity51 and named in honor of the state 's 43rd governor			1
but the pageantry is the same wherever you travel : candidates and elected officials speak , rally faithful partisans and raise cash for the party organization			1
in places like @entity1 and @entity65 , the dinners take on an added importance : ambitious pols with their eyes on the @entity69 come here to test drive their national appeal and forge relationships in crucial early nominating states			1
on saturday , we heard @entity74 , the @entity76 senator and possible presidential candidate in 2016 or 2020 , speak at the @entity78 in @entity0			0
she was hardly the first @entity69 aspirant to do so			0
" he had n't said he would run in 1972 , but there he was on the rubber chicken circuit , glad - handing county chairmen and looking for early commitments , " the legendary @entity80 scribe @entity79 wrote four decades ago in a profile of @entity82 , the @entity83 senator who never made it to the @entity85			0
the rubber chicken phrase surfaces across the decades in political journalism , and with good reason — the chow ai n't grand			2
on saturday , the menu was roughly the same as any @entity96 — or @entity97 or @entity98 on the @entity40 side — you 'd find in counties and states from @entity83 to @entity103			0
there was some kind of mass - produced chicken breast , slathered with some indistinguishable sauce , accompanied by a passel of steamed vegetables			0
there was the all - important " vegan option , " for those rare @entity1 herbivores in the audience			1
and attendees could choose from an assortment of cake slices that had been sitting out on their banquet tables for several hours before the first speaker even took the stage			0
but the food is n't why people come			0
" if we lose this concept of having political parties , where people can gather and have a platform and join together , we really lose what 's been at the core of democracy , " @entity74 said when we asked her about the importance of these dinners			1
" what 's missing of course if when people get there and get elected is their ability to put that aside some and work together			0
