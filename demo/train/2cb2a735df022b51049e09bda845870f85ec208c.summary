-- this week marks one of the most - exciting non-major events of the golf season -- the @entity4 at the famed @entity5			1
with a deep field and a great course , you wo n't want to miss any of the action			2
before the tournament tees off , we had a chance to catch up with @entity5 pga head professional @entity13 , who provided some inside insight on the home of the @entity16			1
@entity17 : thanks for joining us			2
this week presents one of the most exciting on the schedule with the @entity4			1
what is it that makes the @entity23 such a special event ? @entity13 : it 's the @entity4 ... @entity4 is crown jewel of the @entity16			1
the world 's best golfers are on a course that demands the highest level of shot - making and offers an unbelievable fan experience			2
it 's also the highest purse in golf with the champion taking home $ 1.71 million at the end of the week			0
the @entity36 was specifically built to host the @entity4 and offer our fans the best possible viewing			1
everyone wants to see the action on the final three holes , especially the 17th			2
it 's the lure of the hole and watching the best players in the world challenge the island green			1
@entity17 : we ca n't talk about the @entity23 without mentioning the world - famous , par - 3 17th island green , which you just touched on			1
i recently heard a promo with a player saying , " 51 weeks a year , no. 17 at @entity5 is the easiest hole in the world for @entity16 players			1
" i do n't know if i would agree with that , but of course , that 52nd week is the @entity23			0
we know why it 's daunting , but it 's less than 150 yards			0
is there any truth to what that @entity16 player said ? @entity13 : a few stats on the 17thhole -- it plays 121 yards from the middle of the championship tee to the front of the green			1
to the back of the green it 's 146 yards			2
the 17th green is 3,912 square feet compared to the average of 4,500 square feet			1
the challenge of the 17th hole is its ability to taunt the mental toughness of a player			1
it 's a very calculating shot because you have to factor the wind , firmness of the green and avoid looking at the body of water surrounding the island green			1
during the @entity23 , you add in the thousands of fans ! we give tours every day to visitors and the no. 1 comment of amazement is , " the green looks so small compared to television			2
" making a par 3 on the 17th hole at @entity5 will bring a smile to all players , whether they are a novice or the best players in the world			1
@entity17 : @entity103 of @entity104 is your defending champion			0
through the years with the likes of @entity103 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 -- the list goes on -- the @entity23 has had quite a list of international champions			1
what is it about the course that yields such diverse champions ? @entity13 : in the 36 - year history of the @entity23 , 10 of the victories have been by international players			0
the @entity36 does not favor any style of player			0
the goal of former commissioner @entity125 was to create a golf course that had balance in regards to distance , wind direction and shot - making			0
he wanted to create a goal course that was fair and would challenge every skill of the game			0
the goal at the end of week is to crown the greatest player in world			2
the diversity of the field allows the @entity23 and @entity16 to expand the scope of the tournament to a world - wide audience			1
@entity17 : in 1994 , @entity110 won the players with a remarkable 24 - under 264			1
that 's by far the best winning score in tournament history			2
is there any chance someone could come within a sniff of that this year ? @entity13 : in 1994 , when @entity110 set the overall tournament record , the conditions started off perfect the first round with 76 players shooting under par. @entity110 started off on thursday with a course - record round of 63 , followed by three rounds of 67 's to beat @entity159 by four shots			1
in 1994 , the @entity23 was played in march			2
with the tournament now being played in may the course is much firmer and faster conditions			2
in march , we had a lot of inconsistency in weather			0
it could be in the high 70s and beautiful or in the 50s with rain			0
the temperatures have become much more consistent , but the golf course plays much differently			0
when played in march , the golf course was overseeded			0
it 's now @entity177 grass all year			0
the golf ball has more opportunity to run through the fairways and the greens			0
the forecast is shaping up to be a beautiful week			0
what 's the best part about working at @entity5 ? @entity13 : excellent question ... @entity5 is a very special place being that it 's the home of the @entity23 and @entity16			1
it is a privilege to work around such a passionate and dedicated group of people			0
everyone on our team is focused on creating a magical experience for the @entity16 players , members and guests			1
every team member comes to the club with a positive " can do " attitude			0
we have a team that is extremely dedicated and passionate about their role at the club			0
one of the most special things about @entity5 is the interaction with all the people that travel from all over the world to visit			1
many of them have personal stories and connections why @entity5 is their favorite course			1
there are definitely days that you have to pinch yourself			0
we are very fortunate to have the opportunity to work at such a beautiful place that is showcased to the world every year			0
as a club and being apart of the @entity16 , we have a lot of involvement with local charitable organizations			2
almost every month we have a charitable initiative that we are giving back to you			0
