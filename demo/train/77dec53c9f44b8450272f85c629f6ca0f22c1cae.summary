-- @entity2 's most critical and complex election in its 50th year since independence kicks off on march 4 , next monday			1
critical because it 'll be the first real road test of the new @entity6 - style liberal constitution promulgated in august 2010 in the aftermath of @entity2 's near - death experience after the controversial 2007 elections that resulted in a convulsion of violence that saw over 1,000 killed and at one point over 600,000 displaced			1
critical as well because , crucially , two of the leading contenders , @entity13 and @entity15 of the @entity16 are defendants before the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) accused of crimes against humanity			1
they deny the charges , and will both run in the election			0
rather unfortunately , an election many had hoped would be about the new constitution and resolving the underlying issues that made the last election so toxic , has ended up , thus far , defined by the @entity18 and the tribal mobilization this has enabled			1
read this : can mobiles help stop @entity2 election violence ? it is a complex election as well because @entity2 is implementing a devolved 47 - county system of government via these polls -- electing governors , senators , county representatives and other officials to a brand new federated structure of government -- an election that will be , per capita , the most expensive in the world			1
still , @entity2 -- especially the rural poor -- are enthusiastic about devolution as it promises greater accountability on the part of one of the continent 's most durable , sophisticated , well resourced , corrupt and ruthless elites			1
while much attention has focused on the close and potentially troublesome presidential election the real action may actually turn out to be at the county level that is totally new			0
@entity2 are coming to terms with the fact that what " normal " means is about to change forever			1
all these factors , combined with reports of continuing ethnic balkanization in informal settlements , threats and arming for both defensive and offensive violence , have served to create an atmosphere of high anxiety preceding the polls			0
the anxiety is in part because the country is trying to move so many big governance boulders at the same time informed by the violence that took place last time			0
peace - building activities ( prayers , concerts , roadshows , talk shows , plays , films etc. ) have been legion , competing for overloaded national political bandwidth during this hectic electioneering period			0
it all reveals a country that terrified itself out of its own wits as a result of the sheer barbarity and speed of the meltdown in 2008			0
read this : @entity2 djs go without food for peaceful elections that said , barring some catastrophic blunder by the nascent @entity100 ( @entity100 ) that shall be conducting the election , which pollsters predict will be so close between the two leading candidates , @entity13 and @entity104 that a run - off is likely , @entity2 elections are usually smooth affairs			1
a second round is an innovation to @entity2 and much will transpire between the first and second rounds if there is n't a clear winner on march 4			1
the @entity18 has destabilized @entity2 's politics but introduced a new measure of elite accountability , raising the cost of elite - driven violence to a level that has meant the tribal vitriol of previous electioneering has n't been in such evidence this time around			1
going by remarks of the @entity18 's president , the @entity2 case has clearly challenged the @entity18 too			1
indeed , the future of the institution as a credible agent of change on the continent is dependent on how the @entity2 process plays out			1
however , regardless of the outcome , it is likely that a sizeable chunk of the @entity2 population will vote for @entity18 indictees with all the implications that has for the rule of law , @entity2 's posture with regard to international standards of human rights and good governance , and for the country 's standing within the @entity147 continent and global community			1
it will also hopefully lead to a good dose of national introspection			0
indeed , it seemed to dawn on the business community and middle class ( roughly 10 % of the 14.3 million registered voters ) only in the past month the terrible implications of " getting this one wrong			0
" at a time when there has been considerable excitement about @entity147 's economic prospects , underpinned by deepening democratic culture in places like @entity164 and @entity2 , if @entity2 falters in this transition it is not unlikely that the implications will be a review of the @entity147 renaissance that has at times caused excessive hyperventilating by hedge fund managers in the @entity172 as the world 's latest " emerging market " emerges			2
what 's clear , however , is that for @entity2 the emergence will be bumpy and even bloody at times			2
according to the @entity181 , between january last year and the start of this year , for example , almost 500 @entity2 ( including dozens of police ) have been killed in a worrying trend of the normalization of violence , and 112,000 citizens have been displaced			2
read this : can tech revolutionize @entity147 elections ? lots of unfinished business lingers from the last convulsion of violence and underlies it			0
tribalism , historical grievances with regard to land , corruption , drug trafficking , money laundering and impunity among the elite in general have served to hold back the most globalized , diverse , industrious , economically innovative and dynamic country on the eastern side of the @entity147 continent			0
but most @entity2 , if not all their leaders , have a great will to make a success out of a transition that will lay the foundation for a stable , peaceful and prosperous future for the next generations			2
the need for a peaceful transition is particularly powerful in the collective imagination			0
there is an understanding that change wo n't come overnight , however , for while the new constitution has changed the forest , as a local saying goes , the monkeys have remained the same			0
all the leading presidential contenders are part of the old elite			2
that said , the constitution includes a raft of institutions and checks and balances that are also unprecedented			0
secondly , @entity2 has never had a younger , healthier , better educated , more globally connected and tech - savvy population in its entire history -- 75 % of @entity2 are below 30 years of age			2
indeed , there are five million first - time voters between the ages of 18 and 25			0
@entity2 are acutely aware that the conduct of the upcoming polls and the implementation of the new constitution , our handling of the @entity18 cases , will impact not only our future but the way @entity147 , and the world , views @entity147			1
honor means we have to get it right , despite the apparent odds			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			2

two candidates are accused of crimes against humanity by @entity18
it will implement system that promises greater accountability on the part of the elite
