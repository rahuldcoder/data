-- the @entity2 will review the case of a cancer patient fighting to keep her electricity on to power her oxygen machine , the commission told @entity0 on wednesday			1
@entity8 , who has stage 4 cancer , was denied help paying for electricity , which she needs to power her oxygen tank			1
@entity0 affiliate @entity13 of @entity14 , @entity15 , said calls poured in from as far away as @entity17 after the station aired its story on @entity8 , a stage 4 cancer patient who received a cutoff notice after she fell behind on her bills			1
" i 'm on a set income , " she told @entity13			2
" my husband lost his job			0
he finds a little work every now and then , but it 's hard			0
" she applied to @entity31 's @entity30 which helps maintain service for people who depend on electric - powered life support systems , but she was rejected			2
" i 'm fighting for my life , and i thought people at the power company would help me , " said @entity35 , who uses a wheelchair			1
" i just thought they 'd make some kind of exception for me			0
" @entity35 's power will stay on until the commission examines the facts in the case , said @entity47 , spokesman for the commission			1
@entity31 told @entity35 she failed to meet the criteria			2
spokeswoman @entity50 told @entity13 that @entity35 could have bought a battery - powered oxygen machine			1

" this program is a communication program , not a guarantee of uninterrupted power , even to customers who are on the list , " she said			0
