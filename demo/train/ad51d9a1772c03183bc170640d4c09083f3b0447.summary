-- much of the war crimes trial of former @entity3 president @entity2 focused on the role played by so - called " conflict diamonds " in funding rebels in conflict areas			1
what are " conflict diamonds ? " conflict or " blood " diamonds are illegally traded to fund conflict in war - torn areas , particularly in central and western @entity14 , according to the @entity15 , which represents the commercial diamond trade			1
the @entity17 defines conflict diamonds as " ... diamonds that originate from areas controlled by forces or factions opposed to legitimate and internationally recognized governments , and are used to fund military action in opposition to those governments , or in contravention of the decisions of the @entity28			1
" they are generally in " rough " form , meaning they have recently been extracted and not yet cut			0
at the height of the civil war in @entity35 , it is estimated that conflict diamonds represented approximately four percent of the world 's diamond production			1
what role did they play in the war ? @entity2 was accused of arming rebel groups and terrorizing civilians during the decade - long civil war in exchange for uncut diamonds smuggled out to him in empty mayonnaise jars			1
he was found guilty of aiding the rebels , but a judge ruled that prosecutors failed to prove he was in command of them			0
during the trial @entity54 supermodel @entity53 was summoned as a witness for the prosecution			2
she told the court she received a gift of " dirty - looking stones " from two men following a dinner hosted by then - @entity14 president @entity63 in 1997			2
the prosecution argued the stones were " blood diamonds " -- a personal gift from @entity2			1
that claim contradicted @entity2 's testimony that he never handled the precious stones that fueled the conflict			1
who suffers from conflict diamonds ? apart from the innocent people caught up in the conflicts that the trade fuels , thousands of men , women and children in countries such as @entity35 are used as slaves to extract diamonds			1
they are often forced to use primitive , back - breaking methods such as digging into mud or gravel along river banks with their bare hands			2
the collected material is then separated using hand - held sieves			2
what is being done to stop the trade ? late last year a major international environmental group pulled out of the so - called @entity95 designed to guarantee that diamonds do not come from conflict zones			1
@entity98 said it had refused " to evolve and address the clear links between diamonds , violence and tyranny			2
" the @entity95 started when @entity104 diamond - producing states met in @entity105 , @entity14 , in may 2000 , to discuss ways to stop the trade in conflict diamonds and ensure that diamond purchases were not funding violence			1
the result was an agreement by the @entity17 , @entity112 , the governments of 74 countries , the @entity15 -- representing the industry -- and a number of interest groups such as @entity98			0
they established the @entity95 ( @entity95 ) , whereby members are required to certify that all rough diamond exports are produced through legitimate mining and sales activities and are " conflict - free			1
" each shipment carries a certificate that details where the diamonds came from , how they were mined , where they were cut and polished , the parties involved , and their ultimate destination			0
the idea is that members of the @entity95 can not trade with non-members			0
is it working ? according to @entity134 of @entity98 , the @entity95 has yet to demonstrate itself capable of stopping the trade because of a lack of political will among member states			0
" @entity146 , for example , is a test case for the @entity95 , " she told @entity0 in 2010 , alleging that @entity141 's regime has benefited from the sale of blood diamonds despite it being a member of the @entity95			1
she said the huge @entity149 diamond fields of eastern @entity146 are operated by military - run syndicates who beat or kill miners who do n't mine for them or pay bribes			0
the extreme violence perpetrated by the military even included the mass murder of hundreds of miners by helicopter gunships , she added			0
@entity0 gets exclusive access to @entity149 mines but with just one or two member states able to veto any punitive action against abuses or infringements of the @entity95 scheme , no decisive action has been taken against @entity146			0
" this consensus decision - making means tough decisions do n't get made , " said @entity169			0
" certain countries are putting economic and political interests in front of defending the fundamental principles of the scheme			0
" is the " conflict trade " limited to diamonds ? no. according to @entity98 , rebel fighters and army units have hijacked the trade in mineral ores , used in the production of mobile phones and computers , from eastern @entity185 ( @entity185 ) , while subjecting the local population to massacres , rape , extortion , and forced labor			2
the " conflict minerals " are then laundered into the global supply chain by export houses , before being transformed into refined metals by large international smelting firms			0
@entity98 says the operations of some of the world 's leading consumer brands are now being scrutinized for evidence of links to this rogue trade .			0
