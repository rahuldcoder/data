unmanned aerial vehicles are n't generally thought of as technology that improves lives ; they 're more readily associated with spying or attacking things			1
however a competition in the @entity6 is trying to change all that			2
last month , the government launched the @entity9 , a two - part competition inviting local and international engineers alike to submit proposals for @entity13 aimed at improving government services locally and bettering humanity worldwide			1
while the @entity6 has thrown itself into the manufacturing of military drones ( at last year 's @entity18 , @entity20 - based @entity19 had the largest selection of @entity13 ) , the government is also hoping to lead the way in the implementation of machines meant for civilian use			1
" drones get a lot of bad publicity related to surveillance and military operations , " admits @entity26 , the project manager			2
" but at the end of the day , they 're only a tool of technology			2
our message is that we can use it for the good of people all over the world			0
we 've already seen a lot of potential for humanitarian uses			0
" the first phase of the competition , which comes with a $ 270,000 cash award , invites @entity6 residents to submit ideas that can be employed by the country 's various government services ( @entity52 envisions drones monitoring traffic and being the first responder at emergency scenes within the next five years )			1
the competition is an extension of the @entity6 's ambition of becoming the first government to use @entity13 to deliver government services			1
in february , @entity62 announced it started testing drones to make lightweight deliveries -- namely official documents , like ids and driver 's licenses , and medication -- and would employ fingerprint technology to confirm the identities of recipients			1
the government also envisions drones acting as the first responder at accident scenes			2
the announcement was accompanied by the unveiling of a battery - operated drone model developed by @entity6 engineers			2
" i think it is a new stage of development , not only for the @entity6 , but for the world , " the @entity6 's minister of cabinet affairs , @entity79 , told @entity80 earlier this year			1
" either you embrace this technology , or you resist it			0
if you resist it , then the gap between you and your competitor would n't be a year or two , it 's going to be 500 years , " he continued			0
the competition also has an international component , with higher stakes , and a heftier award of $ 1m			0
international submissions are n't limited to government services			1
they just need to make the world a better place			0
" innovation does n't have an address			0
it comes from different geographical areas , from r&d centers and from the poor guy in @entity106 trying to provide a service or feed a certain need with technology			0
we want to give a chance to everyone in this world to be part of this innovation exercise , " says @entity26 .			0

the @entity6 launched the @entity9 for @entity117 last month
they 're seeking ideas on how unmanned aerial vehicles can better the world
@entity62 is hoping to use drones for government services
