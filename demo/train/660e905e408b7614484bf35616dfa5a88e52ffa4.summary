-- @entity2 ceo @entity1 and coo @entity3 have resigned in the wake of the interest rate - fixing scandal that has rocked the bank			1
the resignations come less than a week after @entity2 , one of the world 's largest banks , was fined $ 450 million by @entity13 and @entity14 regulators after admitting it purposely under - reported its interest rates as part of @entity17 ( @entity19 interbank offered rate ) -- an interest rate floor between big banks that is set in @entity19 each trading morning			1
@entity0 interviewed analyst @entity22 , a former investment banker with more than 20 years experience in the financial services sector , about @entity1 's resignation and what it means for the future of banking culture			1
what does @entity1 's resignation mean ? @entity1 's resignation sets a precedent -- we have to realize that @entity2 was the first of 15 banks that are under investigation for @entity17 manipulation			1
let 's say that even half of those banks come to the same conclusion and are fined by the regulators			2
does this mean we 're going to lose seven or eight of the most powerful bank ceos in the world ? if that 's the case then this signals a complete and radical cultural change within the financial services industry , and the whole industry will change because of this			2
and that 's why @entity2 were so important to get this right			1
this was an unforgivable situation for one simple reason : this affects the public			1
when banks beat up on each other , who cares ? when banks beat up on professional investors -- high net worth individuals , people who should know better -- who cares ? but when you start messing with grandmothers ' pensions , everyone cares , and that 's why this is a game - changer			1
explain how this scandal has affected the public ? the libor rates for different currencies are directly connected to 99 % of all ( commercial ) banking products -- mortgages , credit cards , and payouts for things like pensions are all based on @entity17 rates			1
so if banks are manipulating @entity17 rates , what they 're basically doing is taking money out of the public 's pocket , because their mortgage rates change , because their interest rates change , their loans / credit cards change -- or their pension income changes			1
various @entity17 rates are determined each day for different currencies ( dollar , yen , euro ) around the world , and these rates are the benchmark by which commercial banking operations around the world are conducted each day in those respective currencies			1
what side of the bank was most interested in @entity17 ? this would be the investment bank , because they make money on libor day in and day out			1
as head of the @entity2 investment wing when @entity17 was being manipulated , is n't it hard to believe @entity1 did n't know it was going on ? actually it is believable , because it 's about 15 people globally who handle @entity17 -- 15 people who pick up the phone and talk to their colleagues and say : " let 's make @entity17 this today , " so he would n't know about these conversations , so we do n't blame him or think what he did was criminal -- what we think was that he should 've had more oversight at the bank			1
how will this actually be a culture change ? wo n't it be a slap on the wrist ? the new management coming in is going to have to say " we have to look at every part of the bank that affects the public , and we have to have so many checks and balances that absolutely nothing can happen			1
" up to this point , if you 're a banker and you screw the public , whatever -- the assumption was that the net benefit to the economy of your bank was greater than one or two individuals ( in the public )			1
what we 're saying now is " no , if you screw one person , you 're out of here -- you screw another bank , a professional investor , go ahead -- but if you screw a grandmother ( out of money ) , you 're out			2
" the next @entity2 boss will be from the same banking culture as @entity1			1
what will be different ? the change is very simple -- now they know they can get fired for those things			0
before they thought they were untouchable			0
the problem with culture is the degrees of separation -- these guys know the price of a bottle of @entity172 , but you ask them the price of a pint of milk and they have absolutely no clue			0
the new management will come on and say , " i have to know the price of a pint of milk , i have to know what people pay on a mortgage , and i have to make sure that whatever i do at this bank is n't going to affect that			2
" and that 's a great change			0
it 's something we need			0
what qualities will a bank boss in this " new culture " need ? the next boss needs to be a general			2
before a boss would only worry about money -- as long as at the end of the year the bottom line says you were profitable -- that 's not enough anymore			0
you have to profitable , but you have to be moral as well			0
more morality in banking is exactly what we 're talking about -- the culture has to be moral , what happened here is n't about money , it 's a morality issue			0
where has this push for " moral " banking come from ? banks are no longer on a pedestal			0
all of a sudden banks and grocery stores are at the same level -- we would n't accept a supermarket selling us spoiled bananas			0
historically , whatever the banks said we would do , but now we wo n't accept that anymore			0
people are saying , ' hold on , you 're a business like any other business , you make money off our backs , so do what i tell you to do			0
' i remember the days when banks opened at 10:00 a.m. and closed at 3:00 p.m. with an hour for lunch			0
so you had to change your entire life to deal with the banks			0
the change is that the public understands what banks are doing and all of a sudden we say there are alternatives -- i can put my money into @entity240 , @entity240 has a bank			1
i can get a credit card at @entity246			0
so all of a sudden the banks are realizing they need to start doing the right thing			0
how big is the libor scandal going to get ? this is a potential scandal for the 15 biggest banks in the world , because they 're the only ones who play with @entity17 rates -- these are huge organizations , which also poses some risk			1
these are enormous organizations employing millions of people			0
the biggest problem with the @entity1 thing is people may believe that all bankers are evil			1
fifteen guys cause @entity17 rates , and if the police have their say they 're going to be in prison			1
but a million other people working for a bank get up and do an honest day 's work for an honest living , they send their kids to school , they 're honest people			2
we should n't paint everyone with the same brush			0
how many people determine @entity17 ? is the system going to change because of this scandal ? it usually ends up being one person at each bank who determines @entity17 for the day			1
a bank determines what they want @entity17 to be for the day , and the @entity17 person calls up his equivalent and the other banks and they negotiate what the rate will be for that day			1
that number then pops up on every computer around that bank , and that 's the rate			2
the system absolutely has to change -- we 've been talking about changing the system for some time , but we just believe that in a period of such change because of the economic crisis , we should wait until everything settles down and then change it			0
if the @entity304 - style bankruptcies that wrecked the global economy did n't bring real change , why will this scandal ? the difference is that all of @entity304 ' customers were all filthy rich			1
their customers were governments , municipalities , professionals in the financial services industries -- they knew what they were doing , there were risks that they all understood			0
but ( @entity2 ) is retail banking : this is human - being - to - human - being , people who are n't expected to know anything about financial services , they 're expected to be able to trust the banks			1
that 's what makes this different			0
in fact , we give these banks a license on the agreement that they never put ordinary customers at risk , and that 's what they did here			0
so @entity1 resigning is the start of a new era of commercial banking ? it is , and the banks do n't like to move fast , but the governments are going to insist on a culture change			2
let 's see how things go with the other banks ( that may be implicated in libor rate - manipulation ) -- if i were any of the other banks , i 'd want to stay real quiet now			1
i 'd want to keep this thing in the courts for 10 years until everybody forgets about it			0
any early favorites for the next @entity2 ceo ? would you want that job ? that 's the problem -- i think anyone who probably should fit into that job is smart enough not to want it			1
why would you do that ? if you want to be in a bank right now , you want to be number two			2
you get just as much money as the top guy , but you 're not in the press all the time -- so the next time a head has to roll , it 's someone else 's head			2
but this culture change wo n't transform the investment bank - related issues that brought down the global financial system in 2008 , will it ? that 's fair , but we 've been working on a solution to that problem for a few years now			2
so we 're well under way to fixing that problem			2
if you look at the difference ( since 2008 ) , the banks are far better capitalized now , and they have all been moving in the right -- or " protect the banks " -- direction			0
what banks have not been doing is moving in the " protect the customer " direction , and this is going to be make them move that way now			0
