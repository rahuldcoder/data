@entity0 first told us that truth can be stranger than fiction , which is of course true			2
but in this instance , it 's funnier , too			1
that 's the premise behind the off - @entity9 comedy " @entity10 ! spin ! , " the story of some of the most memorable political sex scandals of recent times			1
remember these classics ? @entity16 , former @entity17 governor : " as much as i did talk about going to the @entity19 , that is n't where i ended up			2
" @entity26 , former @entity27 congressman : " i have engaged in several inappropriate conversations , conducted over @entity20 , @entity21 , email and occasionally on the phone with women i had met online			2
" @entity29 , former idaho senator : " i am not gay			2
i have never been gay			2
" it 's those -- and hundreds of other priceless lines -- that make " @entity10 ! spin ! " unique			1
the entire play -- every word -- is taken verbatim from the news conferences , interviews , books , texts and , yes , tweets of those involved			1
" i realized i could never write the kinds of things that these guys actually said and have an audience believe them			0
and so that 's when i realized , it 's got to be verbatim , because that 's the only way for folks to see what these things are actually like , " said playwright @entity47			1
different male actors play each of the infamous politicians but starring alongside them is @entity58 alum @entity57 who plays all of the wounded wives , mistresses and other women			1
she portrays 16 characters during the 75 minute performance			0
" it pays far less than @entity58 , but it 's good for me because it 's , in general , my comfort zone			2
i started out [ at @entity69 's famed improve group ] @entity70 doing sketch , and so the idea of like switching characters is kind of something i 've been doing for a long time , " @entity57 told @entity67			1
in fact , it was n't the number of characters -- but rather what those characters were saying that first struck @entity57 about the script			1
" the thing i was most shocked at was the graphic nature of the talk			0
like you hear like , ' oh they were sexting , ' and then you see like what were they sexting and you 're like , ' whoa			0
' this is beyond any of my sexting skills , " @entity57 said			1
some of the exchanges -- especially messages sent by former @entity27 rep. @entity95 during the @entity97 scandal -- may not be fodder for a family website			0
but most of them confirm the suspicions of many ofthose already cynical about politics â€” that the main players somehow feel , no matter how they behave , they wo n't get caught			0
the difference between life and art in this instance is that the play pays as much attention to the aggrieved women as the offending men , nearly all of whom stood by their husbands during the scandals -- literally			1
@entity57 had to channel what they would have been thinking appearing at those awkward press conferences			1
" i imagine when the scandal hits , you know , maybe later they 're going to marinate on it and make your decisions			0
but when it hits you probably just want to like air on the side of ' i 'm going to believe what he says , i 'm going to keep the family together , blah blah blah , ' " she said			0
" i do n't know i could see myself doing that in a whirlwind press thing			0
i 'll put myself there or i 'll sort it all out later with a skilled therapist			0
" despite the starring role of infidelity , @entity47 -- a former @entity97 staffer -- says his play is more about power than sex			1
" i think a lot of us make mistakes in our personal lives , i know i have , but the reason we do n't take these crazy , sort of outlandish risks and expect to get away with them is because we do n't have power to protect us			0
but these guys are like , ' i 'm a member of @entity155 , of course this is not going to come back to me , i 've got a business card			0
' " that 's exactly what @entity29 showed to a police officer after being confronted inside a restroom at the @entity164 airport			2
spoiler alert : it did n't help .			0
