-- @entity1 officially closed on monday its village tribunals overseeing the prosecution of suspects in a 1994 genocide that left 800,000 dead , marking the end of more than a decade of local court prosecutions			1
government officials gathered in @entity9 over the weekend to formally mark the closure of the courts , known as the gacacas , which closed the last of its cases earlier this month			1
" what these courts achieved went beyond anyone 's expectations			2
they administered justice and united @entity1 at the same time , " @entity1 president @entity19 said in a statement posted on the gacacas website			1
" these courts were evidence of our ability to find solutions to challenges that seemed insurmountable			0
" the closing of the gacacas came on the heels of the last of the criminal prosecutions related to the genocide by the @entity36 , though appeals of @entity36 findings are expected to go through 2014			1
according to the @entity36 the leaders and masterminds of the genocide were tried by the criminal courts and the @entity36 , and civilians who contributed to attacks or loss of life directly or indirectly were sent to gacacas			1
@entity49 courts were introduced in the @entity51 nation after the april 1994 genocide			1
the victims were mostly from the @entity55 ethnic minority , who were targeted by @entity57 over a rivalry that dates to colonial days			0
some moderates from the @entity57 majority who supported @entity55 were also killed			0
the gacacas were originally formed to resolve minor disputes among villagers but were reinvented to hand out justice to the perpetrators of the genocide and help fast - track reconciliation efforts in the broken nation			2
the nation 's justice system and the @entity73 set up to try genocide suspects were overwhelmed , and handling all the cases in those courts would have taken hundreds of years , according to the president			2
@entity79 hearings were held in open fields in neighborhoods where the attacks occurred			2
there were no lawyers and no judges in robes			0
a panel of local villagers with no legal experience conducted the proceedings			0
more than 1.5 million cases were heard by the gacacas , according to estimates			1
critics of the gacacas said they did not meet international standards for a fair trial , while others said it exposed victims who testified to revenge attacks			0
but proponents of the system , which allows a victim to address the tribunal , said it reduced prison congestion and allowed survivors to hear first - hand what happened to their family members who were killed			0
@entity0 's @entity111 and @entity112 contributed to this report .			0
