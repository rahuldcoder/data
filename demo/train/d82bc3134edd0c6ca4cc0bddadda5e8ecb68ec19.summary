-- @entity1 was driving home in @entity3 , @entity4 , when he came to a fork in the road			1
no , an actual fork			1
the oversized kitchen utensil was 6 feet high , made of wood , painted silver and mounted in the concrete island at the intersection of @entity13 and @entity14 in south @entity3			1
@entity1 , a local photographer and a contributor to @entity16 , knew he had to pull over			1
" i actually laughed out loud in my truck and just knew i had to get some shots of this urban art before some city employee takes it down or it is vandalized , " he said			0
he shot some photos tuesday afternoon , posted them on @entity16 and left a post-it note on the sculpture in hopes of finding the artist			1
the literal fork in the road was short - lived			1
a city crew pulled it out of the concrete wednesday morning , saying in a statement that " although the fork in the road remains , the literal fork was removed this morning			1
we appreciate the creativity , but it 's not legal or safe to put objects like this on public streets or medians			2
" @entity0 affiliate @entity42 filmed the fork being taken away			1
@entity1 and other local residents , including the creator himself , are holding out hope that city officials will change their mind and return the quirky spectacle			0
@entity3 communications manager @entity50 told @entity0 , " if the artist would like to propose to donate this art to the city , we do have a process through our @entity55 to consider it			1
he or she could get in touch with us to learn more about this process			0
" before the fork was ripped out , @entity1 's post-it note made its way to the artist , who explained he was a retired teacher who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of getting fined or sued by the city			1
the 62 - year - old retired math and physics teacher said he has wanted to make a fork for that island ever since he saw " @entity77 " in 1979 , in which @entity69 tells @entity71 , on their way to @entity74 , to bear left if he comes to a fork in the road			1
a moment later , a giant upside - down fork appears in the road			1
that was more than 30 years ago , but he never had the time to work on the project until he retired in june			2
he spent the summer on it , laminating pieces of wood together until they resembled the kitchen utensil			0
he bought a can of chrome paint and sprayed the fork until the can was empty			2
his brother , a middle - school wood shop teacher in @entity92 , helped him smooth out the edges			2
" i 'm not an artist			0
i have no talent , but i 'm not afraid to try , and i 'm quite surprised that the fork came out as good as it did , " he said			2
with his 32 - year - old son 's help , they mounted it in the street on tuesday morning			0
knowing the city might object , they tried to stay discreet			0
he said they put on orange construction vests and cloaked the prongs in a black garbage bag while they installed it on the island			2
" we tried to look official , did n't make eye contract with anybody driving by			0
... it just looked like two construction workers putting up a sign post			0
and then when all the signs were gone , i removed the trash bag , and then people started taking pictures , " he said			2
he and his son got a few pictures and were surprised it created such a commotion when it was taken down			0
several news stations reported that neighbors wanted it put back			1
" i just thought a couple people would drive by and smile and keep on driving			0
i did n't think anything more was going to happen , " he said			0
" i ca n't afford to pay any fines , and i do n't want to get in trouble			0
it was just something i thought the folks in my neighborhood would appreciate , and apparently they did			0
" @entity134 said the placement of the fork would be considered a code violation			2
" we normally impose a fine only if there is a repeated problem and requests for voluntary compliance do n't work			0
" wednesday , soon after the fork was removed , a neighbor put up a sign that said " why the fork not ? " @entity1 shot a photo of that too and posted it on @entity16			1
" thank you for the laughs we all had looking at the @entity154 , " @entity1 told the artist			0
" hopefully , the city changes its mind and lets the @entity154 return , even for a week or so			0
" update : @entity1 reports thursday night that the " why the fork not ? " sign is gone , but people have been taping normal - sized forks to a nearby road sign			1
meanwhile , readers in the comments below tell us about a giant fork with a happy ending in another part of @entity4			1
in a similar guerilla art prank , an artist erected an 18 - foot tall , 500 - pound fork in the road in a @entity175 median in 2009			1
the city ordered it removed after 7 months ( which required a forklift ) , but in 2011 , it was properly permitted and permanently installed .			0
