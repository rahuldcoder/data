editor 's note : @entity2 is a professor of history and public affairs at @entity6 's @entity5			1
his new book , " @entity8 : the @entity9 -- from @entity11 to the @entity12 , " will be published this fall by @entity10			0
@entity2 writes widely about current events			2
@entity14 says some of president @entity16 's political vulnerabilities have started to emerge			1
@entity17 , @entity18 ( @entity19 ) -- june has been rough for president @entity16			1
after experiencing enormous success during his first months in office , some of his political vulnerabilities have started to emerge			0
as @entity25 begin to think about the 2010 midterm elections and moderate democrats decide how they should vote on @entity16 's most ambitious initiative , health care , the @entity30 must prevent these weaknesses from becoming debilitating			1
the first vulnerability is the tension between the left and center of the @entity36			0
since his election , president @entity16 has struggled to navigate the divisions that exist between the liberal base of the party , who were the core of his early support , and moderate @entity27 , who were also instrumental to his victory			1
at first , the administration relied on good will and political capital from the election to overcome conflicts , such as when @entity16 agreed to reductions in the size of the economic stimulus package to placate the conservative @entity27 and some @entity25 despite the objection of progressives			1
but the tensions are becoming more pronounced and more difficult to resolve			2
the president has disappointed gay rights activists for not fulfilling promises they thought he had made on the issue of gay rights			1
last week , they expressed their frustration with the @entity64 's legal brief supporting the @entity65 , a law that prohibits same - sex partners from receiving marriage benefits and protects states that do n't recognize same - sex marriages			0
@entity16 failed to calm the storm even when he extended some employment benefits to the same - sex partners of federal workers			2
he came under fire for having declined to provide health care and retirement benefits on the grounds that such a move would violate the @entity65			1
these kinds of left - center tensions will intensify when @entity82 delves into the final negotiations over health care this summer			1
@entity27 insist that without a public insurance option health care reform will fail in the long run			1
several @entity36 moderates have been pushing alternatives that fall far short of that goal			0
the second vulnerability is the deficit			0
when @entity25 have turned away from cultural issues and toward economics , they have been finding more success at attracting the interest of independents and moderates			0
recent polls have shown that the public is concerned about the growing size of the deficit and @entity25 have finally gained a bit of political traction by linking @entity16 's policies to the government 's red ink			1
to be sure , this is not a home run issue for the @entity25			0
many commentators have pointed to the hypocrisy of republicans making anti-deficit arguments following the tax - cutting and spending spree that took place under president @entity116			1
moreover , deficits have a poor track record in terms of being a winning campaign issue			0
there have not been any presidential candidates or major midterm elections in recent history that hinged on anti-deficit arguments			0
many presidents , including @entity126 , survived while growing the deficit			2
polls have shown the public is also notoriously fickle about how much weight it gives to the deficit as an issue , and is often misinformed about the actual size of the deficit			0
nonetheless , warning about rising deficits has been an effective tool for weakening the political strength of an incumbent administration			0
regardless of the economics of the issue , with some respected economists saying short - term deficits do n't matter , many @entity139 perceive the budget deficit as a symbol for whether a president is keeping federal spending under control			2
while @entity25 might not take back @entity82 by focusing on the deficit , they can erode @entity16 's political standing and make it more difficult for him to pass legislation			1
finally , there is the economy			0
the irony for @entity16 is that as the economy has stabilized , it has become a greater source of political danger			1
without an immediate crisis , voters are not as panicked and do n't feel as desperate for federal assistance			0
a growing number are more comfortable criticizing the administration 's economic policies			2
some @entity25 have picked up on this and have asked why the @entity139 needs to spend the stimulus money if the recession is almost over			0
at the same time , @entity16 is in a double bind : most experts agree that we will have a fragile economy in the foreseeable future , so voters wo n't be happy either			1
if there is any new dip in the economy , the public will blame president @entity16 rather than president @entity116			1
this is exactly what happened with the recession in 1937 , which @entity126 's opponents called the " @entity180 , " using the downturn to diminish the number of @entity184 liberals in the @entity30 and @entity185 in 1938			0
does this mean @entity16 is finished ? not at all			2
the same polls that reveal vulnerabilities show that @entity16 is still extremely popular with the public and most evidence suggests that he has good standing with congressional @entity27			1
but in recent weeks a candidate who was once seen as invincible is now seen as potentially vulnerable			0
this is when the sharks start to circle in @entity139 politics			0
the revelation of weakness gives republicans , as well as unhappy @entity27 , more confidence to challenge the @entity30			2
this is not what the president wanted right as he is trying to win support for his health care proposal and the rest of his budget			1
if the problems are not contained , they can also become the foundation for the @entity25 campaign for @entity82 in 2010			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity14 .			2

@entity14 : june has been a difficult month for president @entity16
he says divisions have grown among @entity27 on gay rights , health care
@entity2 says growing concern about deficit could blunt @entity16 's plans
he says a new dip in the economy would be blamed on @entity16 , not @entity116
