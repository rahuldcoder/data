-- over the course of five days , the @entity2 government -- led by the understated conservative prime minister @entity3 -- overcame two high hurdles in a dash to qualify for the austerity program set out by the so - called troika , made up of the @entity9 , the @entity10 and the @entity11			1
the first hurdle was the parliamentary vote last week , when the austerity measures were passed by just 153 votes out of 300			2
the second important vote took place in the wee hours of sunday night in @entity18 , this time with a comfortable margin of victory as 167 of 300 lawmakers voted for , in essence , more austerity			2
but in the spirit of a @entity2 tragedy , much political blood has been spilt along the way			1
those who voted against the measures were tossed out of the coalition parties , while members of the @entity32 abstained due to the labor reforms that were built into the overall plan			0
this has been a very messy process , with the troika leaning on the relatively new government to deliver what @entity2 had promised before the current administration came to power following the elections last june			1
in large part , the restructuring is now there and @entity2 is telling the troika : " show me the money			1
" the implicit agreement on the table : @entity2 delivers another $ 17 billion in cuts over two years from labor reforms and tops that off with a new 2013 budget			1
the troika then puts up the final instalment of $ 40 billion to avoid defaulting on bonds which start coming due november 16			0
but all of a sudden , there seems to be disagreement in the ranks and backlash from some eurozone member countries not happy with the measures			0
as one @entity2 ceo messaged me last night after our coverage of the vote : " we kept our side of the bargain ; we need to see delivery from the other side too			2
" the budget for 2013 makes for painful reading			1
a projected contraction of 4.5 % next year and a record sixth year of recession , with the economy shrinking more than 30 % in that time frame			1
public debt to @entity79 is due to increase to 189 % , having risen more than 50 % since this whole crisis started			0
unemployment last week hit a record 25.4 % with youth unemployment leaping to 58 %			0
another @entity2 executive i spoke with last night after the vote said the population has entered a new phase of acceptance			2
state workers have taken salary and pension cuts ranging from 15 % to 40 % , taxes on electric bills have soared , the retirement age has been bumped up to 67 years from 65 years			0
finally , the real shrinking of the state sector is taking place			0
the state payroll will fall by 125,000 between 2012 and 2016 through attrition and real layoffs			0
some of the special pay packages for certain ministries , such as the @entity102 , have been eliminated and salaries have been capped			0
some 40 senior employees at the @entity105 , the central bank , walked off the job for good in protest of the 5,000 euro salary cap			0
@entity109 was a long time coming , but it has happened			0
this is a critical time			0
some 70,000 workers took to the streets in central @entity2 last week for one last fight of resistance against the austerity			1
@entity3 said it was a vote " for " or " against " the isolation of @entity2			2
he was suggesting that @entity2 will soon see the flickering light at the end of the tunnel , with the full backing of @entity123 chancellor @entity122 after her recent , high profile public show of support in @entity18			2
political statements may be offered by the members of the eurozone this week , something the @entity2 technocratic finance minister @entity130 promised			1
one thing is abundantly clear at this stage			1
for the state workers who have taken salary hits and for the one million private sector workers who have lost their jobs due to economic depression : the cash lifeline needs to be delivered .			1

the @entity2 government has overcome two hurdles to qualify for the troika *'s* austerity program
but in the spirit of a @entity2 tragedy , much political blood has been spilt along the way
the budget for 2013 makes for painful reading , *including* a contraction of 4.5 % next year
but one thing is abundantly clear for @entity2 : the cash lifeline needs to be delivered
