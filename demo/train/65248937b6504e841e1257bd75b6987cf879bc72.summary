-- as far as we know , there are no @entity3 on @entity4			1
there are no sirens on @entity8 nor large , monolithic stargates floating just outside @entity9			0
and even if there were , they could n't see us			0
not in much detail , anyway			0
we 're more than a billion kilometers away			0
but we 're going to wave and smile at them anyway			1
at least , that 's the plan hatched by @entity15 and " @entity16 , " organized by @entity18 leader @entity17			2
on friday , the @entity19 -- serving humanity since 1997 and in orbit around the ringed giant since 2004 -- will take pictures of @entity4 and its rings during a solar eclipse			1
included in the images , though just the barest dot , will be our @entity28			2
@entity17 has high hopes for the extraterrestrial picture - taking , which will occur from 21:27 to 21:42 @entity31			2
( that 's 5:27 p.m. to 5:42 p.m. @entity33 in the @entity34 , subtracting an hour for each time zone to the west			0
) " i hope , at the appropriate time , that you stop what you 're doing , go outside , gather together with friends and family ... and marvel at your own existence and that of all life on @entity48 , " she writes on her website			1
" then , by all means , rejoice ! " @entity15 has a catchier name for the image shoot			0
the agency is calling it " @entity54			0
" the @entity55 is asking viewers to " wave at @entity4			1
" hubble telescope spots blue planet where it rains glass is there an astronomical point to such celebrating ? well , @entity15 points out , it 's not like @entity48 is often photographed from the far reaches of outer space			1
" opportunities to image @entity48 from the outer solar system are rare , " the agency says in its " @entity54 " press release			1
" since the @entity72 began , there have been only two images of @entity48 from the outer solar system			1
" the space agency is going to snap images from the other side of the solar system as well			2
@entity15 's messenger spacecraft is in orbit around @entity79 , and staffers " realized @entity48 is coincidentally expected to appear in some images taken in a search for natural satellites around @entity79 on july 19 and 20 , " @entity15 and @entity55 said in a press release			1
so @entity85 will take photos at 7:49 a.m. , 8:38 a.m. and 9:41 a.m. edt ( 11:49 , 12:38 and 13:41 utc ) on both days , @entity15 and @entity55 said			1
( yeah , the friday opportunity is gone , but you still have saturday for the salute to @entity79			2
) the release said that @entity15 was inspired , in part , by the @entity19 team			1
and maybe the ultimate point of all this should be more existential , anyway			0
on saturday , we 'll celebrate the 44th anniversary of the @entity98 moon landing			0
@entity99 and @entity101 's stroll on the moon 's surface is still considered one of the most amazing achievements in human history			0
as the @entity107 famously once said in a headline , " @entity109 * * * , @entity110 on f * * * * * * @entity111			0
" we have n't been back to the moon since 1972 , but the steady stream of space images from @entity15 and others still has the ability to make us contemplate the sheer wonder of it all			2
so , what can it hurt ? take a few minutes and smile and wave for @entity48			1
you never know who might be watching			0
