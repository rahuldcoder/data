-- @entity1 , businessman and ceo of @entity3 , knows a little something about money			1
@entity1 says president @entity6 is trying to solve the nation 's economic woes , but it 's " trial and error			1
" @entity1 spoke with @entity0 's @entity10 about whether there should be executive pay limits , if there should be a stimulus plan and when there could be an end to the economic downturn			1
the following is an edited portion of the interview			2
@entity10 : is @entity6 right or wrong to go after these executives with salary caps ? @entity1 : well , i think he 's absolutely right			1
billions of dollars is being given to banks and others			1
you know , once you start using taxpayer money , it 's a whole new game			2
so i absolutely think he 's right			0
@entity10 : what about the whole concept of bailouts ? @entity1 : well , it 's a little bit different			1
a lot of people are not in favor of bailouts			2
you know , we talked about all the different things going on in this country			0
let 's face it , @entity10 , we are in a depression			2
if they did n't do the bailout , you would be in depression no. 2 and maybe just as big as depression no. 1 , so they really had to do something			1
the problem is they 're giving millions and billions of dollars to banks and the banks are n't loaning it			1
if you are a prime customer of a bank and if you need 10 cents , you ca n't get it			2
the banks are out of business			2
now , billions of dollars has been given			2
they 're supposed to be loaning out that money and they 're using it for other purposes , so it is a real mess			1
@entity10 : if you were in the @entity68 , would you vote for the stimulus plan ? @entity1 : well , i 'd vote for a stimulus plan			1
i 'm not sure that all of the things in there are appropriate			0
some of the little toys that they have are not really appropriate , and they 're a little surprising that they seem to want it , because the publicity on it has been terrible			0
i would certainly vote for a stimulus , but i would really vote for banks having to loan out the money because they 're not doing that			1
@entity10 : in your adult career , have you ever seen it worse ? @entity1 : no , this is the worst ever			1
this is the worst i 've ever seen			0
1990 was a bad period of time , but this is far worse , and this is worse on a really global basis			0
i 'm looking at different countries			0
now they 're blaming us because of what happened			0
you know , why not blame the @entity102 ? but every country is in trouble			0
@entity10 : can you put the blame anywhere ? @entity1 : well , look , it 's something that , to a certain extent , happens			1
you go up , you go down			0
if you just look at the charts over the period of 150 years , you 've had good times ( and ) you 've had bad times			0
certainly , there 's been a lot of greed			0
there 's been a lot of stupidity			0
you know , like i say , today the banks do n't have money , they do n't loan money			1
but if you went to a bank two years ago and you wanted a $ 300 million loan , they 'd say ' no , we do n't want to do that , but we 'll give you $ 400 million , ' so i guess , to a certain extent , that 's part of the problem			2
@entity10 : if you had the power , if you could wield , what would you do ? @entity1 : well , the biggest problem we have is it 's trial and error , @entity10			1
i mean we 've never had anything like this before			0
it is absolute trial and error			1
the new president is trying			0
@entity145 left him with a mess -- a total mess in many different ways			0
i really think he 's doing the best he can , but it is trial and error			1
they try something , if it works , great			0
if it does n't work -- and the problem is you do n't really know if it 's going to work for quite some time			2
if it 's really wrong -- and it could be wrong -- we 're going to really have a mess in two years .			0

@entity1 : ' we are in a depression '
