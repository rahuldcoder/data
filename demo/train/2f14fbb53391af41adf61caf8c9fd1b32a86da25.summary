-- in the end , enigma swirled around @entity3 in death just as it had in life , the grisly details of his demise still emerging			1
@entity9 's new leaders said he was caught in a crossfire although several cell phone videos seemed to contradict that report			1
based on @entity14 officials , journalists , human rights monitors and witnesses , here is an account of how the strongman 's last day transpired			1
revolutionary fighters had cornered @entity3 loyalists in the @entity24 area of @entity25			1
there had been rumors that he was holed up in the city of his birth but speculation also held that he had fled to the desert			0
in any case , @entity14 surveillance drones and @entity36 commanders had been keeping an eye on @entity24 for a while and again on thursday morning , the drones were out			2
somewhere around 8:30 in the morning , according to a @entity14 official , a convoy of loyalists made a break from that part of @entity25 and headed west trying to get out of the city			1
@entity47 drones and @entity49 fighter jets struck the convoy , splitting it up and forcing the loyalists to scurry on foot			0
it 's not clear whether @entity3 was in that convoy but a @entity14 official said he was , though he was not directly hit			1
" two miles west of @entity25 , 15 pickup trucks mounted with machine guns lay burnt out , smashed and smoldering next to an electricity substation 20 meters from the main road , " reported the @entity59 news agency			2
the revolutionaries began shooting at the loyalists			0
" at first we fired at them with anti-aircraft guns , but it was no use , " @entity63 told @entity59			0
" then we went in on foot			0
" the ferocious firefight lasted three hours , said @entity69 , @entity70 's emergencies director , who is in @entity25			1
he said 95 bodies were found in the area			0
@entity3 survived and fled with a handful of his men			1
the revolutionaries eventually found him hiding in a drainage pipe			1
@entity78 fighter @entity77 told the @entity79 that @entity3 was bleeding from his head and chest but still was able to speak with his trademark indignation			2
@entity63 told @entity59 that @entity3 was wounded with gunshots in his leg and back			2
some accounts described him as confused			0
others said he pleaded for his life			0
" when he saw us , he said , ' what 's happening ? those were the words he spoke , " @entity77 told the @entity79			0
there were bodies strewn about the 70 - feet long chunk of drab , concrete tubing that passed under a road			0
on it , graffiti scribbled in blue lettering read : " this is the place of the rat , @entity3			2
" it was , of course , @entity3 who called the rebels rats from the very start of @entity9 's uprising in february			1
they had finally caught him			0
now it was @entity3 , the self - styled " king of kings " of @entity111 who was caught like a rat amid rubbish and rocks and sand he was captured alive			1
but that 's when the stories diverge			0
the @entity36 's leadership says @entity3 was killed in crossfire between revolutionary fighters and the remnants of loyalists in @entity25			1
@entity124 , a senior member of the council , told @entity0 that @entity3 was being transported to @entity78 to the northwest			2
" they were taking him to a hospital , " he said			0
in the hail of gunfire , @entity124 said , @entity3 was shot in the feet and then in his head			2
" i can not tell you whether it was from far or near , but it was unintentional , " he said			0
" no one decided to kill him or slaughter him			0
it would have been much better for us @entity9 and the whole universe to capture him and take him to a court			2
" but cell phone videos and other accounts seem to contradict @entity124 's statement			0
and questions remain about when and exactly how @entity3 died			2
one man told the @entity145 that he saw @entity3 being shot with a 9mm gun in the abdomen at around 12:30 p.m. that was four hours before the @entity36 's executive board chairman @entity150 announced that @entity3 was dead			1
@entity151 , a doctor who allegedly performed dna tests on @entity3 's body friday , told @entity155 television that @entity3 was shot in the head and stomach			1
@entity69 said he did not believe @entity3 was killed in crossfire			2
from what @entity70 has learned , @entity69 said @entity3 did not have a gunshot wound in his head when he was captured			1
" he was taken into the streets , " he said			0
" enraged crowds started beating him , pulling his hair			0
they tried to put him on a hood of a car and drive him away			0
" in a shaky amateur video , a bloodied @entity3 is seen alive and being hoisted onto a truck			1
another , obtained by the @entity170 network , showed his corpse on the ground , a bullet wound in his head			0
a third piece of footage posted on @entity178 showed fighters grabbing @entity3 's tangled curls and jerking his head about			1
" it certainly was a very humiliating end for @entity3 , " @entity69 said			1
" but when he left this area he was very much alive			0
" the the different versions of how @entity3 met his end prompted the @entity185 as well as @entity70 and @entity186 to ask for investigations			1
@entity69 said an autopsy on his body ought to be internationally supervised			0
for weeks , the revolutionaries had been on the forefront of the battle for @entity25 , struggling to wrest control of the coastal city from the last vestiges of the old regime in brutal urban warfare			1
thursday , when the fight was finally won , they could finally claim liberation for their nation			0
they waved @entity3 's golden gun in the air			1
the revolutionaries also took @entity3 's satellite phone , his brown scarf and one black boot , the @entity79 reported , to keep as ultimate trophies of their victory			1
but their first day of freedom , said @entity69 , is now blemished with the suspicious circumstances of the former tyrant 's death			1
friday , @entity3 's bloody , battered body lay on a mattress in a @entity78 market cold storage room , @entity59 reported			1
the news agency showed video of curious onlookers snapping pictures with their mobile phones			0
it was unclear when and how he would be put to rest , even though @entity225 rites require burial within 24 hours			0
@entity227 , the @entity36 's information minister , told @entity0 that a funeral would be postponed for a few days just in case officials from the @entity230 -- which had an arrest warrant out for @entity3 for alleged crimes against humanity -- wanted to see the body firsthand			2
in his 42 years in power , @entity3 embraced eccentric tactics and cold - blooded violence , meting out cruel forms of punishment to those he perceived as his enemies			2
he should have faced justice in court , many @entity9 as well as human rights activists said			1
instead , he was like many of his victims whose ignominious end raised plenty of questions .			0

@entity3 was in a convoy heading out of @entity25 that was hit by @entity14
@entity3 survived and hid in a drainage pipe
he was alive when he was captured , say @entity256 fighters
a human rights investigator says his brutal end is a blemish on @entity9 's first day of freedom
