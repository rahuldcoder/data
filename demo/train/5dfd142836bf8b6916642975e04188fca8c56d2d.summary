-- the relationship between @entity3 and the @entity5 is " the most important " bilateral relationship in the world , a former @entity3 foreign ministry official said monday			1
@entity8 , now the director of the @entity9 , told @entity0 's @entity10 that the @entity5 should deal with @entity11 " with respect " and not be " too abrasive			1
" " that 's the minimum thing we can ask for , i believe , " he said on the eve of talks between president @entity15 and @entity3 president @entity16			0
@entity8 pointed out that @entity3 is now the @entity5 ' largest creditor nation , holding foreign reserves of more than $ 2 trillion , about two - thirds of which are assets that are denominated in @entity5 dollars			1
" @entity3 - @entity5 relations are the most important bilateral relations in the world , " @entity8 said			1
@entity15 appears keen to put past @entity5 - @entity3 disagreements behind him as he seeks @entity3 cooperation on a host of issues from the global economy and climate change to nuclear proliferation			2
he 's also looking to @entity3 for leadership on how to deal with repressive regimes such as @entity35 and @entity36 , both of which are friends of @entity11 and major energy suppliers to @entity3			1
critics of the @entity5 president say he is downplaying what was once a central tenet of @entity5 foreign policy , the promotion of human rights and democracy , in order to persuade @entity3 to help the @entity5 achieve its foreign policy goals			2
but @entity15 insists @entity5 " will never waver in speaking up for the fundamental values that we hold dear			0
" @entity8 acknowledged global concern about @entity3 's human rights record , admitting the situation is not perfect			2
" but if you look at today 's human rights issues , and comparing that with what we had 30 years ago , 20 years ago , or 10 years ago , then @entity3 has made great improvements , " he said			0
@entity8 said @entity3 and the @entity3 people are great admirers of @entity5			1
but he said , " @entity3 's foreign policy is underlined by the principle of non-interference in each other 's internal affairs			0
if it is only up to the @entity5 to discuss human rights issues in @entity3 , this is unbalanced			2
" he also tried to reassure critics in the @entity5 , some of whom have accused @entity3 of manipulating its currency to keep the cost of @entity3 goods artificially low , about the impact of @entity3 's rapidly expanding economic power			2
by some estimates , @entity3 's economy will be the same size as the @entity5 economy by 2025 , though there will still be a huge gap in economic output per person			0
" let me make the record straight			0
over the past few months since the outbreak of the financial crisis , @entity3 has continued to purchase @entity91 bonds issued by the @entity5 government , rather than reducing them in any way , " he said			0
" so i think the @entity5 people need to realize that @entity3 has applied a very steady hand and very responsible hand in dealing with issues involving the dollar			0
" @entity8 said @entity3 has no desire to be an enemy of the @entity5			1
" both @entity3 and the @entity5 need to give each other due respect and need to incentivize each other			1
and then we can work together towards a better peace and better world			0
