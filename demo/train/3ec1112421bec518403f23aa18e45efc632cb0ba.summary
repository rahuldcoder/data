-- @entity1 have one foot in the @entity3 semifinals after fighting back from going a goal down at @entity5 to beat @entity6 rivals @entity7 3 - 1 in their quarterfinal first leg on wednesday			1
@entity1 players celebrate @entity11 's equalizer on their way to a stunning win at @entity5			1
the @entity15 side knocked @entity7 out of the competition at the last four stage last year and they look set to repeat that feat this season , despite going behind to an early goal from @entity21			1
with just five minutes on the clock , @entity22 fed @entity24 with a clever back - heel and when the full - back delivered his low cross an unmarked @entity21 applied the perfect finish			2
@entity29 squandered a gilt - edged chance to equalize seconds later			2
fellow - @entity33 @entity32 slipped the ball into his path but @entity29 's shot was kept out by goalkeeper @entity37			0
@entity29 wasted another clear chance to level in the 28th minute after @entity40 's low cross had allowed the striker to shake off @entity42 -- but he blazed the ball high over the bar from just eight yards out			0
@entity1 continued to press forward and their effort paid off in the 38th minute when @entity11 equalized with an unmarked header from @entity48 's corner			1
the second half saw much of the same with @entity7 on the back - foot as @entity1 pressed forward and they nearly added a second in the 51st minute when @entity53 's pass put @entity29 clear again			1
this time the striker 's shot beat @entity37 but @entity42 managed to scamper back to clear the goal - bound effort for a corner			0
@entity7 briefly threatened when @entity21 fired over the bar from an acute angle and @entity1 suffered a blow when captain @entity62 received a yellow card for a late challenge on @entity37 , meaning he will be suspended for the second leg at @entity66 next week			1
however , @entity68 's side may not now need their inspirational leader after two goals in six second - half minutes stunned the home supporters			0
in the 61st minute , the @entity7 defense again went missing to allow @entity11 to socre a carbon - copy header , this time from @entity53 's corner			1
then in the 67th minute , a quick break from @entity48 saw his superb low left - wing cross turned home by @entity29 from close - range			2
from then on , @entity1 were in cruise control and a dispirited @entity7 could have fallen further behind had @entity48 and @entity32 converted last chances for the visitors			2
with @entity83 thrashing @entity84 4 - 0 in wednesday 's other match , a @entity1 v @entity83 semifinal looks assured unless @entity7 manage an unlikely win next week			1
@entity7 manager @entity88 acknowledged it will be " very difficult " for his team to overturn the deficit at @entity66			0
he told @entity92 : " clearly it will be very difficult -- but anything can happen			0
we have to play well and score three goals and have a very good game against a very good team			0
" the @entity99 continued : " i felt we started really well but after the goal we did n't pass the ball properly			0
we were giving the ball away , and they were passing it well			0

@entity1 fight back to beat @entity7 3 - 1 in their @entity3 quarterfinal
@entity11 ( 2 ) and @entity29 give the @entity15 side a vital *advantage*
@entity7 had taken a fifth - minute lead when @entity21 fired them ahead
