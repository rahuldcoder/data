-- @entity2 's chief federal judge has offered his apologies for forwarding a racist e-mail aimed at president @entity5			1
@entity7 advocacy groups demanded that @entity9 district judge @entity8 resign			1
@entity13 , in an interview wednesday with the @entity12 newspaper , offered his regrets for forwarding the e-mail , saying it was " a hard lesson to learn			0
" " to say it 's inappropriate and stupid is an extreme understatement , " @entity8 said in courthouse chambers on wednesday , according to the newspaper			1
" there is no doubt it 's racist			1
it was n't forwarded for that purpose			1
if anything , it was political			1
" the @entity28 - based judge was named to the bench by president @entity30 in 2001			1
he has been chief judge since 2008 , overseeing two other full - time district judges , three senior or part - time judges and five magistrates			1
his chambers did not return a call from @entity0 for comment			0
@entity13 did not write the offensive material , but admitted forwarding the february 20 message to a few friends after it was sent to him by his brother			0
the @entity44 newspaper was given a copy and reported the message went : " normally i do n't send or forward a lot of these , but even by my standards , it was a bit touching			2
i want all of my friends to feel what i felt when i read this			0
hope it touches your heart like it did mine			0
" a little boy said to his mother , ' @entity57 , how come i 'm black and you 're white ? ' his mother replied , ' do n't even go there @entity5 ! from what i can remember about that party , you 're lucky you do n't bark ! ' " @entity5 is of mixed race			2
@entity8 said in the interview his conduct in court over many years has shown he is not a racist , but he admitted the public got that impression from the e-mail			1
" and i do n't blame them , " he added			2
the judge also separately told the @entity44 , " the only reason i can explain it to you is i am not a fan of our president , but this goes beyond not being a fan			2
i did n't send it as racist , although that 's what it is			1
i sent it out because it 's anti-obama			0
" some legal organizations said the apology was not enough			0
" if he has any respect for his office and for ideals of equality and human dignity on which our country was founded , judge @entity8 will step down today , " said @entity88 , president and ceo of the left - leaning nonprofit @entity90			1
" the message he has acknowledged circulating demonstrates a lack of judicial temperament that ought to disqualify him from further service			0
" it 's rare and generally very difficult to force federal judges from office			0
they receive tenure , and the @entity107 guarantees they can remain on the bench " during good behavior			0
" standards warranting removal are not clear , beyond a violation of civil or criminal law			0
@entity115 would have to initiate impeachment proceedings , but the few judges to face that have usually resigned before those proceedings went far			0
there is no indication the judge in @entity2 would be subjected to either option .			2

district judge @entity8 calls *action* " inappropriate and stupid "
it was n't meant to be racist , he says ; it was political
he should resign , the left - leaning nonprofit @entity90 says
