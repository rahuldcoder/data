-- i come from a place where the sky is always grey , where flowers are always grey , and where television is still in black and white			0
i actually come from a world where color does n't exist ; i was born with achromatopsia , i was born completely colorblind			1
so i 've never seen color , and do n't know what it looks like			1
but since the age of 21 , i can hear color			1
in 2003 , after studying fine arts and while studying music at @entity14 in @entity15 , i began a project with computer scientist @entity17 with the aim of extending my senses			1
the result , with further collaborations with @entity21 and @entity22 , is an electronic eye : a color sensor between my eyes connected to a chip installed at the back of my head that transforms color frequencies into sound frequencies that i hear through my bone			1
watch @entity34 's @entity33 i 've had the electronic eye permanently attached to my head and i 've been listening to colors nonstop since 2004			1
so i find it completely normal now to hear colors all the time			1
at first , i had to memorize the sound of each color , but after some time this information became subliminal , i did n't have to think about the notes , color became a perception			1
and after some months , color became a feeling			2
i started to have favorite colors and i started to dream in color			1
when i started to hear colors in my dreams , i noticed that my brain and the software had united and given me a new sense			1
my brain was creating electronic sounds in my dreams , not the device			1
that was the point when i started to feel no difference between the software and my brain : the cybernetic device had become an extension of my brain -- an extension of my senses			1
i started to feel like a cyborg : the cybernetic eye was no longer a device but a part of my body			1
after some time it even became a part of my official image			0
you are not allowed to appear with any electronic equipment on the @entity72 passport photo , but i insisted that what they were seeing was not a piece of electronic equipment but a new part of my body			0
since i started to hear color , my life has changed dramatically			2
art galleries have become concert halls ; i can hear a @entity82 or a @entity83 or an @entity84			0
and supermarkets have become like night clubs			0
i love how they sound , especially the aisles with cleaning products			0
@entity33 : we are all cyborgs now the way i dress has also changed			0
before , i used to dress in a way that looked good , now i dress in a way that sounds good			2
if i 'm happy i dress in a major chord			0
if i 'm sad i dress in a minor chord			0
so if i need to go to a funeral , i might dress in b minor ( that 's turquoise , purple and orange )			2
my sense of beauty has also changed			2
someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible , and someone might sound very harmonious but look awful			0
so i find it really exciting to create sound portraits of people			0
instead of drawing the shape of someone 's face i write down the different notes i hear when i look at them , and then i send them an mp3 of their face			2
i can even give face concerts now , concerts where i play the audience faces			0
the good thing about doing this is that if the concert does n't sound good , it 's their fault			1
i also found out that things i thought were colorless are not colorless at all			0
cities are not grey , @entity129 is amber terracotta , @entity127 is yellow turquoise , @entity126 is very golden red ... and humans are not black and white			0
human skins range from light shades of orange to very dark shades of orange , we are never white or black			0
after some time , an unexpected secondary effect appeared			0
i started to perceive normal sounds as color too			1
telephone tones started to sound green , the @entity145 pips became turquoise , and listening to @entity148 became a yellow experience , even people 's voices had dominant colors			1
so i started to paint the colors of music and the colors of voices			2
@entity33 : @entity155 on the accelerating power of technology there was a point when i was able to perceive 360 different colors , one for each degree of the color wheel			1
i was able to perceive colors just as well as people with color vision			1
then i realized that the human visual system is not very impressive : you ca n't actually see many colors ; there are many more colors around us that the human eye ca n't detect			1
so i just decided to continue extending my color perception and included infrared and ultraviolet into the color - to - sound scale			2
so now i can also perceive infrared , which means i can hear if there are movement detectors in a room , or if someone is pointing at me with a remote control			0
the good thing about hearing ultraviolet is that you can hear if it 's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe			1
ultraviolet is a dangerous color , a color that can kill us , so it would be useful for all of us to be able to perceive it			2
we should all have the wish to extend our senses			2
if we compare ourselves with other animals , our senses are very limited			2
some birds can see ultraviolet , dogs can hear ultrasounds , rats can smell much better than us , sharks can detect electromagnetic fields , dolphins can hear through their bones , bats can see through sound			0
@entity33 : the rise of human - computer cooperation by becoming cyborgs we have the chance to extend our perception to the level of other animal species			0
we focus so much on extending our knowledge and focus so little on extending our senses			2
no matter how much i knew about color , as long as i could n't sense color , color made no sense to me			1
knowledge comes from our senses : if we extend our senses , we extend our knowledge			0
we are the first generation that does n't need to wait for natural evolution to evolve ; we can evolve during our lifetime			1
there 's no need to create new superpowers			0
so becoming a cyborg is not about becoming like a machine			0
it 's not about becoming less human ; it 's about bringing us closer to other animals and to nature			0
it 's about awakening our senses , our instincts , our intuition ... qualities that we seem to have lost due to our constant use of technology as an external tool and not as part of our body			1
life will be much more exciting when we stop creating apps for our mobile phones and we start creating apps for our own body			0
you wo n't be alone			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity34 .			1

@entity34 was born colorblind but now perceives color through hearing
he wears a device that produces sounds based on frequencies of colors
@entity34 says he 's become a cyborg , with a color sense beyond the average
he says we do n't need evolution to *increase* our senses , technology can do it
