@entity0 , @entity1 -- just hours after the island took a beating from @entity6 , blue skies returned to @entity1 monday as the storm moved out into the @entity8 and toward @entity9 , @entity10			1
" it 's a different world , so to speak , " @entity2 meteorologist @entity11 said , reporting from @entity1			0

as it neared @entity1 , its eyewall collapsed , weakening it slightly , @entity11 said			0
winds gusted to 93 mph ( 149 kph ) on the tiny @entity8 island as @entity6 raged			2
because @entity1 -- which is actually a collection of islands -- is so small , " they do n't get direct hits very often , " said @entity2 meteorologist @entity54 , " and they got hit pretty hard			0
" as day dawned , however , many on @entity1 felt they had dodged a bullet , despite widespread power outages -- at one point , it was estimated that two - thirds of the island 's 67,000 residents were without electricity -- some flooding in low - lying areas , downed trees and branches and closed roads			0
some lacking power may not have it restored for weeks , @entity11 said			0
the storm 's northeast quadrant , typically where the highest winds and rain are experienced , took aim at the southern part of the island , where several resorts are located			0

@entity6 is a large storm , with hurricane - force winds extending up to 85 miles ( 140 kilometers ) from the center and tropical storm - force winds extending outward up to 380 miles ( 610 kilometers ) outward			1
a tropical storm warning has been issued for the coast of @entity9 from @entity94 's cove to @entity95 , forecasters said			1
the warning , in this case , means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the area within 24 hours			1
large swells are expected to continue affecting the @entity102 of the @entity39 through tuesday and could cause " life - threatening surf and rip currents , " the hurricane center said			1
swells associated with @entity6 are expected to subside over the next couple of days in @entity107 , the @entity108 , @entity109 and portions of the @entity111			2
out in the @entity8 , @entity112 had lost its tropical characteristics by mid-morning monday , according to the @entity26 's last advisory issued on the storm			2
as of 11 a.m. et , the remnants of @entity112 were located about 1,100 miles ( 1,770 kilometers ) west of the @entity117			0
its maximum sustained winds were at 45 mph ( 75 kph ) , and it was moving east at about 8 mph ( 13 kph )			0
