-- two journalists in @entity2 have been released on bail in a controversial defamation case that has raised concerns over press freedom in the country			1
@entity9 journalist and editor of news website @entity11 , @entity13 and his @entity2 colleague @entity15 , appeared in court thursday over a report connecting military personnel to human trafficking			1
@entity21 's provincial court ruled that the case should proceed and set the first hearing for may 26			1
if found guilty , the pair face jail time of up to seven years and a fine of around $ 3,000 each			0
the charges , which were brought by the @entity2 navy , relate to an article that @entity11 , a small news website in the province of @entity21 , published on its website in july last year			1
the report included information from a @entity35 investigative piece that alleged some @entity2 security forces , including navy personnel and police , have been profiting from the smuggling of ethnic @entity41 people fleeing violence in neighboring @entity43			1
@entity35 won a @entity44 for its coverage of the plight of the @entity41 monday			0
the @entity47 filed criminal defamation and computer crimes charge against the @entity11 reporters in december , accusing them of knowingly publishing false information and committing slander			1
but other @entity2 news organizations that quoted the @entity35 reporting at the center of the case have not been charged , according to @entity56			1
the navy filed a criminal complaint against @entity35 , but the news agency has also not been charged , a @entity35 spokesperson said thursday			1
" to our understanding , the complaint is under review by the authorities , " she said			0
the fact that @entity11 appears to have been singled out for legal action has raised concerns among press freedom advocates that the lawsuit is an attempt to silence the small news site , which has been covering the @entity41 's movements in @entity2 for a number of years			1
" we 're keen to get back to what we were doing and that was reporting the @entity41 as an issue , " @entity13 told @entity0 thursday			0
" what 's happened is that we 've been diverted by this case to writing about ourselves			2
so we really have n't been able to cover the @entity41 issue the way we were once able to , and that 's disappointing , and one of the ramifications of the foolishness of this particular lawsuit			0
" @entity13 and @entity15 were detained in separate cells at the @entity21 provincial court for around five hours thursday while officials made arrangements for bail			2
" we lost our freedom			2
that is a terrible thing , " said @entity15 after the pair were released			0
a local advocacy group , the @entity98 community rights and legal aid center provided the bail of 100,000 baht ( around $ 3,000 ) for each journalist			2
the case against @entity56 has been condemned by the @entity103 and prominent human rights groups , who say that imprisonment is a disproportionate punishment for defamation			1
@entity109 said the navy should allow authorities to investigate the allegations of trafficking and other mistreatment of @entity41 migrants			2
" the trial of these two journalists is unjustified and constitutes a dark stain on @entity2 's record for respecting media freedom , " @entity116 , @entity117 director for @entity109 said in an emailed statement thursday			1
" the @entity47 should have debated these journalists publicly if they had concerns with the story rather than insisting on their prosecution under the draconian @entity129 and criminal libel statutes , " @entity116 said			2
@entity13 , 66 , who is originally from @entity131 , has been in @entity21 for 11 years where he produces @entity11 and also freelances for international media , including @entity0 , the @entity133 and the @entity134			0
he worked for @entity0 as @entity117 deputy editor from 2001 to 2002			0
@entity15 , 33 , has worked as a fixer for several international media organizations whose staff have traveled to @entity21 and nearby regions to cover the @entity41 issue , including @entity35			0
" these two journalists have done more than most to report accurately from @entity2 the plight of @entity41			1
they have also rendered invaluable assistance to journalists at @entity35 and other local and foreign media organizations attempting to report this humanitarian crisis , " the @entity142 of @entity2 said in a statement			1
" the legal action also seriously damages the image of @entity2 and claims it may make to supporting freedom of speech and fair comment			1
" @entity2 ranks 130th out of 180 countries in the latest @entity155 press freedom index			1
@entity156 ¯ l , the head of the organisation 's @entity159 desk described the case as " absurd			0
" " if the navy want to dispute the @entity35 special report , which has just won a @entity44 , it can publicly give its version of events and demand the right of reply , " he said			0
@entity56 congratulated @entity35 for their recent award but has been disappointed by the company 's response to the defamation case			2
a @entity35 spokesperson said thursday that @entity15 was employed " in a very limited role to help make appointments , " and she was not a part of the team who reported and investigated the stories that were awarded the @entity44 in international reporting			0
" we oppose the use of criminal laws to sanction the press -- large or small , local or international -- for publication on matters of public interest , like the @entity41 , " the spokesperson said			0
the @entity2 navy has denied any involvement in people smuggling			1
a navy official , who asked not to be named , told @entity0 in december that the navy did not intend to obstruct or threaten any media , but they were seeking to protect the organization from false allegations			1
the navy could not be reached for comment for this story			0
@entity13 is still hopeful that the @entity2 government will intervene and the case will be dropped before may 26 when he and @entity15 are due to appear in court again			1
" it all comes down to what constitutes democracy , " he said			0
" the media is a very important part of most democracies , and the military should n't be able to sue the media over this kind of issue			0
" boatloads of @entity41 fleeing ethnic and religious violence in @entity43 have arrived in @entity2 in recent years			2
reports of @entity41 ending up in camps where they are held at ransom , beaten , killed or sold as laborers have been documented by @entity218 and media organizations			0
the @entity2 government says it is committed to combating human trafficking but denies that the @entity41 are victims of trafficking			2
it says that they are migrants who consent to being smuggled .			0
