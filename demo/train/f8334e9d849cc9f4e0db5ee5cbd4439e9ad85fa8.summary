-- when i was a kid , i was obedient and quiet			1
i automatically knew that talking too loud , making a fuss or being assertive would never fly			2
i did what i was told			2
i was a @entity4 girl			1
i adhered to my parents ' wishes that i get top grades and perform well in the activities they had chosen for me			1
but after all the hours of homework , grueling afternoons of practicing arpeggios on the piano to perfection , four hours of @entity4 school after regular school , @entity4 calligraphy lessons with the stiff brush and stinky ink , after the chores , basketball practice and memorization of @entity4 poems , eventually i wanted to feel known for myself , not just my accomplishments			1
in the song " in my room , " @entity24 of the @entity25 sang , " ... do my dreaming and my scheming , laugh at yesterday			2
" obviously , he was n't @entity4			1
when you are a kid in hyperdrive , daydreaming and lying on your bed doing nothing does n't fit into the schedule			1
it did n't occur to my parents to ask for my opinion			1
that might promote individual thinking			2
and thinking for oneself is not part of the plan			2
@entity4 culture emphasizes acting according to your place in the family -- you are the @entity49 , third daughter , @entity51 or maybe just another mouth to feed			1
everyone has a part to play , and if you do n't like the role you 've been given , the mandate is still " do n't make trouble			2
" you do n't make trouble , and you study like crazy because in the really old days , passing the imperial exams was your only ticket out of poverty			2
and since the time of @entity64 , individuality is considered counterrevolutionary			2
speaking up about injustice could get you and your whole lot exiled			0
sure , many asian - americans are several generations away from those threats			0
yet , some collective memories do n't ever seem to fade			0
@entity4 parents who rock the @entity73 style still cling to the remnants of the @entity75 by expecting obedience above all else and stifling true creativity in favor of tried and true benchmarks of success : perfect grades , best test scores , admission into top colleges			1
what 's so bad about that ? to earn straight @entity88 for two decades in a row , i learned to detach from my own emotions and physical body			0
i disregarded my cramping fingers , tired eyes and grumbling stomach			0
having fun with friends had to wait			0
through consistent pressure to succeed , i learned that human connections were an obstacle and distraction			0
the only semblance of approval i received was when i won an award or had a perfect report card			1
achieving @entity105 was the only goal , and it did n't matter if the pursuit of perfection required that i ignore or step over someone else			0
all that mattered was the @entity111 after so many years of performing like a robot , by the age of 25 , a lot of kids who grew up like me have no idea how to connect with other people			1
we never bonded with friends in endless games of kick - the - can or went to birthday parties or listlessly congregated in the halls with the " bad " kids			2
we knew better than to waste our time like that			0
plus , we might catch stupid that way			0
as the children and grandchildren of immigrants , we may not have been starving for actual food , but we are starved for affection			0
in the pursuit of high achievement , our feelings got left by the side of the road , our emotions mistaken as unnecessary baggage			0
maybe our parents who escaped war and poverty never expected that later in the journey , we would need emotional availability and a sense of humor as flotation devices			1
as for me , the anxiety and loneliness of childhood that i describe in my book , " @entity154 , " has caused an uproar in my family			0
it 's the roar of a @entity4 kid saying enough is enough			1
it 's me as a @entity4 person saying i want to be seen as an individual			1
the world sees stereotypes of waitress or @entity73 , but even within my own ethnicity , i am also supposed to fit into a box -- that of obedient child			1
i 'm a 43 - year - old writer and mom , raising my kid with more hugs and affection that i ever had			2
growing up in @entity172 with frequent trips to @entity174 , i interacted with newly arrived @entity4 as well as third - and fourth - generation @entity175 who spoke without accents			1
but no matter what our ages or how americanized we were or were not , everybody seemed to know that nothing good could come from stirring up the melting pot. the fact that i am now purposely " making trouble " has opened up @entity185			0
my parents , brothers and other relatives are stumbling around , trying to stuff my words , anecdotes and remembrances of the past back into the locked @entity4 box			1
but it 's too late			0
while we were cramming to learn @entity195 or @entity196 , we forgot to learn the vocabulary of the foreign language of our feelings			0
we do n't know the words for " i 'm sorry " or even " i love you			0
" but now that i have stirred the pot a little , all is not lost			0
i remember that when @entity205 opened the box , there was one tiny thing that was the last to fly out into the world , and that was @entity209			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			1

@entity212 : as a @entity4 kid growing up , i was obedient and quiet
@entity212 : parents who rock the @entity73 style expect kids to get perfect grades
she says in pursuing @entity222 , she grew up having no idea how to connect with other people
@entity212 : @entity226 should *foster* true creativity and nurture emotional and *social* *iq*
