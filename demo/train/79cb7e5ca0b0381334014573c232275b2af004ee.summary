saturday , @entity3 said he wanted to rebuild , but was at a loss on how he could make that happen			1
" we do n't have a source of revenue			0
this hotel was the source of our revenue			2
all we 've worked for our whole life			2
and it 's gone , " he said			0
still , he tossed around options			0
an outbuilding that served as a kitchen survived			2
maybe he could build around that			2
and there 's a swimming pool that was just about complete			0
that was something to work with			0
and there was the hope and faith that had let him live his dream , if only for a few short months			0
