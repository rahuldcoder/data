-- for three decades or so , @entity2 artist @entity1 has been painting pensive , haunting images -- all of which are titled " dream "			1
the somber paintings typically depict a downcast , lone woman , painted in shades of gray or muted colors			0
a celebrated painter , @entity1 had seen his works acquired by the @entity2 @entity14 and the national museum in @entity16			1
but he now lives in @entity17 , joining over two million fellow citizens who fled overseas to escape the brutal civil war			1
when @entity1 moved to the @entity20 in 2012 , he left behind most of his belongings , including many of his " dream " paintings , at his @entity16 home			2
" i left with only one small bag , thinking i 'd return to @entity2 after a short time , " says the 53 - year - old artist			2
art collector @entity28 and his cousin @entity29 , who run @entity30 in @entity17 , helped @entity1 -- and later his paintings -- leave @entity2			1
the cousins first opened the gallery in @entity16 in 2006 , but the conflict had forced them to move the headquarters to @entity17 around three years ago			2
between 2011 and 2013 , the @entity36 and their team helped more than a dozen @entity2 artists relocate overseas , providing them with visas and airfare , and moved about 3,000 artworks to @entity17			1
" the moment when trouble started happening in @entity2 , we decided that we needed to plan because if this thing turned ugly , we 're not going to have time to do this later , " says @entity28			2
they also helped 33 - year - old artist @entity47 escape to @entity17 in september 2011			1
his work " @entity49 " -- a digitally manipulated image of @entity52 's painting " @entity53 " superimposed on a photograph of a bomb - ravaged wall in @entity2 -- went viral last year after the @entity56 in @entity57 shared it on @entity59			2
moving artists and their artworks to safe havens such as @entity63 , @entity17 and @entity64 is a costly operation , but @entity29 says it is worth it			1
" we feel like we 're a family in @entity69 , " he says			0
" so it was never an option that we 're going to cut our ties and move on			0
" but it 's not just about rescuing @entity2 artistic and cultural treasures , it 's also about money			0
@entity77 art is big business , and @entity17 is a hub , hosting the region 's largest modern art fair			0
on the first day of @entity17 last month , @entity30 sold a " dream " painting by @entity1 for $ 150,000			1
" more and more , we 're seeing people engage with artists who are producing work in conflict areas , " says @entity84 , art collector and director of @entity17 - based @entity86			1
" it 's because they have a message , it 's because they 're reflecting back what 's happening in the regions			0
essentially , they 're holding a mirror back to society and saying , ' this is what 's going on around me			0
do you see what i see ? " @entity1 and @entity47 are now living in the safe haven of @entity17 , but they are still troubled by the bloodshed and destruction in @entity2			1
@entity1 's more - recent " dream " paintings hint at the atrocities back home : a woman staring at rows of bodies , a body squeezed into a small box			0
@entity47 , whose artworks focus on the devastation back home , says : " i am a completely different person now in my life and my art -- everything has changed			0
" @entity124 contributed to this report .			0

it also moved over 3,000 artworks out of @entity2
