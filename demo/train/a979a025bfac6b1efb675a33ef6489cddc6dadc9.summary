spring hill , @entity1 -- the town that @entity4 put on the map is worried about its future and its residents hope the auto plant and jobs wo n't go the way of its most famous product			1
the move to shut down @entity4 has left some in @entity14 , @entity1 , disappointed and perplexed			1
@entity15 announced this week that it would close its @entity4 line after its sale to @entity18 fell through			1
at the end of " @entity20 " in @entity14 , @entity1 , sits the huge plant where -- as the ads touted -- " a different kind of car company " produced a " different kind of car			1
" the first @entity4 , a red @entity27 , rolled off the line in 1990 and it 's still on display at the factory			1
the factory , along with the town , have played a major role in the company 's image and advertisements , even hosting tours and " reunions " for @entity4 car owners			1
at @entity41 , the walls are decorated with old photos of the small town @entity14 was before @entity4 came to town and what it 's grown into			1
" i think people are very proud an @entity49 - made car was made here , " area resident @entity46 said			0
mayor @entity51 credits most of the town 's growth to the @entity4 plant			1
" @entity15 , back in the mid 80 's , is the reason this town began to grow in the first place , " he said			1
eventually , @entity15 decided to move production elsewhere			2
the last @entity4 made in @entity1 rolled off the line in 2007			1
after retooling , @entity15 started building the @entity60 in @entity14 , but that production is now on its way out too			1
in november , it will be moved to a plant in @entity64 , leaving @entity14 's plant idle			1
the move to shut down @entity4 has left some in town disappointed and perplexed			2
" it 's been a great car , " remarked @entity69 who runs an auto repair shop a few miles from the factory			0
@entity69 said he hoped @entity18 would have been able to keep the brand viable			2
" he has a track record that wo n't quit of being a great business man and a good leader			0
i do n't know what happened , " @entity69 said			0
@entity46 said she was also stunned about the end of @entity4			2
" i 'm like everyone else , ' how can this happen ? ' @entity15 has been a forerunner in the automobile industry , and it 's just a really sad indictment on what is happening , " she said			2
" we are kind of curious as to why the decisions have been made that have been made , " @entity51 said			0
" i do know that what @entity15 is trying to do now as a company -- as far as how they are trying to operate and what they are saying the improvements they need to make -- almost mirror what @entity4 was 20 years ago			1
" resident @entity96 puts the blame squarely on the federal government			0
" it 's an abomination what the government is doing to the automotive industry ... get it out of the government 's hands			0
they do n't know how to do cars			0
they can hardly do the government			0
" as for the future of @entity14 , @entity51 is optimistic			2
" i have to believe the plant is going to come back			0
it all depends on the overall economy , " he said			0
" i hope that @entity49 start buying @entity49 products and start supporting the @entity49 auto manufacturing industry and if that happens , we 'll get a product in this plant			0
" @entity51 said he has been working with @entity15 on a daily basis , and has invited president @entity122 and the auto recovery czar to come and tour the plant			2
" i do n't think they understand what this plant is capable of doing and once they see that , i think that they will be well aware of the situation , and i think they could probably give us some help , " he said			0
at 94 , @entity136 has lived in @entity14 most of his life and remembers stories of his grandfather collecting the mail in the area during the @entity142			0
with @entity4 gone and the local plant preparing to idle , @entity136 said , " of course , it 's going to hurt , but it 's not going to kill @entity14			1
