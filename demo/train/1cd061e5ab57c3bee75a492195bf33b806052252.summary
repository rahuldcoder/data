@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 -- @entity4 has been an elementary school teacher in this remote rural village for 39 years but he does n't teach his mother tongue , even though it 's used by almost three million people			1
his job is to get the village , home to members of the @entity13 ethnic group , chattering in @entity14 , also known as @entity14 -- @entity2 's national language -- although he can switch into the local language -- @entity17 -- in the early years to bridge any gaps			1
" when they start learning to write , they start learning the @entity24 language , " he says , referring to @entity2 's largest ethnic group , which makes up 90 % of the population and is politically and culturally dominant			1
teacher @entity4 thinks it 's important they master @entity14 , which will enable them to seek work beyond the confines of their isolated village , but fears his language is disappearing			1
" if we do n't have our own language , there are many things , many stories from the past that we wo n't have and that will be a big loss			2
" the threat is not just the result of an education system that prioritizes the official national language			1
as @entity2 's economy has boomed in recent years , many have left their villages to work in coastal factory towns and returned more at ease conversing in @entity14 than their native tongue			1
some slip into @entity2 for even the closest family relationships , calling their mother and father mama and baba			1
" before we 'd never use these words , " he says			0
" in our @entity13 language it 's bu ( father ) and nei ( mother )			2
" @entity2 is home to 55 ethnic minorities , but only two -- tibetans and @entity64 in @entity2 's far @entity65 -- get much international attention , usually because of discord with their @entity24 rulers and neighbors			1
the others are dotted around the country , with most , like the @entity13 , clustered in the poorer mountainous regions of southwest @entity2			1
ostensibly , there is little overt friction with the @entity2 majority although @entity4 says when he was younger , he was afraid if @entity24 people came to the village			1
as minorities , they are not subject to the strictures of @entity2 's one - child policy but carving out a distinct cultural identity is difficult			1
@entity2 is happy to have the appearance of ethnic diversity , but the wider trend is of gradual assimilation , says june @entity87 , a professor at the @entity88			1
" it 's a wrecking of their culture under the guise of preserving it , " she says			1
" people complain that their folk tales are rewritten to fit @entity97 ideals			0
" the @entity13 's cultural heritage is also weakening as a younger generation adapts to more modern ways			0
the ethnic group has a strong musical tradition and when teacher @entity4 was a teenager , songs were used for courtship			2
accompanied by a gang of friends , he stood outside the house of his now wife and declared his love for her in song			0
" the girl keeps the door shut and you have to keep singing until they open it and let you in , " he says , before plucking a stringed instrument off the wall of his living room to demonstrate he still has the knack			0
however , things have changed since his youth			0
@entity123 , a 25 - year - old factory worker back in the village for the birth of his son , laughs when asked if this was how he met his wife			0
" our grandparents did this , we do not , " he says			0
teacher @entity4 hopes that tourism may reinvigorate the @entity13 's unique culture and encourage younger people like @entity4 to stay closer to home and engage in traditional pursuits			1
the village , a picturesque cluster of timber houses surrounded by bamboo groves , has been designated a heritage site and earmarked for tourism development			2
" the tourists will come here to see our people 's traditions and culture			2
if more people come then maybe the preservation of our traditions will be stronger , " says teacher @entity4			0
elsewhere though , tourism has proved , at best , to be a mixed blessing			1
in villages already on the tourist trail , minority culture is a commodity to sell to passing crowds			1
" some villages become human zoos , " says @entity157			1
" some are happy about what they get out of it but others resent it			0
" this spectacle is on display in nearby @entity167 , home to the @entity170 ethnic group , where villagers perform a live show every afternoon in a specially created outdoor amphitheater			2
it 's standing room only and the audience laps it up			0
but , with girls performing in mini skirts and skits lampooning the group 's predilection for drinking potent rice wine , it makes some older residents shudder			0
" these performances are n't real @entity170 culture , " says @entity185 , the village chief			2
" people just want the entertainment factor			0
" the hope is @entity0 will escape the rampant commercialization that has engulfed some minority villages -- its development is being overseen by the provincial bureau of cultural heritage with help from a @entity198 ngo , the @entity197			2
both organizations want to preserve the village 's cultural dna and hope it can become a @entity203 world heritage site			0
still , the lives of teacher @entity4 's three children , who all work outside their village , demonstrate that the chances of a cultural revival for the @entity13 are slim			0
in their 20s and 30s , one is an accountant in @entity213 , a large city in central @entity2			1
the other two are teachers in the same province			0
they only wear traditional clothes when they come home			0
@entity4 has no grandchildren yet but is sanguine about the chances of his descendants speaking his native tongue			0
" if they are always living outside the village , then they will definitely speak @entity14 , " he says .			2

@entity2 has 55 official minorities but preserving language and culture is difficult
education system prioritizes national language @entity14
@entity2 likes appearance of ethnic diversity , but wider trend is of gradual assimilation
tourism a mixed blessing ; some villages like " human zoos "
