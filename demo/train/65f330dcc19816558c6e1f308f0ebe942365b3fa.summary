@entity0 , @entity1 -- music fans who buy concert tickets during @entity6 's " @entity5 " may be surprised when they check their receipt and see some service fees were charged			1
concertgoers expecting service - free tickets during a @entity6 promotion may still find fees			1
@entity6 's announcement for the promotion -- and stories based on their news release -- did not mention the concert promoter 's narrow definition of a " service fee			1
" " fans will still be asked to pay parking fees ( usually $ 6 ) as well as in some cases facility fees and / or charity fees , " @entity6 spokesman @entity20 wrote in a reply to @entity2 's request for clarification			1
still , the promotion will save consumers several dollars on amphitheater lawn seats bought from 12:01 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. wednesday			1
@entity20 did not respond to @entity2 's question about why the promotion was called " @entity5 wednesday " if there were still fees added to the base cost of each ticket -- or why it was not disclosed in the announcement			1
service fees tacked on to ticket purchases -- averaging a third of the base price -- have long been a source of grumbling from concertgoers			1
" people get a little ticked off when they think they 're paying $ 20 for a ticket and as they progress along the various pages of the electronic transaction they see more fees added along the way , " said @entity44 , who writes about live music tours for @entity46			1
when buying tickets online using a credit card , the buyer does not see the total charged -- with the added fees -- until after they 've submitted the order			2
@entity6 discloses this in its " terms and conditions " statement : " @entity63 may assess a convenience charge on each ticket purchased and / or ordered for certain events			2
" the parking fee , which does not actually pay for a parking space , is on each ticket -- even if the fan does n't drive to the show			2
" we have always charged it this way to alleviate traffic issues that occur when the fee is taken at the lot entrance , " @entity20 said			0
a facility fee is " charged at some venues and goes to defray the cost of venue maintenance , " he said			2
@entity20 did not respond to @entity2 's request for a detailed list of service fees that will be waived during " @entity5 wednesday			1
" @entity6 only began selling tickets to its own concerts last year , just months before announcing plans to merge with @entity89 -- the world 's largest ticket - seller			0
before that , @entity6 promoted shows but had no infrastructure to sell tickets , and it contracted out to @entity89 or others to sell them			0
the @entity98 merger plan has drawn criticism			0
the @entity100 launched an investigation of the proposed merger in february			0
neither @entity6 nor @entity89 executives would respond to questions about the merger			0
however , @entity89 ceo @entity105 did talk about it before a @entity108 subcommittee earlier this year			0
" [ the merger ] will give us greater flexibility in how we promote , market and sell tickets to events			0
it will give us a pathway to alternative pricing and fee structures			0
and we will be better able to develop new and innovative products and services that enhance the fan experience and make all forms of entertainment more accessible to everyone			0
