-- inside a dilapidated warehouse , underneath scattered clothes hanging from rusty pipes , a young black man is down on his knees			0
his feet are naked , his trousers rolled up to his knees as he beats his sodden shirt against the ground to remove the dirt from it			0
near him , a cluster of men cut desolate figures -- some of them crouching down to wash their worn - out clothes , some standing , naked , trying to clean up their work - wasted bodies			0
this is not a scene from prison life -- but it might as well have been			2
instead , this is a communal shower room for mineworkers in @entity26 under apartheid as captured by pioneering photographer @entity28 some five decades ago			1
a tiny man -- barely five feet tall -- with a great eye for detail , @entity28 was one of @entity26 's first black photojournalists			1
his captivating and often clandestine images documented different aspects of black life under apartheid , opening a window into the oppression and economic inequality endured by his people during that brutal era , including mineworkers forced to live in squalid conditions			1
in 1967 , one year after leaving @entity26 to go into exile , @entity28 published his first and only photo book , entitled " @entity46			1
" the book , which was banned in @entity26 , quickly sold out and received great critical acclaim			1
but despite the initial success , @entity28 died destitute and lonely in @entity50 in 1990 and until recently his story was largely unknown			1
yet in recent years , @entity28 's work has received renewed recognition , with several exhibitions in @entity26 and abroad			1
and now , @entity56 's @entity55 is the latest institution to commemorate his ground - breaking work by hosting the first solo touring museum exhibition of 120 rare black - and - white gelatin silver prints from @entity28 's archive at the @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63			1
" @entity28 's life and work were dominated by the apartheid system , " says @entity64 , curator of the exhibition that runs until december 6			1
" it was the theme of his most important photographic work , it was the reason for his going into exile and becoming a stateless , but recognized , stranger in the world , " she continues			0
" the story of @entity28 is very little known and this exhibition is an attempt to shed light on his life and work , and to make part of a large collection of his photographs available to a broad international audience , not the least in @entity28 's native country			1
" dangerous mission the son of a tailor and a laundry woman , @entity28 was born in @entity88 , a black freehold township near @entity89 , in 1940			2
the fourth of six children , he grew up living in the countryside with an aunt because his parents wanted to protect him from crime in urban townships			0
@entity28 reunited with his parents as a teenager and it was then that his interest in photography began			0
aged 15 , @entity28 received his first camera from a family friend , and from then on he would carry it everywhere , always taking pictures of friends , relatives and people in his community			0
in 1958 , @entity28 started working as a darkroom and layout assistant at @entity112 , a radical black lifestyle publication in @entity114			2
he also enrolled in a correspondence photography course from the @entity116 before leaving @entity112 in 1960 to work as a chief photographer on a weekly @entity26 newspaper and as a freelancer for the international press			2
during that period , @entity28 came across the photo essays of @entity123 , the celebrated @entity124 photographer			2
inspired by @entity123 's style , especially his refusal to crop his images , @entity28 set out on a dangerous mission to capture the injustice of the apartheid system and communicate it to the people outside @entity26			1
" he had an intention to make stories that would enlighten the world about what was happening in @entity26 , " says @entity64			0
" his mission was to get change through his pictures			0
" powerful photographs to achieve his goal , @entity28 would often use covert tactics such as working without flash and sneaking his camera inside lunch bags whenever he visited mines or prisons			0
pretending that he was an orphan , he even managed to convince authorities to reclassify him as colored ( mixed race ) , a deception that gave him more freedom to travel in areas where black people were required to carry a permit			0
subtle yet incendiary , @entity28 's powerful photographs offer a stark insight of what it meant to be black under apartheid -- there are pictures of townships being bulldozed to make way for white settlements ; of benches marked " @entity166 only ; " of crammed commuter trains ; of handcuffed black men arrested for being in white areas without a pass ; of downtrodden mineworkers enduring humiliating examinations and dehumanizing living conditions			1
other , happier , photographs include those of children playing with water cannons , friends sharing laughs and couples dancing			0
" he was living with his people , " says @entity64			0
" he was documenting their struggles , their joys and everything , so he really knew what was going on around him			0
" in 1966 @entity28 was arrested with a group of street gangsters with whom he 'd built a relationship so he could capture their lives			0
the police told him he 'd need to become an informant to avoid jail time , so @entity28 decided to flee @entity26 , taking little more than the layouts for his book with him			1
but life in exile -- first in @entity166 and then in the @entity198 -- was painful for @entity28			2
penniless and lonely , he spent much of the remainder of his life living on the streets and subways of @entity50			2
he died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 49 in february 1990 , one week after the release of @entity207 from prison			1
