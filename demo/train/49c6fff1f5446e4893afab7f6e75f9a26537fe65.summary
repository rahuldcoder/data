@entity0 -- a congressional investigation has exposed gaping holes in security eight years after the september 11 terrorist attacks , a government report says			0
an investigator used fake documents to obtain a @entity11 passport , a congressional report says			1
an investigator used a false identification to obtain a @entity11 passport and then used the passport to get an airline boarding pass and go through an airport security checkpoint , according to the @entity17			1
the @entity17 , the investigative arm of @entity18 , said its undercover investigator conducted four tests of the passport issuance system and " easily " obtained passports every time			1
individuals with " even minimal counterfeiting capabilities " can obtain genuine @entity11 passports , which can be used to travel overseas , open bank accounts and prove @entity11 citizenship , the @entity17 report says			1
in the " most egregious " case , it says , the investigator used the @entity33 number of a man who died in 1965 to obtain a social security card			1
in another case , he used the @entity33 number of a 5 - year - old child and obtained a passport , even though his counterfeit documents and application indicated he was 53 years old			2
" a @entity11 passport is a key to virtually anywhere in the world , " said sen. @entity42 , @entity43			0
" it is very troubling that in the years since the september 11 attacks someone could use fraudulent documents to obtain a @entity11 passport			2
" @entity42 and sen. @entity52 , @entity53 , both members of the @entity56 's subcommittee on terrorism , requested the test			0
to perform the test , the @entity17 designed four scenarios			0
in each , an investigator simulated the actions of a malicious person involved in identity theft , then created fake documents using " off - the - shelf , commercially available hardware , software , and materials			1
" the investigator used the counterfeit documents to obtain a genuine @entity0 , identification card			1
for three of the tests , the undercover investigator submitted passport applications and supporting materials at @entity75 locations that accept passport applications			0
for the remaining test , it submitted the application and materials to the @entity82 's regional passport office in @entity0			2
" @entity82 and @entity75 employees did not identify our documents as counterfeit in any of our four tests , " the @entity17 report says			1
the @entity82 " issued a genuine @entity11 passport in each case			2
" " all four passports were issued to the same @entity17 investigator , under four different names , " it says			2
the tests occurred between july and december of last year			0
a @entity82 spokesman was not immediately available for comment			0
but the @entity17 said in the report that @entity82 officials " agreed that our findings expose a major vulnerability " in the passport issuance process			1
@entity82 officials said the department 's ability to verify the information submitted " is hampered by limitations to its information - sharing and data access with other agencies at the federal and state levels			0
" some agencies wo n't share information because of privacy concerns , or because the @entity82 is not a law enforcement agency			0
also , the department , like other government agencies , has difficulty verifying birth certificates because there are thousands of acceptable formats for them .			0
