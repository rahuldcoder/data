@entity10 works away from the spotlight			2
he does nothing for glory			2
he does everything to stop death			0
his story has come to attention through @entity41 , a journalist with @entity42 , who wanted to document the critical work of @entity19 's secret hospitals			1
" since late april , i have been photographing and filming inside the besieged city of @entity3 , " @entity41 says			1

occasionally , someone says : @entity73			0
the field hospital serves a population of about 40,000 people , @entity41 says			1
the daily log books are brimming with names			0
it 's the only place for people in the area to seek help -- not just for war wounds but for simple everyday medical stuff like back pain and blood pressure			1
occasionally the staff sees joy when they help deliver a baby			0
it 's the only working hospital around since the local state hospital has been taken over by the @entity19 army			1
the soldiers turned the place of healing into one of killing , @entity10 says			0
they used it as a military base from which to attack the city			0
snipers take aim from the hospital 's rooftops			1
they have a perfect view from up high			0

you see this child ? they are a terrorist ? @entity41 's camera captures a slice of @entity19 's horror			1
efforts to gain peace dimmed this week with opposition reports of another massacre and intensified government bombardment of several cities and towns			0
despite the chilling images sent in by journalists and opposition activists , @entity41 says @entity19 like dr. @entity10 believe the world has turned away			1
" the world is a very complacent place right now , " @entity41 says			1
" the lack of curiosity , concern , for their fellow humans is appalling			0
there 's only one trained surgeon in the entire field hospital			2
he relies on his colleagues to learn fast on the job			0
smugglers risk their lives to bring in medical supplies and surgical equipment , @entity41 says			1
but that might get harder -- @entity3 has been under seven long months of siege and one of the main supply routes from neighboring @entity191 is cut off			1
despite the dwindling odds , @entity41 is convinced dr. @entity10 and his staff say they will go on performing medical miracles			1

but dr. @entity10 is determined to stick to one of history 's oldest binding documents .			0
