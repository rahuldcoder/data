a lawyer representing the 16 - year - old @entity2 boy who killed four people and critically injured two others while driving drunk lashed out thursday at the news media for their focus on the use of " affluenza " to describe the boy 's privileged upbringing			1
of the two experts who testified in defense of @entity15 , only one used the word and he used it just once , attorney @entity12 told @entity18 's " @entity17			1
" " that term was not used by either of the lawyers that represented mr. @entity15 , and it was not our defense , simply put			1
" he added , " i think it is ridiculous for anyone who knows anything about the criminal justice system or the juvenile justice system to think that we walked into court and said , ' hey , judge , this is a rich , white kid , ' and she went , ' oh , ok , probation			1
' " asked whether he had ever heard of a poor child getting probation -- and no jail time -- after having killed four people , @entity12 acknowledged that he had not			1
but , he said , the goal of the juvenile justice system is to rehabilitate more than to punish			1
" i would submit to you that kids who do things by accident or mistake probably should not be locked up with the key thrown away , " he said			0
@entity49 , whose wife and daughter were killed in the crash , said he thinks the media criticism over the term caused the defense team to want the term to go away			1
" i was actually surprised to hear them attempt to walk back the ' affluenza ' term			2
the outcry follows it , " he told " @entity64 "			0
" and now they wish that indeed that the negative focus was n't so much around ' affluenza			2
' " doctor coins term psychologist @entity69 testified in december that " affluenza " describes a condition caused when a child of privileged background suffers no consequences for repeated bad behavior			2
but it is not recognized as a medical condition in any formal sense and @entity69 acknowledged to @entity64 in december , " we used to call these people ' spoiled brats			0
' " the prosecutor had asked that @entity15 be sentenced to 20 years behind bars			1
instead , state district judge @entity84 ordered in december that he be placed on probation for 10 years			0
in a proceeding wednesday closed to the news media , she specified the terms of that probation : she ordered that @entity15 undergo rehabilitation -- at his family 's expense -- at a locked treatment facility in @entity2 that has not been identified publicly , @entity12 said			1
no minimum time was ordered , though the boy 's driver 's license was suspended and he was ordered to stay away from drugs and alcohol for the duration of his sentence probation			2
after the proceeding , @entity12 was vehement in his attack on the news media			1
" if this case has not taught me anything else , it has confirmed what i was pretty sure of all along -- which is that the media circus is poison to the criminal justice system , " @entity12 told reporters on wednesday , adding that the news coverage had affected decisions by treatment facilities about whether to accept @entity15 for treatment			1
" the story that was reported has so twisted the facts that were actually presented in court that i do n't think the truth will ever be able to come out now , " he said			2
asked what the public was missing from the news reports , he said , " i 'm not going to go into detail with you , but i will tell you that if you had been in the courtroom and you had heard all the testimony , you would have heard a significantly different story than what was reported			0
" @entity12 's attack on the media 's focus on " affluenza " was rich , the prosecutor said			1
" really ? " asked @entity135 , when told of the defense lawyer 's remarks			2
" well , that 's ironic , because it 's his expert that brought that before the courtroom , so somebody made a decision before this hearing that that was a good term			1
" he 's a good attorney , his witnesses do n't say things by accident			1
so they thought maybe that would help			0
and it blew up on them			0
it was a stupid thing to say , it affected the credibility of that expert and it will follow that expert wherever he testifies			0
it was a dumb idea and his testimony was n't credible			0
" looking for an apology @entity15 's avoidance of jail time underscores the need for legislative changes , @entity135 told reporters wednesday			1
" there are some problems with the way juvenile justice is done , " he said			0
" we 're going to ask for the right to a jury trial , we 're going to hope to get legislation to do that , let a jury of his peers determine what the punishment should be			0
" @entity49 said he only wanted to hear @entity15 say he was sorry			2
" we certainly have not seen any remorse , " he said thursday , adding that based on @entity15 's demeanor in the courtroom , he did n't think the teenager understands what he has done			1
last june , his wife , @entity186 , and daughter , @entity188 , left their home to help @entity191 , whose suv had broken down			2
@entity193 , a youth pastor , was driving past and also stopped to help			0
all four were killed when the @entity15 's pickup truck plowed into the pedestrians on a road in @entity198 , south of @entity199			1
@entity15 's vehicle also struck a parked car , which then slid into another vehicle headed in the opposite direction			1
two people riding in the bed of the pickup were injured			0
one is no longer able to move or talk because of a brain injury , while the other suffered internal injuries and broken bones			0
according to prosecutors , three hours after the crash , tests showed @entity15 had a blood alcohol content of 0.24 , three times the legal limit			2
lawyer : @entity15 does feel remorse despite his client 's avoidance of jail time , @entity12 said he did n't feel @entity15 won			1
" there is no winner in this case , " he said			0
" @entity15 is going to live with what he did for the rest of his life , and i can tell you that he certainly feels remorse			2
" he said his client is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder following the accident , that he is " emotionally and socially arrested to where he is effectively like a 12 - year - old , " and that he is " basically shell - shocked " by the process			0
" he has a very flat affect , he is able to express remorse but , quite frankly , i do n't think there is anything he was going to say to anyone that was going to make them feel any better , especially coming from him			0
" @entity242 , whose daughter @entity243 was among the victims , said @entity15 may have gotten off easy , but he 's not done yet			1
" even though he knows how to beat this game , and even if he follows all the little things and jumps through the hoops and does the tricks he 's supposed to do , i do n't think the world is ever going to take their eyes off of him -- no matter where is is , no matter where he goes , no matter what game he or his family think they 've beaten			2
" she said she hopes his rehabilitation efforts succeed , but added , " i think it 's shutting the barn door after the horse is already out			0
" @entity49 said that while he took some solace in the fact @entity15 was n't allowed to go to some expensive treatment facility with horse riding , yoga and other activities , he still will get to return to his nice life after he finishes his treatment			1
" i had a warm , vibrant home that i went to every night			0
i now go home to a quiet , stark , sterile environment , " he told @entity64			0
" so it 's now not a ... it 's just a house			0
it 's not a home			0

man who lost wife , daughter says he does n't think @entity15 is remorseful
" @entity283 " not used by either of the lawyers , says defense attorney @entity12
the media circus is poison to the criminal justice system , " @entity12 says
" well , that 's ironic , " prosecutor says , noting that a defense witness used the term
