@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 on wednesday warned that he could call for early elections , following a string of political crises since the @entity8 withdrawal in the war - torn @entity10 nation			1
" when the other side refuses to sit at the table of dialogue and insists on the policy of provoking successive crises in a way that causes severe damages to the supreme interests of @entity3 people , the prime minister found himself obliged to call for early elections , " the statement said			1
the next parliamentary elections are not scheduled until 2014 , but @entity2 's critics are threatening a no - confidence vote against the @entity27 prime minister			1
it is not clear if there is enough support for the vote to be held			2
following the december @entity8 troop withdrawal , the country has been confronted with an increasingly fractious legislature , which includes @entity3 's @entity27 , @entity36 and @entity37 political blocs			1
the @entity3 @entity38 allows for a prime minister to formally ask the president to dissolve parliament , which -- if approved -- would set in motion a process that could prompt early elections within 60 days			2
@entity2 in recent months has struggled to forge a lasting power - sharing deal , and has yet to fill key @entity46 positions , including the ministers of defense , interior , and national security , while his backers have also shown signs of wobbling support			1
on sunday , the powerful @entity27 cleric @entity56 -- whose political bloc last year won 39 parliamentary seats and has backed the prime minister -- called for more political reforms , saying he would support a no - confidence vote should @entity2 fail to usher in effective change			1
on wednesday , @entity3 's deputy parliament speaker , @entity62 , met with @entity63 , acting political counselor at the @entity65 in @entity0 , to discuss the crisis , according to the parliament website			1
the meeting is considered a sign of the seriousness of the burgeoning problems within the already fragile coalition			0
" we will not comment on specific diplomatic exchanges , " said @entity74 spokesman @entity73 when asked about reports of a meeting			0
" however , we continue to encourage senior @entity3 politicians to work toward a solution that represents the interests of all @entity3			0
" @entity73 said @entity8 officials " urge @entity3 leaders to move quickly to alleviate current tensions in order to refocus energy on critical state - building challenges			1
" last year , the @entity36 - majority @entity89 bloc temporarily suspended its participation in parliament over claims that it was apparently being cut out of the political process			1
soon after , an arrest warrant was issued for vice president @entity95 , the leader of the @entity89 bloc , accusing him of running a death squad			0
his party has since ended its boycott , though @entity95 remains a fugitive in @entity101 and is still wanted by @entity3 's central government			2
@entity103 has denied the charges , calling them politically motivated			0
meanwhile , relations between the @entity107 regional government and the central government have also deteriorated			0
@entity109 , president of the @entity110 , in march blasted the government , calling the power - sharing deal between the various political groups " completely nonexistent " and saying it has " become meaningless			2
" " the @entity3 constitution is constantly violated and the @entity119 agreement , which was the basis upon which the current government was formed , has been completely ignored , " @entity109 said in a statement on the eve of @entity116			0
" as soon as they came to power , they disregarded the @entity38 , the previous agreements that we had , and the principle of power - sharing			0
" the unfolding crisis also comes amid a string of deadly attacks across the country , including a pair of bomb blasts that rocked the capital and killed at least eight people on wednesday			2
a series of attacks in june has left nearly 180 people dead , including one bombing that led to the country 's deadliest day since the @entity8 withdrawal			1
on june 13 , a bomb targeted pilgrims headed to @entity0 , killing at least 93 people			0
an additional 312 people were injured in the attacks , mostly aimed at @entity27 pilgrims who had trekked to a shrine in the @entity3 capital .			0
