-- on monday , a 5 - 4 majority of the @entity3 @entity2 approved strip searches of everyone entering jail after arrest for even the most minor offense			1
the ruling exposed a disturbing insensitivity			0
the plaintiffs in the case , @entity11 , were arrested for relatively minor offenses , such as walking a dog without a leash			1
their lawsuit challenged a policy in two @entity20 detention facilities where all arrested people are strip - searched before joining the inside population			1
in one facility , this means " a complete disrobing , followed by an examination of the nude inmate ... by the supervising officer , which is then followed by a supervised shower with a delousing agent			0
" in the other facility , the booking process " required groups of 30 to 40 arrestees to enter a large shower room , simultaneously remove all of their clothing , place it in boxes and then shower			0
" if you have ever driven over the speed limit in @entity20 , it could be you in that shower			0
the @entity2 quite recently accepted the idea that the @entity46 requires a greater justification for strip searches than for less - intrusive searches			1
in @entity51 v. @entity52 , decided in 2009 , the court said that searches exposing the breasts and pelvic area were " categorically distinct , requiring distinct elements of justification			2
" people in jails and prisons , however , have long enjoyed less privacy than free people			0
in @entity62 v. @entity63 , the @entity2 upheld a policy that subjected all detainees to visual body cavity searches after they had visitors			2
it emphasized that detention facilities had a special need for heightened security that weighs heavily against inmates ' privacy			2
for similar reasons , the court in @entity74 ruled in favor of strip searches			1
no one would deny that @entity3 prisons and jails are dangerous places filled with weapons , drugs and other contraband			0
achieving security in such institutions is crucial			0
but that does not mean strip searches are either a necessary or an effective means of doing so			1
the @entity2 has an obligation to protect the privacy of inmates by scrutinizing law enforcement policies that concern people who have not even gone to trial for their alleged misdemeanors			1
the court 's failure to do so is an abdication of its responsibilities			0
prison and jail officials have exceedingly difficult jobs and are entitled to flexibility in their efforts to secure the institutions they run			0
strip searches , however , are extremely intrusive , humiliating and frequently traumatic , as the @entity2 has acknowledged			1
even in the @entity2 building itself , where the need for security is undoubtedly great , guards do not strip search members of the public who come to watch oral arguments			1
imagine the fallout if they did			0
the plaintiffs in @entity74 , it is worth remembering , are not very different from the crowds that gather outside the @entity2 to hear oral arguments			2
they were not charged with or even suspected of drug - dealing , assault or other violent conduct			0
they are people who sometimes drive over the speed limit , who walk their dogs without a leash now and then and who might miss a child support payment on occasion			0
no one should have to undergo a strip search simply because she had the misfortune of being arrested and taken to jail for what almost everyone has done at one time or another			1
to rubber - stamp subjecting them to strip searches without any demonstrable need , without an iota of reasonable suspicion and without any evidence that such policies are effective is to perpetrate an injustice unworthy of our high court			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			2

@entity153 : @entity2 ruling on strip search was disturbingly insensitive
she says ruling lets authorities strip search those arrested for even minor offenses
she says court must protect inmates ' privacy by scrutinizing law enforcement procedures
@entity153 : a rubber - stamp on strip searches without reasonable suspicion is *unjust*
