@entity0 -- airport security policies " have to evolve " to ensure the safety of passengers while minimizing invasive procedures such as enhanced pat downs , @entity3 press secretary @entity2 said monday			1
@entity2 stopped short of signaling any imminent change in the enhanced screening , which some passengers complain amounts to legal groping			1
however , @entity2 made clear that the government is open to adjusting the procedures in response to public feedback and intelligence gathered on possible plots			0
" this is a process that , based on intelligence and based on feedback , is and will continue to evolve and change			0
" @entity2 told reporters , adding the goal is to " maximize the security and protection and minimize that invasiveness			2
" he noted that airport screening has evolved in recent years to include the banning of most liquids , removing shoes and other steps in response to specific threats , and added : " the policies have to evolve			0
" travelers who set off metal detectors at airport security are asked to undergo extra screening			1
if they refuse to go through an enhanced visual device that shows the body through clothing , they are required to submit to the thorough pat down in order to fly			1
incidents such as last december 's failed bombing of a @entity46 - bound flight by a man with explosives in his underwear and the recent detection of explosives in air cargo packages from @entity53 prompted the enhanced screening			2
however , the more thorough pat - down process has generated alarm and anger , with some travelers complaining they were given little warning of the procedure and that they felt violated by the touching of private parts			1
in interviews and statements sunday and monday , the head of the @entity64 said the enhanced screening was necessary for now , but the policies could be revised as time goes on			1
" we welcome feedback and comments on the screening procedures from the traveling public , and we will work to make them as minimally invasive as possible while still providing the security that the @entity46 people want and deserve , " @entity64 administrator @entity69 said in a statement released sunday			1
" we are constantly evaluating and adapting our security measures , and as we have said from the beginning , we are seeking to strike the right balance between privacy and security			2
" @entity69 also told @entity1 that the outcry over the new screening was overblown			0
" very few people actually receive the pat down			2
in spite of all the public furor about this , very few people do , " he said			0
on friday , @entity69 issued a public service video announcement offering travelers guidance on what to expect from @entity64 security officials ahead of the holiday travel season			1
" as you enter the checkpoint , you 'll be directed to go through either a walk - through metal detector , or in some airports , an @entity102 -- @entity102 -- unit , " he said in the video			0
" if you are directed to pass through an @entity102 , you may opt out			0
if you choose to opt out you will receive a thorough pat down by someone of the same gender , " he said			0
" we very much appreciate your involvement , cooperation and assistance in assuring the safety of you , the traveling public			0
