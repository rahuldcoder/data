@entity0 , @entity1 -- you might think green eggs are only found in a dr. @entity6 classic			0
but at a small , family - run and highly regarded chicken farm on the outskirts of the @entity11 , they 're a relatively common sight			1
" is n't that beautiful ? " said @entity14 owner @entity13 as she held one of the green gems			2

by the time it was extinguished , much of the farm and some 1,200 chicks had perished			1
with the existence of @entity14 at stake , determined friends , neighbors and loyal customers of the @entity61 came to the rescue			1
" it was so inspiring and heartwarming , @entity13 said			0
" it was a wonderful feeling to know that people cared about the farm as much as i did			0
" friend @entity70 organized a fundraising effort of raffles , silent auctions , and dinners			0
she helped raise $ 30,000 to build new coops and replace the chicks killed in the fire			1
" you ca n't hear something like that and just go , ' i 'm sorry			0
i 'm sorry that this thing you have worked so hard for is done and there 's nothing anyone can do about it , ' " @entity81 said			0
through the intrepid determination and loyal commitment of a true community , @entity14 is back on the map .			0
