-- an elderly man stares forlornly at his feet , surrounded by twisted reindeer carcasses , their matted blood stark against a field of endless snow			1
he clutches a knife , and at first glance you 'd be forgiven for thinking he caused the carnage himself			0
instead , the two reindeer locked antlers in battle , and unable to untangle themselves , starved to death over many days			1
@entity16 , the herder in the haunting photo , discovered their entwined bodies and finally cut them apart			0
@entity20 , a 37 - year - old @entity21 photographer living with the mysterious @entity23 tribe , caught the moment forever			1
@entity25 is one of 11 female @entity27 photojournalists whose remarkable images are now on display in a new exhibition in @entity31 , called -- aptly enough -- " @entity32			1
" from @entity25 's dramatic images of @entity36 tribes people , to @entity38 's intimate photographs of @entity40 child brides , and @entity42 's action shots of leopards in the wild , the exhibition delves deep into hidden communities , often in some of the most inhospitable environments on the planet			1
" you must have a certain amount of resilience and courage to be a photographer in general , and perhaps especially to be a photographer for a magazine like @entity27 , " said the show 's curator and senior photo editor , @entity58			1
" we put people into the field for quite long times -- eight weeks would be the average			0
" women 's work ? featuring almost 100 images taken since 2000 , the exhibition is a world away from when first female staff photographer , @entity68 , started working in the 1950s			1
the male chief of the photographic lab at the time had some advice for @entity68 : " if you find the going too tough , why not run over to @entity74 for a weekend and get some new clothes -- i understand that is good for a woman 's morale			0
" it 's enough to make any feminist 's blood boil			0
but as @entity84 explains , " unfortunately , it was really characteristic of the time			0
" indeed , in the 125 - year - history of @entity27 , a magazine which prides itself on intrepid exploration , there have been four female staff photographers , compared to around 50 men			1
" at @entity27 there probably was more of a sense that people needed to be really tough to do some of these stories on the other side of the world			1
and it was much harder for a woman to counter these societal norms and be on her own in a lot of remote areas , " said @entity84			0
" now , seeing all these women working in really difficult conditions -- not just conflict but also in the middle of epidemics , facing wild animals , political repression , severe climates			2
it really shows what women are capable of , it 's a direct answer to the person who said that to @entity68			2
" true grit if ever there was an indication of how far female photojournalists have come in the last century , it 's in the work of @entity25 , who spent four years living on - and - off with traditional reindeer herders , called @entity121			1
the mother - of - one learnt their language and even worked as a housekeeper , or beaga , in an effort to immerse herself in their ancient culture , spread across @entity36 and parts of @entity130			1
living in a tepee - like structure called a laavo , in temperatures plunging to @entity134 , @entity25 says being a woman actually helped her integrate into the family			0
" @entity127 in general has this tradition of having a beaga , which is a woman that would come into the home , help with the children , help with the meals , help with the cleaning , help prepare skin , which i did , " explained @entity25			0
" i do n't think a male photographer would be able to sit around the table and sew with the women , and hear their stories in quite the same way			2
" similarly , fellow photographer @entity38 found her gender gave her unique access to the women 's barracks of @entity40 's elite counter-terrorism unit , capturing a khaki - clad officer patrolling the lurid pink halls			2
meanwhile , @entity159 went on an impromptu swim with three elderly women on @entity21 's @entity162 , using an underwater camera to photograph the sprightly women in the ominous surf			2
for @entity25 , it was the pioneering female photographers of the last 50 years who really paved the way for her today , admitting : " i have n't found the obstacles i believe they have come up against			1
" @entity84 agreed , saying : " today it feels much more 50 - 50 to me in the photojournalism schools			0
it 's becoming much more even , but i think there 's still a residue of all the generations which have come before			0
" the perfect shot following an assignment , it 's up to photo editor @entity84 to sift through over 50,000 images , before publishing the best handful			1
" what i 'm looking for is something that 's both meaningful , that reveals something , and something that 's really striking visually , " she said			0
@entity25 's haunting photograph of @entity16 the reindeer herder made the grade when it was published in 2011			2
but it also summed up the photographer 's fascination with mysterious hunting societies			0
" what i realized from @entity16 in this moment is that we are all part of this cycle of life , " she said .			0

new exhibition of @entity27 female photographers opens
includes @entity20 , lived with @entity36 reindeer herders for four years
women photojournalists must have tenacious spirit to travel world for " perfect shot "
