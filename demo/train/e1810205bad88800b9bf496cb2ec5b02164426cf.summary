-- @entity1 may have been the villain of @entity3 's 2011 - 12 season , but the @entity5 striker is doing his best to make amends in another difficult start to this @entity9 campaign			1
the fallout from @entity1 's eight - match suspension for racially abusing @entity13 's @entity12 ultimately led to @entity3 legend @entity14 losing his job as manager in may			1
his successor @entity17 is under increasing pressure after the club 's worst start to a season in more than a century , but @entity1 's inspirational performance in sunday 's 1 - 1 draw with 10 - man @entity24 helped prevent a fourth defeat in 10 @entity9 games			1
his second - half equalizer -- a superb display of control for his 10th goal this season after chesting down a long pass and rounding the keeper -- lifted the 18 - time @entity35 champions up to 12th in the table			1
the confrontational @entity1 is never far from the headlines , having been accused by several opposition managers of diving and going to ground too easily			0
such was his combative presence on sunday that he lured visiting defender @entity41 -- a fellow @entity42 from neighboring @entity43 -- into a rash challenge that earned a red card			0
while @entity3 could n't capitalize on that advantage , @entity46 was grateful for another virtuoso show from @entity1 -- who also scored in last weekend 's @entity51 derby draw with @entity52 , when he had a late winner wrongly ruled out for offside			1
" i thought he was unplayable			0
@entity41 getting sent off was frustration , " said @entity46 , whose team trailed to @entity58 's strike just before halftime			1
" i do n't think he could get near him today , and he 's a good defender , @entity41			0
" @entity1 is so bright , so clever , he 's a world - class striker			2
on that form today he really frustrates and provokes defenders			0
he has a hunger for the game , he has a hunger for goals			0
" it was , however , @entity3 's fifth draw this season and followed a humiliating 3 - 1 midweek @entity74 defeat at home to @entity46 ' former club @entity76 -- when @entity1 also scored			1
" once we can turn those draws into wins by converting the chances ... but that 's about players , the type of players you need			0
if we can get that over the next couple of ( transfer ) windows it bodes really well for us , " said @entity46 , who was criticized for his lack of top signings in august while allowing @entity88 striker @entity87 to leave for @entity89			0
the result left @entity24 in 10th place , and came at a cost of injuries to midfielder @entity58 , defender @entity99 and top scorer @entity100			2
meanwhile , @entity101 moved off the bottom after a 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity105 in sunday 's other @entity9 game			1
@entity108 striker @entity107 scored a second - half equalizer that will lift some of the pressure on his manager @entity111 , though both teams remained in the bottom three			0
in @entity116 's @entity115 , @entity114 failed to capitalize on @entity118 ' first defeat in 50 matches , being held 1 - 1 at home by @entity121 on sunday despite a sixth - minute goal from @entity5 striker @entity123			1
substitute @entity124 leveled in time added on to leave @entity114 -- beaten by @entity126 in midweek -- in third place , five points behind leaders @entity118			0
@entity130 moved up to fourth after a 4 - 1 win at home to @entity133 , while @entity134 went in the other direction after a 4 - 0 defeat by seventh - placed @entity137			2
in @entity139 , @entity138 moved up to fourth place after beating @entity141 3 - 2 despite having midfielder @entity142 sent off just over a minute after he came on			1
@entity138 went 3 - 1 ahead straight after the substitute 's 65th - minute dismissal and held on against a team that is battling to avoid an immediate return to the second division			1
@entity148 beat @entity149 2 - 1 in sunday 's other @entity151 fixture , with two goals from @entity153 lifting his team to seventh place and above the visitors on goal difference			2
in @entity160 's @entity159 , @entity158 moved up to fifth after a 0 - 0 draw with seventh - placed @entity162 on sunday			0
@entity163 can reclaim that position with a draw at @entity166 on monday			0
@entity167 claimed eighth spot with a 1 - 0 win at bottom club @entity170 while @entity171 won 1 - 0 in a clash with fellow strugglers @entity173			2
@entity174 joined @entity173 and @entity175 on 10 points from 10 games after beating @entity178 1 - 0 , while @entity179 moved above that group to 14th with a 2 - 1 win at @entity182 thanks to two goals from @entity184 .			2

@entity1 's 10th goal this season earns @entity3 a 1 - 1 draw with @entity24
striker *cancels* out @entity58 's opener ; also involved as @entity41 sees red
@entity114 's @entity194 title hopes suffer *setback* after conceding late equalizer against @entity121
