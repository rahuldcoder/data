@entity0 , @entity1 -- thousands of people were pushing for rescue efforts in @entity1 to continue sunday , after a 24 - year - old man was pulled alive from the ruins on saturday , 11 days after the nation 's devastating earthquake			1
the @entity1 government says it will be switching from a search and rescue operation to a search and recovery mission			1
but families of @entity14 who were staying at the leveled @entity15 are fighting that , and started an online petition saturday in an effort to continue search efforts there " until all the survivors are accounted for			1
" as of sunday morning , 2,395 people had signed the petition and sent 6,216 messages to the @entity25 , @entity26 and the @entity27 , said @entity28 , a friend of a family whose relatives are among the missing			0
the families hope to have at least 5,000 signatures by monday , she said			1
the @entity1 government has said more than 111,000 people died in the january 12 quake , which registered 7.0 in magnitude			1
but on saturday , a @entity38 rescue team was able to save one life as they pulled @entity40 from the rubble of the @entity42 in @entity0			1
according to his brother , @entity43 worked in the hotel 's grocery store and survived his week and a half in the rubble by consuming cookies and beer			2
dehydrated but apparently without injury , @entity43 was even talkative as he was placed in an ambulance and driven to a hospital			0
lt. col. @entity54 , a @entity38 rescuer briefly overcome with emotion , called the three - hour effort " a miracle			2
" other members of the team -- assisted by @entity14 and @entity61 workers -- were seen weeping after @entity43 was freed			0
rescues like @entity43 's , and others that have happened in the week following the disaster , sparked hope among families of the missing			2
but the emotional rescue came on a day when much of @entity1 was mourning as operations largely shifted from rescue to recovery , and the country 's president attended the funeral of an archbishop who was one of the victims			1
a @entity79 rescue team had pulled the body of 63 - year - old monsignor @entity81 from ruins near the national cathedral , which he oversaw as archbishop of @entity0			1
at the funeral , president @entity87 was asked to respond to criticism that he has not shown strong public leadership and has been largely unseen in the aftermath			0
" this is not about politics today , " he said			0
@entity94 : looking for loved ones in @entity1 the most recent death toll is the worst caused by an earthquake since the 2004 @entity99 tsunami that resulted from a temblor , and the second - highest death toll from an earthquake in more than three decades , according to the @entity103			1
" rescue teams continue to work in @entity0 , we continue to hope that they will be able to find people still alive , but as time passes , we must gradually shift our resources from rescue to recovery , " @entity104 , spokesman for @entity106 peacekeeping operations , said saturday			1
international search teams have rescued at least 132 people since the quake struck , the @entity106 said			2
@entity104 said the priority now is to remove bodies and clean up affected areas to avoid health hazards and the spread of disease			0
he said the @entity106 will start bringing in heavier equipment , which will allow teams to move concrete and damaged homes			0
more than 600,000 people have also been left homeless in and around the capital of @entity0 , the @entity106 @entity128 said			0
interactive map of where to find aid , hospitals in @entity1 meanwhile , up to 140 flights a day are regularly arriving at the single - runway @entity0 airport , compared with 25 in the immediate aftermath of the january 12 quake , @entity128 said saturday			1
to relieve congestion at the airport , humanitarian cargo is being moved to a forward dispatch area at one end of the runway			0
the @entity145 airport in @entity146 , in neighboring @entity147 , is starting to report congestion as it becomes increasingly used as an alternative airport , @entity128 said			0
it will now be open overnight to accommodate the extra traffic			0
those managing the land transport of supplies from @entity146 will need fuel , and @entity128 said there is enough in @entity1 to last an additional 18 to 19 days			1
but it said it expects no shortage of fuel because supplies of fuel will be able to enter the port during that time			0
one concern with cross-border traffic is the unauthorized departure of @entity1 children , @entity128 said			2
charities and aid groups have said in recent days that they are concerned about the danger of child trafficking after the earthquake			2
groups including @entity170 and @entity171 have called for a halt to adoptions , saying many children may appear to be orphaned but have simply been separated from their families			2
" if children must be evacuated from @entity1 because their protection needs can not be met in country , the evacuation must be carefully documented , the children must be registered with the proper authorities and all efforts must be made to reunify them with family before any adoption proceedings are considered , " the @entity14 - based @entity176 said			1
the number of unaccompanied children needing support is greater than the capacity to respond , @entity128 said			0
authorities are working with unaccompanied children who are being released from hospitals , it said .			0
