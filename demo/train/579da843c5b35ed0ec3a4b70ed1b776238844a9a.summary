-- let 's say that you 're the @entity3			1
but , just for the purpose of this exercise , try to envision yourself as a government agency )			0
you 're about to make a decision that will affect millions of travelers			0
your decision may please them or it may infuriate them			0
most of them have no idea right now that you 're contemplating the decision , but as soon as you make it , all of them will become aware , and they will respond , likely in a visceral manner			0
what do you do ? what the real @entity3 is pondering concerns expanding the permitted use of tablets , personal communication devices and other electronic gadgets on commercial flights			1
last month , @entity30 reported , @entity29 chairman @entity28 wrote in a letter to @entity3 acting administrator @entity32 : " i write to urge the @entity3 to enable greater use of tablets , e-readers , and other portable electronic devices during flight , consistent with public safety ... mobile devices are increasingly interwoven in our daily lives			1
they empower people to stay informed and connected with friends and family , and they enable both large and small businesses to be more productive and efficient , helping drive economic growth and boost @entity49 competitiveness			0
" for many years , passengers have been told that some electronic devices , including cell phones , can interfere with aircraft navigation and communication signals			1
but as technology advances , ways around this are being developed			0
many airlines already sell in - flight @entity61 connections for laptop computers and tablets , so the logical next step would be to allow airborne passengers to use their cell phones to connect to the world below			1
a few thoughts : in terms of written communication from passengers on the plane to people down below -- e-mail , text messages sent from cell phones , social network posts -- the more the better			1
anything the digital traffic will bear			0
if you 've been on flights with @entity61 enabled , you may have noticed that the passengers using it seem to be contented , almost docile -- the tension level seems to have been lowered			2
like it or not , we 've become hooked on being constantly connected , and passengers who are able to maintain that connection while six miles in the air appear to be traveling in a state of something close to silent , electronically - sated , tunnel - vision bliss			2
but there should be one exception to this : technical and connectivity issues aside , the @entity3 and @entity29 should never extend their digital - era permission slip to voice calls on cell phones			1
the result of allowing phone calls in the air would produce the opposite of the tranquilizing effect of permitting other forms of electronic communication			1
the anger level of travelers who become incensed by the yammering in the next seat would rise to the level of a public safety concern			0
passengers would be demanding to be moved , would ask flight attendants to referee disputes , would probably engage in fistfights			2
allowing jousting matches or bullfights in airplane aisles would n't be much more disruptive than allowing voice calls on planes			2
( but what about the idea of passengers voluntarily exercising restraint and courtesy in those close quarters , limiting the length and loudness of their calls out of respect for their fellow citizens ? all right , stop laughing and rolling around on the floor -- get up			1
this is the @entity49 in the 21st century			0
we know that voluntary phone courtesy is not going to happen )			2
you may recall @entity139 , the air - to - ground pay phone service that debuted on commercial flights in the 1980s			2
it required a credit card for each call , and was expensive -- $ 7.50 in ' 80s dollars for the first three minutes , when the service was introduced			0
it never become all that popular , and eventually it faded away			0
but that was before the advent of personal cell phones			0
talking on the phone anywhere , at any time , is today seen not as an exotic and costly luxury but as an entitlement			0
the @entity3 is reportedly not considering voice - call permission on flights ; if and when that day comes , walking across the country may feel like a more palatable option than flying			1
there 's one decision the @entity3 is evaluating that probably says more about us than it does about in - flight safety : those two brief stretches of time when all electronic devices must be turned off -- after the doors to the plane close until it is at cruising altitude , and then again on approach for landing -- are being questioned			1
if it can be determined that signals do not interfere with the pilots ' transmissions , should passengers now be allowed to use their electronic gadgets even in those few minutes ? some contend that , in those crucial parts of a flight , passengers should not be distracted , and should be alert to instructions from the cabin crew			1
but reading a magazine or a book can lure a passenger 's attention from the crew , and those are not prohibited			0
so the question would seem to be : has the addiction to the gadgets become so powerful that we are unwilling to disconnect and look away even for that paltry handful of minutes ? has the agitation from withdrawal gotten to that level ? because if it has , then this is an issue considerably more profound and far - reaching than anything having to do with the rules of travel			1
regardless of what the @entity3 decides , there is one option for in - flight diversion that will still be available , something ancient kings and monarchs could only dream of : looking out the window , high above the clouds			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			2

@entity215 : @entity3 looks at letting passengers use gadgets on *takeoff* , landing
he says the more texting , e-mailing and *surfing* are allowed , the better
cell phone calls are the opposite , though : they raise *anxiety*
@entity215 : are we that unwilling to disconnect from our gadgets for a few minutes ?
