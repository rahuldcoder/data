@entity0 -- the @entity2 made its global sales debut friday , but the lines of fans outside many stores were much smaller than previous @entity7 debuts			1
by midday , the line at @entity7 's flagship store in @entity0 to pick up reserved devices had five people , a far cry from the throngs that turned out for the @entity15 debut here last year			1
@entity0 was among the first of 34 countries -- including the @entity18 and major @entity20 markets -- where the @entity2 went on sale friday			1
local press reports in @entity23 and @entity24 also suggested fewer fans were lining up to greet the thin 7.9 - inch tablet			0
buyers were required to pre-order the device and arrive to pick up at a scheduled time , which may have contributed to the muted response			0
in january @entity7 halted sales of its @entity32 in @entity33 and @entity34 after scuffles broke out among fans waiting overnight to buy the phone			0
@entity7 would n't comment on how many @entity38 were pre-ordered			1
do people really want a smaller @entity15 ? in recent years , lining up to be among the first to buy new @entity7 products has become a ritual around the globe			2
yet news reports and anecdotal posts on @entity45 found smaller - than - usual lines at @entity7 stores in @entity48 , @entity49 and other cities			2
however , more than 750 people lined up to buy the tablet -- or other @entity7 gadgets -- friday morning outside @entity7 's flagship store on @entity55 in @entity56 , according to @entity58 's @entity57			1
the size of the line was perhaps surprising given that @entity61 has disrupted access to @entity63 and some parts of the city are still without power			0
on @entity45 , some observers criticized the priorities of @entity56 lining up to buy a pricey electronic gadget when other city residents were suffering in the aftermath of the storm			0
in @entity0 , the sale brought out the @entity7 faithful such as @entity75 , who added the @entity2 to his collection of products that include the @entity32 , @entity78 and @entity15			1
" i love @entity7 , " @entity75 said			0
" i 'm going to use the @entity2 , and give my @entity15 to my family			2
" those who crowded in the store over the @entity2 display seemed more curious than ready to purchase the tablets , with models starting at $ 329			0
" i have several other tablets , so i 'm just going to wait , " said one customer , who asked not to be named , as he tried out the @entity2			0
@entity2 : ireporters weigh in unlike previous releases , @entity7 is not blazing new territory with its @entity2 tablet			1
instead , it 's getting into a small - tablet market already occupied by competitors such as @entity94 's @entity93 and @entity96 's @entity95			1
the cost of the new @entity2 was a chief complaint among reviewers when the tablet was previewed by the press last week			0
" for $ 200 you can get a nexus 7 , you can get a @entity95 , with similar specs -- so you 're really paying an @entity7 premium here , " @entity102 , senior editor at @entity103 , told @entity1 last week			2
hands - on with the @entity2 " it 's the first kind of defensive play we 've seen from @entity7 in a while , " @entity102 said			1
" this is the first time they 're kind of playing catch up			0
" as @entity117 reports , @entity7 shares fell below $ 600 earlier this week after a management shakeup and mixed @entity2 reviews			2
@entity120 , one of the late @entity122 ' top lieutenants , also was shown the door after some recent missteps , including @entity7 's heavily criticized release of @entity126 -- which led to an apology from @entity7 ceo @entity128			1
@entity1 's @entity129 contributed to this story .			0
