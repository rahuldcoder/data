@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 wednesday announced a reduction in the @entity3 troop level in @entity6 , removing 500 service members by the end of next year			1
in remarks to the @entity10 , @entity2 said the move will bring the troop level to 9,000 , and more reductions will be carried out in the coming years			1
" we are now entering a new phase in which the @entity6 forces will do more of the fighting and patrolling , and our forces more training and mentoring , " @entity2 said			1
" as president @entity21 said in his address last month , the mission is changing from combat to support			2
" @entity2 emphasized the move " marks the start of a process which will ensure that by the end of 2014 there will not be anything like the number of @entity3 troops there as there are now -- and they will not be serving in a combat role			1
" after 2014 , he said , @entity3 will have a " major strategic relationship with @entity6 , " involving development , training , diplomacy and trade			0
" above all , we have a vital national security interest in preventing @entity6 from once again becoming a safe haven for international terrorism			0
so although forces will not long be present in a combat role , we will have a continuing military relationship , " he said			1
the announcement was made on the eve of the sixth anniversary of the july 7 terror attack in @entity0 , and @entity2 makes the point that the attack was " inspired by @entity51 and executed by extremists following the same perverted ideology that underpinned the september 11th attack in 2001			1
" @entity2 noted that international troops have been putting pressure on @entity51 and the @entity58 in @entity59 and @entity6 , pointed out the killing of @entity51 leader @entity61 , and cited the weakening of @entity51			1
he also said there 's evidence to indicate that the @entity58 's " momentum " in @entity66 -- in which @entity3 troops have been based -- has been stopped			0
" in 2009 , my predecessor told this @entity10 that some three - quarters of the most serious terrorist plots against @entity3 had links to @entity6 and @entity59			0
we must always be on our guard , but i am advised that this figure is now significantly reduced , " @entity2 said			1
the planned reduction comes as other countries also make preparations for drawdowns and shift to plans for non-combat missions in @entity6 , such as training			0
@entity81 president @entity21 recently announced the withdrawal of 33,000 @entity81 troops by the end of next year			2
@entity85 announced that it would also begin to reduce troop numbers , saying it " will initiate a progressive withdrawal of troops in @entity6 , and will follow a timetable comparable to the withdrawal of the @entity81 troops			1
" @entity92 this week is ending its combat mission in @entity6 and transitioning to a training role			1
@entity3 's 500 - troop reduction does not include the previously announced plan to withdraw 426 @entity3 military personnel by february			0
along with the military strides , @entity2 said the @entity6 security forces have been making great improvements			2
for example , he cited their handling of the aftermath of the @entity106 hotel attack last week			0
" the @entity6 forces dealt with it professionally and speedily , only calling in assistance from a @entity111 helicopter to deal with insurgents on the roof , " @entity2 said			2
@entity3 has long had the second - largest contingent in @entity111 's @entity115 , the coalition that has been fighting militants in @entity6			0
the @entity81 has the largest			2
the number of @entity3 troops who have died in @entity6 stands at 375			0
the latest was on monday , when @entity120 , from @entity121 , @entity122 , 4th @entity123 , was killed			0
