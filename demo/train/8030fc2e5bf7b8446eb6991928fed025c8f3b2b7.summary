-- can you imagine a world where the sun never sets ? for scientists cruising @entity6 in a mammoth 94 - meter ship , that 's exactly the surreal realm they encountered			1
now their remarkable two - month expedition has been condensed into a haunting time - lapse video , following the floating laboratory as it plowed its way through some of the most brutal conditions on the planet			1
" we arrived in summer , mid-february , when there was 24 - hour sunlight , " @entity17 student , @entity16 , told @entity0			1
" the sun would move from high in the sky to very low , but would never completely disappear			0
i did n't get tired until 1.am -- it was very energizing			0
" ' touching infinity ' @entity26 , who is studying international ocean policy , was one of 30 @entity29 scientists monitoring @entity6 's unique eco-system , as part of a @entity33 research cruise			1
the ship wound its way along the stunning @entity35 -- believed to be the last untouched marine eco-system on the planet -- providing scientists with an important insight into one of our few remaining healthy waterways			1
during the summer months , @entity6 -- the southern most tip of the globe -- is transformed into a bewitching " @entity45 , " where the sun never dips below the horizon , instead continuously moving in circles			1
after more than a week of this extraordinary phenomenon , the team finally saw their first sunset at 1.am -- an experience @entity26 described as " like touching infinity			0
" " brilliant orange light streamed through the portholes on the starboard side of the ship			2
i peeled myself away from my microscope , dashed across the room and peered outside to catch the sun blazing down on the horizon , " the 33 - year - old said			2
" the sight took my breath away -- the sky was on fire , turning the ocean a deep purple red			0
gusts of wind collided with the wide rolling swells , driving an arc of brilliant pink spray 10 feet into the air			0
" life and death despite the breathtaking beauty of this icy underworld , conditions could also be brutal with winds of 110 kilometers per hour and temperatures plunging to -40c			1
on these extreme days , scientists were n't allowed outside on the deck covered in a slippery -- and dangerous -- layer of ice			2
" if you fell overboard you 'd be dead within minutes because the water is below freezing , " said @entity26			0
" yet it 's an environment that 's also teeming with animals such as emperor penguins and @entity94 seals			2
" sometimes tightly packed ice up to 10 ft deep threatened to trap the ship -- @entity26 admitted on previous expeditions it had been stuck for weeks -- and it was forced to spend hours reversing and ramming its way through			2
the adventure was caught on film after @entity26 attached a video camera to the bow of the boat -- capturing everything from blazing sunshine to fierce storms			2
' forget friday night ' for more than two months , the team cruised @entity6 's wild @entity35 -- more than 5,000 kilometers from the closest country ; @entity112			1
their ship , the @entity115 , became a floating island in itself , equipped with a helicopter hanger , gym , industrial kitchen , library , conference room and laboratory			0
@entity26 was part of a team measuring plankton in the water and would usually start her experiments at 7.am , working until 8.pm			0
during the summer months , @entity6 's green plankton bloom grows so large it can be seen from outer space			1
" we were there to test what happens to all that phytoplankton , which provides a vital source of carbon -- or food -- to the system , " @entity26 explained			0
" does it sink out to the bottom ? get eaten over the summer ? does it get transported out of the system ? many think that this large source of phytoplankton is the reason why the @entity35 has such large populations of predators			1
" some people would still be up sampling water until 4.am , " she added			0
" the idea of weekends and normal friday nights completely disappears			0
" spiritual science for @entity26 , the journey was more than just a science expedition -- it was a spiritual experience which gave her a renewed appreciation for mighty mother nature			0
" it just grabbed me in a very visceral way , " said @entity26			0
" it 's such an obviously beautiful place but also surreal -- the conditions are so extreme so you 're seeing a whole other world you 've never seen before			1
" many scientists now believe the @entity35 is the last untouched marine ecosystem in the world			1
if @entity26 ' stunning video is anything to go by , it 's also one worth protecting .			2
