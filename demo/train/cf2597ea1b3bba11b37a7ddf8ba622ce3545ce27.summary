the biggest star of the @entity4 festival is less than a year old , sleeps all day and looks like she just swallowed a hairball			1
the real - life cat , an internet sensation since photos of her sourpuss face began circulating last fall , has been holding court during @entity4 at the @entity15 , a temporary lounge run by the tech - news site			1
people have stood for hours , in lines snaking around the block , to get their picture taken with her			2
@entity7 , an 11 - month - old mixed breed whose real name is @entity7 , has ignored them all			1
mostly she sleeps in a cat bed while fans pass by to pose next to her			1
instead of smiling , many of them make pouty faces of their own			0
through it all , @entity7 has remained unimpressed			1
" people keep asking if we sedate her , " said one of her handlers , @entity33 , on sunday			0
( the answer is no. ) " it 's been crazy			2
yesterday , they were lined up for almost three blocks			2
" this is the first official public appearance for @entity7 , who lives with her owner , @entity7 , in @entity45 , @entity46			1
the cat first gained fame in september when @entity33 , @entity7 's brother , posted some photos of her on @entity50 , the social - news site			1
" it was an accident , " said @entity33 of the viral stardom that followed			2
" we thought it would get some laughs , with the @entity56 liking cats			0
and it just kept going			0

" i do n't mind it , " @entity7 said of her pet 's celebrity			1
" i 'm thrilled to see that my cat brings joy to people			0
" the @entity80 declined to say exactly how much money they 've earned off @entity7 , although @entity33 said it 's in the mid-five figures			1
they 're also sensitive to charges that they 're exploiting their pet			0
at @entity4 , they have made her available to the public only for several hours each day , and @entity7 sits close by to make sure no fans get too cozy			1
but that has n't stemmed people 's enthusiasm for the small cat with the cranky face			2

the result supports the notion that @entity56 fame is becoming as potent a force as other types of celebrity			0
