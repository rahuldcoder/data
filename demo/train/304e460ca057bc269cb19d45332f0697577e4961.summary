-- while the sporting world awaits confirmation of his mega-money new sponsorship deal with @entity5 , @entity1 has deflected attention to one of the other big stories on golf 's horizon this week -- the naming of the next @entity13 captain			1
the world @entity14 was part of last year 's winning team , famously triumphing in his final - day singles match after needing a police escort to get to the @entity22 course on time			1
@entity24 stood down after guiding the @entity25 to a remarkable come - from - behind win over the @entity27 -- and his assistants @entity28 and @entity30 were initially frontrunners for the 2014 role at @entity33 in @entity34			1
however , that changed when the @entity27 turned once again to @entity36 , the last @entity27 captain to triumph on @entity25 soil in 1993 and who won four of his eight major titles at @entity34 links courses			1
since then @entity41 has been widely tipped to repeat his 2010 role , when @entity25 won at @entity43 , and the eight - time @entity45 money list winner confirmed last week that he would be interested in the leading the team in his home country			1
" i thought it was between @entity28 and @entity30 until @entity28 said something , then my name was mentioned , " @entity41 said ahead of the @entity49 event in @entity50 , where he finished 18 shots behind sunday 's victor @entity52			1
" i 've never canvassed , as i did n't last time			0
i 've not spoken to anybody about this			0
but i 've always felt that if i was asked i would do it and that 's still the case			0
" however , @entity1 -- who played under @entity41 -- has firm opinions about who should be captain			1
" @entity13 captaincy should be a 1 - time thing , " the @entity63 said on his @entity65 page			1
" everybody deserving gets their chance and moves on			0
would love to play under @entity30 in ' 14			2
" @entity71 , the last man to captain @entity25 more than once , agreed that @entity41 should not return			1
" @entity41 said himself , when he was inducted into the @entity77 , he intends to compete on the @entity27 seniors tour the moment he turns 50 this summer , " the 63 - year - old , who was skipper in 1991 , ' 93 and ' 95 , told the @entity76 newspaper			1
" so he will very quickly become out of touch with the players on the main tour			0
what message would that send to the other worthy candidates who are queuing up for the job , having earned their right to the captaincy just as much as @entity41 ? " @entity88 , who tied for seventh at @entity90 on sunday , has also spoken out against the chances of his compatriot @entity41			2
" he 's had his go			0
one time job for me , " the 1999 @entity95 champion wrote on @entity65			2
however , fellow professional @entity97 , who was on the committee that first appointed @entity41 , said the 49 - year - old might yet be picked again on tuesday in @entity100			1
" no - one would question his passion for the @entity13 and the effort he put into the captaincy in 2010 and i am sure he would do the same and maybe more this time around if he was to be asked			1
so that might be a possible scenario , " the @entity104 told the @entity106 newspaper			0
@entity24 , who finished joint last in the 33 - man @entity111 tournament , said he would not be interested in taking the job again			2
" first of all it 's a lot of energy and time , a huge demand and the pressure is quite big , " the @entity114 told the @entity116 @entity115			2
" even if it was held in @entity122 again somewhere down the line i would n't do it			0
@entity125 has also done it and was successful too			0
if i was him i would n't do it again , but @entity125 is his own man			0
" i am a strong believer that we have a generation of players that deserve the captaincy -- and some might miss out because there are just too many			0
i think it 's right to give those guys a chance			0
" read : @entity140 ' driving length stuns rivals the debate , which comes ahead of this week 's @entity143 featuring @entity1 and @entity144 , has taken some of the attention off @entity52 's remarkable come - from - behind victory in @entity90			1
the @entity50 has risen to a career - high fourth in the world rankings after wiping out @entity151 's five - shot lead within the first 11 holes of the final round			2
the 2010 @entity95 champion shot six - under - par 66 to win by one stroke , denying the @entity156 his second win in the city in the space of a month			0
it was his sixth victory on the @entity45 , lifting him up to second in the race to @entity164 standings behind world @entity165 , and his seventh top - 10 finish in his last eight starts			0
" it 's a great start to the year , i knew i had to come out and get my name up there , " the 30 - year - old said			1
@entity151 , who won the @entity173 in december to qualify for the limited field , almost forced a playoff when his eagle chip attempt at the last hole stopped just short of the hole			0
" louis 's a major champion -- there 's no shame in losing to him , " the 29 - year - old said			1
meanwhile , rookies @entity184 and @entity186 took a three - shot lead into the final round of the @entity190 's @entity189 in @entity191 on sunday			2
the @entity27 were being chased by @entity50 @entity192 , while another newcomer -- @entity195 @entity194 -- was tied for fourth with @entity27 tour stalwart @entity197 .			0
