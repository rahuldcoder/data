-- if the @entity3 founder @entity2 could have magically transported himself forward to the100th edition and discovered that the hot favorite was @entity6 - born briton @entity7 , with not a @entity9 contender in sight , then he might have abandoned the idea altogether			1
@entity2 and his editorial colleagues on the newspaper @entity13 came up with the idea of a cycle race around @entity9 to boost its flagging circulation and a @entity18 winner was the last thing they would have wanted			1
@entity21 duly obliged in the 1903 edition , but more importantly the " @entity27 " had successfully captured the @entity9 public 's imagination and with the exception of two world wars has been raced every year since			0
despite a raft of doping scandals -- this year 's @entity3 is the first since @entity31 confessed to cheating and was stripped of his seven titles -- and the tragic deaths of leading riders such as @entity35 and @entity36 -- its popularity as the greatest free sporting spectacle in the world has endured			1
for a race conceived by a journalist , it has undoubtedly provided rich material to fill countless column inches , not to mention ample opportunities for their photographic colleagues to capture the drama of the moment and @entity9 's stunning scenery			0
mapping @entity3 , published in conjunction with the centenary race , chronicles the history of the race in images and route maps of each year , plus a stage - by - stage preview of the 2013 edition			1
it reveals that the @entity3 has visited every region of @entity9 apart from @entity59 -- so fittingly , and to mark the special anniversary , this year 's race will start saturday with three road stages on the hilly @entity63 island			1
@entity65 's greatest tourist destination the peloton returns to the mainland for a short team time trial in @entity69 before setting off on a clockwise route around @entity9			0
for the first time since the 2003 race , which marked the actual centenary of the @entity3 , all 3,360 kilometers will be on @entity9 soil , a move designed organizers say to " showcase the splendors of the world 's greatest tourist destination			1
" @entity7 , who began his cycling career racing bmx and mountain bikes near his birthplace of @entity83 , and the other leading contenders will be too busy to appreciate the delights of the terrain in the @entity87 and @entity88 , but for the millions of spectators who line the route it 's an added attraction			2
last year @entity7 finished second to @entity93 teammate @entity92 as he became the first @entity95 rider to win overall honors in the famous three - week race			1
last month @entity98 withdrew from the 2013 edition after sustaining injuries in the @entity101 , leaving the way apparently clear for @entity7 to lay his claim to the storied yellow jersey			1
" it 's got to be our focus to try and get yellow , make that the number one goal , " @entity7 told the @entity95 's @entity109 on the eve of the race friday			1
his @entity115 teammate @entity114 is also tipped to fulfill the major supporting role that @entity7 himself played for @entity98 last year			2
" i do n't see why porte could n't be on the podium come @entity120 , " @entity7 added			2
" there 's a lot of road ahead but that would be the dream scenario for us			0
" doping controversies but as the riders gathered in @entity59 , the shadow of doping controversies continued to hog the headlines			0
@entity31 was quoted in the @entity9 daily @entity132 claiming that the route to success still lay in taking performance enhancing drugs			2
" it 's impossible to win the @entity3 without doping because the @entity3 is an endurance event where oxygen is decisive , " he said			1
the disgraced @entity141 -- who dominated the tour from 1999 to 2005 , added : " i simply took part in this system			0
i 'm a human being			0
" coming a week after @entity31 's arch rival @entity147 finally confessed he too had taken blood boosting drugs such as @entity150 , it was the last thing the organisers needed as the sport seeks yet another fresh start			1
@entity115 @entity155 rider and 2011 champion @entity154 , one of the major challengers to @entity158 , took exception to @entity31 's remarks			2
" i think the opposite			0
i am proof that that is not true , " @entity154 told gathered reporters in @entity163			0
" i sometimes read in the press what @entity31 says and i respect him as a human being , but really i just focus on doing my own job as best i can and fortunately we are supported by a great group of people			2
" angry @entity172 five - time @entity3 champion @entity172 strongly defended his sport when asked about @entity175 's reported comments by @entity0 affiliate @entity176			1
the @entity9 legend said that if other sports were as tightly controlled as cycling " we would be laughing for five minutes			0
" he angrily added " one has to stop thinking that cyclists are drug addicts , thugs			0
" @entity7 's other likely rival , @entity184 @entity183 , has himself served a ban after giving a positive test for the banned steroid clenbuterol on the way to winning the 2010 edition , the title later awarded to @entity191 of @entity192			1
@entity193 's @entity183 has always protested his innocence and his route to redemption may well lie in the 2013 race , which takes in 28 mountain ascents , four of which finish at the top , suiting his climbing abilities			2
away from the battle for yellow , sprinting stars such as @entity95 's @entity204 and @entity206 @entity205 will battle it out for the green points jersey on the flatter stages			0
@entity204 , led out by @entity98 , crossed the line first on @entity211 last year , his 23rd tour stage win , closing fast on the all - time record of 34 by the five - time overall winner @entity214 of @entity215			0
international appeal it is unlikely a home rider will add to @entity9 's record 38 overall victories , the last of which came from @entity172 back in 1985 , but @entity2 would surely have been proud of how his creation has gained such international appeal			0
since it 's first incursion into the @entity224 in 1954 , the @entity3 has visited major capitals such as @entity226 and @entity227 , while the 2014 race will start in the @entity230 northern county of @entity231			2
@entity233 @entity232 , an outspoken critic of @entity31 , was the first @entity235 winner of the @entity3 in 1986 and @entity98 ' historic victory last year is likely to continue this trend as the well financed @entity93 squad has the resources and rider lineup to dominate for the foreseeable future			1
