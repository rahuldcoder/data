sen. @entity0 is trying to shed the perception that he 's an isolationist and that he thinks the @entity2 should retreat from intervention in other countries ' affairs			1
but members of his own party are making it hard for the @entity9 @entity8 to escape that image			2
sen. @entity12 , one of the most hawkish members of the @entity14 , told @entity16 host @entity15 on tuesday night that @entity0 has " a fundamental lack of understanding of the situation and the threats we face " from @entity22			1
referring to @entity0 's evolving position on @entity22 , @entity12 said the libertarian - leaning senator " has obviously been doing somersaults " since the @entity27 militant group gruesomely killed two @entity2 journalists and a @entity30 aid worker			1
@entity0 , who is seriously considering a presidential run in 2016 , responded to his critics in an interview released wednesday in the @entity34 , telling the conservative @entity36 magazine how " frustrating " these labels are for him			1
" i spent the past five years in public life telling everyone that ' hey , i 'm not an isolationist ' ... and when they find out i 'm not , they say i 've switched positions , because i 'm not the position they were saying i was			0
you know what i mean ? so for five years they 've been accusing me of being something that i say i 'm not			0
" but @entity12 apparently does n't buy this explanation			2
he said @entity0 has " dramatically shifted his positions on national security			2
he said we should n't intervene , no matter what , anywhere			0
and now obviously he wants to take out @entity22			2
" " i think it 's kind of a desperation kind of trying to find some footing here as he slides down a very steep slope of credibility			0
" former vice president @entity61 has also been critical of @entity0 's foreign policy stance			1
on @entity64 's " @entity63 " in june , @entity61 described him as " basically an isolationist			1
that did n't work in the 1930s ; it sure as heck wo n't work in the aftermath of 9/11			0
" facing such vocal opposition in the @entity8 , @entity0 continues to battle the image of an isolationist with shifting views			1
@entity0 told @entity74 " @entity82 " earlier this week that his perception of @entity22 has evolved as world events changed , adding that the killings of @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 " influenced " his position			1
@entity0 has said he does n't back arming @entity85 rebels , a position @entity12 has supported since @entity85 's civil war broke out three years ago			1
but @entity0 has been noncommittal on what the @entity2 should do except that the @entity88 should determine the path forward			2
in the @entity34 interview , @entity0 did n't deny that he 's skeptical of @entity2 intervention			0
" we have to be very wary of intervention and that there are often unintended consequences , " he said			0
" at the same time , i 've also said all along that i 'm not for no interventions			0
" @entity12 , however , remains skeptical			0
when @entity15 asked him if @entity0 would be a good commander in chief , he replied , " not on national security			0
no. " war against @entity22 : what does @entity0 's ' yes ' mean ?			1
