-- when travel author @entity2 was in @entity3 , she witnessed a group of young @entity6 male travelers rough - housing in the streets outside of the @entity8			1
americans traveling to sites around the world like the @entity11 in @entity12 should be respectful			0
in their youthful , loud exuberance , they ended up ripping each other 's shirts as they horsed around			0
" i thought to myself that those shirts probably cost maybe 20 , 30 , 40 dollars apiece , and here you are in a culture where the people may not be even making that much on a monthly basis			0
" it 's that sort of thing , just not being aware how off - putting that can be to the local culture			2
" such behavior , while seemingly harmless , can help to cement the moniker of " the ugly @entity6 , " which came to refer to loud , rude and thoughtless behavior of @entity6 citizens abroad			1
the term came about as a result of the book " @entity33 , " and more than 50 years after its publication , those from the @entity6 continue to battle an image of arrogance and nationalism			1
written by @entity40 and @entity41 , the novel chronicled @entity6 foreign policy and diplomacy failures in a fictitious developing nation			2
in the book , the @entity6 ambassador to the country is portrayed as crude and inept			1
that enduring legacy has not been easy to shake , and even the @entity6 president knows the score			1
during a recent trek to @entity53 , president @entity51 said in his remarks at the @entity55 in @entity12 that he knows the " stereotypes of the @entity6 are out there			1
" " sometimes it suggests that @entity6 has become selfish and crass , or that we do n't care about the world beyond us , " he said			1
" and i 'm here to tell you that that 's not the country that i know and it 's not the country that i love			2
" @entity2 , the author of the " @entity68 " guides and publisher of " traveling with kids , " often gives lectures and workshops -- many geared toward female travelers -- and speaks on the importance of @entity6 being stellar representatives of their homeland while abroad			2
" it 's about being respectful of the country and the culture , treating the people respectfully and not flashing around your money and your material possessions , " @entity2 said			1
" it 's up to every individual to be that ambassador and portray their country well			2
" author @entity88 wrote a piece for the @entity90 a few years ago about her desire not to be mistaken for an ugly @entity6 when her family traveled to @entity12 and the @entity53 coast			0
@entity88 took the step of vetoing one of her teenage son 's t - shirts , worried that the message on it , " @entity99			0
beat them ' til they reach consensus , " might be misunderstood in the @entity101 country			0
" i think that when you are a big and powerful country , it 's easy for the rest of the world to feel that you do n't deal with the kind of consideration and humility that other people do , " said @entity88 , who researches the areas she visits prior to her trips			0
ireport.com : ever been to the @entity117 ? share your travel pics @entity119 , who is a @entity121 travel expert and award - winning author of the best - selling guidebook " @entity121 , " said he has concerns about what will happen if and when travel restrictions are completely lifted from that country			1
he recalled two years ago when he was reviewing one of @entity130 's first five - star hotels that had just opened			0
standing in the lobby with one of the hotel 's executives , he witnessed a man , dripping wet from the pool and wrapped in a towel , emerge from the elevator			0
the man walked through the bar , down the stairs and into the marble lobby just as the staff tried to intercept him , @entity119 said			0
" i heard them say , ' we do n't allow guests in the lobby dressed this way , ' and the man said , ' yeah , i know ' in this deep @entity6 brogue , " @entity119 said			0
" behavior like that is not necessarily common to @entity6 , but it 's the type of thing that can give @entity6 a bad name			2
" manners and lifestyle expert @entity155 runs the site @entity158 and said @entity6 tend to be seen as free - spirited and not nearly as guarded as natives of some of the other countries -- as evidenced most recently by first lady @entity162 putting her arm around @entity165 's @entity164 " that 's something that maybe sent shivers up the spine of a lot @entity165 , but in the final analysis , people really looked at that as a nice gesture and something very @entity6 to do , " said @entity155 , who added that travelers should be as respectful in other countries as they would be if they were in someone else 's home			1
the @entity178 may actually be aiding in changing the perception themselves			0
travel writer @entity2 said the mere election of president @entity51 has helped to improve @entity6 's reputation worldwide			1
" it helped to change how we are viewed , but the real key is the behavior once a person arrives in a country , " @entity2 said			0
" some of [ the ugly @entity6 perception ] will exist no matter who is in office , and that 's why everyone has to take responsibility for being the very best representative of their country that they can			1

decades after the publication of " @entity33 , " the perception persists
president @entity51 spoke of perception of @entity6 as " selfish and crass "
travel expert urges visitors to be " respectful of the country and the culture "
election of @entity51 may be helping change @entity6 's reputation abroad
