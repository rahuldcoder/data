@entity0 -- for the @entity4 people of @entity5 , death is traditionally not something to be talked about or to be planned for , no matter how inevitable or close it may seem			2
but those close to @entity8 had little choice as the country 's first black leader lay in a @entity13 hospital and then at home in @entity0 on life support			1
in the final years of his life , secret plans were hammered out between the government , the military and his family as they prepared for a fitting farewell for a great man			0
below is a breakdown of how those plans will unfold over the next 10 days , culminating in a state funeral to be broadcast to millions worldwide and a very private farewell for those closest to him			1
as is often the case with events of this magnitude , plans might change due to weather , security and other factors			2
but for now , this is what the authorities and the family hope will happen			0
according to multiple sources involved with the planning of the final farewell to the @entity5 icon , the 10 days of mourning will combine both @entity48 traditions and those of the @entity50 , @entity8 's native clan			1
day 1 to day 4 @entity8 passed away at 8.50 p.m. thursday ( 1.50 p.m. et ) , surrounded by his family , @entity5 president @entity52 said			2
@entity1 understands that during his final hours , @entity8 would have also been surrounded by @entity50 elders			1
importantly , at some stage - either at his home or in the mortuary - the traditional leaders will gather for a first ceremony , a tradition called " the closing of the eyes			0
" throughout the ceremony , they 'll be talking to @entity8 , as well as to his tribal ancestors , to explain what 's happening at each and every stage to ease the transition from life to beyond			1
after the ceremony , it 's believed @entity8 's body will be embalmed at the mortuary , which is understood to be a military hospital in @entity13			1
day 5 no formal public events will be held until five days after @entity8 's death when tens of thousands of people are expected to converge on the @entity76 , known as @entity76 in @entity77 for a memorial service			1
it was at that stadium that in july 2010 @entity8 made his last public appearance at the @entity83 final			1
spectators rose to their feet , their cheers partly drowned out by the deafening shriek of thousands of vuvuzelas to pay tribute to the then - 92 - year - old who some had feared might be too infirm to show up			0
in stark contrast to the mood of elation , the atmosphere on day 5 is expected to hang heavy with grief as a nation mourns @entity8			2
it is unclear whether @entity8 's casket will be there			1
some world leaders might attend this memorial service instead of the state funeral later on in the week			0
a @entity105 tells @entity1 the administration is working on plans for president @entity108 to travel to @entity5 to attend the memorial service			1
day 6 to 8 according to sources , @entity8 's body will then lie in state for three days at the @entity113 in @entity13 , the seat of power of the @entity5 government			1
the first day will be reserved for dignitaries			0
the public will be allowed to file past his casket on days 7 and 8			2
viewing hours are expected to be limited to daylight			0
long lines will likely form from the very early hours of the morning			0
it was at the historic @entity113 that @entity8 was inaugurated as president on may 10 , 1994			2
on that extraordinary day , crowds converged around the building to witness history being made			0
that day , a former political prisoner achieved what was once unthinkable and became @entity5 's first post-apartheid black leader			0
day 9 nine days after @entity8 's death , a military aircraft will leave a @entity13 airbase and fly south to @entity134 , the main town in the @entity5 province of @entity136			1
@entity50 elders and members of the @entity8 family make the journey with @entity8 's casket			1
thousands of mourners are expected to line the streets from @entity134 airport to watch as the military transports @entity8 's casket on a gun carriage to the remote village of @entity148 , where the former leader spent his childhood years			1
along the way the procession is expected to pause for prayers to allow ordinary @entity5 to pay their respects			0
once at @entity8 's house , the military will formally pass responsibility for his remains to his family			1
the @entity5 flag that is expected to be draped over the coffin will be replaced with a traditional @entity4 blanket , symbolizing the return of one of their own			0
at dusk , @entity167 leaders , local chiefs and @entity8 's family are expected to gather for a private night vigil before a very public funeral the next day			1
day 10 the funeral and burial will be on the grounds of @entity8 's @entity148 home			1
it 's expected that thousands of people , including dozens of heads of state , will gather for the state funeral			0
the funeral will take place under a large tent nestled in the hills where @entity8 ran and played as a child			2
a tight military cordon is expected , in an attempt to assuage security fears			0
the event will be broadcast to an audience of millions around the world			0
at midday - when the summer sun is high in the sky - @entity8 will be buried into the rocky soil of his homeland			2
only a few hundred close family members will bid that final farewell to @entity8 as he is laid to rest			2
the burial area has been especially built for him ; some of @entity8 's long deceased family members are already buried at the site			1
it will be , according to custom , a homecoming			0
his grave site is surrounded by rocky outcrops , hardy grass used for the grazing cattle and bright orange aloe plants			0
the aloes are indigenous succulents which are hardy , drought - resistant , medicinal plants that bloom across the bushveld when all else is dry and dull			0
a symbolic floral gesture to a man whose life was filled with sacrifice and tragedy but who triumphed with a tenacity of spirit and hope in even the darkest of days .			0
