-- on a recent trip across @entity3 , what surprised me most was the number of people -- over 200 in one city , 80 to 150 elsewhere -- who wanted to discuss this odd word , " acedia			1
" it 's an ancient term signifying profound indifference and inability to care about things that matter , even to the extent that you no longer care that you ca n't care			1
i liken it to spiritual morphine : you know the pain is there but ca n't rouse yourself to give a damn			1
the concept of acedia was developed by @entity26 in the fourth century who had fled to the deserts of the @entity29 , opting for a simple life in rebellion against a newly legal , wealthy and politically powerful church			1
today , we would say that they went off the grid			0
these men and women quickly discovered that although they had left material possessions behind , they had n't shed their inner demons			2
they developed a sophisticated psychology of the " eight bad thoughts " that commonly troubled them , the most spiritually devastating of which were acedia , anger and pride			1
several centuries later , as the church developed its doctrine of the " seven deadly sins , " acedia was tucked into the sin of sloth , and the word disappeared from the common vocabulary			2
unless you were a student of monastic history or medieval literature , chances are , you would never encounter it			0
i wrote my book because i suspected that although the word " acedia " is unfamiliar to most of us , its effects are widely known			2
when i compared the classic descriptions of acedia with the plagues of contemporary society -- a toxic , nearly unbearable mix of boredom and restlessness , frantic escapism ( including that of workaholism ) , commitment - phobia and enervating despair -- i found the ancient demon of acedia in modern dress			2
@entity82 can manifest as either extreme lethargy or hyperactivity , but it is not merely an individual spiritual problem			1
it affects communities as well			0
and it was this aspect of acedia that my audiences wanted to discuss			2
they raised questions about addictions to the @entity94 and " virtual reality , " about fractured families who are so hyper - scheduled that they no longer spend much time together , about the dissonance of living in a society that is the wealthiest in history but whose citizens remain dissatisfied , gobbling up drugs for anxiety , depression and sleep disorders at an alarming rate			0
in hard economic times , we can lose faith in ourselves and others , and acedia offers a false sense of complacency and security			2
we can care about celebrities or online " friends " more than our neighbors ; we can treat rampant homelessness as just " the way things are , " and that relieves us from having to do anything about it			1
we can keep ourselves so busy that we do n't have time to care , or we can simply drop out of the fight			1
@entity82 feeds on " compassion fatigue " and assures us that the world 's problems are so big that we need not trouble ourselves about them			1
it 's useless to try to change things			0
if the @entity134 has made too much of the vice of pride , which seduces us into thinking too highly of ourselves , it has not made enough of sloth , which allows us to settle for being less than we can be , both as individuals and a society			0
as the late playwright @entity140 wrote in her book " @entity142 , " " when you achieve true slothdom , you have no desire for the world to change			0
... better to fall into line than to question the going ethos			0
" there is no certain remedy for acedia , any more than for anger and pride			1
it is part of the human condition			0
but we can learn to recognize it and resist it when it strikes			1
a method that was recommended by a @entity134 monk in the fourth century , and is also a technique employed in current cognitive behavioral therapy , is to " think about your thoughts			0
" when anger comes , or acedia , examine it dispassionately and try to figure out where it is leading you			0
there is no blame attached to having a " bad thought , " because they come to everyone			0
but we do have some choice in how we respond to them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			1

*author* : @entity82 is profound indifference and inability to care about things that matter
early @entity26 recognized acedia as one of " eight bad thoughts "
@entity181 : like spiritual morphine ; pain is there , but you ca n't give a damn
no remedy , but you can learn to recognize it and resist it
