@entity0 -- as the nation sent up a collective wail of grief over the 27 people slaughtered in @entity8 , @entity9 , last week , the nation 's leading gun rights lobby remained silent			1
the @entity10 , with roughly 4.3 million members , deactivated its @entity13 page , had stopped tweeting on its @entity15 account and had been issuing a " no comment " to any media outlet , including @entity1 , seeking a response			2
but late tuesday , the group broke that silence with a statement : " @entity22 is made up of four million moms and dads , sons and daughters -- and we were shocked , saddened and heartbroken by the news of the horrific and senseless murders in @entity8			1
out of respect for the families , and as a matter of common decency , we have given time for mourning , prayer and a full investigation of the facts before commenting			0
the @entity10 is prepared to offer meaningful contributions to help make sure this never happens again , " the group said			1
it plans to hold " a major news conference " on friday and both their @entity13 and @entity15 presences are active again			1
but despite the relative radio silence early on from the powerful lobbying group 's offices in @entity49 , @entity50 , the organization is regrouping in anticipation of a massive legislative push to introduce or , in some cases , reintroduce gun control legislation , say former @entity10 officers and gun policy experts			1
they had n't really spoken , some say , because they did n't have to do so			0
at least , not yet			0
@entity10 laid groundwork against new gun laws @entity60 , an associate professor of public policy and political science at @entity63 and author of " disarmed : the @entity71 for @entity72 in @entity73 , " said that strategy is part of the organization 's playbook after an incident such as this one			1
" the typical pattern is something horrific happens			0
there is a national outcry , mourning			0
people call for a national conversation on gun control			1
gun rights proponents lay low , " @entity60 said			2
" they 're used to seeing this cycle express condolences and hope the attention will shift to a new issue			0
" when the @entity10 does speak in detail , it will do so forcefully and with the type of political sway and heft the pro-gun lobby has carefully amassed over dozens of election cycles , experts say			2
" when the emotions come down , i 'm sure you 'll hear the @entity10 address this issue			2
it 'll be in january when legislation is introduced			0
they 'll testify at hearings			0
you 'll hear the same kind of arguments that i 'd come up with , " said @entity102 , who served as regional political director for the @entity10 during its rise to power in the 1980s and is president of a gun rights group , the @entity108			1
when that happens , the group will wield the full power of its millions of members and leverage the $ 17 million it spent in federal races this year helping elect candidates who it considers supporters of the @entity10 's mission , said policy experts			1
polls suggest public opinion may be changing " what we 're likely to see is the @entity10 being a part of the behind - the - scenes conversation , " said @entity124 , an associate sociology professor at @entity125 in @entity126 and author of the book " @entity129 : the @entity10 's @entity134			1
" that 's because in @entity0 's halls of power , what takes place behind closed doors often has more impact that what happens in the public eye			2
during the 2012 election cycle , the @entity10 donated $ 719,596 to candidates			2
republicans received $ 634,146 of that , according to the @entity151 ' analysis of federal campaign data			0
for example , @entity154 majority leader @entity153 , @entity50 , ranked among the top five recipients , having received $ 7,450 in this cycle			0
for the @entity10 , as with any good lobbying group , " democracy " is about " putting your money where your mouth is , " @entity102 said			1
@entity8 shooter 's guns : what we know according to the @entity168 , a government watchdog group , the @entity10 spends 66 times more on lobbying than what the @entity172 to @entity173 , the country 's top gun control advocacy organization , spends			1
and the @entity10 spends 4,143 times what the @entity172 spends on campaign contributions , the @entity168 found			2
but the group 's political power is n't just about money			0
" if you took money out of politics , that would n't weaken the @entity10			2
it would make it stronger			0
what @entity10 can do that ( mayor @entity189 ) @entity188 ca n't do is communicate with millions of people who care about this issue , " @entity102 said			2
even @entity193 presidential nominee @entity192 , who has had a mixed history on the issue of gun control , paid homage to the group during the general election			1
his first speech to a conservative audience after the contentious @entity193 primary season was at the @entity10 's annual meeting this spring , a speech in front of more than 60,000 gun enthusiasts in @entity207			1
lawmakers on gun control : ' this one feels different ' in 2012 , the group marshaled forces to lobby on more than 60 measures , including " a bill to prohibit the @entity215 from tracking and cataloging the purchases of multiple rifles and shotguns , " according to the @entity151 , which tracks money in politics			1
the legislation was sponsored by @entity223 sen. @entity222 and co-sponsored by 34 @entity193 and moderate @entity224 , including @entity226 @entity223 sen. @entity225			0
@entity225 is among a small group of conservative democrats with high rankings from the @entity10 for pro-gun rights legislative stances who has suggested revisiting gun control policies			1
however , on the sunday after the @entity8 shooting , not one of the 31 pro-gun rights senators with high @entity10 rankings agreed to go on @entity237 's " @entity239 " or @entity240 ' " @entity238			1
" the risk of daring to disagree with the @entity10 @entity154 members are similarly concerned			2
" there are many single - issue gun rights voters and @entity193 -- who now control the @entity154 -- know it 's a bad move to vote ( against the @entity10 ) , " said @entity124 said			1
" that 's a sure way to ensure there will be a primary opponent			0
" in the meantime , gun control advocates are hoping to capitalize on the bizarre rhythm that has become all too familiar in the wake of the nation 's mass shootings			1
however , when the @entity10 goes quiet , the normally outgunned opposition moves into high gear			2
@entity259 and @entity260 that 's because they know that after they mourn for the dead , there 's not much time , money or a broader platform to make their case for change before most people move on in their lives , said @entity273 , director of @entity259			0
his group has spent 20 - hour days on staff calls , legislative strategy sessions and fielding calls from gun violence survivors and celebrities and mayors who want to sign on			1
" look , " @entity273 said , " when this kind of thing happens , we have to make the case in that very short window -- what went wrong , why it went wrong , how you can fix it -- in a way that motivates @entity260 to do what it should			0
" the @entity172 was on @entity291 on tuesday with members of a new community group , @entity293			0
@entity293 tries to tackle the rough world of gun control policy @entity296 with the @entity297 said his group just hired temporary staff to deal with hundreds of new volunteers who want to help after @entity8			1
there 's usually a narrow window to make an impact , gun control advocates say			1
but this time , things may be different			0
" with something as terrible as this is , involving children , the window is open a little wider than it has been before , " @entity273 said			0
" i think my back of the envelope is usually about a month			0
but after the series of mass shootings and the gravity of this one , i think we may have a little more time			0
" @entity316 : gun industry faces uncertain future @entity1 's @entity319 and @entity320 contributed to this report .			0
