-- women are not powerless			1
it 's impossible not to be outraged by the capture of hundreds of @entity2 schoolgirls by a terrorist group , and by the inexcusable delay in pursuing the armed men who took them			1
for women , in particular , the continuing drama has ignited a particularly powerful response			1
women in many countries are vulnerable and victimized , but they are fighting back in unexpected places with the built - up fury of long held frustration			1
and they are getting results			1
women are no longer powerless			1
let there be no doubt : the reason the @entity23 is sending help , @entity2 is accepting it and the entire world is paying attention is that the women of @entity2 demanded it			1
@entity2 women from the town of @entity37 in the northeastern @entity39 state , the mothers , sisters , relatives and friends of the schoolgirls , launched their protests and set off the # @entity42 campaign that swept away weeks of international apathy			1
at a rally in @entity46 , one woman held up a sign that read " @entity48 ? " the long - delayed answer was a most emphatic " yes , " which resonated across the oceans and echoed in the @entity2 presidential palace			1
sure , the decisions are mostly up to male politicians , but in @entity57 , all the women members of the @entity56 , 20 of them , signed a letter to the president of the @entity23 demanding a firm response			2
they did it without hesitation and without regard to political affiliation			2
the tragedy of the @entity2 girls was grotesquely highlighted in a video by a laughing @entity68 , the leader of @entity69			1
he declared " @entity70 says i should sell			0
he commands me to sell			0
" the revolting message encapsulated the distilled essence of women 's plight in many corners of the world			1
and the response shows a phenomenon of both spontaneous and organized pushback from women 's groups , from the millions of men who join them , and from the forces that social media can unleash across cyberspace			1
it is a movement that begins with the grassroots , moves into cyberspace and powers its way into the halls of power			0
there is a reason that @entity97 has become a major international figure , a hero especially to women			2
it is , of course , about her bravery			0
gunmen belonging to the @entity107 @entity106 boarded the bus that was bringing the 14 - year - old champion of girls ' education and her friends from school			2
they shot her in the face			0
the @entity106 oppose girls ' education with that obsessive fervor displayed by the most radical @entity121 groups , who want to take all @entity123 back to the 7th century			1
they could not kill her and they could no silence her			0
instead , they made her stronger , and they made her voice louder			0
in @entity131 , when the @entity106 came to power , one of its first acts was to shut down women 's schools and ban women from universities			1
they did it under the guise of enforcing @entity140 rules			0
but they are nothing more than an excuse			0
like the @entity106 , @entity69 finds it particularly offensive that girls should receive an education			2
@entity147 appears on the latest video holding his @entity149 , offering his considered advice			0
" girls should go and get married , " he said , adding he would give them in marriage " at the age of 9 " ... at the age of 12 , " because they are our slaves			2
" it 's no wonder frustration is boiling over			2
consider the recent news from @entity163 's @entity162 province , where a woman was raped by eight men as punishment for having an affair			2
now an official @entity169 court has sentenced her to a humiliating public caning			0
and it 's not all about the work of @entity140 extremists			2
in late 2012 , emotions boiled over in @entity177 after the horrific gang rape of a student riding a city bus in @entity181			0
the woman came to be known as @entity183 , which means " the fearless one , " in @entity186			0
@entity183 , who had left home to study physiotherapy , had plans to show the @entity177 people that a woman could realize her dreams			0
she was planning to give free health care to the poor			0
instead , she died at 23 , when six men on the bus she took with her boyfriend attacked her with such brutality that she died from internal injuries			0
@entity183 shook @entity177 's women			1
in massive demonstrations @entity177 women joined by thousands of men demanded the government take action to stop the epidemic of rape			2
the government vowed to act , but there is much left to be done in a country dominated by men on all spheres of society			0
women endure the brunt of the worst aspects of repression and exploitation			1
as many as 30 million people are slaves today			0
most of them are sex slaves working in brothels and enduring other forms of captivity			0
and 98 % of the sex slaves are women and girls			1
cases like the @entity2 girls , still unaccounted for , and millions sold into bondage are the most urgent , the most dramatic			1
but they are only a part of the problem			0
they are so outrageous , so offensive , that they leave no room for moral equivocation			0
just a few days ago , the world was barely paying attention to @entity2 's abducted schoolgirls			1
today , the whole world is watching , help is on the way			2
that is what the women of @entity2 have accomplished -- not quite what @entity69 had in mind .			1

@entity253 : women of @entity2 got the world to pay attention to mass kidnapping of girls
@entity260 : women endure the brunt of the worst aspects of repression and exploitation
but women in many repressive countries are fighting back against *injustice* , she says
@entity260 : pushback from women 's groups *combined* with social media gets results
