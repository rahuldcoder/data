@entity2 boarded both of the planes that transported the remains to the @entity18 in @entity19 to pay his respects and later joined @entity5 , @entity7 and @entity11 special operations commander adm. @entity21 in meeting with more than 200 family members and colleagues of the slain service members at a building on the air base , according to background information provided by @entity29 staff members accompanying the president on the trip			1
@entity5 , @entity7 and the chiefs of the @entity34 and @entity35 were among the 11 senior military and @entity4 officials who also attended the dignified transfer , @entity4 spokesman col. @entity32 said			1
because the catastrophic nature of the crash made the remains difficult to identify , all were brought in more than 38 transfer cases to the @entity11 , @entity32 said			1
the @entity12 remains will be returned to their families once identifications can be made			1
the slain @entity11 service members represent the worst single - incident loss of @entity11 life since the start of the @entity12 war			1
thirty @entity11 died in the crash , including 22 @entity54 , military officials said			1
two @entity11 military officials said tuesday that @entity5 has been asked by @entity57 commanders not to release the names of the slain @entity54 because they belonged to a covert unit			1
even though many of the families have come forward and publicly identified their loved ones , the concern is that families and friends could be tracked down if they are identified , the officials said			0
according to the officials , they can not recall a time when names were not released 24 hours after next of kin were notified following an incident			0
initial reports on the incident said it occurred when a @entity75 unit became pinned down by insurgents in the rugged @entity78 area of @entity79 in central eastern @entity12			1
the group called in assistance but instead had to race to the crash scene of a downed @entity85 helicopter carrying their reinforcements , officials said monday			0
everyone inside the @entity89 helicopter was killed , @entity85 reported			2
helicopter pilot 's son : do n't forget about my dad however , a @entity11 military official confirmed tuesday that the @entity54 were called in as an ' immediate reaction force " when the @entity96 who were on the ground in a firefight saw some @entity100 break off and begin to escape			1
the @entity96 wanted the @entity54 to go after those insurgents , the official said , adding the @entity96 were " not pinned down " but simply wanted more combat power			2
the inbound helicopter transporting the @entity54 also carried a civilian interpreter and seven @entity12 troops , and it crashed after being " reportedly fired on by an insurgent rocket - propelled grenade			1
" on monday , the two military transport aircraft carrying the remains departed @entity111 airfield and headed to @entity18			2
the flights arrived tuesday morning , @entity32 confirmed			0
@entity113 , the public affairs chief for @entity114 , said all of the 38 sets of remains were " unidentifiable			1
" " the crash they were in was so horrific and the state of remains such that there was no easy way to see this was this person or this was that person , " @entity113 told reporters			2
in a typical dignified transfer ceremony , family members and military carry teams board the plane , @entity113 said , adding that a chaplain may be asked to speak			1
the carry team then picks up the transfer case , and the command is given to render honors , according to @entity113			0
the official party and everyone within earshot salutes as the remains are taken from the aircraft to a waiting vehicle for transport to the mortuary , where positive identification occurs , he said			1
" for us ... it is a very big source of pride and a sense of duty and honor that we give to the fallen service members and their families , " @entity113 said			2
" we represent the nation , and a grateful nation at that			0
" in an earlier statement , the commander of the @entity158 in @entity12 , gen. @entity159 , paid tribute to the fallen			1
" in life they were comrades in arms , and in death they are bound forever in this vital cause			0
we cherish this selfless sacrifice , " @entity159 's statement said			0
" today , as we pay our respects to these magnificent troops , we recommit ourselves for the future , and for the freedom , peace and stability of @entity12			1
" @entity2 has been meeting with @entity11 military officials about the incident and spoke with @entity12 president @entity177 by phone sunday			1
" we will press on , and we will succeed , " @entity2 said monday , adding that " now is also a time to reflect on those we lost " and on the sacrifices of all who have served , as well as their families			2
" their loss is a stark reminder of the risks that our men and women in uniform take every single day on behalf of their country , " @entity2 said , discussing the incident at the end of televised remarks focused on the economy			2
until monday , military officials had been largely tight - lipped about the circumstances surrounding the crash , which occurred roughly 60 miles southwest of @entity199			0
the events leading up to the crash began when insurgents -- armed with rocket - propelled grenade launchers and @entity205 assault rifles -- engaged in small - arms fire with coalition forces on the ground , @entity85 reported			0
@entity158 forces were carrying out an operation targeting a known @entity100 leader in the area			0
several militants were killed in the gunbattle , officials said			2
