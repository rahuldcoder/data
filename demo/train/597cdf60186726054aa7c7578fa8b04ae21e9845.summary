the @entity0 has announced a discovery 7,200 miles above @entity2 of a protective shield similar to the force fields you might see in " @entity6			1
" the discovery of this barrier in the @entity10 radiation belts suggests a new explanation for how " killer electrons " are held at bay			1
this invisible shield , which was found at the inner edge of the outer @entity10 belt , protects against high - energy electrons , which have the potential to fry satellites , threaten astronauts and degrade space systems during intense solar storms			2
" it 's almost like these electrons are running into a glass wall in space , " said @entity23 , director of @entity0 's @entity24			0
" somewhat like the shields created by force fields on ' @entity6 ' that were used to repel alien weapons , we are seeing an invisible shield blocking these electrons			2
it 's an extremely puzzling phenomenon			0
" the phenomenon challenges existing theories that these electrons drift into the upper atmosphere and are destroyed by air molecules			1
" it 's like looking at the phenomenon with new eyes , with a new set of instrumentation , which give us the detail to say , ' yes , there is this hard , fast boundary , ' " said @entity40 , associate director of @entity42 's @entity41 and a study co-author			0
does this have any potential for scientific innovation into force fields on @entity2 ? only time will tell , of course .			0
