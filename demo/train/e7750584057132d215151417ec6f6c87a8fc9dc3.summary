-- the annual festival of conspiracy theorizing , belligerent fist - shaking and anxious masculinity known as the @entity6 convention came to @entity7 over the weekend , and it was everything the organizers hoped it would be			1
tens of thousands of attendees perused 500 booths where you could look at guns , buy guns , learn about guns , talk about guns and maybe weep about guns , along with plenty of training courses to prepare you for the day when society breaks down and you finally get the chance to use that arsenal to defend your home against marauding gangs of cannibals			0
@entity6 has record conference turnout , new president one favorite was the trainer who advised people to keep a gun locked up in their kids ' room			1
because what could possibly go wrong ? oh yeah -- accidents			0
they could shoot each other , such as the 5 - year - old who recently shot his 2 - year - old sister , or the 13 - year - old who shot his 6 - year - old sister			0
this being an @entity6 gathering , there were media figures and politicians aplenty			1
@entity51 , fresh off suggesting that a man who shot himself last week at @entity7 airport 's was a part of a @entity56 fire - like conspiracy to pave the way for a fascist crackdown on @entity59 , gave the keynote address			1
prominent politicians who appeared included @entity63 gov. @entity62 , former presidential candidate @entity64 , @entity66 gov. @entity65 , sen. @entity67 of @entity63 and @entity68			1
they have something in common , beyond the fact that they 've all run for president before or might in 2016			0
like the @entity6 itself , they all camp out on the conservative fringe but are nevertheless convinced that they represent the mainstream			1
@entity62 , who calls @entity80 " a monstrous lie " and has flirted in the past with the idea that @entity63 should secede from the @entity59 , thought that what @entity59 wanted in a president was @entity86 without the intellectual pretensions			1
turned out , not so much			0
@entity65 recently suffered a political setback when he proposed cutting the ( progressive ) income tax and raising the ( regressive ) sales tax , i guess because poor people in @entity66 have just been having it too easy			0
even his conservative state recoiled , and @entity65 's approval ratings plummeted			0
@entity67 has cut a @entity97 swath through @entity98 in his four months there , leading to rare agreement between @entity100 and @entity101 that he 's an enormous jerk			0
naturally , he 's seriously considering a run for president in 2016			0
and as for the former half - term governor of @entity106 ? well , you already know about her			0
all of them believe they represent the real @entity59 , and if the country just had a chance to hear their unvarnished views , they could win the @entity116 with ease			1
that most real @entity59 find that idea either laughable or terrifying does n't seem to register with them			1
they 're right at home with the @entity6 , which just selected as its president a man who still refers to the @entity121 as " the war of northern aggression , " and has such a twisted view of liberty that he believes the freedom to buy an @entity128 at a gun show without having to fill out a form is as important as freedom of speech or religion			1
eighteen years ago , after a right - wing anti-government extremist bombed the @entity135 in @entity136 , killing 168 men , women and children , @entity6 ceo @entity133 railed against the threat from " jackbooted government thugs " in " @entity142 bucket helmets			2
" in response , former president @entity144 wrote the group an outraged letter defending those who work for the government , including one @entity151 agent killed in @entity136 who had worked on @entity144 's detail in the @entity116			0
" he was no @entity142 , " @entity144 wrote , and resigned his @entity6 life membership in disgust			2
in the time since , the @entity6 has become even more extreme , even more paranoid , even more ensconced in its self - reinforcing world in which guns are all that matter			2
there may be a few @entity100 who now have the courage to stand up to them			2
but there are still plenty such as @entity62 , @entity67 and @entity68 , who will troop to their convention and jump into their festering pool of anger and fear			1
they do n't seem to realize how it makes them smell			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			2

prominent conservatives gathered to support the @entity6 at its convention in @entity7
@entity174 : these politicians are on the fringe but believe they represent the mainstream
he says the views of @entity62 , @entity64 and @entity68 are not those of real @entity59
@entity174 : there may be just a few *republicans* who are brave enough to stand up to the @entity6
