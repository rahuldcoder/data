-- the rev. @entity1 , often called @entity3 's most influential pastor , will be hosting sens. @entity4 and @entity5 for what 's being called the civil forum on the presidency			1
@entity1 will be hosting the civil forum on the presidency @entity1 , who heads up the country 's fourth largest church , is also an author whose books have sold more than 30 million copies			1
the candidates will appear together at @entity1 's 20,000 - member @entity16 mega-church in southern @entity17 where they each will be interviewed for an hour			1
@entity1 spoke with @entity18 on @entity0 's @entity19 about what he hopes to accomplish at the forum			1
@entity18 : what do you want to hear from candidates saturday night ? @entity1 : you know , @entity5 , we 're going to look at four different segments			1
one is a segment on leadership			0
what is the personal character , competence , and experience of each of these guys			0
one section will be on what i call stewardship -- the role and responsibility of presidency , what they believe about the constitution , the role of @entity3			1
we 're going to look at a section on world view -- all of the minefield questions that no matter how you answer them , somebody 's not going to like it			1
then we 're going to look at @entity3 's role internationally			1
how we 've been a blessed nation and how should we bless others			0
@entity18 : are you going to ask them about issues like abortion and same - sex marriage ? pro-life advocates are hoping you do			2
there has been some criticism in some corners you have been soft - pedaling political issues that are central to evangelicals			2
@entity1 : i think everybody will be surprised			1
i 'm going to ask all of the tough questions			1
i just intend to ask them in a civil way			2
this is called a civil forum , which means you can disagree without demonizing the opposition			1
i think everybody wants to hear questions not just about those " moral issues , " but also about a lot of other things , too			1
i 'm trying to stake out a common ground for the common good			2
@entity18 : when you take a look at the evangelical vote in 2004 , @entity87 captured more than 75 percent of people who identify themselves as either born again or evangelical			1
our recent polling , @entity95 polls , found when it comes to @entity5 , only 67 percent of evangelicals say they 'll support him			0
are you surprised at the shift ? @entity1 : it 's interesting to me			1
both of these men have been around for some time			0
@entity4 's written two books			2
still a lot of people say , i 'd like to know the real person			0
what are they really like ? i 'm hoping that 'll happen in this forum			2
evangelicals have never been a monolithic voting base			0
and the people who try to predict which way they 're going to go in this election i think may be surprised after @entity117			1
you do n't really know			2
i do n't know , and i do n't think anybody knows			2
@entity18 : as you know , @entity5 in 2000 during the primaries ran afoul of evangelicals when he criticized @entity123			0
he 's tried to repair the relationship			2
has he gone far enough ? @entity1 : the religious right , fundamentalists and evangelic evangelicals are n't synonyms for each other			1
i think @entity5 may have been talking about certain groups that he was worried about at that time			0
but he certainly rebuilt bridges among them today			0
it 's just a question of whether they 're going to vote on his issues or if they 're going to vote on @entity4 's , and we 'll see			1
@entity18 : as for you yourself in the most recent edition of @entity144 on which you 're the cover , they 've suggested you 're evolving into the " superpolitical			0
" others have suggested you 're becoming a spiritual entrepreneur			0
what do you make of the titles people are ascribing to you ? @entity1 : when you try to line out a middle ground -- common ground for the common good of @entity3 -- you get pot shots from both sides			1
if i were just the left , i 'd only get it from the right			0
if i were just the right , i 'd only get it from the left			0
because i believe in the monogood and do n't happen to think either party gets it right all the time			0
i do n't think anybody bats 1,000			0
i get it from both sides			0
that 's to be expected .			0

those who think they can predict the evangelical vote may be surprised , @entity1 says
pastor plans to ask candidates about @entity3 's role internationally
@entity1 : forum wo n't just focus on " moral issues , " but try to find a middle ground
tough questions will be asked , but in a civil way , pastor says
