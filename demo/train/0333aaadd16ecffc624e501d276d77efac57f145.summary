-- despite calls from president @entity4 to beef up the program designed to provide security aboard @entity8 flights , the @entity2 is in disarray , a @entity0 investigation has found			1
in more than a dozen interviews across the country , air marshals said the agency is rife with cronyism ; age , gender and racial discrimination ; and attempts by managers to make the agency appear more efficient than it is by padding numbers			1
air marshals describe an agency in chaos , where bored and frustrated marshals focus more on internal squabbles than watching for bad guys			1
the marshals refused to let their identities be known , for fear of retaliation in an agency that is driven , they say , by intimidation and favoritism			1
after a @entity38 's attempt to blow up an airliner preparing to land in @entity40 , @entity41 , on christmas day , a growing number of critics have called for either the elimination or a total overhaul of the agency			1
last week , president @entity4 asked @entity45 for an additional $ 85 million to boost the air marshals program , known by its acronym @entity2 , after the foiled attack aboard the jet coming from the @entity50			1
@entity8 officials have charged @entity38 @entity52 with attempting to blow up the airliner			0
he was subdued by passengers and crew			0
no air marshals were on the flight , generating additional criticism of the service			1
despite efforts by @entity4 and assurances by @entity64 secretary @entity63 that @entity2 will become more effective , one air marshal told @entity0 , " nothing 's particularly changed for me since christmas day , or ( for ) a big percentage of people that i work with			1
everything is pretty much the same			0
" in january , @entity69 testified before a @entity71 committee , where she vowed , " we will strengthen the capacity of aviation law enforcement , including the @entity2			0
" international flights are considered to have the highest risk			0
however , air marshals from a half dozen @entity2 field offices said the agency continues to assign marshals to short , regional routes on small jets			1
the marshals told @entity0 that lots of short - haul flights make the agency look more productive on paper			1
the marshals said if someone dares criticize a manager , he or she can be banished to what they call " @entity92 , " referring to the regional trips			2
managers and favored employees receive the perk of traveling international routes , they said			2
repeatedly , air marshals reported that the decision on who flies on what flights are driven by extra pay for managers , and office politics -- not security			1
despite repeated requests , @entity2 and its parent agency , the @entity105 , declined to give @entity0 an interview			1
however , @entity105 spokesman @entity108 provided a statement , saying , " the @entity105 's @entity2 are strategically deployed aboard @entity8 flagged air carriers to ensure the safety and security of the traveling public			2
" the @entity2 is currently training and deploying fellow federal law enforcement officers to support the administration 's enhancement in aviation security			0
@entity2 and these additional highly trained officers are being deployed aboard an increasing number of flights worldwide to keep air travel safe , " @entity108 wrote			2
rep. @entity121 , @entity122 , is one of @entity2 ' harshest critics			2
" it 's just a total waste of money , " he told @entity0 in a recent interview			1
" i know that any time you create a federal bureaucracy , it just grows and grows , and the appropriation just goes up and up , but ... look at the record			0
they have n't done anything			0
" " i had the statistic from last year , " the @entity136 said			0
" they made four arrests for an appropriation of $ 800 million			0
it came out to more than $ 200 million per arrest			0
" rep. @entity144 , @entity145 , does n't want @entity2 eliminated , she wants it revamped			0
" if we 've got those kinds of problems , we need to get a ready broom and sweep , " she said			0
" the only way we are going to ensure the security and safety of the @entity8 people is that we have staff par excellence , and i know they are out there			0
" although the actual number of air marshals is classified , it has been widely reported that the number of air marshals covering 28,000 flights per day is fewer than 4,000			1
even with a generous calculation , the marshals only cover 5 percent of flights , according to @entity0 assessments			1
@entity0 has been studying @entity2 for three years , and during that time , air marshals have accused managers of using creative accounting to pad the numbers given to @entity45			1
they describe an agency in chaos that , in some cases , promotes discrimination against minorities			1
" we do n't have managers who provide training or provide leadership or do anything other than produce conflict , " one said			2
@entity180 , a political science professor at @entity181 , has completed a cost - benefit analysis of @entity8 aviation security			0
he concluded many measures such as @entity2 are little more than a waste of taxpayer dollars			2
" we have seen with the underwear bomber ( @entity52 ) , the passengers are n't going to sit around waiting for someone else to do something			0
because their lives are at stake , they are going to jump in			0
so essentially from a hijackers ' standpoint , this idea of replicating 9/11 is close to impossible as far as i can see , " @entity180 said			0
the air marshal program was set up in 1970 , after a rash of airline hijackings , and it was expanded significantly after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001			2
specially trained to safeguard passengers and crew aboard crowded aircraft , air marshals were seen as a critical component in the overall effort to secure @entity8 's commercial aviation system			1
@entity0 's @entity207 contributed to this report .			2
