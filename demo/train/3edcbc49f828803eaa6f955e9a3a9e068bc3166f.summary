@entity2 , @entity3 the man suspected of killing two people in @entity2 swore fidelity to @entity7 leader @entity6 in a posting made on what 's apparently his @entity10 page just before the weekend shooting spree			1
the post pledges " allegiance to @entity6 in full obedience in the good and bad things			1
and i wo n't dispute with him unless it is an outrageous disbelief			1
" the suspect in saturday 's attack has been named as @entity21 , a senior member of the @entity3 government said			1
the gunman opened fire at a free speech forum in @entity2 on saturday before shooting several people outside a synagogue and then firing at police			1
police killed him in the shootout			1
the nation began the healing process monday night with a candlelight vigil at which @entity3 prime minister @entity33 appealed for national unity			1
authorities estimated more than 40,000 attended the event			1
" an attack on @entity3 's @entity39 is an attack on everyone , " she said			1
" the jewish community is an important part of @entity3			1
we will stand together and continue the everyday life we know			1
we stand together as @entity3			1
" @entity45 , a @entity46 artist who attended saturday 's forum , believes he was likely the target of the attack			1
he escaped unharmed and told @entity4 on monday he has gone into hiding			1
@entity45 , known for his controversial depictions of the @entity52 , is on an @entity53 hit list			1

@entity61 told @entity4 that the two , who pleaded not guilty , have not been charged under @entity3 's anti-terrorism laws			1
at a news conference earlier monday , @entity33 said that the suspect was linked to a criminal group but at this stage , there are no known ties to a terror cell			2
however , investigators do not rule out that the attacks might have been inspired by last month 's terror attacks in @entity80			2

so he had an advantage , " @entity45 told @entity4			2
" several of the policemen ( were ) wounded but still they tried to fire back			2

police have not identified the deceased , but the @entity112 said he was director @entity113			1
@entity114 , who has survived two previous attempts on his life , became a target after his 2007 cartoon depicting the prophet with the body of a dog , an animal that conservative @entity123 consider unclean			2
" it should be possible to insult all religions in a democratic way , " @entity45 said after that cartoon published			2
" if you insult one ( religion ) , then you should insult the other ones			2
" like @entity132 editor @entity131 , who was killed in the @entity80 attack , @entity45 was one of nine faces on a " @entity139 " graphic published by @entity53 's @entity136 for " crimes against @entity138			0

he was a member of the @entity178 basketball club in @entity2 , club board member @entity176 said			0
" @entity179 is in shock about the attack , but everyone 's thoughts are first and foremost with @entity175 's family and friends , and with the wounded police officers and their families , " the group said			0
@entity189 and her husband , @entity190 , were holding the bat mitzvah party for their daughter			0
she told @entity4 she feels angry at what happened , but also tremendous gratitude toward @entity196			0
" we will remember that we owe our lives to him , and we will try and do our very best to be deserving of that , " she said			0
police said they are investigating both shootings as possible terror attacks			0
police identified the suspect from surveillance footage that shows him getting into a taxi after one of the attacks , @entity2 police investigator @entity204 said			1

" he said when officers tried to contact the suspect at the @entity2 apartment sunday , the suspect opened fire			0
police fired back , killing the gunman			0

as far as police know , he had not traveled to @entity88 or @entity89			0
the gunman was recently in jail after being convicted of stabbing another young man with a knife several times on a commuter train , @entity230 said			1
authorities are " operating under a theory " that the gunman may have been inspired by the january terror attacks in @entity255 , said @entity251 , chief of the @entity252			0
seventeen people died in the @entity80 attacks , which began with an assault on the offices of the satirical magazine @entity132			0
the magazine had published controversial images of the @entity52			0
why @entity138 forbids images of @entity52 the @entity132 attack renewed attention on networks of extremists operating in @entity268			0
shortly after the events in @entity80 , police in @entity270 conducted a raid where two suspected extremists were killed in a shootout			0
