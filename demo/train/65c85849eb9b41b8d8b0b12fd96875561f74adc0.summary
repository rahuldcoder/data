-- @entity2 @entity1 , 31 , travels constantly for her corporate music business @entity3 -- logging trips to @entity6 , @entity7 and across @entity8			0
but she 's no longer flying business class			0
" economy has become the new black , " says @entity10			0
fortunately , even as cash - strapped airlines raise fees and cut services , there 's a countervailing trend that has gone largely unnoticed by disgruntled travelers : economy class is getting better			1
some airlines are introducing amenities and getting creative with seat design to lure budget - minded travelers like @entity10			1
where once business class was the primary revenue engine , it 's increasingly important that every cabin and every seat is both profitable and comfortable			1
this change started in the early 1990s , when safety certification changes forced airlines to tweak their seats across the craft , explains @entity35 of @entity36			1
new materials like aluminums and titaniums have brought about new design possibilities , he says , and due to the rising price of fuel , " there 's pressure on airlines to have seats that are lighter and more comfortable			1
" @entity0 : @entity48 's best hotels 2011 leave it to the @entity50 to engineer a simple - yet - brilliant upgrade to economy - class seating			1
@entity53 embraced seat manufacturer @entity56 's pioneering design , purchasing 32,000 new seats across the fleet			1
the seats themselves have been thinned down ( without compromising comfort ) and the magazine pouch shifted from knee height to behind the tray table to increase legroom			0
there 's no better catalyst for change than competition , lately in the form of new models : the @entity72 and the @entity73			0
as airline companies snap up these new planes , they have a chance to reimagine the economy - class cabin in hopes of placating both profit - seeking shareholders and comfort - craving passengers			1
@entity84 's @entity83 , for instance , is outfitting its new 787 fleet with gender - segregated bathrooms that have windows and bidet - toilets ( " @entity91 " ) that offer warm , pressurized water jets for a fresher clean than one - ply paper			1
of course , not all creative ideas take flight			1
the semi-standing @entity95 seat that would offer just 23 " of legroom -- an experience compared to riding horseback -- was widely shunned last year			1
but travelers have ( literally ) embraced a revolutionary loveseat - like arrangement for couples that @entity102 has nicknamed " @entity103			1
" it 's an economy - class row of three seats that converts to a bed with the touch of a button			1
now if only they could come up with a seat that prevents jet lag			1
@entity112 economy - class innovation : breathe - easy cabins			1
@entity112 will soon be using brand - new 787s , which have a hidden plus for cramped , germ - riddled economy cabins : a state - of - the - art air filter and cooling system			1
it strips ozone from outside air , and uses a hepa filter to blitz bacteria and viruses , and then a gas filter to take out any nasty smells			1
the result : cleaner , fresher air throughout an entire flight			1
although @entity112 will be one of the first to help passengers breathe more easily , it 's not the only carrier : @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , and @entity138 / @entity137 will also be flying @entity139 outfitted with this filter and cooling system			1
@entity0 : ode to the never - ending packing list @entity143 economy - class innovation : @entity145 without a big price hike			2
many airlines now have some kind of upgraded economy option , but usually for a hefty premium			2
@entity143 is bravely trying to buck the trend with its new @entity153 class , available on 160 aircraft beginning in summer 2011			0
free for @entity157 and @entity158 regulars , and otherwise offered at a scaling fee ( nominal for @entity160 and @entity161 ) , this new section has plenty to recommend it : priority boarding ; 50 percent more recline ; four extra inches of legroom ; adjustable headrest and , on some carriers , footrest ; and free drinks throughout the flight			0
cheers ! @entity173 economy - class innovation : improved in - seat entertainment			1
it may share a name with one of the @entity179 clan , but @entity181 's @entity173 entertainment system delivers more than just reality stars			0
it 's like a hybrid of @entity185 and @entity186 with 80 on - demand movies , 180 tv programs , a dozen radio channels with hundreds of songs and @entity192 headphones for everyone			2
on almost every aircraft , the airline is rolling out international @entity196 with @entity197 for a small fee			0
and even in economy there are usb ports for charging -- or for preparing presentations using a thumb drive and the built - in office software			2
@entity0 : most complained - about airlines @entity102 economy - class innovation : a bed at your fingertips			1
imagine if an economy row of three seats could convert to a bed with the touch of a button			0
well , @entity216 's @entity215 does exactly that : arms retract , the seat base extends , and the seatbelts lengthen to buckle up when reclining			2
two passengers can snuggle horizontally , leaning against the wall or lying flat			0
and the price is a steal : pay a standard fare for each seat , and the third shared berth is half price -- or a 25 percent per - person premium			1
by the end of 2012 , every flight to @entity8 will offer this " cuddle class			0
" until then , @entity216 has a last - minute trick to help economy passengers sleep soundly on all its long - haul flights			2
if available , an empty neighboring seat can be purchased for a bargain price at check - in ( often less than $ 60 one way )			1
@entity241 economy - class innovation : gourmet treats and a toiletry kit			2
forget packing a sandwich at home or worrying about running low on snacks onboard @entity241 's long - haul flights to @entity7			2
the airline now offers passengers many of the delicious gimmicks usually restricted to the pricier cabins : grab - and - go juice or water bottles always available at the galley , two full meals and a snack with three different options and a full , gratis bar stocked with @entity7 wines and unusual treats like @entity261 , the local answer to @entity263			2
even better , every passenger enjoys not just a blanket and pillow , but an amenity kit with after - dinner toothpaste and eye masks			2
@entity53 economy - class innovation : slimmed - down seats for extra legroom			2
trust @entity50 engineering -- whether it 's @entity274 or @entity56 , the aviation industry 's answer to a sports car			0
this seat manufacturer has just pioneered a simple - yet - brilliant upgrade to economy seating that creates more legroom			1
@entity53 has embraced the design , purchasing 32,000 new seats across the fleet for $ 175 million			0
the seats themselves have been thinned down ( without compromising comfort ) and the magazine pouch shifted from knee height to behind the tray table			0
the result ? stretching your legs a few more inches without stretching your wallet			0
@entity295 economy - class innovation : more comfortable seats			1
@entity295 deeded all its design needs to industrial icon @entity299 -- and he has n't forgotten about economy passengers or the little details that can make a big difference			0
on the @entity72 , seats have movable bases that recline as the back does , making for a smoother nap			0
but his canniest tweak is a new riff on the footrest			0
@entity299 strung a net from the seat like a foot hammock			2
it 's surprisingly comfy and a great prophylactic against deep vein thrombosis as it keeps circulation flowing			0
@entity320 economy - class innovation : @entity322 brackets			2
the @entity324 seat by @entity325 is an industry - wide , economy standard -- more than 200 million have been produced			1
but the @entity329 budget carrier @entity320 has snapped up a new version with an ingenious tweak : an integrated bracket so that an @entity322 can be snapped onto the back of the seat in front , creating a tv - like screen			1
passengers who do n't have their own @entity322 need n't miss out : @entity320 will soon offer an in - flight rental service for $ 8.40			2
@entity340 innovation : luxury toilets			0
@entity84 's @entity83 is the first airline to launch @entity73 's much - delayed and much - anticipated 787 , nicknamed the @entity73 ; the first delivery is expected by the end of september 2011			0
and in all classes , @entity83 is introducing select women - only bathrooms and outfitting all bathrooms with windows and the @entity84 - style bidet - toilets known as @entity350 , which offer warm , pressurized water jets for a fresher clean than one - ply paper			1
they 're common in @entity84 ( 60 percent of households use them ) and will surely make a splash internationally			0
airline to - be - determined economy - class innovation : automated flight attendants			0
developed in @entity50 , this reinvented trolley leaves the rest looking as outdated as a vcr			0
via a touchscreen , the @entity363 uses syrups , water and a carbonation pellet to produce almost three dozen different drinks , among them hot coffee , tea , juice , sodas and even beer or mixed drinks			0
( all that , plus a major eco-boost since fewer bottles and cans will be discarded			0
) it 's currently undergoing a few final design tweaks before its onboard test in the fall ; expect the @entity363 to surface in flight by spring 2012			0
