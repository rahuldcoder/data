-- i come from a family with diverse religious traditions : baptist , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and nondenominational			2
my mother was a spiritual seeker , and when she became @entity10 , i was baptized into the catholic faith as a young child			1
growing up , i attended a parish with @entity14 , @entity15 and black @entity10 , and observed that the spiritual gifts of black @entity10 were often diminished			1
when it was suggested that we include a gospel song in the liturgy , we were told that was not catholic			2
" @entity22 " was sung , but not " @entity23 had a baby , " a negro spiritual			2
i learned about @entity26 the " @entity27 , " but not @entity28			2
a @entity30 table was a no - no. i learned while the word " catholic " meant " universal " and " involving all , " much of the gifts and experience of black @entity10 were not included			1
black @entity10 have a heightened awareness of what @entity35 called " double consciousness			1
" this emerges from the tension between one 's awareness of self and how others perceive one			0
@entity35 used this term to speak of the experience of black people within the segregated @entity47			2
today , a particular form of double consciousness is experienced by black @entity10 : as a religious minority within the broader black @entity10 community , who defend our religious affiliation to our black @entity56 brothers and sisters while also confronting discrimination and ignorance from those within our own catholic churches			1
what has helped black @entity10 survive in the midst of almost insurmountable odds is a spirituality that bridges both our @entity68 - @entity67 experience and our catholic faith			1
father @entity70 , the first recognized @entity67 priest , lived a similar struggle			0
his mother escaped slavery with him and his siblings , settling in @entity75 , @entity76			0
he was baptized as a child , and by the time he was 16 , he felt " called " to the @entity10 priesthood			1
no @entity67 @entity10 seminaries accepted a black man , so in 1880 , he traveled to @entity81 , @entity82			1
he was ordained six years later , then returned to @entity47 to begin his pastoral ministry			0
after returning to @entity75 , he was invited to @entity84 , @entity76 , by the local bishop			0
he began his new ministry at @entity87 in @entity84			0
the basement of the church became the sanctuary for the emerging black @entity10 congregation , the @entity91			1
his remaining years in @entity84 were focused on ministering with and building a church for this community			0
he was a priest for only 11 years before he died from heat stroke			0
earlier this year , cardinal @entity95 of the @entity96 announced that he planned to nominate @entity97 for sainthood			0
it begins a process that will take some time to complete			0
bishop @entity101 was appointed to highlight his cause			0
in literature promoting that cause for sainthood , the bishop wrote " @entity107 grew accustomed to adversity during his short life			0
he brought hope and comfort to the dying and promises of better days for the living			0
" his model of perseverance and holiness is a testament to all @entity10 and persons of faith who are confronted with challenges			1
father @entity70 's experience resonates with many black @entity10			1
for every two steps forward -- the ordination and cause for sainthood of father @entity70 , the @entity129 of the 19th and 20th centuries -- there are two steps back , like the recent shuttering of the @entity68 - @entity67 parishes and schools in the inner cities of @entity84 , @entity137 , @entity138 , and @entity139 , @entity140 , and the struggles of black @entity10 lay ministerial leadership who strive to be accepted within the broader church			1
i have experienced the tension and the joys of being both black and @entity10 in my 25 years of ministry			1
i struggle with the fact that many of my brothers and sisters of @entity68 descent do not know this history or see themselves mirrored in the leadership within the @entity10 in the @entity47			2
it is why i went on to study and teach at a graduate school , to help my brothers and sisters understand , and see their story as a part of the @entity10			1
despite the challenges , our lives are enriched by our faith and sturdied by the example of @entity97			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dr. c. @entity168 .			2
