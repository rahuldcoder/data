in late 2007 , a social network called @entity1 started going viral at a handful of colleges			2
but unlike @entity4 , which saw a similar buzz three years earlier as a fast - spreading social network conquering one university after another , @entity1 encouraged its users to talk about each other , not themselves			1
instead of posting party photos and calls for homework help , @entity1 was a social network designed to spread gossip about your peers			1
and to get the best gossip , @entity1 let its users post anonymously			2
you can imagine where that went			0
after posts of students ' sexual exploits and even personal threats began to spread across @entity1 , some colleges attempted to block their servers from accessing the site			0
fortunately , @entity1 did n't last long and was dead by early 2009 because it could n't generate enough advertising revenue to stay afloat			0
today , there 's a new resurgence in anonymous social networks and messaging apps , which seem to be gaining traction in light of @entity36 's revelations that the @entity37 has access to just about everything we do online			1
some big - name investors are pumping millions into these startups , hoping one will be the next big thing to take off			2
there are apps such as @entity46 and @entity47 that let you send self - destructing text or photo messages			1
there 's @entity52 , which bills itself as a more private alternative to @entity54			2
and we 've all heard of @entity56			0
but two other anonymous social networks seem to have captured the attention of plugged - in techies and venture capitalists more than anything else : whisper and @entity63			1
both apps have received heavy financial backing			2
whisper recently raised a huge $ 30 million round , just months after raising $ 21 million			2
@entity63 snagged $ 8.6 million from big investors such as @entity68			1
and both apps have triggered a debate about whether or not anonymous apps that encourage the spread of gossip are good for the online community as a whole			1
by allowing users to post anonymously , these apps encourage such personal confessions as , " i have extreme feelings of rage when people around me chew or drink too loudly			0
" but they also may eventually enable hateful and defamatory gossip about people			1
there 's also concern that people will post secrets and news that are just plain wrong , but get spun into the record as gospel			0
we 're already seeing evidence of it , at least with @entity63 , which launched two months ago and has seen its share of scandalous posts			1
i can tell you that my feed alone , which comes from a network of friends in my @entity103 's address book and " friends of friends , " is full of caustic gossip about venture capitalists , sexism in tech , and a healthy amount of explicit sexual fantasies			1
in short , it 's not quite the kind of content a new startup with a fresh round of funding wants to be hosting			0
@entity63 has already taken a toll on some folks in the tech industry			1
earlier this month , there was the case of @entity123 , a former developer at @entity124 who alleged harassment by her bosses after someone on @entity63 accused her of lying about her contributions to the company			1
her tweets on the issue led to the suspension of one of @entity124 's founders , pending an investigation			0
legendary venture capitalist @entity136 , who has invested in almost every major startup in recent years , from @entity4 to the recent crop of @entity140 payment apps , caused a stir the other day when he posted several tweets saying anonymous apps are bad for society			1
" there are other systems in past & present designed to encourage negative behavior , tearing people down , making fellow souls sad , " he wrote in one tweet			0
@entity136 did n't call out @entity63 , @entity152 or any other similar apps by name , but it was clear what he was talking about and that he views such apps as havens for negativity and hate			1
to its credit , @entity63 has tried its best to tamp down the nasty posts			2
its app now shows a warning to users not to post anything defamatory or insensitive about other people			0
otherwise , @entity63 says it has the right to remove such posts			2
whisper does n't seem to have the same scandalous cloud hanging over it that @entity63 does , mostly because it has a team of human editors monitoring posts for naughty content			1
meanwhile , @entity152 's broader strategy under its newly hired editor - in - chief , @entity178 , is to encourage its users to break news			2
in fact , @entity152 has teamed with @entity183 editors to curate news and trends from its anonymous posts			0
still , it 's shaky to trust a nugget of news posted anonymously on an app used predominately by a younger audience			0
for example , @entity152 in february claimed one of its users broke a story that actress @entity194 was supposedly cheating on her husband , singer @entity195			0
@entity152 's claims were met with the appropriate skepticism , and a rep for @entity194 issued a statement saying the @entity152 post was " 100 % false			0
" ( however , she and @entity195 did announce their separation last month			0
) perhaps that taps into the essence of why @entity136 and others are n't convinced anonymous social networks can be a long - term success			1
they may rise to popularity by allowing users to say whatever they want about anyone , without any repercussions			0
but over time you risk building a network full of lies and hate .			0
