for the first time , the @entity0 is publicly accusing @entity2 and @entity3 of being the top offenders in the theft of @entity0 economic and technology information , according to an intelligence report released thursday			1
the two countries are " trying to build their economies " on @entity0 research and development , said @entity8 , the @entity10 whose office wrote the report			1
that office is responsible for mounting an integrated national counterintelligence battle against foreign intelligence threats to the @entity0 , according to its website , and must compile such a report every two years			1
an unclassified version of the report to @entity24 on @entity25 and @entity26 was released thursday and focused primarily on the exploitation of cyberspace from 2009 to 2011			0
" @entity0 private sector firms and cybersecurity specialists have reported an onslaught of computer network intrusions that have originated in @entity2 , " said the report			1
it noted that analysts could not pinpoint specific responsibility for many of the intrusions , but @entity8 said the source of the attacks could be government intelligence services , corporations or individuals			2
the report was more specific about @entity3			1
" @entity3 's intelligence services are conducting a range of activities to collect economic information and technology from @entity0 targets , " it said			1
" the nations of @entity2 and @entity3 , through their intelligence services and through their corporations , are attacking our research and development			1
that 's a serious issue , because if we build their economies on our information , i do n't think that is right , " @entity8 said at a news conference unveiling the report			1
he hoped that by pointing out the problem with the two nations , it will help spur solutions			0
the latest intelligence community assessment comes on the heels of @entity73 chairman @entity72 ' harsh criticism of what he referred to as @entity2 's " predatory campaign " of stealing @entity0 intellectual property			1
last month , @entity72 said the cyber attacks against the @entity0 had reached " an intolerable level " and were harming @entity0 national security			2
in a statement released thursday , @entity72 said the report " once again underscores the need for @entity0 's allies across @entity83 and @entity84 to join forces to pressure @entity86 to end this illegal behavior			2
" but foreign economic espionage against the @entity0 is n't limited to @entity2 and @entity3			1
the report indicates cyber attacks against @entity0 have come from dozens of other countries , but it does n't name those nations			1
the cost to both national security and private business is said to be considerable but difficult to quantify			0
@entity8 said @entity0 companies and the @entity0 government produce approximately $ 400 billion of research and development each year			1
depending on whose figures you go by , the losses each year range from $ 2 billion to as much as $ 400 billion -- estimates that @entity8 called " meaningless			2
" the report broadly states that if a hostile nation such as @entity108 or @entity109 illegally obtains @entity0 technology with military applications , it could endanger @entity0 lives			2
the @entity113 has prosecuted a number of espionage cases involving private companies , in which the economic impact was cited			0
the report gives the example of the @entity120 , where an employee downloaded proprietary paint formulas that he planned to take to a job in @entity2			2
the theft was valued at $ 20 million , representing one - eighth of @entity120 's annual profit			0
tackling the problem is n't easy			0
@entity127 , a tactical analyst for @entity128 , said private companies are often reluctant to report such attacks to the government			0
" it 's a business issue for these companies			0
if it goes public , they 've seen in the past that it could hurt them , hurt their business more and more , " said @entity134			0
he also noted the privacy issues that inevitably arise when the government is involved in cyberdefense measures			0
another difficult issue is how much information the government can provide to private industries about cyber attacks without compromising secrets			0
@entity152 , the national intelligence officer for economic issues with the @entity154 , admitted it 's a problem			0
" there are going to be limits on how much information and expertise and knowledge the government and its expertise agencies can share with the private sector , but there 's more available than there was , " said @entity152			0
a senior @entity0 intelligence official , who briefed journalists on the report on the condition of anonymity , said a public - private partnership is the key			2
" there needs to be improved threat reporting by industry , cyber and there needs to be communication back by the government to industry as to best practices and how to prevent the theft of significant economic issues , " the official said			0
the outlook is n't particularly bright			0
according to the report , @entity3 and @entity2 will continue to lead the pack in attacking @entity0 systems			1
" we judge that the governments of @entity2 and @entity3 will remain aggressive and capable collectors of sensitive @entity0 economic information and technologies , particularly in cyberspace , " it said			1
but the report also warns that changing economic and political developments around the world could lead other nations to steal @entity0 economic secrets			1
there 's also the threat of disgruntled insiders within corporations or government agencies leaking sensitive information to activists , who publicly release the information , much like the dissemination of confidential @entity210 cables on the website @entity211 .			0

@entity8 hopes the report will spark solutions
@entity2 and @entity3 are singled out as top offenders in industrial espionage report
many *cyberattacks* are coming from @entity2 , report says
other countries area also conducting foreign economic espionage against @entity0
