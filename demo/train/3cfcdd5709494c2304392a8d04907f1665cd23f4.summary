-- every few days since the start of the school year , @entity1 has posted a message on @entity5 , looking for classes around the country that might want to meet his			1
his @entity10 fifth - graders are hoping to video chat with students from all 50 states and other parts of the world			1
it 's part of the geography game , @entity18 : students gather before a computer and try to deduce each other 's locations by asking questions and consulting maps			1
by early january , @entity1 had found several teachers in other states			1
then , he received a message from a film director , asking to shoot his class during a @entity18 session			1
@entity1 was a little wary -- who sends a request like that to a public school teacher ? -- but after a flurry of @entity37 from parents and @entity40 leaders , a camera crew arrived			1
they shot students on both sides of the screen : his students at @entity46 , and a class from @entity48			2
@entity1 was delighted ; it was his class ' first foray into international @entity18 , and the video might train and inspire other teachers			1
maybe , he thought , it would show up on @entity54 some time			2
about two weeks later , he received a text message that said there were , in fact , plans for the footage			0
it would be in a commercial -- one that would air during the @entity63			1
the revelation was so short - notice , @entity1 was calling parents the morning of the big game to suggest they watch			1
until he saw it , he was n't even sure it could be real			0
but when @entity79 's one - minute " @entity80 " ad debuted , there was former @entity82 @entity81 narrating over footage of a boy romping on prosthetic legs , a woman hearing her children for the first time , a military member witnessing his baby 's birth over a computer -- and @entity1 's students , waving hello			1
weeks after the commercial aired , @entity1 still seems dumbfounded			1
" you just do n't think they 're going to come film you for a @entity63 commercial , " @entity1 laughs			1
but those couple of seconds , seen by a record - breaking @entity63 audience and more than 3.5 million so far on @entity54 , are just a sliver of what it 's like to be @entity1 's students			1
here 's a peek at the real classroom behind the commercial and the teacher at its helm : he 's willing to take risks @entity1 has been teaching for 20 years , 10 of them to fifth - graders , and was named one of the teachers of the year for 2014 in @entity108 , @entity10			1
he says he 's a risk - taker inspired by his father , a long - time educator , and his brother , a teacher of the year for nearby @entity114 in 2013			1
" i 've always been kind of an explorer , somebody that tries some different things , " @entity1 said			1
he 's been lucky to have supportive administrators , he said , but he 's also got results to back him up			2
as he 's taken more creative approaches in the classroom , test scores have risen -- and his students like it , too			2
take @entity18 : it was n't his idea , but as soon as he read about it , he knew it could hit several state standards his students needed to learn			1
there could be glitches and pitfalls , but if they 're going to learn geography , why not try it this way ? " just drilling them , that 's not always the best in my mind , as far as teaching pedagogy , " @entity1 said			1
" i wanted to expose and connect them with kids all over the @entity145			0
" each time they run the exercise , students are assigned particular jobs : among them , a " think tank " tracks maps , fact - checkers confirm what 's said , note - takers and runners make sure everyone has the information they need , and " on - camera talent " asks and answers questions			1
a student supervisor watches the whole process and looks for ways they can improve next time			2
a reporter - blogger documents the process			2
" organized chaos , " @entity1 calls it			1
he rarely appears on camera			0
the whole thing takes about 20 minutes and touches on critical thinking and problem - solving his students need , not to mention geography know - how			2
students ' questions have gotten better as they 've practiced more , and they 've actually added new rules to make it tougher : no more googling and guessing based on a city name they spotted in the other classroom			0
so far , it 's working			2
" they 'll go home and research on their own , without assigning homework or anything , " @entity1 said			2
his students just finished their 17th state , @entity187			0
as a reward for all their hard work , they 've recently earned a class pet			2
( a huge , sometimes smelly , risk , any educator will agree			0
) it 's a tan hamster			0
@entity1 's students named him @entity195			1
do n't call him a ' techie ' @entity1 can understand why teachers and schools are wary of the latest - and - greatest technology : they 've heard it all before			1
" the technology that was being provided for schools to use to help kids learn was disastrous			0
we were limited to word processing or ' @entity209 , ' " he said of his early years in education			0
" the tools available for teachers now are what i wish i would have had my first year teaching			0
" now , he 's got @entity214 ( bring your own device ) classrooms where students can use cell phones , ipods , tablets or laptops from home , as long as they 've passed a course on how to use them appropriately			0
they have access to a few school computers , and @entity1 has raised money or landed grants for big - ticket items , such as @entity232 , netbooks , a webcam and a desktop computer for the classroom			1
" i know ( my district ) would want to provide the funds , they just do n't have them , " he said			0
like a lot of teachers , he relies on free tools , too			0
he first tried using @entity18 in 2009 , when budget reductions cut back on arts education for his students			1
he connected his classroom with working artists in other parts of the country , so they could still had a chance to learn			0
last year , his students skyped with docents from @entity253 , a war of 1812 battlefield in @entity256			0
when they revealed the armory , " the kids just gasped , " he said			0
" those kinds of moments just drive me to find more learning opportunities			0
" he 's one of nearly 78,000 teachers using @entity18 in the classroom , the company reports			1
sometimes , yes , there are glitches , technical failures and lessons that do n't go as planned			0
often , he can just hop on @entity5 to ask for help , and another teacher will offer up lessons from their own experiences			2
" i take little steps to integrate technology , " @entity1 said			1
" i do n't consider myself a techie at all			0
" he sees opportunities now exploring , risk - taking -- it 's actually easier than it used to be , @entity1 said			1
as his school shifts from its former curriculum to the @entity283 standards , there 's a lot of room for creativity and experimentation in teaching , he said			0
he teaches science , writing and history , and he 'll make sure the material is covered , but he likes to give students options to show what they 've learned			1
when they studied the body 's organ systems , students could take a traditional test , or create an infographic using @entity302 software , or record a lesson for another student			0
they had to share everything they knew about , say , the nervous system			0
some students spoke for 10 minutes , and sometimes recalled facts @entity1 said even he could n't remember			2
" a lot of it aligns with how they best learn -- they learned way above and beyond , " @entity1 said			2
" they felt like they were experts			0
" he works outside his classtime , too			0
with his brother , he hosts an online talk show dedicated to education innovation , the @entity320 # @entity321			0
a couple of years ago , he created the @entity323 , a souped - up science fair that asks kids to identify problems and solve them			2
since it launched , it has expanded from his school to 10			0
one student designed a social network for charities in @entity332 to share extra resources			0
another couple of students , " great kids who always forget their glasses , " created a program that would automatically adjust computer screens so they could read , no matter what			0
" it 's all on my own			0
if you look at the innovations going on , it 's teacher - driven activities , " @entity1 said			1
" i love that there are some incredible educators out there , teachers and principals taking the lead rather than letting people outside of education define what we do			0
" i really , honestly believe we 're in a time that 's going to redefine education			1
" are you feeling optimistic about the education your children are receiving ? tell us why in the comments , on @entity5 @ @entity360 or on @entity363 's @entity362 page !			2
