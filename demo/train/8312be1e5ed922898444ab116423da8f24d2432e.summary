-- what is the @entity2 ? as the president put it wednesday , " just because we have the best hammer does not mean that every problem is a nail			1
" the @entity2 , as outlined by the president at the commencement ceremony at @entity10 , can be summarized as limiting the use of @entity13 power to defending the nation 's core interests and being smart enough to avoid the temptation to use such power when it embroils the country in costly mistakes such as the decision to invade @entity21			1
@entity22 was attempting to answer a central question : what strategic doctrine should guide @entity13 actions in a world where @entity13 's long war against core @entity28 and its @entity30 allies is winding down , at the same time that @entity32 and @entity33 are both flexing their muscles and when a number of @entity28 affiliates in countries such as @entity39 are enjoying something of a resurgence ? the president 's answer is the foreign policy equivalent of medicine 's @entity46 oath " first do no harm			1
" without directly saying so , it amounts to a cautious but firm repudiation of the decisions made by presidents such as @entity53 and @entity54 , who ordered massive commitments of @entity13 military power against perceived enemies			1
a foreign policy of judicious restraint that does n't sacrifice core @entity13 interests is not the sort of foreign policy that lends itself well to emotional rhetoric			1
but that 's exactly @entity22 's point ; it is @entity13 hubris and overreach since @entity69 in wars such as @entity71 and @entity21 that cost the nation dearly in blood and treasure , while doing little to protect @entity13 's core interests			1
but the president also said that the @entity13 reserved the right to take unilateral military action when standing up for core @entity13 interests , which he defined as " when our people are threatened , when our livelihood is at stake or when the security of our allies is in danger			1
" what does the @entity2 mean in practice ? in cases where there is no core @entity13 interest at stake , but where there are issues of concern to the global community , the president says the @entity13 should lead multilateral efforts to resolve them			1
an example of this -- which , interestingly , the president did n't cite in the speech -- was the 2011 @entity13 - led intervention to topple @entity101 dictator @entity100 to prevent him killing large numbers of his own civilians , an effort that both @entity105 and the @entity106 led			2
the @entity22 doctrine means more money for @entity109			2
while special forces occupy only a tiny percentage of the @entity13 defense budget , they are the tip of the spear when it comes to partnering with countries that have some kind of @entity28 presence and enabling local forces to go after such groups			2
at @entity10 , @entity22 announced that he would go to @entity122 to seek a new $ 5 billion fund for counterterrorism training efforts in countries in @entity126 and @entity127 , an effort that will be led by @entity109			2
this dovetails with what adm. @entity130 , commander of @entity131 , has pushed for over the past year or so -- a greater @entity109 presence in many countries around the world to partner with host nations and train them to fight @entity28 affiliates or other groups aligned with @entity28 's ideology			0
in @entity39 , the @entity2 means working with @entity142 and the @entity144 countries such as @entity145 to increase funding and other kinds of assistance to the more moderate elements of the @entity39 opposition and also to identify extremist groups better to make sure aid is getting to the right groups			2
on @entity154 , the @entity2 means continuing negotiations with the @entity154 regime to modify its nuclear program , where the president sees that " for the first time in a decade , we have a very real chance of achieving a breakthrough agreement -- one that is more effective and durable than what would be achieved through the use of force			2
" it also means closing the @entity168 prison camp since , after all , the indefinite detention of prisoners does n't fit with @entity13 ideals			2
over the past year the @entity22 administration has made some quiet progress on that front , releasing two @entity175 and three @entity177 prisoners			2
a further six of the remaining 154 prisoners in @entity168 will also soon be transferred to @entity180			0
but will the @entity2 be seen as the right strategy to guide @entity13 foreign policy for many years in the future ? to answer that question it is worth examining what strategies have guided @entity13 foreign policy since the defeat of the @entity188 almost seven decades ago			1
the holy grail of @entity13 foreign policy makers is to establish a national security strategy ( or doctrine ) that deals with the real threats that the @entity13 faces as they change over time			1
but coming up with such a strategy that actually informs effective policies is relatively rare			0
since @entity69 there have been two doctrines that could be described as more or less unalloyed successes			0
at the dawn of the @entity201 , @entity199 established the doctrine of " containment , " which attempted to block @entity205 expansionism through a combination of @entity13 political and economic efforts that included the establishment of @entity13 - led institutions such as @entity105 , the @entity210 , the @entity211 and the @entity212			1
sometimes containment also meant that the @entity13 fought proxy military conflicts with the @entity205 , such as the @entity71 , where the two superpowers backed different sides in a civil war			0
the intent of this strategy was to contain the @entity205 , and yet , at the same time , to avoid becoming embroiled in an outright war that might end with mutually assured destruction			0
containment succeeded brilliantly because ultimately the @entity205 imploded of its own internal contradictions without a shot being fired in what could have become an @entity227 - like @entity13 - @entity205 nuclear war			0
after the collapse of the @entity205 , gen. @entity228 came to be associated with the " @entity230 , " which was a response to the @entity71 debacle			0
the @entity230 was to go in at the beginning of a war with overwhelming forces to achieve clearly defined political objectives -- and then to end the conflict without getting bogged down in a lengthy occupation			0
the classic example of the @entity230 in practice was the 100 - hour war the @entity13 waged against @entity242 in 1991 , which defeated the @entity21 army that had occupied @entity21 's neighbor @entity245 , and did so with relatively few @entity13 casualties			0
following the 9/11 attacks , came the @entity53 strategy of the war on terror that was the basis for the @entity13 - led coalition 's successful overthrow of the @entity30 in @entity253			1
but after that it also became the basis for the unnecessary and costly war against the @entity21 dictator			0
as a strategy the war on terror can hardly be judged a success alongside containment or the @entity230			0
so how might history judge the @entity2 ? the doctrine will not satisfy some of @entity22 's critics , who want him to " do more " on issues such as @entity32 's intervention in @entity269			1
but it does dovetail neatly with where a large majority of @entity13 are right now			0
they have no appetite for any more land wars			0
according to a @entity0 poll in december , the 13 - year war in @entity253 has become arguably the most unpopular in @entity13 history			0
what @entity22 did in his @entity10 speech was to chart a course that balances two natural , and contradictory , @entity13 national security impulses -- isolationism and interventionism -- and points to a hybrid approach that avoids some of the pitfalls of either of these strategic approaches .			1

president @entity22 outlines his version of the @entity199 , @entity53 and @entity228 doctrines
@entity292 says it amounts to a " do no harm " view of foreign policy
it represents a **drama*tic* switch from *counterproductive* cases of @entity13 overreach , he says
@entity304 : @entity2 lacks *drama* but may be a smart way for superpower to behave
