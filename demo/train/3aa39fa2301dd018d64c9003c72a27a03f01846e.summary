-- a proposal to house federal prisoners , including some detainees from @entity5 , in a largely vacant maximum - security prison would be an economic boost to struggling northern @entity8 , state officials said sunday			1
" this is something that is very good for our state , it 's good for our economy , it 's good for public safety , " @entity8 gov. @entity9 told reporters			1
officials from the departments of defense , justice , @entity23 and the @entity24 will visit the @entity25 on monday , the officials said			1
@entity9 's office on saturday said the officials would see whether the " virtually vacant , state - of - the - art facility " in @entity30 , about 150 miles west of @entity31 , could be of use to the @entity24			1
if it is , the governor and other officials said sunday , it could provide up to 2,000 jobs and up to $ 1 billion in federal money to the area			1
and @entity39 , the @entity41 's second - ranking @entity40 , said he believes the proposal provides a " once - in - a - lifetime opportunity " for his state 's residents			1
" there are other states that want to take these jobs , " sen. @entity39 said			0
" we 've got to win this competition			0
" under the proposal , he said , federal officials have said fewer than 100 detainees from the @entity5 prison camp in @entity56 would be housed in the 1,600 - bed facility			1
they would be in a wing under the control of the @entity60 , while the @entity24 would assume responsibility for the rest of the facility			0
the @entity64 is asking other countries to house some of the @entity5 detainees when the prison is closed , said @entity39 , the @entity41 majority whip			0
but those countries are asking why @entity64 is not housing some of the inmates itself , he said , and use of the @entity30 facility would demonstrate to them that the @entity64 is willing to shoulder some of the responsibility			2
an @entity75 administration official said saturday that as part of the conversion at @entity30 , the @entity24 and @entity60 would enhance security to exceed those of the nation 's only supermax prison -- the @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84			1
no person has ever escaped from the prison			0
the @entity30 proposal , first reported saturday by the @entity88 , triggered immediate concern from critics			2
@entity64 rep. @entity91 , @entity92 , whose district covers suburban @entity31 , circulated a letter addressed to president @entity75 to @entity8 leaders saturday , opposing the possible transfer of detainees and saying that housing them in @entity30 would turn metropolitan @entity31 into " ground zero for @entity101 terrorist plots , recruitment and radicalization			1
" as home to @entity31 's @entity110 -- the nation 's tallest building -- " we should not invite @entity106 to make @entity8 its number one target , " says @entity91 , who is running for the same @entity41 seat once held by @entity75			1
@entity39 on sunday pointed to the federal maximum - security prison in @entity114 , @entity8 , which he said already houses 35 people convicted of terrorism , along with members of @entity119 drug gangs and @entity121 drug cartels -- " some of the most dangerous people in @entity64			1
" " they 're all in our prisons , and they 're all held safely , " he said			0
and " things have n't changed in @entity114 , @entity8			2
" those housed in the @entity114 penitentiary include @entity129 , who is serving a sentence of eight years and four months after pleading guilty in federal court to conspiring to provide material support to @entity106			0
the @entity30 prison was built in 2001 and sat empty for five years because the state lacked the resources to open it			2
despite being built as a maximum - security facility , it houses 144 minimum - security male inmates , according to the @entity141 web site			1
" after living in limbo for eight years , we 're open to any and all alternatives for @entity30 , " said @entity142 , @entity30 village mayor			2
he estimated that the move would cut the county 's unemployment in half			0
" i 'd never chase jobs if i thought it would jeopardize the security and safety of my neighbors and friends , " @entity142 said			2
@entity9 said that during the inspection monday , " we want to answer any and all questions that the federal authorities have			2
" the @entity75 administration has vowed to close the @entity5 facility , but acknowledges it is unlikely to happen by its self - imposed january 22 , 2010 , deadline			0
about 215 men are held there			0
they include alleged 9/11 mastermind @entity167 , who officials said friday will be transferred to @entity169 to go on trial in civilian court			0
the federal prison system houses approximately 340 inmates linked to international terrorism , including more than 200 tied to international incidents , another @entity75 official said			0
@entity0 's @entity177 contributed to this report .			0
