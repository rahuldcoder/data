-- a @entity3 - nominated classical pianist who wears personalized trainers , @entity1 is one - of - a - kind in the world of classical music			1
his expressive and flamboyant style has so far brought him more fans than critics			1
the 26 - year - old has become a sensation in the music world , with a prodigious talent that catapulted him from a childhood in northeastern @entity15 to playing to a packed @entity16 by the age of 21			1
his flamboyant playing style and bold image has divided critics , but also attracted millions -- who might normally be more into @entity23 than @entity24 -- to classical music			1
@entity1 's parents were instrumental in pushing him to be a world - famous artist			1
at the age of 9 , @entity1 gained a place at the @entity31 , moving with his father to @entity33 , where he faced some of the toughest moments in his young life			1
" the biggest challenge for me is that i was not living with my mom			2
this is really awful because ... i 've been always very close with my mom when i was a kid			2
even till today , you know , we 're still very close , " he told @entity0			2
tough times were compounded when his teacher took a dislike to him			2
far from encouraging the young pianist , she consistently told him he had no talent , and after six months kicked him out of the school			1
being so far from his mother , he found little support at the time from his father , with whom @entity1 admits to having a difficult relationship as a child			0
" when i was a kid i did n't talk to my father so much			0
i did n't know who to talk to when i 'm facing very challenging situations			0
and that was really driving me crazy , " he said			0
he experienced a harrowing moment when , in a violent outburst , his father accused him of ruining his dream of @entity1 becoming a great pianist , saying he was no good and should throw himself out of their tenement building			1
" i do n't want to become a pianist at that moment , i hate piano , i hate my father , i hate everything that brings me to being a pianist , " he said			1
" i never forgive [ my father ] for a long time , but it is like now i understand , you know he quit his job and he went to @entity33 with me			0
" he also managed to forgive his former piano teacher , and had the satisfaction of performing a master class at his former school and collecting an honorary professorship in 2006			0
it took @entity1 a long time to play the piano again in front of his father , but his love for playing returned			0
his talent and competitive spirit won him the @entity81 for young musicians at just 13			0
" i only knew that competition is the only way to become famous as a @entity15 person growing up in @entity15			1
that 's the education you get , competitions , " he said			0
it brought him wider attention and , at the age of 14 , a move to @entity93 to study at the @entity94			1
his big break came when he was 17 , appearing with the @entity96 as a last - minute replacement			2
just four years later , his solo recital at @entity16 was sold out			1
since then , the 26 - year - old has played with some of the world 's most esteemed orchestras and conductors -- @entity103 described his playing style as " like a cat with 11 fingers " -- and his youth , rich talent and flamboyant style has attracted a new audience to classical music			1
appearing at the opening ceremony of the @entity113 was a highlight among notable achievements			0
" it was really incredible when you 're playing in the middle of the stage ; it feels like you 're playing in the middle of the universe			0
you do the @entity122 in the city which has most of the feeling for you , everything : disappointment , victory , tragic moments , really sad moment , but happy moment , and satisfied			0
it 's a city that for me has everything and that what made me extremely emotional , " he said			0
wearing his heart on his sleeve , @entity1 's performances also reflect his expressive nature			0
however , not all the reviewers and critics have warmed to his style or image			1
some have nicknamed him " @entity147 , " while @entity142 pianist @entity141 dismissed @entity1 as the " @entity143 of the piano " in an article in the @entity146			2
while admitting he has created something of a brand of himself , @entity1 is happy that he gains more plaudits from his contemporaries than negative reviews , and that he 's able to help inspire others to take up music			2
an estimated 40 million children in @entity15 are learning the piano because of the " @entity1 effect			1
" while performing around 130 concerts a year , he also manages to find time in his packed schedule to be a @entity162 ambassador and work with the @entity163			2
" you need to be putting all the efforts into something you think is a priority			0
what i believe , this charity work is my priority ... i would like to give back to the world something that i get from other people , " he said .			0
