-- " everything happens for a reason , " the saying goes			0
but when the little old lady who cuts in front of you in the lottery line wins the biggest @entity10 jackpot ever , what good reason can be behind that ? @entity12 has an answer because that 's what happened to her			1
the 34 - year - old mother found out wednesday that the old woman who stepped in front of her in the lottery line at the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity22 supermarket last month bought the winning ticket for the $ 590 million jackpot			1
the jackpot winner , 84 - year - old @entity25 , thanked @entity12 in a statement read by a @entity20 lottery official wednesday			2
" while in line at @entity22 , another lottery player was kind enough to let me go ahead of them in line to purchase the winning quick - pick ticket , " @entity25 said			2
in fact , when @entity25 got to the front of the line , the ticket clerk offered @entity12 her spot back , according to a report from @entity39			1
but @entity12 refused the offer			0
@entity25 bought one computer - generated ticket that had the winning numbers : 10 , 13 , 14 , 22 and 52 with a @entity10 of 11			1
@entity25 passed up a payout spread over 30 years for a somewhat smaller one - time lump sum , pocketing $ 370.9 million before taxes , lottery officials said			1
friends later chided @entity12 that she probably let the @entity10 winner buy a ticket that should have been hers , @entity39 reported			1
why you keep playing the lottery " the joke was , that 's the lady that 's going to win it			2
i was like , ' yeah right			0
no one is going to win from little @entity19 , ' " @entity12 , of nearby @entity59 , is quoted as saying			0
so what one good reason beats out 590 million other ones ? @entity12 's 10 - year - old daughter @entity62 , who was in line with her mom at the @entity22 , found it			1
" sometimes it 's better to be patient than rich , " @entity12 said @entity62 told her			1
there 's also a lesson for lottery players here			2
if the line jockeying changed the time when the clerk would have hit the button to buy the ticket even by a split second , the numbers would have come up differently			0
" each lottery terminal has its own random number generator , and there are a lot of factors , " the @entity77 quoted @entity79 spokesman @entity78 as saying			0
" if there was even a millisecond difference in the time between key strokes at the terminal , it would have changed the numbers			0
" so when the next big payout comes up and you 're in a long line for a ticket , think about that			0
and maybe let someone have your place in line			0
