@entity0 -- a number of atheists and non-religious organizations want @entity6 's inauguration ceremony to leave out all references to @entity8 and religion			1
president - elect @entity6 will use the @entity11 @entity10 used for his inauguration			0
in a lawsuit filed tuesday in @entity0 , the plaintiffs demand that the words " so help me @entity8 " not be added to the end of the president 's oath of office			1
in addition , the lawsuit objects to plans for ministers to deliver an invocation and a benediction in which they may discuss @entity8 and religion			1
an advance copy of the lawsuit was posted online by @entity28 , a @entity29 doctor and lawyer who has filed similar and unsuccessful suits over inauguration ceremonies in 2001 and 2005			1
joining @entity28 in the suit are groups advocating religious freedom or atheism , including the @entity37 , the @entity38 and atheist groups from @entity40 ; @entity41 , @entity0 ; and @entity42			0
the new lawsuit says in part , " there can be no purpose for placing ' so help me @entity8 ' in an oath or sponsoring prayers to @entity8 , other than promoting the particular point of view that @entity8 exists			1
" @entity28 said references to @entity8 during inauguration ceremonies violate the @entity55 's ban on the establishment of religion			1
@entity28 and other plaintiffs say they want to watch the inaugural either in person or on television			0
as atheists , they contend , having to watch a ceremony with religious components will make them feel excluded and stigmatized			2
" plaintiffs are placed in the untenable position of having to choose between not watching the presidential inauguration or being forced to countenance endorsements of purely religious notions that they expressly deny , " according to the lawsuit			0
among those named in the lawsuit are chief justice of the @entity77 @entity76 , who is expected to swear in the new president ; the @entity79 ; the @entity80 on @entity81 and its chairwoman , sen. @entity82 of @entity29 ; and the @entity83 and its commander , maj. gen. @entity85 the two ministers scheduled to participate in the ceremony also are named : the rev. @entity88 and the rev. @entity89			1
the document includes a quotation from @entity88 on atheists : " i could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says , ' i do n't need @entity8			2
' " @entity28 told @entity1 that he did n't name president - elect @entity6 in the suit because in addition to participating as a government official at the ceremony , he possesses rights as an individual that allow him to express religious beliefs			0
" if he chooses to ask for @entity8 's help , i 'm not going to challenge him , " @entity28 said			2
" i think it 's unwise			0
" @entity28 said that as a member of a racial minority , @entity6 should have respect for atheists , who also are members of a minority			0
@entity28 said religious references in the inauguration ceremony send a message to non-believers			2
" the message here is , we who believe in @entity8 are the righteous , the real @entity77 , " he said			2
@entity28 said it 's unconstitutional to imply that atheists and others are not as good			0
he acknowledged that his suit is unlikely to be successful			0
" i have no doubt i 'll lose , " he said , adding that he hoped to eventually succeed through appeals and hoped future inauguration ceremonies would exclude religious references .			1
