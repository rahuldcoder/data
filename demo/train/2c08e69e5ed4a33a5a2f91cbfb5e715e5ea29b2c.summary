it 's been a long journey for @entity2 , the 15th century king whose skeleton was found under a parking lot in the @entity6 city of @entity7			1
but on friday , his final destination became clear			0
the medieval monarch will be reburied in @entity10 , just a stone 's throw away from where his remains were uncovered			1
the discovery of his remains , complete with curved spine and staved - in skull , in the summer of 2012 sparked global headlines and a new battle -- over which city would host his remains in perpetuity			2
archaeologists had been searching the site for @entity7 's long - lost @entity23 and always planned for any bodies they uncovered to be reburied at the city 's cathedral			1
that was challenged in the courts by a group calling itself the @entity30 , which argued it was the medieval king 's wish to be buried in the historic northern city of @entity34 -- the city they claim was closest to his heart			1
but judges at the @entity38 ruled friday that his funeral should be held in @entity7 as originally planned			1
their ruling notes that since @entity2 's exhumation , " passions have been roused and much ink has been spilt " as rival camps fought to stake their claim			2
now , they say , " we agree that it is time for @entity2 to be given a dignified reburial , and finally laid to rest			2
" the @entity51 , which was behind the excavation project , celebrated the outcome on @entity54			0
" @entity2 will be reinterred in @entity7			1
great news for the @entity51 , our city and everybody involved in the discovery , " it said			0
' horrific death ' in bringing its case , the @entity30 objected to the lack of consultation over where the newly - rediscovered monarch 's bones should be laid to rest , saying more thought should have been given to the question			0
on its website , the @entity30 -- made up of people who claim to be distantly related to @entity2 , and headed by @entity71 , his 16th great nephew -- set out its argument to have him reburied in @entity34			1
" we believe that the proposed location of @entity7 is wholly inappropriate for the burial of @entity2 , who had no connections with the town beyond his horrific death , bodily despoliation and appalling burial in a foreshortened grave , " it said			1
" as people who have died in a foreign place are ' brought home , ' so too @entity2 should be brought to a place with which he had every possible connection and affection			0
" @entity2 lost his life in the @entity90 in 1485 -- the last king of @entity6 to die on the battlefield and the last monarch from the @entity34			1
until his remains were found , the monarch was best known to modern @entity95 as the hunchbacked @entity97 villain accused of murdering his nephews , the " @entity100 , " to usurp the throne			0
that notorious history may make the battle over his reburial site appear all the more unlikely			0
but both sides insisted they have a strong claim to his remains			0
now @entity7 could see a significant commercial benefit , if tourists flock to see his final resting place			0
the city already has plans for a new tomb in the cathedral , where a memorial stone has long paid tribute to the last @entity30 king , and for a visitor center on the site of the @entity23 car park , telling the story of @entity2 's life , his death , and his rediscovery			2
in a statement , @entity127 mayor @entity126 said : " i am delighted that @entity10 can now proceed with its plans to give @entity2 lll a dignified reburial here in the city			1
" with the support of the city council and the @entity51 , the cathedral is now planning for the king 's reinterment to take place in the spring of next year			2
