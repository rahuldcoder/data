-- one of the @entity2 ' major donors is a named plaintiff in a class action lawsuit , seeking more than $ 5 million , over unavailability of seats at @entity7 , according to documents filed monday at a @entity10 @entity9 in @entity11			1
the @entity2 , along with team owner @entity12 , the @entity13 and corporate entities were named as defendants in the suit , along with corporate entities that manage @entity18 , where the @entity19 defeated the @entity20 31 - 25 sunday			1
about 1,250 fans with tickets were affected in the seating fiasco , which came about because certain sections of @entity18 that were being added in an effort to boost attendance were n't ready by game time			0
about 850 of the fans were relocated to other seats , and some 400 were n't , the @entity13 said			0
@entity30 of @entity31 , @entity11 , who is one of the " founders " of @entity34 who paid a minimum $ 100,000 per seat to help pay for the state - of - the - art venue 's construction , was one of the named plaintiffs in the class action			1
@entity30 and others had been assigned to " seats with obstructed views and temporary metal fold - out chairs " that " lacked any reasonable view of the stadium 's prized ' video board , ' which defendant @entity12 and the @entity2 routinely claim is one of the most unique and best features of @entity18 , " the lawsuit says			2
the lawsuit also notes that the @entity2 and the @entity13 knew that a problem with seating was unfolding in the days before the @entity53 but did not notify ticket - holders that there might be a problem			2
@entity12 and @entity13 president @entity57 on monday both apologized to fans affected by the seat shortage			0
also , the league promised to give a free ticket to next year 's @entity53 and a refund of triple the cost of the $ 800 face value of the ticket to each of the 400 fans denied seats -- or a free ticket to a future @entity53 game of the fan 's choice , plus round - trip airfare and hotel accommodations			1
fans can pick the option they want			0
not good enough , the plaintiffs say : " ( @entity78 ) his monetary sum is wholly insufficient to compensate plaintiffs for all of their expenses , including but not limited to travel costs , or of their disappointment and frustration in not being able to properly enjoy the @entity53			0
