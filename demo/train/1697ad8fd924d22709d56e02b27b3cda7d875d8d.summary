@entity2 's biggest fan former @entity3 @entity2 warms up during @entity4 on july 7			1
our first story has a fairy - tale middle and a horrible ending			1
in august of ' 77 , @entity2 of the @entity9 promised to hit a home run for terminally ill fan @entity11			1
that night , @entity2 hit two of them			1
pretty amazing , especially when you consider @entity2 only hit nine homers the whole next season			1
but that 's not why @entity11 -- a 12 - year - old from @entity18 , @entity19 -- makes this list			1
broadcasting the game nationally on @entity23 , @entity21 told the country how @entity2 had fulfilled the dying boy 's last wish			1
eyes watered , spines tingled			2
there was only one problem -- nobody had ever told the boy he was dying			2
weeks later , @entity11 passed away			2
the good luck charmers every sport has its own strange traditions			2
i 'd argue hockey 's " throwing an octopus on the ice for good luck " is the weirdest			2
tossing the eight - tentacled cephalopod was the brainchild of @entity45 storeowners @entity46			1
the date : april 15 , 1952			2
the logic : one tentacle for each of the eight victories it took to win the @entity53			2
later that spring , most likely fueled by the good luck octopus , the @entity54 won the title			2
@entity57 has objected to this practice , which continues to this day			2
the @entity60 mascot is not a @entity61 , but @entity62			2
the @entity64 guy also known as " @entity65 , " the born - again @entity65 and his @entity64 signs were fixtures at major events in the 1970s and 80s			1
he brought his message to the @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , and @entity73			2
he was outside @entity74 when @entity75 and @entity76 wed ; he went to see the @entity77 in @entity78			0
but he was more religious fanatic than sports fan			1
according to the @entity81 , @entity65 planned to assassinate president @entity82 and candidate @entity83 in 1992			1
and he 's now serving three life sentences for holding a maid hostage at a @entity86 , also in 1992			0
by the way , chapter three , verse sixteen of the @entity89 says , " for @entity91 so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life			0
" this is also printed on cups at the @entity99			0
the all - star heckler for 12 years , @entity102 lawyer and @entity104 fan @entity101 was the @entity105 's most prominent heckler			1
with season tickets behind the visiting team 's bench , his antics were legendary			0
when he reminded @entity111 of the @entity112 that " @entity114 " had rated him worst dressed coach , @entity110 had to be restrained by security			0
with the @entity116 in town , @entity101 loudly read excerpts of @entity119 , coach @entity121 's sex - laden 1975 autobiography			1
during the 1993 @entity123 - @entity116 @entity124 , @entity122 ( of the @entity123 ) flew @entity101 to @entity123 and bought him a ticket behind the @entity116 bench			1
@entity101 was ejected in the first quarter			0
the @entity104 became the @entity104 in 1997 and moved into the @entity128 the following season			0
@entity101 's new seats were not in shouting distance of the visiting team , forcing him into heckling retirement			0
last year he received 9.5 % of the vote in a losing bid for @entity136			0
@entity137 that 's right , the world 's most feared dictator is a hoops junkie			1
during a 2000 visit , then - secretary of state @entity142 presented him a basketball signed by @entity146			1
the @entity116 are the favorite team of @entity137 , who reportedly has a video library with every game @entity146 ever played			0
at 5 ' 3 " , the supreme commander of the @entity150 is roughly the same height as @entity152			0
@entity154 's @entity153 @entity154 's biggest fan was also his biggest headache			1
when she was arrested for stealing @entity159 's @entity158 in 1988 , @entity157 told police she was mrs. @entity154			0
she was a frequent trespasser on @entity159 's estate , once camping out on his tennis court			0
@entity165 's antics made her a regular monologue target			0
but the jokes stopped in 1998 , when @entity165 jumped in front of a moving train			0
the collective guilt spread when we learned she was schizophrenic , as were her two brothers , who also committed suicide			0
@entity175 from @entity176 a die - hard @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 fan , @entity177 was a frequent caller to @entity181 , @entity182 's all - sports radio station			1
@entity177 won the station 's @entity184 contest in 1994 , earning a chance to guest - host his own show			1
by 1995 , @entity175 was @entity181 's overnight guy , a title he held for almost a decade			0
in 2004 , he was deemed ready for daytime and given the 10 a.m. -1p.m			0
for all the lonely and passionate talk radio callers out there , @entity175 gives hope			1
@entity195 's biggest fanatic deranged and obsessed with seeing @entity195 return to the top of the rankings , @entity196 stabbed @entity199 during a 1993 match in one of the most disturbing incidents in sports history			0
almost as disturbing was his punishment			0
@entity196 received a two - year suspended sentence and was ordered to attend mandatory counseling			1
even more shocking , i ca n't find footage of any of this on @entity210			0
also receiving votes : @entity212 ; the fan who started the @entity215 - @entity214 brawl in 2004 ; @entity216 ; the @entity217 ; " @entity218 " from @entity219 ; @entity221 superfan - turned - bass player @entity220 ; and @entity222			1
