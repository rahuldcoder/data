my statement is as valid today as it was 20 years ago			0

but he said he decided not to press charges , with @entity15 's support , " rather than exposing the child to possible harm			2
" @entity5 's team responds @entity5 's lawyer responded in a statement e-mailed to @entity2 on monday : " it is tragic that after 20 years a story engineered by a vengeful lover resurfaces even though it was fully vetted and rejected by independent authorities			1

" he would respond " very soon , " @entity102 said			0
" at the time , a thorough investigation was conducted by court appointed independent experts , " @entity102 said			0
