-- @entity2 's ruling military junta freed democracy activist @entity3 from house arrest saturday to a throng of joyous supporters who rushed toward her house once the gates were opened			1
many tried to reach out and shake @entity3 's hand as she appeared at the fence surrounding her lakeside home in @entity14			1
someone handed her flowers , which she put in her hair in trademark fashion			1
it was a small gesture but significant in that the flowers have become a symbol of defiance in @entity2			1
" i 'm very happy to see you all again , " she said , reconnecting with the people after being hidden from the public eye for so long			0
it was difficult to hear @entity3 , her voice drowned out by the cheering crowd			1
but according to the independent @entity31 magazine , she said : " we have not seen each other for a long time			0
there are so many things to talk about			0
" she promised to address her supporters sunday at the headquarters of her @entity39 party headquarters			0
@entity3 , a @entity40 recipient in 1991 , has spent 15 of the past 21 years under house arrest for her dogged opposition to authoritarian rule in the nation formerly known as @entity2			1
recently , she had little outside human contact except for two maids and visits from her doctor			0
sometimes , she spoke to supporters over the wall of her compound			0
@entity53 president @entity52 said he admired @entity3 's courage			1
" while the @entity2 regime has gone to extraordinary lengths to isolate and silence @entity3 , she has continued her brave fight for democracy , peace , and change in @entity2 , " he said in a statement saturday			1
" she is a hero of mine and a source of inspiration for all who work to advance basic human rights in @entity2 and around the world			0
the @entity53 looks forward to the day when all of @entity2 's people are free from fear and persecution			2
" this was the third time the regime has released @entity3 from house arrest			1
the media in @entity2 , under tight state control , barely reported her release , showing only footage of her meeting with military officials			2
@entity82 , the lead singer of the rock band @entity83 whose 2001 hit song " @entity85 " was dedicated to @entity3 , expressed fears that she could be more vulnerable now but said he hoped her release would lead to constructive political dialogue			1
" ( i am ) very thrilled at the possibility this might be the beginning of some sort of rational discussion with the people of @entity2 by the military junta			0
but we 're not sure , " @entity82 , a longtime political activist , told @entity0			1
" for this to be real , there has to be progress toward real peace			2
" security has been stepped up in @entity2 , but it was unclear whether it was related to @entity3 's release or the country 's first elections in two decades that were held last sunday			1
though @entity3 has had minimal contact with the outside world , reports from her domestic lawyer indicate she is in good spirits , said @entity112 , another one of her lawyers , who is based in the @entity53			1
" i am personally delighted for her , for her family , " @entity112 said			0
but he tempered his joy with words of caution			0
" i do n't speak on her behalf as to what comes next , " @entity112 said			0
" the challenges are enormous			0
" he said it was unclear whether anything would fundamentally change in @entity2 , given the recent " sham " elections in the country			0
@entity127 , @entity128 's @entity2 specialist , said it made " perfect sense " for the regime to free her since she was no longer an electoral threat to them			2
@entity3 's opposition party won the 1990 elections by a landslide but the regime never recognized those results			1
the election sunday was the first since then but @entity3 was barred from participating because of a recent conviction			2
the ruling military junta has been slowly releasing official election results , but critics say a victory for the ruling @entity145 is all but certain			0
the government has refused to allow @entity0 and other international news organizations into the country to cover the election and its aftermath			0
it has also prevented international monitors from overseeing the vote			0
the @entity154 , which promotes human rights in @entity2 , accused the ruling junta of rigging the november 7 election			0
the group welcomed @entity3 's release but warned that it should not be interpreted as a sign that democratic reform is on the way			1
" the release of @entity3 is about public relations , not democratic reform , " said @entity163 , international coordinator at @entity154			1
" i am thrilled to see our democracy leader free at last , but the release is not part of any political process , instead it is designed to get positive publicity for the dictatorship after the blatant rigging of elections on 7th november , " @entity163 said			2
@entity3 's latest house arrest came after she was found guilty of breaching the terms of her house arrest after @entity53 @entity179 swam uninvited to house and briefly stayed there			1
the regime passed a law that made her ineligible for sunday 's elections because of that conviction			2
over the years , @entity3 has repeatedly challenged the junta and discouraged foreign investment in @entity2			1
in one incident in 1998 , soldiers prevented her from leaving @entity14			2
but @entity3 refused to turn back and was detained in her minivan for almost two weeks			2
" she is the symbol of the hope for the people of @entity2			0
if she is out today the whole country will rise up , will follow her , " said @entity193 of the @entity194			0
@entity0 's @entity196 contributed to this report .			2

new : @entity82 cheers @entity3 's release , says he hopes it *'ll* lead to political progress
thousands rushed to the fence of her @entity14 house to see her
she put her trademark flowers in her hair , a gesture of defiance
