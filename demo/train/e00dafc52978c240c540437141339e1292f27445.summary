, @entity1 would be a front - runner for valedictorian			1
she 's a class act on and off the charts , a can - do girl who shares her gifts with everyone while keeping her beyond - fabulous life -- the @entity13 on speed dial , @entity15 at the dinner table -- largely to herself			1
over the course of her three previous records , she 's matured from @entity20 - hood into a formidable solo hitmaker with two of pop music 's most transcendent chart - toppers , '' @entity25 '' and '' @entity26 , '' tucked in the pocket of her @entity29 jeans			1
so why does it feel like @entity1 is struggling so hard to prove herself on " 4 ? " the album is an every - song - for - itself welter of conflicting ambitions : it wants to be cutting - edge but familiar , accessible but artistic , hot - blooded but strictly impersonal			1
those tensions hurt most in its lumbering first half , a defiant bird flipped at anyone expecting out - of - the - box radio killers			2
instead , we get a sleepy recital of ballads , kicked off by the arid prince - ipality of '' 1 +1 '' and '' @entity46 , '' in which @entity1 pants and sweats and grunts ( except , you know , sexy - like ) , her voice climbing ever higher in search of an octave big enough to hold it			1
" i do n't know much about guns / but i , i 've been shot by you , '' she yelps on '' 1 +1 , '' as if the love bullet were actually breaking skin			2
vocally , she 's never sounded better -- throaty and precise -- but the songs here just are n't her equal			1
while those efforts at least aim high , a few of " 4 " 's lesser tracks feel like they were unsuccessfully bred in studio captivity for mass consumption			2
the familiar lite - @entity70 bombast of '' @entity71 '' proves her 2006 hit '' @entity72 '' is just that			0
'' i was here , '' co-written by @entity76 , reaches @entity78 - movie levels of schmaltz , while the promisingly named '' party , '' featuring @entity81 and @entity82 , turns out to be a slow - jam invitation to an after - work mixer with light refreshments			0
and when the 29 year old mimics @entity88 and @entity89 on the charmingly goofy one - two of '' @entity90 '' and '' @entity87 , '' she gets lost in her idols ' polyester - swathed shadows			0
unsurprisingly , @entity1 is at her best when she sounds like no one but herself			1
she takes her trusty freakum dress out of mothballs for the marching - band funk of '' countdown , '' which includes such joy - inducing non-lyrics as '' me and my boof , and my boof boof riding			2
'' on '' @entity104 ( girls ) , '' the first single off the disc , she turns cheesy postfeminism into a martial foot - stomper that crackles like a burst of pirate - radio agitpop			0
( it bombed accordingly on the mainstream charts			0
) and the terrific '' @entity112 '' seethes with off - balance harmonies , @entity120 - style " @entity116 " horns and a bionic @entity115 beat , all while @entity1 howls her eternal love to everyone and no one in particular			1
it 's exactly the kind of genre - busting risk that few other current pop stars would even attempt , let alone pull off flawlessly with a no - big - thing shrug			0
with more moments like that , " 4 " might have been an album fully worthy of her talent			0
as it is , though , even star students get the occasional @entity132 see the original article on @entity0			0

the album 's first half is full of conflicting ambitions , *resulting* in a sleepy recital of ballads
vocally , she 's never sounded better , but the songs are n't @entity1 's equal
the singer is at her best when she sounds like no one but herself , such as in " countdown "
