-- when @entity3 's cancer returned for the second time , he fell apart			2
" i had to go through a rigorous chemo and radiation therapy and a stem cell transplant , " he said			2
" i could n't concentrate			2
i was really anxious and depressed			0
all i kept thinking was : ' here i am , not even 30 , being poisoned and fighting for my life			0
' " diagnosed with severe depression , @entity3 was put on @entity10			1
" the medicine turned me into a totally different ( person ) , " he remembers , " and yet i still could n't relax			0
" are we over-diagnosing mental illness ? a year later , with the help of a yoga class for cancer survivors at his gym , @entity3 was feeling like his old self again			1
by then he had given up on the medication			0
so , when a work crisis triggered a second bout of depression and panic attacks , he had no intention of trying meds again			1
" i went back to what had worked for me the first time			0
i upped the @entity30 yoga and i channeled my energy into getting stronger and more relaxed again , " he said			1
" yoga became my saving grace			1
" @entity3 's success with yoga would not surprise dr. p. @entity36 , professor of psychiatry and medicine at @entity39			1
@entity36 is one of three authors of a recent study published in the journal frontiers in @entity43			1
" we all know the myth of yoga , " says @entity36			2
but he and his colleagues wanted to know whether there was evidence to match the hype			0
to find out , they sifted through more than 100 studies on the effects of yoga on a variety of major psychiatric disorders , including depression , schizophrenia and @entity57			1
after narrowing their field to only the highest - quality studies , the @entity39 researchers focused on 16 and found that yoga holds tangible benefits for disorders ranging from sleep complaints and adhd to schizophrenia and depression			1
evidence for yoga 's effect on eating disorders and cognition problems was either conflicting or lacking			1
scientists have cited evidence that the practice of yoga may affect the human body in ways similar to antidepressants and psychotherapy			1
one study of biomarkers , for example , found that yoga influences brain chemicals by boosting serotonin levels , lowers inflammation , reduces oxidative stress and exerts a positive influence on other key elements of the human body that play a role in mental health			1
so is it time to exchange your medications for a yoga mat ? absolutely not , says @entity36 , but he says rigorous research of this issue on a larger scale should be a national priority			1
there are some 30 to 50 million @entity98 taking psychiatric drugs , he notes			0
some are benefiting and some are not			0
in one study , funded by the @entity104 , only one - third of patients achieved remission of depressive symptoms , defined as becoming symptom - free			1
as a culture , we are becoming more and more dependent on pills , @entity36 tells me , but pills do n't prevent any of the psychiatric illnesses			0
they do n't build resilience			0
they do n't teach coping strategies and they do n't in general engender wellness			0
there are some situations when medication is essential			0
but outside - the - box strategies , such as yoga , could offer a low - cost , viable approach			1
the issue echoes a sentiment i have been hearing about with increasing frequency : recent advances in fields such as nutrition , technology and the mind - body connection are continuing to expand our definition of what constitutes mainstream " medicine			2
" drugs and surgery , yes ; but what else ? researchers , for example , recently showed for the first time that a @entity145 diet can have as powerful an effect as drugs in preventing heart attacks , strokes and deaths from cardiovascular disease in subjects at high risk of heart disease			0
other scientists are contemplating the possibility of having doctors ask their patients to download an app in lieu of taking a drug and calling them in the morning			0
alas , as tangible and compelling as the effects of these nondrug interventions may be , they often lack the deep pharma pockets required for the clinical trials that will bring doctors on board			2
when it comes to yoga , at least , @entity36 believes we should be urging our government agencies or large nonprofit agencies to take on the issue and to help establish rigorous proof for the benefit of the public			2
i try to imagine how i would feel if a psychiatrist were to prescribe me a downward dog or two instead of an antidepressant			0
but in a really good way .			0

study finds yoga holds tangible benefits for a range of disorders
regular practice could help @entity57 , schizophrenia and depression
more research is needed but yoga could be a low - cost , viable *option*
