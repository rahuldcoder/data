-- eating ethically is no easy task these days			0
one problem is deciding which ethic is more important			2
keeping third - world farmers in fair trade jobs by purchasing their produce ? or assuaging your concerns over the environmental impact of getting that produce to your kitchen by shopping locally instead ? a farmer at work in @entity14			2
the @entity15 says the food cultivation stage is the most damaging in the food chain			1
up until recently it has been the latter concern -- how food is transported -- that has hogged the limelight when it comes to looking at the role the food chain plays in climate change			1
statistics such as the fact that the average @entity28 meal travels on average 1,500 miles before it gets to the diner 's plate , have led to stronger backing for " grow locally " movements			0
but the local food movement has been greeted with dismay by the developing world -- and for good reason			2
according to the @entity38 - based @entity37 ( @entity39 ) , as many as 1.5 million people in the developing world , in particular in @entity41 , depend on the export horticulture market			0
agricultural exports , meanwhile , have been partly to thank for @entity41 's economic growth rates of around 5 per cent a year , according to the @entity38 @entity45 ( @entity45 )			0
@entity38 shoppers alone spend more than $ 2 million every single day on fruit and vegetables imported from @entity41			0
encouraging them to shop locally instead of buying imported produce from the developing world could obviously have disastrous consequences for third - world farmers			0
domestic not international food miles can leave bigger footprint doing away with food imports could be seen as understandable if international transport played a dominant role in the food chain 's greenhouse gas emissions			1
but in the @entity38 's case -- where much of the research into the " food miles " concept has taken place -- that does n't seem to be the case			0
a sturdy 85 percent of @entity38 food transport - related emissions actually derive from domestic road deliveries according to the @entity45			1
road freight traffic in the @entity38 grew by 67 percent between 1980 and 2001 , with the average journey length also increasing by 40 percent			0
by comparison , international freight contributes 11 percent of @entity38 food transport - related emissions -- that 's less than one - tenth of one percent of the @entity38 's overall emissions , the @entity45 says			1
transportation as a whole contributes 2.5 percent of the food chain 's emissions , says @entity39			1
food refrigeration , on the other hand , accounts for as much as 18 percent ( and notably 3.5 percent of the @entity38 's entire greenhouse gas emissions )			1
the whole transport issue initially came to the fore after the " food miles " concept was coined in @entity89 to illustrate how fossil fuel - intensive the global food distribution network had become			2
but the relative blame that the transport sector should be taking for this is debatable			0
in the @entity28 , up to 20 percent of the country 's fossil fuel consumption goes into the food chain , according to the @entity15 's @entity98 ( @entity98 ) , which points out that fossil fuel use by the food systems in the developed world " often rivals that of automobiles "			1
to feed an average family of four in the developed world uses up the equivalent of 930 gallons of gasoline a year -- just shy of the 1,070 gallons that same family would use up each year to power their cars			0
the average developed world diet uses 1,600 liters of fossil fuels each year , according to the @entity28 based @entity114 ( @entity114 )			0
only 256 of those liters come from transporting the food , says @entity114			0
by contrast , a whopping 496 liters goes into the chemical fertilizers used during the food growing stage , representing well over one third of the food chain 's entire fossil fuel consumption			1
food production responsible for much of greenhouse gas emissions according to the @entity98 , the food and agricultural sector is responsible for more than one third of global greenhouse gas emissions , with " by far the most important " aspect of that sector 's environmental impact , it says , lying in the initial production process -- not in transportation			1
within that initial stage , the most harmful activities are deforestation and cultivation			2
@entity139 , which clears the way for food to be grown , accounts for 18 percent of the food and agriculture sector 's emissions			1
cultivation , including " intensive livestock operations , irrigated rice paddies and application of synthetic fertilizers on cultivated land " releases enough methane and nitrous oxide to account for 13.5 percent of the sector 's greenhouse gas contribution			2
quoting the @entity38 - based @entity155 , the @entity98 says in conventional agriculture ( i.e. non-organic ) the largest amount of energy used -- 37 percent -- goes towards " synthetic pesticides and mineral fertilizers , particularly nitrogen , and to a lesser extent , phosphorous , and potassium			1
" nitrogen fertilizer in particular is extremely fossil fuel - intensive , requiring 1.5 tons of oil equivalents to make 1 ton of fertilizer			0
meat and methane : climate killers ? there is , of course , one other major source of greenhouse gas emissions in the food chain : meat			1
back in 2006 , the @entity98 revealed that rearing livestock produced more greenhouse gas emissions than the transportation sector -- 18 percent of the world 's entire greenhouse gas emissions			1
notably , livestock production generates 37 percent of human - induced methane and 65 percent of human - related nitrous oxide emissions			1
methane has 23 times the global warming potential of @entity187 ; the impact of nitrous oxide meanwhile is a staggering 296 times more powerful			0
meat and dairy represent 50 percent of " total food related impacts " , according to the @entity194			1
and in terms of the fossil fuel bill meat runs up , for that family of four who is using up 930 gallons of fossil fuel a year on food , 265 gallons of it goes towards putting meat on their table			2
going vegetarian , or vegan , therefore is being increasingly suggested as one of the best ways to slash our carbon contributions			0
a @entity212 study found , for example that meat - eaters individually emit 1.5 more tons of emissions a year than vegetarians or vegans ; and according to the @entity114 , it takes 8 times as many fossil fuels to produce animal protein than their plant equivalent			2
being vegetarian is by no means a panacea , however , as even the @entity114 concedes that eating a 2 kg box of vegetarian - friendly cereal is the equivalent of burning half a gallon of gasoline			0
but perhaps banking on everyone going vegetarian fails to take into account one simple fact : 1.4 billion people work in the global livestock sector and rely on meat - eaters for their livelihoods			1
how one would go about telling 1.4 billion people to shut up shop is anyone 's guess			0

transportation not as harmful in food chain as *previously* thought
initial production phase " by far the most important " in food chain , says @entity98
food and agricultural sector contribute over *33* percent of global emissions
meat and dairy contribute 50 percent of " food - related impacts "
