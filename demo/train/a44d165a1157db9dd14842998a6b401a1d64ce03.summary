-- i dreaded the @entity3 grand jury response for weeks			1
not simply because i knew it was likely to lead to more heartache and unrest for the black community -- my community -- but because it would most certainly dredge up deep internal conflict for me			1
i 'm raising a black boy to be a black man			1
so the grand jury 's decision seems to double down on a pattern in this country of killing black boys without care or consequences			1
but i 'm raising my black son with my black husband , who also happens to be a police officer in @entity23			1
and being the wife of an officer means i ca n't support either camp fully -- neither the outraged black community nor the justice system sworn to protect us			1
when my husband first donned his uniform nearly 10 years ago , i told him clearly and directly : " you do whatever you must to come home to me			2
" nearly a decade and three children later , he 's heeded that order , navigating the dangers that only populate my nightmares -- just to make sure he comes home			2
the irony is n't lost on me			2
i know what the research says			0
i know that this country often denies agency to @entity45 boys , and that they 're often seen as a threat just by virtue of their skin color			0
opinion : justice system unfair to minorities but in moments such as this , it 's the denial of agency to law enforcement officers that angers me			1
all cops are n't bad			2
all cops are n't racist			2
many cops have spouses and children			0
they have loved ones and friends and pets			0
they leave all this every day to place themselves in harm 's way for people they never meet			2
they want the law of the land to work as it 's supposed to			0
they do n't like to see children hurt , people taken advantage of			0
they are people doing a job that few are brave enough to take on			0
so when i heard @entity84 prosecuting attorney @entity83 describe how @entity85 allegedly lunged at officer @entity86 in his police car , i knew it was likely that my husband could have responded the same way : shoot to disable the threat			1
do what he must to make it home to us at night			0
this is part of my reality			0
it 's how i process these incidents now			0
but it was also my reality when , as we sped home to relieve our sitter one night , my husband and i were pulled over by a police officer on a dark , wooded parkway in @entity106			1
and i watched my husband , an officer for nearly 10 years , immediately turn off the car , turn on all the interior lights , place the keys on the dashboard and put his hands on the steering wheel			1
opinion : @entity3 shows failure at every level he turned to me , calmly and coolly , and said , " get our insurance card out			1
do n't make any sudden moves , and leave your hands on your lap. " i froze			0
i teared up , and fear welled up as a lump in my throat			0
because that night , before he was an officer , my husband was a black man			1
like @entity85 and @entity127 and @entity128			0
these conflicting parts of my reality are why the @entity132 state trooper shooting earlier this year is n't , to me , a black - and - white case of excessive force used by white law enforcement on an unarmed black teenager			2
and it 's why i 've not waded into the debate waters on @entity85 either			0
because i need my husband and his colleagues to make it home			0
so i ca n't " like " many of the stirring posts i scroll through on @entity143 or @entity144 or @entity145			1
i ca n't post my own rants of outrage at the failings of our justice system , nor can i post any statement that might be interpreted as in support of the @entity3 officer			1
not because i ca n't connect to them or feel them on some level , but because it 's complicated			1
and complicated in a way that no one seems to respect or acknowledge or care to understand .			0

@entity161 say her husband is a police officer and she 's raising a black boy
@entity161 says the @entity3 *verdict* dredges up deep internal conflict for her
as a police officer 's wife , she ca n't support the outraged black community or justice system
