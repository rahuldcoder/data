-- with lessons learned from previous titles and a sense of finality to the franchise , " uncharted 3 : @entity11 " exceeds expectations with a wonderful storyline , dynamic action and witty dialogue from its characters			0
the latest in the franchise from @entity13 , " @entity14 " returns to follow hero @entity15 on yet another historical adventure that promises fortune and glory but invariably involves a lot of danger			1
as in games past , @entity15 is a treasure hunter who follows clues to find lost riches in far - off lands and gets help from other characters in his missions			1
the game 's storyline follows the path of " @entity32 , " the @entity34 book that inspired the epic movie " @entity34			1
" @entity36 , the writer for the " @entity38 " series , pulls elements from @entity34 's book and weaves them into a stunning narrative about @entity15 's search for a lost city called @entity44			1
@entity45 , lead visual effects artist from @entity13 , said @entity47 really opened up the characters in the game and delves deeply into @entity15 's past as well as his connections to his companions			1
while some of the story is told in flashbacks , it never feels disjointed or out of place and flows with the action in the game			1
the pace , for the most part , is quick and occurs over several different types of environments			1
from a vast desert to historical chateaus , the scenes are beautifully rendered and help deepen the moment			0
there were a couple of missions that bogged down the story in places , but those were few and far between			2
many times , i felt like i was in an " @entity77 " movie			2
there were moments when the gameplay was very similar to what i 've seen on the big screen			0
for example , one mission had me chasing after a caravan transporting my longtime friend , @entity86 , through a narrow cavern in a scene that was reminiscent of " @entity89 " like dr. @entity90 , @entity15 has to solve puzzles and use his journal to reference solutions			1
the puzzles were not extremely challenging once the clues in the journal were deciphered			1
there are other little touches that are @entity98 , but they add to the story rather than taking away from it			1
the action is high adventure with a twist of humor and whimsy along the way			2
the dialogue helps keep the mood light as character banter flows naturally and feels like what it is -- conversations between people who do n't take themselves too seriously but have experienced life - changing events			2
there is humor , caring , concern and sarcasm that one would expect from longtime friends			0
it feels natural and gets the player emotionally involved			0
" we 've been building up to this one , " @entity45 said			0
" we went in thinking , ' how can we take our tech and art and make them even better ? ' " there are subtle effects in the environment , like shadows from a fire , ripples in water and disappearing footprints in sand			0
but the most dynamic action fills the screen during intense missions in which @entity15 takes on his enemies while the background moves			1
much of @entity15 's movement occurs along the sides and rooftops of buildings , like the " @entity148 " games			1
that motion becomes more challenging when floors and walls are also moving around			2
the game 's combat has been fine - tuned but still seemed uneven at times			1
@entity45 said the development team worked hard to eliminate some of the cover problems that were evident in previous titles			0
melee was improved ( i enjoyed getting up close and personal with my enemies ) and moving while firing is nearly mandatory			0
@entity161 has become a more effective tool in some missions			0
there was one mission , however , where i used stealth to eliminate all the bad guys and avoid raising the alarm -- only to discover two bandits guarding a door that i could not stealth kill			0
it was a little bit frustrating to work so hard on being stealthy when there was no way to avoid having to be obvious to advance			0
targeting specific areas on enemies also did n't seem to matter			0
there were times when i shot an enemy multiple times in the head before he would fall down			2
yet it would take the same number of shots to an enemy 's arm to get him to collapse			2
@entity15 can also throw back grenades that are tossed his way			1
the audio is funny , but the effects are devastating			0
a split - screen co-op version ( a fan request ) offers a unique story with the chance to unlock multiplayer bonuses and skills			1
this version can be played either on or offline			0
the multiplayer version also features improved cinematic techniques , boosters and the ability to upload great ( or not - so - great ) gameplay moments into social media platforms			2
a buddy system can be used for cooperative play in multiplayer mode , or you can go it alone during competitive play			0
" @entity14 " is an outstanding adventure game that gives you a feature - film feeling			1
the environments are open and interactive			2
the story is unique and fresh			0
and the characters are portrayed in ways that make them feel real and emotional			0
while developers would n't say if this was the final act for @entity15 , there are moments in the game that answer lingering questions from previous games			1
those are the " aha " moments that put an extra shine on a wonderful game			0
if this is the end , " @entity14 " provides a fitting conclusion with an immersive game that keeps players invested until the final treasure is obtained			1

" @entity14 " follows @entity15 on another adventure that promises fortune and glory
the game 's pace is quick and occurs over several different types of environments
its combat has been fine - tuned but still seems uneven at times
puzzles in the game are not that challenging , but they add to the story
