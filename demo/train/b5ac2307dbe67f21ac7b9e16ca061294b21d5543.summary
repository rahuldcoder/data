-- there 's a trillion dollar virus that is spreading throughout @entity3 right now			1
it 's called social networking			1
this virus , a relentless kind of digital blob , feeds on our most intimate data			1
the bigger a social network becomes , the greedier it becomes for our data and the more it invades our lives , voraciously feeding off our friendships and destroying our privacy			1
all the recent public hysteria about this virus has been concentrated on a social networking start - up called path which is accused of surreptitiously copying the address books of its @entity22 users through its mobile app. @entity23 , too , has been accused of this same invasion of our privacy , copying the addresses that we store in our smartphones with neither our permission nor knowledge			1
but this virus goes beyond path , beyond @entity23 , beyond even @entity34			1
it 's a virus that may be built into the very heart , the operating system of the trillion dollar social networking industry			1
@entity3 has even invented a law to explain this endemic virus			1
@entity41 , named after the @entity43 inventor @entity42 , states that " the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system			0
" or , more simply , networks are worth more and more the bigger they get			0
social networks have the same biology as viruses			1
if they do n't radically replicate themselves , they die			0
and the most successful and valuable social networks -- @entity23 , @entity63 , foursquare , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 --- are those which grow their membership the quickest			1
helping us " discover " friends has , thus , become the crack cocaine of every online social network			1
the bigger our personal network , the more personal data we give out , the more people with whom we connect , the more valuable the network			1
it 's not surprising , therefore , that @entity74 and @entity23 and , it is rumored , almost all of today 's dominant social networks , have been " borrowing " our address books for years through their mobile apps			1
it 's what path ceo @entity84 , in a stunning defense of his data grab , described as " industry best practice "			1
but @entity3 's dirty secret now being exposed by insiders such as the legendary blogger @entity89 and in damning new books like @entity91 ' " @entity92 and i saw what you did "			0
like @entity96 , i strongly suspect that the practice is endemic			0
take , for example , @entity62 , one of the most reputable social networks , whose ipo last may was , at the time , the largest since the @entity102 ipo			1
i 'm on @entity62 and have always been curious about the network 's " people you may know " section , a feature that has always appeared to be eerily serendipitous			0
so yesterday i ran a test			0
among the first 50 people that @entity62 suggested i might know included my best @entity121 friend from childhood , the real estate broker who sold me a house in @entity111 , a @entity113 friend and neighbor , my former @entity3 boss and the @entity117 editor of my first book			0
the uncannily accurate list crossed continents , lives , cultures and epochs			0
and i really did know 90 % of the @entity62 list			0
@entity129 , eh ? " question : how is @entity62 's suggestion list so uncannily accurate ? how does it know my most intimate friends ? " i posted on @entity23			1
@entity62 spokeswoman @entity134 had this response via email : " as with many companies that rely on algorithms to deliver relevant suggestions to its members , we don¹t share too many details for obvious reasons			0
what i can tell you is that we use a variety of data points -- including but not limited to mutual connections and profile views , among others -- to make relevant suggestions			2
" i also want to note that any data that we use is completely consistent with our privacy policy			2
" another reply came from @entity155 , a former chief scientist at @entity62 , who is now a data scientist at venture capital firm @entity157			2
" one of the things we look for in every data scientist is an 11 out of 10 in @entity162 , " he tweeted			2
@entity102 's former ceo , @entity163 said that he hoped his search engine would one day know us better than we know ourselves			0
and it seems that @entity62 's goal is to know our own network more intimately that we ourselves do			0
but the problem , of course , is that most of us do n't want our social networks to have 11 out of 10 in @entity162 that 's why the path controversy has elicited such intense debate in @entity3			1
and that 's why @entity96 , after being confronted by hundreds on irate users including the actress @entity177 , made a full public apology for his actions			0
one of the shrewdest commentators on this virus is @entity183 , the @entity185 ' @entity184 based technology columnist and blogger			2
" so many apologies , so much data mining , " he wrote at the weekend in a scathing critique of @entity3 's dismissal of privacy			2
so i emailed @entity183 and asked him how we should confront this seemingly unstoppable invasion of our privacy through the stealing of our data			2
his response was typically down - to - earth			0
" as users of these sites and apps , we have no idea the type of information we are trading for ' free ' access , " he wrote			1
" it 's one thing for a service to tell me that it plans to read my e-mails , sift through my address book , or look in my underwear drawer — then it is my responsibility to decide if i want to use the service — but it 's entirely different for these company 's to do so at will			0
" sure , i want @entity62 , @entity34 and other services to offer a better experience , but i want to know what they are doing with my personal information , this way , i can choose to enter with caution , knowing the potential consequences , or try to find an alternative service that is more transparent			0
" @entity183 is , of course , right			0
it 's not enough for sophisticated data scientists like @entity155 to boast about the intelligence of their social algorithms			1
what we need is a clear explanation of how a network like @entity62 has such uncannily accurate knowledge of so many of our most intimate friendships			2
this currently does n't exist			0
@entity62 's user agreement , for example , is almost 6,500 words and users would need an advanced law degree to make head or tail of it			0
equally important , @entity183 argues , is the need to always remind ourselves of the " information " that we are trading for " free " access on the network			1
this is a critically important point			0
social networks like @entity34 , @entity23 and @entity74 , he reminds us , are free services in which we are actually the product that these businesses are selling to advertisers			2
the only way to control the trillion dollar virus spreading through @entity3 is by standing up to it			2
either @entity84 wins or we do			0
it is us or them			0
so , as @entity183 says , we need to demand to know what @entity74 and the rest of @entity3 is doing with our personal data			2
if we do n't do this , then the digital blob will consume all this data and our privacy really will have become an artifact of history			1
follow @ ajkeen on @entity23 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity272			1

digital commentator @entity272 says social networking is a virus that feeds on intimate data
he says hysteria over apps that surreptitiously access data exposes wider problem in industry
accessing lists of our friends is the crack cocaine of the social networking industry , @entity272 argues
