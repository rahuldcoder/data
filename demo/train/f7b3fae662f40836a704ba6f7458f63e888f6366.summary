@entity0 -- more than 20,000 current and aspiring game makers have converged in @entity0 for the annual @entity3 , where the next wave of gaming trends is on display : next - generation consoles , the growth of free - to - play and independent games , and the explosion of mobile gaming			1
game publishers take advantage of the conference spotlight to showcase new games for the first time			1
@entity18 went big at the show by renting out a movie theater to debut a live gameplay demo of the upcoming military shooter " @entity22 " on a giant screen			1
other game companies rented luxury hotel rooms to offer hands - on previews of new titles across a variety of platforms			1
here are five games that stood out : ' @entity32 ' ( @entity34 / @entity33 , fall 2013 ) while @entity38 's massively multiplayer online game " @entity40 " failed to capture an audience , every @entity36 game developed by @entity33 has been a huge hit			1
after having success with @entity44 comic book characters ( a result of being owned by @entity34 ) , @entity33 has partnered with its archrival , @entity46 , to give more than 100 superheroes such as @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 the brick treatment			0
" @entity32 " offers the patented co-op gameplay and tongue - in - cheek humor that gamers have come to expect from @entity33			1
the original story will have players taking control of assorted superheroes as they explore a virtual @entity62 , battling enemies such as @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			0
' daylight ' ( @entity67 , fall 2013 ) with a name like @entity67 , you 'd assume that " daylight " is n't the first horror game from the independent game developer			1
it 's also the first horror game for @entity76 's new @entity75			1
" daylight , " which runs on @entity82 ' new @entity81 4 game engine , traps players inside a haunted insane asylum			1
armed only with the light and apps from your in - game smartphone , you must try to get out alive			1
there are no weapons other than your feet -- which are best used to run			0
every time you play this game , the horrors that await -- much like the rooms and hallways -- will be different			1
the developer has written a lot of back story about centuries of souls who were mistreated within the asylum 's walls			0
and in another twist , the game 's female protagonist is mysteriously suffering from amnesia			1
one of the most impressive things about this macabre - looking adventure is that a team of six people conjured it up and are self - publishing on @entity75			0
' @entity111 ' ( @entity112 , fall 2013 ) @entity34 ( part of @entity114 , @entity1 's parent company ) is showing its commitment to the popular free - to - play multiplayer online battle arena game genre with its second licensed game in as many years			1
with " @entity120 " already a hit , the publisher just unveiled the @entity44 - based " @entity111			0
" this game allows five players to choose a superhero or supervillain and team up to battle against another team in unique environments based on six alternate universes			1
inspired by the " @entity111 " comic books , this game 's original story has the barriers between the different dimensions of the @entity136 being torn apart			2
that opens up six variations of each character -- such as a steampunk - themed @entity140 and a bloodsucking @entity142			0
each character will have unique combat abilities and weapons			0
the game will launch with a dozen characters , including @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 , and three maps			2
@entity155 , the developer , says it will regularly expand the universe with new maps and characters			0
' @entity22 ' ( @entity18 / @entity159 , fall 2013 ) while @entity18 ' " @entity164 " failed to connect with the first - person shooter fan base last fall , the publisher 's " @entity162 " franchise remains one of its strongest			0
" @entity22 " is taking advantage of the new @entity168 engine to bring what the developer promises is the next generation of shooter games this fall			2
the @entity174 developer is n't talking about the game 's new multiplayer options , but it offered a live demo of the game 's single - player campaign on a movie theater screen			2
the game 's action will send a team of @entity186 soldiers , called the @entity187 , to photorealistic locales such as @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 as they battle a new global threat			1
the gameplay features a more @entity195 style of action , upping the ante with heavily armed ( @entity190 and @entity191 ) enemies and tense life - or - death scenarios			2
this franchise has succeeded on the strength of its wide - open multiplayer battlefields , and this version appears to offer even more open environments and freedom of exploration			0
' thief ' ( @entity209 / @entity208 , 2014 ) developer @entity208 is bringing back a classic first - person action game with " thief			1
" after successfully moving the futuristic sci - fi " @entity214 " action franchise forward with " @entity215 " last year , the studio is going back in time with the fourth installment of " thief			2
" the game is a reimagining of the stealth gaming franchise rather than merely a sequel			2
players will once again take on the role of @entity223 , a master thief , and explore a fantasy steampunk world brought to life for next - generation consoles			0
this story - driven game is n't about shooting , or even killing			2
in fact , like @entity230 ' " dishonored " last year , the entire game can be played without killing anyone			0
@entity223 uses his stealth and cunning to traverse the city 's shadows and achieve various objectives , which , of course , include stealing priceless items			0
he also has an assortment of weapons , such as specialized arrows and swords			0
the developer , which most recently worked on the multiplayer gameplay for " @entity246 , " promises this game will have mainstream appeal while offering new challenges for hard - core fans of the franchise .			0
