-- @entity1 could not believe what she was seeing			2
girls wearing almost nothing at all , suggesting all sorts of sexual acts , listed on page after page of @entity10 's escorts section			2
when she looked closer at the photos , she noticed something eerie			2
she could recognize the rooms			2
@entity1 is a meeting planner at @entity15 and @entity16 of @entity17			2
she and her co-workers work with 500 hotels around the world and visit about 50 properties annually			2
she can identify many hotel chains used in escort ads by their comforters , bathroom sinks , air conditioning units and door locks			2
sometimes , she can also identify a specific property			0
meet @entity1 , sex trafficking sleuth			1
a child protection code of conduct @entity1 has become a force in the international anti-trafficking movement , where she uses her expertise to identify the mainstream middle - end and high - end hotels used by traffickers			0
she negotiates with hotels to fight trafficking at their properties , while also trying to convince hotel general managers that it 's good business to fight trafficking through signing the @entity44 , a voluntary set of principles that businesses can adopt to fight trafficking			1
her firm has created a version of the code for meeting planners and was the first signatory a few weeks ago			0
@entity1 hopes to recruit other planners to sign on to the code			0
once @entity1 and her co-workers realized they could have an impact , " we thought this should be something all meeting planners could do , " she said			0
although anti-trafficking organizations ca n't be sure how many people are forced into commercial sex work , the @entity64 estimates that human trafficking is a $ 32 billion business worldwide , with $ 15.5 billion coming from industrialized countries			1
( that includes forced sexual and nonsexual commercial labor of adults and children			1
) an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 children are at risk of commercial sex exploitation in the @entity75 , according to @entity76 ( @entity77 ) , which created the tourism code			1
the @entity80 hotline ( 888 - 373 - 7888 ) has recorded 46,000 phone calls over the past four years requesting information , reporting tips about trafficking and connecting about 3,600 victims of sex trafficking to social services			1
( the hotline takes calls about sex or labor trafficking			1
) trafficking is n't simply sex for sale sex trafficking is n't prostitution , which is engaging in sex with someone for payment			1
the crime of sex trafficking has three parties : one person holding the victim , while using " force , fraud or coercion " to make the victim engage in sex acts for payment , and the third party paying for the sex , said @entity112 , executive director of the @entity113 , which operates the hotline with funding from the @entity75 government			1
if the victim is a child , no force , fraud or coercion is required for the sex to be a crime			2
escort ads posted online do n't obviously state that sex with children is being sold , @entity1 said , but customers who want children know to look for words like " fresh , " " candy " and " new to the game			1
" the underage victims are often runaways and victims of sexual abuse who are vulnerable to pimps promising modeling jobs , money , food and drugs			0
after a pimp and customer make a deal , usually online or over the phone , hotels are an obvious place where the sex can take place			2
" there 's privacy , a neutral place for a customer to come to , certain amount of anonymity and you do n't have to stay long term , " said @entity146 , an assistant @entity75 attorney and human trafficking coordinator for the @entity148 of @entity149 , who prosecutes these cases			1
" this can happen anywhere , but hotels are logical places where it could be found			0
" sex trafficking was n't on @entity1 's mind when she met with the @entity166 of the @entity167 to book the federation 's 2011 conference			1
that year , the nuns decided to take a stand on the issue			0
" we 've always done some type of social action [ at our conference ] , " said sister @entity173 , executive director of the federation , which encompasses the 16 congregations of @entity167 in the @entity75			1
" we like to leave the city [ we visit ] a tiny bit better than when we came			0
" the nuns told @entity183 they wanted their hotel to sign the tourism code of conduct developed by @entity77 , a worldwide network of organizations and individuals that fights commercial sex exploitation of children			1
@entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 ( which includes the @entity196 brand ) and @entity197 are all signatories to the code			0
after @entity1 's initial online research turned up hotels she recognized , she agreed to raise the issue with their potential venues			0
hotels can train to fight trafficking many hotel executives have security measures designed to fight trafficking but express concern about being publicly identified with the issue			1
an exception is @entity215 general manager @entity214			0
after learning about the problem , @entity214 got his parent company 's permission to become a pilot program			0
often , hotel executives do n't want customers to think their hotels have a prostitution or sex trafficking problem			1
( the code requires annual reporting			0
) @entity214 , who said he has n't had a case yet , did n't worry about it			0
previously on @entity0 : @entity193 chain boosts staff training to fight child prostitution " we felt it was our responsibility to get involved and fight human trafficking , " said @entity214 , whose hotel signed onto @entity77 , went through training for managers and line staff , and hosted the nuns ' conference			1
training of hotel staff is key , said @entity242 , project coordinator for @entity243			2
hotel managers may never spot the signs of sex trafficking , but housekeeping and room service employees often know something is n't right			1
they 're just not sure what			0
" hotel rooms are used as venues for exploitation , " @entity242 said			1
" a pimp might hold up one or two girls in a room and might run traffic out of a room			0
they 'll post ads on a website and send a girl to the room next door			0
" learn the signs of trafficking victims red flags to watch for : someone besides the guest rents a room , checks in without luggage and leaves the hotel			1
the child left in the room may seem confused about his or her own name ; may appear helpless , ashamed , nervous or disoriented ; may show signs of abuse such as bruising in various stages of healing ; or may have tattoos that reflect money or ownership			1
the child usually does n't have any spending money or identification ; can not make eye contact ; and wears clothes printed with slogans such as " @entity288 " or inappropriate clothes for the weather			0
sometimes , the child will come on to various men during the check - in process			0
" we 've trained them on the red flags , what to look for , " @entity214 said			1
" if they see them , they report it to their manager and we would take over from there			0
the manager can assess and go to the police if need be			0
" how to help guests can report signs of trafficking hotel guests can also keep their eyes open for those red flags , said social worker @entity312 , an @entity313 - based survivor of underage sex trafficking and an anti-trafficking activist			1
guests who see the red flags can simply call the national hotline to report their suspicions , without ever leaving their names			1
@entity312 often travels to cities with big sports events and political conventions to educate hotel and motel owners , donating thousands of bars of soap listing the hotline for victims and witnesses to trafficking			1
most of the country 's state attorneys general and many anti-trafficking activists blame @entity10 and other websites for not doing enough to fight sex trafficking			1
@entity10 's lawyer says the company takes many steps to fight the problem			0
" any adult ads that are posted are monitored in real time , 24/7 , " wrote @entity342 , legal counsel for @entity343 , which owns @entity10 , in an e-mailed statement to @entity0			0
" all nudity is banned , even for adult ads , and anyone who attempts to post an ad that 's suggestive of an underage or exploited minor is immediately reported to @entity353 [ the @entity353 ] , which is designated by the @entity354 to alert local law enforcement to rescue any child at risk in a hotel or other location			2
" unlike other websites , @entity10 does n't allow web posters to post anonymously , @entity342 wrote			0
" @entity10 charges $ 1.00 to post in personals , because it holds users accountable and provides credit card information to police so they can identify , locate , arrest and prosecute those who use common carriers to prey on children , " he wrote			2
" we continue to invest millions of dollars in human , technological , and other resources to detect and report suspected child predators and to help law enforcement apprehend and prosecute them			2
" with so much of the sex trafficking business migrating to the @entity377 , the crime still has to take place somewhere			1
" hotels can really be part of the solution , " said @entity112 , the @entity113 executive director			0
" these are crimes , these are ways that women are being mistreated , and these are forms of violence against women			0
a lot of hotels do n't want to be associated with it			0
