editor 's note : @entity2 blogs at www.evangelicaloutpost.com and writes for @entity3 , a @entity5 educational program for high school students			1
she is a graduate of @entity7 and the @entity8			0
@entity2 says @entity9 still can animate conservative popular opinion			1
( @entity11 ) -- it 's no secret that liberals throughout the nation are rejoicing at @entity9 's supposed status as leader of the @entity17			1
he 's easy to pick on			2
his rhetoric is extreme , and his personal life has at times been less than picture - perfect			0
i 've heard some pundits refer to vice president @entity25 as " the gift that keeps on giving			0
" i imagine the left feels the same way about @entity9			1
@entity9 was an integral part of my childhood			1
i must have been 6 or 7 when i started listening in the late 1980s			2
i remember that my parents and their friends found him refreshing , and i remember that he made them laugh			0
i memorized his song parodies and even tried to write a few of my own based on the events i heard him talk about			0
when i was 11 , i once spent several hours trying to call his show , redialing after every busy signal , over and over			0
it 's probably just as well ; i think i had planned to try to talk him into running for president			2
i no longer think he 'd make a good president -- we 're all much better off when he sits behind the @entity47 microphone			0
@entity9 taught me a lot about personal responsibility , the value of freedom of speech and the love of country			1
at 26 , i 've outgrown many of my childhood habits , but i never outgrew @entity9			1
have conservatives outgrown him ? is it time to distance ourselves by dismissing him as just " an entertainer , " as @entity62 chairman @entity61 initially did before apologizing ? my friend @entity63 wrote recently that @entity9 is " a shallow thinker " who will alienate today 's young adults rather than draw them in			1
he argued that @entity9 's " insider lingo " and harsh demeanor are problematic at a time when the @entity17 is losing the young adult vote			1
is he right ? has @entity9 outlived his usefulness to the conservative movement ? should we take a cue from the @entity76 ' glee and relegate @entity9 to a back room like an aging and unpopular distant relative ? not by a long shot			1
@entity9 does n't need to be removed as leader of the @entity17 , because he 's never held that position , much as @entity76 would like you to think he has			1
he 's a vitally necessary part of the conservative movement , but he 's no one 's leader			2
do n't give him more credit than he deserves , and do n't fall prey to the @entity76 ' carefully planned attempts to inflate his authority			0
@entity61 learned the hard way a few days ago that the opposite extreme is also not true -- @entity9 is not a mere entertainer			1
one of his most important contributions to the conservative movement has been his ability to energize the base			0
this is particularly vital now given the recent election results			0
someone has to keep the troops from giving up , and like it or not , for now that someone is @entity9			1
it does n't really matter whether he 's a shallow thinker			0
what does matter is that he knows how to prod people into action			0
that 's all well and good , but is it sustainable ? what works for me and for the many other " @entity114 babies " out there may not work for our younger siblings			0
thanks to the @entity121 campaign , new activists are n't going to be as easily attracted by witty aphorisms and wordplays as previous demographics were			2
president @entity121 's impressive rhetorical skills appeared to raise the level of public discourse during the campaign			1
as far as i can tell he did n't actually say anything new , but so many things sounded new when he said them			0
i do n't think he changed the content of the age - old feud between right and left , but he did change the style , providing a stark contrast to the admittedly strident tones of some on the right			0
that 's going to change the way young people all over will approach the political process ; after all , 66 percent of the 29 - and - under crowd voted for @entity121			1
@entity9 's personal influence will decline because of this shift in rhetorical style , but we 're not yet at the point where it is unimportant			1
the current crop of college students may not call themselves " dittoheads , " but their mentors and heroes within the movement still do , and that will continue to be significant for a while yet			0
do we need leaders who can inspire the next generation of young conservatives ? absolutely			2
is @entity9 the best man for that job ? at this point , yes , though that will probably change in the next few years			2
one thing is likely -- the next big conservative leaders who do resonate well with the age group that favors @entity121 will cite @entity9 as a major influence			1
his work wo n't end with him			0
and that 's as it should be			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 says she grew up listening to @entity9 and became a big *fan*
she says @entity9 's style still has great appeal to conservatives
@entity2 : @entity121 has set a new bar for public discourse , *winning* over young voters
@entity9 may not appeal to the young as much , but he 's still *relevant* , @entity2 says
