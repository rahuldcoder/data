-- while most consumer goods companies are seeking opportunities in @entity4 , domestic condom maker @entity1 is going in the opposite direction -- seeking @entity7 partners or acquisitions as part of a bid to go global			1
the company , majority - owned by its founder , has grown rapidly in its short life			1
it will sell 200m condoms this year , all within @entity4 , and is targeting sales of 1bn next year ; the same number that @entity17 , the world 's biggest player , was producing in the country within three years			1
@entity21 , chief executive , was in the @entity22 last week " meeting potential partners and acquisitions "			0
funding for any deal will either come from existing shareholders , bank loans or possibly through an overseas stock market listing , he said			0
despite the size of the market on its own doorstep -- and added attraction of a government - mandated one - child policy -- @entity1 sees its future on the international stage			1
it reckons its virus - proof latex condoms will enable it to compete alongside the global players such as @entity17 , now part of @entity41 , and @entity42 of @entity43			1
however , mr @entity21 said that the strength of his company -- whose range includes beautiful girl , @entity48 and @entity49 -- was in manufacturing and technology , and going global required bringing in branding and marketing expertise			1
sales outlets and channels are also likely to vary from @entity4 , where half of all condoms are bought by women			2
" we think we have good leading edge technology and a good management team			0
what we lack is the branding part : we are not well known , " mr @entity21 said			0
according to @entity66 , the data publishers , the global condom market is set to hit 27bn units , worth $ 6bn , by 2015 , driven by demand from emerging economies including @entity4 and @entity70			1
@entity1 plans to start selling in @entity71 and countries in @entity70 shortly			2
but in @entity4 , as with other consumer goods ranging from cars to handbags , the stress is on bling			2
at the opulent @entity80 casino in @entity81 , @entity1 sells single condoms for hk $ 50 ( us $ 6 ) a throw and , according to mr @entity21 , designer condoms ( presumably fake ) are available online at us $ 65 apiece			0
so far , roughly one - quarter of the group 's sales have been to the government , which distributes them free of charge , but that proportion is expected to shrink			0
" in the old days free condoms were welcomed by the people , " said @entity92 , director of international sales			0
" but now people can afford to pay and will go to the pharmacy to buy the best , most fancy ones			0

@entity4 condom maker @entity1 is looking to go global , aiming at *industry* giant @entity17
the company , majority - owned by its founder , has grown rapidly in its short life
