-- step aside , @entity1			2
according to its creator , @entity3 chocolate is not just chocolate , it 's " an experiential chocolate story - telling vehicle that 's meant to be indulgent and sensual and opening to the mind			1
" more than that , 38 - year - old company founder @entity9 intends to " break down stereotypes through chocolate			1
" having traveled around the world , @entity9 's goal is to get people to try the exotic flavors she discovered , something that 's more achievable if those flavors are enrobed in chocolate			1
among her best - selling items is a truffle collection that includes sweet @entity24 paprika and @entity26 star anise , fennel and pastis confections			1
while chocolate with once - unusual ingredients like chilli or sea salt is now increasingly commonplace , when @entity9 first tried selling her product to department store @entity35 in @entity36 in 1998 , she recalls " the guy looking at me like i 'm crazy when i 'm telling him what 's in it			1
" but today , @entity9 's product sells through 2,000 outlets worldwide , and in eight dedicated boutiques			1
last year , her business made $ 30 million , up 50 % on the previous year			2
this year , she has brought the @entity3 experience to a mass market , launching a new , less expensive brand that will sell in places like @entity48 and @entity49			1
where a box of 16 @entity52 truffles costs $ 40 , a 2oz bar of @entity55 , which features flavors such as beef jerky and bbq potato chips , is $ 3.99			1
more from leading women : the woman hunting the @entity61 a @entity63 chemistry and psychology major , @entity9 moved to @entity65 upon graduating , to study cuisine and patisserie			1
on the advice of renowned chef @entity69 , who ran what was regularly described as the world 's greatest restaurant , @entity73 , in @entity74 , @entity9 toured @entity75 and @entity76			1
in keeping with her international perspective , @entity9 plans to devote her next few years to cultivating cacao in @entity79 , and opening a lodge in @entity81 where tourists can learn about chocolate making			1
here , she tells @entity0 about how she came up with her winning concept			2
on her first chocolate epiphany ... i had my first chocolate experience in the @entity52 ( in @entity65 )			1
i went to this restaurant called @entity90 and they had taken chocolate ganache ( which is like the center of the truffle ) , they froze it and dipped it in a beignet batter and fried it			1
that experience of eating this donut - crusty exterior and , when you bit down , this molten explosion of chocolate ... that started piquing my curiosity about chocolate			1
on her second chocolate epiphany ... it was n't until i got back from my trip and moved to @entity110 to get a job with my uncle that i realized there was no innovation going on in chocolate			1
he wanted me to find chocolate for his catalog business , and ( everything ) was just loaded with sugars and artificial flavorings and extracts and wax , and there was no story			1
i had all these spices from my travels , and this necklace from the @entity130 tribes in @entity131			2
( they told me it was made out of shells , turns out it was all tigers ' teeth )			0
there was a lot of struggle over territory and missionaries tried to get them into new religions , and i was just like " we should n't kill culture like that			0
" i went into my kitchen that night and made a curry and coconut truffle			2
i decided to pay homage to the naga people and call it @entity130			0
everything made sense in that moment : there was this illuminated path that said " just use chocolate as a medium to tell stories			2
" i ended up working on 20 different flavor profiles that night -- saffron with white chocolate and sugar crystals to represent @entity165 's mosaic work , a @entity24 paprika and chocolate ginger -- all based on my travel experiences			1
the next day i went into work and brought this collection of chocolates			0
@entity110 in 1997 was still very much a bbq town , and these people were like " i am not trying that curry thing			2
" i got one woman to try it			0
she took a bite and her face went from disgust and worry to awe and surprise to " @entity183 , this is actually good			0
" she was like " let me try wasabi			2
" she was totally open to try whatever , and it was really , really cool to see that			0
on how to succeed ... i think it 's really important for women to have confidence in her individuality and not try to conform to being someone she thinks she needs to be , to compete in the legal world or in the corporate world			2
it 's so important to find your own voice			0
people respect it so much			0
people are very attracted to people who are passionate in their own way , that are respectful , but that are smart and speak their mind			0
you have this guiding light within yourself			0
always go to that as your sounding board and your voice of truth			0
follow that instinctual space in your solar plexus -- you know , that place that says what you need to do is right or wrong			0
following that gut instinct is so critical			0
you have to have your little niche and carve it out and then follow it with all your heart and success will come to you			0
on her management style ... i 've been told i can be a little " big picture " for some people , because i think things can get done very quickly and i want them done very quickly			0
i do n't rely on other people 's opinions or consumer research to make new products , which is somewhat unusual ... i do n't always follow processes			0
i skip steps , and i always make last - minute changes -- and usually that 's the right thing to do .			0
