that 's the name of a lawsuit the @entity6 senator announced wednesday against president @entity0 and national security officials over government surveillance			1
" we do n't do this out of disrespect to anyone we do this out of respect to the @entity16 , " @entity2 said at a news conference			2
@entity2 's class - action suit , filed in federal court in @entity19 , was spurred by @entity21 's public disclosure last year that the @entity22 had gathered information on nearly every telephone call made in the @entity25 since 2006			1
at a news conference , @entity2 called the legal challenge " an important first step " to ending the program that sweeps up numbers and other information known as metadata			2
with the suit , the son of @entity35 hero @entity34 , who captured the hearts and minds of millions during his two presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012 , is rounding out his political persona through his @entity35 roots and adding another spoonful of political savvy			2
paul v candidate x @entity45 in 2014 could be an effective way of helping @entity2 v the @entity48 candidate in 2016 , if he runs for president			1
read the suit it 's no secret that @entity2 is considering such a step , but nothing 's official yet			1
" i keep looking at my schedule and i see @entity56 , i see @entity57 , i see @entity58 and i do n't understand why i keep going to these states			0
" @entity2 said sunday about the three key nominating states on @entity62 tv station @entity61 's program " @entity65 , " according to the @entity64			2

asking for email addresses of class - action participants could be an effective way to increase a list of campaign supporters			1
" senator @entity2 can tap into those that are angry at the @entity22 and use the large number of class action participants to fundraise for a potential 2016 presidential run , " @entity100 strategist @entity99 said			1
in a @entity107 op - ed , @entity2 stayed away from politics and stuck to the policy prescription			0
" it 's time to hold government officials accountable for their habitual trampling on the @entity16 and on our rights as individuals , " he wrote			0
opinion : stop the @entity22 while we still can crossover appeal while @entity2 's criticism of the government 's surveillance programs has rankled both @entity48 and @entity100 who believe the program keeps @entity25 safe , he is also receiving bipartisan support			1
@entity125 , co-founder of @entity126 , said @entity2 's suit follows his principles of limited government			1
" i think it first and foremost is practical and necessary that we define the role of the @entity22 in terms of the @entity135 in terms of today 's modern technology , " @entity130 said , praising @entity2			0
on the other end of the political spectrum , the @entity138 said it generally agrees with @entity2 's efforts to rein in the program			0
" we agree with his view of the program and hope it will bring an end " to the surveillance program , @entity143 , an @entity138 staff attorney , said			0
the @entity138 also filed its own lawsuit six months ago against the program and hosted a day of action on tuesday that resulted in 266,000 calls and emails to members of @entity153 opposing the mass surveillance program created to boost @entity25 counterterror abilities			1
@entity2 gained national attention during a 13 - hour filibuster last year of @entity158 , the nominee to lead the @entity159 when he also received praise from both conservatives and liberals			0
and after he announced his suit wednesday , @entity2 had lunch to discuss restoring voting rights to ex felons , an issue that @entity2 has also drawn attention to and also crosses political ideologies			1
hurdles the efficacy of the suit is challenging , said legal analyst @entity173			0
" it 's a serious legal issue , " @entity173 said on @entity107 's " @entity174 , " adding that the issue will likely reach the @entity176 but not via @entity2 's suit because of it 's difficult to show that people were harmed by the surveillance			1
