@entity0 -- @entity2 will release another album featuring new material , his long - time producer @entity5 has told @entity1 , in a revelation that will delight the singer 's legions of fans			1
@entity2 last year released " @entity14 , " his first new music for a decade , without any warning , electrifying music lovers who assumed the reclusive legend had retired			1
critical acclaim for the album was followed by rave reviews for the " @entity18 " retrospective exhibition at @entity0 's @entity20 , which is now touring the world			2
and earlier this month the 67 - year - old star announced that a career - spanning greatest hits package due out before @entity24 would feature one new song , called " @entity26 ( or in a @entity27 )			2
" @entity5 , who produced the " @entity14 " and the forthcoming single , said a further collection of original music would be released			1
" there 's gon na be another album , definitely			0
i think he talked about , although actually he did n't really say anything			0
he 's announcing , he announced to his fans recently that there 's gon na be more music soon			0
that obviously means another album , " the producer said -- although he did n't say when the new music would be released			1
@entity5 played down any suggestion that @entity2 might tour the new material			1
" i do n't think he 's gon na busk in the tube ... on the @entity46			0
as far as a concert is concerned i have no idea			0
" he clearly did n't promote ' @entity14 ' with a concert and whether he does for the next one i do n't know and i could n't predict that -- it 's up to him			2
it 's whatever takes his fancy			0
" in the meantime a performance by @entity5 and drummer @entity56 , the last surviving member of @entity2 's famous @entity57 from @entity59 backing band during his @entity61 breakthrough years , is as close as fans will get to experiencing @entity2 's music live			1
the pair will perform @entity2 's 1970 album " @entity67 " in @entity0 , @entity68 and @entity69 , starting on monday			2
@entity71 's @entity70 takes on the task of replacing @entity2 's vocals on the songs that helped to launch a unique musical talent			2
the announcement effectively quashes fears that " @entity14 " would be @entity2 's swansong , and he said he hoped to continue to work with the @entity0 - born singer , whose work has spanned almost five decades			1
@entity5 also rubbished suggestions that @entity2 , who had heart surgery in 2004 , was unwell			1
" i saw him in the 10 - year period when we did n't work together and he was really happy about taking a break			0
he was in fine health			0
" there were all kinds of rumors flying around and he was n't upset that people thought he was in ill health ... he said , ' nah i 'm just not inspired and i 'll wait till i feel it			0
