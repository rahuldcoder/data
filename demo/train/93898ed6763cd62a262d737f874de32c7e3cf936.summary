-- a bare - chested man bursts athletically across the floor , flipping sideways , striking out a fierce kick , high above the heads of the screaming crowd			0
his rival hits back -- sliding across the space with a seamless stream of backflips , jump kicks , and aerial rotations , teetering on the corner of the mat , stretching backwards to recover his balance			0

the shirtless man explodes forward once more , from standing , shooting agressively into the air with final , winning flip			0
this is " tricking " -- a lightning - fast mix of martial arts , gymnastics and breakdancing that has spent 20 years quietly spreading across gymnasium floors and internet video sites , but is now set to burst out			1
read this : the street kid who grew into a ' @entity33 ' in the burgeoning world of tricking , 23 - year - old @entity35 is the new hero , the bare - chested , high - kicking victor in the @entity17 battle , and champion of tricking 's first international " throwdown " tournament on 24 august			1
meet the tricker @entity35 says it all started when he was a child , in @entity43 , @entity44			1
he sat watching wide - eyed as @entity45 and the @entity46 blazed across the tv screen with superheroic stunts and frenzied action sequences			2
" as a kid you think ' wow , i want to do that ! ' " he says			0
when he first heard of tricking it was little more than a hobby for likeminded teens with a fondness for impressive acrobatics			2
@entity35 had spent much of his youth studying dance and teaching himself to do gymnastic tumbling moves before taking martial arts lessons aged 16 -- ultimately earning a first degree black belt in taekwondo			1
through taekwondo he met the " trickers , " a loose collection martial artists who congregated after karate competitions in dojos or on sprung - floor gym mats to show their most impressive jump kicks			2
in stark contrast to the restrictive worlds of professional dance and rhythmic gymnastics , @entity35 found tricking to be fast and free			1
he and his fellow trickers showcased their own distinctive styles and gradually absorbed techniques from hip - hop dancing , capoeira , cheerleading and free - running -- and anywhere else their creative interests took them			0
read this : @entity88 's mind - bending contortionists " now i grab inspiration from just about anything , " says @entity35			1
" i 'll watch gymnastics , i 'll watch martial arts movies or competitions , i 'll watch dancing , even drawing and art and other artistic forms of expression			1
" i pick up moves from action sports like skateboarding or bmx or motocross , and i 'll start to break it down and change it into something i can do , on gymfloor or on grass , and put it in a different format for tricking			1
" the new champion of the @entity111 in august , competitors from across the world assembled in @entity17 's @entity115 venue for tricking 's inaugural throwdown competition , arriving from as far away as @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 to meet the top athletes from the @entity121			1
rules were drawn up to pit teams of three against three , or individuals in one - on - one bouts , giving trickers just 90 seconds to show off their skills			0
in full flow , tricking contests mirror breakdancing battles : turn - based competitions where athletes fire off runs in quick succession in a bid to impress the judges			2
arriving as a wildcard -- only being invited to compete after another contestant was forced to pull out -- @entity35 went head - to - head with highly regarded athletes at the competition			1
over four battles , the judges scored him highest across the five criteria they assess -- including kicking technique and trick difficulty -- and he stole the individual title			0
@entity35 believes the key to his success is his explosive technique , which sees him boosting his 5 ' 6 " frame incredible heights into the air to throw breathtaking moves			1
the @entity111 's sports organizer @entity154 explains that @entity35 ' full - throttle style reflects the distinctive quality that sets tricking apart from more smoothly orchestrated gymnastic events			1
" watching a trick battle is like watching fireworks , " he says			0
" these guys are going up in the air and the things they 're doing are so explosive and powerful			0
" i think the explosiveness of tricking is really what makes it so exciting			2
that and the competitors feeding off each other and trying to step each other up -- saying ' oh that 's a great move , but watch this ! " and doing something even bigger			2
" going big @entity35 says the sport " clicked " for him last year , and since then he 's learned to use his movement across the gymfloor to express his own personality : " for me , it 's my way of taking everything that i feel ... and putting it into a physical form			1
" at the same time , tricking has reached maturity as a sport			1
@entity154 -- a veteran tricker in his own right , who has been competing since tricking 's early days in sport karate tournaments -- says the incredible growth in popularity owes a lot to @entity188 , where videos of popular trickers have accumulated hundred of thousands of views			1
there is now a calendar full of meet - ups and open gyms where newcomers are encouraged to get involved and experience tricking firsthand			2
top trickers are turning up in increasingly high - profile places , recently showing off their skills in movies , music videos , and at the @entity204 and @entity203			0
for @entity154 the progress that the sport is making is " incredible			0
" " i 've been in the sport about 20 years , and every year it just gets better and better and more and more crazy , " he says			0
" i mean , these guys are really pushing the limits			0
the level that we had last year compared to this year is completely night and day			0
