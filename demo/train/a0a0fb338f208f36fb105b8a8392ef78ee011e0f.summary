-- @entity1 has enjoyed a reputation as one of @entity5 's most stable nations since achieving independence from the @entity7 in 1963			0
residents of the @entity10 slum in @entity11 shout at demonstrators during violent clashes			0
but a booming tourism industry , impressive economic growth -- currently six percent a year according to @entity16 -- and decades of peace in a region scarred by conflict have served to disguise widespread poverty , violent crime and corruption and simmering ethnic tensions			1
tribal bonds remain stronger than national identity in @entity1 , with the country 's 36 million people claiming allegiance to around 40 different tribes			1
last week 's election pitched incumbent president @entity31 , a member of @entity1 's largest @entity33 tribe , against opposition leader @entity34 of the @entity36 tribe			1

this week 's violence came as election officials declared victory for @entity31 with 51.3 percent to 48.7 percent for @entity34 in the closest presidential vote in @entity1 electoral history			2
but the result has been questioned by international election observers , throwing the country 's political future into doubt			0
