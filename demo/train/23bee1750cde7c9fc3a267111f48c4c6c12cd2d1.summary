@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 prime minister @entity3 resigned wednesday in a televised speech to his debt - ridden nation after parliament rejected his government 's austerity plan intended to ease the financial crisis			1
opposition parties combined to vote down the plan , which they viewed as hurting @entity4 's poor , that had been formulated without broad consensus			1
@entity3 , a @entity14 , had threatened to resign if the plan failed			2
he gave his resignation to the @entity4 president , @entity17			1
the presidential website indicated it was not clear there would be snap elections			0
another option , the website indicated , would be for a replacement to be appointed without elections			0
@entity3 said the country is the real loser in the decision			0
" the obstruction from the opposition today was taken to intolerable levels			0
" @entity3 said in his address			0
" it was n't just about obstructing the government , it was about obstructing the country			0
" the defeated plan was the latest in a series of austerity measures aimed at resolving @entity4 's financial crisis			1
where previous plans had increased the country 's value added tax to 23 percent and cut salaries of government workers by an average of 5 percent , the latest proposal included budget cuts and a freeze on pensions			0
critics said the plan would unfairly hurt low - income residents already struggling under higher taxes			1
@entity54 , a member of parliament who voted against the proposal , said all of @entity3 ' plans have failed and the country needs change			2
he said the government 's policies have increased poverty			0
but @entity62 , a lawmaker who supported the plan , said in debate over the proposal that rejecting the plan could throw the country into turmoil			1
" the responsibility belongs to whom wanted to add a political crisis to our existent economic crisis , " @entity67 said			2
the political turmoil comes on the eve of @entity76 summit in @entity77 that had been expected to focus on the debt crisis in the eurozone but which will now likely include additional attention on @entity4			1
@entity4 's high debt and borrowing costs have prompted repeated speculation in the @entity76 and in international financial markets that the nation might need a bailout , like @entity87 and @entity88 before it			1
@entity3 ' socialists hold 97 seats in the 230 - seat parliament			2
a spokesman for the main opposition center - right @entity93 , with 81 seats , said his party was rejecting the government 's plan because " we are trying to save the country , not the prime minister			1

the question for many is how @entity4 's delicate financial situation , with 10 percent unemployment and tepid economic growth , will fare under a caretaker government			1
a top @entity109 official , @entity108 , told @entity2 that @entity3 will go to @entity77 on thursday for the @entity76 summit			0
@entity3 ' resignation will not have much " impact on the @entity4 economy , " financial analyst @entity111 told @entity2 before the vote			1

but @entity108 said the opposition had distorted the plan 's contents			2
he said the pension cuts it envisioned would have hit some of the wealthiest @entity4 , not the poorest			2
