-- @entity2 's industrial sector is known for its efficiency			1
its automotive industry is among the most successful in @entity6 , and stands as the third largest in the world			1
but with an aging population , the country is struggling to meet the demand for a skilled workforce which can continue to propel manufacturing forward			1
cue the " @entity12 " , a 17,000 square foot innovation hub in the city of @entity15 where researchers experiment with new technologies and machinery in a bid to improve the production process			2
developed by scientists at @entity23 and @entity24 in @entity25 , the factory is particularly committed to rethinking the role of humans in manufacturing lines			1
" the processes we are developing today are so much more complex , " says professor @entity29 , director of the institute			0
" the machines and resources are so much more sophisticated that we will need qualified people to handle these processes in the future , " he adds			0
virtual training to ensure future workers are fully prepared , the lab has created a state of the art virtual environment where potential employees can test out the new technologies and intelligent systems that are set to form the building blocks of @entity2 industry			2
