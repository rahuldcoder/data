-- intense black smoke billowing from the flames of an oil fire blocks out the sun. a teenage mom with a one - day - old baby seeks shelter in a dimly - lit basement from a barrage of missiles and shells			0
incoming fire smashes through the wall of a house being used as an unofficial media center in @entity16 , the city that is the focus of anti-regime protests and @entity20 efforts to silence them			1
the horror of enduring the all - out assault by the @entity20 military is brought vividly to life in a @entity0 documentary airing this weekend			1
with the help of local activists , a @entity0 crew was smuggled into @entity16 , moving from house to house as the @entity20 army fired missiles and tank shells			1
for more than a year president @entity36 's military had used brutal force to put down the uprising			1
across @entity20 , protesters demanded change -- chanting " down with the regime " but it was @entity16 -- and especially the neighborhood of @entity16 -- that became the epicenter			1
even @entity0 correspondent @entity45 , with her vast experience of reporting from war zones , had reservations about the high - risk job			1
she said : " i actually wrote a letter home the first time , to my family			2
and i went to see some very close friends as well , just in case			0
" she was joined by @entity54 , a veteran cameraman who has worked in @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , and @entity59 , a former special forces officer to handle security and who would also become an unofficial stills photographer			0
just getting into @entity16 was an ordeal that took five days for what would normally be a two - hour drive			1
@entity66 said : " it involves a fairly elaborate process of being moved through farmlands , back roads , trying to avoid the government , ending up in various safe houses			0
and at every single leg , every single stop , you have a different person who 's responsible to move you on to the next one , someone who knows the details of the lay of the land around you to ensure that they can actually get you through from one point to another			0
" for the thousands trapped in @entity16 , the route was their only lifeline and @entity0 agreed to keep it secret			1
in @entity16 , there was no frontline meaning there was also nowhere that could be called safe			1
@entity66 said : " it [ seems ] mostly deserted , most of the buildings have sustained some sort of damage			0
and then you 'll see a kid peek their head out from a doorway , or you 'll see a man walking in the street carrying an @entity102 " some of the most constant fire has been on @entity16 where people are killed or wounded daily , and where two doctors -- and one of those was a dentist -- are fighting against the odds to help the casualties			1
in a makeshift clinic there was a man with head injuries from shrapnel , another whose leg injury was most likely going to lead to an amputation			0
the medics say the @entity20 military regards the clinic as a target so they have set up in numerous temporary houses around @entity16 , each with patients and with the doctors moving between them			1
but snipers posted on rooftops above the rubble - littered streets made even the shortest of trips treacherous			1
mosques put out messages before the bombardment started , telling people to not live on the upper floors , to try to stay away from windows , and to try to find protective rooms , inside their homes			0
in basements used as bunkers , civilians pray the next bomb will miss their home and their loved ones			2
in one of these bunkers , the @entity0 crew met a teenager who had given birth the day before			1
her daughter @entity149 was the face of innocence amid the hell of @entity16			2
her father does not know she 's been born			0
he left the shelter to get supplies a month ago and has not made it back			0
and her gran trembled as she explained how two other relatives died			0
virtually everyone in the shelter -- about 300 people -- had similar horrific stories of violent death			0
and it was easy to learn how death could come arbitrarily and suddenly in @entity16 and how survival was as much luck as anything else			2
working in a home that had become an unofficial media center for the few @entity172 journalists that have made it into @entity16 , a rocket slammed into the building just two floors up			1
also in @entity16 was @entity178 correspondent @entity177 who would be killed alongside @entity180 photographer @entity179 just a few days later			2
throughout @entity16 , word was spreading that a ground offensive by the @entity20 military was imminent			1
and for @entity0 it was becoming too dangerous to let @entity66 , @entity185 and @entity59 stay			2
@entity66 said : " it is fundamentally unfair that we live in a world where we can go film this , report on it , and leave , knowing that the people we 've left behind 's suffering is going to continue			0
feeling as if we should 've done more , we could 've done more			0
" hundreds of civilians are believed to have died in the siege of @entity16			2
at least three activists involved in getting video out of @entity16 have been killed			2
at the end of february , the @entity20 military broke the resistance of @entity16			1
opposition activists claim the military carried out summary executions			0
regime forces continue to bombard other areas that oppose @entity36 's rule .			0

@entity0 crew explains how they were smuggled into @entity16 , @entity20 , to witness a brutal *crackdown* on regime opponents
after a year of protests across @entity20 , @entity16 was the focus of a military effort to quash the uprising
women live in basements , snipers kill from rooftops , medics battle the odds in chaos
a home being used as a media center was targeted by the @entity20 military surrounding the city
