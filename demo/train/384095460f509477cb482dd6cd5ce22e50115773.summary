@entity0 -- a college senior studying @entity3 says he was wrongly detained for almost five hours last summer after an airport screener found his @entity3 - @entity6 flash cards and a book critical of @entity9 foreign policy			1
@entity10 , 22 , a senior at @entity11 in @entity12 , filed suit in federal court wednesday against the @entity15 , the @entity16 and the @entity17			1
he says he was handcuffed and " abusively interrogated " by authorities at @entity19			0
the lawsuit , filed by the @entity21 , alleges officials violated @entity10 's @entity24 protections against unreasonable seizure and first amendment rights to free speech			1
" @entity29 does n't object and we do n't object to the fact that he was searched closely , that his belongings were scrutinized , " @entity21 attorney @entity28 told @entity1			0
" but once that 's done , there 's absolutely no justification for handcuffing him and locking him in a cell for several hours			2
" all three agencies named in the suit declined to comment			2
but one official , who could not speak on the record about matters involving pending litigation , said security agents focused on @entity10 because of " erratic " behavior before he reached the checkpoint			1
@entity10 , of @entity47 , @entity48 , said he is studying @entity3 because of his interest in @entity51 politics			1
he plans to take a foreign service exam later this year , he said			0
" i want to serve my country using my arabic language , " @entity10 told @entity1			2
" and it just seems crazy to me that for that i was arrested and treated like a criminal			0
" he said the incident occurred august 29 after he arrived at the @entity19 airport for a flight to @entity12 to begin his senior year at @entity11			2
when he was asked to empty his pockets at the airport checkpoint , he produced a set of handmade flash cards , which piqued the interest of the @entity15 screener			1
the flash cards had an @entity6 word on one side and the corresponding @entity3 word on the other			1
of the approximately 200 flash cards , about 10 had words such as " bomb , " " explosion , " and " terrorist , " @entity10 said			1
" they asked me why i had those words			0
i told them honestly because i had been trying to read @entity3 news media , especially @entity78 , and these are words that come up when you read the news about the @entity51 , " @entity10 said			1
he said he was in the secondary screening area for about a half hour before a @entity15 supervisor arrived and began questioning him in a " hostile and aggressive manner			2
" noting that @entity10 had a book titled " @entity86 : @entity93 and the @entity94 , " the supervisor asked him a series of questions , including " who did 9/11 ? " and " do you know what language he spoke ? " the supervisor then held up the flash cards and said , " do you see why these cards are suspicious ? " @entity10 said			1
he said he was then turned over to a @entity19 police officer , who handcuffed him and placed him in an airport jail cell while officers examined his possessions			0
they " appeared particularly interested in the flash cards " and a student id card issued to @entity10 during a study abroad program in @entity105			1
@entity10 later was turned over to the @entity17 , who questioned him for about 30 minutes before freeing him			1
" my attitude during all of this was -- just answer the questions fully and honestly			0
do n't give any lip			0
do n't do anything that will arouse suspicion , and they 'll just pass it by because i had nothing seditious			0
... i had nothing dangerous			0
i had nothing that would pose any threat to anyone , " @entity10 told @entity1			2
" i 'm absolutely certain that i never raised my voice			0
i never got smart with them , " he said			0
@entity10 said he is angered by his treatment			2
one government official , who spoke on background because of the pending litigation , said @entity15 behavior detection officers observed @entity10 " exhibiting anomalous behavior " before he reached the checkpoint			1
the official did not elaborate			0
@entity10 " was referred for additional screening , where his behavior escalated further , " the official said			1
" as a result of a number of factors , including the passenger 's erratic behavior , local law enforcement was called to the checkpoint to investigate further			2
" @entity21 attorney @entity28 called the alleged incident " an amazing abuse of authority			0
" " we need to really make clear that @entity9 do n't give up their constitutional rights when they choose to fly by plane , " he said			0
" when @entity145 was handcuffed , arrested and locked in a cell for several hours just for carrying @entity3 - @entity6 flash cards , that was not only illegal and unconstitutional but absolutely did nothing to make air travel any safer			1
" in fact what it does is it diverts resources from the kind of real security efforts that we need more of			0
" one year ago , @entity158 and two @entity15 screeners paid $ 240,000 to an @entity161 man to settle claims that they refused to let him aboard a flight until he had covered up his t - shirt , which read , " we will not be @entity166 " in @entity6 and @entity3			1
the man , @entity167 , said one screener told him , " coming to an airport while wearing a t - shirt with @entity3 letters on it was equivalent to going into a bank while wearing a shirt saying , ' i am a robber			1
' " in the settlement , @entity158 and the screeners denied any wrongdoing , and said they were acting only to resolve the 2 1/2 - year - old federal lawsuit			0
@entity1 's @entity178 contributed to this report .			0
