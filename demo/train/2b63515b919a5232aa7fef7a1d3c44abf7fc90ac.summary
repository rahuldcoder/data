-- strange things happened in a small courtroom in the @entity4 city of @entity5 last week			0
@entity7 mayoral candidate , and my colleague in the @entity4 opposition , @entity11 , was convicted july 18 on concocted embezzlement charges in the type of political show trial that @entity15 favored long before his spiritual successor president @entity16 embraced them			1
then , the very next morning , the same prosecutor asked for @entity11 's release pending his appeal			1
it was a move so unexpected that an incredulous @entity11 asked the court to make sure the prosecutor had not been swapped for an identical twin overnight			1
that something surprising happened in a @entity4 courtroom is itself surprising			0
as with our so - called elections , important trial outcomes are decided well in advance and with little need for evidence			1
( when the @entity5 judge went to his chambers to deliberate over @entity11 's release , one wit tweeted " the @entity38 connection to @entity7 must be particularly slow today			1
" ) the judicial process and the democratic process in @entity4 are both elaborate mockeries created to distract the citizenry at home and to help @entity45 leaders avoid confronting the awkward fact that @entity4 has returned to a police state while they stood by or , in many cases , while they eagerly did business with the repressive @entity16 regime			0
that this strange occurrence happened to the most prominent member of the @entity54 opposition movement is therefore shocking and meaningful			0
in @entity56 , political dissidents simply do not get out of jail			0
@entity58 , once @entity4 's wealthiest man , has been imprisoned since his october 2003 arrest for the " crime " of disloyalty to @entity16			1
everyone knows his jail term is exactly as long as @entity16 's stay in power , no shorter and no longer			1
it is no coincidence that @entity11 's sentence will leave him in prison safely beyond the 2018 presidential elections			1
the motivations for @entity11 's brief respite are unclear , and will likely always remain so , but it likely reflects factional infighting inside the @entity75			1
@entity16 's main allies , the security and intelligence forces known as the siloviki , advocate ever - greater repression			1
they want to jail every opposition leader and activist and prevent any legitimate expression of democracy			0
former @entity16 classmate @entity87 is the leader and symbol of the siloviki camp			0
as former top prosecutor and current chief of the powerful @entity92 , @entity87 is the administration 's main weapon against political and social resistance			2
apparently @entity87 is not all powerful , however , and @entity11 's hurried release counts as a defeat for his authority			1
but it is not clear for whom it was a victory			0
@entity11 is running for mayor in @entity7 in what was expected at the start to be another electoral charade			1
but incumbent mayor @entity106 -- worried about a repeat of the 2011 protests against the blatantly fraudulent parliamentary elections which brought hundreds of thousands onto the streets , actually helped @entity11 get on the ballot			1
it is likely @entity106 and those in the @entity75 sympathetic to his position on social unrest were behind @entity11 's release			1
@entity106 craves the legitimacy of retaining his prestigious position as the mayor of @entity7 in a relatively fair contest against @entity11			1
he believes this would position him as a leading contender to succeed @entity16 when the dictator inevitably falls			2
@entity106 is hardly a democrat , but his selfish interests may work to bring democracy back to @entity4			0
conjecture aside , @entity11 's quick release was either incompetence or high - level internal sabotage -- and neither possibility is good news for @entity16			1
the siloviki live in a @entity133 bubble , working to keep the lid of repression down as tightly as possible for as long as possible			0
but others , including @entity106 , look ahead and realize that taking this path will make the eventual explosion of opposition even stronger			0
some of them are ambitious enough to chafe at @entity16 's obvious intent to hold power for life			2
they are far from liberal reformers , of course , and are seeking to advance their own interests			2
but at the moment those interests are leading them to undermine @entity16 's iron grip on every lever of power			2
this matters , because the policeman on the @entity7 street gets his strength from the knowledge that his superiors will support him unconditionally			0
he can crack open a protester 's skull knowing his captain will defend his action			2
the captain knows the colonel will defend him because the general will protect him , the judges will protect them , and so on all the way up to the plushest chair in @entity16 's office			2
this unbroken chain is critical and a public weakening of the links at the top means @entity176 moves a bit closer to @entity178			0
the protests that erupted after @entity11 's conviction were the largest unsanctioned rallies since 2011 and the police let them happen nearly without incident			1
( the prosecution 's request to release @entity11 was made immediately after the verdict was read			1
) there is doubt in the ranks because they sense doubt at the top			0
if @entity11 is set free , wonders the police captain , should he give the order to beat those protesters demonstrating in his name ? this may be only a brief moment of hesitation , but it is real			1
cracks are appearing in the @entity202 ade elsewhere as well			0
@entity203 , the oligarch who pretended to be an opposition candidate in last year 's presidential election without saying a word against @entity16 , is now openly supporting @entity208 mayor @entity207 after he was arrested on bribery charges			2
( @entity75 partners do not suffer such indignities			1
) another @entity203 ally , @entity212 , is running for the mayoralty of @entity4 's third - largest city , @entity215			2
the most popular slogans during last week 's spontaneous rallies were " @entity219 ! " ( " freedom ! " ) and " @entity16 vor ! " ( " @entity16 's a thief ! " ) the situation looks increasingly unbalanced			2
a new wave of mass protests could force the @entity16 regime to find out how loyal its security forces really are			0
@entity11 is still convicted and he may be allowed to run for mayor only to attempt to discredit him before jailing him			1
if he gains too much support he can be locked up at any time , or worse , as he well knows , although this would create just the sort of scandal @entity106 would like to avoid in his quest to appear to be a legitimately elected official			0
but the election might not be as easy as they think			0
in last year 's presidential election @entity16 received 47 % of the vote in @entity7 -- and those are the official numbers , not real ones -- despite epic fraud and despite facing no real opposition			2
can @entity106 then be expected to surpass the 50 % needed to avoid a second ballot without resorting to the same tactics that spawned outrage in 2011 ? @entity11 is a real fighter and he has thousands of enthusiastic volunteers to campaign for him and to closely observe the election process on september 8			1
there are only bad choices for the @entity75 at this point			1
their fear of @entity11 and the movement he represents is provoking conflict and confusion			1
in the movie " @entity257 " , @entity255 's character wakes up in @entity259 's arms after an eternity of repeating the same day over and over			2
" something is ... different , " he says			0
" good or bad ? " she asks			0
" anything different is good , " he answers			0
something different happened in @entity5 last week and my optimism tells me it was a positive sign			0
after more than 13 years of predictable repression under @entity16 , anything different is good			0
we should not let avid speculation distract us from the cruel reality of @entity11 's situation -- and of @entity56			1
the lives of opposition members and journalists are worth very little			0
a man will spend five years in a labor camp for nothing more than speaking openly his opposition to @entity16			0
@entity11 's former colleague , @entity279 , refused to testify against him and got a four - year sentence			1
he has five young children			0
and for every case you hear about , there are dozens of others forming this new generation of political prisoners under @entity16			0
the big picture is important , but we lose our humanity if we lose sight of the real people whose stories make up that picture			2
success for @entity11 's campaign in @entity7 , any demonstration that he has substantial popular support , would change the atmosphere of the country and give these prisoners hope			1
and it would give us all hope that real change is on the way .			0

important trial outcomes are decided well in advance and with little need for evidence , writes @entity311
the motivations for @entity11 's brief respite are unclear but it likely reflects factional infighting inside the @entity75 , he says
@entity311 believes success for @entity11 's campaign would change the atmosphere of the country
