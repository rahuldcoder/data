-- recently , the @entity1 on @entity2 successfully ignited a public discussion about dietary supplements			1
but this is only a first step , and of no substantive value without continued careful objective and scientific re-evaluation of how we view these products			0
the $ 30 billion dietary supplements industry , one of the fastest growing industries in the world , has reason to celebrate			1
more than half of @entity18 are taking supplements			1
this year marks the 20th anniversary of the passage of one of the most skillful pieces of legislation ever to undermine the health of @entity18 : the @entity26 of 1994			1
the result was to remove from regulation by the @entity29 any substances labeled as a dietary supplement			1
the act was passed with strong bipartisan support			0
after all , should n't we make it easier for @entity18 to access good nutrition ? if it is nutrition , is n't it good for you ? and , if a nutrient is essential for an important body function , should n't more of it improve that body function ? but supplements are not quite the amazing panacea that we have been led to believe			1
supplements , which include substances such as vitamins and herbs , but can also include hormones and other pharmacologically active ingredients , can impact the effect and safety of various medications and alter our body 's physiologic functions			1
for instance , severe bleeding has been reported as a result of supplements taken at recommended doses around the time of even minor surgery			2
this is of great concern given that a survey conducted by researchers at the @entity68 found that 40 % of patients undergoing surgery were taking herbal and vitamin supplements that block normal blood clotting and predispose them to excessive bleeding , and 17 % were taking supplements that may prolong the effect of anesthesia			1
nutrients are chemicals , and almost all are known to have toxicity when taken in high doses			0
look in any nutrition textbook and you will find lists of vitamin toxicities , some of which may even be fatal			2
for example , overdose of vitamin a will cause brain swelling and liver failure			2
this is , fortunately , not common			0
but intake of vitamin a , only slightly higher than the recommended daily allowance , has been associated with thinning of bones and a higher risk for fractures			2
some supplements , like zinc , may cause harm even at low doses , since it can cause a significant decrease in the levels of copper , another essential mineral for the body			2
@entity109 and selenium supplements have both been proven , in a well - designed randomized trial with more than 35,000 men , to cause statistically significant increases in the incidence of aggressive prostate cancer			1
the @entity116 felt the results were concerning enough to post them on their website , with a strongly worded warning that men should not take these , despite the claims of supplement proponents who vehemently deny the scientific data , based on outlandish theories			2
nor do these proponents disclose conflicts of interest , which real scientists are ethically bound to reveal when they are in a position to make personal gains			0
despite the proven risks , the market is glutted with supplement companies and vitamin pushers who argue that supplements , from multivitamins to herbal cures for everything from the common cold to obesity , are natural and thus , safe			1
they fiercely advocate for keeping access to dietary supplements unfettered by government regulation , claiming that further regulation would unfairly deprive the public of access to these potentially beneficial substances			1
they cite theory and inappropriate data to support their claims and dismiss any evidence to the contrary			0
proper randomized studies , such as those performed to establish safety and efficacy of prescription medications , are needed to establish cause and effect of supplements			2
such studies require large numbers of patients and are extremely costly			0
without regulatory pressures , there is little motivation for industry to do the studies , even as supplements bring in large profits from sales to the @entity18 public			1
the other option is observational or epidemiological research , which is easier and less expensive			0
but conclusions from these studies can only be used to note the coincidence of events , not cause and effect			0
erroneous conclusions are often drawn ( e.g. , only overweight people are on diets , therefore being on diets causes obesity )			0
and guesswork , which some supplement proponents use to deny the science , costs nothing			0
most people , scientists and nonscientists , are not aware of the weaknesses in the scientific data on supplements			0
part of this misunderstanding is the fault of us nutrition experts , who want very much to provide something to slake the hunger of the public for advice on what to do to stay young , thin , fit and healthy , and are loathe to say " we do n't know			0
" it is a hopeful sign that this issue has come to the attention of the @entity1 on @entity2			0
but there is so much to be done			0
just because a product is brought to market and labeled as a dietary supplements , guarantees neither efficacy nor , more importantly , safety			1
on this anniversary of the @entity224 , with lawmakers now willing to challenge this powerful industry , it is time to reassess the regulation of dietary supplements , consider our priorities in how funding is granted for nutrition research , reeducate the community of nutrition experts as well as the public , and be honest about our inability to offer definitive , safe and effective nutritional recommendations .			1

more than half of @entity18 are taking supplements , *fueling* a $ 30 billion industry
@entity241 : but supplements are not the amazing panacea that we are led to believe
he says vitamin e and selenium supplements , for example , may not be safe for men
@entity252 : we need to reassess regulation of dietary supplements and educate the public
