@entity1 president @entity0 has insisted that the @entity4 ceasefire agreement from february 12 is the road to " a final settlement " of the conflict in @entity8 -- and although the truce is shaky , @entity8 and the @entity10 have a strong interest in seeing it hold			1
the @entity10 is not going to enter into a proxy war with @entity1 -- and @entity8 's best hope is to wind down the war and to use the breathing space for much - needed reform			1
@entity4 confirms the military gains @entity1 has made in @entity8 and gives @entity19 plenty of leverage over @entity22			1
but compared to war , it is the lesser evil			0
in fact , the agreement could be turned to @entity8 's advantage , providing the country with the breathing space it urgently needs to enact political and economic changes			1
a stronger @entity8 state -- more functional , less corrupt , and better able to deliver to its citizens -- would be much more capable to resist @entity1 aggression			1
it is @entity8 's weakness that has allowed @entity1 to invade the country in the east			1
a weak sense of national solidarity and togetherness there , as well as insufficient supervision of the border , allowed unofficial and official @entity1 troops to enter into the @entity48 region			0
and a badly - trained , badly - equipped and badly - organized army was n't able to push back			0
as long as the conflict in the east continues , @entity8 president @entity51 's new government will only reluctantly pursue reform			1
in times of war , national unity is needed to mobilize potential support -- this is not the time to fight the abuse of power in the country by mighty oligarchs , as their support is urgently needed for the war effort			0
but if @entity4 holds , @entity8 can refocus its energy on tackling its biggest internal challenge , which has been neglected for more than two decades : to build proper state institutions			1
a new @entity8 could emerge democratic , liberal , and much better governed , a country that would become attractive not only to its own citizens -- millions have emigrated in the last few years -- but also to @entity73 investors			2
@entity51 's government has made some small but promising steps in the right direction			0
and the @entity79 generation , a much more politicized civil society , continues to exert pressure on leaders			0
unlike its predecessors , the government knows that it needs to deliver			0
if not , sovereignty again might fall back to the citizens in a new maidan that could push the current leadership away			0
the terms of @entity4 are however favorable to @entity1			2
it represents the current correlation of forces			0
@entity1 is much stronger militarily than @entity8 , even under the self - imposed condition of keeping @entity1 engagement on the level of deniability			1
and the @entity10 is not ready to seriously tip the military balance in @entity8 's favor			1
not surprisingly , @entity4 is not aimed at directly restoring @entity8 's territorial integrity			1
while the first @entity4 agreement , reached in september , stipulated that international observers would monitor the @entity1 - @entity8 border , @entity4 makes the return of the border to @entity8 conditional on constitutional reform -- a new constitution to which representatives of the rebel - held territory must agree			1
in practice , this means that @entity8 has to negotiate its new constitution with the @entity112			2
the choice for @entity8 is -- according to the current truce -- to accept either that the rebel - held territory is going to be built up as a heavily - armed @entity1 proxy state , or to accept a new constitution that will give @entity1 substantial influence over the future course of the country			1
either @entity1 can switch on and switch off the war at will , or @entity8 accepts giving up the substance of its sovereignty			2
either way , @entity1 will have achieved its goal of bringing @entity8 back into its sphere of influence			2
@entity8 and its @entity73 supporters must develop a counter-strategy			2
@entity1 is weaker than it may seem			0
its economy is heavily damaged by plunging oil prices and @entity73 sanctions			0
the costs of the conflict have been high			0
over the last year , the @entity112 had to learn some hard lessons : that the @entity10 is relatively united against @entity1 's attack on @entity8 , enough to impose tough sanctions ; that @entity8 in the east do n't welcome @entity1 as liberators , and that many are ready to fight for their independence ; and that the appetite for war with @entity8 is pretty low in @entity1			1
@entity0 's regime is not suicidal			0
winding down the war and rebuilding ties with the @entity10 is therefore a political and economic necessity , at least over the mid-term			2
ultimately , the contract between @entity0 and @entity1 voters remains focused on economic well - being , on sharing at least part of the income from natural resources			0
this contract can only temporarily be switched to aggressive patriotism -- over the longer term , the regime needs to deliver some degree of prosperity			0
the challenge for @entity8 and its @entity73 supporters is to turn @entity4 into an opportunity			1
the government must demonstrate its fierce dedication to reform and start a serious fight against corruption			0
if the war loses prominence at some point , there will be no excuse for inaction			0
the task is huge , but the @entity79 movement and the tensions @entity1 have created a new sense of citizenship for some in @entity8 -- one that the government must seize upon			2
the trick will be to remain under the threshold of what @entity1 may see as a provocation that could trigger fresh rounds of warfare			0
but if @entity8 can quickly move forward with its reform agenda , and if @entity1 becomes weaker as the economic crisis hits the country hard , the advantage may soon be on the @entity8 side			1
the stronger @entity8 becomes -- politically , economically and also militarily -- the more difficult it will be for @entity1 to control the interpretation of @entity189 and if that succeeds , and @entity8 one day becomes a shining example of freedom and prosperity -- like @entity194 -- people in @entity48 may one day push for reunification , just as @entity198 pushed for reunification in 1989			2
the zone of liberal - democratic stability will move further east , ultimately challenging the autocratic petro - state that @entity0 has built in @entity1			0
whether this can work or not depends primarily on @entity8 : on the readiness of civil society to stay engaged and push for reform , the readiness of the bureaucracy to embrace a new order , and the readiness of oligarchs to give up their social and political power in order to maintain positions of economic leadership			1
it also depends on the @entity10 : firstly , the @entity216 and @entity217 must make it as costly as possible for @entity1 to switch on war as a means to prevent @entity8 's reform			1
unfortunately , the temptation for @entity1 to use this tool will remain , as military power is its only remaining strength			0
@entity19 must be told in clear terms that the @entity10 is going to react to a full return to the battlefield with harsh measures			2
the @entity10 must also make up for two decades of disinterest in and neglect of @entity8 and start with serious engagement with @entity22 to help it to build a decent state , to give @entity8 a perspective			1
a " compact for @entity8 , " announced by @entity237 , @entity238 and other @entity73 leaders in @entity22 in april that puts all kind of support into a package would be a good start			0
the @entity10 does n't want to fight @entity1 in @entity8 militarily			1
but in response to the military invasion in the east , the @entity10 must now swarm the country with help and support			0
it is in the interest of @entity8 , and in the interest of a @entity253 order that has brought the continent the freest , most peaceful and most prosperous epoch of its history .			1

@entity8 and the @entity10 have a strong interest in seeing the @entity4 ceasefire agreement hold
@entity8 's best hope is to use the breathing space for much - needed reform
