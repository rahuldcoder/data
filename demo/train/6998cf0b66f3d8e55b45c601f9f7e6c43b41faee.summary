-- @entity2 secretary of state @entity1 calls it proof " beyond any reasonable doubt			1
" defense secretary @entity6 says it 's " very clear			2
" president @entity8 says the @entity2 has " high confidence " that @entity10 used chemical weapons -- the strongest position the @entity2 can take short of confirmation			1
@entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity16 say their intelligence backs up the same conclusion			1
but despite all the talk about conclusive intelligence , questions remain			2
a declassified report by the @entity24 does not divulge all details of the evidence the @entity2 is looking at			1
and it remains unclear what the " streams of intelligence " cited in the report may be and how they were collected			1
@entity33 insists there 's no proof			2
@entity33 president @entity36 said he wants to see evidence that would make the determination " obvious			1
" and @entity10 president @entity40 's regime says rebel forces were behind any chemical weapons attack			2
the @entity43 , meanwhile , is calling on world leaders to wait for the results of a @entity43 probe			1
here 's a look at what is known about the intelligence @entity50 points to			2
@entity1 cites ' concrete ' evidence " we have declassified unprecedented amounts of information , and we ask the @entity2 people and the rest of the world to judge that information , " @entity1 told lawmakers tuesday			1
it " proves the @entity40 regime prepared for this attack , issued instruction to prepare for this attack , warned its own forces to use gas masks			0
" physical , " concrete " evidence shows where the rockets came from , when they were fired , and that not one landed in regime - controlled territory , @entity1 said			1
" multiple streams of intelligence indicate that the regime executed a rocket and artillery attack against the @entity80 suburbs in the early hours of august 21 , " the @entity24 says in the declassified report			1
" satellite detections corroborate that attacks from a regime - controlled area struck neighborhoods where the chemical attacks reportedly occurred			0
... the lack of flight activity or missile launches also leads us to conclude that the regime used rockets in the attack			0
" the @entity24 released a map along with the report			0
but the prospect of more details on the evidence seems dim as @entity1 said the amount already declassified " could possibly put at risk some sources and methods , " and that releasing more could " tempt fate			1
" @entity2 : opposition does n't have ' the capacity ' " we are certain that none of the opposition has the weapons or capacity to effect a strike of this scale , particularly from the heart of regime territory , " @entity1 told lawmakers tuesday			1
the @entity24 report points to @entity10 's known stockpiles of chemical agents			2
and it says the @entity2 assesses " with high confidence that the @entity10 regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale against the opposition multiple times in the last year , including in the @entity80 suburbs			1
this assessment is based on multiple streams of information including reporting of @entity10 officials planning and executing chemical weapons attacks and laboratory analysis of physiological samples obtained from a number of individuals , which revealed exposure to sarin			1
" we assess that the opposition has not used chemical weapons			0
" in may , a @entity43 official said there were strong suspicions that @entity10 rebel forces had used sarin gas			0
but the findings were not conclusive , the @entity145 for @entity10 said at the time , and the opposition @entity147 condemned any use of chemical weapons			0
the @entity149 said at the time it had no evidence suggesting rebels had used chemical weapons			2
the @entity152 said wednesday the results of an investigation into a march attack in @entity156 , apparently using chemical weapons , found that the charge used was homemade and similar to projectiles produced by the group @entity159 , part of the opposition @entity161			2
@entity163 was discovered in samples from the scene , the foreign ministry said			0
@entity166 has slammed @entity10 for the recent chemical weapons attack in @entity80 , and vowed revenge			0
@entity2 : @entity10 prepared " in the three days prior to the attack , we collected streams of human , signals and geospatial intelligence that reveal regime activities that we assess were associated with preparations for a chemical weapons attack , " the @entity2 report says			1
" @entity10 chemical weapons personnel were operating in the @entity80 suburb of ' @entity181 from sunday , august 18 until early in the morning on wednesday , august 21 near an area that the regime uses to mix chemical weapons , including sarin			0
on august 21 , a @entity10 regime element prepared for a chemical weapons attack in the @entity80 area , including through the utilization of gas masks			0
our intelligence sources in the @entity80 area did not detect any indications in the days prior to the attack that opposition affiliates were planning to use chemical weapons			0
" ' intercepted communications ' " we have a body of information , including past @entity10 practice , that leads us to conclude that regime officials were witting of and directed the attack on august 21 , " the @entity2 report says			1
" we intercepted communications involving a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime on august 21 and was concerned with the @entity43 inspectors obtaining evidence			2
" intelligence shows @entity10 chemical weapons personnel were told to cease operations in the afternoon of august 21 , and that the regime then " intensified the artillery barrage targeting many of the neighborhoods where chemical attacks occurred , " the report says			0
analyst : ' no way in hell ' @entity2 can back up death toll the @entity2 report says a preliminary assessment " determined that 1,429 people were killed in the chemical weapons attack , including at least 426 children			1
" the assessment " will certainly evolve as we obtain more information , " it adds			2
" secretary @entity1 seems to have been sandbagged into using an absurdly over-precise number , " said @entity227 , former director of intelligence assessment at the @entity229			1
now with the @entity236 , he writes on the @entity236 website , " put simply , there is no way in hell the @entity2 intelligence community could credibly have made an estimate this exact			1
" it 's unclear whether " these figures really had an intelligence source , " @entity227 said			0
" some sources indicate they may have actually come from a @entity10 source called the @entity243 ( @entity243 ) " -- a @entity10 opposition group			0
a @entity2 official told @entity0 the number is not based on opposition figures			1
the methodology used to come up with the toll remains classified			0
rebel leaders have given similar estimates for the death toll , saying more than 1,300 people were killed			2
@entity14 's @entity254 , meanwhile , says at least 350 people were killed			1
it does not say how the figure was determined			0
a @entity15 government report notes that body counts by several sources , including @entity261 , estimated at least 355 deaths			1
" other technical counts , using different sources , estimate the toll to be around 1,500 deaths , " the report says			0
@entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 weigh in a letter from @entity269 , chairman of @entity14 's @entity270 , to @entity14 prime minister @entity271 , also rejects suggestions that the opposition may have been behind the attack			1
" we have tested this assertion using a wide range of intelligence and open sources , and invited ( the government ) and outside experts to help us establish whether such a thing is possible , " @entity269 wrote			0
no " credible intelligence " suggests the opposition has chemical weapons , he writes , adding that " there are no plausible alternative scenarios to regime responsibility			0
" " we also have a limited but growing body of intelligence which supports the judgment that the regime was responsible for the attacks and that they were conducted to help clear the opposition from strategic parts of @entity80			0
some of this intelligence is highly sensitive but you have had access to it all			0
" @entity15 gives a similar argument			1
" the attack of august 21st could only have been ordered and carried out by the regime , " its declassified intelligence report says			2
@entity16 's foreign intelligence agency , the @entity304 , has the same assessment			1
" in a secret briefing to select lawmakers on monday , @entity304 head @entity306 said that while there is still no incontestable proof , analysis of the evidence at hand has led his intelligence service to believe that @entity40 's regime is to blame , " @entity317 reports			2
@entity43 probe : limited scope , no clear deadline the @entity43 is pushing all nations to hold off on any action until results of its own examination are in			2
it 's unclear how soon that may be			0
" the @entity43 mission is uniquely capable of establishing in an impartial and credible manner the facts of any use of chemical weapons , " @entity327 , spokesman for @entity328 ban ki - moon , said repeatedly at a news conference sunday			0
but the @entity43 probe 's mandate is only to determine whether chemical weapons were used -- not by whom			2
@entity8 argued wednesday that that 's no longer in question			0
" frankly , nobody is really disputing that chemical weapons were used , " he said			0
@entity33 - which , along with @entity341 , would likely block any @entity43 resolution authorizing military action in @entity10 -- has repeatedly thrown cold water on suggestions that there 's proof of @entity10 culpability			0
" if there are data that the chemical weapons have been used , and used specifically by the regular army , this evidence should be submitted to the @entity356 , " @entity36 said wednesday in an interview with the @entity350 and @entity33 's state channel 1 television			1
" it should be a deep and specific probe containing evidence that would be obvious and prove beyond doubt who did it and what means were used			1
" if there was such evidence , @entity33 might support a resolution authorizing military strikes , @entity36 said			1
@entity10 : allegations ' false and unfounded ' @entity10 still insists it never used chemical weapons			0
" these allegations are false and unfounded , " @entity10 's @entity43 ambassador @entity371 said tuesday in an interview with @entity0			0
he cited the confidence that the @entity2 said it had a decade ago when it argued that @entity375 had weapons of mass destruction			1
it 's an argument @entity1 was prepared for before @entity379 on tuesday			1
he noted that he and @entity380 were senators at the time of the @entity375 vote			0
" and so we are especially sensitive , @entity6 and i , to never again asking any member of @entity379 to take a vote on faulty intelligence			0
and that is why our intelligence community has scrubbed and re-scrubbed the evidence			2

@entity1 says the @entity2 has declassified " unprecedented amounts of information "
the @entity2 points to " concrete " evidence , intercepts , " multiple streams of information "
@entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity16 come to similar conclusions
@entity36 calls for " a deep and specific probe containing evidence that would be obvious "
