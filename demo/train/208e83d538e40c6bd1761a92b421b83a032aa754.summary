-- every now and then , being a jerk on the @entity2 can result in some unwanted attention			0
from 2009 to 2013 , the operators of @entity5 created profiles for millions of people , including children , using information that was scraped off @entity10 , according to charges filed monday by the @entity12			1
the site continues to operate			0
the profiles , which were supposedly created by users of the site , labeled people a " jerk " or " not a jerk			2
" also , the site claimed -- falsely , according to the @entity12 -- that the subjects could edit their profiles if they paid a $ 30 membership fee			1
the complaint says that , in fact , operators of the site created more than 73 million profiles with @entity10 information , some of which had been posted as private and which included intimate images such as parents bathing their young children and a mother breast - feeding			1
many users who paid to join the site received nothing in return , according to the @entity12			2
" in today 's interconnected world , people are especially concerned about their reputation online , and this deceptive scheme was a brazen attempt to exploit those concerns , " said @entity36 , director of the @entity12 's @entity37			2
an attorney for @entity5 did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment			0
but in a document from last year seeking to dismiss the case , @entity47 called the government 's case against the site a " fishing expedition			0
" she wrote that profiles on the site , which received almost 100,000 visitors a day , are created by users and that profiles generally display " information that is publicly available in a @entity60 internet search as well as newly created user generated content			1
" she also said that the site deleted profiles of children 14 and younger if those profiles were brought to their attention			0
the document also claimed that , in 2012 , only 22 people subscribed to the site and its total revenue was about $ 3,000			0
@entity71 profiles included buttons that allowed users to vote on whether someone was a " jerk " or not , as well as add personal information and comments about that person			2
in some cases , the @entity12 said , those comments were " derisive and abusive			0
" the @entity12 says that the site created phony @entity10 apps that operators then used to download the names and photos of millions of users			1
the commission is seeking a court order barring the " deceptive practices , " prohibiting @entity5 from using information they obtained improperly and requiring them to delete profiles created from scraped @entity10 information .			1
