as a second round of peace talks ended saturday with little progress in ending @entity8 's civil war , @entity1 president @entity0 and @entity3 's @entity2 spoke about @entity8 's distressing humanitarian crisis during an earlier meeting in @entity11			1
@entity3 is a refuge for war - battered @entity8 , and both leaders urged an end to the warfare that has caused such a mass exodus			1
they also discussed a possible @entity19 sanction to pressure the @entity8 regime of president @entity21			1
meanwhile , in @entity23 , @entity19 mediator @entity22 apologized to the @entity8 people , saying he was " very , very sorry " that , despite two rounds of talks , " we have n't done very much			1
" in minimal progress , the two warring sides have agreed to an agenda for a third round of talks , but they have not agreed on how to tackle it , @entity22 said			2
in @entity34 , @entity34 foreign minister @entity33 described the latest developments as " a serious setback in the search for peace in @entity8			1
" @entity33 blamed the @entity8 regime because it refused to discuss a transitional government			1
@entity22 said the key sticking point is that the @entity8 government wants to talk about tackling terrorism , while the opposition wants to discuss forming a transitional governing body			2
@entity22 said he had suggested starting the next round of talks with one day of discussion on each issue , but the government would not agree			0
" unfortunately the government has refused , which raises the suspicion of the opposition that , in fact , the government does n't want to discuss the ( transitional governing body ) at all , " he said			2
@entity22 said such intransigence was " not good for the process , " nor was it good for @entity8			2
negotiators should go back to their leaders and reflect on a way forward , he said			0
" do they want this process to take place or not ? " @entity65 , of the opposition umbrella group @entity66 , said : " we want to progress on the two sides			0
we want to be assured that the regime is really wanting a political solution , not delay tactics , and we did n't get that , for reasons that were described by mr. @entity22			2
" our heart is in pain , our delegation is in pain , that as we speak here searching for a political solution the regime has chosen to bombard towns and cities killing civilians			0
" @entity8 ambassador to the @entity19 @entity85 , in turn , accused the opposition of trying to mislead observers and undermine the process			1
" we are committed to serving the interests of our own people , in stopping the bloodshed , " he told reporters in @entity23			0
" we do n't have an impasse			0
we are still in negotiations ; we did n't say that we have failed			0
" @entity3 and the @entity1 in @entity11 , @entity0 and @entity2 held a meeting friday that lasted until almost midnight in the desert community of @entity97 , near @entity98			1
@entity0 said the @entity1 would seek ways to bring peace			1
" we 're going to continue to strategize on how we can effectively change the calculus inside the country so that we can have a @entity8 that is intact , that is respectful of all groups , that ends the killing , and that allows for a representative government that can provide peace and prosperity for everybody there , " @entity0 said			1
" there will be some intermediate steps that we can take to apply more pressure to the @entity21 regime , and we 're going to be continuing to work with all the parties concerned to try to move forward on a diplomatic solution			2
" @entity0 noted that @entity3 has just taken a rotating seat on the @entity19 @entity117			1
in a background briefing with pool reporters after the meeting , a senior administration official said @entity0 and @entity122 discussed a possible @entity19 resolution that could pressure the @entity8 regime and " create a legal precedent for cross-border operations			1
" the @entity127 added that a strong resolution on @entity8 did n't necessarily need to include threats of force but could be " strong in terms of the obligations and expectations that it would impose on the regime to improve the humanitarian access			1
" @entity3 , a key @entity1 ally in the @entity136 , is hosting almost 600,000 refugees from @entity8 , and on saturday , the president announced new loan guarantees for @entity3 totaling $ 1 billion			1
the senior official targeted @entity141 in his remarks , urging the @entity141 to play a " more constructive role " in finding a solution			1
" as long as they remain wedded to the status quo , this is going to be a difficult problem to resolve , " the official said , speaking of @entity141 's continued support for the @entity8 regime			1
@entity141 " ca n't have it both ways , " the official said			1
" they ca n't say they 're in favor of negotiations in @entity23 and a transitional government guided by full executive authority and humanitarian access and have a happy @entity159 , and then be part and parcel of supporting this regime as it kills people in the most brutal way			2
" the @entity159 remark referred to the @entity166 now being held in @entity167 , @entity141			2
" i do n't think any of us have any expectation that they are going to turn on a dime , " the official conceded			2
he said the administration would not exclude the possibility of reaching " a humanitarian resolution " despite @entity141 's " sorry record " of vetoing @entity19 sanction resolutions			1
@entity2 said one of his main concerns , " is the rise of extremism in @entity8 , the sectarian violence , and if we do n't find a solution , the spillover in the region and the effect that will have			2
" the two leaders considered ways their countries could support what they described as the " moderate opposition " movement , the senior official said			2
elsewhere in the @entity1 , sen. @entity195 , @entity196 , said " failure is looming " in the @entity19 - mediated peace talks			1
" the entire strategy for success at @entity23 now relies on @entity141 putting pressure on the @entity8 government to engage in a serious and constructive way , " @entity195 said			1
" yet , @entity141 has recently prevented the passage of a much - needed @entity19 resolution on bringing aid to desperate @entity8 civilians and continues to provide the means by which president @entity21 carries out his assault on the @entity8 people			1
" such actions indicate that the @entity141 government is simply not a partner for peace in @entity8 and can not be relied on to help secure a successful outcome , " @entity195 said			1
more violence in @entity8 , rebels posted a video on social media purporting to show small group of fighters planting explosives in a tunnel underneath what they claim is the @entity225 in @entity226			2
the @entity227 said the hotel serves as an anti-insurgency headquarters for government security forces			0
@entity231 could not independently confirm the video 's authenticity			0
" we are putting our last touches and doing some measuring so we can make sure that we are under the @entity225 , " a rebel says in @entity235			0
" we are going to add the explosives after we finish everything , and you are going to hear good news , @entity226 people			0
" the video then cuts to an outdoor scene where billowing smoke rises over buildings , an apparent indication that the hotel was blown up saturday			0
the @entity8 government did n't immediately respond to the rebels ' claims in the video			2
peace talks the snail - paced peace talks , which started last month with @entity22 serving as an intermediary between the two delegations sitting in the same room , have failed to produce an agreement on a first step for resolving the conflict , which has dragged on for nearly three years			0
more than 140,000 @entity8 have died since march 2011 , according to the @entity227 , a @entity263 - based opposition group			2
about half of them were civilians , and more than 7,000 were children and more than 5,000 were women , it said			0
it put @entity8 military losses at more than 30,000 and pro-regime elements at more than 20,000			0
those figures do not include the 18,000 @entity8 who were jailed and are missing , it said			0
relief for besieged city @entity22 said he would consult next with @entity19 secretary - general @entity277 and called upon him to hold discussions with @entity1 secretary of state @entity279 and @entity141 foreign minster @entity280			1
@entity22 said he would also likely brief the permanent members of the @entity117 , known as the @entity282 -- the @entity1 , @entity141 , @entity34 , @entity283 and @entity284 -- and the full @entity117			1
the talks ' only sign of progress has been a cease - fire to allow some evacuations from and aid relief to the besieged city of @entity292			0
@entity19 emergency relief coordinator @entity293 said friday that 1,400 people were evacuated from the @entity295 of @entity292 and 2,500 still there got relief supplies , but she lamented the bleak humanitarian situation that prevails throughout the country			0
" the little that has been achieved in @entity292 , " @entity22 said , has given the @entity8 people hope that they might finally be " coming out of this horrible crisis they are in			0
" but the warring sides are still far apart			0
opposition : we want progress , not delaying tactics @entity22 said he hoped that , after a period of reflection , the two sides would return to the table " ready to engage seriously " over how to implement the so - called @entity23 communique that led to the talks			0
it calls for ending the conflict and establishing a transitional government			0
the opposition has proposed a transitional government that would oversee a halt in the fighting , releasing prisoners of conscience , maintaining law and order , bringing to justice those responsible for violence and protecting human rights			0
its plan excludes @entity21 from continued leadership , an outcome unacceptable to the longtime @entity8 leader			0
but @entity8 deputy foreign minister @entity333 said friday that the opposition has " an unrealistic agenda , " and he insisted the first step must be " stopping the violence and ending terrorism			1
" the government refers to the rebels as foreign - backed terrorists , so @entity333 's stance in essence calls for the opposition to unilaterally lay down its arms			0
" we confirm we are willing to discuss the issue of the transitional government after we reach an agreement regarding ending terrorism , " he said			0
@entity283 diplomat slams regime , praises opposition @entity352 , the @entity283 foreign minister , blamed the @entity8 government for the lack of advancement			1
" i condemn the attitude of the @entity8 regime that has blocked any progress on the establishment of a transitional government and increased violence and acts of terror against the civilian population , " he said			1
" i salute the courage and sense of responsibility of the @entity66 that has adopted a constructive position throughout the negotiations			0
" he urged those people and entities that have influence with the @entity21 government to " bring it to more quickly respect the demands of the international community			0
