-- nearly two - and - a - half years after losing the title , @entity1 reclaimed the world no. 1 golf ranking when winning the @entity5 tournament on monday			1
the defending champion knew that only victory at @entity8 would enable him to topple @entity10 's @entity9			0
with thunder storms having pushed the final round of play in @entity15 into monday , the 37 - year - old defended the three - shot lead he held at the start of the day to finish 13 under par -- two ahead of second - placed @entity19			1
can winning really take care of everything in @entity1 ' life ? " it has been a by - product of hard work , patience and getting back to winning golf tournaments , " @entity1 said of regaining the coveted top spot			1
as he tapped into the eighteenth , @entity1 became only the second golfer in history to win eight @entity33 titles at the same event -- joining the legendary @entity35 , who achieved his tally at the @entity37 ( now called the @entity37 )			1
" i play well here -- and that 's as simple as it gets , " @entity1 replied when asked the secret of his success at @entity8			2
while @entity35 needed 27 years to mark up those victories , @entity1 took just 13 -- nearly half the time -- to achieve the feat , having also managed to win three other tournaments on seven different occasions			1
the @entity49 's form suggests he will be the man to beat at next month 's masters at @entity51 , the first major of the year -- with many pundits awaiting his first major since 2008 to consider his comeback complete			0
" that 's up to them -- that 's their opinion , " said a relaxed @entity56 after his success			0
" i am very pleased with the way i am playing -- and that 's enough for me			0
" opinion : for @entity1 , winning does take care of everything the title , on one of his favorite courses , formally caps his return to the summit of golf -- which he spectacularly fell off when reports of numerous marital infidelities emerged in late 2009 , whereupon he took an indefinite break from the sport			0
the following august , his divorce from his @entity80 wife of six years , former model @entity79 , who is the mother of his two children , was finalized			0
in october 2010 , six months after returning to golf with such poor form that he failed to win a single event in a season for the first time since turning professional , @entity1 lost his world best crown to @entity90 @entity89 -- ending a record run of 281 consecutive weeks at the top ( which started in june 2005 )			1
a combination of further poor form , added to injury , meant that a man who had once seemed invincible on the golf course dropped to a barely credible 58th place in november 2011			0
but 29 months after losing his crown , @entity1 is back on top for the eleventh time in his career -- capping a fine month for both his game and private life , with the golfer having announced his relationship to skier @entity106 last week			2
he will now start to add to the record 623 weeks he has spent on top of the golfing world , a tally which is nearly double that of his nearest rival , with @entity112 @entity111 racking up 331 weeks , while no other player has broken the 100 - week barrier			1
the 2013 season may be in its infancy but the 14 - time major winner has started in irrepressible form , winning three of his five tournaments -- after triumphing at @entity121 earlier this month and at @entity122 in january			0
his 77th @entity124 victory also marked his 99th professional tournament win as @entity1 , who has won the masters on four occasions , prepares his bid to wear the famous green jacket for the first time since 2005 .			2

@entity1 returns to no. 1 spot after two - and - a - half - year *absence*
victory over @entity19 takes @entity1 to joint record eighth win at same @entity33 event
@entity1 now starts 624th week at the top of world rankings
