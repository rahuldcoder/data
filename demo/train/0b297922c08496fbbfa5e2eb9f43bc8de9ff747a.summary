@entity1 gov. @entity0 will immediately send up to 1,000 @entity3 troops to help secure the southern border , where tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors from @entity6 have crossed into the @entity7 this year in a surge that is deemed a humanitarian crisis			1
@entity0 also wants president @entity10 and @entity11 to hire an additional 3,000 border patrol agents for the @entity1 border , which would eventually replace the temporary guard forces			1
" i will not stand idly by , " @entity0 said in @entity16 monday , announcing what he called @entity18			1
" the price of inaction is too high			0
" @entity0 's state has received the majority of migrant children , especially in the @entity25 region , and he has repeatedly called on the federal government to beef up border security			1
@entity29 spokesman @entity28 said the @entity29 has not yet received the formal communication required for @entity0 to deploy guard troops			1
but he said if @entity0 follows through , he hopes those forces would be coordinated " with the significant ongoing efforts already in place			2
" on border crisis , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity0 remake image the @entity25 sector , where most of the immigrant children are turning themselves into the border patrol , has a large number of agents but it is also the largest crossing			1
it currently has 3,000 border patrol agents covering 320 miles of land and 250 miles of water , which equates to 5.4 agents per mile			0
the @entity53 sector , for instance , has approximately 15.7 agents per mile			0
both @entity0 and @entity10 have the authority to deploy @entity3 troops , but whoever authorizes it has to pay for it			1
the deployment at @entity0 's direction means @entity1 will have to pick up the price tag of $ 12 million per month			1
one border sheriff , @entity62 of @entity63 , said he is skeptical of @entity0 's plan			2
" at this time , a lot of people do things for political reasons			0
i do n't know that it helps , " he told the @entity70			0
conservatives largely point to border security as their top immigration priority and @entity0 has been an outspoken proponent of securing the border since the influx of immigrants began			1
is the immigration crisis @entity0 's second act ? the potential 2016 presidential candidate previewed his plan in @entity81 over the weekend in a television interview while campaigning for @entity84 candidates			1
he has used the issue to remake his image on immigration			0
his previous @entity29 campaign was crippled partly because of a law he signed giving children of undocumented immigrants in - state college tuition			0
@entity10 asked for $ 3.7 billion in emergency funds to address the influx of young immigrants , which has n't gained much traction in @entity11			2
it includes money to fortify the border			2
the @entity29 and @entity98 are working on their own plan , which includes a controversial proposal to change a law that prohibits the youth , mostly from @entity103 , @entity104 , and @entity105 , from being immediately deported			0
the @entity10 administration questioned @entity0 's motives since many of the minors are not trying to evade the border patrol but are turning themselves in after crossing the border			1
children at the border : what 's happening and why but @entity0 said the guard will be " force multipliers , " helping @entity118 agents both on the ground and in the air to catch the 80 % of people crossing the border who are n't children and to combat cartel and trafficking crime			1
" you can not have ( national security ) without border security , " @entity0 said			1
while the number of unaccompanied youth crossing the border has doubled to nearly 60,000 in the past year , the total number of undocumented immigrants has mostly declined			2
about 1 million people have been caught crossing the border nearly every year between 1983 until 2006 , but that number has dropped to about 400,000 in 2013			0
at the same time , resources for border security have steadily increased : more than 18,000 agents patrolled the border in 2013 compared to 10,000 a decade ago			2
and the amount spent on border security has more than doubled			2
the @entity118 and @entity145 budget jumped from $ 5 billion in 2002 to $ 12.4 billion this year			0
the issue has hit a national nerve			0
protests have erupted along the border with activists demanding immediate deportation			0
counter protests have also erupted , pointing out that many of the migrants are said to have fled violence at home			0
protesters vent anger at ' alien invasion ' of the @entity7			0
