@entity0 -- two @entity3 security guards photographed sleeping on the job have been fired , according to the @entity6 and @entity7			1
two @entity3 guards were fired for their on - the - job siestas			1
a bicycle tour operator who commutes daily over the bridge from @entity7 to @entity0 snapped photos of the two guards on different occasions , and the photos were published on a @entity7 local news web site			2
in one set of photographs by commuter @entity21 , taken during a wednesday rush hour at 7:15 a.m. , a guard tilts his head downward and dozes			1
the other snoozer 's on - the - clock siesta is more brazen : he uses his arm as a pillow as he dozes at 10:15 a.m. last monday			0
before releasing the photos , @entity21 hesitated , knowing it would likely cost the guards their jobs			1
but ultimately he decided the security of thousands outweighed the job security of two			0
" if there 's two people on this bridge who do n't care about my safety and the safety of anybody who comes over this bridge , then i really do n't have an obligation to withhold what i have , " he said			0
given the @entity3 's iconic status and huge traffic volume , officials have long cited it as a potential terrorist target			0
@entity21 said he was moved to photograph the slumbering sentries after witnessing the same guard napping on three occasions			1
" the first time i shrugged it off and said , ' i ca n't believe he 's sleeping , ' " said @entity21			1
" the second time i was very annoyed			0
third time -- that 's it			0
" @entity21 said he later approached the guard , told him he had caught him asleep at his post three times , and said he had the photos to prove it			1
the profusely apologetic guard vowed it would not happen again			0
three weeks later , it did happen again , but this time with a different guard , according to @entity21			2
instead of discreetly taking photos from a distance , an indignant @entity21 marched up to the guard 's booth and snapped away			1
the guard did not stir			0
the sleeping guards were employees of @entity72 , a security contractor used by the @entity6 , which operates the @entity3 along with all other bridges leading into @entity74			1
in a statement , the @entity6 sought to assure commuters it views security as an issue of utmost importance , and urged people to report holes they notice in its defenses			2
" the @entity6 takes the safety of its passengers and facilities very seriously and has spent more than $ 4 billion on security since 9/11			2
the @entity6 welcomes the public 's vigilance on matters of safety and security and we encourage our customers to contact us if they encounter anything out of the ordinary , " the agency said			2
although the guards ' names were not released , the @entity6 said in its statement , " the two guards have been fired by the security contractor , @entity72			1
" @entity72 did not respond to @entity1 's calls for comment			0
@entity103 , a @entity1 contributor and former @entity106 homeland security adviser , called the guards ' naps a serious lapse			0
" it is unacceptable , particularly given the experience the @entity6 had with 9/11 , " she said , referring to the @entity6 's role as the operator of the @entity112 .			0
