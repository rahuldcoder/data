-- @entity1 overpowered @entity2 to win the @entity4 final at @entity4 for the first time and complete a career grand slam			1
the 2012 tournament 's surprise package , @entity10 never came up with an answer to @entity1 's strategy of power and unerring ball placement as the @entity15 produced 37 winner to secure a 6 - 3 6 - 3 victory			1
as @entity1 motored into a 4 - 0 lead in the opening set the final looked as it might be over in the blink of an eye , but @entity10 got her toe in the match by breaking @entity1 's serve to win the fifth game			1
@entity10 , who is ranked 23rd in the world , showed plenty of grit to save two set points in the eighth game , but when a third set point came up in the following game @entity1 ruthlessly converted			2
@entity32 's @entity10 refused to capitulate in the second set , but was never able to threaten the @entity15 's dominance			2
as well as strength , @entity1 's quickness of feet was a feature of an impressive performance , notably when she sprinted to reach an @entity10 drop shot , winning the point to take a 4 - 1 lead			1
@entity10 saved two match points in a game that the @entity32 produced a couple of the deftest drop shots you could wish for , but the @entity32 's resistance was finally ended when the @entity15 converted her third championship point			2
it was the 25 - year - old @entity15 's first grand slam title since she won the @entity51 in 2008			1
since then @entity1 's career has been hampered by serious shoulder injuries that forced her into a long rehab , but her winning form at @entity4 will also see the @entity15 move above @entity58 @entity57 to take the no. 1 ranking slot on monday			1
saturday 's victory ensured @entity1 became just the 10th female player to complete a career grand slam to emulate the the likes of greats such as @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
the @entity15 won her first grand slam title at @entity72 eight years ago , before going on to win the @entity73 in 2006 and then then @entity51 four years ago			1
" it 's the most incredible feeling , " said @entity1 after her win in @entity75			1
" i 'm so happy			0
i 've worked so hard for this -- it took a lot to get to this stage and even more to win it			0
there are so many tough days where you feel like giving up , but you do n't			0
it 's been such a journey to get to this stage again			0
" if @entity10 's impressive performances at @entity4 -- featuring wins over two former champions and two members of the top 10 -- might not have had a fairytale ending , those rankings will provide some consolation for the @entity32 as she enters the top 10 for the first time			1
" i do n't feel like top 10 , but i will be top 10 , and it 's incredible for me , " said @entity10 , who made only only hit 11 unforced errors during the final			2
" i really ca n't believe it			0
i 'm so happy for everything right now			0
" @entity101 made a point of praising @entity10 's achievement in reaching the final			2
" what an amazing tournament , " said the @entity15			0
" i 've watched you play the last two weeks and the way you 've performed			0
and the way you played today was extremely difficult for me			0
i know it was our first meeting , and i hope we play many more times			0
