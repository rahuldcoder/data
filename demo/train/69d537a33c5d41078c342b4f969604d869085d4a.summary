i have always romanticized the family ski vacation -- that 's before i actually started skiing with my own children			1
what no one warns you about is that skiing with young kids can suck the relaxation right out of you			2
i am the ski sherpa , schlepping my kids ' boots , skis and poles , as hand warmers and granola bars bulge from my pockets			1
by the time i get to the slopes , even in the midst of a @entity19 , i am sweating right through my @entity21 long underwear			2
welcome to @entity22 and the @entity24 family ski trip of 2014			1
my kids are pumped to be in @entity22 , home to several @entity27 athletes , and the @entity28 have just kicked off			2
the conditions are fabulous , with snow dumping at an exceptional rate			2
after a day of lessons , both of my kids are officially better skiers than i. and i am wiped			2
my thighs are aching from plowing through the 20 inches of fresh powder			2
it was glorious ; i 'm just pooped			2
if it were n't for my debilitating headache at 10,000 feet , a cocktail would be in order			1
but alas , it 's @entity42 and legalized weed has given après ski a new meaning -- so i start weighing my options			1
when you are traveling with precocious tween kids who are super judgy about any type of smoking and recoil from the stench of beer , how do you even broach the subject of marijuana ? mommy needs her glass of wine is now mommy needs her hit of weed ? it feels wrong , but maybe that 's why it 's so exciting to even contemplate			0
still , my kids are not sophisticated enough to understand the nuances or subtleties of life or why parents do what they do to relax and reinvigorate			1
there are some things they just do n't need to know , and i decide this is one of them			1
at their age , it 's probably best to keep it black and white			0
drugs , drinking and sex are all bad -- very bad ! i considered drawing others into my quest for the green stuff			0
we were staying at the gorgeous , new @entity86 luxury residences in @entity22			0
i was assigned a concierge named @entity88 to do everything from stock my fridge to schedule my son 's snowmobiling adventure			0
could i also ask @entity88 to hook me up with pot ? i felt like i was 16 years old again , trying to score some wine coolers			1
it may be legal , but it still seemed illicit			1
i could n't bring myself to ask @entity88 , but i did check the weed situation with @entity98 , my awesome ski instructor who also happens to be the former mayor of @entity22			1
they wear many hats in this town			0
@entity98 confirmed that the @entity22 is pot - free and smoking on their magnificent mountain is illegal			1
it 's federal land and lighting up outside is a big no - no. they take it seriously in @entity22 -- i get it			0
no one wants stoned skiers near themselves or their kids			0
but i would argue that boozing boarders are just as scary and there 's no shortage of alcohol at ski resorts in @entity119			1
so while weed was n't for sale anywhere in @entity123 , a quick @entity125 search and a click on the @entity128 app turned up a half - dozen dispensaries within an hour 's drive			1
in @entity42 you can ski a bowl in @entity22 and smoke a bowl in @entity134 , all in a few hours			1
the @entity136 folks may scoff at that tagline , not wanting to sully the sophisticated image of @entity42 skiing , but it could be a boon for the industry			1
@entity142 has @entity143 ; @entity42 has @entity144			1
and after a day of hard skiing , you may just want to skip the @entity146 and relax with a tasty pot edible instead			1
with my husband 's enthusiastic support , i went in search of the @entity151 in @entity134			0
it felt a little stealth as i told my kids that mommy needed to run a few errands before @entity157			0
so i cranked up some tunes in my rental minivan and hit @entity160 to downtown @entity134 , where the marijuana market is nestled along the picturesque main street across from a @entity163			0
after consulting the @entity151 's petite , blonde , 20 - something budtender -- that 's what they call themselves - i bought a $ 25 chocolate chip cranberry " lucie in the @entity174 " cookie and some @entity172 - infused chocolate truffles in a shiny , silver package			0
i considered the gummies , but the chocolate seemed more festive			0
a couple of doors down , i found a fancy candy store for my kids			0
chocolate - covered strawberries for my children , @entity172 chocolate truffles for my man -- happy @entity157 ! even though it was all perfectly legit , i felt a little giddy			1
old habits , i suppose			0
at night after the kids were asleep , my husband and i nibbled on the jumbo cookie and watched some @entity27 slopestyle , waiting for @entity191 to work her magic			0
she was to be my masseuse - by - pot - proxy , easing my tired and aching body into a blissful , peaceful state			1
after all , i never can break away to a spa on a family ski trip			1
it 's too time consuming and it 's tough to grab an alone moment when we are away			0
but @entity191 , well , she 's conveniently sitting on my nightstand waiting to be appreciated			0
we made sure to keep @entity191 locked in our bedroom so as not to confuse her with my kids ' cookies in the kitchen			0
earlier , my budtender warned me to only eat a quarter of the cookie , but i must have consumed more than was recommended because the next eight hours turned into a heart - racing , chest - thumping , head - spinning trip			2
the potency of edibles is apparently unreliable , and they can pack a punch			0
who knew ? the next morning after some strong coffee , i was back in the heated , @entity221 gondola , not only happy that i could finally stand , but psyched to squeeze in a few more hours of @entity22 powder before the trek back @entity224			0
my @entity172 cookie did n't give me the relaxing zen that i was hoping to have , but i did n't regret the experience			2
next time i could do without the heart palpitations and pay closer attention to my budtender 's recommendations			0
perhaps the oatmeal raisin cookie would have been mellower			0
a week later , my kids were still talking about the 50,000 - plus vertical feet they shredded as recorded on their handy @entity236 app. as for me and my chocolate truffles , it 's illegal to transport any form of cannabis over state lines			2
those weed amnesty drop boxes popping up at airports around the state are probably getting a lot of action , and not just from stoners			2
@entity42 skiing has always been known for its @entity249 and blue skies ; now après ski gives the family ski trip a whole new high			1
parents , weigh in below : while on a trip with the kids , would you use pot to relax -- the same way you might have a drink after the kids are asleep ?			1

@entity24 wanted to try using pot to relax during a family vacation in @entity42
@entity144 is legal in the state , and she looked up a local dispensary for *supplies*
@entity269 kept her children in the dark about it ; they are n't old enough to understand
the high was n't all she hoped , but it lent a new *aspect* to the *traditional* family ski trip
