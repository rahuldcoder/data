@entity1 leaders are furious with @entity2			1
yet again they have to go back to their electorates asking for more billions to throw down the black hole that is the @entity2			2
they have now become so angry that they are even openly proposing that @entity2 's fiscal affairs be deferred to some @entity10 commissioner , preferably one of a @entity12 disposition			1
@entity2 leaders , meanwhile , have seized upon this @entity1 " transgression " with glee			1
for it offers them a wonderful excuse to put on domestic display their patriotic fervor at a time when they are running low on legitimacy in the eyes of a battered , demoralized electorate			0
beating their chests about the @entity1 threat to @entity2 's national sovereignty , they are hoping that the @entity2 will somehow forget that it was they , their leaders , who ceded sovereignty to the so - called troika of the @entity33 , the @entity34 and the @entity35			1
this is a typical case of a shady coalition of vested interests that is disintegrating under the weight of its collective hubris			0
for the past 18 months , @entity1 and @entity2 leaders have been working together to deny the truth about three simultaneous bankruptcies : the irreversible bankruptcy of the @entity2 state , the effective insolvency of many @entity48 - @entity1 banks , and , last but not least , the unsustainability of the euro - system as we know it			1
to keep these truths from surfacing , @entity1 and @entity2 politicians , each for their own purposes , settled on gigantic loans for @entity2 that would act as plaster on the festering wounds of the aforementioned bankruptcies			1
but to get these " historic " loans through the parliaments of @entity62 and @entity63 , they had to be portrayed as a form of humanism ; as @entity1 solidarity to the @entity2 people			1
alas , to extend such " solidarity , " @entity1 lawmakers demanded subsidiarity ; which is euro - speak for the recipient agreeing to a tough reform agenda , complete with strict fiscal targets			2
in plain language , the huge loans would only be granted if similarly lofty promises were made by the @entity2 government			2
thus , @entity1 leaders , unwilling to confront their bankers and the fault lines developing throughout the eurozone , pretended to believe that the problem was @entity2 and that @entity2 could be " cured " by means of loans and austerity			1
at the same time , @entity2 leaders , unwilling to confront their electorate , pretended to believe that they could deliver the targets demanded by @entity1			1
of course , it was only a matter of time before reality caught up with both sets of leaders			0
once it became abundantly clear that the targets @entity2 had committed to were well and truly unrealistic , the coalition between our @entity1 and @entity2 leaders became testy			1
the knives are out and , if it were not for an equilibrium of terror at the thought of a euro - system collapse , a disorderly brawl would be plain for all to see			0
the worst part of this sad saga is that public debate is still failing to keep track with the real issues			2
instead of coming to terms with the structural imbalances within the eurozone , the @entity1 accuse the @entity2 of incompetence , corruption and a singular failure to meet " their " targets			1
the @entity2 , meanwhile , are replying with references to @entity120 and yelps of horror at the prospect of violations of national sovereignty			0
neither side is willing to admit that the whole rescue package was flawed from the outset			2
no serious consideration is given to the plain facts : that the cascade of insolvencies in the eurozone should never have been treated like liquidity problems fixable by loans to the bankrupt banks and states			0
that it is always a terrible idea to make large loans to an already shrinking economy conditional on further reduction in the national income from which these loans must be repaid ( for this is precisely what hefty austerity measures in the middle of a recession achieve )			0
that @entity2 's agreed targets would be equivalent to my promising , perhaps under duress , to break the world 100 - meter sprint record in the forthcoming @entity153			1
the punishment of any big lie is its revelation			0
unfortunately , we are not there yet			0
the preordained failure of the @entity2 " program " has not yet exposed our leaders ' connivance			0
it is , instead , generating @entity12 wrath among the hard working @entity1 ( whose living standards have been under constant pressure for a decade , and who are now told they must guarantee even more zillions for the @entity2 state ) and unbearable sisyphean pain for @entity2 caught up in a vicious cycle ( from which no amount of hard work or innovative thinking can help them escape )			2
if it is not our leaders ' insidious lie , it will be the eurozone			0
it 's that simple .			0

@entity1 and @entity2 politicians are at odds over who should control @entity2 's *budget*
@entity2 political economist @entity186 says both are *guilty* of failing to grasp the real problem
@entity186 says both countries *mislead* voters in agreeing an unsustainable rescue package for @entity2
