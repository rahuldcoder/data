when is a can of beans more than just a can of beans ? when it 's a weapon of self - defense for students to throw at an armed intruder who has just entered their school			1
that 's one scenario @entity13 , @entity14 , officials are considering as part of their training to respond to school shootings			1
though it may strike some as an insignificant and perhaps even silly response to a deadly problem , it 's no joke at @entity22			2
it 's part of active shooter response training offered by the @entity24 , a company founded by a former police officer and former elementary school principal			1
school officials have gotten some criticism for sending a letter to parents asking students to bring canned goods to attack would - be intruders			1
" we realize at first this may seem odd ; however , it is a practice that would catch an intruder off - guard , " the letter reads , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity35			0
" the canned food item could stun the intruder or even knock him out until the police arrive			0
the canned food item will give the students a sense of empowerment to protect themselves and will make them feel secure in case an intruder enters the classroom			2
" @entity49 superintendent @entity48 acknowledges that the middle school did n't educate people properly before sending the letter home , but she says the cans are a very small part of the training			2
" the major point of the training ( which is called @entity60 , lockdown , inform , counter , and evacuate ) is to be able to get kids evacuated and not be sitting ducks hiding under desks , " @entity48 wrote in an email			0
even if you ca n't escape and are barricaded behind closed doors to avoid the shooter , there are still steps to take to increase your safety , suggests an @entity74 video			0
@entity74 is providing the training to the school district			1
once the door has been locked and barricaded and students have moved to an area out of sight , students should have a plan if the attacker breaks into the room			2
that 's when canned goods and other classroom items come into play			1
" start gathering several items you can use to protect yourself			0
every room has something you can use to distract and defend from the aggressors ' attack , " says the @entity74 video 's narrator			0
" communicate with others around you and tell them your plan			0
do n't wait until the aggressor gets into your safe area to have a plan of action			0
" students can throw books , book bags , computers and , yes , those canned goods to distract any aggressor .			1

@entity14 students were asked to bring canned goods for school security
cans or other heavy items could be used to fight school shooters
it 's part of a *larger* school district plan to empower students
