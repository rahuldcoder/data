going to the @entity0 has been dangerous for @entity1			1
for two years , the actress could n't seem to stay upright at the event , tripping once in 2013 when walking to the stage to accept her @entity0 for " @entity5 , " and then falling again when arriving for the ceremony this march			1
so is @entity7 really that accident - prone , or are her repeat tumbles some sort of scheme to become more relatable , and thus more likable ? well if it is a plot , @entity7 tells @entity13 in its june issue , she 'd be smarter about executing it			1
at the @entity16 , @entity7 says she was " trying to do the right thing " as she got out of her limo			0
she was " waving to fans , trying to be nice , and there 's a traffic cone , " she recalls			1
" the second i hit it , i was laughing , but on the inside i was like , ' you 're f * * * * d. they 're totally going to think this is an act ... ' but trust me if i was going to plan it , i would have done it at the @entity32 or the @entity33			0
i would have never done it at two oscars in a row			0
i watch ' homeland ' -- i 'm craftier than that ! " that kind of answer is exactly the reason fans adore @entity7 ; she 's uber - talented but also down - to - earth enough to freak out on a reporter who spoiled the last season of " @entity37			1
" yet the @entity45 - bred star insists that becoming famous has worn off some of her @entity47 charm , telling @entity13 that these days , she 's " a lot more closed off and frankly probably rude			1
" " i mean , i 'm from @entity45			0
i used to be very personable and make eye contact and smile at people , and now all i do is look down , " the 23 - year - old says			2
" when i 'm at dinner and one person after another keeps interrupting to take pictures , it 's like , ' i ca n't live like this			2
' " but one thing @entity7 has learned to live with is a long - distance relationship			0
both the actress and her boyfriend , " x-men : @entity70 " co-star @entity63 , are busy building their careers , and they 've agreed it 's ok to " mutually ignore each other " for a bit when necessary			1
" neither of us gets mad when the other does n't text back or call			0
life 's super-busy , " the actress says			1
" obviously you know what they 're doing , and you trust them			0
we 're so young that it would almost be like if we lived in the same city , what would happen ? we 'd be living together			0
at least this way he 's in the same boat as i am : we can go out and have our own lives and know that we have each other			2
" it 's not an overstatement that @entity7 keeps a busy schedule ; for the next two years she 's committed to wrapping up " @entity97 " franchise with " @entity96 " parts 1 and 2 , plus filming another " x-men " movie , " x-men : @entity105 , " all of which comes on the heels of the highly touted @entity103 movie " @entity104			2
" the latter earned @entity7 another raft of praise and an @entity0 nomination for best supporting actress , a nod that some prognosticators thought she might cinch			1
in the end , the gold went to " @entity116 " actress @entity115 , and @entity7 says she could n't have been more thrilled			2
" i was very happy i voted for @entity117 , " @entity7 said			0
" it 's beautiful when you watch something good happen to somebody when it 's well deserved			0
