@entity0 -- @entity5 's consul general in @entity6 has been declared to be persona non grata and must leave the @entity8 , a @entity3 spokesman said sunday			1
spokesman @entity9 declined to comment on specific details behind the decision to expel @entity12 , who has headed @entity5 's consulate in @entity6 since march 2011			1
the @entity14 in @entity0 was informed of the decision friday , @entity9 said in a written statement , and the @entity3 said @entity17 must depart the @entity8 by tuesday			1
it was unclear sunday whether or not she was still in the @entity8			2
there was no immediate response from the @entity14 government			1
last month , a group of @entity25 lawmakers said they had " grave concerns " about @entity17 and called for an investigation after the @entity28 - language tv channel @entity27 aired a documentary alleging that she was among a group of @entity14 and @entity33 diplomats who expressed interest in an offer from a group of @entity38 hackers to infiltrate the websites of the @entity40 , the @entity41 , the @entity42 and @entity8 nuclear plants			1
the evidence that the plot was real , according to @entity27 , are secret recordings with diplomats who ask questions about what the hackers can do and promise to send information to their governments			0
@entity27 interviewed a purported @entity38 whistle - blower -- a student at the @entity56 named @entity57			0
the student told @entity27 he was recruited by a leftist professor who wanted to wage cyber attacks on the @entity8 and its allies			2
@entity61 told @entity27 he secretly recorded a meeting in 2008 with @entity17 , who was then the cultural attache of the @entity14 in @entity38			1
according to a recording @entity27 aired as part of its report , @entity17 is heard saying that she can send the information gathered by the hackers straight to @entity14 president @entity69			2
@entity69 has called the report " lies			0
" one of the @entity33 diplomats told @entity27 that although he , indeed , was presented with a hacking plot by the @entity38 group , he turned it down , in part because he thought they were @entity76 agents			0
in a letter to @entity8 secretary of state @entity79 last month , reps			0
@entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 asked the @entity3 to require @entity17 's " immediate departure " from the @entity8 if the @entity27 report proved true			1
@entity80 , who is chairwoman of the @entity86 , cheered the decision to declare @entity88 on sunday , but said the @entity8 must do more to " counter @entity33 plots in the @entity90			1
" @entity33 president @entity94 is on a four - nation @entity25 tour this week , a visit the @entity93 @entity92 said serves " as a somber reminder that our enemies are welcomed by our undemocratic neighbors			0
" " we must strengthen our regional alliances to confront the onslaught of anti-democratic forces in @entity25 whose goal is to undermine our nation , " @entity80 said			0
a @entity3 spokesman said last month that the @entity8 did not know about the alleged plot , but that it found the @entity27 allegations " very disturbing			2
" however , " we do n't have any information , at this point , to corroborate it , " @entity3 spokesman @entity110 said			0
@entity1 's @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 contributed to this report .			0
