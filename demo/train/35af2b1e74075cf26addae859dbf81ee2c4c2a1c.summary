-- let us not doubt , even in the age of deep cynicism , the power of words can still stir the spirit			1
and let us acknowledge , whatever our politics , that president @entity8 has redefined oratory for our times , and perhaps more , revived it			2
not all of his speeches are memorable			2
his talk on the 50th anniversary of the 1963 march on @entity15 fell short			0
not all of his remarks inspire thoughtful reflection , initiate critical debate or compel us to move forward			0
in some ways , his second inaugural speech was a missed opportunity			0
but when he is focused , when the moment and its meaning coalesce , no president since @entity25 matches @entity8 's ability to transform ideas into phrases , and phrases into the passion to be a force for progress			1
i give president @entity36 and president @entity37 their due			0
magnificent speakers and eloquent in their convictions , both in their time elevated the stature of presidential speeches			0
@entity8 , though , as he proved in his eulogy for @entity47 , can be in a league of his own			1
let me first deal with -- or rather dismiss -- the gossipy flutter over @entity8 's handshake with @entity51 , president of @entity52 and @entity54 's brother			1
as @entity0 reported , it happened in the context of @entity8 's shaking hands with dozens of world leaders			2
respect for @entity47 and his family required @entity8 to be polite			1
as @entity0 foreign affairs correspondent @entity64 wrote , " refusing to shake @entity54 's hand would not have been in keeping with @entity47 's legacy of reconciliation			1
" there are times when all of us can be critical of president @entity8			2
after all , he 's not infallible			0
his speech at @entity47 's memorial was beyond my expectations			1
i watched as more than 100 world leaders walked into the stadium where @entity76 had gathered to celebrate @entity47 's life			1
they took their seats to applause			0
@entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 leaders sat together , so they could talk amongst themselves , i guess			0
it was an interesting juxtaposition since they were there to honor a man who brought people of different colors and backgrounds together			0
but when @entity8 spoke , i became lifted from the drizzle and dim light			2
@entity8 's words made me proud as an @entity81 and as a person ; they resurrected @entity47 's spirit			1
it is because of @entity47 's soul , his spirit , that so many gathered			1
@entity47 's spirit was present within each person who was there			1
it was reflected in the hope that was palpable even across the miles and through a television screen			0
@entity47 , a man of persistence , forgiveness , decency , struggle and strength , has left an overwhelming legacy as reflected in the faces of those in attendance , from the pauper to the world leader			2
we all know there is nothing easier to overdo than a eulogy			0
it is so tempting , in the graciousness of not speaking to human errors because they are gone , to lay it on so thick that the deceased , if he could , would look around and say , " who is he talking about ? " @entity8 avoided that trap			2
it was because @entity47 showed us his human traits in all their mix that we came to love the man , he said			0
he also showed us that a human being , though weighted by faults , can rise to the greatest heights of the human spirit			0
as @entity8 reminded us , " there is a word in @entity76 -- ubuntu -- that describes [ @entity47 's ] greatest gift : his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that can be invisible to the eye ; that there is a oneness to humanity ; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others , and caring for those around us			1
" @entity8 also hit the hypocrisy in all of us , but especially in world leaders ( including himself , he said ) who would praise @entity47 but then not walk the walk that @entity47 walked			1
twenty - seven years in prison would have killed many a person 's hopes			0
at some point , most would have thought , " i 'll never get out , my dreams are gone			0
" while social media was gossiping about @entity8 shaking hands with @entity54 , @entity8 chastised leaders who would praise @entity47 's racial reconciliation yet oppose the most modest reforms to end economic injustice and inequality			1
and speaking to the heads of authoritarian governments present , @entity8 said there were too many leaders who " claim solidarity with freedom , " but do not " tolerate dissent from their own people			0
" @entity8 spoke of @entity47 's uniqueness as the last great liberator of the 20th century			1
@entity47 's special qualities should inspire us to make our own imprint for the continuing struggle of equality , reconciliation and freedom			1
" while i will always fall short of @entity47 's example , he makes me want to be a better man			1
he speaks to what is best inside us , " @entity8 said			0
thank you , mr. president , for words and a spirit befitting the occasion			2
