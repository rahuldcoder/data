-- watching digital artist @entity4 's stunning photo - realistic @entity2 paintings emerge from a blank screen is an awe - inspiring experience			1
the image of @entity8 in the video above , created from a picture by @entity11 , is so rich in detail that it is difficult to believe that you are n't looking at a photograph			2
difficult until you see the brush strokes build from a blank canvas and turn into the @entity20 - nominated actor before your very eyes			1
@entity4 is a @entity23 - based visual artist who specializes in creating visually striking paintings and illustrations for film , television , advertising and print			1
@entity4 says that his work combines his " passion for art , technology and storytelling			0
" the @entity23 artist originally trained as an oil painter , but today has an extensive list of clients including @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity43			0
according to @entity4 there is n't much difference between working on a tablet and conventional painting , except that after you are done you can watch the creative process back : " the advantage to using @entity52 on the @entity2 is that you can create really high resolution artwork and the process of creating it can then be automatically exported as a video , " @entity4 says			1
" the user interface is nice and simple which means you can quickly select brushes and colours without interrupting your thought process			0
the only disadvantage about working on a touch screen is that you have choose between using your fingers or a whole host of stylus choices			0
personally i have become used to painting in on the @entity2 with my finger			2
this helps the interchange between pinching to zoom and navigate the painting and then tapping to paint			0
" most of @entity4 's work is done on an @entity75 but when he is away from his desktop , @entity4 uses his sketchbook , @entity77 , @entity77 and @entity2			2
according to the artist , the image of @entity8 above required 285,000 brush strokes and more than 200 hours to complete			1
@entity4 painted the work over a few weeks in november before posting the video this week			0

in 2011 , @entity4 was ' @entity86 ' at the @entity87 , where he delivered a talk about digital artwork and gave live demonstrations			2
