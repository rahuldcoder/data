-- there is no better way to ring in the spring season than with a free pass to the carefree days of childhood when no one could chastise you for a well - executed prank -- as long as it brought a smile to both parties			2
you may choose to privately celebrate @entity13 by covering your office toilet seat in saran wrap or telling your mom you 're engaged to a death metal drummer			1
or you may celebrate publicly , if you live in one of the @entity20 cities that host festivities			1
in @entity23 , revelers can dress up in outlandish outfits and participate in the @entity25			0
@entity26 can run the " @entity30 " through @entity27 or attend the @entity28 , which has been announced for the last 26 years , but never taken place			0
but if you want to take your pranking abroad , there are other countries that do tomfoolery even better than @entity20			0
here 's a destination guide for the ultimate purveyor of mischief			1
@entity38 many sources claim april fools ' began in @entity38 after @entity41 decreed that all citizens must begin their calendar on january 1 , moving the start of the year back by three months			1
therefore , those who celebrated around the beginning of april were deemed foolish			1
considering there are earlier mentions of the holiday , this origin story is a little fishy			0
but the @entity38 celebration is even fishier			1
the day itself is called @entity51 , as pranksters attempt to attach paper poisson ( fish ) to unsuspecting fools ' backs			1
perhaps the most enjoyable tradition of this holiday is all the fish - shaped treats and pastries that fill bakeries and chocolate shops			0
@entity64 if you 're a true gowk hunter , then you should head to @entity64 , as their april fools ' celebrations last for two days			1
@entity68 the @entity67 is celebrated on april 1			1
" @entity67 " is @entity64 for " cuckold " or " fool , " and the goal of the day is to hunt them out and make them aware of their foolishness			1
the traditional prank of this day revolves around making someone go on a fool 's errand			2
and while day one is dedicated to making someone the butt of a joke , day two is all about making a joke out of someone 's bum			1
april 2 is @entity87 , when you 're not only allowed , but encouraged , to focus your attention on the posteriors of others			2
the infamous " kick me " sign most likely originated as an early @entity87 joke			0
@entity96 the @entity96 celebrate their version of april fools ' on december 28 , so you have plenty of time to plan			1
@entity101 ­ a de @entity102 is a @entity103 holiday dedicated to the remembrance of the " @entity105 " who were killed when @entity107 ordered the death of baby boys in @entity110 after hearing that he was going to lose his throne to the newborn @entity112 , according to the @entity113			2
yes , pranks to commemorate the mass slaughter of infants			0
the fool of each prank is considered an inocente , and after the prank is made , the prankster shouts the phrase to let him know he 's been had			2
if you really want to make the most of the day , celebrate in the town of @entity125 , @entity126 , which hosts the @entity128 festival that has taken place for two centuries			1
participants partake in a mock coup d'etat that culminates with one of the world 's largest food fights when everyone takes to the streets with flour and eggs			2
mock soldiers run around in the bedlam , collecting " taxes " that go to charity			0
@entity144 @entity144 gets the award for most vibrant custom , with their @entity148 holiday , @entity149			0
also known as the @entity149 , this celebration takes place on the last full moon day of winter , someday in february or march			0
the next @entity149 takes place on march 27 , 2013			0
all across the country , participants take to the streets , playing pranks and throwing colorful , scented powder at each other			0
in this bacchanalia that gives you an idea of what it would look like if a @entity168 factory exploded , the social structure and norms are n't as black - and - white as they are throughout the rest of the year			0
no one is expected to be polite when they 're expecting to be blasted in the face with a handful of rainbow dust			0
but along with chaos , this tradition induces a national sense of exhilaration truly fitting for the beginning of spring			0
the holiday is exceptionally more exuberant in the northern @entity144			0
some of the best cities to celebrate are @entity184 and @entity185 ; @entity186 ; and @entity187 , @entity188			2
@entity189 although the nation itself does n't show great enthusiasm for @entity13 , the port city of @entity191 more than makes up for it with @entity196 -- a festival of humor			1
on april 1 , the city erupts with parades , concerts , plays , art , fireworks , costumed locals and pranks galore			2
@entity20 might go out of their way to confuse a friend or coworker , but since @entity196 was created in 1973 , @entity209 have proven themselves as some of the most creative and dedicated pranksters in the world .			1

in @entity38 and @entity64 , pranksters often attach things to a *victim* 's back
