-- the story of @entity2 is the story of all that has been wrong -- and continues to be wrong -- with the @entity4 and our allies ' campaign against @entity9 extremism			1
during 2004 , @entity2 had fought for @entity10 in @entity11 against the @entity4			1
indeed , he became famous as the first suicide bomber in @entity11 to survive his attack			0
known as the " living suicide , " @entity2 was rehabilitated , both physically and mentally , at a @entity16 hospital before being repatriated to his home country of @entity18			2
i met @entity2 at the @entity18 government center also designed to rehabilitate jihadi militants			2
@entity2 and @entity22 became friends			2
we spent several days together and continued a correspondence for years after i left @entity18 , until @entity2 went back to @entity26 and @entity11 to join the @entity27 ( @entity28 )			1
@entity2 had been the poster child of the " reformed " jihadi			2
he told me of his fondness for the @entity4 doctors and medics who nursed him back to health after suffering extensive burns from his bomb attack			0
given ample funds and help finding a job by the @entity18 government , everything was seemingly taken care of ; @entity2 was a terrorist no more			0
but what both the @entity18 and @entity4 who tried to " rehabilitate " @entity2 never addressed was the only thing that mattered to him			1
and that was his deep and abiding religious belief			0
above all else , @entity2 wanted to be a good muslim , devout and steadfast to the principles of @entity49			1
many @entity50 consider being a martyr in holy war -- going to heaven to fight for the faithful -- the purest path to the truest faith			0
when the war in @entity26 and now @entity11 began again , it was @entity2 's faith that drove him			1
among young muslims in the @entity63 , @entity64 and even the @entity65 , their faith has become a race to the fundamentalist finish line			1
whoever offers the purest @entity49 -- the real and most devout faith these young men seek -- will win the race			1
no amount of jobs , money or friendship with @entity4 matters			0
and no amount of @entity4 military force will ultimately matter either			1
take the story of @entity2 again			2
the @entity4 defeated him and his group @entity10 in @entity11 some seven years ago			1
@entity2 was even the paragon of a successfully rehabilitated terrorist			0
and here we are fighting the same group again , for @entity28 is largely @entity10 in @entity11 reconstituted and re-energized , with @entity2 and many men like him their holy warriors once more			1
what can the @entity4 do ? we must first recognize that this is not primarily a war between the @entity4 and radical @entity49			1
it is a war within @entity49 itself for the soul of the faith			2
until @entity50 and @entity49 religious authorities in @entity18 and elsewhere can offer a true and convincing vision of @entity49 to young men such as @entity2 , we will lose the battle for their souls			1
this is not an @entity4 government battle			0
by making it so , the @entity4 government will continue this fight for years , if not decades , as president @entity102 concedes			2
an effective response against extremism can only come from @entity50 themselves			0
what can the @entity4 do ? we are not powerless			0
whenever @entity4 national security is directly threatened , a limited use of @entity4 military power can be warranted , but only if is secondary and in support of effective local @entity49 governments and local forces in the region			1
we can not lead , as the president is undertaking now			0
we can , however , help to expose the feckless nature of the radicals			0
in 2011 , @entity4 authorities killed the radical @entity9 cleric @entity118 with a drone strike in @entity120			1
@entity121 allegedly inspired the @entity123 bombers			0
if the @entity4 had disseminated the facts about @entity118 instead -- the cleric had been arrested for soliciting prostitutes in @entity126 , a violation of @entity49 precepts -- that may have accomplished more to discredit his religious standing among young men looking for an example of @entity49 than turning him into a martyr			1
similarly , of the more than 100 @entity9 radicals i 've interviewed , the most prevalent reason they expressed for leaving the radical cause was its " un-islamic ways			2
" corruption being the key			0
exposing the illicit oil trade of the @entity142 , as well as its smuggling and narcotics trafficking could do more to defeat the group than all the drones in the world			0
but while the @entity4 can help expose their corruption , it must be up to @entity50 themselves to expose how and why their ideas are not the true and purest @entity49			1
thirteen years after 9/11 , it 's time @entity4 wakes up			2
this is not our war			0
let 's stop fighting it			0
@entity2 tells us no less .			0

@entity160 : @entity2 's story shows what 's wrong with campaign against extremists
he says @entity2 *rejected* @entity10 , was rehabbed by @entity65 , but returned to fight with @entity28
@entity65 fails to realize : key to @entity9 fighters is @entity49 faith . military force wo *n't* win , he says
@entity160 : muslims must fight their radicals ; @entity4 can help expose leaders ' un-islamic *hypocrisy*
