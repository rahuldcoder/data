-- if you 've ever considered running away to join the circus , first you will need to impress someone like @entity4			1
the @entity6 choreographer and former dance instructor is ultimately responsible for casting @entity9 's 1,300 - odd performers			1
she directs a team of 60 , including 21 talent scouts , who work in several countries and across social media platforms to find the world 's best gymnasts , trapeze artists , contortionists , jugglers , ballet dancers , parkour practitioners , clowns , mime artists , musicians , synchronized swimmers and cliff divers			1
originally a small theater troupe formed by a stilt - walking , fire - breathing accordion player named @entity28 , @entity9 began to tour in 1984 , as part of @entity31 's 450th anniversary celebration			1
today , it 's one of the world 's biggest and best - known circus shows , the subject of a new 3d film by " @entity38 " director @entity37 , and with licensing deals for shows featuring the music of @entity42 and @entity43			1
this year , the company estimates nearly 15 million people will see one of its 21 shows , and it will take in more than $ 1 billion			1
more from leading women : the chess prodigy who beat men at their own game to audiences , a @entity9 show looks entirely fanciful , but there are serious logistics behind all that fantasy			1
before joining the company in 2004 as artistic director -- which she says was like jumping on a fast moving train -- @entity4 choreographed the opening and closing ceremonies for the 2001 @entity62			1
it involved directing more than 1,000 people on a field for a year , working with a multitude of people from different cultural backgrounds and artistic disciplines within set corporate protocols			0
she says it was good preparation for her current role			0
" you 're constantly balancing logistics with creative inspiration , " she said			0
" what do you want this piece to say ? what is the message ? but at the same time you can not forget the logistical nightmare that you have to deal with			0
no amount of inspiration or creative genius will make that presentable			0
" besides fulfilling some 500 artistic and acrobatic roles for existing @entity9 shows , @entity4 is also constantly on the prowl for new acts			1
" just when you think you 've discovered every discipline in the world , someone refers someone new and you ca n't categorize them ... " said @entity4			2
" we actually like those moments because we know we 're hopefully discovering something new			0
@entity9 journeys through ' @entity98 ' " we ( were ) just referred a mermaid the other day , " she adds			2
" a professional mermaid -- she 's absolutely stunning ... " once new talent has been identified , signing them up can be a delicate matter			2
dancers and actors often have agency representation while some sportspeople ca n't be approached until they have been released from competitive careers by their government			0
she also observes a particular protocol when approaching performers from longstanding circus families			0
" there 's a certain ethic and a respect on our part -- maybe we will not approach the artist , maybe we will approach the grandfather or the father or the mother and tell them -- ask them -- ' where is this artist in his or her career ? ' " because some of these circus families , they depend on each other			2
( a ) flyer needs a catcher ; catcher needs a flyer			0
" even after an elite performer has joined the company , there are still more challenges to overcome , in order to integrate them into @entity9 's idiosyncratic , colorful mode of expression			1
" they 're seasoned pros in what they do , and we want that high level , " @entity4 said			2
" but we also want them to do dances in the background dressed in weird costumes			0
" even if you 're talking about an @entity156 diver , artistic excellence is usually not something in their vocabulary			0
" part of @entity4 's job , she says , is coaxing elite athletes to take artistic risks , " while assuring them that being foolish sometimes , or outside of your comfort zone , is noble			1

a friend introduced her to one of the company 's first touring shows , " @entity178 , " in 1992			1
" he said , ' you have to see what 's going on in the @entity182 pier , ' and i saw the show and was inspired			2
you were n't told where to look and who to look at -- the lights did n't always direct you -- and so the freedom , as a spectator , was huge			0
you could really sit back and allow yourself to interpret			0
" twelve years later , when @entity4 was working in @entity190 , she was invited to interview for the role of artistic director : " it was a very non-traditional job interview , " she said			1
" the woman was asking me about what makes me passionate , and what makes my heart turn blue , and what makes my blood turn yellow			0
" i thought it was a bit of a waste of time , frankly , but it 's not just about being on stage ; it 's about being in the @entity9 family			1
" @entity4 's husband is @entity9 band leader @entity208 -- they met in a green room -- and she says their two sons have a " crazy life " due to the scheduling challenges of their work			1
but that 's better than a banal life -- the thing , she says , she fears above all			2
" my biggest fear is ... i do n't want to be normal			0
i 'm scared of prescribing to what i 'm supposed to be or supposed to be doing			0
i think that 's a big challenge for me , as a woman : i 'm a mother , we have children , they have friends , we have a community and we want to be part of it			2
" but what makes my adrenaline go is to really embrace the world around us that is n't necessarily normal			0
" ' @entity9 ' is no ordinary circus			2
