-- do the hopeless causes have hope ? if so , how much ? when it comes to the wide world of sports , it springs eternal			1
anyone who saw baseball 's @entity8 fight their way into the @entity11 for the first time since 1985 , only to lose to the @entity13 in game 7 wednesday night , was reminded that losers have been known to turn into winners			1
the @entity13 know that feeling			1
when they took the @entity11 in 2010 , they had gone without a championship for 56 years			1
now they have their third in five years			1
the @entity8 will have to wait till next year for a chance at baseball 's ultimate prize , but other unexpected teams could surprise us in the meantime			1
who might that be ? projections that the @entity30 could meet the @entity31 for the @entity33 's next championship have not as yet been met with a ha - ha - ha , you - kill - me kind of maniacal laugh			1
it could happen , relatively smart @entity33 people believe			2
both bad franchises suddenly look uncommonly good			2
a question of whether the @entity41 could finally make it to a @entity43 now exists , halfway through this @entity44 season , without the requisite rolling of eyeballs or a yeah , yeah , yeah , when - pigs - fly kind of reply			2
it remains improbable , but not impossible , like convincing @entity50 to make a tv commercial for a car			2
not every cause is lost			1
individually in the @entity56 of life , @entity55 , 34 , is a successful pro golfer who has never won a @entity59 tournament , or one of the " majors , " as they in the @entity62 say			1
@entity63 , 32 , has yet to win a @entity65 race behind the wheel			1
@entity67 , 29 , has not been beyond the quarterfinals in a @entity59 event of tennis			2
in other sports shots heard ' round the world , not once has the winning goal of a @entity75 championship match been struck by a certain soccer team we like to call " @entity78 , @entity78 , @entity78 ! " got ta happen sometime , yes ? does n't it ? @entity8 had not been to a @entity11 for 29 years , but finally got its act together this fall			1
@entity83 's pro football squad had n't won a @entity43 game , but that finally happened in 2014			1
@entity31 ' hockey team endured decades without claiming a @entity87 , but now has drunk out of two of the last three			1
some year has to be your year			2
when previously overpowering organizations such as the @entity95 , @entity96 or @entity97 become teams that no longer play for the championship year after year , your team could actually stand a chance			1
no one fears the @entity102 nowadays ; they are pretty much just another pretty good team			2
who 'll finally get lucky ? whose fateful year will it finally be ? here they come , @entity106 : @entity30 ( @entity33 ) last @entity33 championship : none			1
they joined the league in 1970			2
they got their hands on @entity113 and lost him			1
they lost 26 games in a row in the season of 2010 - 11			1
were once again mocked as the " @entity118			2
" ah , but look who 's back : @entity113 himself			2
he went south to @entity121 for a few winters , turned the @entity121 into a hot property , then decided that he longed to return to his native @entity124 , where he would try to win the @entity30 a crown at last			1
you know what ? they just might			2
@entity41 ( @entity44 ) last @entity44 championship : 1957			2
more than likely , this season 's @entity41 will retreat tails between legs to lick their wounds , as they do year after year			0
since the name " @entity43 " was applied to the league 's big game , @entity134 has hosted it , but never played in it			0
but the team 's current record is 6 - 2			0
it is in first place in the @entity143			0
it has a legit playoff shot			0
who 's to say that after @entity149 sings at halftime , the team from @entity148 wo n't win on @entity43 and have @entity134 dancin ' in the streets ? @entity153 ( @entity154 ) last @entity154 championship : none			1
no team has been in the @entity154 as long as this one has without winning a @entity87 at least once			1
its trophy haul is an empty net			0
it looked like last season 's team might change all that			0
@entity166 ' record was a fine 52 - 23			0
@entity153 lovers jammed the @entity168 expecting to sing a new tune			1
alas , out on a sour note they went , in the opening round of the playoffs			0
the @entity153 remain @entity173 - for - ever			1
@entity174 ( @entity175 ) last @entity11 title : 1983			1
oh , the o 's of this season came so close			0
they made their division rival @entity102 , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 eat their dust			1
they won 30 more games than they lost			1
they broomed the man - eating @entity186 right out of the playoffs			0
even after losing two star players , @entity190 and @entity191 , at an inopportune time , the @entity174 could have gone all the way			1
if not for a red - hot @entity195 ball club , @entity174 might well have won its first @entity11 title since 1983			1
@entity31 ( @entity33 ) last @entity33 title : none			1
@entity199 , the boneheaded owner , is out			0
@entity200 , the bald - headed owner , is in			0
@entity201 is a smart coach and there 's a lot of talent on that court			0
on the other hand , these are still the @entity31 , who have been demonstrating a million ways to die in the @entity210 since long before a @entity212 movie by that name came out			1
yes , they really did beat the @entity215 in a game last season 142 - 94			0
is this team for real , though ? it is not now - or - never , but almost			0
@entity219 ( @entity44 ) last @entity44 title : 1964			0
hard to believe this franchise , football royalty , has never been to a @entity43 even once			0
this season 's record is 4 - 3			0
not awesome , but not rotten			0
maybe they can take their division			0
maybe they can get on a roll			0
maybe they can ask @entity230 , who played the @entity219 ' general manager in the 2014 movie " @entity233 , " to join them on @entity43 sunday 2015 , if truth turns out to be stranger than fiction			0
@entity237 ( @entity154 ) last @entity154 title : none			0
they tried nine different goaltenders last season -- repeat , nine			1
that is a @entity154 record			0
trades , hirings , firings , new ownership , nothing 's worked			0
not a single @entity87 for this franchise , founded in 1970			0
the honeymoon near @entity253 is long over			2
time for the @entity254 to stop fouling up in front of their fed - up fans			1
@entity258 ( @entity175 ) last @entity11 title : none			1
quick , name a team that 's never even been in a @entity11			1
@entity262 , time 's up			2
the answer is : @entity83 's @entity258 , one of the true underachieving organizations of all time			2
the @entity268 's were on the brink , missing this season 's playoffs by just one game			0
they have a super pitcher in @entity275 and a splendid player in @entity277			0
what they do not have is a single @entity11 ring with a @entity258 logo on any finger			1
if not soon , when ? @entity283 ( @entity33 ) last @entity33 title : 1973			0
last time anybody expected a title : hmmm , ca n't recall			2
rings - on - every - finger @entity288 is in charge now			0
he helped the @entity290 and @entity215 try on @entity33 championship jewelry again and again			0
it 's a long , long way from contender to champ , but maybe @entity288 can figure out what his @entity295 predecessors have not			2
@entity297 ( @entity44 ) last @entity44 title : none			0
it 's a franchise that 's been to only one @entity43 , which it lost 49 - 26			2
this season 's @entity297 have a record of 5 - 3			0
they and quarterback @entity305 look sharp			0
not as sharp as @entity308 's team and @entity310 's team , but maybe lightning will strike			0
@entity311 ( @entity154 ) last @entity154 title : 1967			0
up there north of the border in @entity316 the situation is bordering on tragicomic , kind of like mayor @entity317 's			0
a couple of seasons ago , the @entity311 made the playoffs for the first time in quite a while			1
a franchise that won 13 @entity87 ought to be able to win a 14th somehow , sometime			1
@entity324 ( @entity175 ) last @entity11 title : 1908			1
being the butt of every joke ca n't be easy			0
" lovable losers " are still losers , no matter how their fans feel			2
when you go 106 years without a championship , you are not @entity334 finally going to the ball ; you are @entity334 still scrubbing the floors			1
but , a young star or two , a couple of up - and - comers , and who knows ? good things do happen to bad teams			2
although where the @entity324 are concerned , nahhh			1
join us on @entity346 / @entity345 .			0

@entity8 made it to *postseason* for the first time since 1985 , lost to @entity13
their move gives hope to other teams that have long tasted failure , says @entity356
@entity31 , @entity30 , @entity153 have never won titles
@entity324 fans have waited 106 years for a repeat of their @entity11 win
