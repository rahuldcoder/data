@entity0 -- @entity2 left no doubt about how she feels about @entity4 and the probation he 's serving for beating her up four years ago			1
the pop star sat behind @entity4 in court wednesday while a prosecutor asked a judge to order the singer to restart the community labor that is his punishment for the felony assault conviction			2
it was @entity2 's second time in a courtroom with @entity4			1
the first was the day in august 2009 when @entity4 was sentenced to five years ' probation and ordered to stay away from her			2
then , she was a witness for the prosecution			0
" she thinks it 's utterly ridiculous what they 're doing to him , " @entity4 lawyer @entity22 said when a reporter asked why his assault victim was in court			1
the @entity32 district attorney 's office has " tortured " @entity4 during his probation worse than any client he 's ever had , @entity22 said			1
in a court filing this week , prosecutors accused @entity4 of not completing the 180 days of community labor ordered when he pleaded guilty to the felony assault charge			1
the paperwork @entity4 submitted to show he had completed community labor is " at best sloppy documentation and at worst fraudulent reporting , " district attorney @entity41 said			0
@entity4 was n't in town on some of the dates reported , the motion said			0
@entity22 , however , angrily disputed the charges , calling them " absolutely false			0
" " and i do n't mean just false , it is fraudulent , " @entity22 said after the hearing			0
@entity4 's attorney said the prosecutor 's filing was so fraudulent that he would ask the judge to punish the deputy district attorneys involved and call for a contempt of court hearing for filing false documents with the court			1
@entity59 judge @entity58 set a hearing for april 5 for @entity4 to return to court , but a full hearing on the allegations will be held later			0
the ever divisive @entity4 @entity58 ordered @entity4 to report to his probation officer within the next two days to be interviewed for a report that will be used at the hearing			0
despite the serious allegations outlined in the court filing , the prosecutor is not asking for @entity4 's probation to be revoked and the singer sent to jail			1
she is asking the judge to order him to restart his 1,400 hours of community service under the supervision of a @entity0 probation officer			1
@entity4 got an unusual deal when he pleaded guilty that allowed him to complete his court - ordered community service in @entity80 , under the personal supervision of @entity83 police chief @entity82			1
normally , community service must be supervised by a probation office			2
the district attorney alleged that investigators he sent to @entity80 discovered that @entity4 's mother supervised most of it , and they found evidence it was never done			2
in response , @entity22 said he 's received 10 e-mails in the past day from @entity83 police officers and firefighters " who observed @entity4 doing his community service			1
" " i 've got pictures , i 've got witnesses , " @entity22 said			0
" i 've got what they do n't have			0
we have evidence that he did it			0
" the motion also accused @entity4 of violating probation by punching singer @entity106 at a @entity108 recording studio last month , threatening to " bust " -- or shoot -- the singer			0
it also notes a @entity114 incident during which @entity4 allegedly stole a fan 's cell phone and a chair - throwing incident after a " @entity119 " interview			0
also , @entity4 's claim to have medical marijuana license , which used to defend against a drug test result , was invalid because the acupuncturist who wrote it was not licensed to prescribe drugs , the motion said			2
this friday marks the fourth anniversary of the night @entity4 punched @entity2 inside a rented @entity128 on a @entity108 street , leaving her face bruised and bloody			1
@entity2 and @entity4 broke up after he was arrested for assaulting her , but they 've made no secret in recent months that they are a couple again .			2
