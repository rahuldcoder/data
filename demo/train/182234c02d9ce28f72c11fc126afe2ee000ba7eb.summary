-- two people yell and struggle on a city street			0
and when it does , what do you do ? @entity7 found himself thrust into this position around 9:40 p.m. sunday , as he was walking in @entity11 's @entity10 neighborhood			1
he saw a man seemingly manhandling a woman , then forcing her into a car			1
@entity7 said he yelled out and called police			1
but three days later , the two -- @entity17 and the man police say abducted her , @entity16 -- were tracked down 115 miles southwest in @entity19 , @entity20			1
the fact that they were found then and there , police say , is largely thanks to @entity7			1
" this man is a hero , " @entity11 police detective @entity24 said			1
abducted woman found alive , suspect arrested @entity7 did n't stop the alleged abduction , nor did he have enough information to name either the suspect or the victim			1
but he did pay attention , he immediately contacted authorities , and he told them everything he knew -- something that does n't always happen , even when crimes take place in full public view			0
one of the most cited examples of the latter happened in 1964 in @entity41			0
that 's where @entity43 struggled with her attacker on the street and in her building , shrieking for help as she was raped , robbed and murdered			0
according to the @entity55 , at least 38 people " watched a killer stalk and stab a woman in three separate attacks " over a more than half - hour period			0
and only one called police , though only after @entity61 was dead			2
this , of course , is n't the only case of what psychologists and social scientists call the bystander effect or @entity69 syndrome , as named after the slain @entity41 woman			2
gang rape raises questions about bystanders ' role in 2009 , for instance , about 10 people watched a 2Â½ - hour - long gang rape of a 15 - year - old girl outside a @entity81 high school 's homecoming dance			0
and two years later , residents of southern @entity84 's @entity83 found themselves on the defensive after video came out showing passersby ignoring a toddler getting hit twice by vehicles			0
outrage in @entity84 after toddler run over , ignored that 's not what happened this week in @entity11			2
rather , @entity7 told @entity0 affiliate @entity93 that when he saw the struggle , " i called the cops and i 'm running and ( yelling ) , ' @entity96 , yo , what 's going on ? ' " @entity7 said that he saw the woman forcibly pulled into the car , then saw her attacker get into the same vehicle			1
" they were in the car for like 15 seconds			0
then you just hear , like , a tap , tap on the window , and then the window come out , " he told @entity93 , referring to how @entity17 managed to kick out one of the car 's windows but not escape			0
after that , @entity7 said , " i jumped back			2
i moved back , i did n't know what was going on			0
i did n't know if it was gunshots or whatever			0
" the witness called police twice and waited for officers to arrive , @entity24 said			1
before @entity11 abduction , suspect allegedly raped , burned girl in @entity120 and what if @entity7 had n't ? what if he 'd walked away and never alerted authorities , spurring them to check that area right away for surveillance video ? what if , because of that , they 'd never gotten a description of the suspect and the getaway car ? what if they 'd never recovered @entity17 's cell phone , which police believe she dropped deliberately , hoping it 'd lead to her recovery ? after all , there are too many examples of abductions that do n't end , as this one did , with the safe recovery of the victim and arrest of a suspect			1
thanks to @entity7 , authorities do n't have to answer any of these questions			1
while a great deal went into the investigation -- from several key surveillance videos , to tips , to the gps device that a car dealer , worried about @entity16 ' bad credit , placed on the alleged getaway vehicle -- it all started with @entity7			1
" if it was n't for him , " @entity24 said , " i do n't think we would have had the same outcome			2
" @entity7 , who @entity93 reports works at a local recycling center , certainly is glad for that and happy to be called a hero			1
" it feels good ; i would n't change it for nothing , " he said			0
" ... but tomorrow 's another day			0
i got to go to work			0
it 's back to being @entity7			2

@entity7 saw a man force a woman into a car in @entity11
he called and waited for police ; a detective now describes him as " a hero "
" i do n't think we would have had the same outcome " if not for @entity7 , police say
