@entity0 tried to keep hope alive , but he knew his wife was dead			1
" many a night , i asked @entity6 to take me instead , " he said in an exclusive interview with @entity5 's " @entity4 " on wednesday			2
" but you ca n't turn off that knowledge , that you know how bad it was			2
... and i promised her , i told her i will honor her wishes			2
" on sunday , someone switched off the machines inside a @entity15 hospital that kept @entity18 's heart and lungs working			1
her family spoke to @entity5 on wednesday in their first national television interview since they won their battle to disconnect the ventilator from the pregnant woman 's body			1
their wrenching court fight drew national attention and sparked debate over who 's alive , who 's dead and whether the presence of a fetus changes the equation			1
now , they say they want their story to be heard in order to save other families from going through the same nightmare			2
@entity18 was 33 years old and 14 weeks pregnant with the couple 's second child when her husband found her unconscious on their kitchen floor november 26			1
though doctors had pronounced her brain dead and her family had said she did not want to have machines keep her body alive , officials at @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity15 , argued state law required them to maintain life - sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient			1
@entity18 did n't leave any written directives regarding end - of - life care			1
but long before she was hospitalized , her family said , they had made @entity18 a promise to honor her wishes , and they were determined to keep it			1
" we looked her in the eye and told her , " @entity0 said , his voice cracking as he spoke to @entity5 's @entity64			2
" and for the state of @entity15 , to not let us do that , was hard			2
you know , you want to keep your word to your loved one			2
" ' they 're using my wife ' @entity0 had no doubt about what his wife wanted			2
they were both paramedics , and it was something they 'd talked about many times as they discussed their days			2
in their line of work , @entity0 said , they became all too aware of families who held on to loved ones long after they 'd gone			2
and of how fleeting life can be			2
" you work on a freeway or a busy road , " he said			2
" that driver just accidentally hits you , and you could be gone			2
" now that @entity18 is gone , her family is pushing for others to have those same conversations			1
" we were together on the same page from the very beginning , which we feel is very important for families that have to go through something like this , that there is n't any in - house fighting , " said @entity18 's mother , @entity94			1
it should be a family 's decision , they said , not a political issue			1
they 've heard protesters and politicians pointing to the case and claiming laws should be rewritten to make sure someone like @entity18 ca n't be disconnected from life support			1
those people , they said , are missing the point			0
" i feel that 's unfair on their part			0
they 're not the family			1
i ca n't take the right away from you to do something with your loved ones			0
i do n't feel they should , either , " @entity0 said			0
" i feel they 're using my wife , unfortunately , as a stepping stone , as an argument for their debates			0
and i tell them , ' that 's wrong			0
' ... they are using her as a political argument			0
" @entity142 : ' we needed to do this for her ' @entity18 's family members were preparing to say their final goodbyes in the @entity147 the day in november when doctors showed them that her heart kept stopping and that her brain was swelling			1
but then suddenly , the situation changed : a doctor told them they could n't disconnect the machines			1
the family says they were shocked , and that even the doctors seemed surprised			1
" i thought , there must have been a miscommunication in some way			0
we said ' no , no , no. that 's not what she wanted			0
she wanted never to be on life support			0
' they said , ' well , but she 's pregnant			0
' and then , you know , it went from there , " @entity168 said			0
" we knew we were n't going to let this rest , because it was n't right			0
it was not honoring her wishes			0
" that 's why the family went to court and kept fighting , she said , even as the going got tough			1
even as it became clearer every day that the woman they loved had slipped away			0
even as her skin texture changed -- becoming like a mannequin 's , cool and rubbery			0
even as the air in her hospital room started to smell more like death than life			1
" there would be times i 'd feel frustrated by the process we were having to go through			0
and i could just feel @entity18 say , ' @entity142 , do n't give up , keep going , keep fighting			1
' and for many days , that 's what i held onto , " @entity168 said			0
" we tried to raise our children to stand up for what 's right , even if you 're the only one standing up			0
and this is what @entity18 would have done had the situation been different			1
she would have stood up for what 's right , so we needed to do this for her			0
" a judge in @entity48 sided with the family on friday , ordering the hospital to remove any artificial means of life support from @entity18 by 5 p.m. monday			1
the devices were shut off sunday morning and her body was released to her husband			1
" the @entity18 and @entity168 families will now proceed with the somber task of laying @entity18 's body to rest , and grieving over the great loss that has been suffered , " the family 's attorneys said in a statement at the time			1
" may @entity18 finally rest in peace , and her family find the strength to complete what has been an unbearably long and arduous journey			1
" now , the family says they know that @entity18 and the baby girl she carried , who they named @entity233 , are in heaven			1
but even the legal victory , which gave them a chance to say their final goodbyes , was n't a moment for celebration			0
" it was n't happy for anybody			0
there was not a happy ending , " @entity168 said			0
" we were pleased that the judge ruled in our favor , and that he realized that @entity18 was not a patient , as the hospital was saying			1
that she was , in fact , legally dead			2
" attorneys : fetus was ' distinctly abnormal ' what happens next ? the hospital acknowledged friday that @entity18 had been brain dead since november 28 and that the fetus she carried was not viable			1
" the past eight weeks have been difficult for the @entity0 family , the caregivers and the entire @entity262 community , which found itself involved in a sad situation , " a hospital statement said over the weekend			1
" @entity266 has followed what we believed were the demands of a state statute			0
" since the ventilator shut off , @entity168 said she 's finally started to do something she was n't able to do for months after she knew her daughter was gone : grieve			1
" for me , closure began after she was disconnected			0
i was able to get a sense of closure			0
... it was hard to start the grieving process when we still had this body that we knew was an empty shell in front of us , " she said			2
" we really could n't start grieving , but now we can			0
" @entity0 said he does n't know whether he 'll pursue legal action against the hospital			2
he said he 's angry , arguing that the hospital misinterpreted the @entity15 law and kept his wife 's heart beating long after she 'd died			1
and he said if hospital officials send him a bill for her time on a ventilator , there 's no way he 'll pay it			1
but it 's too soon to say what steps are next			0
right now , he 's focused on their 15 - month - old son			0
" one of her wishes also was to raise a good man out of my son , and that 's what continues to drive me , and what i will use as my driving point for the rest of my life , " he said			0
" because that 's my job now , to raise a good man , because i promised her			0
" the ethics of life support what no one wants to talk about			0

@entity18 had been brain dead since november
a hospital kept her body on a ventilator to preserve the fetus she carried
her family fought that decision in court and won
machines keeping her heart and lungs working were shut off on sunday
