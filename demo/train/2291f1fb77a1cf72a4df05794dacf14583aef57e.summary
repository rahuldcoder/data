-- convertibles are selling well at the @entity3 dealership in @entity4 in @entity5			1
this seems odd , because @entity4 is hardly the kind of place you imagine driving around with the top down			1
the temperature is in single - digits for five months of the year and it 's even colder if you drive towards coast			2
yet @entity15 , the president of @entity3 dealership @entity16 , says he sold 16 cars in august and september			2
in fact , most of his models are selling well , with business up 50 % over a year ago			0
in the aftermath the march 11 earthquake and tsunami , business across @entity4 is experiencing a reconstruction bounce			1
thanks to an influx of construction workers , evacuees and government compensation money , @entity4 has become the hub of @entity5 's recovery economy , the outlier in the midst of struggling coastal towns that are just beginning to rebuild			1
beyond the influx of reconstruction funds , the disaster has helped open the purse strings of people in the afflicted areas			0
in the face of such much death , why save ? " the consumers ' mindset has changed after the quake , " @entity15 said			0
" people used to try not to spend so much and save money , but after the quake , ( they ) spend more on luxurious cars , also because the stock market and exchange market are not doing well now			0
" @entity4 is an exception			1
@entity5 saw its current account -- the sum of inbound versus outbound trade -- hit a record $ 5.4 billion deficit last month , according to government figures released thursday			1
for @entity5 's export - driven economy , it 's a change of fortune that underlines the economic troubles of the past year			1
analysts say much of @entity5 's trade deficit comes from increased importation and prices for natural gas and oil , which has increased in use since much of the nation 's nuclear power supply has been taken offline			1
getting the auto industry back on the road " one year on from the earthquake , @entity5 's economy remains deeply affected by the disaster , " @entity75 , chief economist of @entity76 , wrote in a recent research report			1
views of the potential economic impact at the time of the disaster " ranged from extremely optimistic to extremely pessimistic , " @entity75 wrote , but both now seem wide of the mark			2
darker expectations foresaw widespread civil unrest , wholesale layoffs among @entity91 companies and a slump in consumer spending -- none of which came to pass			1
on the other hand , hopes that reconstruction would alleviate the twin forces that have been hurting the economy -- the rising value of the yen and persistent deflation -- did not occur , either , @entity75 notes			2
" looking back at the progress made with reconstruction over this last year , we get a clear sense of the strength of @entity5 's private sector , " @entity75 said			1
" @entity91 companies have shown amazing speed in addressing the supply chain problems that have arisen , particularly in the auto part sector , and these issues have been brought to a swift resolution			0
" the government response , however , is another story			0
" in contrast to the great efforts made by the private sector , the response of the authorities has left much unresolved , " @entity75 said			0
" in the aftermath of the earthquake , the ruling and opposition parties were expected to form a government of national unity , but this never came to fruition			0
" @entity91 @entity129 says ' many lessons learned ' one of @entity5 's wealthiest men and the founder of retailer @entity133 , @entity134 , feels the events of march 11 served as a wakeup call to the @entity91 about the precarious state of the economy			1
" we spend double of what we make			0
our administrative structure is the most inefficient in the world			0
this can not continue , " he said			0
he hopes the rebuilding will not be a return to the old ways , but an opportunity to reform the government and make @entity5 's economy more integrated with the outside world			1
still , in @entity4 , business is booming			1
builder @entity153 describes the non-stop calls from people who need to rebuild their homes			0
" honestly speaking , i developed a heart problem in the beginning , because i got so many calls , " he says			0
" my phone did n't stop ringing			0
" before the earthquake , many of his competitors had left the construction industry			2
now , the only limiting factor is workers , who are coming from as far as @entity169 or @entity170 in pursuit of work			2
builders say there is enough work to last them ten years			0
one man 's battle to revive the fishing industry the recovery workers , from laborers to construction executives , are also spending , bringing business for @entity4 's hotels , bars and restaurants			1
the manager of a capsule hotel in downtown @entity4 says his business is twice what it was a year ago , with no shortage of men willing to pay around $ 45 to use the baths and occupy a tiny room for the night			1
many say there is also a change in attitude towards spending , with locals flocking to luxury stores in a way they did n't see before the quake			2
sales at large retail stores were up 10 % last quarter			0
" we used to think , ' let 's wait ' even though we wanted to buy , " says one shopper , carrying a bag from @entity208			2
" but after such experience we learned that such an idea was no use			0

city of @entity4 is center of @entity5 's recovery economy
itinerant construction workers fill hotels , consumer spending also up
goes against @entity5 's wider economic troubles
@entity5 's current account hit record $ 5.4 billion deficit last month
