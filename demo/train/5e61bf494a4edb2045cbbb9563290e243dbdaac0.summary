he 's not going to stop and talk to you			0
' people have already shown you can lay blood in front of them and they 're not , you know , they do n't think anything of it			0

however , she and other @entity6 followers maintained a vigil outside the courthouse during his trial			1
in the @entity32 interview , @entity8 said that @entity6 should not be incarcerated because " he did n't kill anybody			1
... i would rather be in , because i know i laid a lot of my thinking in his mind			0
" @entity64 said he told the jury that @entity8 assaulted @entity22 , but did not attempt to assassinate him			1
if @entity8 had killed the president , no one would have listened to her , he said			1
" she did n't want people to think she was a kook			0
" and she was n't , he said , recalling that @entity8 was very cooperative during her trial and describing her as " a bright , intelligent young woman " from a middle - class family			1

" i wish her the best , and hope everything works out for her , and hope she stays out of trouble , " he said			0
