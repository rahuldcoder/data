-- @entity1 got herself into a frenzy of controversy as a result of an interview with the @entity6 in which she took some shots at president @entity9 's foreign policy			1
@entity10 said that " do n't do stupid stuff , " an infamous off - the - record quote from the president , did n't cut it as an " organizing " principle in foreign policy			1
although she had been relatively silent about her differences with the commander in chief , her comments triggered a firestorm from @entity19 who felt that this sounded like the same old @entity10 , the politician who they had so disliked in 2008			2
president @entity9 's supporters fired back			1
@entity23 rebuked @entity1 through a tweet : " just to clarify , " he wrote , reminding people of her infamous vote authorizing the use of force in @entity26 , " do n't do stupid stuff ' means stuff like occupying @entity26 in the first place , which was a tragically bad decision			1
" @entity1 called @entity9 to apologize for any harm her interview might have done the president and both attended a party in @entity36 , where @entity9 was having what @entity0 commentator @entity37 called his " vacation from hell			1
" it 's not known if they did indeed " hug it out , " as predicted			0
all of this comes at a moment that @entity10 is trying to regain her footing following the difficult roll - out of her book , " @entity50 , " during which she made a number of comments , such as saying that she and her husband were " dead broke " upon leaving the @entity55 , that offered fodder for her critics			2
also , her lead in the polls over @entity63 rivals has narrowed			1
opinion : @entity10 , @entity9 both wrong the most recent controversy over her differences with president @entity9 immediately sparked familiar concerns -- can @entity1 win over the liberals in her party so that " the base " comes out in november 2016 , should she decide to run ? can she prevent a primary challenge from a candidate like @entity74 sen. @entity73 who stands closer to the left 's position on many issues ? the tension between @entity1 and the @entity81 base is nothing new			1
indeed , both @entity1 and @entity10 have always been at odds with the more liberal members of their party as they have been insistent on crafting a more coalitional approach to winning elections			1
back when he ran for president in 1992 , @entity10 infuriated liberals with his " @entity90 " when he made disparaging remarks about the activist at a conference of @entity95 's @entity94			0
during his presidency , his support for certain kinds of deregulation and market - based approaches to public policy , as well as decision to end the federal welfare program , generated considerable heat from stalwarts in the party			2
@entity1 has made similar moves , particularly when she served as senator from @entity109 and worked hard to build bipartisan coalitions			1
most famously , her vote to authorize the use of force in @entity26 in 2002 became a symbol of her alliance with the centrist wing of the party			2
@entity1 wo n't be able to remake herself into something that she is not			1
trying to reinvent herself as part of a presidential run just wo n't work			0
when vice president @entity124 sought to do this in 2000 , his speeches fell flat			0
and @entity1 's extensive record in public office leaves too much of a paper trail for her to pretend to be someone else			1
instead , @entity10 needs to make a compelling argument to the @entity81 base about why she , as opposed to any other member of her party , is the best choice to run for president			2
the most important argument that she will bring to the table is that she can be a fierce and aggressive partisan fighter			0
following eight years when many @entity19 feel that they have watched president @entity9 get beat up by @entity63 on @entity138 , @entity19 are going to want someone who can fight and fight hard			1
ever since her famous statements about the " right - wing conspiracy " that aimed to bring down her husband , @entity10 has demonstrated repeatedly that she has the stomach for the kind of brutal partisan warfare that defines @entity146			0
while democrats in 2008 were still looking for someone who could break through the bipartisan noise , now they are searching for a politician who can accept the reality of @entity146 and take on their opponents by flexing their partisan muscle rather than avoiding it			2
@entity10 's emerging platform about economic inequality is also one that all democrats should be able to embrace			2
in recent months , @entity1 has been telling audiences and reporters that if she ran , fighting inequality would be the major theme of her campaign			1
the inability and unwillingness of the nation 's leaders to address this issue has been one of the greatest sources of frustration for liberals			0
both on ethical grounds -- meaning that the current economic situation is not something @entity175 should tolerate -- as well as for partisan considerations -- meaning @entity19 have traditionally been the party that has been associated with taking on this problem -- the time is ripe for an agenda centered on this theme			0
if @entity10 is as serious about the issue of inequality as she sounds in recent speeches -- such as the one she made to the @entity187 where she promised that this would be her main focus in the coming years -- her embrace of the issue could blur divisions between her and some of her critics			0
she can continue to use this theme to highlight to the left and center that they have much more in common than their bickering suggests , especially in contrast to the @entity63 agenda			1
gender inequality has also been an issue that keeps getting pushed to the sidelines			0
although the government has made some progress on issues like gender discrimination in employment and pay equity , @entity1 is a candidate who has been deeply committed to these issues throughout her career and who could promise to go much further than any president has before her			1
the rights of women and girls around the world is " the great unfinished business of the 21st century , " she said at the @entity217 in 2013			0
her victory in itself would be inspirational to the cause of gender equality , a watershed moment just like the election of the first @entity223 as president			0
while much of the left - center debate has revolved around how to deal with the power of @entity227 or how to use military power , gender equality can also serve as an issue to bridge the left and center			2
opinion : @entity10 dances between loyalty and self - interest finally , @entity1 will need to talk more about the importance of internationalism to her foreign policy agenda as a way to highlight to the base that she is more than simply a " hawk			1
" one of the great questions that came out of the @entity241 years was how much the @entity175 should work in international alliances to pursue its goals			0
for the @entity241 administration , unilateralism was legitimate			0
@entity9 inspired many followers by insisting on a different way			2
as @entity252 columnist @entity251 said about his policies in @entity254 in 2011 , when @entity10 was secretary of state , " the @entity9 @entity55 has shown exquisite deference to the very international institutions and foreign governments that the @entity241 administration either steamrolled or ignored			1
" he has not always lived up to those goals , as has been evident with the use of drone airstrikes			0
regardless , overall the @entity9 administration and @entity1 did stick to an internationalist strategy and she can make a commitment to this approach as a defining aspect of her vision			1
in the @entity265 , @entity264 explained why foreign policy would not have been that different had @entity10 won the presidency in 2008			1
surveying all the hot button issues , such as @entity269 and @entity270 , he finds that the differences between them are exaggerated : " they both are transactors , not ideological transformers â € ” smart , pragmatic centrists largely coloring inside the lines in a world of long shots and bad options			0
in other words , there 's no need for them to ' hug it out ' on foreign policy			1
both parties have often succeeded when politicians find issues that can unite the different wings of their party			0
historian @entity290 ( full disclosure : my wife ) has shown that @entity296 -- without remaking himself into a far - left @entity295 -- championed policies to boost the purchasing power of industrial workers as an issue that could bring together the party			2
during the 1960s , @entity302 did the same with health care for the elderly , while @entity306 used tax cuts and anti-communism to achieve these goals in the 1980s			0
@entity241 achieved a similar effect with the fight against terrorism following 9/11			0
making peace with the @entity81 base will be one of @entity1 's greatest challenges if she is going to run for the presidency			2
without trying to be someone she is not , @entity10 must figure out how to make the case that the @entity81 can stand united behind her			0
join us on @entity322 / @entity321 .			0

@entity1 had to *backtrack* a bit on comments critical of @entity9 foreign policy
@entity328 : @entity1 has had difficulty with the left , but can make strong arguments for 2016
democrats will want someone , like @entity1 , who can be a strong force *vs.* @entity63 , he says
