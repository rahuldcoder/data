@entity0 -- college student @entity2 was among the 1.1 million hopefuls who packed out school and universities across @entity6 on sunday to sit the country 's civil service exams			1
it 's a tradition that dates back more than 1,300 years when exams were first held to select the best applicants for ancient imperial bureaucracy			1
today 's young job seekers are vying for government posts in record numbers			1
like many of the candidates , @entity18 , who will graduate next year , says the prospect of a stable salary and good benefits make it more appealing than the private sector that attracts many of the most ambitious minds in the @entity24 and @entity25			1
" i think the exam was n't too hard			2
i answered all the questions , " @entity18 told @entity1 after taking the three - hour exam outside the @entity29 and @entity30			0
" the pay is not very high but it has good bonus and social security , " he added			0
central government jobs are often described as a " golden rice bowl " for their stable income and generous benefits			1
officialdom can also lead to membership of the @entity42 -- a status symbol in @entity6			1
but with only 19,000 jobs available , @entity18 's chances of a civil service career are slim			1
the exam attracted record numbers of applicants , with 1.52 million completing the online registration process up from 30,000 in 2001			2
about 7,200 people competed for the most popular position as a researcher with the @entity54 , according to the @entity55			0
the annual exam includes an aptitude test and a policy essay , and those who pass make it to an interview round			0
when @entity6 's economy first opened up 30 years ago , going into private business or commerce was seen as the best way to get ahead			1
but the civil service first began attracting huge numbers of applicants a decade ago , said @entity68 , a researcher at the @entity70 ' @entity69			1
" the private sector in @entity6 is not very well structured or developed like the @entity24 , " he said			2
" most of the people in private companies in @entity6 , unless their positions are high , they usually do n't pay well or have a clear career ladder to move up			2
" many of the candidates are university graduates and the increase in the numbers applying for government jobs reflects a surge in the number of university graduates entering a fiercely competitive job market			1
this year a record seven million graduated , up from around two million a decade ago , according to @entity6 magazine @entity86			1
@entity87 and her friend @entity88 were among the class of 2013 trying their luck			0
while some prepare by taking crash courses offered by cram schools , @entity87 said she had not studied for the exam			0
" everyone is taking it today , so i just feel like i should give it a try , and if i got it , it would be simply great , " she said			0
none of the half a dozen candidates @entity1 spoke to said they were concerned by the government 's anti-corruption drive that has targeted both high and low - ranking officials			2
" i think i would not do that -- i have my own principles , " said a man called @entity18 , who said he did n't do well in the exam this time around and would consider taking it again next year			0
the exam is also seen as being relatively transparent and fair in a society where connections can often count for more than ability			0
parents also think it 's a suitable career in today 's uncertain economy			0
" i mean for a girl , being a civil servant can be ideal			0
i know people who worked in the private sector here , they jump from place to place , it 's a lot of pressure , " said @entity121 , the mother of an exam taker			2
@entity133 reported from @entity0 , @entity132 wrote from @entity134			0
