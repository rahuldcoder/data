@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity5 nuclear negotiators arrived friday and began consultations with @entity8 and @entity9 counterparts on the eve of international talks on the country 's nuclear program , state media reported			1
@entity5 's top negotiator , @entity14 , has said he intends to bring " new initiatives " to talks saturday with delegates from the five permanent members of the @entity18 -- the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity9 , @entity8 , and @entity21 -- and @entity22			1
that group has spearheaded diplomatic efforts to persuade @entity5 to rein in its nuclear program , which @entity5 has said is purely peaceful but which @entity28 and @entity29 leaders suspect of having military aims , including a possible nuclear weapon			1
on friday , @entity5 's official @entity33 cited a source close to the @entity5 delegation in reporting that @entity5 sees little encouraging coming from the remarks of @entity38 and @entity19 officials ahead of the talks			1
@entity5 has been under increasing pressure to accept international demands to restrict its nuclear program , including a series of increasingly harsh economic sanctions imposed by @entity38 nations and the @entity19			1
last month , @entity5 officials signaled they were ready to engage with the @entity47 , the @entity28 nuclear watchdog , over the issue			1
the @entity50 said monday that @entity5 had agreed to saturday 's talks in @entity1			1
@entity5 suggested last week that one proposal may be a reduction in the amount of uranium it enriches to 20 % , but it was unclear friday if such a proposal was still on the table			2
while the enrichment is n't enough to create nuclear weapons , which require a uranium content of 90 % or more , analysts and inspectors say it is step toward being able to create a nuclear weapon			0
last month , the @entity47 noted what it called a sharp and troubling increase in @entity5 's uranium enrichment capabilities			0
@entity5 says the enrichment is for research and medical needs			0
as a signatory to the @entity72 , @entity5 has the right , like other countries , to enrich uranium for commercial and research reactors			0
but the same facilities that are used for peaceful enrichment can be used to enrich uranium for a bomb , and inspectors say they have not been able to fully gauge @entity5 's intentions			0
@entity47 inspectors traveled to @entity5 in january and again in february to discuss the issue but said @entity5 refused to grant inspectors access to a military base the agency believes may have been used to test explosives that could be used to detonate a nuclear bomb			2
last month , @entity47 director @entity90 said the agency has credible information that @entity5 has engaged in " activities relevant to the development of nuclear explosive devices			2
" on thursday , @entity19 secretary of state @entity96 admonished @entity5 officials to come to @entity1 willing to make progress on international demands			1
" this is a chance for @entity5 to credibly address the concerns of the international community , " @entity100 said			0
" @entity5 , coming to the table , needs to demonstrate that they are serious			0
" a top @entity5 religious leader , @entity106 , countered friday that @entity29 leaders should back off , according to the official @entity108			2
they should , instead , " react to @entity5 's proposals logically and stop the current unconstructive accusations against the @entity111 , " @entity108 quoted him as saying .			0
