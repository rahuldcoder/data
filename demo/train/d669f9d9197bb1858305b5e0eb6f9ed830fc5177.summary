-- contemporary and often abstract , @entity2 's buildings can baffle , delight and dazzle			1
the 44 year - old @entity4 is one of the world 's foremost architects who is drawing upon different ideas while trying to convey a modern form of @entity4 architecture			2
" @entity4 is a peninsula culture which contrasts from the big land culture of @entity13 , which is incredibly rich , and also the island culture of @entity15 , " @entity2 told @entity0			1
" we 've been very influenced ; it 's almost like a bridge country to observe the many other influences of the past			0
also , there is some tough history			0
" trying to distill amorphous concepts of @entity4 - ness into physical form was @entity2 's task when he designed the @entity4 pavilion at the recent @entity26			1
for an architect who had spent a large part of his professional life outside of @entity4 it was a unique experience			1
" i 'd been influenced by many other cultures , so that was a big challenge to address this @entity4 quality in a contemporary way , " @entity2 said			1
" we had a time challenge situation because they selected the design very late and most of the other pavilions had designs already			0
so -- bigger and faster -- and we had to deal with the economic situation			0
the combination of those three was tough -- a bigger , faster and cheaper situation -- which has become almost default situation in @entity47 cities			0
" many of @entity2 's buildings are in @entity4 , but some of his temporary structures , such as the " @entity52 " set up in @entity53 , @entity54 , in 2008 and " @entity55 " seen in @entity56 and @entity57 , have made it abroad			1
@entity2 grew up believing he would be an artist , but it was only after he picked out a book from his father 's library that he was inspired to follow in his father 's footsteps and become an architect as well			2
that was when he was 12 years old and after he graduated from @entity67 in @entity4 he moved to the @entity68 at @entity69 , @entity70			2
from @entity70 he moved to the @entity71 to work for @entity72 , an architecture firm led by @entity73			1
his time working with @entity73 , who is often called a " starchitect " as one of the industry 's best known names , had a great affect on @entity2			1
" i think that what i learnt from him is that sometimes you get impatient with limitations but limitations can be a leverage ... it just takes more patience and intelligent investigation about these limits , " he said			0
" he 's really a positive role model			0
but usually [ the term " starchitect " ] has a negative term for people that have plateaued at their creativity and start selling their brand name which is also happening a lot here			0
[ @entity73 ] is constantly visiting and learning and observing from this country and enriching his own work			2
" it was not until 2003 that @entity2 made it back to @entity4 to set up his firm , @entity99 , so some questioned if he was the best candidate to design @entity4 's pavilion at the @entity26			1
but for @entity2 his time abroad and work in general is much more than just a national concern and forging a singular identity			0
" as an architect it 's not about replacing one identity but more about enriching our work , " he said .			0
