according to media reports , when asked about those comments during his acceptance speech friday night , @entity1 said : " i wanted to shove it up that black ---			1

we were obviously not there , but if all the reports are accurate , it is regrettable			2
really nothing more to say			0
" in several interviews after his dismissal , which brought to an end a 13 - year working relationship , @entity1 let it be known that he was disappointed and shocked and also brought up @entity2 ' sex scandal			1
interviewed after @entity11 's @entity13 victory , @entity1 called it the " greatest week i 've had in my career			1
" @entity11 and @entity1 are at @entity54 , near @entity6 , to take part in the @entity57 golf tournament and the @entity34 was reportedly among the audience at the awards dinner			1

i think everything in that room last night was all in good spirits and a bit of fun , and i think it probably got taken out of that room in the wrong context			0

i value @entity1 's contribution to my game and while he 's caddying i hope he can caddy for me			2
" there was a lot of language used last night and it 's just this was reported			0
i do n't really think that stuff has ever left the room before and it 's probably good reasons why			0
i think it 's probably all very unnecessary			0

" the comments were surprising , yes			2
these are racially sensitive times , especially in sport			0
it 's unfortunate because it was a very sticky situation , " the @entity122 said			0

i do n't think it was a racial comment			0
