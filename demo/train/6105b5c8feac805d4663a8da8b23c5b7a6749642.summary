-- @entity1 have warned a group of supporters they are slowing the progress of the @entity6 outfit after they opted not to return the freehold to the club 's @entity9 stadium			1
the ground , in the west of the @entity13 capital , was sold to a fans ' organization called the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) in 1997 to protect it from falling into the hands of developers if the club ran into financial trouble			1
but only 61.5 % of @entity17 's shareholders voted to sell the freehold back to the club -- less than the 75 % needed to authorize the move			1
explainer : @entity1 's bid to leave @entity9 @entity1 , who are currently third in the @entity6 , are keen to explore the possibility of building a new ground with a bigger capacity than @entity9 , which currently holds only 42,000 supporters			1
in a letter to @entity17 , @entity1 chairman @entity33 said that a new ground could help the club raise an extra $ 56 million of revenue each season but that the redevelopment of @entity9 was necessary to help pay for it			1
but many fans were not happy at the club 's plans to move away from the site and @entity1 fell short of the vote required			1
the club are owned by @entity48 billionaire @entity47 but limited space around their ground means expansion is difficult			2
two of the club 's rivals , @entity55 and @entity56 , have stadiums that hold 76,000 and 60,000 respectively			2
a statement on the @entity1 's official website read : " @entity1 is naturally disappointed with the result			0
a large number of fans supported our proposals but it was always going to be difficult when we had to have a 75 per cent majority of voting shareholders accepting them			0
" we approached this process with transparency and the will to do what is best for @entity1 and while we will remain as ambitious as ever , this decision could slow down our progress			0
" @entity33 added : " obviously we are disappointed but we recognise and we respect totally that the shareholders of @entity17 have spoken			0
" we will meet with mr @entity47 ( @entity1 's @entity48 owner ) and the rest of the board and we will decide what action , if any , we will take going forward			0
' " i do n't view this as an us and against you , we against they situation			0
we are all @entity1 fans and i can only hope that on saturday we can get together and support this club and beat @entity56			2
