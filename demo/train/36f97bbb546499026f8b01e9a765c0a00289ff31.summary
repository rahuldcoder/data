@entity0 -- president @entity2 says he wo n't act on immigration reform until after the november congressional elections			1
the news angered @entity7 groups pushing him to make good on past promises to halt or substantially reduce deportations of immigrants living illegally in the country			0
it also prompted criticism from some democrats , who have called for @entity2 to act unilaterally in the face of @entity18 obstruction of immigration legislation			1
even republicans who oppose @entity2 's intended reforms found a way to attack the president for not doing something they do n't want			2
here are five reasons why the unfolding @entity0 drama is all about politics and the upcoming elections : 1 ) waiting until after the november election keeps the focus on the voting the election is for all 435 @entity35 seats and about a third of the @entity37 , not the @entity35			1
betting money now says republicans hold their @entity35 majority and perhaps gain control of the @entity37			0
by putting off his move until after the election , @entity2 prevents diverting attention from historically low public approval for @entity46			0
a @entity48 poll in early august showed that for the first time , a majority of @entity50 disapproved of their own representatives			0
an anti-incumbent atmosphere may be the @entity14 ' only hope for preventing republicans from holding majorities in both chambers			2
" for the @entity14 , they want to make this election season about each individual candidate , about their gaffes , about their personalities , " @entity57 of @entity58 told @entity1 on sunday			0
" they do n't want to make this an issue - based election			0
" @entity18 know that , which is why they criticized @entity2 even though they oppose his planned unilateral moves			2
" it 's sad , but not surprising , that president @entity2 continues to play politics with such a serious and important issue , but for this @entity35 politics seems to dictate everything , " said @entity71 spokeswoman @entity70			1
2 ) it avoids providing further fodder to @entity18 attack line of imperial @entity2 according to reform advocates involved in conversations with the @entity35 , @entity2 has looked at expanding a program that allows immigrants brought to @entity85 illegally as children to avoid deportation			1
the @entity35 also could protect undocumented immigrants in industries such as farming			0
republicans , particularly conservatives , routinely accuse @entity2 of exceeding the bounds of his powers through executive actions			0
they consider immigration reforms -- like a @entity37 - passed bill or the steps @entity2 contemplates -- to amount to an amnesty for lawbreakers			1
the @entity18 - led @entity35 already has authorized a lawsuit against @entity2 for allegedly unconstitutional steps in implementing his signature health care reforms			1
proceeding with executive actions now on immigration would strengthen a central conservative campaign issue for november			0
democrats saw " some very scary polling out of some of these red states , particularly among independent voters , where the idea of executive action in particular was not looking good for some of these @entity14 who were hanging on for dear life as it is , " @entity106 of the @entity107 told @entity1 on sunday			0
3 ) @entity14 do n't have to defend a move made less popular by the child immigrant crisis always a volatile political issue , immigration reform became even more inflammatory due to the influx of children from @entity85 across the @entity128 border this year			1
the tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors have overwhelmed @entity50 border and immigration services , creating further backlogs in a system already known for long delays and lack of follow - up in processing cases			0
on june 30 , @entity2 said at the @entity35 he would act on his own on immigration , after @entity18 house speaker @entity139 made clear the chamber would not take up a @entity37 reform bill that passed with bipartisan support			1
the president said then he expected recommendations from his @entity145 on what steps he could take before the end of summer , and that he intended to " adopt those recommendations without further delay			2
" however , the child immigrant influx hardened positions and raised new concerns about lax border controls , causing @entity2 to change his message in an interview with @entity157 broadcast sunday			1
" this problem with unaccompanied children that we saw a couple weeks ago -- where you had from @entity85 a surge of kids who were showing up at the border -- got a lot of attention , and a lot of @entity50 started thinking , ' we 've got this immigration crisis on our hands , ' " @entity2 said , adding later that " the truth of the matter is that the politics did shift midsummer because of that problem			2
" now , he said , " i want to spend some time , even as we 're getting all our ducks in a row for the executive action , i also want to make sure that the public understands why we 're doing this , why it 's the right thing for the @entity50 people , why it 's the right thing for the @entity50 economy			0
" @entity35 spokesman @entity184 said monday that @entity2 " has not in any way altered his commitment or interest in taking executive action , again , within the confines of the law , to act where @entity46 has n't and more specifically , to act where congressional @entity18 have blocked congressional action			1
" " and the president 's commitment to acting on this before the end of the year has not changed , " @entity184 added			2
4 ) it keeps pressure on @entity200 for not voting on the @entity37 plan by not acting now , @entity2 allows his administration and congressional democrats to keep blaming republicans for a lack of progress			0
every chance he gets , @entity2 notes how the @entity37 immigration bill had support from both parties as well as a broad public coalition including business , labor , religious and law enforcement groups backing it , but wo n't pass because @entity35 @entity18 oppose it			1
@entity184 said that " injecting an executive action in the midst of this hyperpartisan , hyperpolitical environment " shortly before the november election could have " a negative impact on the broader public support and on the sustainability of immigration reform			0
" conservatives respond that the @entity37 reforms let immigrant lawbreakers off the hook and would increase competition for jobs as the economy continues growing at a slower - than - desired pace			0
keeping the focus on the broader immigration debate , rather than specifics of any unilateral steps the president might take , allows congressional @entity14 -- especially vulnerable @entity37 incumbents -- to depict @entity35 @entity18 as blocking progress			1
" you have @entity14 now who knew they always had an outside shot , but the president is not putting them under the gun and putting them on the spot , " @entity239 of the @entity240 told @entity1 on sunday			2
" they think they can go to some other issues and have some strengths			0
" 5 ) it responds to the political middle more than left - leaning immigrant communities the news of no executive action on immigration until after the november election angered @entity7 groups and others , who back reforms and who helped @entity2 get strong support from @entity7 voters in his two presidential elections			1
" when candidate @entity2 asked our community for support in 2008 and 2012 , he urged us all to vote based on our hopes , not our fears , " said @entity264 ­ a , president and ceo of the @entity267 , a leading @entity7 advocacy group			2
" today , president @entity2 gave in to the fears of @entity276 political operatives , crushing the hopes of millions of hard - working people living under the constant threat of deportation and family separation			1
" or as @entity1 contributor @entity282 put it : " some on the left are finally getting the message that @entity2 is not their amigo			0
" " for @entity2 , the question is never what he can do for the immigration issue , but what the immigration issue can do for him , " @entity289 wrote in an opinion piece published monday			2
in this case , @entity2 decided that angering his traditional political allies made more short - term sense than putting vulnerable @entity14 -- especially incumbent democrats in the @entity37 -- at greater risk of a backlash against unilateral immigration moves from independent voters who will decide close races in november			1
@entity1 chief national correspondent @entity304 noted sunday that most of the vulnerable @entity14 come from states that do n't have big @entity7 populations			0
@entity14 blame @entity18 for @entity2 immigration delay @entity2 : waiting will make immigration executive action ' more sustainable ' @entity1 's @entity310 contributed to this report .			1
