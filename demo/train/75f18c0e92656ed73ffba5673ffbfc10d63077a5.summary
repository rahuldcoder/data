-- what is it like to be thrown behind bars when you 're 16 and told you 'll languish there for the rest of your life , all for a crime you adamantly maintain you did n't commit ? @entity10 knows			1
he was convicted of arson in a fire that killed 29 people			1
but forensic experts now say they can no longer determine whether someone set the hotel fire on that cool winter day in 1970			1
and on tuesday , in a @entity20 , @entity21 , courtroom , he pleaded no contest to the charges in a new hearing and was sentenced to time served -- almost 43 years			1
@entity10 , now 59 with a shaved head , stood quietly during tuesday 's proceedings			1
but the son of one of the victims of the disastrous blaze at the @entity31 left him with a warning			1
" i harbor no feelings of ill will or vengeance against you , for my father is now gone and nothing can ever be done to change that fact , " @entity33 said			0
" do as you choose , mr. @entity10 , but choose wisely and do not waste your new beginning at life			1
the eyes of this courtroom and those beyond these walls , in mind and spirit , will be watching you			0
" @entity10 spoke briefly to reporters after he traded his orange prison garb for a t - shirt and slacks and walked out of prison , saying , " it feels good to feel @entity55 beneath my feet -- free @entity55			1
" " it 's a tale of two tragedies -- the @entity31 fire , and me getting convicted for it , " he said			1
a vintage landmark burns the @entity31 , built in 1929 , was renowned for its gracious ballroom			1
at 11 floors , it was a protruding gem in downtown @entity20 's skyline at the time			1
on december 20 , 1970 , the vintage hotel was filled with guests , and hundreds more were reveling in holiday cheer at a corporate @entity69			2
just after midnight , a blaze broke out			0
the landmark building 's firefighting measures were badly out of date , and the @entity74 quickly transformed into an inferno			2
a morbid spectacle of human tragedy unfolded			0
twenty - eight people died from smoke inhalation , burns , or , in some cases , when they jumped out of windows to escape			0
the fire wiped out whole families			2
@entity84 was the first journalist on the scene			0
" i still have flashbacks from time to time from some of the stuff i saw , flashbacks of people jumping out of windows to their death , " said the former news director of @entity0 affiliate @entity87			0
he avoided looking at the scene with the naked eye , gazing instead through the viewfinder of a camera			0
" it helped make it a little easier to watch , " he told the affiliate			0
a crowd of bystanders gathered and looked on in horror			0
some hotel guests were able to knot bed sheets together to make ropes and rappel to safety			0
it was one of the deadliest tragedies in @entity20 's history			1
a quick arrest within hours , police arrested a teenage boy , court documents said			2
it was @entity10 , who had been inside the hotel			1
he was n't a guest and did not work there			0
and he had books of matches in his pocket			0
during police interrogations , the juvenile claimed to have seen someone set the fire			2
this was before anyone had suspected arson			2
but the young man changed his story multiple times			0
it made officers suspicious : maybe it was arson ; maybe it was @entity10 who started the fire			1
criminal witnesses journalist @entity84 and @entity87 kept up with the case			0
@entity10 told him that " he had some very tough interviews with the police			1
" he was innocent , he said , a stance he has always maintained			0
in an interview on the 25th anniversary of the fire , he told the broadcaster that the fire never goes out of his head			2
" i think about it all the time , because i know in my heart and @entity151 knows that they got the wrong person			0
i was at the wrong place at the wrong time			0
" prosecutors called two witnesses who were in juvenile detention with @entity10			1
they told the court that @entity10 confessed to the crime to them behind bars			1
later , one of the boys said he had been coerced into his testimony and that it was false , according to court documents			0
experts for the prosecution and the defense testified that the fire , in their opinion , was caused by arson , though the details of their explanations differed			1
in the end , @entity10 was convicted of 28 counts of felony murder			1
judge @entity179 , who presided over the case , told @entity10 that he did n't believe he meant to hurt anyone			1
but the punishment was stiff : " the rest of his natural life in prison , " a sentence that at the time did not officially exist in the state of @entity21 , a court document said			1
in hindsight decades later , people involved in the conviction and sentencing began to feel bad about the case			2
the @entity196 investigative magazine " @entity197 " took up the case			0
the judge told the program that , looking back , he would not have voted to convict			0
the evidence , he said , was not strong enough			2
and if the then - teenager did set the fire , it was not @entity10 's fault that the hotel was poorly suited to deal with any kind of fire			1
lawyers from the @entity210 got involved			0
the non-profit reviews cases it feels do n't live up to just legal standards			0
" it is our mission to help assure that @entity21 's prisons are not housing those actually innocent of crime or otherwise victims of manifest injustice , " reads the mission statement on its website			1
the lawyers encouraged the state to review the arson testimony in the original trial based on modern methods			1
two review committees determined that there is no longer enough evidence available to tell whether arson was in play			2
they said that the experts in the original trial " used methods no longer valid in the science of today			0
" one of the original trial experts , @entity240 , still a fire investigator four decades later , still stands by his testimony today , a court memorandum filed monday said			2
but his testimony ca n't pin it on @entity10			2
@entity0 's @entity244 contributed to this report .			0
