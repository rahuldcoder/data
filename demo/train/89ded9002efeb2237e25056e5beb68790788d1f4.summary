@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity5 president @entity4 's collapse while jogging and subsequent hospitalization prompted speculation and concern monday in @entity5 over the 54 - year - old 's state of health			1
@entity5 president @entity4 shakes hands with medical staff as he leaves hospital monday			1
though the hospital which treated @entity4 said tests had detected nothing abnormal , officials said the president 's fainting had been caused by a nerve condition called vasovagal syncope			1
what is syncope ? syncope ( pronounced " sin - ko - pea " ) is the brief loss of consciousness or fainting caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the brain			1
it is a common condition that affects as many as half of all people at least once in their life			1
three percent of people develop it more frequently			2
syncope may be associated with a sudden fall in blood pressure , a decrease in heart rate or changes in blood volume or distribution			1
what causes syncope ? according to some experts , syncope is often the result of an underlying medical condition that could be related to the heart , nervous system or blood flow to the brain			1
it is also associated with anxiety , fear , pain or hunger and often happens when a person goes from a sitting position to a standing one			2
there are several types of syncope			0
the most common one is vasovagal syncope , which occurs when the blood pressure drops suddenly , reducing blood flow to the brain			1
when a person stands up , gravity causes blood to settle in the lower part of the body			0
in most people , the heart and nervous system will react and give out the correct signals to maintain blood flowing everywhere else in the body			2
but in some cases , the system does not send out the right signals , leading to a lack of blood flowing to the brain			0
what happens when the condition strikes ? symptoms include dizziness , nausea , sweating , falling and , ultimately , fainting			0
after " blacking out , " the person usually regains consciousness within minutes , but may experience a period of confusion or feeling weak for up to 24 hours			0
in 2002 , former @entity97 president @entity96 had a fall at the @entity99 after he choked on a pretzel			1
the pretzel stuck in his throat and caused the vagus nerve to send a signal to his heart			2
this slowed it down and reduced blood flow so much he passed out			0
how is syncope treated ? depending on the underlying cause of syncope , treatment is aimed at preventing a syncope recurrence			0
treatment may include medication ; wearing garments to improve circulation ; changing one 's diet ; taking precautions when changing positions from sitting to standing and in rare cases , implanting a pacemaker			0
with appropriate treatment , syncope can be resolved in most patients			0
