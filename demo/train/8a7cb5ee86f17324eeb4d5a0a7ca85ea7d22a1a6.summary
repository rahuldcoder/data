@entity0 -- on the eve of the @entity4 award ceremony in @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity1 and @entity7 are among the websites and television networks that have been blocked in mainland @entity10			1
the winner of the prize is imprisoned @entity10 dissident @entity13			2
what 's going on ? @entity1 's @entity16 chief @entity15 offers some insight			2
q : there are reports that users in @entity10 ca n't access the @entity1 website and the websites of other news organizations			1
what 's the situation in @entity0 and across mainland @entity10 ? a : @entity1 is completely blocked as of today			1
because when i use [ a privately secured network ] the site works ok			0
but if i 'm using the normal broadband connection at home , that most @entity10 have , an error message comes up			2
it says " this website is not available			0
" it 's sort of the standard thing that happens when a website is blocked here in @entity10			2
q : is television news also blocked ? a : every time our reports are broadcast about @entity44 winner [ @entity43 , who is serving an 11 - year sentence in a @entity10 prison for what the government called " inciting subversion of state power " ] the television screens black out			1
we are required to beam our signal through a @entity10 satellite station before it is broadcast to mainland @entity10			1
that creates a 12 - second delay			0
authorities use that time to black out specific parts of the signal			2
whenever anything about @entity61 or the @entity44 is mentioned , the signal is blocked			1
q : how common is this ? a : they 've been doing this many years			0
usually anything having to do with the " three ts and one f " -- @entity68 , @entity69 , the ' 89 @entity71 protests , and @entity72 , a spiritual group banned in @entity10			0
the process had abated for the last several months , and especially right after the @entity75			0
but in recent weeks we 've noticed the practice has become more frequent			0
but now when anything about the @entity44 or @entity61 as it pertains to @entity10 is reported , our stories are blacked out			1
q : does this occur only in mainland @entity10 , or is it in @entity83 as well ? a : i believe it 's just mainland @entity10 , that 's what they can control			1
q : how do @entity10 authorities police this ? a : they watch our stories and read our stories very closely			1
they probably have written directives over what kinds of stories need to be censored			0
i doubt that people pushing the buttons know @entity103 very well			0
but they probably base it on certain video they see , or key words that they hear			0
i think it 's emblematic of how tightly controlled this is , and how sensitive authorities are about tomorrow 's award ceremony in @entity5			0
q : what are the @entity10 sites saying about the @entity44 , if anything ? a : the authorities are also blocking certain websites that may be touching on this or @entity61			1
i think it 's safe to say that most @entity10 are not aware of the [ @entity4 winner ]			1
and whatever they may have read about him has been through official talking points and state commentary			0
an update on the blackout from @entity15 as of 0830 gmt friday : we have canvassed a few @entity10 people -- students , functionaries , a homemaker , a filmmaker -- and have asked them to try to click on the @entity1 website using their regular broadband connections at home or in school			1
they tell us that the international edition of @entity1 is totally blocked			2
when they log on to @entity1 's @entity143 edition , it loads fine until they click on any @entity13 - related stories and they get the standard notice : " this website is not accessible			0

@entity1 is currently blocked in mainland @entity10
@entity7 is *selectively* blacked out by the government when broadcast to mainland @entity10
authorities appear to be blocking the signal during reporting on @entity61 or the @entity4 winner
