-- the first former head of state to be convicted of war crimes since @entity3 was sentenced to 50 years in prison wednesday by an international court in @entity6 , @entity7			1
the @entity8 convicted former @entity10 president @entity9 last month of supplying and encouraging rebels in neighboring @entity12 in a campaign of terror , involving murder , rape , sexual slavery and the conscription children younger than 15			1
who is @entity9 , exactly ? he was also found guilty of using @entity12 's diamond deposits to help fuel its civil war with arms and guns while enriching himself with what have commonly come to be known as " blood diamonds			1
" for victims in @entity12 , @entity9 's verdict brings relief @entity9 directed his gaze downward while presiding judge @entity31 read the sentencing statement , which began with a horror cabinet of carnage committed in @entity12 by rebels from the @entity36 , which the former president backed			2
" the accused has been found responsible for aiding and abetting as well as planning some of the most heinous and brutal crimes recorded in human history , " said @entity31 , who described one @entity36 military operation as the " indiscriminate killing of anything that moved			1
" he spoke of amputations with machetes -- some carried out by child soldiers forced to do so -- and read accounts by witnesses who suffered under the violence			0
opinion : do war crimes trials really help victims ? " witness @entity53 was forced to carry a bag containing human heads , " @entity31 said			1
" on the way , the rebels ordered her to laugh as she carried the bags dripping with blood			0
" upon arrival , " the bag was emptied , and she saw the heads of her children			2
" a former child soldier , conscripted at age 12 , in his testimony told of " having the letters @entity36 carved into his chest , " @entity31 said			0
" when ordered on a food - finding mission to rape an old woman they found at a farmhouse , the boy cried and refused , for which he was punished			0
" the prosecution had asked the @entity8 to sentence @entity9 , who was president of @entity10 from 1997 to 2003 , to 80 years behind bars , but the judges found the recommendation " excessive , " citing the " limited scope " of the conviction in key attacks			1
the prosecutors had failed to prove that @entity9 assumed direct command over rebels who committed atrocities			2
there is no death penalty in international criminal law , and @entity9 , 64 , will serve out his sentence in a @entity95 prison			2
the former @entity10 president is appealing his conviction and will receive credit for time already served since his apprehension in march 2006			1
the atrocities he was convicted of supporting occurred over the course of five years -- almost his entire presidency -- and reached a peak in 1998 and 1999			0
@entity12 's civil war lasted from 1991 to 2002 , ultimately leaving 50,000 dead or missing			1
although @entity9 was not on the battlefield in @entity12 , the court saw his position of power as president of the neighboring country and the use of his own military 's capabilities to stoke up @entity36 rebels as making him directly responsible for the bloodshed he encouraged			2
@entity9 does not see himself as a war criminal but as a victim -- a leader wronged by corruption and a hypocritical hand of justice with a political agenda			1
" i never stood a chance , " he said last week during his final courtroom stand			0
" only time will tell how many other @entity127 heads of state will be destroyed			0
" @entity9 accused the @entity129 government of throwing the trial by paying prosecutors millions of dollars and claimed that witnesses had been bought			2
he has expressed no remorse and insisted his intent was far from what had been portrayed by prosecutors			0
he has described himself as a peacemaker , saying he should be spared a harsh sentence			0
his defense attorneys pointed to the former @entity10 president 's role in the peace process that ended the civil war as a mitigating factor in his sentencing			1
but after lengthy consideration , the panel of judges -- which in addition to @entity149 included judge @entity150 and judge @entity151 -- did not buy it			0
" while mr. @entity9 publicly played a substantial role in this process ... secretly , he was fuelling hostilities , " @entity149 said , supplying rebels with arms and ammunition			2
last month 's landmark ruling by the @entity8 against @entity9 was the first war crimes conviction of a former head of state by an international court since the @entity164 after @entity3 that convicted adm. @entity165 , who became president of @entity167 briefly after @entity169 's suicide			1
former @entity171 president @entity170 was tried by an international tribunal , but he died before a judgment was issued			0
@entity9 , 64 , was found guilty of all 11 counts of aiding and abetting the deadly rebel campaign in @entity12			1
he was a pivotal figure in @entity10 politics for decades and was forced out of office under international pressure in 2003			0
he fled to @entity181 , where border guards arrested him three years later as he was attempting to cross into @entity183			0
the @entity184 and the @entity12 government jointly set up the special tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities			0
the court was moved to the @entity7 from @entity12 , where emotions about the civil war still run high .			1

new : a victim recounted having to carry the *severed* heads of her own children
he was also found guilty of using " blood diamonds " to fuel a civil war and enrich himself
the former @entity10 president sees himself as a victim of *biased* justice
