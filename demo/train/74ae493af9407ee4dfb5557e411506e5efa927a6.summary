-- to call myself a true ginger is rather an insult to all the legitimate redheads of the world			1
you know , the super shiny ones you carefully hide from your children			2
" @entity10 , what is that ? " " nothing , dear			2
just a horrible genetic mutation			2
" " can we keep it ? " but , alas , i am one of them			2
to be fair , my hair ( what 's left of it ) is really more of a light brown with gentle hints of crimson			1
however , in a pinch , my beard can definitely be used as a warning beacon for low - flying aircraft			2
" @entity29 , should n't that bright red light be wearing pants ? " thus , while they 'll never elect me @entity32 , i 'm definitely one among the people			2
which is why i felt a certain amount of solidarity as i kept reading about the more than 100 redheads who recently marched in @entity38 , @entity39 , during the city 's annual @entity40			1
the @entity43 's first @entity42 was actually orchestrated by a @entity45 comedian named @entity46 , who said , " although it is n't a real word , ' gingerism ' exists , and bullying exists			1
... kids are being subjected to taunts or being bullied in schools just for having red hair			2
" so they marched through the streets of @entity39 's capital , stretching out like a soulless , human laser pointer			1
despite the serious tone set by @entity46 , the event was , of course , organized to be fun			1
after all , if anyone knows how to have a good time , it 's someone who ca n't go out in direct sunlight			1
" @entity65 ! party over here ! in the gazebo ! c'mon , guys ! @entity65 ! wear long sleeves ! woo ! " as the red - haired masses marched down the street , some held positive signs saying " it gets @entity74 " and " @entity75			1
" @entity77 , one little girl warned , " @entity76			2
" i see what she did there			0
of course , @entity38 was the perfect place to hold such an event			1
while the worldwide percentage of natural redheads is only about 1 % to 2 % , in @entity39 , it 's somewhere closer to 13 %			1
which is still pretty low			0
and some people think those numbers may get even lower			0
in 2007 , @entity90 suggested that , eventually , gingers might actually become extinct			0
perhaps as soon as 2060			0
while many disagreed with this prediction , it certainly did n't help that , in 2011 , the world 's largest sperm bank stopped accepting donations from gingers for lack of demand			1
aaaaaaand there goes my retirement plan			0
nevertheless , @entity46 has been encouraged by all the support he 's received in his efforts to raise ginger awareness			1
naturally , then , i was curious what kind of resources were out there on the web for my people			0
so , i did a little researching ... and mostly came up with links for fetish porn			0
@entity77 , in retrospect , perhaps i should n't have googled " dirty redheads			1
" but two hours later i finally got back on track and discovered a couple legitimate support sites such as @entity117 and @entity118			0
i even found several dating options like @entity120			0
" i really like your profile			0
what 's your @entity124 ? " so there 's plenty of love and support out there for us pale - skinned , red - headed folks who need a little extra encouragement			1
still , it 's kind of a bummer that some kids get teased just for being ginger			1
i was never that red , so i really do n't know what it 's like			1
but i 'm sure it sucks , and hopefully these bullies will grow out of it and come to realize that freckles are awesome ! but , until then , if any gingers in the world need an extra boost of confidence , just remember this : @entity147 is a redhead			0
and so are @entity148 and @entity149 , and @entity150 and , apparently , @entity151			0
( but @entity152 does n't count			0
) i applaud @entity153 and his @entity42			1
and maybe next year i 'll be there in person to cheer them on			0
from a shaded , safe distance			0
i 'll be in the gazebo			0
follow @entity159 on @entity160 .			0
