-- why does @entity2 dressmaker @entity3 always seem chic ? what does @entity5 seamstress @entity4 have that others do n't ? and even though it 's been 25 years since " @entity10 " , why does everybody still want a pair of @entity12 ? the short answer is , they 're just really cool			1
it might be a subjective concept -- one man 's cool @entity18 party shirt is another 's discarded @entity21 gift -- but certain brands do seem to stay in fashion forever			1
it 's a phenomenon highlighted by the @entity5 's annual top 20 " @entity27 " list released today			1
@entity10 of the pile is @entity29 , @entity31 's car - maker of choice , followed by @entity33 and motorbike designer @entity34			0
but numerous fashion labels make it onto the list , with @entity39 highest among them at number four , followed by @entity41 , @entity5 designer @entity42 and perennially cool @entity12 sunglasses			1
why denim never fades from fashion so , how did these brands manage to acquire this ineffable quality -- at least in the eyes of the @entity49 ? we ask chief executive of the @entity52 and " @entity54 " council chairman @entity53 for his six rules of cool			1
style is everything from the door handles to the website and the tags on the clothes to marketing events : if people are to be persuaded a brand is the height of cool , the devil is in the detail , says @entity53			2
" it 's not just about making your clothes look good , " he insists			0
" absolutely everything associated with the brand has to exude style -- from the packaging to the company website , to the type - face on the inside label			0
never try too hard no one likes a busybody and , says @entity53 , even the word " cool " suggests a certain relaxed approach			2
" the original idea of being cool is being laid back , not running around like a headless chicken trying desperately hard to please everyone			2
" this , he says , is true for people and fashion brands alike			1
so , if it feels like a brand is trying way too hard to impress -- chasing every trend going , for example -- then it probably wo n't			2
celebrity fashion labels : the good , the bad and the ugly 3			1
stay true to the brand it 's not cool to fake it			2
in other words , if a company began life selling pretty knitwear , it should think very carefully before venturing into , say , leather jackets			0
" you must always remain true to your roots , " instructs @entity53			0
" shoppers want something authentic and it 's obvious when you 're out of your comfort zone			0
" designer @entity42 may have recently passed away , he adds , but it does n't mean that his eponymous label should be tempted to change its style			2
" as long as it ( the label ) sticks to his original vision it will probably stay on the list			0
" 4 ) keep evolving this might sound at odds with the previous rule but , according to @entity53 , it 's certainly not			0
" one of the reasons we keep seeing the same brands on the list , like @entity41 and @entity39 , is because they 're always innovative , but at the same time they retain their core identity			1
" 5 ) do n't be promiscuous some fashion houses squander their hard fought cool rep by plastering a company logo on everything that moves			1
in @entity53 ' view , bootmaker @entity138 have been guilty in recent years of such profligacy			0
" they were known for making really sturdy , simple and good quality footwear			0
now they 've plastered their name on everything , it 's cheapened the brand and undermined their core product			0
" 6 ) be humble a stark word of warning for self - satisfied designers everywhere			0
" successful brands do n't fixate over being cool , instead they just do their own their own thing , stick to their founding principles and follow what they think is right , " says @entity53			1
in other words , if you think you 're cool , you probably wo n't be for much longer .			1
