@entity17 , @entity18 : a member of the military is making history			1
we 'll explain how in today 's edition of @entity0			1
@entity26 is off this week			2
first up : @entity5 crashes @entity30 : first up , @entity6 and @entity5			1
the countries share a border , and they also share a common problem : threats from militant groups and terrorists like the @entity37 and @entity38			1
it 's an issue facing both nations ' governments , and one that the @entity43 government is concerned about as well			1
that 's why president @entity45 has been holding a series of meetings with some of his advisers			1
they 're reviewing the @entity43 strategy in @entity5 and @entity6			1
@entity52 has the latest on those meetings and on the violence in the region			2
( begin video ) @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 : two helicopter crashes make it the deadliest day in four years for @entity43 in @entity5			1
while a @entity63 security force spokesman says enemy fire is not to blame , the loss of 14 @entity43 comes while president @entity45 is considering a request to send thousands more troops to the region to fight @entity38			1
the president addressed service men and women in @entity73 , @entity74 monday , after a @entity76 meeting with his national security team			2
@entity43 president @entity45 : fourteen @entity43 gave their lives , and our prayers are with these service members , their civilian colleagues and the families who loved them			1
@entity84 : the deadliest of the two crashes happened following a raid on suspected drug traffickers , and three @entity90 agents were among those killed			0
also among the dead , three @entity43 civilians , members of the embassy community			1
the @entity96 says the efforts of civilians and other nonmilitary personnel are essential to the overall mission			1
@entity101 , deputy secretary of state : improving @entity5 governance , providing security , justice , jobs and services , and giving the @entity5 people a meaningful alternative , as much as possible , to the @entity37 's recruiting			1
@entity84 : @entity112 senator @entity111 , off of a recent trip to the region , addressed those efforts and the @entity43 relationship with the @entity5 government in a @entity58 speech			1
sen. @entity111 , ( @entity120 ) @entity119 : the fact that the @entity5 government has not prosecuted a single high level drug trafficker damages all of our efforts because it goes to the fundamental question of credibility			1
@entity84 : president @entity45 's @entity76 meeting was the sixth in a series of high - level discussions about what to do in @entity5 , as the administration awaits results from that country 's november 7th presidential runoff			1
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity52			0
( @entity138 ) @entity139 @entity140 student news : see if you can i.d. me ! i was born in 1939 in @entity142 , @entity143			1
i was first elected to the @entity144 in 1986 , and i 'm currently the @entity145 , which means i 'm the highest ranking member of the @entity144 's majority party			2
i 'm @entity148 , a @entity149 who is the senior senator from @entity143			0
public option @entity30 : and in that role as majority leader , it 's sen. @entity148 's job to help combine health care bills from different committees into a single bill that can be presented to the entire @entity144			1
yesterday , sen. @entity148 announced that the combined bill will include a government - run health care program ; what 's been called the public option			1
during his announcement , @entity148 also said that the bill will let individual states choose not to take part in the public option			1
they would have until the year 2014 to make that decision			0
this has been one of the most controversial issues in the debate over health care reform			1
critics argue that if companies use the public option , then some people might lose the health care coverage that they currently have and are happy with			1
but sen. @entity148 believes it 's an important part of the reform			2
sen. @entity148 , ( @entity181 ) @entity145 : i believe that the public option can achieve a goal of bringing meaningful reform to our broken system			1
it will protect consumers , keep insurers honest , ensure competition , and that 's why we intend to include it in the bill that we submitted , that will be submitted to the @entity144			1
@entity196 @entity30 : meanwhile , the @entity197 is back on the road , protesting issues like government involvement in health care			1

the @entity197 plans to hold demonstrations in dozens of cities over the next several weeks			0
one of the group 's main goals is the push for less government involvement , and these rallies also aim to give people who feel that way an opportunity to express their views			2
@entity219 , @entity196 protester : we need to get back to the days when we were responsible and we assumed the responsibility of ourselves and our families , and the government is not a part of my daily life			0
i really resent the government taking up so much of my time that i 'm down here having to protest right now			0
new @entity230 @entity30 : and some potentially good news for the @entity43 economy : a new survey indicates that companies are planning to hire more employees in the very near future			1
