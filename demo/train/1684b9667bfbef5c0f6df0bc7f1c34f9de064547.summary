three members of @entity3 female punk rock band @entity1 were sentenced to two years in prison friday after they were found guilty of hooliganism for performing a song critical of president @entity7 in a church			1
the five months they have spent in detention since their arrests in march count toward the sentence , judge @entity9 said			2
the judge said the charges against the three young women -- @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 -- had been proved by witnesses and the facts			2
the @entity1 members were charged after screaming , " @entity28 , please drive @entity7 away , " in a protest act in february inside @entity23 , one of @entity26 's grandest houses of worship			1
punk bands perform in support of jailed rockers @entity9 rejected the women 's defense that they were acting from political motives , ruling that they had intended to insult the @entity35 and undermine public order			2
however , the fact that two of them have young children was a mitigating factor in the sentencing , the judge said			0

they ignored requests to stop their brief unscheduled protest performance , the court heard			1

@entity1 and @entity3 's surreal ' justice ' " it also runs counter to @entity3 's international obligations as regards respect for freedom of expression			0

he also highlighted recent measures " restricting the freedom of expression and association " introduced after a wave of popular protests that accompanied elections earlier this year			0

it is likely to backfire , " he said			0
