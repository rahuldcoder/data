the @entity0 is unveiling new technology this month at several airports aimed at verifying boarding passes and ids of passengers			1
a total of 30 machines from three different companies will be tested at @entity9 near @entity10 , @entity11 in @entity12 and the @entity14 airport in @entity15			1
@entity16 received the first of the machines and began rolling them out wednesday			2
" we feel that this technology is a step up from the current technology we are using today , " said @entity20 , director of @entity0 's checkpoint technology			2
each company 's machine looks different , has different software and uses different algorithms , but for passengers they all operate in a similar way			0
travelers approaching the credential authentication system scan their boarding pass bar code on the front of a large computer - equipped podium			0
they then give the boarding pass and their identification to a @entity0 employee who puts it in a scanner			1
the computer scans the materials and checks to make sure such security features as holograms and bar codes are present			0
the passengers ' information from the @entity52 and boarding pass is displayed on the computer screen , along with their photo scanned from their @entity52			2
the machine compares all the data collected from the front and back of the @entity52 and the boarding pass			0
if everything matches , the @entity0 agent is then prompted to allow the passenger to proceed			2
" if there are n't any alerts at all , basically it 's a green light , " @entity20 said			0
" they will process the individual and ask them to proceed to the checkpoint			0
" if the data does n't match , agents are able to look at screens showing the information scanned and identify where there is a discrepancy and potentially find a fraudulent @entity52 or boarding pass			0
" we 'll be able to look and see what specific security feature may have caused an alert and that allows the officer to focus their attention in a specific area , " @entity20 said			0
@entity20 said he is not aware of any fraudulent documents found so far			0
one @entity0 employee at @entity9 said he found an apparent mistake by a state which issued a passenger 's driver 's license that provided one gender on the front and another gender in the bar code on the back of the license			1
@entity0 spokespeople asked the employee to stop relaying that story , and would not comment on how the devices have worked since being deployed at @entity9			1
the machines do not save the information collected once the agent clears the data to advance to the next passenger , according to the @entity0 , and passenger data is not checked against any watch lists or other databases			1
the devices are designed to check documents in a " matter of seconds , " @entity20 said			1
@entity0 officials would not specify any predicted time it will take passengers to go through the machine , or if it would take longer than the traditional manual @entity52 check currently in place			1
" we do n't have data with passengers at this point , " said @entity0 spokesman @entity117 , noting it was a pilot program			1
@entity122 timed a handful of passengers going through one machine at the @entity9 checkpoint friday			1
most people spent about 30 seconds at the machine , however the @entity0 agent operating it had to call over another agent several times for help			1
one passenger spent more than a minute and a half at the machine ; another spent two and a half minutes			0
" we are getting that first experience			0
then , over time , we hope to see more familiarity with that technology and faster processing , " @entity20 said			0
the initial pilot machines cost about $ 3.2 million , or a little more than $ 100,000 each			2
the program deals only with document checkers that passengers encounter at the entrance to the checkpoint			2
it does not change the existing screening inside , including metal detectors , body scanners and x-ray machines			0
the pilot program is scheduled to expand to @entity12 on tuesday and @entity14 on april 23 and is expected to last several months			1
" once the testing is complete , @entity0 will make a final determination if we can roll out one or more of these technologies into the airports , " @entity20 said			1
" the intent is to have a system like this at every airport checkpoint in the country			0

the pilot program is aimed at verifying boarding passes and ids of passengers
@entity9 is the first of three airports to get the machines
the program will also be tested in @entity12 and @entity14
the devices are designed to check documents in a " matter of seconds , " @entity0 official says
