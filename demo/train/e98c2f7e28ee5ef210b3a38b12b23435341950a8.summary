the @entity0 is raising a red flag that a potentially deadly bacteria may be lurking in your doctor 's office			1
the bacteria , @entity7 , is typically found in hospitals , but a study out wednesday reports a substantial number of people contracted the bug who had n't been in a hospital , but had recently visited the doctor or dentist			1
the bacteria can cause deadly diarrhea , according to the @entity0 , with infections on the rise			1
the new report shows nearly half a million @entity22 infected in various locations in one year , with 15,000 deaths directly attributed to @entity7			2
in a 2013 study , researchers found @entity28 diff present in six out of seven outpatient clinics tested in @entity30 , including on patients ' chairs and examining tables			0
the @entity0 is so concerned that they 're starting a new study to try to assess nationally whether people are getting @entity7 in doctors ' offices			1
" this is really an important issue			0
we need to understand better how people are getting @entity7 , " said dr. @entity39 , a medical epidemiologist at the @entity0			2
in the meantime , patients should wash their hands after visiting the doctor 's office -- with soap and water , because alcohol - based gels do n't get rid of @entity7			2
another tip : question your doctor whenever you 're prescribed an antibiotic			0
powerful broad - spectrum antibiotics wipe away good bacteria in your gut that fight off the bad bacteria , which leads the way to @entity7			2
@entity58 safety expert dr. @entity57 recommends asking your doctor if you really need an antibiotic , if there 's a less powerful one that will treat your infection , and if you 're being prescribed the antibiotic for the shortest time possible			0
the @entity0 study , published wednesday in @entity66 , said 150,000 people who had not been in the hospital came down with @entity7 in 2011			1
of those , 82 % had visited a doctor 's or dentist 's office in the 12 weeks before their diagnosis			0
the @entity0 is hoping its new study will help determine cause and effect , because it 's possible the patients had @entity7 to begin with and went to the doctor to get help			1
it 's also possible that antibiotics prescribed during the doctor 's visit , and not microbes at the doctor 's office , caused the infection			0
@entity1 's @entity89 contributed to this report			0
