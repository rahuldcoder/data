@entity0 -- republicans are doomed in 2016 if they again nominate a candidate like @entity5 or @entity6 , sen. @entity2 said thursday			1
@entity2 , a tea party favorite who is considering a presidential bid , said his party needs to nominate a " strong conservative " to win back the @entity13 in 2016			2
if not , @entity14 will be president , he said in an interview on @entity16			1
when asked if former @entity20 gov. @entity19 is too far to the left to fit the conservative bill , the junior senator from @entity18 said he is a " fan of @entity19 's " but added that " we need to learn from history			1
" " we need to look to history and what works and what does n't and the one thing is clear is if @entity3 run another candidate in the mold of a @entity30 , or a @entity6 , or a @entity5 â € ” and let me be clear , all three of those are good , honorable men			2
they 're patriots , " @entity2 said			2
" but if we run another candidate in the mold of a @entity30 , or a @entity6 , or @entity5 , we will end up with the same result , which is millions of people will stay home on @entity40			0
" " and if we run another candidate like that , @entity14 will be president , " @entity2 said			1
it 's not the first time @entity2 has criticized @entity30 , @entity6 and @entity5 's candidacies			1
just this spring at the @entity47 pointed to the three former nominees as examples of " when you do n't stand and draw a clear distinction , when you do n't stand for principle , @entity46 celebrate			0
" @entity2 drew fire from @entity30 and @entity6 for those remarks with @entity30 saying @entity2 needed to " check the record before passing judgment			0
" on thursday @entity2 stressed the urgency of straying from the " mold " of those three past nominees because " there is an urgency			0
the states have never been higher			0
" " i think eight more years down this road we risk doing irreparable damage to the greatest nation in the history of the world , " @entity2 said			0
@entity5 and his family have said it 's unlikely he 'll run in 2016 , but it 's not completely out of the question and @entity5 has repeatedly turned down opportunities to shut down voices in the party calling on him to run a third time for president .			1

@entity16 asked @entity2 what he thought about *rumors* that @entity19 might run for president
it 's not the first time @entity2 has *slammed* *perceived* moderate @entity3 candidates
@entity2 said @entity14 would be president if the @entity3 does n't *switch* course in 2016
