-- the energy needs of the world could all , in principle , be fulfilled by one single source -- the sun. there are challenges in making this a reality , however : affordability first , and finding a way to capture this energy efficiently to turn it into electricity			1
recently , a new material known as perovskite has seen the light of day and within just a few years it has started rivaling the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic solar cells , which currently maxes out at roughly 20 percent			1
this is the amount of solar energy that gets converted into electricity and the higher this is , the more we meet our energy needs			1
over 80 percent of today 's photovoltaics are made from crystalline silicon , but the high expense of both their production and installation means we are in need of alternatives			0
@entity33 is a mineral found in the @entity36 's mantle , named after @entity38 mineralogist @entity37			1
since 2009 , it has caught the attention of researchers across the globe , including those at @entity44 and the @entity45 in @entity46 ( @entity47 )			0
" in a very short time , perovskite has begun to produce extremely high efficiencies and there 's ' perovskite fever ' going on , " says @entity48 , director of the laboratory of photonics and interfaces at @entity47			2
" today , efficiency has peaked at 18 percent , but it 's expected to get even higher in the future			0
" @entity48 discovered how perovskite works and he 's helping develop new solar cells as well as potential ways to add on to existing ones : " you can put perovskite on top of traditional silicon cells to make them more efficient , " he says			1
" this is not an expensive process and can become an attractive application for mainstream solar panels			2
" stability tests are still needed as this magical material is sensitive to water and high temperatures : " this is all being examined now			2
i 'm optimistic and sure this can be tackled			0
it 's an exciting time "			0
@entity33 solar cells may be the ones to watch , but the search for the most efficient , affordable and usable form of solar energy is a diverse battlefield			1

@entity33 is a new wonder material used to make cheap and efficient solar cells
new , self - *cooling* solar cells could *overcome* the challenges of *overheating*
regular *windows* could produce electricity by using a new , transparent solar cell *technology*
old *car* *batteries* could be *recycled* into solar cells
