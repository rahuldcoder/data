two more hiv patients have no signs of the virus in their blood following bone marrow transplants , according to the @entity6 researchers who treated them			1
however , experts stopped short of calling the two cured and said the treatment is not a viable option for the majority of @entity13 patients			1
the findings were presented wednesday at the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17			0
the two men , whose identities are being withheld , had been on antiretroviral ( @entity21 ) drug therapy for years before being diagnosed with lymphoma , a cancer of the lymph nodes			2
both underwent intensive chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplants to treat the cancer			1
they remained on antiretroviral therapy			0
approximately four months after the transplant doctors were still able to detect @entity13 in their blood , but six to nine months later , all traces of the virus were gone			1
" because of those findings , we thought it was justified to take the patients off of their therapy to see what happens , " said dr. @entity34 , who conducted the clinical trial			2
" now , in a normal person who has @entity13 , who has been on long - term antiretroviral therapy for years , usually the virus comes back within two to four weeks after stopping therapy , it comes right back			1
" some patients make it up to eight weeks before the virus returns , said @entity34 , a researcher at @entity50 and @entity51 in @entity6 , but the virus returns eight to 10 weeks after therapy is stopped in the vast majority of patients			1
@entity13 discovery ' will change your life forever ' not so for these two , however			1
" we are now recording 15 weeks after therapy and eight weeks after therapy for our two patients , and to date we are unable to detect @entity13 rebounding in the bloodstream after we stopped the therapy , " @entity34 said			1
" we do weekly monitoring , as well			0
we 've been looking at the virus in the blood and the cells in the blood essentially every week since we 've taken them off therapy , and we have not been able to detect virus at this time			0
" the two men are being compared to @entity73 , also known as the " @entity74			2
" @entity73 is thought to be the first person ever " cured " of hiv / aids			2
in 2007 , @entity73 had a stem cell transplant to treat his leukemia			2
his doctor searched for a donor with a rare genetic mutation called @entity82 that makes stem cells naturally resistant to hiv infection			0
today , the virus is still undetectable in @entity73 's blood , and he is still considered to be " functionally cured			1
" a functional cure means the virus is controlled and will not be transmitted to others			0
the stem cell transplant procedure , however , is very dangerous because a patient 's immune system has to be wiped out in order to accept the transplant			1
using a bone marrow transplant to treat @entity13 is not a feasible treatment for most patients , and only 1 % of @entity99 -- mostly @entity101 @entity100 -- and no african - americans or @entity102 have the @entity82 delta32 mutation , researchers say			1
the transplant is still not a practical strategy for the majority of @entity13 patients , and the risk of mortality is up to 20 % , @entity34 says			1
dr. @entity111 , director of the @entity112 at the @entity113 , agreed			0
" this is not a practical approach for someone who does not need a stem cell transplant since the transplant and its preparation and its subsequent need for chronic immunosuppression is a risky procedure , " @entity111 said			2
" if you have an underlying neoplasm ( tumor ) like these patients had , then the risk outweighs the benefit , " he said			0
" however , if you are doing well on @entity131 and you merely want to get off antiretroviral therapy , then the risk seems greater than the benefit			0
" @entity13 ' cure ' in toddler offers ' global hope ' even though the two patients showed a reduction of the virus in the blood , it could still be in some tissue -- the brain or gastrointestinal tract , for instance , @entity34 said			1
the virus " could certainly return , " he said			0
" it 's possible , again , that the virus could return in a week , it could return in a month -- in fact , some mathematical modeling predicts that virus could even return one to two years after we stop antiretroviral therapy , so we really do n't know what the long - term or full effects of stem cell transplantation and viral persistence is			2
" still , he feels the information will help move the curative field of hiv research forward			0
" we 're going to learn different strategies about how we can attack the viral reservoir , how we can harness the immune system better and what exactly caused the lack of virus in the two patients at least in the short term			0
" earlier this year , researchers said an hiv - positive baby in @entity172 was given high doses of three antiretroviral drugs within 30 hours of her birth , with doctors hoping that would control the virus			0
two years later , there is no sign of @entity13 in the child 's blood , making her the first child to be " functionally cured " of @entity13			1
the @entity186 , or @entity187 , helped fund the study			0
" these findings clearly provide important new information that might well alter the current thinking about @entity13 and gene therapy , " said @entity187 ceo @entity189			2
" while stem cell transplantation is not a viable option for people with @entity13 on a broad scale because of its costs and complexity , these new cases could lead us to new approaches to treating , and ultimately even eradicating , @entity13			1
" " dr. @entity34 is charting new territory in hiv eradication research , " said dr. @entity203 , @entity187 vice president and director of research			0
" whatever the outcome , we will have learned more about what it will take to cure @entity13			2
we believe @entity187 's continued investments in @entity13 cure - based research are beginning to show real results and will ultimately lead us to a cure in our lifetime			1
" in the meantime , @entity34 says he and other groups are actively enrolling patients for these types of studies			0
opinion : an aids - free generation is within sight			0

two men show no sign of @entity13 after bone marrow transplants
but experts say it 's too early to know if the two are cured
the transplant is n't a viable option for the vast majority of patients
