@entity0 -- they say one man 's trash is another man 's treasure and for @entity7 , founder and ceo of @entity9 , that could n't be more true			1
his @entity11 - based company is helping millions of people wise - up to waste recycling			2
but is was a wacky idea that got 29 - year - old @entity7 started			1
" my friends and i were trying to grow some plants and realized worm poop was one of the best fertilizers to feed them , " @entity7 said , " ... and that suddenly started getting me to thinking differently about waste			1
" he started manufacturing " worm poop " and packaging the organic fertilizer in used plastic bottles selling it as " @entity24 " under the name @entity9			1
eight years on , the company now turns all sorts of non-recyclable waste from all over the world into recyclable eco-friendly products			1
" we collect about a billion pieces of waste every month from close to 25 million people , across 19 countries , " @entity7 explains			1
garbage is very much a global problem , he says			0
but whether it 's @entity39 ( who recycle a lot ) or in countries like @entity44 , which he says is relatively poor at recycling , @entity9 's model is consistent			2
from what he collects , the creations are endless			0
juice pouches are made into school folders and kids backpacks ; chip bags become bags , even furniture			0
" every @entity55 ( a clothing chain ) in @entity57 has now started collecting flip flops and we are taking those flip flops and building them into playgrounds around the @entity57 , " @entity7 said			1
@entity9 's influence is also growing around the world , says @entity7 , with the company now collecting 6 % of @entity39 's coffee capsules and 2 % of all of the @entity67 's pens			1
there is no waste stream that can not be recycled , he says , even diapers and chewing gum			2
" we will be taking used gum , literally old chewing gum , collecting it all over @entity75 and making it into all sorts of plastic products , " he said			2
" @entity78 is actually just flavored plastic so we can very easily make it into any plastic product you can imagine			0
" trash comes from individuals and major companies around the globe			0
schools are also major contributors			0
" we are in , i believe , 73 % of @entity57 elementary schools , actively collecting waste for us and that is the same all around the world , " he said			0
" we find out that kids care a lot about the environment and they are all willing to be engaged and get their hands dirty if you will and bring in waste and make it really happen			0
" but @entity9 do n't just take the trash away , they also give back @entity7 says , paying shipping costs as well as making donations to schools or charities which so far has raised nearly $ 3 million			1
@entity7 continues to grow the business			2
a new @entity107 game , " @entity108 " was recently launched and next year he will steer the company into new markets in @entity111 and @entity112			0
all with the aim of saving more waste from landfills and incinerators while spreading the company 's mantra , " @entity119 , " and turning the world 's trash into cash .			0
