@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was just before 8am on march 11 , 2004 and i was making breakfast at home , listening to @entity1 's leading radio network			1
suddenly there was a report of explosions at the @entity12 train station downtown			0
the terrifying damage , we would later learn , had occurred about 20 minutes earlier : coordinated bomb explosions on four rush - hour trains that would leave 191 people dead and more than 1,800 wounded			1
but those initial hours were filled with confusion			0
i called @entity2 's main news desk in @entity21 -- it was just before 2am there -- and said that a major tragedy appeared to be unfolding in @entity0			1
soon after i was on air , and very quickly our camera crew was outside @entity12 station , close to my home			1
across town , in a neighborhood by the @entity30 station -- where one of the trains exploded -- nine - year - old @entity33 watched her mother behaving as never before			1
her father , a telephone installer , had boarded a train for @entity12 station that day			1
" the first image was my mother , hysterical , trying to call on the phone			0
i imagine she was trying to locate my father , " says @entity45 , who 's now 19 and studying journalism			1
" i miss him so much			0
he 's the first person i think of in the morning and the last person i think of at night			2
" the @entity0 train bombings were the deadliest terror attack in western @entity52 since the bombing of @entity54 over @entity55 , @entity56 in 1988 which killed 270 people			1
the terrorists in @entity0 , the authorities later determined , carried bombs in sports bags and backpacks onto four commuter trains serving the east of the @entity1 capital			1
and then they got off , leaving their deadly devices to explode onboard			0
@entity45 says that she always tried to think of her father and look to the future when she was growing up			2
" i 'd rather focus on him being proud , seeing me achieve my goals , " she says			0
" that 's why i am always setting higher targets			2
" she 's already an intern in the newsroom of @entity74 , the same station i was listening to on that fateful morning			2
the attacks proved highly political in @entity1			2
general elections had already been scheduled for just three days later and , in a surprise result , the ruling conservatives lost to the opposition socialists			0
the @entity1 courts later convicted 14 @entity84 militants for their roles in the bombings , along with four @entity1 for trafficking in explosives used in the attacks			2
a further seven key @entity84 suspects blew themselves up three weeks after the train attacks as police closed in on their hideout in a @entity0 suburb			1
initial theories that the @entity96 terrorist group @entity95 had carried out the attack were later discredited by the police and international terrorism experts who blamed @entity84 militants			0
but the alleged @entity95 role in the bombings has become an ongoing conspiracy theory still heard in some quarters in @entity1 , adding to the polarization seen on the anniversaries of the attacks			0
this week the main victim groups are expected to take part at the same event for the first time in years			1
in the past political differences have sometimes divided the organizations -- but they will unite for a @entity115 at @entity116 , to be attended by @entity117 and prime minister @entity118			0
as usual the victim groups will also observe their own , separate commemorations			1
@entity33 did n't ride public transportation for years after her father 's death -- until she got fed up			1
" why is a terrorist group going to keep me from riding a train , after they 've already taken away a fundamental pillar of my life ? " she asks			0
" all the bad things already happened to me			0
and if it does , i will get through it , " she added			0
" i have to look happily toward the future , because if not , i 'd go crazy			0

on march 11 , 2004 , bombs on four trains in @entity0 left *hundreds* dead and wounded
the attacks took place near the home of @entity2 's @entity141 , who recalls the *incident*
father of @entity33 , aged nine at the time , had boarded one of the ill - fated trains
this week the main victim groups are expected to unite at a mass for the first time in years
