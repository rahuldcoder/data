-- six hundred years ago , @entity1 was just a nice place to stop and buy a waffle on the way to @entity5			1
today , it 's a city of 1.8 million , the capital of @entity8 , the headquarters of @entity10 and the political center of the @entity12			1
it may be easy to skip as you zip from @entity15 to @entity16 by train , but its rich brew of food and culture pleasantly surprises those who stop			1
its magnificent grand square , rightly named @entity25 , alone makes a visit worthwhile			1
when in @entity1 , try mussels with a side of crispy fries , or frites			1
the city is still buzzing over the opening of its new @entity33 in june			1
with more than 250 paintings , it has the world 's largest collection of works by surrealist @entity39 , who famously painted a picture of a pipe and wrote on the canvas " this is not a pipe			1
" take time to wander through @entity1 ' other excellent museums			1
the @entity47 , featuring @entity49 and @entity8 art , has a dazzling collection of masterpieces by @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
the @entity56 next door also makes for an enjoyable stroll			1
@entity1 has its silliness , too			2
its mascot is the @entity61 , a fountain statue of a little boy who lives up to his name			2
you 'll find him three blocks off @entity25 , possibly wearing some clever outfit			2
by tradition , countries send him costumes from around the world			2
cases full of these are on display in the @entity75 on @entity25			2
the @entity76 , another of @entity1 ' offbeat attractions , looms on the edge of town			2
this gigantic , silvery iron " molecule " has escalators connecting the various " atoms , " fun space - age videos and a view from the top sphere			2
if you 're scared of heights or tight spaces , tell your friends you 'll wave to them ... from the ground			2
if you 're hungry , muscle your way into a restaurant to order mussels in @entity1			2
you get a big - enough - for - two bucket and a pile of fries			0
use an empty shell to tweeze out the rest of the mussels			0
do n't call fried potatoes " @entity106 fries			0
" belgian fries ( " frites " ) taste so good because they 're deep - fried twice -- once to cook , and once to brown			0
the locals dunk them in mayonnaise , especially delicious if the mayo is flavored with garlic			0
my favorite budget meal in @entity1 is having simple pub grub in an atmospheric old pub with a gaggle of " beer pilgrims , " who 've flocked here from around the world to appreciate some of @entity124 's best brew and selection -- more than 300 @entity8 varieties			1
to get a budget hotel deal , visit in peak season without a reservation , when the city 's fancy business - class hotels rent rooms for half - price			0
normal hotel prices are high , but if you arrive in july , august or on a friday or saturday night any other time , three - star hotels abound with amazing summer rates -- you can rent a double room with enough comforts to keep a diplomat happy , including a fancy breakfast , for about $ 85			0
go through the tourist information office to get the best price			0
if you 're nervous about traveling without advance reservations , contact the tourist office by email ( info@visitflanders.be ) and ask which business - class hotels will have special rates during your visit			0
bone up on bonjour and s'il vous plait			0
though the city ( and country ) is officially bilingual and filled with foreign visitors , 80 percent of the locals speak @entity106 first and @entity159 second , if at all			0
@entity8 is split between @entity160 in the south , where they speak @entity106 , and @entity163 in the north , where they speak @entity49 , a dialect of @entity167			0
@entity106 - speakers have often dominated the national government , which irks the @entity49 , who comprise about 60 percent of the @entity8 population			0
the longstanding rivalry has made it increasingly difficult for the @entity8 @entity173 to form a stable coalition government			0
one prime minister recently said that @entity8 are united only by the king , a love of beer and the national soccer team			0
while the @entity8 debate their unity , @entity1 is the administrative center of the @entity12			0
it hosts business people from around the world -- only @entity185 , has more lobbyists			1
when @entity124 have a gripe , this is where they demonstrate			1
the @entity173 , a towering complex of glass skyscrapers , has 785 members representing 28 countries and more than 450 million citizens			0
it 's exciting just to be here -- a mouse in the corner of a place that aspires to chart the future of @entity124			1
@entity1 is one of @entity124 's great secrets			1
a trade boom 500 years ago left this city with striking art and stately architecture			0
and it 's once again a trade and cultural center of @entity124			1
