-- the @entity1 will be abstaining , one @entity2 is more open - minded while the @entity3 will only have themselves for company			1
it 's a debate as old as time -- should football stars keep it clean between the sheets to maximise athletic performance ? @entity12 national team coach @entity10 is taking a relaxed view on in - competition coitus during the @entity15			1
" i think we are very casual in the way we approach things , " @entity10 , a @entity15 winner in 1990 with @entity16 , told @entity17			1
" their families can come pretty much any time			0
they will be at the games , they can come by at the hotel , we will have barbecues together			0
" every nation is different			0
i 've played in different countries where , you know , you did n't see your girlfriend or your wife for two months			0
... every team and every country handles that differently , based on their culture			0
" so i respect the @entity1 approach because it 's more their culture at that moment			1
i think we have a group of guys together and an environment together that is very open , very casual			0
" but once we go on the field for training and also for the games , we are very serious and down to business			0
" as @entity10 suggested , the @entity1 will be adopting a more chaste approach , with " @entity51 " coach @entity50 warning his players to restrain from sexual activity during the month - long tournament			1
" if a player ca n't go one month or 20 days without having sexual relations , then they are not prepared to be a professional player , " @entity50 told @entity1 newspaper @entity55			1
" all the players we have selected have a pretty good resume , they all have won great things , they have been champions , and they know what we want to achieve			2
" so then we will not be looking for sex or having sex at the @entity15 just to have it , we are going to go after what we came for , a competition that gives us the opportunity to rise above and do something really great			2
... we talked about it because there was a buzz			0
" music to the ears of @entity3 's coach @entity77 , who according to @entity79 newspaper the @entity78 , told his players " there will be no sex in @entity83			1
" yet @entity77 , who is leading @entity3 at its first major tournament , has allowed one small concession			1
" they can find another solution , they can even masturbate if they want			0
i am not interested what the other coaches do , this is not a holiday trip , we are there to play football at the @entity15			2
" do you think footballers should be allowed to have sex at the @entity15 ? let us know in the comments below			2
