-- as the director of " @entity3 " nos. 1 , 2 and 3 , filmmaker @entity1 is intimately familiar with the massive needs of a potential summer blockbuster			1
the explosions have to be bigger ; the scenes more captivating ; the action sequences more believable and awe - inspiring			0
" i think every director who 's making a big movie this summer has gone through the same thing , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity10			1
" that 's what audiences expect , and you 've got ta be really entertaining			2
" on july 3 , @entity1 will enter the summer box office race not with pirates , but cowboys			1
with @entity22 producing ( as he 's done with the " @entity3 " franchise , among several other top @entity25 titles ) , @entity1 has enlisted @entity26 and " @entity3 " star @entity27 to help him reinvent and tell the origin story of the masked seeker of justice			1
" @entity36 , " which just released its fourth trailer on wednesday , was shot over five months across @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			0
it was a strenuous , stressful undertaking as the crew pulled 18 - hour days in places such as @entity41 , a location so arid " we 're still getting dust out of our ears and nose and eyes , " @entity1 said			0
" nobody understands how difficult it is actually to do it , " @entity22 added			0
" the grueling hours , the lack of sleep			0
[ @entity1 's ] always looking for another location -- he lost a location , he 's got to shoot something else the next day , an actor 's sick			1
... it 's just unbelievable that you 're running this thing for a number of months and you 're moving an army five states			0
" all in the name of the summer blockbuster			1
and the locations , which were painful but necessary to endure given that " @entity36 " is a @entity66 , were just half the challenge			0
@entity1 , it seems , was n't willing to settle for a fake locomotive -- those trains you see roaring through the tv spots were man - made			0
" everything is real , " @entity22 said			0
" @entity1 does n't like to do it with the visual effects , so those guys are really on the train , the train is actually moving , it 's not a @entity80 shot -- so everything you see here is real			2
so it had to be built			0
you ca n't imagine how many people it takes just to keep the train running ; to get the stunt guys to keep the guys on top of the train ; the rigging so they 're all safe and the amount of extras [ to be ] the people in the background ; it 's just a lot			2
" is it any wonder that , on a scale of difficulty ranging from 1 - 10 , @entity1 puts making " @entity36 " at an " 11 " ? " eleven , definitely			1
this is the hardest movie , " @entity1 said			2
" i mean , hats off to [ ' @entity105 , ' ' searchers ' director ] @entity108 and [ ' @entity111 ' director ] @entity109 [ @entity112 ] and all those kinds who make these @entity66 because they 're really hard			2
i mean we all know what a train looks like and we all know what horses look like and it 's not a giant robot or a flying saucer , so what are you going to [ do ] , put someone against a blue screen ? " that 's not to say that the popcorn sci - fi flicks are more forgiving , because " there are no easy movies -- those movies are really hard too , " @entity127 said			1
" but we know what that [ @entity66 ] reality looks like , there 's a whole language that 's been established about what we know and feel from real horses and real dirt and real trains , and they 're hard movies			1
this movie has @entity143 and cavalry and trains , and we went and shot in five states			0
it 's a big movie			2
" but by now , " big " is just what we expect from @entity1 , and especially when paired with @entity22 , and they 're hoping " @entity36 " will come across as an explosive , fresh take on a familiar story			1
" [ @entity1 ] makes big movies and that 's what audiences love and that 's why summer movies become blockbusters , because you give them a lot of punch for their 10 or 12 bucks , " @entity22 said			1
" [ we 're ] reinventing the tale of the @entity36 , but starting with the origin			1
it 's the origin story , told through @entity165 's point of view , who 's not quite accurate with what he remembers , so it 's a lot of fun			0
" @entity27 's latest movie projects @entity0 's @entity172 contributed to this report .			0

director @entity1 says audience expectations are high for a summer blockbuster
the demands for a movie as big as " @entity36 " are even greater
