-- if you 're watching the first round of the @entity3 playoffs this weekend , take a good look at the players ' jerseys			1
you 'll see the standard features : names of the teams , numbers and names of the players			1
make a mental picture of what you 're looking at			0
because there 's a chance the old - style jerseys may become just a memory			1
as @entity22 of the @entity23 reported , @entity3 owners at a meeting in @entity21 this month were presented with a display of six mannequin torsos			1
three of the mannequins wore @entity29 jerseys			1
but the jerseys had been intentionally altered , for the owners ' consideration			2
they were festooned with advertising			0
the prominence of the on - jersey ads varied : one version did away with the team name and replaced it with the name of a corporate advertiser ; a second version featured the advertiser 's name beneath the player 's number ; a third put the advertiser 's logo on a strap of the jersey			1
the @entity3 has not decided whether it will begin the move to jerseys bearing ads. none of the four major @entity57 sports leagues -- the @entity3 , @entity58 , the @entity59 and the @entity60 -- permits advertising on team uniforms			1
but other professional sports -- auto racing , golf and soccer -- let athletes display ads on their clothing			2
and when @entity22 asked @entity70 , deputy commissioner of the @entity3 , about the league 's position on instituting jerseys with ads , @entity70 said : " if we add sponsor logos to jerseys , we recognize that some of our fans will think we 've lost our minds			1
but the @entity3 is a global business and logos on jerseys are well - established in other sports and commonplace outside the @entity85 " if and when it happens -- if the @entity3 becomes the first major @entity57 sports league to turn uniforms into advertising billboards -- the surprising thing may turn out to be how quickly the public , after expressing initial consternation , decides that it 's no big deal			1
advertising once was seen as having the potential to be an unwelcome intrusion of hucksterism into places where hucksterism did not belong			0
but if there was a line that was not supposed to be crossed , that line was obliterated long ago			0
not only is advertising ubiquitous and largely unquestioned today , it has managed to become a sought - after symbol of something 's -- or someone 's -- worth			2
if a national corporation -- a soft drink , a breakfast cereal , an energy bar -- pays to put its brand on the t - shirt for a charity race , or on a local school 's football stadium , or in the program for a college reunion , there is a sense of officially making the big time			2
" selling out " was for years a pejorative phrase , but it has lost much of its punch ; national advertisers have worked so effectively to elevate the power of their brands , that there is status inherent in being connected with them and with their success			2
to paraphrase the old @entity133 song : you 're nobody till somebody buys you			0
and , increasingly , national companies do n't even have to offer money to people to promote their brands -- people pay their own money to do just that for the companies			2
all the customers who eagerly hand over cash so they can wear the @entity145 swoosh become free ambassadors for the manufacturer			0
at least the hardy souls who wear sandwich boards on city sidewalks to promote stores and products are compensated for doing it			0
objecting to this trend is futile			0
it has been building steadily for years			0
the @entity29 won their first three @entity3 championships while playing in the classically named @entity158 , but their second three championships were won while playing in the new @entity160 , sponsored by the airline , and it just seemed like the way of the world			1
people sometimes bemoan encroaching commercialism inside @entity166 , home of the @entity167 , but that ballpark was , in contemporary parlance , and early adopter of you - ca n't - escape - it advertising , having been named for the man who owned it , a chewing - gum manufacturer			2
if there was a stigma associated with advertising appearing in untraditional places , it is all but gone			0
should the @entity3 decide to go forward with ads on jerseys , the players will probably put up a fight until they get their desired percentage of the income from the sponsors , but that will be negotiated			1
if the players resist , the owners will say : do you want to keep making more money or not ? in professional sports , there is only one thing considered more important than winning , and that is finding new revenue streams			1
the major sports leagues wo n't be the end of this			1
what are two parts of @entity57 life that urgently need an economic boost ? the @entity206 and the financial system itself			1
so perhaps the day will come when top - shelf advertisers are invited to bid for the right to place their logos on postage stamps , and on currency			2
it would be an unbeatable way to pump cash into the postal service and into the @entity218			0
there would be certain complications : @entity221 might not be thrilled if consumers bought its food with dollar bills emblazoned with the @entity226 's arches			0
ground rules would have to be worked out			0
@entity228 , more than a half - century ago , made the plain white t - shirt the ultimate symbol of cool			0
that shirt , in marketing circles , would seem naked now ; where 's the logo ? @entity228 would be seen as foolishly missing a golden opportunity			0
all that potential ad space on his shirt , wasted			0
@entity228 never played in the @entity3 , though			1
enjoy the playoffs this year , and savor the sight of the unadorned jerseys			0
the startling thing is not that a major sport is considering plastering ads on those uniforms			1
the startling thing is that it has taken them this long			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity248 .			1

@entity248 : news report says @entity3 considers putting ads on players ' jerseys
he says none of the four major leagues permits ads on uniforms
people would grow to accept it ; ads have *evolved* into status symbols
@entity248 : it 's about revenue . could ads on stamps help bail out the @entity206 ?
