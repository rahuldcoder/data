it also happens to be @entity32 in @entity33			1
foreign dignitaries , royalty , heads of state , and representatives of other religions will attend			2
security will be on the alert as hymns , chants and prayers fill the square			0
the pope , who plans to deliver his homily in @entity33 , is n't expected to religiously stay within a script			1
he will have prepared comments but , his spokesmen say , he might diverge because he likes to be spontaneous			0
that trait will endear him to the flock but keep security on its toes			0
" the very competent security forces with the pope are there with him			2
they 've been watching him			0
they 'll adapt to his own movements and they will do their best to adapt to new situations , " @entity2 deputy spokesman the rev. @entity58 told reporters			0
" they 're concerned about the protection of the pope , but also the protection of the people that are there as well			2
and this is something brand new , and they will adapt to that because they 're extremely competent and very well prepared , " he said			0
all this comes during one of the busiest times of the year on the @entity13 calendar			0
less than a week away is @entity78 , the holiday that kicks off @entity79 , which culminates in @entity81 celebrations			0
dignitaries stream in @entity2 spokesmen briefing reporters monday stress that dignitaries are welcome to attend the inauguration but , by tradition , they do n't receive a specific invitation			1
@entity93 vice president @entity92 is to lead the @entity93 presidential delegation for the @entity18 , the @entity91 said friday , with @entity96 @entity95 also among the party			2
on friday , house speaker @entity98 , a @entity99 , said he will send a separate bipartisan congressional delegation			0
those delegations are among scores from nations and international organizations traveling to the @entity2 , led by heads of states and governments			0
delegations will be on hand from @entity33 and the pope 's native @entity110			1
there will be other groups from the @entity114 , including @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , and @entity120 nations such as @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123			0
representatives from across @entity13 -- @entity125 and @entity126 -- are expected to be present			2
members of other religions , including @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 , are to be at the inauguration			2
one bit of controversy has emerged : @entity138 president @entity137 , reviled for his human rights abuses , has arrived			1
he is under a @entity141 travel ban , but he can skirt that because he entered @entity33 on religious grounds			1
in power for decades , @entity137 visited the @entity2 in 2011 for the beatification of the late pope @entity145 he attended that pope 's funeral in 2005			1
@entity110 president visits pope @entity19 met at the @entity2 on monday with the leader of his native @entity110 , president @entity150 , a figure with whom @entity19 has clashed publicly over social issues			1
when he was archbishop of @entity154 , @entity19 disagreed with the @entity110 government 's position on same - sex marriage and free distribution of contraceptives			1
but @entity160 sent a letter congratulating him as he assumed his new role			0
the pope 's meeting with @entity160 , which also included lunch , is a sign he 's trying to put the past behind him			2
the pope will bring his @entity110 heritage with him to the @entity2 , adopting the same motto and the coat of arms he used in @entity154			1
after the meeting , @entity160 said she asked the pope to intervene in the dispute between @entity110 and the @entity176 over the @entity177 and help the nations spark a dialogue			1
the two countries went to war over the territory in 1982 after the then - military government in @entity110 landed troops on the islands			1
for more than a year , renewed rhetoric between @entity110 and the @entity176 over the islands has escalated to a fever pitch , with both sides accusing each other of colonialism			1
last week , residents of the @entity193 islands overwhelmingly voted to remain under @entity176 rule			0
@entity160 said she and @entity19 also discussed human trafficking and slavery			1
@entity2 : @entity110 claims defamatory the @entity2 has sought to quell controversy over @entity19 ' conduct during @entity110 's so - called @entity200 from 1976 to 1983 , amid accusations that he could have done more to protect two @entity203 priests who were kidnapped			1
the accusations resurfaced after the @entity110 cardinal 's unexpected election to the papacy last week			1
a book by investigative reporter @entity209 accuses @entity19 , who was then @entity19 and was head of the country 's @entity211 , of deliberately failing to protect the two priests , @entity214 and @entity215 , when they were seized by the navy			1
they were found alive five months later			0
but the rev. @entity218 , the @entity2 's lead spokesman , dismissed the claims as false and defamatory			0
" the campaign against @entity19 is well - known and goes back to many years ago			1
it was promoted by a defamatory publication , " he said at a @entity2 news conference friday			0
" this was never a concrete or credible accusation in his regard			0
he was questioned by an @entity110 court as someone aware of the situation but never as a defendant			1
he has , in documented form , denied any accusations , " @entity218 said			0
" instead , there have been many declarations demonstrating how much @entity19 did to protect many persons at the time of the military dictatorship , " he said			1
his role after he became bishop of @entity154 in asking for forgiveness for the church for not having done enough at the time of the dictatorship " is also well - known , " @entity218 said			0
@entity19 's journey to top of the church first sunday as pope thousands of @entity7 waving flags from around the world packed @entity14 on sunday to hear @entity19 deliver his inaugural angelus			1

" have you thought about the patience that @entity269 has with each of us ? " he made the historic address after celebrating @entity18 at @entity273 in @entity2 earlier sunday			2
@entity7 : 5 ways for @entity19 to move forward reforms to come ? in his first week as pontiff , @entity19 has enjoyed global fanfare as the first @entity279 pope and the first @entity203 pope in modern times			1
in just his first few days , he has prompted speculation that he may bring in wider changes			0
while he decided the heads of the various @entity2 offices will keep their jobs for now , he 's not making any definitive appointments , the @entity2 said saturday			0
@entity1 @entity2 analyst @entity288 , who 's also a correspondent for the @entity289 , said this is the first clear signal that he may be serious about reform			0
" it 's customary for new popes to swiftly reconfirm the department heads who lose their positions when the previous pontificate ends , and then take his time about bringing in his team , " @entity288 said			0
" the fact that @entity19 has not followed that path may suggest that significant personnel moves will come sooner rather than later			2
" @entity19 wants " a certain period for reflection , prayer and dialogue before ( making ) any definitive nomination or confirmation , " a @entity2 statement said			2
