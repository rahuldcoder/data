-- @entity1 says @entity2 might be doomed			1
the " @entity4 " correspondent was recently in @entity5 , where he was hosting a comedy gala called " @entity7 ? " at the famous @entity10 festival			1
and while he emphasized the show title 's punctuation , he also noted that , " the question mark is getting smaller and smaller as the news progresses , particularly today			2
" our video interview took place only a few days before the august 2 debt ceiling deadline so , naturally , we focused on the plight of @entity2 's finances			1
" it does n't really seem to make any sense , logically , " he says			0
" other than pettiness is something that it seems @entity2 is now addicted to			1
and that 's a hard habit to kick			2
" @entity1 also spoke about the members of the tea party , giving them some credit for their role in the conversation , but also questioning what will become of them after the debt ceiling issue is resolved			1
" they have brought to attention that @entity2 is $ 14.3 trillion in debt			1
that 's a lot of dollars			0
that 's more than $ 14			1
and it 's more than $ 14 trillion			1
it 's $ 14.3 trillion			1
so they 've done that			0
they 've pointed that out			0
and now they seem to be , for some reason , wanting things to get worse			0
so i do n't know how they 'll come out of it			0
i guess the same as they went into it -- angry and confused			0
" of course , @entity1 also had a few choice words for the media			1
" the media has , as it 's always done , done a terrible job reporting on this			2
they have seen the fire and they 've decided to throw gasoline on it , " he says			0
" i 'm sure they 're proud of themselves as they always are			0
and that is a misplaced pride			0
" @entity1 , who is @entity68 and works here on a green card , should n't be confused for a gleeful foreigner who relishes in the financial and political hardships of the @entity2			1
perhaps it 's good for his job as a comedian , but , personally , there 's no sense of schadenfreude			2
" i would much rather @entity2 was a more stable , wonderful place			2
you know , i love it			0
but it is odd seeing it do this to itself for no clear reason			0
