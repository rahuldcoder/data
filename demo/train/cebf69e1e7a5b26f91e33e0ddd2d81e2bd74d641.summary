-- after several stints in prison and rehab for heroin addiction , @entity1 was a reformed character , but society did n't want to know			1
after finding it nearly impossible to get a job he decided to forge his own future			1
now , over 20 years since he kicked his drug - habit , the @entity12 is the successful owner of a chain of restaurants called @entity16			2
while the restaurants focus on providing quality food , from the beginning @entity1 was determined that his business venture would also concentrate on helping those marginalized by society			1
" i realized that in society there is this gap			0
where once you have a criminal record you are unable to live a normal life , you are unable to integrate back to society , " he says			0
" we are able to provide training and give them their self - respect which they lost many , many years ago			0
" before setting up eighteen chefs , @entity1 trained at @entity37 , @entity40 's @entity39 restaurant			1
he then went on to run a 200 - seater @entity42 restaurant , with 80 % of the staff having a criminal record			0
however , @entity1 found that the high number of ex-offenders was too difficult to manage			1
his first @entity16 establishment started off with a smaller proportion , 35 % in 2012 , and now 50 % of his employees are troubled young people and people with criminal records			0
there have been a number of success stories among staff , one of @entity1 's employees began as a server and is now a regional manager at an international restaurant earning more than $ 6,000 a month			2
@entity1 does not even mind if his employees steal recipes and ideas from him to start up their own small businesses , he 's just happy they are n't going back to their old ways			1
while his new life is free of his old habits and addictions , his restaurants retain an allusion to his former ways : the number 18 refers to a well - known @entity12 street gang			2
but rather than advocate his breaking bad past , he would rather young people tempted by a thug life would pick up a pan and chopping knife rather than a switchblade .			0

when @entity1 was released from prison it was impossible to find a job
so he decided to start his own chain of restaurants , eighteen chefs
now he gives ex-offenders the chance he never had by employing them
