-- yes , climate change is happening			1
but it 's hard to say that the tornado that ripped through @entity4 , @entity5 -- or any given tornado , for that matter -- was influenced by climate change			1
scientific research has not made a clear connection between tornadoes and climate change , said @entity11 , climate change expert and professor at the @entity14			1
there is currently a much better understanding of how climate change increases the risks of droughts , heat waves and precipitation , he said			1
there are also indications that changing patterns may influence the intensity of hurricanes			0
but as far as tornadoes : there 's just not a lot of information			0
as far as the @entity4 tornado , " this tornadic storm , in my view , probably would have happened irrespective of whether there 's climate change or not , " @entity11 said			1
" the question is : are we increasing the risk and probability of more extreme events in general as our climate differs ? " more research and discussion is needed about future warming and the environments that might produce storms , he said			1
trends in tornado occurrence over the last 50 years do not appear to have changed in conjunction with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and patterns of rising temperatures , @entity11 said			2
beyond the climate change question , meteorologists do n't know a lot about why some thunderstorms produce tornadoes and not others			1
according to the @entity61 , only about 1 % of thunderstorms generate tornadoes			0
however , tornado prediction is advancing and evolving			2
weather , says @entity11 , is like mood -- it changes all the time			0
the deeper underlying forces we call " climate " are like personality			2
greenhouse gases building up in our ocean atmosphere system , from human activity , influence that personality -- which is much harder to undo			0
to put it a different way , a driver who is sober has a certain risk of getting into an accident , said @entity79 , the study 's senior author and director of the @entity82 at @entity84 's @entity83			0
the risk goes up with a couple of drinks			0
similarly , as humans pump more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere , that raises the likelihood of extreme weather events			0
" greenhouse gases are kind of like the alcohol in the system of the climate , " @entity79 said			2
climate change will mean more heat deaths earlier this month , scientists measured for the first time an average carbon dioxide concentration of 400 parts per million at @entity103 in @entity104 , representing a new peak for this iconic monitoring station			1
more space and science news from @entity0 @entity109			0

expert : @entity4 tornado likely would have happened regardless of *global* warming
science has stronger support for connection between climate change and drought , heat wave
more research and discussion is needed about future warming and storms
