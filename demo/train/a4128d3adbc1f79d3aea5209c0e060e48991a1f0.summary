-- no one should be surprised by the technical problems that have plagued the new health insurance exchange website , @entity4 , which allows millions of @entity5 to sign up and buy health coverage			1
but surprised ? do n't be			0
large - scale software projects are hard			1
failures or delays in schedule , budget and functionality are so common as to almost be the norm , not the exception			1
sure , the website rollout could have been handled a lot better			0
with all the delays and warning signs , the government could have stopped touting @entity4 and teasing the public with messages such as " 5 days to open enrollment			1
do n't wait another minute			0
" but the federal government has never had a fantastic track record in dealing with technology projects			1
this was not just an @entity29 problem			0
most of the government has little experience in managing such a big , complex project , and management is a remarkably large part of the effort ; building a system like this takes far more than just programming			1
maybe it should have hired a general contractor to supervise the 55 contractors who worked on the website			0
maybe it should have looked into launching at a later date instead of october 1			0
but the bottom line is that technical glitches are an inescapable part of our digital life			1
we see this in the private sector			0
when @entity56 and @entity57 merged , the combined reservation system did n't work very well at first			0
the new @entity58 at @entity59 outside @entity60 was saddled with software problems			1
nor are tech giants immune ; @entity63 was very late because @entity64 had myriad troubles during development			0
the inherent nature of software is that it demands perfection			1
computers do exactly what they 're told to do			0
even small errors can be disastrous			1
for example , one of the first @entity5 space probes to @entity76 was lost in part because of a single missing hyphen character in a program			1
testing is the next hurdle			2
any project needs adequate time to make sure the software works properly and to find and correct any flaws			1
@entity87 , however , was in short supply with the launch of the online insurance marketplace			2
if development took too long , there would n't be enough time to test it thoroughly			0
that apparently was one of the problems			2
and even when all of the pieces are working fine , the entire system has to be tested ; that ca n't be done until quite late in the process			0
project management also plays a big role			1
it 's very hard to estimate how long a project will take			1
that means it 's hard to know how many programmers to devote to the task , how much it will cost and so on			2
measuring progress is n't easy , either , which means it 's hard to tell how far along you are			2
the worst problem is probably that requirements change while the software is being developed			1
this may mean that you have to redo work you 've already done , but the effects can be more far - reaching			2
it 's like building a house : if the owners suddenly decide they want a big floor - to - ceiling picture window on the second floor , it may require rerouting water pipes			2
that may require moving the ground - floor bathroom , which in turn could affect the kitchen layout , because the bathtub and the kitchen sink share drain pipes			2
part of project management 's job is to say " no " to many change requests , but that 's not always possible			1
what if more computers are added ? that 's not always a solution			0
if the computers have to share access to resources -- say , a database of people who have signed up -- it gets complicated			0
suppose you 've invited many people over for dinner , more than you 've ever hosted before			0
you and your spouse decide to share the preparation and cooking			0
maybe you have sufficient counter space , but you still have only one sink , one stove and one oven			0
with two people , it might be relatively straightforward to take turns , but with three or four or more cooks , it can get crazy			0
finally , there 's the " system integration " problem of combining the different components			0
a system like the insurance exchanges is built in parts			2
eventually , like a jigsaw puzzle , all the pieces have to be put together			0
do the slots and tongues line up properly ? are the right parts of the picture on the right pieces ? did all of the contractors use the same shade of green for the grass ? there are standard approaches , standard tools and standard software for building large - scale websites			1
using them correctly takes good planning and management			1
that was in short supply here			0
the contractors building @entity4 could n't control the budget or the timing for the regulations ; those were the product of @entity199 politics			1
while there are apparent programming and design errors , it 's quite likely that most are the result of requirement changes rather than incompetence			2
the overall failure appears to have been one of project management on the part of the government			1
in the best of all possible worlds , the site would have launched seamlessly to serve the entire nation			2
and politics just makes things messier			0
the @entity221 administration is " excruciatingly " embarrassed and is working hard to get the glitches fixed			1
let 's hope things go more smoothly the next time around			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			1

the new insurance exchange site , @entity4 , has technical problems
@entity227 : large - scale software projects are hard ; glitches are common
he says testing for errors and changing requirements contribute to delays or failures
@entity227 : good project management is a remarkably large part of the effort
