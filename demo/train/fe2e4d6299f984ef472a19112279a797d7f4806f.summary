-- the night before he turned 40 , @entity1 had what he calls a " moment of clarity			1
" overweight and out of shape , @entity1 had to stop to catch his breath while walking up the stairs of his @entity9 home			1
roll , now a father of four , feared he was close to a heart attack			1
that low point prompted the entertainment attorney and former college swimmer to lose weight and get healthy			2
roll not only followed through on his promise to himself and his family , he transformed his body and his life			1
he adopted a vegan or plant - based diet and six months later , with almost no experience , entered the extreme endurance event known as @entity23			1
@entity23 is like a super-size triathlon			1
it 's a three - day race covering 320 miles on the big island of @entity27 , including a 10 - kilometer ocean swim , more than 260 miles by bike and a double marathon run			1
not only did @entity1 finish the race , he placed 11th overall			1
he went on to compete in more endurance events , including @entity33 , finishing five @entity34 on five @entity35 in less than a week			2
his accomplishments have attracted international attention and praise			0
in 2009 , @entity39 named @entity1 one of the " 25 @entity41			1
" roll is telling his amazing and inspirational story in the new book " finding @entity45 : rejecting @entity46 , becoming one of the @entity48 's @entity41 , and @entity49			1
" he 's encouraging everyone , especially middle - aged fathers , to improve their diet , fitness and long - term health			1
he took time out of his busy schedule to talk to @entity0 this week			0
the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : just about five years ago , you turned yourself into one of the fittest men on the planet			0
how are you doing today at age 45 ? @entity1 : i feel fantastic and i continue to learn and refine and try to do it better			1
like most people , my life is busy , and recently with the book i have n't been able to train as regularly as i 've become accustomed to over the past several years			1
so when i 'm not on my schedule the way i like to be , then i do n't feel as good			0
but in the balance of things looking back from 5Â½ years ago to where i am now , it 's nothing short of remarkable			1
if anything i am more a believer than i ever have been in the program that i talk about in the book and have every intention of continuing on this path			0
at the time , five years ago , all i wanted to do was lose a little weight and feel better			0
i had no idea it would lead to the life that i 'm leading now			1
@entity0 : between your family , your job and training , what 's a typical day like for you ? roll : my schedule is different every day			1
often it 's dictated by what the kids have going on and what their activities happen to be so i take a tip from that			1
i try not to be too strict every day because then i get frustrated when things do n't work out the way i want them to			0
so i try to remain open			0
generally , i get up early , i take my kids to school ; then i try to squeeze in a training session , then i get some work done , then i try to squeeze another training session in			0
i 'll pick my kids up from school			0
i 'll work for another couple of hours			0
i 'll have dinner with my kids , and quite often i work late into the night			0
see dr. @entity112 interview @entity1 in 2010 @entity0 : what does it take to make such a major lifestyle change ? is it a question of willpower ? roll : i think it 's a little bit more than that			1
i think the important thing to bear in mind , that 's been incredibly helpful to me in many instances in my life , is to remember that mood follows action			1
i think it 's very easy to say i 'll get to that when i feel better or when i 'm in the right mood , then i 'll do that , or when the universe aligns and everything is perfect , then i 'll dust off that dream , but it never happens			1
the action has to come first			0
you have to take the action before you know where it 's going to lead you without knowing the outcome and irrespective of your mind - set or how you feel at the time			1
that 's key and the other thing is to emphasize the importance of those dreams we all have because life is short , and there 's no time like the present to set them in motion			1
my hope is that people can see through the extreme endurance event aspect of the book and realize that 's purely intended as metaphor			1
not everyone who reads my book will want to do @entity23 or become 100 % vegan , but i hope it serves as inspiration for whatever that thing is you 've had in the back of your mind that you always wanted to do			0
there is a way and a means to breathe life into those things if you 're willing to prioritize it in a way you have n't done before			2
@entity0 : what advice would you give to those inspired after reading your book ? roll : the biggest thing is to not overcomplicate it and just start			2
you do n't have to have the whole thing mapped out			0
you do n't have to know where it 's going to lead you			2
you should n't get caught up in the results of it			0
you just need to begin and embrace the journey and be open to where it 's going to lead you			2
@entity0 : how do you maintain a balance and find time for it all ? roll : balance is very difficult			2
it 's something i 'm always chasing and pursuing			2
i 'm always trying to get that recipe , that chemistry perfect , but the truth is you ca n't do everything every day so something 's got to give			2
i 'm not a professional athlete ; nobody 's paying me to race			2
i do n't make any money doing it			0
i 've made a little bit of money writing the book but not enough to support my family , so i have to work just like everybody else			0
when i 'm training then , i 'm not earning so i have to be reasonable about the whole thing			0
i 'm just like every other dad in that regard			0
@entity0 : you 've accomplished so much in the past five years , but what 's your next goal ? roll : certainly i want to continue to push my body and see what it 's capable of in an athletic concept			1
i love doing that , and i will continue to look for athletic challenges			2
that will be something i will always do , but i would say that my priorities have shifted a little bit			0
now my focus and what 's most important to me professionally is spreading a healthy message			2
i want to help inspire people through the book or get them to make healthier choices about their eating			0
i 'm hoping the book will create a platform for me to be able to go around the country and speak to groups and kids at schools or corporations and get people eating better			0
being able to have a positive impact on somebody 's health , there 's nothing better than that			2
so my hope and my aspiration is to be able to play a small role in trying to create a healthier @entity256			0
