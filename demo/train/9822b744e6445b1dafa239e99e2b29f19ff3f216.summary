a third video emerged wednesday of @entity2 economist @entity1 , one of the architects of the @entity5 , or @entity5 , insulting voters and suggesting their ignorance was exploited by those pushing passage of the health care law			1
neither the @entity11 nor @entity1 would comment			1
in this one , @entity1 was discussing how then - sen. @entity12 , @entity13 , pushed forward a way to add a tax on expensive health insurance plans , or " @entity23 , " that would purportedly tax the insurance companies though @entity1 suggests everyone knew the companies would just pass on the additional cost to customers			1
" it 's a very clever , you know , basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the @entity31 voter , " @entity1 said at the @entity24 2012 at the @entity25			1
the moment is at about 29:25 in this video			0
the video was first reported by @entity35			0
over the weekend , media first became aware of a video of @entity1 making a similar remark -- that the unintelligent voters were hoodwinked by those pushing passage of @entity5 , which was in his view for the good			1
that video , from the @entity46 in 2013 ( which you can see here ) featured @entity1 saying , " if you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in -- if you made it explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money , it would not have passed , ok ? just like how people -- transparent -- lack of transparency is a huge advantage			1
and basically , you know , call it the stupidity of the @entity31 voter or whatever			0
but basically that was really , really critical to getting the thing to pass			0
" @entity1 said he wished " we could make it all transparent			1
but i 'd rather have this law than not			2
" asked for reaction to the video , senator - elect @entity69 , @entity70 , told the lead that it sounded like @entity1 was arguing that " the ends justify the means ... that is exactly what the @entity31 people are tired of			1
they want to be treated with respect			0
we did a lot of very difficult bills since i 've been speaker of the house ( of the @entity85 legislature )			0
some of them were controversial on both sides of the ideological spectrum			0
but we took the time to explain it to people and not do this sort of bob and weave			0
" on tuesday , @entity1 went on @entity94 to offer a mea culpa			1
" i was speaking off the cuff and i spoke inappropriately , and i regret making those comments , " he said			2
but then more videos emerged			0
last night , @entity99 on @entity100 showed another excerpt of a @entity1 lecture , this from @entity103 at @entity104 in 2013 , where he said " they proposed it and that passed , because the @entity31 people are too stupid to understand the difference			2
" the videos were documented over the course of the last year by @entity110 , an investment adviser who became interested in the origins of the law after the price of insurance for his family doubled			2
@entity110 tells @entity116 he has many more videos in his collection .			0

economist @entity1 is considered one of the architects of the @entity5
a series of videos of @entity1 show him suggesting voters were *fooled* into *backing* the law
