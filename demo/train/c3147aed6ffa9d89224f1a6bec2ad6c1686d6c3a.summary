gruesome and seemingly endless accounts of violence in @entity2 have obscured one notable bright spot in @entity5 's high - stakes struggle with powerful drug gangs			1
in @entity15 , once home to the world 's biggest cocaine cartels , new crime organizations are being picked apart with silent efficiency -- aided by @entity13 's enthusiastic embrace of extradition			1
in recent years , more than 1,300 of @entity15 's top crime bosses and their most dangerous enforcers have been sent north to face trafficking charges in the @entity19 , a dramatic turnabout from the 1990s when extradition was outlawed under coercive pressure from the @entity24 and @entity25 cartels			1
traffickers who might have continued to operate their drug organizations from luxury prison cells near their @entity15 homes find themselves serving extended terms far away in @entity19 penitentiaries without wall - to - wall carpets , big - screen tvs or easy phone access			1
many offer to become witnesses hoping to reduce their sentences			0
the result has been a steady erosion of organized crime 's capabilities in @entity15 -- a lesson for @entity2 and other countries in the region threatened by drug gangs			1
@entity2 's historic reluctance to extradite its citizens to the @entity19 should be reassessed in the face of @entity15 's success			1
the beauty of extradition as practiced by @entity15 is not its power to stop drug smuggling			1
there is scant evidence it has had much direct effect in that regard			0
but it continues to splinter the leadership of trafficking gangs , keeping them in a perpetual state of rebuilding			0
in short , extradition disorganizes organized crime			2
and that 's what makes it such a winning strategy in a country once thoroughly compromised by cartel threats and bribes			2
in those days , barely 20 years ago , the @entity24 and @entity25 cartels vied for power with the @entity13 government that too often seemed to be a hostage to criminal forces			2
extradition became the prize they fought over			0
@entity80 , once the most feared thug in the drug world , was so afraid of being carted off for trial in @entity83 or @entity84 or @entity85 that he demanded an end to extradition			2
he famously insisted that he preferred " the grave in @entity15 " to a prison cell in the @entity19			1
but when his demands were unheeded , @entity80 launched a terror campaign of political assassination , socialite kidnappings , and deadly bombings			0
while @entity80 went to war , rival @entity25 cartel bosses went to the bank			0
they spread favors of cash , women and @entity102 vacations to any and all receptive politicians			0
democracy was no match for the combined forces of corruption and intimidation			0
@entity15 capitulated to the drug kings and let cartel lawyers rewrite portions of the national constitution to outlaw extradition			1
it was banned for more than six years until restored in december 1997			0
more recently , its use soared as part of former president @entity117 's campaign to disarm and demobilize narco - trafficking paramilitary groups			0
and he put extradition processing on a fast track after discovering that imprisoned gangsters were still running criminal enterprises from their @entity15 jails			2
@entity15 remains highly motivated today by fear of a return to the bad old days when criminal demands trumped national interests			2
and its success has been noticed			0
@entity2 is showing more willingness to extradite @entity2 nationals accused of major trafficking offenses in the @entity19 , but its numbers are small compared with @entity15 's			1
about a dozen @entity2 drug bosses are in various stages of extradition , a cumbersome and often frustrating process that can take two to five years			1
@entity19 authorities complain that , among other things , @entity2 requires excessive documentation before approving extradition applications -- notably the identities of certain key witnesses that can jeopardize their safety			1
some of the lingering reluctance comes from national pride , from the conviction that @entity2 should and can take care of its own crime problems			2
to that end , @entity2 anti-narcotics units have been beefed up and security at its federal prisons improved			2
but that 's not enough			0
" there 's no prison anywhere in @entity2 or @entity15 that puts these guys out of business like @entity19 prisons , " says one @entity19 law enforcement official			1
there is a cost , of course			0
federal prosecutions and extended incarcerations are expensive			0
yet , what are the alternatives ? when @entity15 was overrun by cartels , the @entity19 poured in a billion dollars of aid to help a friend and ally fight back			1
recently , @entity84 gov. @entity173 suggested sending @entity19 troops to help @entity2 , an option loaded with political as well as financial costs			1
it only underscores the point : extradition is a bargain			0
it 's also the most potent weapon against organized crime available in the region			0
@entity2 and its @entity185 neighbors should embrace it with @entity15 enthusiasm			1
@entity188 : what i saw inside the @entity25 cartel join @entity192 on @entity193 and follow updates on @entity195			0

@entity197 : @entity15 is fighting drug lords by allowing extradition to @entity19
@entity197 : extradition does **n't** stop smuggling , but it damages cartels
traffickers in @entity19 cells ca **n't** run operations from luxury prisons in @entity15 , he says
@entity197 says @entity2 should take lessons from @entity15 's successful strategy
