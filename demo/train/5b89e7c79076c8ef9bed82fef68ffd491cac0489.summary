-- a drought in @entity2 has lowered the @entity3 , leaving its southern tip awash in saline from the @entity6 and prompting health officials in @entity8 to issue a drinking water advisory			1
" the water 's perfectly safe to drink , " said @entity10 , director of the parish 's @entity11 and @entity13 , in a telephone interview wednesday			1
" it 's just got the elevated salt			2
" with the mighty @entity3 near its all - time low , the salty water has crept in as a wedge , he said			1
because salty water is denser than fresh , it tends to collect at lower depths , he said			1
watch dryness overtake @entity25 but pipes that pull drinking water from the river tend to draw from those same depths , @entity10 said			1
the logical fix would be simply to raise the pipes , but that would be tough to do			0
" you 're talking about large pipes that have been down there for years and years and years , " he said			0
the wedge has been moving up the @entity3 since early this month , reaching mile marker 89 -- signifying that many miles from the river mouth -- by wednesday , @entity10 said			1
" you can taste a little salt water content , " he said			0
" but it 's nothing that 's harmful			0
" anyone on dialysis and / or low - sodium diets was urged to check with a health care provider about drinking parish water			1
@entity48 , of course , is sodium chloride			0
neither sodium nor chloride is considered a known health threat , the parish said , citing @entity55 data			0
chloride , considered a secondary contaminant , could affect drinking water 's taste , smell and color			1
@entity55 's secondary maximum contaminant level for chloride is 250 mg / l. the maximum chloride detected in drinking water in the @entity66 area was 362 mg / l , it said			1
sodium is classified neither as a primary nor secondary contaminant , but it can adversely affect people on low - sodium diets for health reasons , such as high - blood pressure or kidney disease , the @entity55 said			1
sodium levels in the parish 's drinking water ranged from 60 mg / l to 200 mg / l -- far exceeding the @entity55 recommendation of no more than 20 mg / l for people on very low sodium diets			1
meanwhile , the @entity81 started work wednesday on an $ 8 million underwater levee -- positioned at mile marker 64 , just below @entity85 -- to stop the wedge 's progress , as it did with success during a similar drought 24 years ago			2
" it 's a sill , " @entity10 said			0
" it ( the salt water ) runs into that levee just as if it was a dry wall			0
" interactive map : drought conditions he predicted the effects of the sill will become apparent on the salinity of the water within the week			2
in addition to creating the sill , officials are planning to take 2.5 million gallons of fresh water from farther north in the river -- past mile marker 100 -- then carry it by barge southward " and suck it into our water treatment facilities , " @entity10 said			2
the salt water in the river has had a benefit for some anglers : " the redfish follow it up , so we 're able to fish right in the @entity3 now instead of having to go to the gulf , " he said			2
the drought 's impact has had effects that extend beyond the river			1
it led the @entity25 @entity121 on wednesday to designate four @entity2 parishes and seven contiguous parishes as natural disaster areas			0
@entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 parishes were declared primary natural disaster areas			0
the seven parishes named as contiguous disaster areas were : @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 , according to the @entity140			0
according to the department , 63 % of the nation 's hay acreage and about 73 % of cattle acreage are in drought areas , as are about 87 % of @entity25 corn and 85 % of soybeans			2
