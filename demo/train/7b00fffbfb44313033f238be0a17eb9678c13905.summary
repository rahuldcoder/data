@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 has created a " climate of fear " among political activists and journalists working on the island nation , according to a report released wednesday by the human rights group @entity7			1
" the laws are so vague that almost any act of dissent can be deemed criminal in some way , making it very difficult for activists to speak out against the government , " @entity10 , the group 's deputy @entity11 director , said in a statement			1
the @entity23 - based organization reported that the country 's court system and penal codes are used to stifle dissent and urged the government to release what it identified as 53 " prisoners of conscience			0
" the @entity1 government was not immediately available for comment but has traditionally viewed dissidents as mercenaries in the pay of foreign governments			1
@entity1 points to a series of clandestine actions by the @entity40 that it says were designed to topple the country 's leadership and overthrow a government installed by former @entity1 president @entity45 in 1959			2
the @entity7 report described the resulting 48 year - old @entity40 trade embargo against the communist government as a " lame excuse " that @entity1 leaders use to justify violating human rights			1
@entity7 acknowledged that its reporting is based on " independent sources			0
" it has no first - hand research on the island since being banned by the @entity1 government in 1990			2
the country 's human rights record came under intense scrutiny earlier this year after jailed @entity1 dissident @entity59 died following a prolonged hunger strike			0
@entity62 's death sparked international condemnation from @entity64 and @entity65 and drew a rare statement of regret from @entity1 president @entity68			0
but a recent series of transfers of prisoners to jails closer to their homes , and the release of two political dissidents , have raised questions about whether @entity1 is slowly changing policy toward its political prisoners			0
last week 's release of jailed activist @entity80 follows a meeting between president @entity45 and @entity84 foreign minister @entity83 , whose visit came amid signs of growing influence by @entity1 's @entity88			1
in may , @entity1 's @entity88 cardinal , @entity89 , described a rare four - hour meeting with president @entity45 as a " magnificent start " to talks centered around the potential release of some of the island 's jailed dissidents			2
church officials and human rights groups continue to express their desire for more prisoner releases .			0

@entity7 says @entity1 government has created " climate of fear "
group says laws are so vague almost any dissent is *illegal* in some way
prisoner transfers , releases seem to hint at policy change
@entity88 's influence *apparently* growing
