-- i like to joke that the difference between other places i 've lived and @entity4 is that seeing a goat or a chicken used to be a field trip ; now it 's my commute			0
humor aside , though , one of the perks of living much closer to farmland is the access that we have to amazingly fresh food			2
i have n't always been the healthiest of eaters , but in recent years that has changed			1
two summers ago , we participated in a " farm share , " where every week we would get a box of organically raised produce			1
it 's not an understatement to say that this completely redefined the eating habits of my family			2
we went from a meat - heavy diet to a much more vegetable - oriented one			0
my wife became much more concerned with how our food was raised and processed			2
before long , she was near - obsessed with whether our food was " organic			1
" we 're not alone			0
organic food , or food grown without synthetic pesticides , fertilizers , antibiotics or hormones , now accounts for more than $ 31 billion in sales each year			1
more than 4 % of all food sold is organic , and whole industries have sprung up around its production and sale			1
most people who buy organic food do so for its purported health benefits			1
often , people will claim that it 's more natural production leads to better nutrition			2
others cite pesticides and other substances in nonorganic food as being hazardous to your health			1
those who believe this are willing to pay a premium ( and organic food usually comes with one ) for those benefits			1
a recent study , though , calls into question whether those benefits are actually real			2
in this month 's @entity62 , a manuscript examined all the studies published in the medical literature from 1996 through 2009 that compared organic and conventionally grown food			1
there were 223 such studies that compared these foods for nutrient and contaminant content			0
there were no significant differences in vitamin content between organic and nonorganic foods			2
of the 11 other nutrients studied , none were significantly different once adjustments were made for study quality			2
although some differences existed between levels of detectable pesticides , in only three studies did contamination exceed the maximum allowed limits , and none of those were in the @entity89			0
there was no statistically significant difference in bacterial contamination , fungal toxins or heavy metal contaminations			0
an additional 17 studies looked at the effect of organic and nonorganic foods in human beings			0
three looked at whether organic foods in pregnant women and children might protect against allergies ( they did n't overall )			1
two found that children on organic diets had lower organophosphates ( compounds used in herbicides and pesticides ) ] in their urine , but no actual health benefits could be detected from that difference			1
of the 11 reports in nonpregnant adults , only one reported a clinical outcome			0
it turned out that people who ate organic meat in the winter were more likely to get a campylobacter infection , which could lead to food poisoning			1
this is a lot of research			0
i 've done systematic reviews before , and i can tell you that reviewing hundreds of studies is not only a lot of work , but it also shows that this domain has been researched extensively			0
organic food has almost no evidence showing health benefits			1
this comes as no surprise to many detractors of organic food			1
none other than @entity139 , who arguably saved more lives than any other person in human history by deveolping disease resistant , high - yielding plant varieties ( earning him a @entity146 peace prize in 1970 ) , claimed that organic food was " ridiculous			1
" he , along with others , has long argued that there is no way to feed the world 's population without chemical fertilizers and technological advancements , and that with no proven benefits from avoiding those components , we are only hurting ourselves and the chance of others to eat cheaply and easily by advocating for them			0
i 'm sure many of you who believe in the benefits of organic food are similarly unimpressed			1
the continued focus on organic food has potential problems , though			1
because it does n't use as many fertilizers , organic farming requires more land to grow the same amount of food as conventional industrial farming			1
a @entity176 article asserted " nothing has been more disruptive to the planet 's ecosystem and its inhabitants than agriculture , " and included in its assessment organic farming			0
organic farming can even result in a disrupted ecosystem , according to one report			0
moreover , some scientific advancements have even engineered food with more nutrients than organic farming produces			2
making healthy food more expensive also potentially puts it out of reach of those with limited means			1
i 've watched this debate intensify in the last week			0
this is a subject that stirs deep passions in both those who favor and disdain organic foods			0
i think we 're missing the point , though			0
the benefit of organic food is that it tends to help us to eat more healthily			1
but it 's the focus toward fruits , vegetables and less processed foods themselves that 's the benefit , not the lack of pesticides			2
my eating habits changed because i was eating a wider variety of healthy foods -- and they tasted good			2
that 's not because of how they were fertilized as much as it was that they were fresh and nonindustrial			0
once you 've tasted a home - grown tomato , then the ones you buy in the store are never tolerable again			0
people who try locally grown produce are often amazed at the difference in taste			1
it turned out that i liked some vegetables more than i knew , and that helped me to want to eat them more			0
the current argument over organic food is somewhat of a waste			2
most of those people who are quibbling over it are already eating reasonably well			0
they do n't need the extra benefits , even if they did exist			0
but there are whole swaths of people out there who have never had a locally grown vegetable , and think they 're all tasteless those are the people who might benefit from changes in diet			1
if we could focus on the added benefits of more vegetables and less meat period , and recognize that organic food might help convert some from one to the other , then we 've won			1
perhaps more backyard growing when possible , or farm shares when not , might do the trick			0
we should celebrate good food for what it is -- good tasting and good for you			0
we should spend less time arguing over minutiae that are irrelevant both in theory and in practice			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity266 .			2

@entity266 : a local " farm share " program *introduced* his family to local grown produce
it changed the way they ate . new study shows little health benefit to organically grown food
he says organically grown food takes up more space , can price out people who ca n't afford it
@entity266 : better to focus on getting people to eat healthy food at all , not *necessarily* organic
