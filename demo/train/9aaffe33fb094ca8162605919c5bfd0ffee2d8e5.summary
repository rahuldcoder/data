-- a mysterious mechanical man with the ability to write and draw holds a place of honor in " @entity5 , " @entity7 's exquisite adaptation of @entity10 's magical , award - winning children 's book " @entity11			1
" and the author 's description of the automaton 's construction -- '' a cascade of perfect movements , with hundreds of brilliantly calibrated actions '' -- is an equally good way to describe @entity7 's achievement in making art that uses the most advanced of @entity23 technology to sing a song of love to the movies , from the very dawn of the medium			2
for a lay audience , the result is a haunting , piquant melodrama about childhood dreams and yearnings , enhanced with a pleasant survey course in early film history			1
( it made me cry , without guilt			2
) for more advanced cinephiles , the result is a cabinet of wonders in which each shot , each experiment in @entity23 perspective , and , indeed , each scene in the story 's progression can be linked to what we already know about @entity7 , his work , and his well - known cinematic passions			1
a niggler might note that every element is at times an eensy bit too perfectly meshed and worked over			2
today , i do n't feel like niggling			0
@entity5 is played with jolting melodramatic pathos -- and the genetic blessing of bottomless , pale blue eyes -- by @entity59 ( " @entity60 " )			1
he is a sad young orphan who keeps the clocks running in a bustling 1930s @entity63 train station patrolled by a limping gendarme			0
( as hammed up by @entity66 , the character constitutes one of the movie 's few tonal dissonances			0
) @entity5 is also the patient tinkerer who works after hours in his clock - tower hideaway repairing the automaton , gear by gear			1
then a bitter train - station toy - shop keeper ( @entity79 at his best ) and his intrepid goddaughter ( " @entity77 ) set the boy on a path of discovery			0
" @entity5 " both ticks and flies by , a marvel meant to be pulled from the cabinet and enjoyed again and again			1
