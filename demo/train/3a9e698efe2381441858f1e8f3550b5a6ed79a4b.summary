-- by now , we have all heard the allegations made by numerous women that @entity4 sexually assaulted them			1
at least 15 have accused him of abuse , with the first incident in the late 1960s and the last in 2004			0
while his attorneys have denied most of these assertions , @entity4 has publicly refused to comment			1
in fact just a few weeks ago , @entity4 not only declined to answer an @entity14 reporter 's question about the claims , he told the reporter that he would appreciate it if any reference to the allegations not appear in the story			1
so now what ? well , it 's not likely @entity4 will be criminally prosecuted			1
the only alleged incident that clearly falls within the criminal statute of limitations is the one involving @entity26			2
that event purportedly took place in 2004 in @entity29 , a state that provides victims with 12 years to file a criminal complaint in sexual assault cases			1
but do n't count on seeing a criminal action			0
in part , because the prosecutor did n't find sufficient evidence to prosecute back in 2005			0
in addition , @entity4 paid an undisclosed sum to @entity39 in 2006 to settle the civil lawsuit arising from the alleged sexual assault			1
i can tell you as a former trial lawyer that that civil settlement would have , without a doubt , included a release by @entity26 of all claims against @entity4 , including criminal			1
@entity4 's career has been deeply damaged by the ongoing scandal and he has been denounced pretty much everywhere			2
is there something that he could do now that could persuade the millions of people who were once his fans to potentially see him again as a comedian , not as a serial rapist -- which is how i now see him ? i posed this question on social media : what do we want from @entity4 now ? the responses revealed an interesting cross section of opinion from men and women on all sides of the issue			1
and while they varied greatly , a common theme emerged			0
but before i mention that one , here are some of the often thought - provoking comments i received in response to the question			0
nothing i suppose ... nothing he could say justifies anything he has done @ germanphile ... he should 100 % retire so his victims never have to be reminded of his presence again @ @entity86 want to hear how could criticize blacks for years knowing he had these demons in his closet ! @ @entity91 : leave him alone			0
@ @entity93 " make a massive donation to a rape prevention program			1
" comment on @entity97 from @entity98 if he 's guilty , which it seems that he is , then he deserves to go to prison for his crimes regardless of his age			0
@ wmzraz " he should apologize to his victims			2
maybe pay compensation as well			0
" comment on @entity97 from @entity107			0
... we must turn tragedy into teachable moment			0
@ kthalps car battery , jumper cables and a narcoleptic switchwoman @ maverick_kris these comments truly reflect the range of responses i received , with many advocating @entity4 be imprisoned and a few defending him			2
but the most common reaction was this : " tell the truth ! " comment on @entity97 from @entity122 ownership ... and not just of stock in jello			0
@ @entity126 acknowledge that even if you 're innocent , your silence is damaging everything you stood for , even the good things @ @entity131 i would like him to address it and stop hiding			2
@ @entity135 it 's clear that people , regardless of where they stand on the issue , want @entity4 to publicly and directly address the claims			1
after all , @entity4 has made his living for decades speaking to the public as a comedian ; his silence adds to the sense that he 's hiding something			2
but this silence appears calculated			0
perhaps he thought we would collectively move on when the next big story came along			0
or maybe he banked on the fact that when three women came forward in the mid- 2000s to make similar allegations of sexual misconduct , we simply did n't seem to care			2
sadly , i was among those who did n't pay much attention			0
silence this time wo n't work for @entity4			1
already he has lost tv deals with @entity160 and @entity161			0
his reputation is in shambles			0
and while @entity4 has escaped criminal prosecution , it 's clear that in the court of public opinion , many have found @entity4 guilty			2
will @entity4 ever come forward and address the issues head on ? unlikely			1
but the upside to this incident , if one can be found , is that the allegations have raised awareness about sexual assault			1
in fact , the @entity174 , an organization that combats sexual assault , said last monday that the national publicity over the @entity4 scandal has caused a 50 % increase in phone calls to the @entity174			1
it appears that the courageous women who have come forward with these allegations against @entity4 have inspired other women to report sexual assaults that they have endured			1
and maybe , just maybe , the media attention concerning the allegations against @entity4 will even save some women from suffering the same fate in the future .			1

@entity189 : @entity4 likely wo n't face charges in sex assault allegations
he asked on social media : what do we want from @entity4 ?
some said give money to rape prevention programs , apologize , compensate alleged victims
@entity189 : unlikely @entity4 will address the issue , but one good thing : our awareness is raised
