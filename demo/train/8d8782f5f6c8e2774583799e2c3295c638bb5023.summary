@entity0 -- thousands of people filled @entity0 's @entity3 on saturday to mark the 22nd anniversary of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in @entity7			1
the candlelight vigil comes after recent efforts by the @entity11 government to quash would - be demonstrators from holding anti-government protests			1
about 26 people were arrested between february and march , according to a @entity0 - based human rights group , when an anonymous group began an internet campaign calling for anti-government protests in @entity11 similar to ones that have taken hold in the @entity21			1
in response to the campaign , authorities deployed heavy security along major thoroughfares , especially in @entity27 , a busy shopping street in downtown @entity28 that had been designated by the online group for protests			0
the government also tightened rules on foreign reporters , explicitly warning them that they risk detention , suspension of press cards and expulsion if they show up at planned demonstrations			2
20 years on : tiananmen remembered saturday 's protest is an annual event organized by the @entity42 , a pro-democracy group			1
@entity0 police called it a " peaceful gathering			1
" images of the demonstration showed a sea of flickering candles covering the length of the park			0
a little more than 22 years ago , students gathered in @entity7 to memorialize the recently deceased @entity53			0
he was fired as @entity55 chief in 1987 by @entity56 for pushing policies deemed too soft toward " bourgeois - liberal ideas " and tolerating student protests			0
the april 15 memorial quickly turned into a pro-democracy movement , and students held talks with the government and later a hunger strike in @entity7 to press their cause			1
on june 4 , 1989 , @entity11 troops in armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled toward @entity7			0
the soldiers , on strict orders to clear the square of demonstrators , had forced their way through the city 's main thoroughfare			2
along the way , they met fierce resistance from students and city residents who barricaded the streets , so they fired at them			0
when the firing stopped , hundreds if not thousands of people lay maimed or dead			0
relatives of victims renew their hopes every year that @entity28 's leaders will reverse the verdict that the protests were a counter-revolutionary rebellion that had to be put down			2
