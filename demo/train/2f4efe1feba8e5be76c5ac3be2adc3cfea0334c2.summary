the event was held on the @entity13 , the ship that was the scene of the raid , which led to the deterioration of relations between @entity17 and @entity18 , its once strong @entity20 ally			1
@entity13 -- owned by the @entity21 , or @entity22 -- and five other ships were on their way to @entity7 carrying humanitarian aid and about 700 activists from various countries when @entity5 soldiers swarmed aboard it in international waters on the night of may 30 - 31 , 2010			1

we call on all states , the @entity68 and international organizations to support our action and demand that @entity17 refrain from attacking our vessels			2
" @entity62 opened its border crossing into @entity7 on saturday			2
it had been mostly kept closed after @entity75 , an @entity76 militant group , got control of @entity7 in june 2007			1
asked if the flotilla organizers are taking any measures to protect the people on board the ships in case of an @entity5 raid , @entity85 , representing the @entity32 boat that will be a part of this year 's flotilla , told @entity0 , " there is not much we can do			1

chants of " @entity17 " were interspersed with @entity102 - and @entity18 - language @entity76 music as people waved @entity105 and @entity18 flags at the event , which also was organized by the @entity107			0
the crowd , including men , women and children , carried banners saying " @entity7 , " " @entity13 martyrs are our honor " and " @entity115 will win			1
