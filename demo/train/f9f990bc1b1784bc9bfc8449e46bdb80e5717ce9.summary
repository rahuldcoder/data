@entity21 , a body which advises on rules for international equestrian competitions , branded the treatment of the horse , which started the race 15 meters behind @entity4 , as a " disgrace "			1
" @entity21 are appalled at the way the jockey used the whip which was not only completely unnecessary but utterly barbaric , " the organization told @entity29			1
" excessive whip use like this is a disgrace to racing as a sport			2
we applaud the achievements of @entity4 and his race could have been a great spectacle , but instead it was marred by the flagrant abuse of this horse			2
" prior to the race against @entity4 , @entity21 had said it had no problem with the horse competing providing it was treated fairly			2
" we commented on the race beforehand to say we did n't see any immediate welfare concerns providing the horse was treated well			0
clearly it was n't , " said the body 's deputy chief executive @entity48			0
in a statement to @entity29 , six - time @entity5 gold medalist @entity4 -- who also reached the semifinals of the @entity10 400 meters competition -- said he was unaware of any ill treatment to the horse			1
" i participated in the race in good faith as it was to promote abilities across sport and i was totally unaware of any alleged excessive force being used on the horse , " said the 26 - year - old			2
" i do n't condone any ill - treatment of animals and would always hope that a horse would be ridden in the correct way			0
