the state attorney overseeing the probe into the shooting death of 17 - year - old @entity3 is known in @entity4 as a tough prosecutor ready to pursue what she believes is right , even in the face of media glare and public pressure			1
no stranger to controversial terrain , @entity10 spent more than 25 years as an assistant state attorney , trying hundreds of cases			1
in 2008 she was elected the top prosecutor in the three counties of the 4th @entity17 , in @entity4 's northeast corner			2
since then , @entity19 , 57 , has made waves for the number of cases she brings to trial			2
she 's also rejected heated criticism , particularly over her prosecution of a 12 - year - old boy for murder			1
@entity19 is trying him as an adult			1
@entity19 " lives up to every prosecutor 's mantra to be ' tough on crime , ' " wrote @entity30 and @entity31 , criminology professors at the @entity33 , in a study published this year			1
in 2010 , @entity41 , which @entity19 oversees , " had the highest incarceration rate of any jurisdiction over 500,000 in @entity4 , " the professors note			2
from 2008 through 2011 , @entity41 's average daily jail population rose from 3,725 to 3,990 ( an increase of 7.1 % ) , according to the study			2
@entity19 's record shows she chooses cases based not only on possibility for success at trial , but also " wherever charges seem warranted , " the study says			0
the depiction of @entity19 as one of the state 's toughest prosecutors is likely welcome news to those who believe @entity58 should be charged			0
@entity58 , a neighborhood watch volunteer , says he shot @entity3 in self - defense february 26			1
@entity19 has described @entity3 's family as " lovely people			0
" she said she has met with them and prayed with them and promised to get them answers			0
@entity4 gov. @entity66 appointed @entity19 to take over after state attorney @entity67 stepped aside amid complaints over his handling of the case			1
@entity67 's 18th @entity17 includes @entity71 , where the shooting took place			0
@entity66 announced that he and attorney general @entity75 " have full faith " in @entity19 to handle the case , which is playing out under a microscope amid worldwide media attention			1
but @entity19 has detractors as well , who cast her as too aggressive			1
three petitions on the website change.org , calling for her to be removed from office , have about 2,500 signatures combined			0
one complains that she prosecutes too many cases without adequate regard for the facts			0
a petition calling for 12 - year - old @entity91 to be treated as a juvenile rather than an adult has nearly 185,000 signatures			1
he is accused of violently killing his 2 - year - old brother			1
@entity19 has said she has compassion for @entity91 , but that " it 's not my job to forgive			0
" and the two professors state in their report that @entity19 's propensity for bringing charges " poses great strain on the system and there has already been conflict between ms. @entity10 's office and the sitting judges due to the increased caseload			1
even sitting judges agree that it 's ms. @entity10 's office driving the higher incarceration			1
" on her 2008 campaign website , @entity19 vowed to " continue my excellent working relationship with law enforcement so that together we can vigorously fight crime			1
only then can we make our community among the safest in the nation			0
" it 's a commitment she has expressed in interviews with @entity125 and @entity126 about the @entity3 case			2
" every aspect of both the shooter and the victim will be looked at and analyzed as it relates to the evidence in this case , " @entity19 vowed to @entity126			2
discussing @entity4 's " stand your ground " law -- which allows people to use deadly force in situations in which they feel a reasonable threat of death or serious injury -- @entity19 said , " our laws are very clear that it has to be a forcible felony and that a reasonable person would have to believe that deadly force is necessary as opposed to just physical force , fighting back and that sort of thing			0
i 've prosecuted a woman who shot her husband and killed him because he slapped her , and we argued that was not deadly force and she was convicted and sent to state prison			0
" the " political outcry " over the @entity3 case makes prosecutors ' work harder , she said			2
" we would hope that people would give us a chance to get this task that the governor has given us accomplished , " she told @entity125			2
" we will leave no stone unturned in our quest to seek justice for @entity3 and for his parents			0
" a native of @entity169 , @entity4 , @entity19 is active in the @entity170 and her @entity171			0
she got her legal degree at the @entity175 and began her legal career at a private firm specializing in insurance defense			0
she joined the state attorney 's office in 1981 .			0

@entity10 lives up to the " tough on crime " mantra , two criminologists say
governor said he has " full faith " in her , but critics describe her as too aggressive
the case of a 12 - year - old to be tried as an adult *sparked* controversy
