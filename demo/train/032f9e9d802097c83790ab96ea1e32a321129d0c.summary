-- update : @entity3 's @entity2 reported friday , that it is satisfied " that while this was a reportable event , and both pilots were concerned they were suffering symptoms of severe fatigue and took controlled rest separately , they did not fall asleep at the same time			1
" previous update published on september 26 , 2013 -- 2247 gmt ( 0647 hkt ) : cruising at 30,000 feet , pilots snoozed in the cockpit of a 300 - passenger airliner en route to @entity3 last august , @entity3 aviation authorities told @entity0 on thursday			1
a spokesman for the @entity3 's @entity2 tells @entity0 that the @entity18 incident occurred while the aircraft was operating on autopilot on a long - distance flight			1
the @entity2 would n't reveal any other details of the flight , its route or its destination airport			0
sources told @entity0 's @entity27 the airline is @entity29			1
the airline in a statement said , " @entity29 can confirm no safety reports have been received about pilots falling asleep simultaneously whilst in control of an aircraft			1
" @entity3 pilots are allowed to sleep while in the cockpit under certain circumstances			1
the august 13 incident appears to be the result of bad scheduling by the airline , said the @entity2 spokesman @entity43			2
the pilots reported having only five hours of sleep over two nights " due to longer duty period with insufficient opportunity to sleep , " the @entity2 report states			1
" both crew rested for 20 minute rotations and fell asleep			2
" the aircraft apparently arrived at its destination safely			0
it 's the first @entity3 incident of its kind in two years , said @entity43			1
he said it 's unlikely the pilots will be disciplined			2
" you ca n't have five hours of sleep in two days , " says veteran airline pilot and aviation consultant @entity59			1
" that does n't work			0
" fatigue ranks among the most sensitive issues in the pilot community			2
rules surrounding sleep and relief crews vary from country to country			2
@entity72 , general secretary of the @entity73 , used the incident to blast the @entity2 's record on pilot fatigue in a statement thursday , accusing it of being " far too complacent about the levels of tiredness among @entity3 pilots and failing to acknowledge the scale of the underreported problem			1
" next week , the @entity83 is expected to vote on new @entity85 rules regulating pilot flying hours			2
@entity72 said the proposed rules will increase " tiredness among pilots and the risk of dangerous incidents			0
" in the @entity92 , flights longer than eight hours require a relief pilot on board to take over so pilots can take a break to sleep			1
if the flight is scheduled to last more than 12 hours , an additional @entity98 must be added			0
should cockpit sleeping be allowed ? believe it or not , some experts say pilots sleeping at the controls is n't always dangerous			2
aviation rules in some nations allow pilots to nap in the cockpit during ultra-long - haul flights -- across oceans , for instance			1
rules vary , but generally , the sleeping pilot must be supervised by another pilot during the naps			0
there are also backup alarm systems in place to awaken pilots if an emergency arises			0
the @entity2 refused to tell @entity0 whether it has evidence that both pilots were asleep simultaneously			1
the report is ambiguous , the agency says			0
if both pilots at the controls had fallen asleep simultaneously , @entity29 would be required to file a report with the @entity2			1
the airline told @entity0 that it has no record of both pilots falling asleep at the same time			1
it 's possible the pilots were resting one at a time under an authorized cockpit napping program			1
among @entity92 pilots , cockpit napping violates @entity139 rules			2
but some experts , including @entity59 , favor the idea			0
" this is a personal belief , " he said , " but i would rather have somebody take a nap during a cruise part of a flight so that pilot would be at peak performance during a high - traffic situation or a landing			0
" unauthorized cockpit napping among @entity92 pilots is n't " that prevalent , " @entity59 says , " but that 's not to say it does n't happen			2
" @entity155 , who was with @entity156 for 19 years , headed a @entity158 / @entity139 study that recommended the @entity139 allow cockpit napping			0
but the @entity139 has never adopted the idea			0
" i think it 's political , " he told @entity0			0
" i guess it 's difficult to tell the public that the captain is asleep on the flight deck			0
" " everyone i talk to who uses it says it 's a stopgap measure to improve safety and reduce the risk of sleep loss			0
" studies have shown , @entity59 says , that taking a 20 - minute nap will allow pilots to regain energy			0
" it 's not a bad idea to allow pilots to take short naps , " he said			0
instead of allowing in - flight napping aboard @entity92 airlines , the @entity139 has mandated that long - haul routes include relief pilots and special onboard sleeping quarters that must be available for the flight crew			0
other sleeping incidents of course the @entity3 sleeping incident revealed thursday is n't the first of its kind			1
last february , the @entity192 airline @entity193 said it had launched an investigation after a @entity156 pilot was locked out of the cockpit and his first officer was later found asleep at the controls			1
the sleeping pilot had been left alone at the controls while his co-pilot took a bathroom break			0
the incident took place in september 2012 , when the airliner was flying from @entity206 to the @entity192 , a top @entity192 safety investigation agency said			0
the 737 landed safely in @entity208 as scheduled			0
related story : pilot locked out of cockpit while co-pilot slept @entity213 played a role in the 2009 crash of @entity216 near @entity217 , @entity218 , which killed 50 people			1
the @entity221 report on the crash cited pilot error as a factor , adding , " the pilots ' performance was likely impaired because of fatigue , but the extent of their impairment and the degree to which it contributed to the performance deficiencies that occurred during the flight can not be conclusively determined			1
" also in 2009 , @entity233 188 -- an @entity234 carrying 144 people and five crew members -- flew past the @entity237			0
one of the pilots told @entity0 that no one was sleeping on the flight deck at the time			2
the two pilots " became distracted by a conversation , " according to a report by the @entity221			2
related story : pilots say they were n't asleep when they overshot airport @entity0 's @entity27 , @entity247 and @entity248 contributed to this report .			1

@entity29 : we have no evidence that both pilots were asleep simultaneously
pilots of @entity3 airline slept in the cockpit at 30,000 feet , @entity3 aviation officials say
report : the incident was " due to longer duty period with insufficient opportunity to sleep "
some countries allow one pilot at a time to sleep in the cockpit , under certain circumstances
