-- @entity1 has picked one formidable villain for @entity4 team to battle in the sequel to last year 's mega-grossing blockbuster			1
but sentient super-bot @entity7 also presents a challenge for the film 's screenwriter too : how to make a machine that can do just about anything into an interesting on - screen character			1
@entity1 on his past , present , and future ( hint : ' @entity17 ' ) created by a scientist in the @entity20 comics , @entity7 is a self - aware robot who develops a lust for power			1
he has a laundry list of abilities â € ” super-human strength , speed , stamina , durability , flight , mind control , a coma ray and a genius intellect			0
for " @entity4 : age of @entity7 , " @entity1 reveals to @entity36 in this week 's cover story that he 's stripping back some of @entity7 's abilities and will find a way to humanize â € ” to some degree â € ” the angry bot			1
" i knew right away what i wanted to do with him , " @entity1 says			2
" he 's always trying to destroy the @entity4 , goddamn it , he 's got a bee in his bonnet			1
he 's not a happy guy , which means he 's an interesting guy			0
and the way that manifests is not going to be standard robot stuff			0
so we 'll take away some of those powers because at some point everybody becomes magic , and i already have someone [ a new character , @entity57 ] who 's a witch			0
" @entity1 adds that he has to be careful " to ground [ the character ] while still evoking that guy			2
" and like a certain giant green @entity63 hero , it sounds like large doses of rage will be key to his personality			2
" as a character i love [ @entity7 ] , " @entity1 says , " because he 's so pissed off			1
" for more , much more , from @entity69 , pick up this week 's issue of @entity36 , on stands friday , aug. 23 , which features a 10 - page q&a spread with the writer - producer - director discussing his entire career and future projects			0
