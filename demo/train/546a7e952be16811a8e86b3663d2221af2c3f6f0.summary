four top environmental scientists raised the stakes sunday in their fight to reverse climate change and save the planet			1
climate and energy scientists @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 have released an open letter calling on world leaders to support development of safer nuclear power systems			1
wait -- pro-nuclear environmentalists ? is n't that an oxymoron ? apparently , not so much anymore			2
embracing nuclear is the only way , the scientists believe , to reverse the looming threat of climate change which they blame on fossil fuels			1
depending who you ask , they 're either abandoning -- or leading -- traditional environmentalists who for a half - century have rejected clean - burning nuclear power as too expensive or too dangerous			1
opponents cite disasters at @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			0
related : @entity32 update the fear is that time is running out			0
without nuclear , the scientists believe global energy consumption will overtake the planet 's ability to reverse the buildup of carbon dioxide pollution from burning oil , coal and other fossil fuels			2
at risk , said @entity8 , are disintegrating polar ice sheets and rising sea levels which will threaten coastal regions			0
the letter is among the scientists ' strongest public statements backing nuclear power			1
it also comes as @entity1 plans to air " @entity57 , " a documentary about environmentalists and longtime nuclear opponents who 've done complete 180s on nukes			2
by releasing the letter , the scientists are " putting their reputations on the line to do something that the ultra-greens regard as treason , " said @entity64 - winning physicist @entity63			2
nuclear power is burgeoning in some parts of the world and shrinking in others			1
@entity76 is embracing it -- except @entity78 -- which is still struggling to figure out how to safely deal with the dangerously radioactive @entity32 nuclear power plant			1
the @entity78 disaster left @entity81 so unnerved that they 've chosen to phase out their 17 nuclear facilities by 2022			2
" we 've got four top guns in the environmental movement telling [ @entity81 chancellor ] @entity89 , ' you 're wrong to shut down nuclear , ' " said @entity84			2
" i think that 's a relatively big deal			0
" are we witnessing the birth of a mutiny within the environmental movement ? will typical 21st - century environmentalists eventually embrace the power of the atom ? a leading environmental group opposed to nuclear power says no. " i do n't think it 's very significant that a few people have changed their minds about nuclear power , " said @entity102 of the @entity103			1
nuclear fuel may burn cleaner , the @entity103 says , but comes with too many safety issues and too high of a price tag			2
the letter admits " today 's nuclear plants are far from perfect			0
" however , " ... there is no credible path to climate stabilization that does not include a substantial role for nuclear power			1
" read the letter the four scientists say they have no connection to " @entity57 , " which blames resistance to nuclear energy on groundless fears rooted in the @entity124 , @entity33 in 1986 and 1979 's @entity34			1
related : @entity33 's local health problems map : closest nukes to your home in the documentary , which debuts on @entity1 thursday at 9 p.m. et / @entity131 , climate change activist and author @entity133 says he knew publicly supporting nuclear energy would put his entire career at risk			1
" i 'd have been much better just to keep my mouth shut , " he admits in the film			0
" but i could n't do that			0
" @entity102 said the " movie attempts to establish the proposition that mainstream environmentalists are pouring into nuclear advocacy today			0
i 've been in the @entity103 since 1979			2
i have a pretty good idea of where the mainstream environmental groups are and have been			0
i 've seen no movement			0
" selling nuclear energy to environmentalists is a tough pitch			1
@entity8 acknowledged that many of them wo n't easily buy into it			1
parts of the community operate like " a religion of sorts , which makes it very difficult , " @entity8 said			0
" they 're not all objectively looking at the pros and cons. " the @entity103 has n't rejected nuclear power out of hand , @entity102 said			1
it constantly evaluates nuclear power and " everything else , " he said			1
" i think that 's our obligation			0
" is it possible to be both an environmentalist and a supporter of nuclear power ? " you can be , " @entity102 said			1
@entity8 has been spreading his message to the community 's top influencers			0
he tells of a recent meeting with @entity179 where he tried to sell the former vice president on how advanced nuclear technology might stabilize climate change			1
@entity179 invited two anti-nuclear advocates to the meeting , @entity8 said , and by the time it was all over , @entity179 was unmoved			2
" i mean , @entity179 essentially understands that we had better try to develop safer , better nuclear power , " said @entity8 , " but he wo n't come out and say that			1
" here 's what @entity179 did say publicly about it during a recent @entity192 " @entity192 " chat : nuclear energy " will continue to play a limited role , and if the ongoing [ research and development ] produces cheaper , safer , smaller reactors , they may yet play a more significant role			1
" @entity201 among nuclear energy supporters , @entity202 remains a hero nation			1
in the 1970s , it chose to invest heavily in nuclear power creating a system that boasts some of the cheapest energy and cleanest air on the planet			1
@entity81 puts out about 18 % of its power with nuclear			2
but with the upcoming nuke phase - out , there are doubts about whether @entity81 can offset its nuclear output with wind and other clean energy sources			1
@entity219 , vice president of the @entity220 , told @entity1 in september that the government 's energy targets are " completely unfeasible			0
" " of course , it 's possible to erect tens of thousands of windmills but only at an extreme cost and waste of natural space , " he said			0
" and still it would not be able to deliver electricity when it is needed			0
" there are 65 commercially operating nuclear plants in the @entity232 , including 104 reactors			0
five new reactors are currently being built , in @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237			0
in the past year , utilities have permanently shut down four others and plan to take a fifth out of service in 2014			0
at least two other planned projects have been shelved			0
" nuclear power is dying a slow death in the market place , which is what matters in determining its future , " said @entity102			1
as an alternative , the @entity103 is touting efficiency			2
energy - saving technology is becoming so successful , according to a new @entity103 report , that efficiency has " significant potential to dramatically reduce power plant emissions			1
" total @entity232 energy use peaked in 2007 and has been trending downward ever since , the @entity103 says			2
on the other hand , scientists in " @entity57 " claim energy consumption globally could double by 2050 -- and perhaps triple or quadruple by 2100 -- as growing nations like @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 start to want more energy			2
a @entity266 report released last month re-confirmed @entity8 's fears			0
the study concluded that the planet is heating up , the oceans are rising and there 's more evidence that neither development is natural			0
@entity8 , who was among the initial wave of scientists warning about climate change in the 1980s , said friday he fears most its " irreversible effects			1
" " once we get to a certain point and the ice sheets start to disintegrate , then you ca n't stop it			0
" and we 're getting very close to that point			0
" if we stay on the current path , he said , " those are the consequences we 'll be leaving to our children			0
the best candidate to avoid that is nuclear power			1
we need to take advantage of it			0
" @entity1 's @entity293 and @entity294 contributed to this report .			0

top enviro - scientists call on world leaders to embrace nuclear power
only nukes can make enough clean power to slow climate change , they say
nuclear energy is too expensive and risky , says @entity103
scientist : @entity179 supports safer , better nuclear power , " but he wo n't come out and say that "
