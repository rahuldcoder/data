democrats and president @entity9 support the extension -- which had been scheduled for a vote monday evening but @entity2 delayed the vote until tuesday -- while @entity12 generally oppose extending those benefits			1
and with democrats in control of the @entity17 and @entity12 having a majority in the @entity19 , the issue does n't seem to be one that will be easy to resolve			0
the check 's not in the mail roughly 1.3 million long - term unemployed were affected when @entity23 failed to continue a 2008 recession - era federal law providing nearly a year of benefits , paid for by @entity5 taxpayers , that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out			1
as @entity28 , director of the @entity19 's @entity29 told @entity1 's @entity30 on " @entity31			0
" " ( monday ) is actually the day that 1.3 million @entity5 will go to the mailbox and find that check missing , the check that they rely on to put food on their table			1
new year , old fight expect a repeat performance of years past when @entity15 and @entity12 clashed in often dramatic showdowns rife with fiery rhetoric and lengthy filibusters			1
@entity15 argue the program is needed to sustain economic recovery and offer a lifeline to those struggling to keep their head above water financially			0
@entity12 counter the benefits are an economic drain and a disincentive to looking for work			2
the @entity53 estimates continuing them for another year will cost about $ 26 billion			2
@entity12 leaders say they would consider extending the benefits but insist that the $ 26 billion comes from making cuts elsewhere			1

@entity15 are refocusing on issues relating to economic inequality , which is important to their base			0

" when you allow people to be on unemployment insurance for 99 weeks , you 're causing them to become part of this perpetual unemployed group in our economy , " @entity74 said on @entity82 last month			1
" and it really -- while it seems good , it actually does a disservice to the people you 're trying to help			0
" @entity93 : job search : one year and counting 4			0
