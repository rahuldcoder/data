-- motivation is a tricky thing			2
we need it in every aspect of our lives : to get up in the morning and go to work , to start ( and finish ) that 10 - page paper , to do laundry after a long day			1
yet the motivation to get healthy often eludes us			2
it hides in the form of excuses -- excuses for why we ca n't go to the gym or cook a healthy meal , why we ca n't get enough sleep or make time for ourselves			2
often we lack motivation because we lack inspiration			2
why i became a triathlete every year @entity0 selects @entity24 to race in a triathlon with dr. @entity26 and the @entity28 team			1
this year we 're giving six lucky readers a road bike ( with all the necessary accessories ) , a wet suit and a gym membership to help them prepare for the @entity34 on september 8			1
as they train for their first triathlon with support from our fitness and nutrition coaches , they 'll blog , tweet and share their workouts online			1
you 'll watch as they get ready to swim a half - mile in the ocean , bike 18 miles and run 4 miles along the @entity44			1
we hope this year 's @entity46 team will inspire you to make your own health a priority			1
whether it 's being a role model for your kids , accomplishing a personal goal or simply being able to enjoy life , find your motivation for getting fit and eating better			1
if our past @entity28 team members are any indication , you 'll be happy you did			1
meet this year 's team : @entity58 @entity58 was tailgating at a @entity60 game in october 2011 when he started feeling ill. on his way out of the parking lot , he passed out and fell down face first			1
at 31 years old , he had gone into sudden cardiac arrest			2
" i have a confession to make , " @entity58 wrote in his first blog for @entity28			2
" i was petrified of not being selected to the @entity67			1
" it seemed as though everyone who applied to the challenge was going to ' start this new way of life , ' regardless of being selected or not			1
@entity79 , on the other hand , was shaking in my boots			2
i was not ready to face the reality of trying to live a healthier lifestyle by myself , again			2
" a fourth - grade teacher from @entity84 , @entity58 is now ready to follow his own advice to his students : you have to work really , really hard to reach success			1
" i 'm in this for the long term , and failure is not an option			2
i 'll do whatever my @entity67 coaches and mentors ask me to do			2
i 'll follow their workouts , their eating plans and everything in between			1
will it be easy ? no , probably not			2
but ' they ' usually say that nothing worthwhile ever is			2
" hear more of @entity58 's story will @entity102 will @entity102 grew up in the military , traveling from country to country with his family			1
as an adult , the @entity84 man became a soldier himself			2
looking back on his childhood has motivated the 28 - year - old single father to become a role model for his son			2
that includes quitting smoking , a bad habit he picked up after leaving the @entity118			2
" i want to stay living as long as possible in order to experience this world in its entirety , " @entity102 wrote			2
" i want to be around when my son has a chance to see the world , and i want to be there to guide him and teach him right from wrong			0
... if it makes any sense , i would say just by seeing what i have seen thus far , i know there is much more to see			0
" i know this training and competing will be painful and mentally stressful , but if he sees that his father was able to finish something he set out for , maybe he will think he can do the same thing and strive to be the best			1
" hear more of @entity102 's story @entity137 @entity137 wanted to join the basketball team when she was 10 years old			1
permission slip in hand , she excitedly told her parents about her plans -- but , she says , they told her she was too fat to play			0
" those five words impacted my life more than i could ever know , " @entity137 wrote on her @entity144 submission			0
" for the past 20 - plus years i 've been ' too fat to ' do a lot of things			0
" the tipping point came when @entity137 's twin sister needed a kidney transplant			1
doctors would n't even test @entity137 to see if she was a match because she was obese			0
since then , @entity137 has lost more than 100 pounds			0
" i 've seen how my body has changed and how strong i 'm getting and it amazes me , " the @entity155 resident wrote			0
" my way of thinking and seeing myself are still works in progress			0
many days i feel like the 10 - year - old that just wanted to play basketball , and i still hear ' you 're too fat to play			0
' " i need to be able to run across the finish line and be able to call myself a triathlete			1
completing this challenge with the 2013 @entity28 team will do more for me mentally and emotionally than any amount of weight i can ever lose			1
" hear more of @entity137 's story @entity169 " i barely recognize the person i 've become , " @entity169 wrote in his first blog			1
" who is this fat guy staring back at me in the mirror ? apparently watching sports on tv does n't actually count as exercise			0
who knew ? ! " @entity180 is a big fan of triathlons			0
he has volunteered at several in his hometown of @entity185			0
watching from the sidelines , he wished he could be one of the athletes crossing the finish line			1
" but how could such an unhealthy person become a triathlete ? " he asked himself			0
" the journey seemed so overwhelming , but every one of those athletes , from the pros to the @entity194 , had to start somewhere , right ? " thanks to encouragement from his girlfriend , @entity180 will soon get to cross the finish line in @entity200			1
" i know that success and real change will come from hard work , but i 'm committed to the miles of training that lie ahead , " he wrote			0
" i 'm ready to finally improve -- and downsize -- the person i see in the mirror			0
" hear more of @entity169 's story @entity210 life has n't been easy for @entity210			1
at just 19 years old , the @entity213 resident was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis , a type of inflammatory bowel disease			0
symptoms forced her to quit school , and she spent several years in and out of hospitals			0
" blood transfusions , broken bones , mono , pneumonia , incontinence , painful joints , significant weight loss followed by significant weight gain , major abdominal surgeries and a temporary ileostomy left me physically weary and nearly defeated , " @entity220 wrote on her @entity144 submission			0
" nearly defeated " is the key phase			0
after having her colon removed in emergency surgery , @entity220 slowly recovered -- marrying her college sweetheart , earning her degree , starting work in the nonprofit world and adopting a baby			0
now she has her eyes set on new goals			0
" first and foremost , i want to get fit			1
i want to lose these extra pounds and be healthy and active every day			0
i want to live a long life for my husband and 7 - year - old daughter			0
" i also want to reduce stigma around @entity249 and other digestive disease ( s )			0
as you might imagine , this is not the stuff of cocktail party chatter			0
however , 1.4 million @entity256 suffer silently from inflammatory bowel disease			0
" i have spent many years convincing myself that to be active i can only work out in a gym or at home -- somewhere near a bathroom			0
it 's time to face these fears head on			1
it 's time to get out of the gym and on the road			1
" hear more of @entity220 's story @entity268 @entity268 , a long - time prison warden for the @entity269 , will retire two weeks after the @entity34			1
she 's excited about her retirement , but wants to be in shape so she can enjoy quality time with her husband , three kids and seven grandkids			1
" i have ... learned the past few years how truly precious life is , and that none of us can take our health for granted , " @entity268 , of @entity276 , @entity277 , wrote in her blog			0
" i have lost my sister , my brother , both of my parents			0
i am the oldest of the four kids that my parents had -- our younger brother died of leukemia when we were kids -- and the only one that survived them			0
sadly , the primary causes of death for my brother and sister were preventable			0
" @entity268 has read scary statistics about her profession : people who work in corrections have the second highest mortality rate of any job ; on average , a corrections officer 's 58th birthday will be their last			1
that motivated her to apply for the @entity67 team			1
" i am a literal bundle of emotions , " @entity268 wrote in the days leading up to the kick - off weekend trip			0
" i am excited beyond belief , humbled to have been selected from so many applicants , scared to death about being able to keep up with the youngsters on the team , and terrified of having to wear the tri shorts that came in the mail today in public			1
" most of all , i can not wait to get started on this journey			2
