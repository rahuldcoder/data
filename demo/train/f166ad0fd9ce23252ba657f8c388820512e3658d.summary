-- all three presidential debates are now in the books and the race to the @entity4 is taking its final shape			1
looking back , the first debate was undoubtedly the watershed moment of this campaign and the most powerful inflection point in the race to date			0
president @entity11 regained some lost ground in the next two debates , including monday night 's event , but the damage had already been done			1
@entity16 now carries the momentum into the home stretch			1
like in the second debate , @entity11 came out monday night more aggressive and more provocative			1
he threw more punches and landed more punches , centering his attacks on trying to characterize @entity16 's foreign policy as amateur and reckless			2
but there was an air of desperation in his delivery			0
it was as if he knew he needed to not just defeat @entity16 , but to destroy him			2
he fell far short of that bar			0
opinion : @entity11 in command ; @entity16 plays it safe @entity11 was helped , however , by @entity16 's peculiar pass on contesting @entity36 and the @entity38 catastrophe while also not taking @entity11 to task for the timetable and withdrawal from @entity42			1
@entity16 's repeated agreement with @entity11 on issues like drone strikes and keeping @entity47 forces out of @entity48 and @entity49 in any way may upset some conservatives			1
but we are at a different time and place in the foreign policy psyche of most @entity47			0
the country is war - weary , wants the troops to come home and does n't want any form of intervention in another country			0
@entity16 had to reassure voters that he was not interested in nation - building and provoking or initiating foreign conflicts			2
he accomplished that very well			0
it was a different test for a different time for a @entity70 candidate			0
he distanced himself from president @entity71 and offered his own vision for the @entity73			0
or as he put it , the @entity47 should " help the - the world of @entity75 and other parts of the world , reject this radical violent extremism			0
" perhaps foreshadowing the last two weeks of the presidential race , @entity16 used the debate to move to the center			1
he emphasized peace and diplomacy and avoided at all costs any hint of sending @entity47 forces to future wars			0
@entity16 also looked and acted presidential			1
he had a steady , levelheaded confidence and avoided any snarky , patronizing " horses and bayonets " moments			0
@entity11 used the final debate to go to the left and energize his base , attacking @entity16 at any opportunity while throwing in comments about teachers and classroom size -- a clear signal to his strong base with the teacher 's union			1
@entity11 offered little on his plans for a second term and spent much of the debate hammering @entity16			1
opinion : was @entity11 too relentless with @entity16 ? that may be why some commentators think @entity16 acted and appeared more like the president and @entity11 the challenger			1
one of the central facets of the @entity11 campaign was to define @entity16 as an unacceptable candidate , which they did relentlessly in states like @entity118			1
yet , @entity16 's first debate performance shattered that image			1
and through the rest of the debates , he proved that he is not the man they said he was ; he is not a warmonger or greedy vulture capitalist			0
now , @entity11 is racing to put the genie back in the bottle			2
the electoral map is shrinking for him while expanding for @entity16			1
@entity130 recently admitted the @entity11 campaign has given up on @entity131			2
meanwhile , @entity70 vice presidential candidate @entity133 recently campaigned in @entity134 , a state once thought to be totally out of the reach of @entity16 and @entity133			2
according to @entity138 's electoral map , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity134 are now toss - up states and @entity131 is leaning @entity16			1
with the wind at this back , @entity16 can now consolidate his resources in the most crucial states -- @entity118 , @entity145 , @entity146 and perhaps even @entity139 and @entity134			2
and with the foreign policy debate in the rear view mirror , he can get back to the economy -- his strongest issue and advantage over the president			2
opinion : so , who 's going to win ? in the latest @entity162 / @entity161 poll @entity16 has a six point advantage on which candidate is better at dealing with the economy , a seven point lead on jobs and unemployment and a whopping 13 point lead on fixing the deficit			0
barring any october surprise , he will likely keep the momentum			0
with less than two weeks to go , it may matter less what @entity16 and @entity11 say but where they say it			1
that will tell us all we need to know about how the campaigns feel heading into the home stretch			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			0

@entity179 : president @entity11 was aggressive in final debate , but it may be too late
@entity179 : some *pundits* think @entity16 acted more presidential than @entity11
he says the electoral map is shrinking for @entity11 while expanding for @entity16
@entity179 : barring any surprises , @entity16 will likely keep the momentum
