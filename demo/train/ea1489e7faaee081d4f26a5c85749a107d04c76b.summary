-- every day , the federal government 's partial shutdown brings more tragic and disheartening news to @entity5 's veterans , troops and their families			1
this week , the @entity8 announced it would be unable to pay the $ 100,000 death gratuity benefit to support families of the fallen -- news that is insulting to those who serve and their families			1
for a government that readily claims to support @entity5 's troops and veterans by spending billions on service members and veterans , legislators failed to notice that this particular lack of funding , a mere fraction of the @entity8 's budget , would be cut off , causing needless pain to grieving families			1
the news drew quick condemnation from pundits , the military and veterans community , and members of @entity29			1
politicians from both parties , displaying a sense of urgency yet to be seen on the notion of ending the shutdown , rushed to condemn the decision and quickly called for the benefits to be reinstated			2
fortunately , the military charity @entity38 has stepped up and will cover these benefits for the @entity8 until the problem is solved			0
the strong words and overwhelming bipartisan support on death benefits and veterans funding issues makes veterans wonder why @entity29 can muster such sharp and decisive action on a limited basis , especially when it involves veterans and the military community ? veterans and military families are left to wonder if the pledges of support are genuine , or do they just conveniently provide a symbolic fallback issue for legislators when governing in @entity57 gets tough ? as part of shutdown politics , members continually retreat to the veterans community , to the point that they start tripping over each other to be first in front of the camera			1
this behavior was on display last week as well when members of @entity29 attempted to gain the upper hand in the public relations battle over the closure of the @entity71			1
for " the greatest generation , " the @entity71 is more than pillars and a fountain ; it is a shrine to the more than 400,000 @entity75 who gave their lives in lands far away from the @entity75 for ideals that we still fight for every day in this country			0
it is a solemn place of remembrance for men and women who endured hardship , tragedy and suffering on levels that many of us simply can not fathom			0
once the government shutdown began , the site was supposed to be off - limits to everyone , including @entity95 veterans			1
but on the day the government shut down , 92 @entity95 veterans visiting from @entity97 made headlines by breaking through the barricades and paying homage to their fallen comrades			1
suddenly , a war that ended more than 65 years ago became current a few hours into a government shutdown			1
the image of @entity95 veterans breaking through yellow tape and metal barricades went viral , and members of @entity29 from both parties quickly attached themselves to the fight			1
this shutdown has generated a style of bandwagon politics in the last week that is getting stale			0
rather than focus on solving the problems that resulted in the shutdown , politicians are conveniently highlighting veterans and military families without doing the one job that will really help : ending the shutdown			1
the threat for veterans and military families is all too real			2
a denial of some services and lingering doubt about the future will only add more financial and emotional anguish to a community that 's already endured war for more than a dozen years			0
on social media via # @entity131 and calls to @entity132 and @entity5 case managers , we hear from veterans in the @entity137 backlog who will have to spend more time waiting for a claims decision than they spent in combat zones			0
veterans who make up 27 % of the federal workforce are now furloughed			0
@entity143 drills are being rescheduled or canceled in many states , affecting troop readiness and pay			0
on base , services that military families count on are now closed			0
veterans who rely on disability and @entity153 benefits are facing the very real possibility of not getting their benefits next month , as @entity137 secretary @entity156 testified wednesday			0
photo - ops , shouting matches and gimmicks will not help veterans and military families who are hurting during the shutdown			2
these political events provide no long - term benefits for the military community and get us nowhere closer to ending a shutdown that is inflicting real pain on the men and women who fought for our country			2
the political games and posturing need to end			2
make no mistake that veterans and military families appreciate compliments and expressions of support and gratitude -- but what we need most right now are solutions			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			0

@entity184 : death benefits were cut off to families of the fallen
he says a temporary fix does *n't* fully undo impact of the partial government shutdown
members of @entity29 rush to denounce cuts in veterans ' services to score pr points
@entity200 : what we need is action to end shutdown , not political posturing
