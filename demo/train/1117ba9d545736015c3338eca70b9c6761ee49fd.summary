-- @entity1 is a day set aside to remember the @entity3 troops who have died			2
one way to honor the fallen troops is to volunteer at a veterans cemetery			1
and while there are opportunities on @entity1 , there are other ways you can help all year long			1
there are more than 150 national cemeteries and monument sites maintained by such groups as the the @entity16 and the @entity17			0
read more about them or find a volunteer opportunity at a cemetery near you			2
the @entity16 has these tips on ways you can help at a veterans cemetery that you might not have considered : -- volunteer to greet visitors , give tours or research and document cemetery history -- donate items such as golf carts , which are used to transport visitors who need assistance reaching a gravesite -- volunteer to raise and lower cemetery flags on national holidays -- help maintain the final resting place of fallen troops by volunteering to prune trees , mend cemetery flags , repair cemetery benches or sponsor a burial area or flower bed and maintain it all year long -- if you 're a bugler , volunteer to play a live " taps " at veterans ' funerals			1
about 1,800 veterans die each day , most of them from @entity51 , according to the @entity16			0
because the military can not provide enough buglers to play at such a large number of funerals , @entity52 passed a law in 2000 to allow a recorded version to be played			0
but many families of the fallen prefer a live version if possible .			0

volunteering time at a nearby veterans cemetery can be a way to honor the fallen at @entity1
there are also volunteer opportunities all year long
maintaining the grounds , helping repair or even greeting visitors are some ways to help
