-- the @entity1 made clear sunday it will not budge on its opposition to any new gun laws , despite heated criticism of the organization 's response to the @entity8 school massacre			1
" i know this town wants to argue about gun control , " the group 's ceo , @entity9 , told @entity14 's " @entity13 " in @entity15			1
" i do n't think it will work			0
" @entity9 stood by remarks he made at an event friday billed as a news conference -- though he took no questions -- in which he argued for armed guards in schools			1
" if it 's crazy to call for putting police and armed security in our schools to protect our children , then call me crazy , " he said on sunday			1
he added that in friday 's news conference , " i said what i honestly thought and what millions , and hundreds of millions , of people all over this country believe will actually make a difference			2
" " we 're going to support an immediate appropriation before @entity36 to put police officers in every school , " he vowed			0
legislation being pushed by sen. @entity40 , @entity41 , to restore an assault weapons ban is not going to make kids any safer , @entity9 insisted			2

" there are so many different ways " that a " monster " could carry out a massacre , as @entity53 did in @entity54 , @entity8 , @entity9 argued			1
he would not express support for any new gun restrictions , saying most gun laws on the books are currently rarely enforced			0
" i know there 's a media machine in this country that wants to blame guns every time something happens , " he said , adding , " i know there 's an @entity68 industry in this town			2
" the @entity1 supports efforts to improve mental health care in the country in hopes of avoiding such nightmare scenarios , @entity9 said			1
meanwhile , @entity75 , the man charged with developing the @entity1 's program to place armed guards in schools , told @entity0 his " high - level panel of experts " will present educators with safety options and detailed instructions			1
sen. @entity84 , an independent from @entity8 , told @entity0 , " i have found the statements by the @entity1 over the last couple of days to be really disheartening , because the statements seem to not reflect any understanding about the slaughter of children that happened in @entity54			1
... " the @entity1 spokespeople have been willing to deal with every possible cause of gun violence , except guns			1
they 're right that there 's a problem for our society -- how do you spot a child or a person who is troubled before they become a killer ? what 's the influence of violence in our entertainment culture on people ? but it 's obviously also true that the easy availability of guns , including military - style assault weapons , is a contributing factor , and you ca n't keep that off the table			2
i had hoped they 'd come to the table and say , everything is on the table			0
" @entity53 shot his way into @entity123 in @entity54 and killed 20 children -- none of them older than 7 -- and six adults			0
he used a @entity128 rifle to mow down his victims before killing himself with one of the two handguns he was carrying			0
on friday , a week after the shooting , @entity9 spoke out for the first time on the massacre , blaming video games and the media , while also proposing an armed guard in every @entity139 school			1
" the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun , " he said			0
some gun owners and mostly @entity147 officials rallied around @entity9 , and some -- such as @entity150 gov. @entity149 -- have indicated they support putting armed guards , or even teachers with concealed weapons , in schools			1

" right now , our schools remain unprotected , " he said			0
our children deserve to be protected			0
" but most of the reaction to @entity9 was negative			2
@entity170 sen. - elect and @entity139 rep. @entity171 , whose district includes @entity54 , called @entity9 's words " the most revolting , tone - deaf statement i 've ever seen			1
" @entity176 mayor @entity175 , an independent , blasted them as " a shameful evasion of the crisis facing the country			0
" and former @entity182 chairman @entity181 said he found the remarks " very haunting and very disturbing			0
" this wave of criticism continued into the weekend			0
would your gun fall under the ' 94 weapons ban ? @entity176 's tabloids , normally political polar opposites , offered the same take : the @entity192 ' headline called @entity9 the " @entity196 on @entity197 , " while @entity194 's @entity193 ran with , " @entity195 ! @entity1 loon in bizarre rant over @entity54			1
" @entity200 , another @entity0 ireporter and a retired police officer , cut up his @entity1 membership card in the wake of the mass shooting , which he said changed his views on gun control			1
" there 's got to be a limit to what they let citizens have at their disposal , " the @entity209 resident said			0
both sides , at least , appear to agree something needs to be done to prevent more mass shootings like what happened december 14 in the once quiet @entity8 town			2
president @entity221 used his speech at a prayer service for the massacre 's victims to call for action and subsequently tapped vice president @entity227 to lead a group charged with coming up with solutions			2
polls suggest that , after @entity54 , the @entity139 public is increasingly open to measures such as a ban on assault weapons , which was in effect in the 1990s until it lapsed in 2004			0
a @entity0 / @entity237 poll conducted after the shooting shows that a slight majority of @entity139 favor restrictions on guns			1
conservative democrats and some @entity147 who have supported gun rights have said they are open to discussing gun control			1
in a speech last sunday night , @entity221 insisted inaction was not an option , especially when it comes to protecting children			0
" we ca n't tolerate this anymore , " the president said , alluding not only to @entity54 but three other mass shootings over the past two years			0
" these tragedies must end			0
and to end them , we must change			0
" opinion : do n't let this moment pass without acting on gun control			2
