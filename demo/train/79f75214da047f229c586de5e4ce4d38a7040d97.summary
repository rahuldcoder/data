-- @entity1 played @entity2 on " @entity3 " from 1990 to 1998			1
having long since hung up his @entity5 uniform and @entity8 cabana boy polo shirt , his character became a journalist and departed to take a job at the @entity11 of the @entity12 , and @entity1 left the show four episodes into the series ' ninth season			1
" i felt that the character of @entity2 had kind of run his course			0
i had explored everything i wanted to explore with him , " @entity1 told @entity0 while promoting his new book , " @entity1 : a memoir " ( @entity23 ) at the @entity24 of @entity0			1
" in retrospect , i do regret leaving			0
understanding what i do now about story and character , i believe that [ @entity30 ] was pushing the story in a direction that would have had @entity2 and @entity33 end up together at the end of the show and i think i probably should have stuck around to its fruition			1
" fans of " 90210 " surely remember @entity40 's ( @entity41 ) " i choose me " speech following @entity2 and @entity44 's ( @entity43 ) showdown for her affections			2
@entity2 wanted @entity33 to marry him			0
@entity44 wanted to take her on a trip around the world			0
but @entity1 believes executive producer @entity30 had always envisioned @entity2 and @entity33 riding off into the sunset			1
" i think my departure also hurt @entity30 's feelings , " continued @entity1			1
" @entity30 and i had worked very closely together for a number of years			1
he gave me a lot of opportunities , and i feel like my departure hurt his feelings and i never meant to do that			2
" among the opportunities @entity30 afforded the @entity57 - born @entity1 was the opportunity to direct several " 90210 " episodes -- 15 in total			1
in fact , @entity1 directed two of the series ' most iconic : the one where @entity44 's wife , @entity65 ( @entity66 ) was killed in a mob hit mix - up in which @entity44 was the target ; and the episode where @entity72 ( @entity73 ) lost her virginity			1
" everyone remembers the candles , " @entity75 , 44 , said of the episode in which @entity72 had sex for the first time			1
" but i could only have , like , six candles because they did n't want to pay for a fire marshal , which would have cost $ 350			0
so six candles it was			0
" so i had that one candelabra , " recalled @entity1 , " and i kept moving it around for every shot and through the magic of @entity90 it looked like a lot of candles ! " as the director , as well as @entity30 's friend , @entity1 was under the added stress of directing a scene in which the tv legend 's daughter loses her virginity -- albeit her alter ego			1
" i was in a difficult spot , " he said			0
" i wanted to be respectful , but it had to be sexy			0
i was kind of walking on eggshells that day			0
" @entity1 also contributed to the dialogue of the show			1
true " 90210 " devotees should recall that @entity2 had quite a few catchphrases , and @entity1 was kind enough to reflect on such @entity107 as : " stop the bombing ! " " seldom right and wrong again			1
" " right church , wrong pew			0
" " dim sum and den some			0
" " it 's funny that you bring all those sayings up , " said @entity1			2
" part of the fun of working on ' @entity3 , 90210 , ' for me , was that i got a lot of freedom from our executive producer , @entity120 , to add things , change things			1
i got a lot of freedom to be creative			0
my theater training was all improv , that 's sort of the world i came from , so the @entity2 - isms you speak of , a lot of them came from me ! i 've been saying , ' stop the bombing ! ' for a long time			2
" another reason @entity1 regrets leaving " 90210 " is because the series needed @entity2 's @entity136 ways to offset the onscreen chaos			1
" i think there was no more moral center to the show , " @entity1 said of @entity2 's departure			1
" there was no more lynchpin			0
there were no more @entity145 in the @entity146			1
it kind of did n't make sense anymore			0
so , i regret leaving the show for all those reasons			0
" though it premiered nearly a quarter - century ago , " 90210 " continues to resonate with audiences			2
" it 's certainly not the fashions , " said @entity1			2
" i think there were a lot of universal life lessons and truths in that show , and i think that 's maybe why it 's stood the test of time			0
" the book goes into all manner of " 90210 " tell - all , such as @entity167 's shenanigans and what led to her firing			1
@entity171 's bon voyage had nothing do do with @entity167 's hard - partying ways and nightclub fights			0
@entity30 actually thought that any publicity was good publicity			2
rather , it was her chronic tardiness that held up production , costing @entity180 a ton of money			0
@entity30 gave @entity167 many chances , but in the end , it was a business decision			2
@entity1 also writes about who he keeps in touch with ( pretty much everybody , but he and @entity43 are particularly close ) , his five - year romance with actress @entity190 ( who played the unstable but later redeemed , esteemed @entity192 scholar @entity191 ) , and his not so warm and fuzzy feelings about @entity73 's husband , fellow @entity195 @entity194			1
@entity1 is at peace with being forever associated with @entity2			2
" i 'm ok with it , " he told @entity0			1
" it 's baggage i carry with me			0
but i find as my career goes on , and i have more and more successes in other arenas and with other characters , i find that @entity2 becomes less and less part of my life			0
i find that a lot of people associate me with ' @entity207 ' these days			0
" " @entity207 " is an award - winning @entity209 half - hour comedy -- available to @entity211 on @entity212 -- in which @entity1 plays an immoral , sinatra - idolizing used car salesman			1
" @entity1 : a memoir " also recalls the prefame days of having @entity214 for a roommate , @entity1 's later battles with alcohol ( he once spent five days in jail on a @entity219 ) , and the 2002 race car crash that nearly cost him his life			1
additionally on the professional horizon , @entity1 's feature directorial debut , " @entity228 , " a road trip comedy starring @entity224 , will hit theaters later this year			2
@entity1 is married to makeup artist @entity229			2
the couple has a young daughter and a young son			0
" my kids are my greatest achievement , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" i love being a husband and a father			0
that aspect of my life has been a joy			0

@entity1 told @entity0 he let @entity30 down when he left " @entity3 , 90210 "
he also regrets his departure because " there were no more @entity145 in the @entity146 "
he directed the candle - *lit* episode where @entity72 loses her virginity
his new book also talks rooming with @entity214 , a near - fatal car crash and fatherhood
