-- what will the internet of the future look like ? and what purpose will it be used for ? from augmented reality , which anticipates the information you 'll want just by looking at an object , to smart services that use artificial intelligence to help us manage our workloads , the look , feel and utility of the internet of 2040 is a wide open field			1
already advances in virtual reality technology - @entity18 notably bought the virtual reality start - up @entity21 for $ 2bn this year - are beginning to change the way we deal with everything from medical science , to military training , to learning difficulties			1
to what extent , however , we 'll have control over our own data is one of the future 's great unanswered questions			1
for many the future of the internet is already here ; and it looks a lot like it did in 1990s			1
called the @entity41 , this anonymised section of the net allows everyone from copyright pirates , to drug dealers , to dissidents to communicate and do business without fear of leaving their digital fingerprints			1
special browser @entity50 , whose book " @entity52 " investigates the digital underworld , told @entity0 that this opaque and subversive world is inaccessible through normal browsers , and requires special software			1
" a special browser called @entity58 allows a user to browse the internet without their ip address being given away , " @entity50 said			1
" it uses a clever encryption system that means no one can see what computer a user is on			0
" this same encryption system also affords anonymity to the websites that inhabit this corner of the web , meaning that governments and law enforcers have no idea where the site is being hosted			0
that does n't mean that the individuals running these operations can forever remain hidden , as the capture of the creator of " @entity81 " , a famous illegal online marketplace , by the @entity83 in 2013 demonstrates			0
still , the tools to make life difficult for law enforcement seem to be there : " anyone can set up these websites which are almost impossible to shut down and censor , " he said			0
" as a result it 's a bit of a @entity94 -- more or less anything goes			1
" you 've got illegal pornography there , these drugs markets there , assassination markets and hit men for hire			2
all sorts of terrible stuff but also all sorts of good stuff too			0
" @entity108 revolutionaries , whistle blowers , human rights activists who are also concerned about giving away their location also want somewhere where they can post stuff illegally and anonymously			1
" @entity114 military @entity50 said the browser was initially developed by the @entity114 military as a way of traversing the internet secretly , but since then had become an open source project			2
he suggests the military released the encrypted browser as a way of providing cover for their operations			0
because the tor browser uses a non-standard protocol , people observing network traffic can identify it easily even if they ca n't see what the user is looking at			0
" they realised that this is not a good idea if the only people using it are the @entity114 military -- it 's going to be obvious who they are			2
for that reason , they turned it into an open source project			0
" today , the @entity41 is moving from fringe to mainstream , attracting anyone who wants anonymity -- be they hired killers or humble bloggers			1
back to the future for @entity50 , the @entity41 is a return to the labrynthine recesses of the first days of the worldwide web			1
he said the future of the net is likely to be an increased proliferation of these non-standard protocols that provide ever deeper levels of anonymity			2
" it really feels like the early days of the internet ... ( everything ) is hosted on these rudimentary networks			2
it 's like the internet of the early 90s when things were n't indexed the way they are now			1
" everything is hyperlinked together and @entity164 can find everything , but back in the day the whole internet was dark -- you did n't know what you were doing or where you were going			2
" you even used to write down web addresses on pieces of paper and pass them to each other			0
" art project just what can be found on the @entity41 is often the subject of wild conjecture , but a recent project launched by the ! @entity179 art collective -- called " @entity41 -- from @entity185 to @entity184 " - shows exactly what is on offer on the @entity183 's underbelly			1
arming an automated internet bot with us $ 100 in bitcoins ( the crypto - currency accepted as legal tender on many illicit marketplaces ) the " @entity193 " trawls its murky corners and every week buys one item at random			1
so far , the bot has purchased a " stash can " of @entity196 that doubles as a hiding place for either drugs or money , a platinum @entity200 for $ 35 , 10 @entity202 from @entity203 for us $ 48 , 10 packets of @entity206 cigarettes from @entity207 , and many other items such as jeans , " designer " bags , and books			1
one of the most intriguing pieces for the exhibitors at the @entity216 gallery in @entity216 , @entity217 -- where all the parcels arrive -- has been a fireman 's set of skeleton keys from the @entity222			2
" our first question was what do you do with this ? what does it open ? " @entity230 , co-founder of the art collective , told @entity0			2
on the @entity41 , the keys are advertised as useful for unlocking toolboxes or " gaining access to communal gates and storage areas			1
" ' thrilling and scary ' she said receiving the parcels at the gallery was at once " thrilling and scary			0
" " the motivation for the artwork really came in the light of the @entity244 revelations - for internet artists it meant we had to re-evaluate the networks we work in			0
we became really interested in looking at these anonymous and encrypted networks from an artistic point of view			0
" she said the starting point for them had been how to build trust in an anonymous network			0
the project has already dented the levels of trust at the art collective who early on in the project called in the services of a lawyer to shore up their legal position should the bot turn up anything that puts them outside the law			1
fortunately , @entity230 said , firearm sales are limited to clients within the @entity114			0
" that 's why we got the idea of going into marketplaces because trust is something you need to build in markets			0
" the artists have already gained notoriety by sending a parcel to fugitive whistleblower @entity281			0
the parcel was equipped with a cam that recorded its journey through the postal service to the @entity286 where @entity281 is currently holed up			0
