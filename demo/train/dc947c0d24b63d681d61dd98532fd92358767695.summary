-- @entity1 , one of two @entity4 farms at the center of this past summer 's salmonella outbreak and massive egg recall , won federal approval tuesday to sell to consumers eggs produced at two henhouses			1
" during the outbreak , i said that @entity13 would not agree to the sale of eggs to consumers from @entity1 until we had confidence that they could be shipped and consumed safely , " said @entity13 commissioner @entity12 in a statement			1
" after four months of intensive work by the company and oversight , testing , and inspections by @entity13 , i am satisfied that time has come			1

@entity1 , of @entity32 , @entity4 , had not shipped eggs to consumers from the two hen houses since august			1
in the summer , the @entity13 found what it termed " deplorable " conditions at @entity1 after the company conducted a nationwide voluntary recall of shell eggs that it had shipped since may 19 , 2010			1
@entity43 eggs from @entity1 were sold to distributors and wholesalers in 22 states and @entity47 , who then distributed the shell eggs further			2
according to the @entity13 statement , @entity1 took the following corrective steps at the barns on one of its six farms : -- the laying hens present in these houses at the time of the outbreak have been removed and the houses cleaned , sanitized and tested to ensure that they are no longer contaminated with salmonella enteritidis			1

after the recall , fresh eggs at facilities believed to be contaminated were sold to " breaking plants " that break the eggshells , pasteurize the eggs and turn them into liquid or other form used in a variety of products , officials said			0
that step was meant to kill any pathogens			0
the two barns resuming shell egg production will produce about 72,000 dozen eggs per week , or about 3.7 million dozen eggs each year , according to @entity1			2
about 800,000 eggs per week are still going to " breaking plants			0
