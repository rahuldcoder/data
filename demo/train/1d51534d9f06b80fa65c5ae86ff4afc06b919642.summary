i 'm sitting in a tiny , open - air seafood restaurant in @entity4 fishing village in @entity5 , @entity6 , waiting for my breakfast			1
in the distance , on the rocky shore , a local haenyeo ( " sea woman " ) is picking through her morning 's catch			0
" she 's late , " says a fellow patron when she notices me staring			0
" all the other haenyeo have already finished their diving and delivered their catch			0
" like their more famous @entity22 counterparts , @entity5 's haenyeo are " mermaids " who support their families by diving for seafood without the use of any particular tools or artificial breathing aids			1
the subject of many documentaries , they 're a dying breed -- an estimated 20,000 haenyeo still work in @entity6 -- due to the intense physical difficulties of the job			0
while most haenyeo usually dive about five meters and stay underwater for 30 - second intervals , many are capable of diving as deep as 20 meters and staying underwater for as long as two minutes			2
@entity22 : @entity46 's new best weekend getaway ? @entity48 dining @entity49 itself is a tranquil contrast from the crowds and bustle in other parts of @entity5			0
the little string of shops selling hoe ( @entity59 sashimi ) in " @entity60 " provide a classic example of the matriarchal family businesses headed by @entity5 's haenyeo			0
women dive in the morning , then pass their catch to other female members of the family , who run one - person operations selling the day 's seafood in shacks by the shore			2
while the shacks may seem crude from the outside , dining areas in the back are clean and have beautiful views of the sea			0
seagulls fly about and quirky lighthouses in the background -- a trademark of the region -- provide excellent photo ops			1
thick green porridge a specialty of the area is abalone porridge , known as jeonbokjuk			1
" @entity93 is the best breakfast food because it 's so smooth and easy on the stomach , " says @entity90 , 56 , owner of one of the small seaside restaurants			1
she ladles thick spoonfuls of the freshly made , steaming porridge , making sure to show me the beautiful mother of pearl she removed from the abalone i picked from a tank 15 minutes ago			1
her sister - in - law dove for abalone that morning , she tells me , and has been doing so for the past 12 years			2
while the setting is humble and the table plain , the price is n't cheap			0
a bowl of porridge costs ₩ 10,000 ( $ 9 )			2
sides of raw conch and live octopus ( also ₩ 10,000 each ) come squirming on my plate			1
the porridge is thicker and greener and more delicious than any i 've had in @entity117			1
the live octopus is incredibly fresh			1
the sesame oil - dipped tentacles tingle in my mouth as they writhe for the last time			0
beyond @entity117 : 19 reasons to explore @entity6 while breakfast is a quiet affair , it gets crowded at lunch , says @entity90			1
that 's when businessmen from nearby towns flock to the village for lunch , along with the local ajumma ( older @entity59 women ) who gather here to dish the latest gossip			1
do foreign visitors ever come ? i ask			0
" we get occasional international tourists who come just to see the village , but they ca n't really stomach the seafood , " says @entity90			2
" the porridge , maybe			0
