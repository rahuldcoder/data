-- the recent release of @entity3 sgt. @entity2 by the @entity4 in @entity5 has refocused attention on some of the other @entity7 held captive in that region			1
@entity2 spent five years in the hands of the @entity4 before the @entity7 government reached an agreement for a prisoner swap with his captors stirring debate in the @entity7 about the terms of the deal and circumstances surrounding his capture			1
although @entity2 was the only @entity7 soldier in captivity , other @entity7 citizens are being held in the region			1
the longest detention is that of former @entity25 agent @entity24 , who went missing after traveling to an @entity27 island more than seven years ago			1
his family says he was working for the @entity29 at the time			2
@entity30 congressman @entity30 wrote to president @entity31 this week to ask why three other @entity7 he said were being held by @entity4 - linked militants were not part of the deal that freed @entity2			1
here are several of the most high - profile cases : @entity24 in march , @entity36 , 66 , passed a grim milestone , becoming the longest held hostage @entity7 in history			1
he vanished after traveling to the @entity27 island of @entity41 in march 2007			1
the @entity25 says he was there as a private investigator			0
but news reports late last year said he was working as an independent @entity29 contractor when he disappeared			2
that prompted his family to speak out , saying they kept it quiet for years that @entity36 was working for the @entity29 , because the @entity7 government had warned them that revealing it would put him in more jeopardy			1
the @entity25 , @entity53 and @entity29 have not publicly acknowledged any connection between the @entity29 and @entity36			0
it 's unclear who exactly is holding him or what his condition is			0
the family received a video in 2010 in which @entity36 said he had been treated well but needed the help of the @entity7 government " to answer the requests of the group that has held me for three - and - a - half years			1
" @entity7 officials have said they believe @entity36 , who has diabetes and high blood pressure , is being held somewhere in southwest @entity70			1
in march , secretary of state @entity71 said the @entity7 government " remains committed to the safe return of mr. @entity24 to his family			1
" he asked the @entity27 government to " work cooperatively with us " on the investigation , @entity71 said			1
but @entity27 has repeatedly said it is n't holding @entity36 and does n't know his whereabouts			1
during an interview in september with @entity0 's @entity79 , @entity27 president @entity77 was asked what he could tell @entity36 's family			1
" we do n't know where he is , who he is , " @entity77 said			0
" he is an @entity7 who has disappeared			1
we have no news of him			0
" in january , @entity27 foreign minister @entity88 tolds @entity0 's @entity89 that he had n't seen " anything that could prove " that @entity36 was ever in @entity27			1
if he was , @entity88 said , the @entity7 should explain " what a @entity29 operative was doing " there			2
@entity93 gunmen abducted @entity93 nearly three years ago from his home in @entity96 , @entity97			2
they posed as neighbors , offered food and then pistol - whipped the @entity7 aid worker and tied up his guards			2
the 72 - year - old is being held by @entity104 , which released a video of @entity93 at @entity106 , showing him looking tired and pale			2
" nine years ago , i came to @entity97 to help my government and i did so at a time when most @entity7 would not come here , " he said			1
" and now , when i need my government , it seems i have been totally abandoned and forgotten			0
" his daughter , @entity110 , says she 's worried about his health : he has a heart condition and severe asthma			0
she told @entity0 's " @entity116 " on wednesday that the release of @entity2 raised her hopes that her father could be next			2
for years , when @entity93 's case came up , @entity7 officials called for his release but repeatedly said @entity120 would n't bargain with @entity104			1
now , @entity121 says it 's clear that negotiating is an option			0
but she also said she 's worried that the political backlash over @entity2 's case could harm her father 's cause			1
" we started to realize that the administration is going to be a lot less likely to do this again if it causes some political problems for them , " she said			0
" so does that mean that the door is closed for us ? " @entity93 was employed by @entity138 , a @entity7 consulting firm based in @entity139 , @entity140 , that is a @entity142 contractor			2
he is a world - renowned development expert , according to the company 's website			0
" my father is just as deserving of freedom as sgt. @entity2 , as are all of the @entity7 who are being held abroad , " his daughter said			1
@entity152 in october 2012 , @entity153 and her husband , @entity154 , disappeared in @entity5			1
in his last contact , @entity154 , a @entity155 , said they were in an " unsafe " part of the war - torn country			0
@entity153 's family received two videos last year in which the couple asked to be freed from the @entity4 captors			2
the family gave the videos to @entity167			0
in the videos , @entity153 is nine - months pregnant and makes a direct plea to " my president @entity31 for help			0
" " i would ask that my family and my government do everything they can to bring my husband , child and i to safety and freedom , " she says			0
her family had already a posted video of their own on @entity185 two months after she and @entity154 disappeared , appealing for their safe return			2
they said they were concerned about her health and fearful for her unborn child			0
" as parents and soon - to - be grandparents , we appeal to whomever is caring for her to show compassion and allow @entity199 , @entity200 , and our unborn grandbaby to come home , " her father said			0
@entity154 's former wife , @entity203 , is the sister of @entity204 , a former @entity205 detainee who allegedly received training from @entity104			0
their father , @entity207 , was a senior @entity104 leader with connections to @entity210			0
less than two weeks after @entity204 was released from @entity205 and sent back to @entity155 , @entity154 and @entity153 went missing			2
the videos @entity153 's family received offer the only clue about what may have happened to the couple , but provide little proof they were indeed kidnapped			0
no demands for ransom have been made			0
@entity220 officials say they are aware of the video and of the disappearance of the couple and are in touch with the family			0
but they say they ca n't say more because of privacy laws			0
a spokesman for the @entity155 @entity228 says that the government is aware that @entity154 and @entity153 have been kidnapped in @entity5 and is in contact with the @entity5 about the case			1
the six soldiers at center of @entity235 debate @entity0 's @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 contributed to this report .			0
