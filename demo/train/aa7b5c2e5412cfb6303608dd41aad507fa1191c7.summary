-- i 'm a fan of @entity3 ' @entity2 , a @entity6 - lover @entity5 so romantic and vain that he 's preposterously unaware he 's ... well , a kitty cat			1
that said , building an entire animated feature around him turns out to be a bit like making a @entity13 movie with just @entity14			0
in the " @entity21 " films , the joke of @entity2 , with his trilled consonants and penchant for chest - puffing sword duels , is that no one this cuddly should try to be this dashing			2
but in " @entity2 , " that joke wears out its welcome in 15 minutes			1
we 're left with the feeling that @entity2 , as a character , has exactly one dimension : self - deluded @entity32 - macho vainglory			2
he 's like a lost mascot from a taco commercial			0
the movie gives puss a sidekick , the cracked - fairy - tale figure of @entity39 ( voiced by @entity40 ) , who was once his comrade and then betrayed him			2
when the movie plunges into the convoluted backstory of these two , only to emerge from the flashback about 20 minutes later , we begin to realize : the more stuff that happens in " @entity2 , " the less stake we have in it			1
the movie throws in @entity45 ( who are corpulent grown - up grouches ) , magic beans and a beanstalk , a girl kitty ( @entity49 ) dressed , for some reason , as @entity51 , and a whole lot more			0
" @entity2 " is beautifully animated ( with 3 - d that adds nothing ) , but the film is so mindlessly busy that it seems to be trying to distract you from the likable , one - note feline swashbuckler at its center			1
