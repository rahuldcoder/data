@entity0 -- president @entity2 worked behind closed doors to win support among key @entity5 for his health care reform plan thursday , one day after urging @entity7 to hold a final up or down vote on the measure			1
the administration also ratcheted up its campaign against private health insurance companies , summoning a group of @entity14 to the @entity15 and asking them to justify recent rate increases			1
senior democrats , meanwhile , continued to give optimistic predictions about the fate of the president 's top domestic priority			0
house speaker @entity22 said @entity7 is " on the brink of making very important history			1
" @entity15 press secretary @entity25 said he thinks the @entity26 is on schedule to pass the @entity29 health care bill before @entity2 leaves for an overseas trip march 18			1
asked to describe @entity2 's strategy for convincing wavering @entity5 , @entity25 said the president is simply describing " the benefits of the legislation " and " why it 's important for our country			1
" " i have confidence that [ @entity7 will understand ] what 's good for them and good for @entity41 , " @entity25 added			2
on wednesday , @entity2 urged @entity7 to bring the yearlong debate on health care reform to a close			1
he argued that his nearly $ 1 trillion proposal is a compromise plan that combines the best ideas of @entity5 and @entity48			1
he also came out in support of a legislative bypass known as reconciliation , which would allow changes to the health care bill to be passed by the @entity29 with only 51 votes , a simple majority			2
" at stake right now is not just our ability to solve this problem but our ability to solve any problem , " he said			0
" the @entity41 people want to know if it 's still possible for @entity0 to look out for their interests and their future			0
they are waiting for us to act			0
" @entity48 have said repeatedly that @entity2 's proposal amounts to a government takeover of the private health care system that will do little to control spiraling medical inflation			1
in recent weeks , they have repeated their calls for the president to scrap his plan and start over			0
@entity74 leaders also fiercely oppose the use of reconciliation , arguing that it was never meant to be used for such a major policy change			0
multiple @entity79 sources have said the emerging consensus plan is for the @entity26 to pass the @entity29 bill and send it to @entity2			2
a package of changes that mirror the president 's plan would then be passed through both chambers under reconciliation rules			0
@entity22 said thursday that she feels very confident that the changes passed under reconciliation " will satisfy [ @entity15 ] members ' concerns about the @entity29 bill			1
" @entity5 increasingly raised the possibility of using reconciliation after losing their 60 - vote filibuster - proof @entity29 majority in january , when @entity74 sen. @entity95 won the @entity29 seat held by the late sen. @entity97 , a @entity98			2
observers note , however , that it remains unclear exactly which health care provisions can be approved under reconciliation , which is reserved for legislation pertaining to the budget			0
@entity29 @entity48 can also propose an unlimited number of amendments to bills brought up under the procedure			0
another potential problem for @entity79 leaders is abortion			0
@entity15 @entity5 in favor of abortion restrictions have warned repeatedly that they can not vote for the @entity29 health care bill			1
the bill that passed the @entity15 would prohibit abortion coverage in policies made available through health insurance exchanges to people receiving federal subsidies			1
the less restrictive @entity29 bill would allow individuals purchasing plans through the exchanges to pay for abortion coverage out of their own funds			0
most observers do not believe that abortion provisions in the health care bills can be changed under the rules of reconciliation			2
@entity22 tried thursday to assuage the concerns of abortion - rights opponents			1
" if you believe that there should be no federal funding of abortion , and if you believe there should be no change in the [ current federal ] policy , and if you believe that we need health care all for @entity41 , we will pass the bill , " she said			2
" and we will pass the bill			0
