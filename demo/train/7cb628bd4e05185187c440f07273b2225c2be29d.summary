the majority of @entity5 's fuselage has been found in the @entity6 , @entity1 authorities said wednesday , 17 days after the airliner carrying 162 people went down			1
officials have said the fuselage , or the main part of the plane , might contain many of the bodies of those who were aboard the flight			1
authorities do n't yet know why the plane crashed into the sea december 28 while en route to @entity18 from the @entity1 city of @entity20			1
roughly 35 minutes into the flight , the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to avoid bad weather			2
minutes later , the plane disappeared from air traffic control 's radar , @entity1 officials say			1
now that the fuselage has been found , here are some of the tasks that are ahead for searchers and authorities : the fuselage discovery adds to the significant finds elsewhere in the @entity6			2
authorities earlier this week recovered the plane 's cockpit voice and flight data recorders -- which will help investigators determine what happened to the flight -- and lifted the tail section of the craft from the sea on saturday			1
the priority now is to locate bodies , and divers are expected to search the fuselage thursday morning , @entity1 search and rescue chief @entity47 told reporters wednesday			1
as of wednesday night , 50 bodies had been recovered elsewhere , some still strapped into their seats , officials said			0
many of the more than 100 remaining bodies might be found in or near the plane 's fuselage			2
it was n't clear wednesday whether the cockpit is attached			2
@entity47 did n't reveal the fuselage 's depth			0
but officials have said other debris , such as the recorders -- which were found about a half - mile from the fuselage on monday and tuesday -- were generally discovered at a depth of roughly 30 meters ( 100 feet )			1
if divers have trouble accessing the bodies , officials may decide to " lift the fuselage out of the water , " @entity47 said			2
it was n't immediately clear how that would be done			0
to recover the tail section on saturday , crews inflated giant balloons underneath , lifting it from the bottom of the sea			0
a crane then lifted the tail onto a ship			0
both the flight data recorder and the cockpit flight recorder are expected to help investigators understand what went wrong			1
the flight data recorder , which stores a vast amount of information about the aircraft 's performance including air speed and cabin pressure , tells investigators what happened on a plane			1
but the cockpit voice recorder tells them why , said @entity101 , a senior official at @entity1 's @entity102 , which is leading the investigation into the disaster			1
" the ' why ' is mostly in there , " he said of the voice recorder , which captures conversations between pilots as well as other sounds in the cockpit			2
investigators say they have successfully downloaded the contents of both devices			0
but @entity101 cautioned that interpreting the information will require a lot of time			0
@entity101 said he expected a preliminary report to be released within a month of the crash			1
but it 's unclear how much information the initial document will contain beyond what 's already been made public			0
the final report containing investigators ' full conclusions will take months , @entity101 said			0
his agency 's final report into @entity128 -- which crashed in @entity1 waters on @entity130 2007 , killing all 102 people on board -- came out more than a year after that disaster			1
meanwhile , @entity134 , a former inspector general of the @entity136 @entity135 , told @entity2 that because the recorders ' data had been downloaded , investigators should have " a pretty good idea within a couple of days " of what happened aboard the plane			1
but @entity134 added that she did n't think officials would release any information publicly for a couple of weeks			0
@entity148 aviation experts are helping the @entity1 investigation , which also expected to involve @entity150 , the manufacturer of the downed @entity151			1
observers have suggested that the locations of the different parts of debris indicate the plane broke apart when it hit the water , not when it was still at a high altitude			0
@entity5 has said it will pay about $ 124,000 to the families of each victim -- $ 100,000 mandated by @entity1 's @entity162 's regulations , and $ 24,000 for what the airline called " financial hardships " relating to the initial search period			1
that is below the amount guaranteed by the @entity169 , a treaty that governs compensation for the families of air disaster victims			0
but @entity1 did not sign the treaty			2
families may be able to pursue larger claims through courts , @entity174 reported			0
it could be some time before the families to receive @entity5 's payments			0
in the case of @entity183 , which vanished in march , families received some initial payments but final amounts have n't been settled , according to @entity174			0
@entity2 's @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 , @entity174 's @entity196 , and journalist @entity197 contributed to this report .			0

divers are expected to search the fuselage thursday morning
data from cockpit voice and flight data recorders have been downloaded
a preliminary report will be released within weeks , @entity1 official says
