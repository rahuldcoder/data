the art of preparing , stuffing , and mounting animal skins is called taxidermy , and it can range from classy to creepy depending on whether your subject is a moose , or , say , a homeless drifter			2
of course , proper taxidermy is primarily reserved for hunting and fishing trophies , and it sort of works like this : @entity11 drinks two dozen @entity12 in the woods with friends			0
@entity11 pays taxidermist to turn bear into furniture			0
@entity11 puts bear in living room			0
@entity11 's kids wet bed until they 're 33			0
and that 's if the mounting is done well			0
because quality taxidermy really depends on the skill of the taxidermist , and a simple hunting mount can turn exponentially more creepy if it is n't done with precision or mild sobriety			0
" hey ! hey ! look what i made ! " " is that ... @entity34 looking for a contact lens ? " " it 's a deer			0
" but even for those of us who do n't necessarily enjoy the idea of killing animals for the sake of impressing dinner guests , somehow it 's not all that difficult to be amused by terrible craftsmanship so , although i 'm sort of weirded out by this practice ( and , hey , to each their own ) i can absolutely appreciate bad taxidermy			0
and , now , there 's a new , popular @entity50 feed about just that			1
it 's called @ @entity53 , and it 's completely dedicated to images of the very worst animal mountings			2
not to be confused with @ @entity56			2
the @entity50 account was started by a guy in the @entity59 named @entity60 , who requested to only be identified by a one - word name			1
he loves taxidermy and @entity67			0
beyond that , we know very little about the man behind the account			2
but we do understand that @entity60 started the @entity50 account only about a month ago , and was inspired by something that , really , all of us should get to see at some point in our lives			1
he explains : " i started the page after i saw the pole dancing polar bear in a museum and thought poorly executed taxidermy might interest others			2
soon , people started catching on to his feed , especially in the last week			1
which should help him keep it updated with new images going forward			0
@entity60 says , " people send me pictures of creatures they have seen and all i do is post them on my @entity50 with a hilarious caption			1
" good effort ! that said , @entity60 made it very clear to me that he is , in fact , an animal lover and does not condone hunting for sport or animal cruelty			1
but , you know , if you 're gon na do it anyway ... how ' bout a photo ? bad taxidermy on the @entity106 is actually nothing new			0
for example , about five years ago a woman in @entity110 name @entity108 started a @entity113 blog called @entity114			1
it 's all the same fun , but with an extra " p " and a " y. " for those of you keeping score -- and @entity118 knows i am -- @entity114 boasts itself as " the @entity124 's oldest and largest image gallery of crappy and awesome taxidermy since 2009			1
" but @entity108 has a wonderfully positive attitude about the new kid in town			1
" we 're completely unaffiliated , " she says , adding " i love what they 're doing , though ! " @entity108 explained that " blogging is n't a zero sum game , and everyone wins when you spread the love for this particular type of taxidermy			1
i just like making people laugh			0
" and besides , things are going fairly well for @entity108			1
she even has a book coming out this fall			2
however , to confuse matters , the book is actually being titled " @entity144			0
" just like @entity60 's twitter feed			1
the reason for the name change , @entity108 explained , is that her book is actually being published by a @entity59 publishing house , and that @entity59 people do n't use the word " crappy			1
" which explains @entity60 's use of the word " crap			1
" of course , despite @entity108 's carefree attitude toward @entity60 's @entity50 feed , it might ultimately come to blows when the publishers get involved with marketing the book			1
in the meantime , @entity108 maintains her day job as an active - wear designer , but says she 's actually going to have to try her hand at taxidermy			2
and there 's no way out			0
for the book , she is going to write a tutorial on how to stuff a mouse			0
and her good friend , @entity174 , happens to be an insect preparatory for the @entity176 , and also a hobbyist taxidermist			0
are n't we all ? @entity179 will be giving @entity108 a private lesson at her apartment , and @entity108 's only real concern is that she 'll barf			2
but , you know , if you 're gon na do it anyway ... how ' bout a photo ? follow @ @entity188 on @entity50 .			1

a @entity59 man named @entity60 started his @ @entity50 feed about a month ago
since 2009 , a popular blog about the same thing has existed under the name @entity114
@entity108 runs @entity114 and is working on a new book about the subject
