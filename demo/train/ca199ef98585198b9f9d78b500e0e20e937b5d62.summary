-- human remains have been found on the wrecked @entity6 , possibly answering what happened to the last two missing people from the cruise liner that struck rocks off @entity4 's @entity11 in 2012 , a spokesman for the head of @entity4 's civil protection agency said thursday			1
divers will try to recover the remains , which were found on deck 4 , on thursday afternoon , the spokesman said			1
the discovery comes a week after engineers finally righted the ship , which capsized when it hit rocks in the @entity18 in january 2012 , killing 32 of the 4,200 people on board			1
the toll of 32 includes the two people who were missing but presumed dead : @entity23 of @entity24 and @entity25 of @entity26			1
their bodies were long believed to be either trapped beneath or inside the ship			2
tragedy transforms island paradise @entity23 , 33 , was a cruise waiter who was last seen helping passengers off the ship			2
@entity25 was on the cruise to celebrate her 50th birthday with her 17 - year - old daughter , who survived			0
authorities say the ship struck the rocks off @entity11 after the captain , @entity43 , ordered the liner to veer more than four miles off course to salute a former sea captain who had retired on @entity11			1
how the ship was raised @entity47 faces charges of manslaughter , causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board			2
his trial , which began with preliminary hearings in march , resumed monday in @entity56			0
@entity47 argues that he is a hero who saved the lives of more than 4,000 people , not a villain whose negligence led to the deaths of 32			0
his defense is trying to prove , among other things , that the ship 's watertight doors did not function properly , and that is the reason the ship sank , leading to all 32 deaths during evacuation			1
engineers rotated the ship back to vertical last week after it rested 20 months on its side			1
the unprecedented maneuver , called parbuckling , exposed a twisted mass of metal dotted with mattresses , passenger luggage and deck chairs on the ship 's previously submerged starboard side			2
with the @entity6 now upright , judges on wednesday agreed to @entity47 's request for a new examination of the ship			1
he also wants to walk the judges through the command bridge in a re-creation of the night of the crash			0
inside a wrecked cruise ship @entity47 also has told the court that the ship would not have crashed had his helmsman executed his instructions			0
according to recordings from the ship 's bridge from the vessel 's black box , @entity47 directed the helmsman to turn " hard to starboard " in @entity101 , but the helmsman can be heard asking " hard to port ? " the helmsman then turned the ship right instead of left just 13 seconds before it hit the rocks			1
a maritime expert has testified that those 13 seconds made no difference , saying it takes longer than that to change a ship 's course			2
but @entity47 told the court that if the helmsman " had not turned the wheel the wrong way , we would have avoided hitting the rocks			0
" the trial is expected to last through the fall with a string of witnesses , including passengers , crew members and islanders , who say they saw the captain on shore looking for dry socks before all the passengers had been safely evacuated			0
the helmsman , @entity131 , and four others were convicted in a plea deal in july for their role in the disaster			0
a @entity137 court is considering the validity of those plea bargain agreements			0
