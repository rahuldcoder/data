the @entity1 government caught 172 sharks , and killed 50 of the largest animals , as part of a culling program that has sparked anger among conservationists			1
the three - month program , which ended last week , used baited lines attached to floating drums to catch sharks off popular beaches in @entity1 following a spate of fatal shark attacks in waters off the state in recent years			1
the scheme , which was part of the state 's $ 20 million shark mitigation policy , allowed for tiger , bull and great white sharks measuring longer than 10 feet ( 3 meters ) hooked on the drum lines to be destroyed			1
some 50 tiger sharks longer than 10 feet were killed between january 25 and april 30			2
the largest one , which measured 14.8 feet ( 4.5 meters ) , was caught in february off @entity29 's @entity28 beach			2
not the right culprits ? but none of the creatures captured were great white sharks , the species believed to be responsible for most of the recent fatal attacks in @entity1 , which have left seven people dead in the past three years			1
under the program , another 14 sharks measuring less than 10 feet died on the drum line and four more were destroyed because they were too weak to survive , according to the government 's figures published wednesday			2
@entity1 's fisheries minister @entity43 hailed the shark mitigation policy a success , saying it was restoring confidence among beachgoers and contributing to research about shark behavior			1
" the human toll from shark attacks in recent years has been too high , " @entity43 said in a statement released to the media			0
" while of course we will never know if any of the sharks caught would have harmed a person , this government will always place greatest value on human life , " the minister said			0
conservationist 's nightmare but the scheme has been criticized by environmentalists who say the sea predators should remain protected species			0
" of the 172 sharks that were caught on the drum line , the majority were tiger sharks which have n't been involved in shark fatalities for decades in @entity1 , " @entity69 shark campaigner @entity68 told @entity70			2
more than 70 % of the creatures caught on the drum line were n't large enough to be considered a threat or were other animals , like stingrays , @entity68 said			0
while monitoring the government program , @entity69 found that sharks released alive were in a " state of shock " known as tonic immobility and sank to the ocean floor , she said			1
hi - tech initiative as part of its shark research and protection policy , the @entity1 @entity87 is working on a satellite - linked shark tagging program that allows beach safety authorities to know , through near real - time alerts , if a tagged shark is in the vicinity			1
under the three - month cull scheme , 90 sharks were tagged before being released alive			0
other animals caught on the line were freed , including seven stingrays and a north - west blowfish			0
beach closures due to shark sightings were also down this year , according to government figures			0
there were 93 closures in 2013 - 14 , compared to 131 the previous season			0
the @entity1 government is seeking approval to extend the program for three more years			1
