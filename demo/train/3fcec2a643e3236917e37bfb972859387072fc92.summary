-- @entity1 is to trim his schedule to focus on 2013 's four major trophies after a fairytale year in which he won five tournaments and both the @entity8 @entity7 and @entity9 money lists to finish on top of the world rankings			1
the 23 - year - old says a greater understanding of his own game has propelled him to new heights as he gave notice to the game 's great and good that he could dominate the sport for years to come			1
@entity1 's five - star 2012 included his second major at the @entity7 , and he finished the season in perfect fashion by claiming the @entity23 on sunday			1
after topping the world rankings for the first time in his career in march , @entity1 's form has seen him firmly entrenched as the game 's best player , and he told @entity0 that is in part down to greater self assurance			1
" i know myself more , way better as a golfer , and what works for me , " he told @entity33 anchor @entity32			0
" some things that i tried to incorporate into my game did n't work for me and i think you 've just got to find your way a little bit			0
" i guess over the last couple of years i 've done that and winning big tournaments and winning majors , you grow in confidence and it gives you belief , belief that you are doing the right things			2
" @entity1 's performances on both sides of the pond ensured he emulated world no. 2 @entity51 , who last year became the first man ever to top both the @entity54 and @entity9 money lists			1
and despite winning the @entity57 , the @entity58 , the @entity59 and @entity61 titles it is the major tournaments that remain @entity1 's main target			1
to give himself the best possible chance to launch his charge at the quadruple in 2013 , he 's taking his lead from one of the game 's all time greats -- his rival and friend , 14 - time major winner @entity69			1
" i 'm gon na cut my schedule back a little bit next year and try and peak four times a year for the big tournaments , " he explained			2
" i think it 's something that @entity69 has done so well over the years and probably why he 's been so successful			0
" so i 'm going to try and take a little bit of a leaf out of his book and cut down on the schedule and make sure i 'm fresh for every tournament i play			0
" i 'm really looking forward to 2013 already , even though this year has just ended			2
i 'm looking forward to preparing and getting my game in shape for next year			0
" @entity1 ended his final round in @entity61 with five straight birdies to hold off the challenge of @entity91 @entity90 teammate @entity89 , who led by two shots at one stage during a course record score of 62			1
but , watched by his girlfriend and tennis star @entity96 , @entity1 was n't to be denied a fairytale ending to his season			2
" i sort of wrapped up the @entity8 money list earlier on in the season and i guess my one big goal after that was to win the race to @entity61 and and win the @entity91 money list , " he said			1
" i finished second in @entity105 , third in @entity106 and then got the win here			0
it was a big goal of mine			0
i wanted to win the race to @entity61 since the start of the year			2
" the money list in @entity8 was n't so much a priority , but it was nice to get that too			0
it 's been a great way to finish the year			0
" @entity1 and @entity117 have grown close over the course of the year , sitting down together for a special interview on @entity0 's @entity33 show			1
the 23 - year - old , who won his first major at the @entity123 , also sat down for a chat with @entity125 , who is the game 's greatest player with a haul of 18 majors			1
" i guess it 's a little surreal for me , " @entity1 said			2
" i never thought i 'd be able to do it , sitting down with @entity125 and @entity69 on @entity33 this year and doing interviews with them both			0
" it 's been pretty cool and getting to know both of them , trying to get as much advice off @entity125 as i can and a little bit off @entity69 too			0
" i 've got a great relationship with both of those guys and hopefully that can continue			0

@entity1 tells @entity0 he 's *gunning* for all four major tournaments in 2013 golf season

@entity1 says a greater understanding of his own game has elevated his performances
