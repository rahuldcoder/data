-- as 2013 comes to a close , the conventional wisdom is grim : immigration reform is dead			1
expectations ran high ; this was supposed to be the year			0
the president promised action , and the 2012 elections drove home the political imperative			0
but then , after struggling mightily , @entity11 failed to get it done -- again			0
it hardly matters whether you blame the president , @entity14 or the immigration - reform movement			2
there 's still nothing to show for the year			2
â € @entity19 once again , as so often with immigration , the conventional wisdom is wrong			0
the end of the year is n't the end of an inning , wiping out all gains that do n't deliver a man across home plate			1
passing landmark legislation is more like long - distance running : @entity31 builds over the long haul , and progress is cumulative			0
from that perspective , 2013 was a banner year for immigration reform , and we could still win			1
@entity11 could pass a far - reaching immigration overhaul -- in 2014			0
start with the progress made in 2013			2
most important was the sea change in the @entity40			1
it started with the 2012 election and the difference @entity44 voters made for president @entity46 , but the ferment spread and deepened as the truth sunk in among party regulars over the course of the year			0
marquee figures like @entity53 gov. @entity52 showed that the @entity40 can appeal to @entity54			2
he won 51 % of their vote is his reelection bid in november			0
many , if not most , @entity40 in @entity11 now grasp that they need to be part of the solution on immigration -- for the good of the party and the country			1
just look at pronouncements in recent months by @entity66 speaker @entity65 , @entity66 majority leader @entity67 , @entity66 @entity40 favorite @entity68 and many others , including some of @entity11 ' most conservative @entity40			1
the pro-immigration - reform movement also looks completely different today than it looked just 12 months ago			0
a who 's who of @entity73 business leaders has come forward to endorse change : from @entity76 's @entity75 to the @entity78 's blue chip ceo council			2
unlike in years past , when most employers hid from the debate , or at best worked the issue quietly behind the scenes , many companies are now eager to link their names with immigration reform : well - known national companies like @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , but also local mom - and - pop businesses like the 100 small business owners from @entity94 @entity93 who organized this summer to post pro-reform flyers in their shop windows			1
along with business , there has been an outpouring of support from evangelical ministers			0
one @entity93 - based group , the @entity102 , claims to have more than 200,000 @entity104 " prayer partners " lined up nationwide			0
the broader immigration - reform movement does n't always act in its own self - interest : why , for example , the recent @entity108 protest aimed at @entity67 -- one of the leading @entity40 champions of an immigration overhaul ? but together , business and faith voices make a powerful case for reform that combines the economic rationale with a moral imperative			1
most important , neither of these changes -- in the @entity40 or the pro-reform movement -- is reversible			2
this is a shifting of tectonic plates			0
when much of the national @entity40 , the business establishment and the evangelical movement want something done , it 's probably going to get done eventually			1
the question is n't if , it 's when			2
so what 's blocking reform ? the obstacles have little to do with immigration			1
the problem is the same - old - same - old that 's been blocking virtually all movement in @entity93 this year			2
it falls under the general rubric of partisan gridlock , but the real sticking points are more localized : bitter mistrust between @entity66 republicans and the @entity66 , and a divide within the @entity40 driven by a relatively small handful of lawmakers and outside groups who oppose compromise of any kind on any issue			1
the good news is that this month 's budget deal suggests that the logjam may be breaking up			0
together , @entity65 and rep. @entity68 defied the " hell no " holdout wing of their party and delivered a compromise budget , even at a time of peak @entity40 mistrust and antipathy for the president			1
this does n't mean the @entity40 divide has healed -- there were plenty of @entity40 who opposed the budget deal or went along despite their better judgment			2
but the vote has raised hope among immigration reformers			0
can speaker @entity65 and rep. @entity68 pull off a similar deal next year on immigration ? many signs suggest they could , including what 's going on behind the scenes among @entity66 republicans			1
it 's well known that two different @entity40 lawmakers are working , separately , on bills that would create a path to citizenship for young people brought to the @entity73 illegally as children , the " dreamers			1
" and several other republicans are working on proposals that would grant legal status to the @entity184 ' parents			1
in other words , more than a half dozen @entity40 congressmen are preparing to sponsor -- or compete to sponsor -- what many in the party would once have called " amnesty " bills			0
some caveats : @entity66 leadership is not going to pass immigration reform over the heads of conservative @entity40			1
it will pass it only with them -- with their support			0
the @entity66 is not going to take up the @entity205 immigration bill			2
any movement in the @entity66 will be piecemeal , smaller measure by smaller measure , each addressing a different aspect of what 's wrong with the immigration system			1
leadership is not going to waive what 's known as the @entity216 rule , under which every bill that passes must command a majority of the majority -- at least 118 @entity40 votes			2
and there will be no path to citizenship for most unauthorized immigrant adults -- it 's going to be enough of a stretch for the @entity66 to deliver a path to legal status that stops short of citizenship			1
even this will be difficult in an election year			0
the windows to act will be narrow			0
members will be even more cautious and calculating than usual			0
and getting reform over the finish line will be a test for @entity238 as well as @entity40			1
the challenge for the @entity40 will be to pass a package of bills out of the @entity66			1
the challenge for @entity238 , in @entity11 and the @entity66 , will be coming together for a deal on legal status rather than citizenship for most unauthorized immigrants			1
it 's going to be a long year			0
but what makes me optimistic is a growing sense of momentum			0
it 's still slow and low - key , more apparent behind the scenes than in public or in the media			0
but there 's no question : @entity31 is building in the @entity66 -- 2014 could be the year			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity260 .			0

@entity260 : at 2013 end , immigration reform seems dead , but it 's not
she says the year brought big progress , support from @entity268 , evangelicals , even @entity40
she says change slow , but tectonic , likely wo n't include citizenship , but legal status
@entity260 : can @entity66 @entity40 , @entity238 compromise ? it will be *tricky* , but momentum building
