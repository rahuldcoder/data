@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's candidacy received an unexpected boost when @entity7 's @entity6 endorsed him this weekend			1
the publisher wrote : " we are in critical need of the innovative , forward - looking strategy and positive leadership that @entity13 has shown he is capable of providing			1
he did so with the @entity15			0
he did it in bringing in the first @entity18 @entity17 in 40 years and by forging balanced budgets and even a surplus despite the political challenge of dealing with a @entity23 president			1
" say what you will about @entity13 , but he thrives when it comes to the politics of ideas			1
@entity13 , a former history professor , is extraordinarily comfortable when it comes to vigorous and open debates about the ideas of conservatism			1
rarely satisfied with the status quo , @entity13 likes to try pushing the boundaries of what his party stands for			1
" people overvalue money and undervalue ideas , " @entity13 recently told one newspaper			1
" that 's part of the core gamble of this campaign			0
i actually think ideas matter			2
" his candidacy comes at a time when @entity18 have not devoted much time to intellectual introspection			1
for decades , the party became comfortable with the privileges of power			0
republicans spent more time focusing on how they wanted to use their power and protect their political position than on talking about the ideas that the party stood for			0
the @entity18 loss of control of @entity61 in 2006 and horrendous approval ratings of president @entity63 in 2008 led many conservatives to demand that the party reinvent itself from the grass roots up			1
yet the tea party movement has had trouble finding national politicians who were interested , or capable of doing the intellectual legwork that revitalization would require			0
in certain respects , @entity13 fits the bill			1
the @entity74 entered the national scene in the 1970s , an era when @entity18 had no other choice but to pay attention to their core principles			1
@entity23 had controlled @entity61 since 1952 and liberal ideas dominated the worlds of think tanks , academia and journalism			0
from the perspective of conservatives , the only modern @entity18 who had been elected to the @entity17 before 1980 -- @entity87 and @entity88 -- were essentially @entity89			1
@entity90 , also far too moderate in their view , was an accidental president			0
so @entity13 and other @entity18 set out to remake the @entity18			1
attracted by the vibrant conservative movement , @entity13 tapped into the ideas put forth by conservative intellectuals about supply - side economics , deregulation , and anti-communism			1
although president @entity99 was mocked by some as an actor in the @entity17 who followed his script , @entity99 was like @entity13 in that he spent much of his early adulthood deeply immersed in journals such as @entity105 and in reading some of the prominent thinkers of the time			1
throughout the 1970s , this generation of conservatives took ideas seriously			0
they established think tanks such as @entity113 and financed academic scholarship about conservatism			0
elected to the @entity17 in 1978 , @entity13 adopted an unusual political style that mixed the promotion of conservative ideas with hard - nosed political tactics			1
he used his positions in the @entity17 opposition to champion the ideas of the conservative movement , while employing aggressive tactics to challenge @entity23			0
@entity13 went on @entity127 and accused @entity23 of being weak against communism			1
he used the new ethics rules instituted in the 1970s to bring down speaker @entity130 in 1989			0
in 1994 , @entity13 was the key person behind the @entity15 , a 10 - point platform for what the @entity18 would do if it retook control of @entity61			1
while simplistic and a public relations gimmick , it did send the message to voters in 1994 that the @entity18 would be about more than power and patronage			1
rather , its candidates would come to @entity141 seeking to pursue a series of ideas about government			0
@entity13 never had much luck in leadership positions			1
once he was speaker of the @entity17 , his career took a downward turn			0
he had trouble adjusting to the position of being a leader			0
colleagues joked that 70 % of @entity13 could be president , while the other 30 % explained why he was not			2
@entity13 proved unable to tame members of his own party and to bring about a deal			2
his difficulty controlling what he said in front of the media led to embarrassing moments , such as when he was mocked as a " cry baby " for having complained that president @entity167 did n't speak to him on @entity168 on the trip to @entity170 for the funeral of @entity172 ( though the @entity17 released pictures showing that he did ) and that he had to exit the rear of the plane			0
in the end , as the partisan wars led to the @entity17 decision to impeach @entity167 , @entity13 was forced to step aside as a result of his own affair , his ethics violations , and the poor results of the 1998 midterms			2
while it is unlikely that @entity13 , with his personal baggage and lack of discipline , will survive the caucuses and primaries , he could offer republicans a useful boost in the coming months			2
thus far much of the competition among the @entity18 candidates has been remarkably stale , revolving around the rise and fall of quirky personalities or around debates about who is most likely to beat president @entity199			2
while all of these are valid and predictable issues for this stage of the campaign , they do n't offer much to inspire			0
as was evident in tuesday 's debate on national security , @entity13 does n't mind shaking things up			2
he 'll challenge the @entity18 orthodoxy on immigration and raise questions about how the party should handle challenges such as health care			2
he will stimulate other candidates to join in these kinds of debates , thinking through what the party should stand for			0
this would help them make a more compelling case to voters for their candidacy -- beyond simply not being @entity199			0
this is especially important amid the dysfunction in government that keeps @entity141 from doing much about anything			0
the idea man has an important role in @entity233 politics , even if he himself is unable to win office			0
@entity13 fills that role , giving republicans a candidate who is thinking more seriously about what the party is trying to accomplish and how to command the loyalty of voters for years to come			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			2

@entity4 got the endorsement of the @entity7 @entity247
@entity244 says @entity13 aids @entity18 by putting focus on what it should stand for
@entity13 has been more *successful* at promoting ideas than in leadership roles , he says
@entity244 : @entity13 unlikely to win , but his impact will be felt
