@entity1 voters this month ratified a new constitution that enshrines the military , police and intelligence in positions of unprecedented power			1
filmgoers elsewhere could watch " @entity9 , " @entity11 's documentary about resilient revolutionaries -- youth , intellectuals and @entity14 -- fighting for dignity , social justice , economic empowerment and freedom			1
which is the true @entity1 ? both , but the second has been ignored by the @entity22 administration and much of the media			1
in @entity25 as in @entity1 , there are two narratives : 1 ) the army has brought back stability , and the revolution is over ; 2 ) @entity1 have banished fear , if not the regime , and many who led and joined the revolution continue to fight for the same aspirations , while soberly acknowledging the challenges ahead			2
the second narrative comes to life in " @entity9 , " the @entity39 - nominated documentary that tracks @entity1 's uprisings from the inspiring 18 days that began three years ago on january 25 , when protesters crossed @entity43 , to the crackdown on the @entity14 camps last august			1
( full disclosure : i donated $ 90 to the @entity49 campaign that supported the film , and i know director @entity11 and producer @entity51 personally			0
) through the eyes of three revolutionaries who meet in @entity43 during the first protests in 2011 -- @entity55 , a young street vendor who emerges as a charismatic leader in @entity43 ; @entity60 , a third - generation activist and actor ( star of " @entity64 , " and founder of the post-revolution media collective @entity67 ) ; and @entity68 , a member of the @entity14 -- we see the events of the last three years unfold in fits and starts of optimism , betrayal , and disappointment			1
this is the @entity1 that the @entity22 administration has forgotten			1
this is the @entity1 that took @entity25 by surprise three years ago			0
true , the initial promise of those utopian 18 days when the country overcame economic and ethnic barriers to find common cause , has not been redeemed			0
after decades of @entity84 - backed authoritarian rule , @entity1 have no reliable independent institutions , only the ability to take to the streets in protest			1
and now the new military - backed constitution takes that away			0
@entity55 , @entity60 , @entity68 , and their compatriots in " @entity9 " -- such as @entity94 , who is brutally beaten by the security forces for the crime of leading @entity43 in song -- demonstrate that this @entity1 is resilient			2
they may not have learned to organize political parties and to take power in three years , a failing that left first the @entity14 and then the military to fill that vacuum , but they also are not abandoning the struggle for their rights			0
@entity1 activists behind bars on uprising 's anniversary given the film 's portrayal of the military 's repeated attacks on protesters , beginning in march 2011 , it is difficult to understand the infatuation with gen. @entity118 and the army , a sentiment that extends to liberals such as author @entity122			2
recently returned from @entity123 , " @entity9 " producer @entity51 said in a talkback session , " people are beginning to wake up and recognize what the regime is doing to divide @entity1			1
" in a tragic postscript to the film , @entity68 currently is confined to his home -- a common fate for @entity14 members -- unable to work for fear of arrest under the military 's condemnation of the @entity14 as a terrorist organization			0
this is ironic , since @entity68 sided with the revolutionaries against @entity1 's deposed president , @entity141			1
the current @entity1 regime 's policy of outlawing a movement with millions of @entity1 supporters , one that supplied essential social services to the poor , can not end well			2
and where is the @entity84 ? as usual , it has no impact			0
having consistently abandoned those fighting for the goals of the revolution , the @entity84 has steadily weakened its position of influence			0
now the @entity84 speaks to the military to no avail			0
while defense secretary @entity159 dials @entity118 to discourage growing repression , gaining nothing from their conversations , the @entity84 is vilified in the @entity1 media			2
" @entity9 " should be a painful reminder for the @entity166 , @entity167 , and @entity168 of the nature of the military regime the @entity84 continues to back , @entity1 , who already know this well enough , do not have the opportunity to see the film : it languishes in the state censorship authority			1
the military - backed regime surely does not want @entity1 to see the juxtaposition of army leaders promising " not to harm a single @entity1 " with the brutal beatings inflicted on protesters			2
the @entity39 have done what the @entity166 has failed to do : recognize the ongoing narrative of @entity1 's revolution			1
now the @entity1 authorities must allow their countrymen to see their own history			0
there are encouraging signs that the @entity39 nomination has prompted them to review the film 's status			0
the @entity193 screening " @entity9 " in the @entity43 can not come a moment too soon .			0

" @entity9 " is *filmmaker* @entity11 's documentary about @entity1 's revolutionaries
it 's told through the eyes of three revolutionaries who meet in during the first protests
this is the @entity1 the @entity22 administration has forgotten , says @entity206
@entity206 : @entity208 should be a painful reminder to the @entity84 of the military regime it backs
