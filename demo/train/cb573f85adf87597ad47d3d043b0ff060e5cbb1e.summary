@entity0 -- @entity2 proposed friday tax incentives for businesses hiring veterans as well as job training for all service members leaving the military			1
the measure was unveiled as the next piece in president @entity12 's jobs bill and as a remedy to unemployment among veterans			1
" it would basically make sure that our veterans are not standing at the back of any unemployment line , " sen. @entity16 ( @entity17 ) told reporters			2
" it 's important that we support our troops not just by lip - service but by action , and we intend to act next week			0
" noticeable absent from friday 's @entity30 proposal is the job bill 's controversial millionaire 's surtax , which would increases taxes on those with incomes of more than $ 1 million			1
@entity37 have roundly rejected the surtax , saying it would hurt small businesses and stunt economic growth			0
sen. @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , chairwoman of the @entity44 , told reporters they would utilize " existing pay - fors , " or revenue streams , that have been used to fund veterans ' issues			0
" what we did is bring together @entity37 and @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity2 , congressional and administration ideas in putting this package forward			2
i think it uses the best of everyone 's ideas and will make a real difference for veterans , " said @entity56			2
" veterans are not a partisan issue			0
they are something we can all get behind			0
" a major component of the bill would offer tax credits to companies hiring jobless veterans -- up to $ 2,400 in credits for hiring veterans out of work for more than 4 weeks , up to $ 5,600 for hiring veterans out of work for more than six months , and up to $ 9,600 credit for employing veterans with service - connected disabilities looking for work for more than six months			1
the bill would also make mandatory jobs skills training for every service member moving into civilian life and also offer older veterans additional @entity87 benefits for training programs at community colleges and technical schools			1

a cost estimate for the bill was not immediately available			0
@entity56 said @entity2 plan to attach the veterans ' measure as an amendment to @entity53 - passed bill that eliminates the 3 % withholding requirement for government contractors -- a bill that @entity53 and @entity2 @entity37 say would create jobs			1
while @entity2 @entity37 aides indicated the veterans ' assistance proposal and the absence of the millionaire 's surtax were encouraging , they were cautious and said they would need to see the proposal 's details , including how it would be funded			1
