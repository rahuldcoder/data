@entity3 security services suspect their plan may have been to attack the @entity13 territory on the southernmost tip of @entity3 from the air			1
while their planned date of attack is still not clear , any attack on @entity13 soil during the @entity18 would have generated intense global publicity			2
a paragliding instructor told police saturday that @entity25 , the alleged cell 's @entity27 facilitator , requested to be able to take pictures of a @entity9 shopping mall " at all cost , " said @entity32 , a senior international terrorism analyst who was briefed by @entity3 security services on the investigation			1

being maneuvered into a descent			0

" in the images he ca n't help expressing his joy for the successful try , " @entity32 told @entity0			0
" terrorist innovate and adapt to security measures , we have to always keep this in mind , " he added			0
it is not the first time that terrorists have sought to use remote controlled aircraft in terrorist plots			0
in july @entity73 , a @entity74 resident inspired by @entity7 's ideology , pleaded guilty to a september 2011 plot to fly a remote - controlled plane into the @entity79 and @entity80 capitol with high explosive			0
two @entity82 - @entity81 -- @entity83 ( also known as @entity84 ) and @entity85 -- whom @entity3 security services suspect had been tasked with carrying out an attack , were arrested on a bus travelling towards @entity89			1

@entity25 stands accused of possession of explosives substances			0
according to a statement released sunday from @entity103 , the @entity82 hid their true identity after they were arrested , but @entity3 authorities were able to establish their real names after help from @entity81 authorities			2
the judge noted that @entity80 authorities and @entity9 law enforcement also assisted the @entity3 investigation			1
the arrests were announced thursday			0
experts say the men appear to have constituted one of the most skilled and experienced terror cells seen in recent times , and appear to have been dispatched by @entity7 to carry out an ambitious attack in @entity120			1
@entity83 , the suspected leader , was a former member of @entity121 , the @entity81 special forces , according to @entity3 's @entity123			1
he had training as a sniper and was an expert in poisons , the ministry said			0
@entity32 , of @entity129 's @entity128 , said that according to information passed to @entity3 by several @entity133 intelligence agencies , @entity130 joined training camps in @entity135 and @entity136 , including camps run by @entity136 militant group @entity138 , after leaving the @entity81 special forces outfits			1
according to this intelligence , between 2008 and 2011 @entity130 operated in the southwestern @entity81 republic of @entity142 and the @entity136 tribal districts of @entity144 , transiting between them , @entity32 told @entity0			0
@entity85 , the other @entity82 , had received explosives training in @entity135 , where he become an expert in managing explosives and may have participated in a recent bomb attack in @entity150 , according to @entity3 authorities			1

" he said @entity13 intelligence services were also involved in tracking the suspected terrorist cell			1

@entity25 told a @entity3 investigating judge friday that he was an enthusiast of motorized paragliding and wished to teach his two @entity82 associates how to fly them			1
@entity32 said @entity3 security services have established that both @entity82 received motor - paragliding lessons near @entity164 and may have had some instruction before arriving in @entity3			1
a paragliding hand book in @entity81 was found in their possession , @entity32 said			2
@entity25 , the @entity27 suspect , was ordered detained immediately after his arrest			0
because information obtained by intelligence agencies is generally not admissable in @entity3 courts , @entity3 police and security services had scramble in the past few days to provide sufficient evidence to bring a case , according to @entity32			1
@entity89 security services tipped off their @entity3 counterparts about the probable arrival of the two @entity82 suspected terrorists in may , according to @entity32			1
the @entity89 had been tracking the duo and monitoring their phone calls			2
at one point , they intercepted a phone call in which the @entity82 described @entity3 as a " more easy country to get explosives , " @entity32 said			1
investigators moved to arrest all three men after the two @entity82 appeared to be heading back to @entity89 by bus , concerned that @entity89 may be their target			2
one of them violently resisted arrest , the @entity3 @entity123 reported			2
but police were frustrated by a judge 's refusal to grant an immediate search warrant for @entity25 's apartment after his arrest , according to @entity32			0
investigators feared that may have given the cell time to dispose of additional explosives , he said			0
it took eight to nine hours for the search warrant to be granted			0
@entity204 then drove with @entity25 and an official of the @entity3 judiciary to his residence			2
according to the subsequent judicial report , his wife greeted him by saying " do not worry , honey , i cleaned it all			0
" the agents wrote they noticed a " very strong smell of bleach when moving into the place , " the report said			0
@entity32 said @entity89 security services had asked their @entity3 counterparts not to share intelligence on the suspected cell with the @entity3 judiciary , fearing that open exposure of such information in court -- as required by @entity3 law -- could blow the whole operation			1
dog teams used in the search suggested that more explosives had been present than police found , according to @entity32			2
@entity3 security services believe another target of the alleged terrorist cell may have been a joint @entity80 - @entity3 naval base in @entity236 , @entity3 , near where they were based , and have not ruled out other possible targets in @entity120			0
" the case definetely stresses , once again , how critical cooperation between @entity133 nations is to successfully prevent and combat international terrorism , " @entity32 told @entity0			0
