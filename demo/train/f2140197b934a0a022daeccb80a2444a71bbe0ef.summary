-- in life , @entity1 was a force in creating today 's web , helping write game - changing code in his early teens before turning his attentions to internet activism			1
in death , an apparent suicide that came as he faced federal charges that could have sent him to prison for decades , he became a martyr of sorts -- a champion for a new generation of believers that the @entity4 , and the information on it , deserve to be free			1
now , his story is the subject of a documentary film being released friday			2
" the internet 's @entity29 " is a look at @entity1 's life and untimely death at age 26			1
for director @entity32 , it 's a tale that merges a captivating life story with a look at some of the most important legal , social and ethical issues of the digital age			1
" on the one hand , it was a very compelling personal story that was just , by itself , inspirational and interesting but , ultimately tragic , " said @entity32			0
" then there 's this kind of sharp combination with the issues @entity43 was involved in , which are really , really relevant for our time			1
" i wanted to tell this personal , ultimately tragic , story that also touches on a broken criminal justice system , outdated computer laws " and other issues , he said in a phone interview			2
' @entity54 savant and wise elder ' @entity1 was a digital prodigy who helped craft the internet we know today			1
by age 14 , he had co-written the specifications for @entity60 -- a web - publishing system for delivering content from frequently updated sites like blogs			1
as a teen , he was one of the architects of @entity67 , writing code for the nonprofit devoted to letting creators make their works available for others to share and improve upon			0
at 19 , after a single year at @entity73 , he formed his own company , @entity74 , which would merge with , and help create , @entity74 -- the vast , freewheeling social - sharing site built on the foundation of free - expression and online anonymity			2
" @entity79 , we have lost a wise elder			0
hackers for right , we are one down , " said @entity4 creator @entity82 , in a tweet about the death of a man 31 years his junior			2
' a legal nightmare ' on january 6 , 2011 , @entity1 was arrested by police officers from @entity92 and charged with breaking and entering for downloading more than 4 million documents from a campus digital library			1
federal prosecutors tacked on wire fraud , computer fraud and other charges			0
in all , @entity1 faced up to 35 years in prison and a $ 1 million fine if convicted			1
supporters note that none of the documents he acquired included sensitive personal data or would have netted @entity1 any financial gain			2
@entity106 , the digital library from which the documents came , declined to press charges and asked prosecutors to drop the case			2
two years later @entity1 was found hanged to death in his @entity115 apartment , just two days after prosecutors had turned down his lawyer 's second plea - bargain offer			1
" he certainly was the kind of person who carried the weight of the world on his shoulders , " @entity32 said			0
" while he was rousing the troops for this political cause , he was also going through this kind of personal hell			0
" his film notes that friends described depression - like symptoms in @entity1 and that he suffered from ulcerative colitis , a painful intestinal condition similar to the one suffered by @entity133 front man @entity132 , who killed himself in 1994			1
but @entity32 feels it was the legal ordeal that pushed @entity1 to his final desperate moments			2
" i think it was the two - year legal nightmare that left him exhausted , emotionally and mentally , " he said			0
" i do n't let the case off that easily			0
i think that , without this , we 'd still have him			0
" ' a beautifully crafted film ' " the internet 's @entity29 " was funded in part through a @entity145 campaign and screened earlier this year at the @entity146 and @entity148 film festivals , where it got largely positive reviews			1
" while the film borders on hagiography ... the celebration of what @entity1 accomplished never feels forced or inauthentic , " wrote @entity151 in @entity152			1
" instead , ' the internet 's @entity29 ' is a beautifully crafted film that opens a window on a world not everyone has entered yet , and exposes ways in which both the legal system and the @entity165 government is lagging hopelessly behind technology			1
" @entity167 , writing for @entity169 , said one of the film 's running themes is the question of whether " this generation 's programming magicians " will choose to use their power for purpose or profit			2
" we often see stories of slight , sloppy - looking young coders like @entity1 transformed into national icons by the tech industry , but rarely with such close attention to ethics , " she wrote			2
" @entity32 has delivered a film brimming with outrage			2
" it 's that sort of outrage that turned @entity1 's death into a cause celebre among internet - freedom advocates			1
tributes after death multiple memorials were held for @entity1 , from his hometown of @entity197 , @entity198 , to @entity199 in @entity200 to @entity201 , where attendees included @entity165 senators and representatives who spoke out in favor of the freedom of information online			1
an online movement tagged # @entity210 encouraged academics and others in the public sector to make their writings and other documents freely available online , and many did			0
@entity217 announced new scholarships in @entity1 's name			1
he was posthumously named to the @entity220 , and members of the " hacktivist " movement @entity222 hacked two @entity92 websites , posting calls that @entity1 's death become a rallying point for the open - access movement			1
" that was part of the reason i was so drawn to it , " said @entity32 , who had previously profiled @entity222 in the documentary " @entity228 : the @entity233			0
" " there was obviously this big wave of anger and frustration and sympathy that came out of the internet after he died that was notably not there during his case			0
" it was n't just people who knew him			0
it was people from far beyond the online world where he was a celebrity			0
all kinds of people really responded to his story			0
" to those closest to him , the film is a bittersweet tribute			0
" it 's extremely difficult for me to watch , " @entity43 's father , @entity258 , told @entity0			0
" i think that @entity32 has done a wonderful job presenting who @entity43 was , where he came from , what he tried to accomplish , and what kind of role model he represents to others who can use those skills rather than simply making money as a means to improve the world and make the world a better place			0
" " the internet 's @entity29 " premiered thursday in @entity272 and begins rolling out to theaters in more than 25 cities on friday			1
it is being released simultaneously in multiple digital formats , including on @entity67 , where it will be made available for any use that does not involve making a profit from it			0
