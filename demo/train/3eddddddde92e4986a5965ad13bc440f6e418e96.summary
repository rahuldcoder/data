matching program to save money was not a surprise			0
it is common practice for @entity10 companies to lay off workers , reduce hours , and cut benefits to look more attractive to shareholders , even while posting record profits			2
last year 's decisions by @entity16 , @entity17 , and @entity18 illustrate how layoffs are part of corporate growth strategies			0
usually , layoffs are blamed on uncertainty , the need for efficiency , or the sluggish economy			0
the surprise was when he announced the change , @entity2 's chief executive @entity27 had placed blame for the cuts on @entity32 , which he says would cost the company $ 7 million , and two female employees with " distressed babies " that cost $ 2 million in 2012			1
however , after staff and public outcry , @entity27 saw the light and said his company would reverse its decision to dole out its matching funds to employees ' contributions in one lump sum at the end of the year , rather than match contributions in each paycheck			1
here 's why two newborns and the costs of @entity32 were very unlikely reasons that @entity2 would have to change its 401 ( k ) program to save money : health care costs are unpredictable for everyone , not just new moms			1
after all , a healthy , single man can break his leg or be diagnosed with cancer at any time			0
patients with expensive health care needs one year are not guaranteed to spend a lot on health care in the following year -- and anyone could have a health emergency at some point			0
that 's why we buy health insurance : to protect ourselves against an unpredictable and potentially devastating event			0
a large company like @entity2 is better able to spread the risk across all employees because it has many workers , most of whom are in good health			1
rather than allow employees to sign up for various insurance plans through multiple companies , @entity2 is self - funded			1
that means it pays all claims directly , with a third - party administrator managing the business processes			0
companies like @entity2 that self - fund their health benefits typically buy reinsurance policies to protect them from any exorbitant , unexpected claims			2
in addition , @entity2 employees are required to pay both a share of their insurance premiums and up to $ 6,000 per family in out - of - pocket costs , which means they are already paying a significant share of health - care spending increases			1
so two new moms and their newborns are merely a convenient excuse that companies like @entity2 can use to cut costs to benefit their shareholders and executives ' wallets			1
and why did @entity27 blame @entity32 ? the @entity32 does include fees for insurers and third - party administrators to help fund efforts to stabilize the individual and small group insurance markets			2
in 2014 , @entity2 may need to pay just up to $ 63 per year per insured employee			1
but because @entity2 offers comprehensive coverage to its employees , it would not be subject to the penalties that apply to larger employers that do not provide affordable coverage to their full - time employees , starting in 2015			1
employers can not blame the president for unpredictable health care costs either			0
in the past four years , the rate of national health care spending growth slowed substantially to less than 4 % per year -- half the growth rate of the previous four decades			0
although it 's convenient for employers to blame @entity32 for any instability or changes to health - care spending , the fact remains that the cost of maternity or other benefits spread over a large insured population is minimal			1
in a 2011 report , the @entity136 found that adding a requirement to cover maternity services to individual insurance plans would result in just a 0.52 % increase in spending			0
blaming two new mothers for these sweeping benefit cuts was an awful way to treat employees who are already facing the worst of all possible scenarios : a very sick child			2
it 's a mistake @entity27 should never make again			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153			2

@entity2 blamed 401 ( k ) changes on cost of @entity32 and two sick newborns
@entity153 : it *promptly* reversed its decision after staff and public outcry
@entity153 : @entity32 ca *n't* cost that much : @entity2 is too big and workers pay big costs
@entity153 : maternity coverage cost spread over lots of employees would be minimal
