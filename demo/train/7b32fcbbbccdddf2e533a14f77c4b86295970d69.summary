what really happened to @entity1 ? we know a police officer in @entity4 , @entity5 , fatally shot the unarmed 18 - year - old , but police and witnesses have given different accounts of what happened in the moments before the shooting			1
the confusion has fueled protests in @entity4 and , earlier in the week , strong police response in the streets of the @entity18 suburb			0
here are five key questions about the incident : how did it start ? @entity1 and @entity22 , 22 , were walking in the middle of the street , en route to either @entity1 's grandmother 's house ( according to @entity1 's mother and grandmother ) or to @entity22 's house ( according to @entity22 ) , when a @entity4 police officer confronted them			1
officer @entity33 , who is white , told the young men either " get the f * * * on the sidewalk " or " get the f * * * out of the street , " according to @entity22 's accounts to @entity40 and other news outlets			1
the young men replied that they were " not but a minute away from our destination , and we would shortly be out of the street , " @entity22 told @entity40			0
the officer drove away but stopped and backed up , almost hitting the pair , @entity22 said			0
he said he was n't sure what prompted the officer to return			0
@entity22 told @entity48 the officer said something to the effect of " what 'd you say ? " " we were so close , almost inches away , that when he tried to open his door aggressively , the door ricocheted both off me and @entity60 's body and closed back on the officer , " @entity22 said			2
a caller to the @entity18 radio program @entity63 , on @entity64 , gave what she said was the officer 's version of events			1
her account accurately matches what @entity33 has told investigators , a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told @entity40			2
the caller , who identified herself only as " @entity75 , " said that @entity33 told her that the two young men were walking in the street and he rolled down his window and told them to get out of the street			2
was there a struggle ? yes			0
everyone agrees on this point , and it 's one of the few aspects of the shooting that police have attempted to detail , though the official explanation has spurred many questions they have yet to answer			2
the preliminary investigation showed that the officer tried to exit his vehicle , but @entity1 pushed him back into the car , " where he physically assaulted the police officer " and struggled over the officer 's weapon , @entity18 police chief @entity92 said			1
a shot was fired inside the police car , @entity92 said			0
after the incident , the officer was taken to an area hospital , where he was treated for a " swollen face , " according to @entity4 police chief @entity107			0
in @entity75 's version , @entity33 may have heard a call about a strong - arm robbery and saw the young men carrying something that might have been stolen cigars			1
according to @entity75 , when @entity33 tried to get out of his car , @entity1 pushed him back in , and then punched the officer in the face			1
it was then that @entity33 reached for his gun , @entity75 told the radio show			2
@entity1 grabbed @entity33 's gun , and the officer pushed it away and the gun went off , @entity75 said			1

the officer drew his weapon , and " he said , ' i 'll shoot you ' or ' i 'm going to shoot ' " and almost instantaneously fired his weapon , hitting @entity1 , @entity22 said			1
witness @entity132 was picking up coworker @entity133 for their jobs when she saw @entity1 and the officer " tussling through the window			2
" @entity138 and @entity133 said @entity1 appeared to be trying to pry himself from the officer 's grasp			1
@entity1 had his hand on the police cruiser , trying to push himself away , @entity138 said			2
was @entity1 armed ? @entity144 , this is undisputed			0
every casing found at the scene came from the officer 's gun , @entity92 said , and witnesses say that after the officer initially fired , the two young men took off running			1
" i saw the officer proceeding after my friend , @entity60 , with his gun drawn , and he fired a second shot , and that struck my friend , @entity60 , " @entity22 said			0
" and at that time , he turned around with his hands up , beginning to tell the officer that he was unarmed and to tell him to stop shooting			2
but at that time , the officer was firing several more shots into my friend , and he hit the ground and died			0
" this matches @entity133 's and @entity138 's story			0
@entity133 told @entity40 that @entity1 got about 20 feet away from the police cruiser before the officer shot him again			1
" the cop gets out of his vehicle shooting , " @entity138 said			0
" ( @entity1 's ) body jerked as if he was hit from behind , and he turned around , and he put his hands up			2
... the cop continued to fire until he just dropped down to the ground , and his face just smacked the concrete			0
" a private autopsy conducted for the @entity1 family showed that @entity1 had been shot at least six times , including twice in the head			2
@entity75 , recounting the officer 's version of events , told the radio program that after the first shot went off inside the car , @entity1 and his friend started running , and @entity33 pursued as protocol dictates			1
according to @entity75 , @entity33 told the young men to freeze , and the pair turned around			0
the officer 's account is that @entity1 started to taunt him , saying he would n't shoot him , and then rushed at the officer at full speed , @entity75 said			1
it was then that @entity33 started firing , @entity75 said			0
she said that in the officer 's opinion , @entity1 " was on something			1
" according to her , the final shot hit @entity1 in the forehead , and he fell two or three feet in front of the officer			1
a new witness , @entity201 , told @entity40 's @entity202 on wednesday that @entity33 fired at @entity1 after the teen ran about 20 feet			1
@entity201 ran out of his apartment to get a closer look			0

he took a step or two towards the officer but did not charge him , @entity201 said			0
@entity33 fired three to four more shots at him , he said			0

the @entity1 family lawyer , @entity228 , said that the person in the video appears to be @entity1			0
read the police reports @entity22 , who was with @entity1 when he was shot , will not face any criminal charges in connection with the store robbery because " we have determined he committed no crime , " @entity107 said			1
@entity107 initially said that the officer who shot @entity1 was responding to a call about the robbery			1
later , @entity107 revised that comment , saying the officer approached @entity1 not because of the robbery , but because he was " walking down the middle of the street , blocking traffic			2

" @entity1 's family and their attorneys were infuriated that police released @entity33 's identity and allegations of @entity1 's role in the robbery on the same day			1
