-- the head of one of @entity4 's biggest animal protection organizations said thursday that @entity5 , who served prison time for his role in a deadly dogfighting operation , should have the opportunity to bring a dog home -- in due time			1
@entity13 president @entity12 told @entity15 's @entity14 that the @entity17 quarterback should n't get a pet immediately and should have to meet certain milestones whenever he does			1
but @entity12 , whose group has worked with @entity5 in public outreach efforts , said that it would be wrong to close the door to his ever having a dog again			1
" he 's been going through counseling , he 's been speaking to kids twice a month , and he needs to interact with animals , " said @entity12			1
" if he continues to hit these markers , then if his daughter wants a dog two or three years down the line , ... i 'm saying that we should be open to that possibility			2
" under the terms of his conviction , @entity5 is currently barred from owning an animal			0
but the @entity40 , @entity41 , native this week told @entity42 , a news website focused on an @entity45 audience , that he would " love to have another dog in the future			0
" " i think it would be a great step in my rehabilitation process , " @entity5 said			0
" just to have a pet in my household and show people that i genuinely care , ( to show ) my love and my passion for animals , i think , would be outstanding			0
" @entity57 , the author of the book " the @entity62 " about the animals that were killed and those that survived from the ring that @entity5 belonged to , questions the extent of @entity5 's love for animals given his conviction			1
" it 's a common thing among dogfighters : in one sentence , they 'll talk about how much they love these dogs , and the next sentence they 'll talk about how they force them to fight , " the author told @entity15 's @entity14			2
" it 's hard to take him at face value , ( given ) what he 's done , " added @entity57			0
" he was arms deep in this process of abusing and killing these animals			0
" the @entity84 indefinitely suspended @entity5 in august 2007 after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation in @entity41			2
@entity5 left a @entity88 prison in may 2009 to serve the last two months of his 23 - month sentence in home confinement			1
the @entity91 , which claims support from 11 million people , bills itself on its website as the country 's " mainstream force against cruelty , exploitation and neglect " of animals -- including the very kind of dogfighting rings and killings for which @entity5 was convicted			1
after being released , @entity12 said that @entity5 approached the group " to help ... combat that problem			1
" the society president defended his group 's partnership with @entity5 , saying that it has helped spur a new conversation about the reality of dogfighting			1
@entity12 said that the quarterback has personally talked with thousands of children regarding an issue he first learned about as an adolescent , helping start a dialogue that 's led to animal protection clubs popping up at several inner - city schools			2
" what he did is terrible , there 's no question about that , " @entity12 said			2
" but this is an issue of protecting animals in the future			0
and endlessly flogging @entity5 is not going to save one animal			0
but putting him to work in communities to save animals and educate people about the problem of dogfighting -- especially with at - risk kids -- is the way to help the problem			0
" " thousands now are being reached , " he added			0
" we 've never had a conversation with them before			0
" @entity5 's off - the - field past has done little to diminish his popularity on the field			1
according to @entity84 , he currently ranks first in fan voting for the @entity143 -- above all other players , at all other positions			0
still , @entity5 has acknowledged publicly that his rehabilitation is not yet complete			0
and as much as @entity5 might potentially save some dogs by making the public more aware of fighting rings , @entity12 said that having him interact with dogs should benefit @entity5 personally			1
the @entity91 plans for public interactions at first , during which he might even attend " end dogfighting classes " with others			2
" animals have a healing quality to them , " @entity12 said .			1

@entity91 president @entity12 says he 's open to @entity5 having a dog
the star quarterback was sentenced to 23 months for his role in a dogfighting ring
the author of a book about @entity5 's dogs doubts his *sincerity* about loving animals
@entity12 says @entity5 would benefit , adding , " animals have a healing quality to them "
