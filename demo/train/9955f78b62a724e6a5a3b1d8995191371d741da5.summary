-- just one week ago @entity2 were united , railing against the man - made evil known as @entity5			1
they hated it so much , they said , they would tie the funding of the government to the defunding of the dread program			2
sure , they had tried more than 40 times to get rid of the plan before , but they had never done this : attach the plan to kill it to a must - pass piece of legislation			2
it was an idea born of necessity , some now tell me			2
republicans in the @entity26 had been hit over the head in their districts by ads run by conservative political action committees ( paging sen. @entity31 , who appeared in some )			1
the rap against them : they had not worked hard enough to slay the evil dragon			0
the charge , having been plastered all over tv , was leveled against them at town hall meetings over the summer			0
they came back to @entity40 very angry at @entity41			2
so the plan to defund @entity5 -- and tie it to a measure to fund the government -- was hatched			1
never mind that @entity26 speaker @entity46 was already on the record saying he did n't want to do that			1
he had no choice but to capitulate : if he did n't adopt the strategy , he would face a revolt			2
who wants that when you 're just back from summer vacation ? so defunding @entity5 became the new war cry			1
it passed the @entity26 , went to the @entity57 , where @entity31 then promptly told reporters it would die			1
at that moment , @entity31 morphed from the @entity59 into the man on the most wanted sign			1
he had left them out on a limb			0
" he 's a demagogue , " one senior @entity26 @entity2 told me , then going on to detail how @entity31 was shooting " his own team from behind " and other choice descriptions			1
so @entity31 had no choice but to mount his own faux - filibuster , which went nowhere			1
the @entity57 passed a clean bill to fund the government , and the rest is history			0
but a funny thing happened on the way to the national stage : the president decided not to cave , and @entity2 treated this as if it were shocking that he would not gut his single biggest legislative achievement			1
but something else happened , too			0
the health care exchanges -- the heart of @entity5 -- came online , and it was a mess			1
the @entity26 that had been lauded for its technical acumen suddenly looked like a bunch of @entity88			0
the system crashed , bobbed and frustrated			0
the @entity26 refused to release reliable numbers so the public 's level of participation could be gauged			0
it landed with one big thud , which would have been a big problem for the administration , except for this : nobody was talking about it , because the country was preoccupied with the shutdown			2
so @entity2 had accomplished the seemingly impossible : they trampled their own message on @entity5			1
they finally had a great hook			0
but what were they doing instead ? scrambling to find ways to re-fund parts of the government to curb public outrage			0
oh , and by the way , we could wind up paying all of those furloughed workers			0
sure , this is n't their fault			0
but look at it this way : a government drowning in red ink is paying people not to work			0
all of which brings us up to date in this dysfunctional story			0
so @entity5 had a crashing start , the government is shut down , and the deadline to raise the debt ceiling is a week away			1
and the debt ceiling , as you know by now , is the bigger problem : no @entity132 checks , no @entity133 , high interest rates , and on and on			2
everyone -- save for some debt ceiling deniers -- believes it ca n't happen			2
so what to do ? if you look closely here , you will see that something very profound has changed : @entity2 seem to have pressed the delete key on talk of defunding @entity5			1
they ca n't get it done			0
their poll numbers are tanking			0
and some cooler heads i have spoken with are privately making the same point : was n't it always unfair to promise people something the @entity2 knew they could never deliver ( defunding @entity5 ) ? so @entity46 , no fool , carefully turned the page on all of this , moving to the terra firma he always wanted to be on in the first place : deficit reduction			1
tie a package of spending cuts to raising the debt ceiling , he says			1
that 's what has always been done			0
we are being reasonable about this			0
no , says the president			0
you 're not being reasonable			0
you tried to kill my health reform bill , so no negotiation until you fund the government and raise the debt ceiling without anything attached			2
in the end , they will probably find a short - term way to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling and continue to argue over spending and taxes			1
but the @entity26 @entity2 scheme , abetted by @entity31 and outside conservatives , will become a case for the civics classes			1
a study of the newly perverse politics of our time , and how a government was brought to its knees over a fight only a few wanted to wage -- that everyone secretly knew could never be won			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			2

@entity195 : @entity2 have *quietly* *abandoned* strategy to defund @entity5
she says they secretly knew it was *hopeless* but felt forced into it by @entity31 , others
@entity195 says shutdown news *overshadowed* sputtering start to @entity5
she says @entity46 is back to where he wanted to be : urging spending cuts for debt limit deal
