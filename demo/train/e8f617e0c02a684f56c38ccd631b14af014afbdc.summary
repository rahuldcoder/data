-- @entity2 paleontologists friday safely removed the largest fossilized mammoth tusk discovered in the region from a construction site , according to the @entity6			1
the fossil is probably a tusk from a columbian mammoth , or @entity10 , which was designated the @entity12 fossil in 1998 , according to a statement on the museum website			1
the tusk , 8 feet 6 inches long , appears to be the most intact and largest discovered in @entity2			1
the fossil was found tuesday about 7 feet below an @entity18 apartment development site , the statement said			2
@entity20 paleontologists estimate that the tusk is at least 16,000 years old , but could be up to 60,000 years old			1
carbon dating would provide a definitive age			0
" the tusk presents a rare opportunity for paleontologists and other researchers to understand the paleoenvironmental conditions present in @entity2 during the ice age , " the statement said			1
@entity31 , senior vice president of @entity18 , said in a prepared statement that the excavation will cause a construction delay , " but the scientific and educational benefits of this discovery clearly outweigh the costs and delay			2
this is an exciting discovery for our local @entity40 history			0
" the tusk was taken to the museum , which has paleontology collections that include 25 mammoth fossils from @entity46 , most of which are skeletal fragments and were found in @entity2			1
@entity20 paleontologists earlier removed dirt from around the waterlogged tusk with shovels , trowels and brushes , and placed layers of plaster - soaked burlap bandages on one side of the tusk , the museum said in a statement			1
the plaster was meant to protect the tusk when moved			2
the drying process could take at least 12 months , during which time @entity20 conservators will remove the plaster and repair any damage to the tusk			2
" since the tusk is on private property , it could have ended up in a private collection , " said @entity69 , the museum 's curator of vertebrate paleontology			1
" we are very fortunate that @entity18 contacted us to remove and care for the tusk			2
" according to the museum , contemporary ice age mammals include giant ground sloths ( @entity81 ) like one found at @entity83 airport and now on display at the @entity6 , and extinct bison ( @entity86 ) , among others			0
" conditions were much colder and drier than today , and the region was probably covered with grassland and occasional pine trees , akin to the northern edges of modern boreal forests , " the statement said			0
mastodons and mammoths are ancient elephant relatives that once inhabited @entity99 , the statement said			0
both became extinct as glaciers receded at the end of the ice ages between 10,000 and 11,000 years ago			0
mammoths , which were larger than mastodons and much more closely related to elephants , arrived in @entity99 from @entity107 about 2 million years ago , according to the museum			1
" @entity10 grew to 12 feet at the shoulder , taller than woolly mammoths ( @entity112 ) and about the size of the modern @entity107 elephant ( @entity116 maximus ) , " the museum website said			0
" their very long tusks curved down from the face , then upward at the ends			0
columbian mammoths were herbivores , with a diet that included grasses and conifers			0
they chewed grass with large , flat , washboard - like teeth that are very similar to the teeth of modern elephants			0

new : fossilized tusk from likely columbian mammoth removed from construction site
@entity137 is at least 16,000 years old , but it could be up to 60,000 years old , a museum says
it appears to be the most intact and largest discovered in @entity2
