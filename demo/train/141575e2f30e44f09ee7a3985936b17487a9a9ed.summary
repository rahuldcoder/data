-- @entity1 was n't supposed to rule @entity2			1
he grew up in the shadow of his father , the late president @entity5 , and his older brother , who was groomed to be the next president			1
but the deaths of his father and brother thrust a young @entity1 into power			1
now , a bloody crackdown by his regime on pro-reform demonstrators is defining his rule			2
reports of deaths across the country trickle in almost every day			2
the government has maintained the same narrative : it is targeting armed terrorists			2
but opposition activists say it is a systematic , sustained slaughter on civilians by the @entity5 regime			2
and the @entity28 is moving toward calling for @entity5 to step down , government sources said			2
politics were n't in @entity5 's original career path			2
he studied medicine in @entity32 , receiving a degree in ophthalmology , and headed the @entity35			2
" dr. @entity1 , " as he was widely known , liked to windsurf and play volleyball			1
but he switched his focus to military science after his older brother , @entity39 , died in a 1994 car accident			1
when his father died in june 2000 , it only took hours for the @entity2 parliament to vote to amend the country 's constitution to allow @entity5 to become president			1
the parliament lowered the age of eligibility of the president from 40 to 34 , allowing the son to take over			2
within weeks , @entity1 was also made a member of the regional command for the ruling @entity53 , another requirement of succession			1
in the beginning , @entity1 was viewed by some as a fresh , youthful leader who might usher in a more progressive , more moderate regime			1
but more than a decade into his rule , amateur videos of violent protests and bloodied bodies paint a gruesome picture of the conflict in @entity2			1
human rights groups say such scenes are evidence of @entity2 security forces firing on their own people , though state - run media disputes such claims			1
initially , protesters wanted basic reforms , more freedoms , a multiparty political system and an end to emergency law			1
some of these reforms have , on paper , been implemented by @entity1 , but they were far too little and , by the time they came about , too late			1
@entity2 have lived in fear of political repression for decades			1
@entity5 ruled with an iron fist for three decades , ruthlessly putting down dissent by jailing dissidents and crushing the opposition			1
for more than 47 years , the country had been under emergency law , which effectively suspended most constitutional protections , according to the @entity92			0
the law authorized the government to conduct preventive and arbitrary arrests , according to the @entity96			0
security forces did n't need to obtain arrest warrants , and suspects were detained for prolonged periods without charge , trial or access to lawyers			0
amid the conflict in recent months , @entity1 lifted the state of emergency and abolished a court set up to try people posing a threat to the regime			1
but at the same time , arbitrary detentions have continued , as has the use of force against demonstrators			0
@entity115 , now 45 , denies he is a dictator , seeing himself instead as a modern leader			0
his official website says he has built free - trade zones , licensed more private newspapers and private universities , and fought government waste and corruption			0
he has also worked on social and economic reform			0
while there have been some changes during his rule , many say @entity1 's promises have largely not been delivered			1
@entity129 has called his time as president " the wasted decade " with a media that remains state - controlled , a monitored and censored @entity133 and prisons still filled with dissidents			0
activists say that with the current protests , however , @entity1 can no longer look away			1
" he has to start listening , " said @entity138 , executive director of the human rights group @entity139			0
" it 's the time to start listening and acting			0
he ca n't afford any more promises			2
" other analysts say force may have worked in the past to quell dissent , but not this time			0
" the government is going to try to continue to use the tactics that it has for a very long time , which is just to snuff out any protest , " said @entity146 , a professor of politics and international affairs at @entity149			0
now , however , " the wall of fear is coming down			0
" the late president was a cautious , slow - moving tactician , and while his son 's style may appear modern , he was still schooled in the old @entity161 way			0
in 1982 , the @entity2 military -- acting under orders from @entity1 's father -- brutally crushed an uprising in the western city of @entity167			1
estimates of the number of casualties vary from 3,000 to 40,000			0
in early august , scores were once again reportedly killed when tanks rolled into the city , which has been a center of the anti-government movement roiling the country			0
many activists are already comparing the havoc now in @entity167 to the massacre there in 1982 -- but say it is happening in slow motion rather than in a single , devastating strike			0
@entity0 's @entity183 and @entity184 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 has ruled @entity2 since 2000
his older brother died in a 1994 car crash
the death meant @entity1 was the next heir to power
despite some reforms , *critics* *highlight* empty promises
