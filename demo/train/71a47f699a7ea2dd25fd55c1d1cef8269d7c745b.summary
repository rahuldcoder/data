-- it is one of the most remarkable images of the @entity4 -- and no one is watching			0
as the thoroughbreds stampede around the bend at @entity9 's most prestigious horse race , a lone woman darts onto the track			1
in a shocking instant she is mowed to the ground by one of the animals galloping at more than 55 kilometers per hour , her hat rolling away as she is trampled beneath the pounding hooves			0
yet take a closer look at the famous 1913 photo of suffragette @entity21 sprawled on the @entity24 race track , and you 'll see the majority of spectators are not straining to see the tragic scene -- but the winning horse crossing the finishing line			1
this saturday marks 100 years since the feminist gave her life in a grisly -- and mysterious -- protest for women 's right to vote , throwing herself in front of the @entity37 's horse during the most high - profile sporting event on the planet			1
" @entity21 's actions were of huge significance , " @entity40 , @entity9 journalist and daughter of former @entity43 mp @entity42 , told @entity0			2
" she cared enough about a principle - that women should have equal political rights - to sacrifice her health , her reputation with the establishment , her comfort , her safety and ultimately her life			2
" feminism 's forgotten hero ? but a century after her horrifying death , how many people would be able to name one of the women credited with helping bring about the vote for @entity9 females ? while 1950s @entity65 civil rights protester @entity64 made history for her refusal to give up her bus seat , and @entity70 democracy campaigner @entity69 famously endured house arrest throughout the 1990s , the name " @entity21 " has failed to gain such international recognition			1
" very few women - or men - would be able to name her , " said @entity42			2
" a lot of it was due to the lack of widespread , mainstream media at the time -- limited photography , film , newspaper coverage			0
@entity84 was filtered through very few , limited sources -- and all of those were in the hands of powerful men			0
" despite the huge coverage -- film technology was in its early days but the remarkable incident was captured on three newsreel cameras -- many newspaper front pages instead led on the winning horse			1
" the big story in the papers the next day was the winning horse @entity102 having the title taken off him for alleged rough riding , " @entity96 , horse racing historian and author of the ' @entity99 , ' told @entity0			2
" the press treated @entity21 as a mad , middle - aged crank who had tried to destroy a pleasant day of sport for the masses			0
" four days after she dashed beneath the pounding hooves , @entity21 died in hospital from her horrific injuries			1
the 40 - year - old passed away amid public condemnation , with the queen mother reportedly sending her apologies to the jockey that the race had been interrupted by a " brutal lunatic woman			2
" it 's unclear whether @entity21 intended to commit suicide at the @entity24			1
she was carrying a return train ticket and a banner , with some historians now suggesting she instead wanted to attach the banner to the royal racehorse @entity127			0
a militant campaigner born in @entity129 in 1872 , @entity21 studied literature at @entity131 before working as a teacher in an era when a woman 's place was as a dedicated wife and mother in the home			1
at 32 she joined the @entity139 -- known as the @entity140 -- a campaign group for women 's right to vote , who carried out militant protests such as chaining themselves to railings and prison hunger strikes			1
on the night of the 1911 census , @entity21 hid in a broom cupboard in the @entity150 so that when asked to fill out the form , the address of a woman without the vote would , ironically , be @entity155			2
in 1999 , @entity40 's @entity156 father , @entity42 , fitted a brass plate to the crypt door to commemorate the audacious protest			2
" what 's interesting is how @entity21 's tactics so suit a later age -- which is more dramatic and media - savvy , " said @entity40			2
" there was certainly controversy about the suffragettes ' methods -- many thought they were publicity - seeking and destructive and too elitist -- and there was tremendous dispute within the movement about their tactics			0
" @entity21 was arrested nine times for her demonstrations and even in prison was a force to be reckoned with -- throwing herself down an iron staircase and going on hunger strikes			0
white funeral while @entity21 's fatal @entity24 protest divided opinion , her coffin procession through the streets of @entity129 -- including a haunting sea of suffragettes dressed in white -- had the appearance of a " state funeral , " said @entity96			1
" it was arguably bigger than @entity191 's funeral , " he added			0
" the suffragettes held her up as a heroine			0
in death , she became a martyr			0
" five years after @entity21 's death , in 1918 , women aged over 30 won the vote in @entity9			1
ten years later the age was reduced to 21 -- equal with men			0
" her legacy today is an enfranchised female population : a growing number of women in mainstream politics ; the first woman prime minister ; a much more equal society , " said @entity42			1
" but we still have a long way to go			0
four fifths of @entity155 are men -- it is a very masculine place			0
" @entity96 however , argues that the outbreak of @entity213 the following year did more to help the women 's movement than @entity21 's deadly protest			1
" it was more of a result of the female contribution to the war effort , that the first movements were made to giving some concessions to women , " he said			0
one thing is certain , 100 years ago @entity21 paid the ultimate sacrifice in her for equality -- with a fearlessness that still resonates today .			1

100 year *anniversary* of @entity231 's death at @entity24
militant campaigner ran in front of @entity37 's horse , died four days later
*legendary* feminist , yet many women today would *n't* know her name
five years later , women over 30 given right to vote . her legacy still disputed
