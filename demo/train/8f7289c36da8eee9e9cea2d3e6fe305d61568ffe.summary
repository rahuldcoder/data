-- the @entity1 voted saturday to attend next week 's peace talks in @entity3			1
the secret balloting among 75 representatives of @entity9 's main opposition group , which have been meeting this week in a luxury hotel on the outskirts of @entity12 , resulted in 58 votes in favor and 14 opposed , with two abstentions and one person who handed in an unmarked ballot , the coalition 's media office told @entity0			1
but the tally masked deep divisions within the opposition : another 44 members of the group refused to vote at all			2
and some of those doing the fighting in @entity9 have said that participation in the talks would be an act of treachery			2
nonetheless , @entity30 secretary of state @entity29 applauded what he called " a courageous vote in the interests of all the @entity9 people who have suffered so horribly under the brutality of the ( president @entity37 regime and a civil war without end			1
the top @entity30 diplomat promised that he 'd engage " directly with the @entity9 opposition and the international community " when the conference starts next wednesday			1
" by voting to go to @entity3 2 with a mission to negotiate an end to the war , the opposition has chosen a path that will ultimately lead to a better future for all @entity9 , " @entity29 said in a statement saturday			1
the goal of the talks -- dubbed @entity3 2 in recognition of a similar effort in the @entity56 city in 2012 -- is to set up a transitional government that would end the violence that has wracked the country since march 2011 , killing more than 100,000 people			1
@entity29 explained late last week that the meeting 's goal is to implement the communique that was the fruit of the first such meeting			2
" it is about establishing a process essential to the formation of a transition government body -- governing body -- with full executive powers established by mutual consent , " he told reporters			0
any names put forward for leadership of @entity9 's transition must , according to the terms of @entity3 1 , be agreed to by the opposition and the regime led by president @entity79 , according to @entity29			1
" that is the very definition of mutual consent , " he continued			0
" this means that any figure that is deemed unacceptable by either side , whether president or a member of the opposition , can not be a part of the future			0
" in addition , he said , it " defies logic that those whose brutality created " the current situation could lead @entity9 toward a better future			0
the peace conference would not be the end , but the beginning of a process , he said			0
@entity100 has said he does not look at the talks as a way for him to transition out of power			0
on friday , his foreign minister announced that he 'd given his @entity106 counterpart a proposal " to determine the time and date where there will be an end to the military operations " in @entity113 and urged him to help broker its passage			1
" we will wait for @entity116 ( @entity119 ) @entity118 to tell us the time and the date , the hour , and we will commit ourselves to these arrangements -- if he has enough guarantees that the other side will accept and commit themselves as well , " @entity9 foreign minister @entity116 said			0
if that succeeds , he said , @entity124 is prepared to extend the plan to other areas of the country			0
meanwhile , state - run @entity9 media reported saturday that the first shipment of aid has reached the @entity132 outside @entity124 , where dozens of people have died of starvation and lack of medical attention since the camp was cut off by warring factions last november			0
@entity139 : haunting images of @entity9 's abandoned homes @entity0 's @entity142 and @entity143 in @entity144 , plus @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 in @entity148 contributed to this report .			2
