-- i 'm one of those people who wo n't throw out electronics just because they 're outdated			1
if a device is still working and potentially useful , i 'd rather get it into the hands of someone who will continue to use it			1
and even when devices are broken or useless , i ca n't bring myself to landfill them -- i save them up for local electronics recycling drives			1
but even though i take steps to keep my old electronics out of landfills and environmentally disastrous overseas disposal does n't mean i 'm willing to spend large amounts of time and effort to figure out what to do with them			1
i bought a @entity23 last month			1
since then , my two - year - old @entity24 has been gathering dust on my dresser			2
that @entity24 served me well enough for a long time , and there 's nothing really wrong with it			2
i 'd love to pass it along to someone who wants it			2
... well , ok , there is one thing wrong with it : a few months ago i made the mistake of updating its operating system to @entity36 , which drastically slowed its performance			2
( cult of @entity39 , @entity40 and many other venues are reporting the same problem			2
) this problem apparently is reversible , but not easily so -- and i just do n't feel like trying			2
i 've got many more pressing concerns			2
my phone 's @entity36 performance problem is severe enough that i would be embarrassed to give this phone as a gift to anyone i know , or even to sell it directly to another party via @entity51 or @entity52			2
so i found a middleman to shield me from embarassment , keep my old @entity24 out of the landfill and let me make some easy money all at the same time			2
i 'm selling my old @entity24 -- as is -- to @entity57 , a " @entity58 company " that says it provides " a practical , responsible , rewarding way for consumers to get value for used electronics			1
" in less than a minute @entity57 agreed to buy my old @entity24 for $ 93			1
this week they 're sending me a box to ship it to them , and after they 've checked out the phone they 'll paypal me the money			0
( i 'll report back if that part of the process does n't work as promised			0
) admittedly , $ 93 is less than half of what people here in the @entity74 are asking today for an @entity76 on @entity51 ( although that may not be the price they 're actually getting )			0
and it 's toward the low end of the price range for what folks are asking for this phone on @entity52 today			0
so yes -- if i want to sell my old @entity24 , i definitely could make more money elsewhere			0
my time is worth money			0
avoiding hassle is worth money too			0
frankly , if i had to deal with the hassles and risks of selling this phone myself via @entity51 or @entity52 , and also reverting it back to an older os so it 's bearably functional again to assuage my conscience , that @entity24 would keep sitting on my dresser until the next electronics recycling drive			1
and then i 'd have to pay someone to take it away			0
so for me , that $ 93 is a total gain			0
@entity57 spokesperson @entity100 explained that the company , which buys over 20 categories of electronics products in addition to cell phones , ends up " finding new homes " for more than 90 percent of the used devices they buy			1
mostly they resell devices through sites like @entity52 or @entity112 , or through wholesalers			1
" our brand appeals mainly to the upgrader market , the gadget geeks , the people who always want the latest devices , " she said			1
" there tends to be a large secondary market for their used devices , which normally are n't very old			1
" for instance , before the @entity124 was unveiled june 7 , @entity57 was getting about 25 used iphones per day			1
but as soon as @entity24 users knew when they could get their new model , trade - ins on the site soared to 1500 units per day for two weeks			0
since then it 's tapered off ( currently about 500 per day )			0
@entity100 noted that there also is a thriving global market for refurbished older devices , such as a four - year - old @entity136			1
" we tend to resell those for reuse overseas , " she said			0
@entity57 has a no export / no landfill policy for recycling and disposing of products at the end of their useful life			1
this applies to their own operations and those of their downstream partners			0
@entity57 also follows the @entity153 's @entity152 ( @entity155 ) practices -- which is a good start , even though a recent @entity158 report points out that the federal agency " does not specifically regulate the export of many other electronic devices , such as cell phones , which typically are not within the regulatory definition of hazardous waste despite containing some toxic substances			1
" the @entity57 site did not ask me which operating system is on my @entity24			1
their short list of questions concerned the physical condition of the hardware , which accessories i have , etc. i asked @entity100 whether , given the widely reported troubles with @entity36 on the @entity24 , they 'd start taking that into account into the price they offer on trade - ins			0
" right now we sometimes ask those kinds of questions , but only about computers , " she said			0
" as phones become more like computers , we might start to pay closer attention to that			0
" however you get rid of your old cell phones , be sure to protect yourself with proper precautions to delete your data			0
also , remove your sim card ( if your phone has one ) .			0
