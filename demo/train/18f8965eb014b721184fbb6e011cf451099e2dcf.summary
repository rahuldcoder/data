-- when my airplane touched down in @entity3 , @entity4 , i could not stop grinning			1
the trip last weekend fulfilled a lifelong dream to visit all 50 states			1
at age 31 , i reached my goal			2
@entity4 may not be at the top of many travel wish lists -- it was n't on mine -- but its layered history offers many memorable experiences			1
i took an airport selfie right away , holding a map of the @entity17 on which i proudly wrote , " i 've been to all 50 states ! " it 's a map my dad pulled out of a phone book when i was a kid , penciling in the year we checked off each state			1
i 've carried that simple map along on my travels , slowly filling it in			0
collecting states is a family tradition			1
my sister @entity27 reached 50 states when she was 21 and two of my uncles reached it in their 40s			1
my father has been to 49 states and my mother has been to 48			2
by the time i was a year old , i had been to 10 states , and by the time i was seven , i 'd visited 25			1
over the past four years , i 've traveled frequently for work , often visiting 20 to 25 states a year , and i have been to most states multiple times			1
there 's a lot of debate around what counts as a visit			1
some people believe you need to stay overnight or eat a meal			0
in my family , we say you need to stand on the ground in the state			1
despite all of my travel , i 've had to make a handful of dashes across a border to cross off a state still on my list , but even those trips create lasting memories			2
when i was 22 , my cousin @entity63 drove my sister , other relatives and me from her home in @entity67 across the borders of @entity69 and @entity70			0
the occasion for our visit was very sad : her mother had just died from ovarian cancer			2
but driving us to neighboring states is what her mom would have done if she were alive to help us with our goal , @entity63 said			1
for @entity81 , @entity82 , and @entity83 , i tacked solo road trips onto business travel in neighboring states , driving up to 600 miles round - trip just to check off a state			1
in the other 45 states , i 've spent time meeting people who live there , sampling the food and the local attractions			2
i 've had @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100 in @entity101 , hush puppies in @entity103 , fried dill pickles in @entity97 , huckleberry ice cream in @entity104 and poke in @entity105			0
50 states , 50 spots for 2014 i 've lived in seven states from coast to coast , and i do n't identify any one of them as home			1
the nation is my home , with its diverse landscapes , communities and landmarks			0
@entity117 , a college degree in history heightened my curiosity about the places i 've studied			2
history is filled with a mixture of tragedy and triumph , and @entity4 certainly fits			1
capping off my @entity17 tour in @entity4 was a meaningful way to end , but in truth visiting @entity129 last was accidental			1
i thought a trip to a wedding in @entity105 with my partner @entity132 in january would fulfill my goal and i even bragged about it on @entity135			2
but then i dug up my dad 's map on the day of our flight and saw that both @entity4 and @entity83 were blank			1
i visited @entity83 in february and my mom said she 'd meet me in @entity4 in may			1
she flew from @entity142 while i came from @entity143			0
we planned a trip centered around heroines of history and literature			2
in @entity149 , we stood at the very spot where @entity151 boarded the racially segregated bus in 1955 and refused to give up her seat			0
a number of other women , many of whom worked at the nearby university , had been brainstorming a bus boycott and jumped into action that night			0
after 13 months , their boycott worked			0
we drove down to @entity163 , the hometown of @entity164 , where we watched a play based on her 1960 book " @entity168 " at the courthouse that inspired the setting in her book			0
the 1903 courthouse is now a museum with exhibits about @entity176 and her famous neighbor @entity177			0
this literary classic ranks among my favorite books , and it felt likes stepping back in time to see the volunteer actors perform it in @entity176 's hometown			2
before the performance , we followed a walking tour map to @entity189 's @entity188 , the spot where @entity176 's childhood home had once stood and paid silent homage to her			0
the literary tour continued in @entity195 because my mom and i love the @entity198 - power of the movie " @entity200 " ( 1991 ) and the book that inspired it , " @entity200 at the @entity203 © " ( 1987 ) by @entity204			0
@entity204 's great aunt co-owned the @entity206 © , which was the inspiration for the fictional @entity208 ©			0
as a steady stream of trains whistled by , we tucked into greasy , tasty fried green tomatoes and other @entity213 cuisine			0
back in @entity3 , we took another look at some of the state 's most troubling past at the @entity218 -- where four girls died in a bombing -- and @entity221 -- where white people attacked unarmed black children protesting segregation			2
both events occurred in 1963 at the height of the civil rights movement			1
visiting the sites highlighted for us the bravery of those seeking equality and the brutality of those who opposed them			0
we spent hours at the @entity235			0
when we started , there were students running all around us , noisily doing a scavenger hunt , but by the end , we were alone , absorbed in the exhibits			0
. from slavery to segregation to the heroic tactics to end it , the institute tells the gripping , moving story of change through printed words , audio clips and film			0
women were appropriately honored for their crucial role , especially their on - the - ground organizing , something that too many history books and people overlook			0
from visiting national parks and historic landmarks to meeting kind and interesting people in big cities and small towns alike , i 've had many memorable trips			0
but learning more about and honoring women i admire , both real and fictional , with the added benefit of spending time with my mother , puts the @entity4 weekend near the top of the list			2
and of course , thanks to this trip i finally have the bragging rights to say i 've been to all 50 states ! do you have a 50 - state goal ? share your stories and photos with @entity278 and tell us about your experiences below			1
@entity281 runs the nonprofit organization @entity282 , works for @entity283 and the @entity284 , and is an adjunct professor of women 's studies at @entity287 .			1

the goal of visiting all 50 states is a tradition in *author* @entity281 's family
@entity281 just visited her 50th state with a visit to @entity4
her @entity4 itinerary *included* literary and civil rights history
