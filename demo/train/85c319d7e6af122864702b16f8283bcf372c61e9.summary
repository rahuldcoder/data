@entity0 , @entity1 -- averting what could have been another gas crisis across @entity5 , @entity1 and @entity6 have fixed a price on natural gas for 2008 while @entity9 has promised to pay its 2007 gas debts			1
the last - minute deal mirrored a similar situation in 2006 , when @entity1 briefly cut off gas supplies to @entity6 over pricing differences			1
@entity6 is the largest facilitator of natural gas to @entity17 countries , and the disruption caused shortages in @entity5			1
@entity1 president @entity20 and @entity6 president @entity21 announced on tuesday they had reached agreement on the gas issue at a news conference in @entity0 following their talks			1
the @entity1 natural gas company , @entity28 , had threatened to stop supplying gas to @entity6 on monday , then extended the deadline until tuesday evening while talks continued			1
the two leaders said several other issues between the countries had been resolved , as well			0
@entity21 said @entity6 will pay its gas arrears of 2007 and will be a stable transit supplier to @entity5			2
a final agreement will be signed in the next few days and payment for gas already used will begin shortly , @entity20 said			0
after the gas cut - off in 2006 , @entity17 leaders called for solutions that would allow the union to avoid being a victim of disputes between @entity1 and other former @entity47 republics			2
a consortium of countries banded together to fund the @entity51 pipeline , a $ 7.4 billion ( 5 billion euros ) project that will bring gas from @entity54 's borders with @entity55 and @entity56 to @entity54 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , and then on to @entity61 and @entity5 , according to the @entity51 web site			0
construction is to begin in 2009 on the 3,400 - km ( 2,113 - mile ) pipeline , and it 's expected to be operational in 2013			0
but @entity28 , along with @entity66 's @entity65 , is planning a 900 - km ( 560 - mile ) pipeline following a similar route to feed into @entity60 and @entity66 , a project that would cost between $ 14.6 billion and $ 17.5 billion ( 10 billion to 12 billion euros )			0
last week , the managing director of @entity71 , @entity72 , announced that @entity28 may also send gas through the @entity51 pipeline			2
critics say the move would undermine the purpose of the project , which was to reduce @entity79 dependence on @entity1 gas			0
