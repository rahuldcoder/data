it was joyful mayhem friday night in the county clerk 's office in @entity4 , @entity5 , after a federal judge struck down the state 's ban on same - sex marriage , saying the law " conflicts with the @entity12 's guarantees of equal protection and due process under the law			1
" " i proposed to my partner of 27 years in june , but i said , ' we 're not going to get married until we can get married in @entity5 , " state sen. @entity21 , who is openly gay , told @entity17			1
" he said , ' so , that 's just an excuse never to get married			0
as soon as the judge 's ruling was reported , " we ran down here , " @entity21 said as he surveyed the crowd			1
" it 's a madhouse down here			0
there 's hundreds of people , wedding certificates are being issued , there 's marriages taking place all over the hallways			0
it 's just a warm , wonderful moment in the state of @entity5			1
" in striking down the state law , which voters had approved in 2004 , @entity42 district court judge @entity41 wrote in a 53 - page ruling that the state 's " current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and , in so doing , demean the dignity of these same - sex couples for no rational reason			1
" accordingly , the court finds that these laws are unconstitutional , " he said			2
@entity41 said lawyers for the state had offered no evidence that opposite - sex marriage would be affected and that their " fears and speculations are insufficient to justify the state 's refusal to dignify the family relationships of its gay and lesbian citizens			1
" in addition , the @entity67 protects the rights of same - sex couples , including their right to marry and to have that marriage recognized by their government , he said			1
" these rights would be meaningless if the @entity67 did not also prevent the government from interfering with the intensely personal choices an individual makes when that person decides to make a solemn commitment to another human being			0
the @entity67 therefore protects the choice of one 's partner for all citizens , regardless of their sexual identity			0
" the lawsuit was brought by one gay and two lesbian couples in @entity5 who wish to marry but have been unable to do so because the @entity90 prohibits same - sex marriage			1
the decision was greeted with joy from a spokesman for @entity95 , formerly the @entity95			2
" at last , loving and committed couples in @entity5 will have the opportunity to celebrate marriage equality this holiday season , " said @entity96 in a posting on its website			1
" we are seeing state leaders and more and more citizens recognize that loving and committed couples should not be legally kept apart , " said @entity96			2
" we look forward to seeing that momentum to continue in 2014			0
" gov. @entity107 expressed disappointment at the ruling by @entity41 , whom he called " an activist federal judge			1
" @entity107 said he was working with his legal counsel and the acting attorney general " to determine the best course to defend traditional marriage within the borders of @entity5			2
" a spokesman for the @entity117 said in a statement that it supports " traditional marriage , " while teaching that everyone should be treated with respect			0
" this ruling by a district court will work its way through the judicial process , " @entity122 said			2
" we continue to believe that voters in @entity5 did the right thing by providing clear direction in the state constitution that marriage should be between a man and a woman and we are hopeful that this view will be validated by a higher court			1
" the president of the @entity138 , @entity139 , called the ruling " a travesty of justice			1
" in a statement , he added , " this trend of vetoing the voters from the bench must be stopped			2
" that view was not shared by @entity147 , chairman of the board of @entity148			0
" we think it is a thoughtful and careful ruling that is based on the @entity151 decision last summer and we expect that it will be upheld ultimately by the @entity151 , " he said			2
by early friday evening , @entity147 told @entity17 he had signed as a witness to multiple marriages among same - sex couples			1
though the state has already filed a notice of appeal , the state 's lawyers did not file a motion for a stay in district court , which allowed the marriages to begin at once			0
" why they did n't ask the district court for a stay is a mystery , to say the least , " @entity147 said			0
" there are hundreds of people here -- it 's past 5 o'clock and the clerk is not closing the door			0
" same - sex marriage is banned by constitutional amendment or state law in : @entity208 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity177			1
but it is legal in 17 other @entity42 states and the @entity211 : @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity211			0
worldwide , 16 other countries ( and parts of @entity224 ) have laws allowing same - sex marriage and domestic partnerships			1
most of these are in @entity235 and @entity236			0
civil unions , which are legal in @entity181 , grant couples most of the rights of state civil marriages , but provide none of the federal benefits of marriage , such as @entity245 benefits			2
these rights include spousal support , medical decision - making privileges , access to a partner 's insurance , and hospital visitation rights			2
though the @entity42 @entity151 has signaled that it is reluctant to issue a national opinion on the matter , lower courts and states have not been so reluctant , said @entity258 , a professor of constitutional law at the @entity260			0
" i 'm just struck by how quickly this is all moving , " he said			0
" it just seems like it 's picking up steam in terms of challenges			0
" he attributed the change to a greater acceptance of gays and lesbians , especially among young people			0
" they just do n't see this as a great moral issue that needs to be something codified as a prohibition in the law , " he said			0
" everybody knows gay people -- either in their families or friends or workplaces -- so what 's the big deal ? " president @entity284 signed the @entity285 banning federal recognition of same - sex marriage and defining marriage as " a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife " in 1996			1
last june , the @entity42 @entity151 rejected parts of @entity285 , in a 5 - 4 decision that dismissed an appeal over same - sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds and ruled same - sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits			1
on thursday , the @entity224 @entity151 ruled unanimously to allow same - sex marriage statewide and ordered county clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to qualified same - sex couples .			1

ruling is " a travesty of justice , " @entity138 president says
laws " demean the dignity of these same - sex couples for no rational reason , " federal judge writes
lawsuits were brought by three same - sex couples who want to marry
decision strikes down a @entity5 law approved by voters in 2004
