-- former @entity2 sen. @entity1 passed away recently			0
although he was known for many things , @entity1 's most enduring moment came in the middle of the @entity6 , when he asked : " what did the president know and when did he know it ? " the scandal happened 40 years ago			1
it started with a break - in at the @entity14 headquarters in @entity15 and it was followed with subsequent efforts to obstruct an investigation into whether the @entity18 had been involved			0
in july 1974 , the @entity19 ruled 8 - 0 that the @entity18 had to turn over recorded presidential conversations to the investigators			0
the @entity22 voted in favor of the three articles of impeachment , charging president @entity26 with obstruction of justice			0
the watergate scandal had a devastating effect on @entity31 politics			1
in his riveting forthcoming book , " @entity40 , " @entity32 skillfully recounts the era that was shaped by the scandal and the way in which the sordid activities of the @entity26 administration unfolded on a day - by - day basis			1
each revelation gave voters another reason not to trust their elected officials and to believe the worst arguments that people made about government			1
americans could never look at government the same way again			2
the scandal continues to reverberate today throughout the political spectrum			1
we still live in the era of @entity6			1
for @entity14 , who many thought would have been the beneficiaries of a scandal that brought down a @entity59 president , the level of distrust that the scandal generated among the public has been an ongoing challenge			2
at the most basic level , @entity14 argue that the federal government offers the best solution to the problems of the day			2
but if the public does not trust its elected officials , democrats are left in a position of having to constantly defend the legitimacy of the institutions of government and to convince voters that bureaucrats really will do their job			1
the intense skepticism surrounding the @entity80 , @entity81 and the @entity83 scandal have revealed how easy it is for opponents of government to stoke these kinds of fears			1
@entity59 have suffered too , even after the party separated itself from @entity26 as its figurehead			0
the truth is that @entity59 promote government as well , just for different reasons			2
their programs have , likewise , been subject to constant scrutiny as a result of the lingering distrust from @entity6			1
for conservatives , national security programs have been a centerpiece of their agenda			0
@entity59 have pushed for expanding the military budget and since 9/11 many have called for an aggressive response to terrorism that includes sweeping surveillance programs and enhanced interrogation techniques			0
revelations about what government officials do without public accountability -- such as torture or snooping into e-mails -- have deepened public distrust and created strong pushbacks			1
politicians in both parties must operate in a political environment filled with investigations , or accusations of another scandal looming with the suffix " gate " attached to it			1
whenever some kind of scandal breaks , it does n't take long for the story to escalate and for questions to arise as to whether this will end up as big as @entity6			1
often , this outlook has salutary effects by encouraging politicians to make sure that similar levels of corruption do n't happen again			2
but , too often , as many would say has been the case with the @entity83 , stories of administrative mismanagement are blown out of proportion , consuming @entity15 's time and taking their attention away from major problems			0
the worst effect of @entity6 is that it created a climate where @entity31 fundamentally do n't trust their government			1
it is one thing to be suspicious , another to reject altogether			0
recent approval ratings for @entity144 tanked to 7 % and for the president 29 %			0
this is part of the broader trend we have seen since the 1960s			0
it is extremely difficult for government to do its job or for voters to have the kind of faith in government , which is necessary for a healthy society			2
when @entity1 asked his famous question , his hope was not to disparage government but to make it better			2
he wanted to find the corruption , to seek the reform so that government could do its job once again			0
unfortunately , the kind of faith that @entity1 had in government never returned			0
to really banish the memories of @entity6 and set the government on a better course , reforming politics is the most important solution			1
improving our campaign finance system by curbing the influence of private money and imposing stronger restrictions on lobbying , such as the revolving door between the government and lobbying groups , is an essential first start			0
until we take those kinds of steps , voters will always be seeing the shadow of @entity26 when they look at their elected leaders .			0
