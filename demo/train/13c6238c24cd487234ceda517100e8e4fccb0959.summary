@entity0 -- we are seeing the deadliest sectarian violence in @entity4 since 2008 and that is causing major setbacks for @entity8 's aspiration to challenge @entity9 as the top oil producer			1
the latest figures from @entity4 's ministry of energy illustrate the direct link between the violence and the country 's oil output			1
in may , monthly production hit nearly 77 million barrels in the two major regions @entity20 and @entity21			2
that sunk , the ministry said , to fewer than 70 million in june as daily production tumbled to less than three million barrels a day			2
according to the @entity26 , the death toll jumped from 595 killed in april to 963 in may -- and more than 1,000 were killed in july			0
this is a quick turn of fortunes after @entity4 surpassed neighboring @entity29 as the second largest oil producer within @entity31 last year , hitting a peak of 3.4 million according to @entity33 in its latest report on the country			1
a couple of years ago , @entity4 said it would achieve daily production of 12 million barrels a day by 2020			1
the ministry lowered those expectations to nine million and strategists say that remains ambitious			0
one would think that @entity4 would do everything to guard its prized facilities			2
pipelines have been attacked , some fields missed production targets , and the cost of production has risen			2
the inability to protect those fields suggests that the general security situation is worse than expected in many corners of the country			0
but this goes well beyond sectarian violence and the @entity59 - @entity58 divide that has wracked this country for the past decade			1
the central government , under prime minister @entity60 , opted to take a tough line when putting up giant fields for auction in the last few years			0
instead of production sharing agreements ( psas as they are known ) when international oil producers take a percentage of each field , @entity8 went with service contracts -- paying companies only for services such as workers and technical advice			1
oil executives suggest that earns them well below $ 5 a barrel , when @entity80 @entity79 is trading well above $ 100 , and where it has been for a record three years running			0
with little upside potential in those fields , there is little appetite for risk either on the production side or when it comes to security -- hence the challenges we are seeing as the violence stretches into a fourth month			1
while this is a tricky country to navigate as the situation grows more uncertain , it is fair to say the oil majors do n't want to be shut out of this market longer term			0
emerging market oil producers have taken the same view -- both the @entity103 and @entity104 producers have been active on the ground , as well regional players from the @entity107			0
@entity108 , ceo of @entity110 based @entity109 in the @entity111 , says the current level of @entity4 's proven oil reserves -- 141 billion -- may be too conservative			1
" i for one think once they are fully explored they could even be higher than @entity9 , number 1 , " @entity108 said when we toured his natural gas facility in the @entity116 earlier this year			0
that is saying a great deal , since @entity31 pegged the kingdom 's reserves at 265 billion barrels in 2012			0
" the issue is how to develop those reserves and that is where the challenge lays			0
there are infrastructure issues , security issues in other parts of the country but the big challenge is policy , " said @entity108			0
a major policy roadblock remains a national oil law which will govern how revenues are carved up throughout the country			0
@entity109 took an early risk to go back into @entity4 in 2007 , but did so in the @entity143 region where the investment laws and production sharing agreements are in place			1
@entity4 is earning over $ 90 billion a year at current production levels , nearly matching the budget for the central government			1
the problem , those who follow the country suggest , is not enough is going back into building a first class network for distribution			2

@entity4 is experiencing the deadliest sectarian violence since 2008 and oil production has fallen
*global* oil companies in @entity4 are paid for their services rather than getting a share of profits
this means the companies have little appetite for risk , @entity1 's @entity168 says
there are fears @entity4 is not investing enough in its oil distribution network , he says
