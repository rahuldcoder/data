@entity0 -- the @entity2 has tossed out government fines against @entity4 and its affiliates for airing the infamous shot of brief nudity involving singer @entity8 during the @entity9			1
friday 's action follows the court 's separate , unanimous ruling this month in favor of broadcast television networks			2
the justices said in that free - speech dispute that the @entity17 imposed unfair punishment for isolated profanity and sexual content during evening " prime time " hours			0
the @entity17 had imposed a $ 550,000 fine against @entity4 and its affiliates for airing the " wardrobe malfunction " incident involving @entity8 and @entity25 during the professional football championship game 's halftime show			1
the @entity29 had told the high court there was no " fleeting images exemption from indecency enforcement " and that the singer 's act was " shocking and pandering , " airing " during a prime - time broadcast of a sporting event that was marketed as family entertainment and contained no warning that it would include nudity			0
" but @entity4 countered that the government in recent decades has applied inconsistent rules to indecent words and images , punishing some instances and ignoring others			1
a three - judge @entity48 - based 3rd @entity50 panel last november agreed , finding for a second time the @entity17 had acted " arbitrarily and capriciously , " since the commission did not give the media companies proper prior warning about subsequent changes in its enforcement policies			0
chief justice @entity57 said friday he was " not so sure			1
" high court rules for broadcasters on tv ' indecency ' " the agency never stated that the ( fleeting expletives ) exception applied to fleeting images as well , and there was good reason to believe that it did not , " he wrote			0
" as every schoolchild knows , a picture is worth a thousand words , and @entity4 broadcast this particular picture to millions of impressionable children			1
" the chief justice himself is the only member of the high court who is a parent of two school - age children			0
but @entity57 nevertheless agreed with his colleagues to dismiss the government 's appeal , in light of the @entity17 's newly clarified policy allowing for no exceptions to fleeting expletives or images			1
" any future ' wardrobe malfunctions ' will not be protected on the ground relied on by the court below , " warned @entity57			1
after viewer complaints and national media attention , the @entity17 said the @entity8 incident was obscene			1
in addition to @entity4 , 20 of its affiliates also were fined			2
@entity94 quickly reacted at the time to the visual shocker by increasing the limit on indecency fines tenfold , up to $ 325,000 per violation per network			0
and it said each local affiliate that aired such incidents also could be punished by the same amount			0
the @entity17 claimed the network had " alarm bells " something might have been up , suggesting @entity8 and @entity25 may have planned ripping off the woman 's bustier , exposing her breast for nine - sixteenths of a second			2
the television networks say their scripted shows no longer air nudity , racy images or expletives , even after 10 p.m. , when some potentially vulgar words may be permitted			0
they worry , however , about unplanned , often spontaneous indecent or profane incidents at live events , such as awards shows and sporting events			0
@entity124 officials say such programs are often on a five - second delay , and censors are on hand to bleep any offensive language			0
but some indecent words can slip through , they admit , and they want to be protected from heavy government fines			2
the " wardrobe malfunction " case is @entity17 v. @entity134 ( 11 - 1240 ) .			1

new : @entity57 : " any future ' wardrobe malfunctions ' will not be protected " by this ruling
the @entity2 *erases* the fine against @entity4 for the @entity142 " wardrobe malfunction "
