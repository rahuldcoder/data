@entity0 -- in the battle for the @entity4 , nine races will play a role in determining the balance of power			1
@entity7 currently hold six of the seats while @entity9 hold the other two , meaning that the @entity7 must defend their territory -- a difficult task in a midterm election with a @entity7 president who has low approval ratings			1
here 's a short synopsis of the key races that @entity7 are working to keep in their hands : @entity18 : sen. @entity19 is another freshman senator who is facing a difficult road to reelection			1
he won his last race by fewer than 4,000 votes in the red state			0
he is distancing himself from president @entity25 and touting his pro-energy credentials			0
he could face one of three republicans			0
their primary is august 19			0
@entity30 : this is one of the most @entity9 states in the country			1
president @entity25 received only 37 % of the vote in 2012 and sen. @entity35 is locked in a race with rep. @entity37 , a @entity9 backed by both conservative and establishment elements of the @entity9			1
@entity39 : since her first @entity4 race in 1996 , sen. @entity40 has had a tough road to election			1
now running for her fourth term , republicans are still trying to unseat the centrist @entity46			0
this year she will face off against one of several @entity9 challengers , including rep. @entity49 , who is considered her biggest threat			1
@entity39 runs its elections a little differently			0
november 4 , @entity52 for the rest of the country , is considered @entity39 's primary			0
and if no candidate receives 50 % of the vote , a runoff takes place december 6			0
@entity60 : long - time sen. @entity61 is retiring , giving @entity9 their first chance to take a seat in @entity60 since 1994			1
@entity9 @entity64 is staging a competitive race against @entity7 rep. @entity66			1
@entity68 and @entity4 key races to watch @entity69 : @entity70 categorizes this race as " lean @entity9			1
" sen. @entity72 is running as an incumbent , appointed to the seat after @entity75 left to become ambassador to @entity77 , but that status is thin in the conservative state as he 's only been in office since february			0
rep. @entity81 is the likely @entity9 candidate			2
@entity82 : sen. @entity83 is running for her second term			0
it 's still unclear who she will face in the november election as republicans are battling it out for that party 's nomination			0
but her likely challenger is state house speaker @entity93			0
while she will have to run against her @entity9 opponent , she also will have to run against her public perception as she faces approval ratings of only 35 % , according to an april 8 @entity99 / @entity98 poll			2
@entity100 : sen. @entity102 's retirement opens the seat up to a possible @entity9 win			1
rep. @entity105 will be the @entity7 candidate and the @entity9 field is crowded			1
but if no @entity9 candidate obtains 35 % support in the primary , then the candidate is chosen by a conservative state convention			2
@entity9 are also playing in @entity112 and @entity113 , which means they have multiple paths to retaking the @entity4			1
but @entity9 are defending two key seats that could make it more difficult for them to pick up the majority			1
@entity118 : @entity9 leader @entity119 is in the race of his life			2
he is being attacked by the @entity123 wing of the party with a challenger , @entity125 , who he 's likely to beat in the may 20 primary			0
then @entity7 have a legitimate chance in the red state with their candidate , @entity130			2
@entity131 : the current @entity9 senator , @entity132 , is retiring , leaving his seat vulnerable			2
@entity134 comes from a family steeped in @entity131 politics and is proving to be a viable @entity7 candidate in this red state			2
over on the @entity9 side , the candidates are beating each other up in a contentious primary and pushing each other further to the right , which could leave the primary winner bruised and too extreme for a general election electorate			2
additionally , primary candidates must win more than 50 % of the vote to avoid a runoff			0
with the crowded field , a runoff is possible , adding another challenging element to @entity9 efforts to keep this seat			0

republicans must pick up six seats to win control of the @entity4
six @entity7 races and two @entity9 races are key to the balance of power
