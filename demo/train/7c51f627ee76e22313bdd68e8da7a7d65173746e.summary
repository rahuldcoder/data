-- every parent loves his or her child ; it 's the prime directive of the species			2
twenty years ago , when my wife was pregnant with our first baby , @entity6 told me that having a child is like taking your heart out of your body and letting it walk around			2
for some parents , however , their beloved child takes their heart on a long , wild ride that careers from joyous and generous to dark and dangerous			1
so it was with @entity23 and @entity24			2
@entity25 , their third child , was a precocious reader , a super-sensitive old soul , fiercely defiant when he believed the teacher was too autocratic , hyper - quick on the trigger			2
or , as his father put it , a squirrelly kid			2
from early childhood he preferred feather boas to football ; pink shoes to playing soccer			2
no problem ; his parents are enlightened , intelligent , educated , urbane and progressive			1
their community in suburban @entity42 was welcoming and inclusive			0
@entity44 : who 's at your @entity47 table ? and yet shortly after he came out of the closet at age 13 , @entity49 attempted suicide			1
in his new book , " @entity55 , " @entity25 's dad takes his readers through his family 's years - long high - wire act : counselors and psychiatrists who tried to medicate their son ; teachers who ranged from saintly to @entity63 - like ; thoughtful , caring professionals who struggled with a kid who did n't quite fit in the " normal " category , but whose peccadilloes and challenges also did n't fit within any of the prefab boxes			1
@entity25 does not have @entity71 's syndrome ; he is not austic ; he 's not @entity72 or @entity73			0
my take : 5 ways to raise thankful children a national reporter for the @entity79 , @entity23 mixes his family 's personal journey with solid reporting on controversies like whether we are over-medicating our children , whether gay teens really are more prone to suicide , nature versus nurture and more			1
he writes like the pro he is , but this is not some dispassionate account of the social science of the suburbs			0
this is open - soul surgery without anesthetic			0
i have known and liked @entity23 and @entity24 since college			0
they are smart and strong and loving			1
they need all of those attributes as they butt heads with educrats , shrinks and teachers as they fight for their bright , witty handful of a boy			0
somehow -- maybe it 's the journalistic training -- @entity23 is not harshly judgmental , even to mr. @entity107 , a teacher who , he says , was especially harmful to @entity25			0
the only time his sense of fairness and perspective abandons him is when he turns his truth - beam on himself : why did n't he act on the warning signs that were obvious in hindsight ? because , of course , they were not obvious then , camouflaged by routine and shrouded in fog			0
every parent feels that way			0
few can express it as fearlessly as @entity23			0
" @entity55 " has a happy ending			0
@entity25 himself provides a coda that will bring tears to your eyes			0
@entity23 's memoir is brave and beautiful , surprising and inspiring , a testament to parents ' endless determination to help their children , and the bottomless capacity for love			1
it is by no means a how - to guide for raising a gay kid			1
it should be taken to heart by every parent			0
living : navigating family and dinner table etiquette landmines as @entity23 writes , " you do n't have to be gay to understand that your own child might feel isolated , different			1
it 's our job to love our little @entity149 whatever it is that makes them different			1
" as families gather for @entity47 , secrets and regrets are invariably on the menu			1
but so is love and acceptance -- especially in the best families , like the @entity160			1
sure @entity163 will bloviate about his golf game , @entity165 will make catty comments about your weight , the cousins from @entity162 will be over-served			0
but i for one will thank @entity171 for family : the folks who fight for you when you 're vulnerable , forgive you when you 're wrong , and always , always love you -- even if you 're a little squirrelly			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			1

@entity177 says his friends have a terrific son , @entity49 ; strong , intelligent , sensitive and also gay
this was no problem to his smart , loving parents ; but at 13 , @entity49 tried to kill himself , he says
he says the dad wrote a book about helping @entity49 through *difficulties* as he came out
@entity190 : it offers a good *reminder* at @entity47 , as families share love and acceptance
