-- diplomacy is never easy			0
top diplomats of @entity3 , the @entity4 and other permanent members of the @entity6 , plus @entity7 , spent three days debating a first , interim deal on @entity3 's nuclear program			1
and an agreement was found : after 34 years of estrangement , @entity3 and the @entity4 were finally on the same page			2
still , the deal fell through			0
@entity15 foreign minister @entity14 showed up in @entity16 , @entity17 , a day into the talks and adopted a hawkish line that guaranteed the failure of the discussions			0
and much to the dismay of the other diplomats involved , @entity14 broke protocol and announced both details of the talks and the failure to reach a deal before @entity4 secretary of state @entity29 had a chance to address the media			0
@entity14 , echoing the objections of hard - line @entity34 prime minister @entity33 , argued that @entity3 would get too much in the proposed deal			1
but in reality @entity3 was only offered modest sanctions relief in return for some significant suspension of aspects of its nuclear program			1
here 's why the deal the @entity4 negotiated , and @entity15 scuttled , would have been good for @entity4			1
@entity3 would not get a nuclear weapon the most important aspect of the agreement with @entity3 that @entity4 president @entity46 is pursuing is that @entity47 would not be able to build a nuclear weapon			2
if @entity47 tries to cheat , it would be caught very early in that process and face consequences			0
by limiting @entity3 's nuclear enrichment activities to below 5 % enrichment , combined with the most intrusive inspections that exist -- the @entity56 to the @entity57 -- the deal means @entity3 could not amass the material to build a nuclear bomb			2
in short , @entity46 would achieve @entity4 's main national security objective			0
this would be a good deal for @entity34 even though @entity33 would never say it publicly , he knows very well that this would be a good deal for @entity34 -- not only because it would prevent @entity3 from building a nuclear bomb , but because improved @entity4 - @entity3 relations inevitably would lead to a softening of @entity3 's position on @entity34			1
this has already happened since @entity3 president @entity73 was elected			0
when @entity3 's strategic interest has dictated such a position on @entity34 , it has pursued that path in spite of its ideological inclinations to challenge @entity34			2
do n't take it from me , take it from the former head of @entity34 's intelligence services , @entity83 : " if the dynamism that leads to a resolution of the nuclear issue , leads to a thaw between @entity3 and the @entity4 , it 's very difficult for the @entity3 to envisage an ' @entity90 ' at the same time they pursue a confrontation with @entity34			1
it would be good for human rights and democracy in @entity3 human rights defenders and pro-democracy activists in @entity3 have for years testified that tensions between @entity3 and @entity4 -- with the risk of war and devastating economic sanctions -- have made their work all the more difficult			1
the situation created an @entity3 with military - security forces in charge			0
everything was seen through the prism of a potential war with the @entity4			0
political freedom and human rights became lesser priorities for @entity3 when the primary concerns were to survive the economic malaise and avoid war			1
democracy simply does not flourish under the threat of war or under the burden of economic collapse			0
with the reduction of tensions as a result of this deal , the opportunity would rise once more for the defenders of democracy and human rights to push @entity3 's political system toward greater freedom			1
the destructive escalation train would be stopped for the first time since 2005 , key elements of the @entity3 nuclear program would be frozen			1
this would be a significant achievement : although the @entity135 has for years escalated its sanctions and put great pressure on the @entity3 economy , @entity3 has at the same time expanded its nuclear program , inching closer toward a nuclear weapons capability -- a mutual escalation , with no solution in sight			1
@entity46 's deal with @entity3 would put a stop to that			2
negotiations could proceed without the nuclear program progressing at the same time			2
it would advance the fight against @entity152 in spite of their enmity , some issues have found @entity3 and the @entity4 on the same side , perhaps nowhere more than in the struggle against @entity152			1
@entity3 has been targeted by @entity152 's terrorism for decades			2
it is often said that the @entity160 extremists in @entity152 hate the @entity161 in @entity3 more than the infidels in @entity4			1
yet the hostility between @entity3 and the @entity4 has prevented them from collaborating against this common threat to the extent that they could and should			2
by opening the path to improved relations between the two states through the nuclear deal , they could claim common cause against this global threat and help stabilize the region			0
there would be peace , not war last but not least , not only would @entity46 's deal prevent a nuclear - armed @entity3 , it would also prevent a devastating war with @entity3			1
make no mistake : although the @entity4 military can handle another war , the @entity4 economy can not absorb its cost			0
without this deal , a military confrontation would become all but certain and the @entity4 people would have to kiss the economic recovery goodbye			0
the @entity4 people who fought tooth and nail against a limited war with @entity193 would have to settle for a war with @entity3 that could well be far more devastating			1
thanks to @entity46 's diplomacy , this nightmare scenario could be prevented			0

trita parsi : @entity15 scuttled a good @entity3 - @entity4 deal negotiated by the @entity4 , accepted by others
he says deal offered @entity3 modest sanctions relief for big overhaul of its nuclear program
@entity203 : it was a good deal for the @entity4 , for @entity34 , for human rights in @entity3 , to fight @entity152
@entity203 : deal would stop inevitable escalating march to a devastating war with @entity3
