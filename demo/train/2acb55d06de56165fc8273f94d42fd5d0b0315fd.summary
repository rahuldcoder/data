august in @entity0 kicked off with an ammo depot blast killing 40 people , followed by news that @entity5 inspectors were probing claims that regime forces had used chemical weapons			1
on monday , @entity5 inspectors were reportedly fired on by snipers while driving to investigate a new alleged chemical attack , one that has the @entity12 moving warships closer to @entity0 and mulling military intervention			2
yet to hear president @entity18 's @entity17 account tell the story , it 's been all about feeding the hungry , science olympiads and widespread support for @entity18 and his wife			1
there are no ugly images of bloody battlefields in the brutal civil war			0
instead , it 's photo after photo of him and his wife being caring -- and lots of pictures of him being mobbed , greeted and hugged by adoring masses			0
the only mention of the war that has dominated headlines outside of @entity0 -- and has killed , according to @entity5 estimates , more than 100,000 of @entity18 's countrymen -- comes in the captions beneath photos of the president shaking hands with soldiers " protecting civilians " and " regaining security and stability " in @entity48			1
the soldiers appear at ease and enthusiastic about @entity18 's visit , rather than in a state of war			2
the following day , the account featured file images of " captain " @entity18 building camps and moving beds with his " comrades " in @entity0 in 1994 , about six years before he took the country 's helm from his father			1
the rest of the month , according to the account , has been packed with diplomatic functions , awards ceremonies , and his wife , @entity66 , tossing salad , stirring pots and filling bowls as @entity71 broke fast in the evenings of the @entity74 holy month			0
some of the president 's almost 34,000 @entity17 followers seem to sense spin in the postings , with one asking of the notoriously fashion - conscious first lady , " so she managed to find time to stop shopping for shoes ? " and another demanding photos of her @entity82 , the brand of posh , @entity85 shoes that can command upward of $ 1,000 a pair			1
almost as common as the comments asserting , " what a load of bs this account is " are followers offering warm wishes of " @entity93 bless you , " " we love you " and " we want you to win this war			2
" some supporters have even employed a " @entity102 " hashtag			0
the embattled president announced he was adding @entity17 to his social media blitz last month via a message posted to his @entity107 account			1
he began posting photos july 24			0
he also has his own @entity110 page and a @entity112 channel .			0

@entity0 president 's @entity17 account filled with photos of him , first lady being caring
*absent* are images of war , though some postings show him meeting *relaxed* soldiers
