-- as a reality tv fiend , i assumed that " top chef : @entity5 " was going to be totally vanilla			1
oh , how wrong i was			1
throughout the season , pastry chef @entity6 has had some serious drama with assorted meltdowns and crocodile tears brought on by such tragedies as the fact that there were no more grapefruits in the kitchen			1
but this week 's episode was beyond			1
@entity6 got so worked up after being told he could n't make ice cream from scratch during a " @entity21 " challenge that he had a full - blown panic attack , saying he was leaving and screaming at the producers			1
he was carted off in an ambulance			1
and so , he was forced to drop out of the competition			1
but he was n't the only one to go this week			1
contestant @entity25 also decided to go home voluntarily , interrupting a judge to say , " i would , perhaps , like to ask to be eliminated today			1
" over the years , many people have quit reality tv shows in the middle of shooting			1

i just found out that i have to choose between staying here and going back to work			1
" after a discussion and a bunch of tears , @entity38 decided to leave the show			2
it was the first time on " @entity39 " where a rose ceremony was n't necessary			2
@entity57 said " no thanks " to " @entity59 " a season later , @entity60 closed the karmic loop			2
he was one of @entity38 's three finalists on " @entity59 , " but realized he still had feelings for an ex-girlfriend , @entity64			2
he dumped @entity38 in @entity65 and left the show			1
i thought for a second maybe he was pulling an @entity70 -- by leaving the show and coming back , you can virtually guarantee a dating show win -- but , alas , he never looked back			2
the @entity0 : 10 stars with bad body habits 3			2
" @entity76 " escaped the jungle @entity77 and @entity78 left " @entity79 " three times			1
first , they had a freak - out when they learned they 'd have to take a turn cleaning their group 's @entity86			2
@entity78 said , " i 'm too rich and i 'm too famous to be sitting with these people and cleaning up their s * * t in the jungle , my man			1
and this cast is devaluing our fame right now			2
i 'm sitting next to @entity98 comedians that i have never even seen before ... i thought it was gon na be all celebrities			2
" they returned the next morning , when @entity78 freaked out again			1
they returned once again but when @entity77 got a stomach illness , they finally left for good			1
model was scared off by scissors every season of " @entity105 , " there 's a girl who is horrified when her hair is cut off during makeovers			1

@entity127 left @entity128 @entity129 left " @entity129 " because she was over having to interact with @entity130			1
" i would say 99.9 percent is because of @entity130 , but the other .1 percent was drama created by her , " @entity129 explained			2
guess she was scared that @entity130 was actually going to make a skin suit out of her ? 6			2
@entity133 skipped the finals @entity137 through season four of " @entity133 , " fans voted @entity138 right behind @entity139 as their favorite to win			2

she explained , " at the time i 'd just graduated from school			0
i want to work for other designers			0
i want to maybe get my master 's			0
