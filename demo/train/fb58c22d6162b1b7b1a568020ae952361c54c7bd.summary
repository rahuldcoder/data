it began for @entity1 as a question : what would @entity3 look like if she had the dimensions of an average woman ? his answer came in the form of the @entity12 doll : a shorter , broader , brunette version of the idealistic blond @entity15 doll			1
now @entity12 is ready to make her debut , complete with a sticker pack that features pimples , moles , cellulite and scars that can be applied			1
" i feel she looks so real , so ordinary , that you do n't focus on what she looks like but ... on what she does , " he said by telephone on wednesday			0
that perspective helped propel @entity1 's crowd - funding effort to build the doll			1
the 26 - year - old toy maker said the dolls will be mailed to his crowd - funding backers no later than @entity35 , the traditional kickoff for holiday shopping			1
thousands more , which were preordered , will also be shipped before the holidays , he said			0
here 's what you need to know about @entity1 and the doll : germ of an idea it began in 2013 , when @entity1 began playing with the idea of what @entity3 would look like as an average woman			1
but what were those dimensions ? he got the answer from the @entity55			1
( for the record , the @entity55 says the average @entity58 woman weighs 166.2 pounds and has a 37.5 inch waist			1
) the initial version of the doll was an art project of sorts , with @entity1 creating a model of the average woman and doing a side - by - side comparison with @entity3			1
the response to the project was overwhelming , with even actress and singer @entity68 taking to @entity70 to call @entity1 's doll " awesome			1
" the response in turn prompted @entity1 's crowd - funding effort to create the doll			1
he raised nearly $ 100,000 in a single day , and within 30 days he had raised more than $ 500,000			0
average is beautiful the doll , with its wide hips , thick legs and rounded rump , goes against the concept of the perfect figure			2
" the message i want to send is that it 's not what you look like			2
that does n't define you			0
what you do does , " he said			0
@entity1 said he took inspiration for the doll from his own experience in high school , which he described as the " worst time in my life			1
" " i really cared about how i looked , and i did n't feel good about myself , " he said			0
acne and a clothing line billed as @entity98 , the $ 5.99 accessory pack will be on sale in january			0
the idea , @entity1 said , is two-fold : realism and innovation			0
people have acne , tattoos , moles and scars , he said			0
while realism is an issue , @entity1 said to grow the fledgling company there also has to be innovation			0
" you have to be one step ahead , " he said			0
part of the step also includes launching a doll clothing line , dubbed @entity12 's @entity117			1
down the road , @entity1 said he plans to release a boy doll			2
eventually , he said he would like to follow the @entity121 model , where children could design their own @entity12 dolls with custom features			1
what 's in a name ? the doll is not named lammily			2
rather , @entity1 said , that 's the name of the company			2
" with the name , i combined by my @entity1 and family , " he said			0
a number of his family members have played a role in helping him develop the doll , including creating the box and the stickers			2
so , what 's the doll 's name ? whatever you want it to be , @entity1 said			1
the dolls come with a numbered passport that allows you to name the doll			2
@entity1 said the company website will eventually include a database where people can register the name of their doll			0
what does @entity15 have to say ? nothing at the moment			0
@entity15 did not return a telephone call from @entity157 seeking comment about the doll .			0

the @entity12 doll is the *antithesis* of @entity3
the doll 's proportions are based on @entity55 data , the toy maker says
creator says he took inspiration from his own high school experience
