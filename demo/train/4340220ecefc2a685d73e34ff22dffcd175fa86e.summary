-- " there is a great deal of sadness , but it 's really celebratory , " @entity5 bassist @entity4 says , describing his conflicting emotions the day after he , guitarist @entity7 and singer @entity8 announced they were disbanding after 31 years together			1
" there is sadness because i will never play on the same stage as @entity7 and @entity8 again			2
" yet , @entity14 insists , " we 're doing this for good reasons , and we end up looking back at all the fun , the joy and the incredible opportunities we had			1
" so why is @entity22 's biggest alternative - rock band breaking up now ? " it 's not because we have to or we ca n't stand each other or we suck , " @entity14 contends			1
" @entity14 , @entity7 and @entity8 issued the news of their split without warning on september 21st , in a statement posted on @entity5 's website			1
" a wise man once said , ' the skill in attending a party is knowing when it 's time to leave , ' " @entity8 wrote			2
" we built something extraordinary together			2
. now we 're going to walk away from it			2
" " it was very unexpected , " says @entity36 , the chairman of @entity37 , the band 's label			2
he found out " the same morning that the press release went on their website , " in a phone call from @entity5 manager @entity42			1
" i ca n't believe they 're breaking up , but i understand , " @entity36 says			2
" they 're too pure , too respectful of their own thing			2
" @entity5 actually made their decision a few months ago , before they met in @entity51 , @entity52 , this summer to record three new songs for a two - @entity55 greatest - hits package , " @entity5 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 " 1982 - 2011 , out november 15th			1
the band delayed the announcement because " a lot of people are affected by this decision in a serious way , " @entity14 says , referring to @entity5 's staff and crew			1
" we wanted everything set up the way it should be			2
" and we were excited to find three really good songs to put out as a farewell , " he adds			2
two of the new tracks , " @entity76 " and " a month of saturdays , " came from demos for @entity5 's last studio album , " @entity79 , " released in march			1
the third song , a @entity82 - flavored treat with sunshine - pop brass , is called , aptly , " @entity84			0
" it comes out as a single october 18th			0
@entity14 ca n't remember when he , @entity7 and @entity8 began seriously talking about the end of the band			1
" but it was discussed on the 2008 tour , " he says , and during the sessions for @entity79			0
the group was coming to the end of its @entity37 deal and chose not to tour behind that record			0
there are " indications " on the album , @entity14 notes , citing @entity8 's " lyrical content " in " @entity100			1
" " there are some straightforward see - you - laters on that one			0
" it might have been talked about in more general terms before that , " @entity14 suggests			1
" we 'd say things like , ' we have @entity109 number of records in the contract			0
by the time we finish , we 'll be @entity109 number of years old			0
do we still want to be out there flogging it ? ' " ironically , @entity5 's disappointing 2004 album , " @entity116 , " made @entity14 , @entity8 and @entity7 determined to stick around long enough to redeem themselves			1
" we needed to prove , not only to our fans and critics but to ourselves , that we could still make great records , " @entity14 says , " and we made two " -- accelerate , released in 2008 , and @entity79			1
" we thought , ' we 've done it			0
now let 's do something no other band has done : shake hands and walk away as friends			0
' " @entity5 formed in @entity51 in 1980 with drummer @entity127 and issued their debut single , " @entity129 , " in july 1981			1
through heavy touring , growing airplay and a stunning creative evolution -- from the jangling enigma of 1983 's @entity133 to the complex and commercial dynamics of @entity136 and 1991 's @entity137 -- @entity5 became @entity22 rock 's biggest grass - roots - success story			1
the day after @entity5 broke up , @entity36 was on the phone with @entity143 's @entity142 : " @entity142 said @entity5 were the first underground band he saw that conquered the mainstream			1
he was 13 years old , and it changed his perception of what rock could be			0
" @entity127 quit in 1997 , after suffering a brain aneurysm on tour two years earlier			0
the others continued while doing side projects , which they will now pursue full - time			0
@entity8 is a film producer and active in visual arts			0
@entity7 has a long discography as a sideman for cult heroes such as @entity159 and the @entity160			0
@entity5 's 15 studio albums have sold more than 85 million copies worldwide , and the band was inducted into the @entity164 in 2007			1
but @entity14 says @entity5 's greatest accomplishment was that " we conducted ourselves with as much integrity as possible			1
we showed people you can conduct your operation on your own terms and be successful			0
" in fact , " he adds , " you 'll have a much better time and sleep better at night			0
