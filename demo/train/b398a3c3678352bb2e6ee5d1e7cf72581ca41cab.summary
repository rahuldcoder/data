@entity0 , @entity1 -- vandals burned a mosque in the @entity1 on friday in an attack a @entity7 official said reflected @entity9 settler rage over a government moratorium on settlement construction			1
no one knows who set ablaze and vandalized the mosque -- located in the @entity1 village of @entity0			1
but the governor of @entity18 district , @entity16 , told @entity2 he believes @entity20 settlers were responsible for the attack			1
" the mosque was completely burned , " @entity16 said			0
" they burned the praying carpets and @entity26 holy books , and set the mosque completely on fire , they even burned the loudspeakers where the @entity30 preaches inside the mosque			0
" @entity32 said the culprits had scrawled @entity35 graffiti at the entrance of the mosque that read " price tag -- with regards from @entity40			0
" " price tag " is the expression radical @entity9 settlers have used to denote reprisal attacks against @entity7 in response to moves by the @entity9 government to evacuate illegal @entity1 outposts			2
@entity9 's defense minister @entity49 called on the @entity9 military , which occupies the @entity1 , to find those responsible for the attack			1
" this is an extremist action that is meant to harm any effort by the government to advance political processes for @entity9 's future , " @entity49 said in a statement released by his office			2
settler leader @entity60 -- chairman of the @entity61 , a group of @entity20 municipal councils from the @entity1 -- told @entity2 , " i hope that @entity9 police will uncover the perpetrators whoever they are and will bring them to trial			2
this act is wrong and foolish			0
if this act was carried out by a jew it fills me with great shame			0
" @entity32 said later friday morning , after word of the mosque attack had spread , residents of the village were prevented by the @entity9 army from approaching the area which resulted in minor clashes with exchanges of rocks and tear gas between the residents and @entity9 soldiers			1
@entity32 expressed doubt that the attack would be investigated properly			0
" what do the police and @entity9 army do when they attack our holy mosques and houses ? what do they do to the settlers ? but when they attack us they do nothing			2
" last month , @entity9 prime minister @entity97 announced a 10 - month freeze on new settlement construction in the occupied @entity1			1
the move has been met with fierce opposition by the politically powerful settler movement and confrontations have erupted almost daily in the @entity1 , with groups of settlers forcibly attempting to keep away government inspectors enforcing the ban .			0
