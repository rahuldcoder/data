@entity0 -- the @entity3 expects the level of violence in @entity6 to rise as it goes ahead with its planned withdrawal of troops from @entity6 cities by june 30 , the @entity2 said wednesday			1
except for soldiers in advisory roles , all @entity3 combat troops will leave @entity6 cities and towns by june 30			1
under the terms of its agreement with the @entity6 government , the @entity3 will remove all combat troops from @entity6 cities and towns -- leaving security responsibilities to the @entity6 and remaining only in a training and advisory capacity			1
in areas outside of the cities and towns , the @entity3 military will continue to conduct combat operations and security patrols in coordination with the @entity6			1
violent attacks are at an " all - time " low according to @entity2 spokesman @entity30 , but there continue to be sporadic high - profile attacks by insurgents , including a blast that killed 62 people and injured 150 others at a @entity38 market on wednesday			1
such a spike in violence is to be expected , @entity30 told reporters wednesday , " based upon the pattern of behavior that we 've seen over the past few weeks , and , frankly , historically in @entity6 , leading up to seminal dates , whether it be elections or other significant dates , of an uptick in the operational tempo of terrorists and insurgents			0
" in a letter to @entity3 troops , the top @entity3 commander insisted the withdrawal was appropriate			2
" this is the right time to transition security of the cities to the @entity61 [ @entity62 ] who are ready for this task , " gen. @entity57 wrote on june 21			2
while the @entity3 has seen progress , it is not ready to declare victory in @entity6 and @entity30 suggested such a declaration may never happen			0
" i do n't think anybody 's too preoccupied with declaring victory			0
i do n't think that was necessarily something we 'll ever do , " @entity30 said at a news conference at the @entity2			0
the notion of declaring victory is controversial since former president @entity77 's declaration in may 2003 that major combat operations in @entity6 were over while he was standing under a sign reading " @entity79			0
" the pronouncement was premature , with violence and deaths of @entity3 troops and @entity6 civilians escalating in the years that followed .			0

as agreed upon , @entity3 will remove all combat troops from @entity6 cities and towns
with @entity6 violence at " all - time " low , @entity2 expects " uptick " after june 30
