@entity0 -- fearlessly demonstrating the majesty of @entity4 justice or acquiescing to terrorists by giving them undeserved rights and a public platform ? the decision to bring @entity9 , admitted mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , and four other suspects to a @entity14 courtroom , rather than a military tribunal , was described in stark contrasts sunday by officials on opposing sides of the political spectrum			1
@entity20 hailed attorney general @entity22 's decision to try the men in a civilian court as a demonstration of @entity4 's might and moral certainty , while @entity28 called it a bad idea based on politics rather than pragmatism			1

" " i do n't think we should run and hide and cower			0
let 's use our system			2
" but @entity42 sen. @entity42 of @entity43 , speaking on the @entity1 program " @entity45 , " questioned why foreigners who allegedly are terrorists at war with the @entity4 should be given full judicial rights of @entity4 citizens			1
" these people are evil people , " @entity42 said of the defendants			0

" former @entity14 major @entity63 , considered a possible @entity28 presidential candidate in 2012 , called military tribunals created for terrorism suspects who have been held at @entity68 , @entity69 , a better option than a civilian court			1
military tribunals are " a better choice for the government , " @entity63 said on " @entity74			1
" " this choice of @entity14 is a better choice for the terrorists			0
why would you seek to give the terrorists a better choice than you 're giving the public ? " in a separate interview on @entity1 's " @entity45 , " @entity63 said a @entity14 court trial would cause unnecessary stress and expense for the city 's police force			1
" anyone that tells you that this does n't create additional security problems , of course , is n't telling you the truth , " @entity63 said			2
" and the best indication of it is , just look at the additional security that 's going to be employed when this happens			0
that also happens to cost millions and millions and millions of dollars			0
" rep. @entity98 of @entity99 , the ranking @entity28 on the @entity100 , warned that bringing the suspects to @entity14 raised the risk of further attacks on the @entity4			1

however , @entity20 sen. @entity109 of @entity110 said on " @entity74 " that scores of terrorism suspects were successfully prosecuted in civilian courts under the @entity114			1
