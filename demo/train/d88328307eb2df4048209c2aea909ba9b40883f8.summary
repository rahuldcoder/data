-- @entity1 pledged wednesday to take steps to reopen the @entity3 , the joint manufacturing complex where it halted the operations of @entity7 companies during a period of high tensions this year			1
the announcement from the @entity1 is its latest move after multiple rounds of talks with the @entity7 , aimed at getting the shuttered factories at @entity3 back up and running , failed to yield a breakthrough last month			1
@entity16 responded to @entity18 's statement wednesday by agreeing to fresh negotiations on the complex next week			2
@entity1 's decision in april to suspend activity at the industrial zone , a key symbol of @entity25 cooperation , for the first time in its nine - year history surprised many observers			1
with 53,000 @entity1 working at more than 120 @entity7 companies , @entity3 was considered to be an important source of hard currency for @entity33 's regime			1
but for about four months , the zone , which sits on the @entity1 's side of the demilitarized zone that separates the two @entity37 , has lain dormant			0
in its statement wednesday carried by state media , @entity1 said it would allow @entity7 companies to return to the manufacturing complex			1
@entity18 began preventing @entity7 from entering the zone in april at a time when it was unleashing a torrent of threatening rhetoric toward @entity7 and the @entity46			2
the tensions have since eased , and the generally secretive @entity1 recently allowed a large western media contingent , including @entity0 journalists , to cover the 60th anniversary of the armistice that stopped the @entity52 in 1953			0
the @entity53 also said wednesday that it would ensure " the normal attendance of its workers " at the @entity7 companies ' factories , as well as guaranteeing the safety of @entity7 personnel in the zone			2
the @entity1 statement said that if @entity7 responded to its " bold and magnanimous stand , " it would hold another round of talks next week on returning operations at the zone to normal			1
" we are looking forward to reaching an appropriate measure for resolving the @entity3 issue , " the @entity66 said in a statement accepting the offer of talks			0
on sunday , the @entity7 suggested that time for finding a solution on @entity3 might be running out			0
" the patience of our people , who wish to see @entity1 's sincere attitude , is reaching its limit , and @entity1 should bear that in mind , " said @entity77 , a @entity66 spokesman			0
the @entity7 government has been working on measures to compensate the companies hurt by the shuttering of the industrial zone			2
on wednesday , before the @entity1 announcement , the @entity84 's @entity66 said it had authorized the equivalent of about $ 250 million in insurance payments to firms with activities linked to the zone			0
@entity0 's @entity91 contributed to this report .			0
