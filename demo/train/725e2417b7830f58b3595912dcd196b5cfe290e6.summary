" i was stunned , " he told @entity1 during a visit to his hometown of @entity33 , @entity34			0
during the @entity37 , @entity36 troops were n't supposed to be in neutral @entity5 , so @entity3 and a handful of colleagues shed their uniforms and posed as civilians to run a top secret radar installation high on a @entity5 cliff			1
called @entity45 85 , it guided @entity36 bombers to sites in @entity12 and parts of @entity5 under communist control			1

" he ( @entity3 ) was the only one that did n't get injured in the firefight , " @entity76 recalled			1
