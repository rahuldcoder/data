-- the @entity2 relationship with president @entity4 's @entity3 is full of contradictions and tensions , according to recently published @entity2 diplomatic cables , but is also underpinned by similar basic interests in a rough and unpredictable part of the world			1
a @entity0 analysis of secret and confidential cables published by @entity13 and its media partners reveals @entity2 frustration with @entity4 's lack of succession planning , concerns over stuttering economic reform and private criticism of the @entity4 government 's hard line toward domestic opponents			1
but the cables also show that @entity25 sees @entity3 as an important and -- until now -- stable ally on issues , including @entity29 's nuclear program , promoting negotiations between @entity31 and the @entity32 and making life difficult for @entity34 in @entity35			1
and above all , @entity3 is regarded as a moderate bulwark against @entity29 - sponsored @entity38 fundamentalism			0
the cables show that @entity4 has taken a persistently hard line toward @entity29 , telling @entity2 diplomats in 2008 that he had warned @entity42 " not to provoke the @entity2 " on the nuclear issue and insisting @entity3 could never accept a nuclear - armed @entity29			1
@entity4 has also repeatedly warned of @entity29 's influence with @entity34 in @entity35 and @entity45 in @entity46 , and in a cable from february last year , was quoted as describing " @entity42 's hand moving with ease throughout the region , from the @entity51 to @entity52			2
" a 2009 cable noted that with " the discovery of a @entity45 cell in @entity3 , the @entity3 appear more willing to confront the @entity29 surrogates and to work closely with @entity31			0
" to that end , the cables describe the @entity4 government as a helpful partner in stopping smuggling into @entity35 from @entity3			1
a cable from 2008 quoted a senior @entity3 military figure as stating that @entity3 had spent approximately $ 40 million to purchase the steel for an underground wall on the @entity35 border , " and @entity3 was paying the cost of this wall in terms of public opinion both within @entity3 and the region			0
" there is no guarantee that any " successor " to the @entity4 government would take such a hard line with @entity34			0
for the @entity2 , the alliance between @entity3 and @entity77 has also been an important counterweight to growing @entity29 influence on the " @entity83 " and among states such as @entity81 and @entity82			1
@entity3 officials , from @entity4 down , have also repeatedly impressed upon visiting @entity2 -- military , diplomatic and @entity86 -- that it alone among @entity83 states can play a mediating role between @entity31 and the @entity90			1
[ @entity3 signed a peace treaty with @entity31 in 1979 , and @entity4 has resisted popular opposition to it			1
] ahead of @entity4 's visit to @entity25 in may 2009 , ambassador @entity93 wrote from @entity95 that " the @entity3 want the visit to demonstrate that @entity3 remains @entity2 's indispensable " @entity83 ally			1
" @entity93 continued that @entity4 was " a tried and true realist , innately cautious and conservative , and has little time for idealistic goals			0
" he viewed himself as " someone who is tough but fair , who ensures the basic needs of his people			0
" at the same time , the @entity4 government has been very sensitive to any perceived slight from @entity25			1
it has complained about cuts in @entity2 economic aid and a stagnant level of military aid " because it shows our diminished view of the value of our relationship " according to one cable			2
on pressure to improve human rights , according to one cable from @entity93 in 2009 , " @entity4 takes this issue personally , and it makes him seethe when we raise it , particularly in public			0
" in a later cable , she said that @entity4 " harkens back to the @entity122 : the @entity2 encouraged him to accept reforms , only to watch the country fall into the hands of revolutionary religious extremists			2
" the @entity3 president relied on his interior minister and intelligence service to " keep the domestic beasts at bay , and @entity4 is not one to lose sleep over their tactics			2
" the @entity2 cables display frustration with @entity4 's reluctance to address human rights issues , with one in 2008 saying : " while @entity3 has made some limited gains over the last several years , such as on @entity141 , progress overall has been slow			1
" in a later cable , @entity93 suggested the new @entity2 secretary of state , @entity148 " may wish to lay down a marker for a future discussion on democratization and human rights concerns			2
" but given @entity4 's sensitivities , the @entity2 has trodden carefully in pressing the @entity3 government on human rights			1
a cable from 2009 said the @entity2 now avoided " the public confrontations that had become routine over the past several years " over human rights			0
over the past five years , the cables reveal a growing unease with the lack of a succession plan , and apprehension about the prospect of @entity4 's younger son , @entity161 , taking over from his father			1
as far back as april 2006 , one cable observed that @entity4 's wife , @entity164 , was their son 's " most ardent booster " but added : " the possibility that @entity161 might succeed his father remains deeply unpopular on the street			1
" it adds that " unlike his father , ( @entity161 ) can not take the military 's support for granted , " having never served as an officer			0
but the same cable laments the lack of obvious contenders to succeed the aging @entity4 -- a situation that appears to hold today			2
@entity93 wrote in apparent frustration two years ago that @entity4 " seems to be trusting to @entity180 and the ubiquitous military and civilian security services to ensure an orderly transition			0
" recent events may have eroded that confidence , but one cable in 2007 pointed out that @entity3 's internal security apparatus , " an estimated 1.4 million strong , is at least twice the size it was under @entity189 ... and makes any kind of violent change of leader unlikely			0
" that perspective is now being challenged -- and the role of the military may be critical in deciding the outcome			0
a cable from 2008 cites @entity3 experts as describing a " disgruntled mid-level officer corps " with military salaries falling far behind the civilian sector and the top brass averse to @entity161 succeeding his father			0
@entity3 commentators also noted that many officers were frustrated that loyalty to the regime trumped competence , and that the best military talent was sidelined in case it should pose a threat to the government			0
even so , one cable concludes : " the military still remains a potent political and economic force			0
" after discussing whether the military might step in to prevent @entity4 from passing the baton to his son , the cable concludes : " in a messier succession scenario , however , it becomes more difficult to predict the military 's actions			2
