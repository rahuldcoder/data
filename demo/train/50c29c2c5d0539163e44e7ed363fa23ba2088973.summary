-- i do n't like feeling stuck in a particular operating system , social network or piece of software			0
it 's not that i wo n't commit to a product or company -- it 's that i do n't trust any of them enough to get married to one of them			0
once they own me , they 'll start either selling my data to other companies , limiting my web experiences to the ones that help sell their clients ' products or otherwise screwing with me as a consumer and person			0
and while i have little faith that consumer protection or privacy advocates can protect my interests against the corporate behemoths , i am beginning to take heart in the way the battles between corporations over their rights to compete have the perhaps unintended side effect of keeping me from having to commit to any one of them			0
today , it 's @entity35 in the cross hairs			1
@entity39 on in part by those left lying in the wake of @entity35 's rise to web search dominance , the @entity37 and @entity38 are challenging the company 's monopoly and how they are leveraging it			1
if the story feels familiar , that 's because it is			2
fourteen years ago , it was @entity49 getting slapped for anticompetitive behavior			1
the company 's dominance in the operating system market appeared so great , so irreversible , that it was deemed a monopoly			2
for @entity55 to bundle the explorer browser along with his operating system -- and to do so in such a way that leveraged this advantage and quashed competition -- was judged illegal and prohibited			0
now it 's @entity35 's turn for scrutiny			1
this time , alarm bells first went off when people began to realize that all that photography @entity35 had been doing for its @entity68 maps services was n't just photography			1
as long as @entity35 was driving through neighborhoods taking video of every store and house , it might as well do some @entity76 monitoring and see who was online			2
the @entity78 , in particular , got irked by this move , but then so did everyone else			0
this opened the door to bigger charges though -- most significantly that @entity35 's search algorithms are rigged to promote @entity35 's own services while putting those of competitors lower in the list of results			1
if @entity35 indeed has a monopoly on search -- about 70 % of the @entity93 market and almost 95 % of @entity94 's -- then it does have a duty to watch out for the players in other markets where @entity35 is competing			1
that 's why , at least as far as pure search terms and equivalent but ranked results , @entity35 's critics may have a point			1
if a @entity35 company or partner gets higher on the list simply because it 's good for @entity35 , then there 's a bit of explaining to do			1
but what about when search results contain more than simple lists , but come to include little built - in utilities ? for instance , if you 're doing a search for " plane tickets from @entity115 to @entity116 , " your list of results will begin with a handy @entity35 flight finding application , built right into the page , complete with space for your desired dates of travel and a submit button			2
below that , you get regular old links to @entity129 and @entity130 and all the other online travel agencies			0
these are not equivalent results			0
the @entity35 flight utility is n't just a text link but an interactive tool that imitates the very functionality of @entity129 or @entity130			2
( once you pick your flights , it sends you to the relevant airline site with all your data already filled in			0
) in one sense , @entity35 has made its users ' lives easier by pulling travel functionality right into its search engine			2
in another sense , though , @entity35 has replicated the functionality of the online travel agencies and then used its search monopoly to give itself an advantage			1
for , at least in theory , all the other online ticketing services could be building their own mini-apps to sit right alongside @entity35 's			1
but they 're not really being invited to do so , and if they did , would they be surrendering even more to @entity35 ? if an antitrust suit pushed @entity35 to give other companies the same abilities that @entity35 has , we could end up on a path to more functionality for everyone			2
if it simply forces @entity35 to yank all kinds of utility from the search engine -- or to crowd a formerly streamlined lists of links with a convoluted mix of links , windows , apps and utilities , then the search itself may become a thing of the past			1
( a what ? exactly			0
) technological evolution occurs in fits and starts , and sometimes cutting back growth really just helps the rest of the tree grow fuller and healthier			0
when @entity188 can patent the very gestures we use to access data or move windows on a cell phone , or @entity194 can become the default phonebook for the world , it puts their individual dominions as companies directly at odds with our ability to control what is shared about us , what @entity202 we get to see and our awareness of either one			0
this attack on @entity35 from above ends up protecting some of our interests here down below			1
in the logic of corporate capitalism , the best safeguard against getting trapped in single - provider solutions from @entity194 to the @entity208 is when someone can prove it 's bad for business			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			0

@entity216 : @entity37 , @entity38 challenging @entity35 over monopoly
he says it 's familiar because same thing happened to @entity49 14 years ago
he says charges are @entity35 using search control to push its services over competitors
