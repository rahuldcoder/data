@entity0 , @entity1 -- a man in an @entity1 military uniform killed three @entity6 troops friday in southern @entity1 , the latest in a series of assaults against @entity10 soldiers by @entity1 clad in security force garb			1
the man opened fire on the troops in the volatile @entity15 province , said maj. @entity16 , a spokeswoman for the @entity17			1
@entity16 did not immediately provide details about the attack , one of a handful in recent weeks to target @entity10 troops			0
a @entity24 official said the three troops killed were part of a @entity28 mission to stabilize a village in the @entity31 area			1
they were meeting with local officials			0
@entity10 and @entity1 troops have been searching for the gunman			1
" it is too early to say that this latest incident is part of a stepped - up effort on the insurgents ' part , " @entity35 spokesman @entity34 said			2
" we know they are trying to maximize media exposure of these events but our military believes that the operational impact has been negligible			0
nonetheless these incidents do concern us and our hearts go out to all the victims and their families			0
" in the strikes , known as " green - on - blue " attacks , @entity1 security forces or militants dressed as local police or soldiers target coalition troops			1
the problem has sapped troop morale , and coalition forces have been working to address it			0
earlier this year , gen. @entity63 , commander of the @entity10 - led force , said the systems that @entity1 and coalition forces had put in place to help prevent these attacks were having an effect			1
@entity63 said coalition officials were working on a new procedure to check the backgrounds of @entity1 who sign up for the army or police force , and the @entity1 " have taken a lot of steps themselves			2
" @entity79 , a terrorism analyst , said @entity1 security personnel have killed an estimated 93 @entity82 soldiers since may 2007 , and they have killed 31 this year alone across the country			1

one was the killing of a @entity6 soldier tuesday by two @entity1 wearing army uniforms			1
on thursday , @entity6 troops killed an @entity1 soldier who tried to gun them down at a training center in @entity100			1
" the attack types are about split : about half seem to be @entity104 infiltrators , or @entity106 members who were turned by the @entity104 , " said @entity79			2
remembering the @entity109 crash , a year later " the other half seem to be disgruntled security personnel who have turned on troops for some sort of grievance			1
it is very difficult to know exactly what is happening given that @entity82 does not release a lot of information on these attacks			0
" @entity1 intelligence agents have started going undercover during recruit training to spot signs of extremist tendencies among the newcomers , military officials say			2
" the @entity6 military has become so concerned with the green - on - blue attacks that it has ordered units to designate ' guardian angels ' in each unit whose job is to provide security for troops working with @entity1			1
but the attacks have not abated , " @entity79 said			0
elsewhere in @entity15 , a vehicle struck a roadside mine friday , killing six civilians and wounding five others , president @entity138 's office said			1

the @entity104 claimed responsibility for the attack , saying two bombers targeted the @entity6 soldier near the entrance of the compound of the province council in @entity194 , according to a statement released by spokesman @entity196			2
@entity196 said the attack occurred as the troops were exiting a military vehicle and gathering to enter the compound			0
