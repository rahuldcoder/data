@entity0 -- members of @entity3 returned to @entity0 on monday from a five - week summer break			1
and they already ca n't wait to go back home			0
despite frightening international developments drawing the @entity7 into a major military fight against the terrorist group @entity9 and several unresolved policy disputes on things like immigration , members of the @entity14 and @entity15 come back to the @entity16 with one thing in mind : do the bare minimum and get back on the campaign trail			1
at the top of the must - do list : passing a government funding bill and avoiding another government shutdown			1
federal agencies run out of money at the end of september and the @entity14 could vote as early as this week on a " @entity28 , " or continuing resolution , that keeps current funding levels through mid-december			2
congressional republicans , confident they will regain control of the @entity15 , want to pass the spending bill quickly and without drama			2
privately , some @entity36 relish the idea of more brinkmanship on the issue because of the political damage a shutdown inflicted on @entity32 last fall			2
@entity42 leader @entity42 , who is in a tight re-election battle , told @entity1 's @entity44 recently he would not allow a shutdown to occur			2
" i did rule it out			0
i 'm the guy who gets us out of shutdowns , " he said			0
" that 's a failed policy			0
" leaders may decide to tack on a short - term extension of the @entity54 , the credit agency that gives loans to companies to promote @entity7 exports			0
the bank 's credit authority expires at the end of the month , but many conservatives oppose renewing it , arguing the institution is another example of government doing what the private sector should do			2
@entity67 : why the @entity54 matters another key item in front of @entity3 : whether to vote on authorizing military action against @entity9			1
after demanding a plan from president @entity73 on how he will respond to the terrorist threat , top congressional leaders will head to the @entity14 on tuesday to hear from the president before he outlines his strategy in a national address on wednesday			1
administration officials have been summoned for a series of hearings on @entity81 , but it 's an open question whether there will be an actual vote to grant the president new war authority or provide additional money to arm @entity89 rebels			2
@entity73 : @entity7 to ' go on some offense ' in @entity9 fight asked on @entity94 's " @entity93 " over the weekend , the president signaled that he may not think he any needs sign - off from @entity96			1
" i 'm confident that i 've got the authorization that i need to protect the @entity7 people , " @entity73 said			1
but some on @entity96 said it 's up to the @entity3 , not the president , to give the go - ahead for military action			1
sen. @entity104 of @entity105 , a possible @entity32 presidential contender in 2016 , said " formal congressional authorization is required by the @entity107 and would force the president to commit a clearly defined strategy to protect our national security			2
" @entity1 poll : most @entity7 alarmed by @entity9 senior aides from both political parties said it 's hard to gauge whether a new authorization could pass until they see the administration 's plans			1
already , a number of proposals are being pushed by bipartisan lawmakers , ranging from a narrowly tailored bill that would authorize airstrikes against @entity9 in @entity89 to broader legislation that would give the president congressional approval to go after terrorists around the world			1
the @entity14 is scheduled to be in session for just a dozen more days before the november election , but if the continuing resolution clears both chambers without any problems , it 's likely that @entity3 will head home for the final campaign stretch earlier than planned			1
the brief fall , pre-campaign session will be more about political messaging than legislating			0
the @entity32 - led @entity14 will roll up a laundry list of previously approved jobs bills into one major economic measure , pass it and send it to the @entity36 - led @entity15			2
it will also vote on a nonbinding resolution condemning the @entity73 administration for not consulting @entity3 earlier this year when it traded five @entity146 prisoners for the release of @entity149 sgt. @entity148 , who was held captive in @entity150			1
@entity32 continue to believe complaints about @entity152 resonate with voters , so the @entity14 is scheduled to vote this week on a bill proposed by @entity156 @entity155 that would allow those who like their current health care plans to keep them			0
@entity155 is running for @entity15 against one of the most endangered red state democrats , sen. @entity162			0
any action on the politically tricky issue of immigration reform will be punted until november 's lame duck session			0
@entity73 announced over the weekend that he is delaying any executive action to curb deportations of undocumented workers until after the midterms , a move house speaker @entity168 said " smacks of raw politics			1
" but the president is expected to announce a new policy before the end of the year and congressional republicans will certainly fight back and try to block it			1
in the @entity15 , the first noteworthy vote of the shortened session wo n't have anything to do with keeping the government funded or defeating @entity9			1
instead , the monday evening vote will be on whether to take up a @entity36 - authored constitutional amendment to allow the states and federal government to regulate campaign financing			0
most republicans oppose the approach but may vote to take it up nonetheless if for no other reason than to shrink the window into which @entity36 can propose other measures @entity32 consider political show votes			0
the constitutional amendment has virtually no chance of getting through the @entity32 - controlled @entity14 , not to mention ratification by three - quarters of the states as would be required			0
it is sponsored by several @entity36 up for re-election and has been championed by senate majority leader @entity200 , who routinely blasts the billionaire @entity202 brothers for spending millions to help @entity32 win control of the chamber this fall			0
with the @entity15 set to leave town september 23 -- after just 12 work days -- @entity200 warned before the august break senators might be forced to work weekends in september to complete their business			0
according to aides , that heavy workload may include bills to boost the minimum wage , reform the federal student loan programs , and other @entity36 priorities			0
@entity32 oppose those bills and bristle at @entity36 for clogging the calendar with measures designed to rally the liberal base and boost @entity36 candidates , not actually pass laws .			0

at the top of the list , passing a funding bill to avoid another government shutdown
@entity3 will also hear from president @entity73 on his plan to combat @entity9
little else is expected to be done with midterm elections less than two months away
