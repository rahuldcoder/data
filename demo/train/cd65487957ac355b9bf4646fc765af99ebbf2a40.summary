former " @entity13 " actress @entity10 , 62 , was hospitalized this week			0
she received a diagnosis of anal cancer in 2006			1
this type of cancer is less common than rectal and colon cancer , and the location of the tumor and risk factors make people squeamish about discussing it openly , doctors said			1
@entity25 at one time also was not openly talked about , because of the body part and functions affected , but with the public awareness campaigns and celebrities advocating for screenings , it has been largely destigmatized			0
anal cancer is less familiar			1
@entity10 has not publicly confirmed the specifics of her illness , but is working on a documentary , titled " a wing and a prayer , " about her health battle			0
anal cancer affects more women and the illness is usually found in people who are in their early 60 's			1
the @entity43 estimates that 5,000 new cases of anal cancer are diagnosed each year and about 680 people die from it annually			1
meanwhile , colorectal cancer has 148,000 new cases and about 50,000 deaths each year			1
the numbers of anal cancer cases are rising , although experts have n't been able to pinpoint why			1
cultural squeamishness about certain body areas could prevent early diagnosis and treatment of anal cancer , said dr. @entity59 , an associate professor of medicine at the @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63			1
" patients in the @entity4 hate to be examined in these areas , " said @entity59 , who trained in @entity64			0
" they like to keep their private parts more private than in @entity68			0
in the @entity4 , the patients hate those exams and physicians hate to do them			0
" the cultural discomfort might be a minor factor , though			0
" the bigger role is the virus , " he said referring to the human papilloma virus , a key risk factor for anal cancer that also can cause cervical cancer			1
getting vaccinated against @entity81 is a step in prevention , @entity59 said			2
more than half of anal cancer patients experience bleeding as a symptom			1

symptoms also include itching or pain in that area , changes in the diameter of stool , abnormal discharge , swollen lymph nodes in the anal or groin areas , according to the @entity43			2

anal pap smears are routine only for hiv - positive patients , who are at higher risk for this cancer			2
there are no anal cancer screening recommendations for @entity118 individuals , because it remains a rare disease , @entity59 said			1
people whose immune system are suppressed , from @entity123 or drugs taken after organ transplants are at risk for anal cancer			1
other risk factors include a sexual history with many partners , a medical history of human papilloma virus ( @entity81 ) , sexually transmitted diseases or gynecological cancers			1
people tend to view anal cancer negatively , because they associate the cancer with a few of its risk factors -- such as sexually transmitted diseases or anal sex , @entity135 said			1
" it 's one of the risk factors , not the only risk factor , " @entity135 said			1
" it 's fair to say people are stigmatized , she said , primarily because of the disease 's association with that type of sex			0
when anal cancer is caught early , chemotherapy and radiation are highly effective			1
but if the cancer does n't respond to treatment and spreads to other areas of the body , the five - year survival rate plummets to 20 percent , @entity135 said			2
" anal cancer is unique , " she said			2
" the majority of time you can cure the patient , but if you have recurrent or residual disease , you could end up losing your sphincter			0

if the sphincter is removed , the patient must have a special bag , called an ostomy pouch , that collects the waste			0
anal cancer is " much rarer than colon cancer , " @entity59 said			2
" for 50 colon cancer patients , we see one anal cancer ... it 's a rare disease			2
it is becoming a little bit more frequent			0
