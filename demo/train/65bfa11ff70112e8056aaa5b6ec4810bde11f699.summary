-- former captain @entity1 insists he can still be a key player for @entity2 after becoming the third cricketer to score 13,000 @entity4 runs on the opening day of the fourth and final match against @entity7			1
doubts were raised about @entity1 's international future when he stood down as skipper early last year , but the 37 - year - old has now scored two centuries in this series after a barren run with the bat			1
with @entity2 holding a 3 - 0 lead going into the @entity19 match , the tourists are facing a whitewash after @entity1 and his successor @entity21 put on a record - breaking 252 runs on tuesday			1
@entity1 was on 137 and @entity23 at stumps as @entity2 reached 335 - 3 in hot conditions , breaking their own record for the fourth wicket against @entity7 at the venue			1
@entity1 joined @entity31 opponents @entity29 ( 15,432 ) and @entity32 ( 13,262 ) as the only players to have passed the 13,000 milestone , ending the day 56 runs past that mark			2
it was his 41st test century , putting him level with @entity40 's second - placed @entity39 and 10 behind @entity29			1
" am i still the player i was ? i 'm not sure , " @entity1 told reporters			0
" you guys can answer that , you 've seen me over a long period of time , but at the end of the day i think if i can keep making test match hundreds or having an impact on winning games for @entity2 , then that 's what i 'm all about at the moment			2
" it is interesting to ask the same question about @entity29 or @entity32 or @entity39 , the guys the same sort of age as me that are still out there playing test cricket			0
" we 've probably all realized that we ca n't play the same way forever , right through our careers , and i do n't think there 's been anybody that has been able to do that through 160 test matches			0
" but i 'm giving it my best shot to be the best player i can be , and to win games for @entity2 , and if i can keep playing like i did today then hopefully there 's more runs around the corner			0
" @entity1 scored 134 in @entity2 's innings victory in the second test in @entity77 , where @entity21 posted an unbeaten 329 as they added 288 together			1
" i felt i played better today than i did in @entity77 as well , probably a better wicket to bat on than @entity77 was -- there was n't much in it for the @entity31 bowlers , no sideways movement for the quicks , not a lot of spin , a little bit of reverse swing during the middle of the day , " @entity1 said			2
he revealed he has adapted to his new role at no. 4 , having dropped down a spot in the order			0
" i know my place in the team , @entity21 's the leader now and i 've stepped back from all that responsibility i once had , " @entity1 said			2
" the last couple of years being the captain and batting at three was getting more and more difficult for me			0
not being the captain now and having that little bit of extra time between change of innings to sit back and relax and take it all in has probably been good for me			0
