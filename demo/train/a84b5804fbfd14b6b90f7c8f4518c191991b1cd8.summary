no one used the word reward , but the subtext was clear for all to see			2
in april 2007 , when @entity3 and @entity4 were surprisingly awarded the right to co-host the 2012 @entity6 -- one of international football 's top tournaments after the @entity10 -- both countries ' delegations exploded with joy			1
for the @entity4 it was especially poignant			1
at the center of the celebrations was president @entity17 , who had come to power leading the 2004 @entity19 , ignited when the election battle between him and the then prime minister @entity21 was allegedly riddled with fraud			2
massive street protests swept away the old regime , whose last desperate attempt to cling on to power , according to supporters of @entity17 , was a plot to poison the challenger			2
but survive he did , and the chance to host @entity32 was redemption			1
@entity4 was finally , post communism , moving towards democracy and the rule of law			1
@entity32 represented a chance , as the @entity38 did in @entity39 and @entity40 decades before , for sport to welcome @entity4 into the club of free nations			1
" we will be able to show millions of fans the unforgettable charm of our cities and the history they have preserved so beautifully , " @entity17 said when @entity4 's joint bid was selected to host the tournament			1
" and put on display of @entity53 hospitality and culture			0
" a coronation the final in @entity57 on july 1 , 2012 , was to be the coronation			0
but with a month to go until @entity4 was to enjoy its moment in the sun , @entity17 's words ring hollow			1
he was voted out of power in 2010 , his @entity19 unraveling as , according to his supporters , the new president @entity21 -- ironically the man he defeated in 2004 -- tries to roll back the gains made eight years ago			0
and far from highlighting @entity4 's development , @entity32 has done the opposite			1
instead @entity70 statesmen and women are boycotting the event as the blond heroine of the @entity19 , former prime minister @entity74 , languishes in a prison cell thanks to what her supporters claim are spurious political charges			1
last week her family released pictures of what they say is proof that @entity74 was beaten up in prison , which the @entity4 government denies			1
" her condition is worsening , her physical condition , " her daughter @entity87 told @entity88			1
" that was after eight days of hunger strike			0
she was already much weaker because of the attacks when they beat her on april 20			0
because of her protest her morale is very strong ( but ) we have asked her to stop her hunger strike			0
" @entity74 has been in prison since october last year			1
she received a seven - year sentence for abuse of power over the signing of a gas deal with @entity106 that the current president deemed detrimental to the national interest			0
but few outside of @entity4 saw it as anything other than the persecution of a political rival			1
" once she was arrested , there was a whole machine that started working , " said @entity87			2
" they wanted to keep her in jail as her popularity was growing			0
she is now more popular			0
it is mostly fear that moved him and his people to keep her there until the ( parliamentary ) elections in october this year			0
" " it 's just political repression and they have moved to physical destruction			2
my mother is now on hunger strike because other political prisoners are suffering in jail with no medical help			2
" political controversy the pictures of @entity74 , baring her bruises to the camera , have created a firestorm in @entity70 's corridors of power			1
when it emerged that @entity147 's chancellor @entity146 was considering a boycott of the event to protest @entity74 's treatment , other @entity144 leaders followed suit			1
@entity144 president @entity152 has said he wo n't attend -- as has @entity153 , president of the @entity154 , who less than 12 months ago had met with president @entity21 and was presented with an official @entity32 match ball			1
the governments of @entity157 and @entity158 have all said they will not be attending			0
@entity3 's opposition , who were in power when the @entity162 were awarded , has called for @entity4 's matches to be moved to @entity164			2
the @entity166 and @entity167 governments are re-evaluating their positions			0
even some of the players have spoken out			0
@entity147 captain @entity171 told newspaper @entity172 that he did not find his " views of democratic fundamental rights , human rights , personal freedom or press freedom to be reflected in the present political situation in @entity4			1
" while @entity106 premier @entity179 has criticized the boycotts -- stating that " you ca n't mix politics , business and other issues with sport " -- and the @entity4 foreign ministry has condemned the outcry for causing " damage to the interests of millions of ordinary @entity4 that vote for various political parties or are not interested in politics at all , " others point the finger of blame for the crisis at the @entity4 government			1
" there has been progress in many ways and the last round of elections that elected @entity21 was largely free and fair , " admitted @entity198 , @entity70 and @entity200 director of @entity201			0
" but we have particular concerns about what @entity21 has done in prosecuting his political opponents			2
few ( @entity4 government figures ) have spoken out about her ( @entity74 's ) mistreatment and there 's clear evidence that the charges against her are politically motivated			1
" should fans boycott ? while @entity201 stops short of calling for a fan boycott of the tournament , it does support moves by political leaders to make a stand			2
" should politicians watch matches ? we think they should speak out clearly			0
if they decide to not see a match ... we welcome that that is a clear signal , " @entity198 said			0
" one could see a more extreme case with @entity230 and the ( 2008 ) @entity38			0
there 's a clear risk that by allowing such countries to host such sporting contests , it legitimizes their actions			0
" yet the scandal has highlighted a much more fundamental tension at the heart of @entity4 society : whether , as those that led the @entity19 contest , @entity4 's future lays westwards , towards the @entity144 ; or whether its future is in the east and with @entity106 , the direction in which the current president is moving			1
" the story of the @entity252 was supposed to be bridge building between the two different @entity254 , cooperation across borders between east and west , " argued dr. @entity248 , an expert in @entity4 politics at @entity166 's @entity250			2
" but no , the story now is the good performance of @entity3			0
their success is in stark contrast with the problems in @entity4			2
" he also suggested that the criticism that has followed the @entity74 case could push many @entity4 away from @entity144 integration , and towards the @entity269 's sphere of influence			1
" yes the boycott will have an effect , " @entity248 said			0
" @entity273 matters to this guy @entity21			0
they hoped the @entity162 would give them prestige			0
the argument that @entity4 will turn to @entity106 is one made by @entity4			2
they say : ' criticize us after we 've made it , not before			0
' " not everyone is sympathetic to @entity74 's plight in @entity4			1
president @entity21 has repeatedly said that there was a criminal case to answer for			0
" if @entity74 were looking for a compromise she would tell the truth to the @entity4 people about why she broke the law , " he told @entity166 newspaper @entity285 in a bellicose interview last year			1
@entity19 fatigue and others point to @entity74 's poor political performance while prime minister for the lack of sympathy she has received in @entity4			1
" the @entity19 was a huge disappointment , " explained @entity248			0
" @entity298 improved , civil society is stronger , but the @entity19 leaders fought like rats in a sack , especially @entity74 and former president @entity17			1
after five years of infighting , there was @entity19 fatigue			0
" others in @entity4 point to the the failure of arguably the most infamous sporting boycott in history : the decision by the @entity310 to snub the @entity311 in protest at the @entity314 's invasion of @entity315			2
the @entity314 returned the favor four years after for the 1984 @entity317			0
" the experience of boycotting the @entity38 of 1980 in @entity321 by the @entity322 and the counter strike ( by the ) socialist camp of the @entity317 in @entity325 did not influence political events too much but spoiled the careers of some great athletes , " says @entity318 , a @entity4 sports journalist who writes for @entity319			1
" the whole country expects something similar to a game of football with two halves			0
" at first @entity4 would like to host with honor and dignity the biggest ever sporting event on its territory , while the second half will start in october this year when many of them will go to the ballot boxes to support opposition parties who promise to free @entity74			1
" yet for all the pressure , the tournament is unlikely to be moved			0
in a statement , the head of @entity4 's @entity32 organizing committee @entity347 admitted that while " there are certain appeals by @entity70 politicians to @entity355 " over the issue of @entity74 as well as a myriad of other security concerns , " the issue of moving the tournament ( to @entity3 ) was not considered even theoretically			1
it is impossible from a technical point of view or otherwise			0
" but as the political row rages , @entity74 remains in jail on hunger strike as @entity4 's reputation crumbles			1
what once seemed like a reward now looks like a curse			0
@entity87 believes that the blame rests with one man			2
" the political boycott is the result of the government and the actions of president @entity21 that are against @entity70 standards that the @entity144 wants to see , " she said			1
" the previous government had given ( @entity4 ) this wondrous opportunity for this celebration of sport with the @entity252			2
" and i think @entity70 leaders do not want to be see ( the president ) use this politically , using repression and torture against political opponents			2

as @entity32 approaches , co-hosts @entity4 under fire over jailing of ex-pm
@entity74 alleges they are political charges and that she was beaten in prison
@entity144 leaders are boycotting the finals over her treatment
@entity88 talks to her daughter @entity87 and asks what went wrong ?
