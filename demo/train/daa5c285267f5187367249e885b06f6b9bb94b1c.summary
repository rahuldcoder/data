-- @entity2 @entity1 pushed through a trillion - dollar farm bill -- approved by the @entity4 tuesday -- that will cut food stamps by $ 8 billion over the next decade and reduce food allotments for more than 850,000 households by around $ 90 a month			1
the measure passed despite opposition from @entity11 republicans who were seeking even more savage cuts			2
if the @entity1 hopes to revive the @entity15 - era idea of " compassionate conservatism , " this is n't the way to do it			1
the bill was the culmination of a three - year battle over food stamps , also called the @entity22 , or @entity22			2
@entity2 @entity23 who supported the measure said they compromised			0
this version , they said , was better than previous ones ; @entity11 @entity1 had wanted a 5 % cut , not 1 %			1
the @entity2 has signaled that president @entity30 will sign the bill			0
he should n't , but this is a pragmatic president			2
that the legislation slashes aid to hungry children might be justifiable if it did n't also hand out $ 90 billion over 10 years -- $ 7 billion more than before -- in subsidized crop insurance to farmers , which virtually guarantees revenue			1
the agribusiness lobby , which includes large farming concerns as well as publicly traded corporations like @entity43 and @entity44 , spent $ 111 million pressing lawmakers , according to @entity46			1
that 's more than the defense and union lobbies combined			0
@entity51 rep. @entity50 , a @entity52 who voted against the measure , called it " nothing more than reverse @entity57 legislation that steals food from the poor in favor of crop subsidies for the rich			2
" if not for the hungry children , there might be a bright side			0
it 's not every day that the real constituency of establishment @entity1 is revealed so clearly			1
typically , the @entity1 's representation of big business is shrouded by rhetorical expressions of concern for workaday @entity73			1
for instance , after president @entity30 announced he would use his executive authority to raise the base wage of workers employed by companies with federal contracts , house speaker @entity74 accused @entity30 of hurting workers by hurting their employers			0
" we know from increases in the minimum wage in the past that hundreds of thousands of low - income americans have lost their jobs , and so the very people the president purports to help are the ones who are going to get hurt by this , " @entity74 told reporters last week on @entity84			0
while it may sound credible to argue that paying workers $ 3 and some change more per hour actually hurts them in the long run ( because businesses hiring them shed workers to avoid paying more ) , it 's completely incredible to say feeding hungry @entity73 more hurts them			2
the most extreme wing of the @entity1 , including those who opposed the farm bill , claims that it spends money the government does n't have			1
if so , such moments of scarcity demand tough and moral decisions be made according to priorities			0
with this bill , the @entity1 have said loudly that corporations with billions in revenue are more important than children			1
the @entity1 ' real constituency is n't the only thing exposed			1
so is their opposition to " redistribution			2
" that 's movement conservatism 's core complaint with the welfare state : they say government takes money from hard - working @entity73 , who play by the rules and strive to succeed , and gives it to the undeserving poor			2
another variation comes from talk - radio show host @entity128 : " redistribution is theft , " he said last month			2
" it is a powerful government taking from people they deem to have too much , or more than they need , and then just giving it to people they deem worthy of receiving it			0
" but as this farm bill reveals , @entity1 are not opposed to redistribution at all			1
the question is n't whether the government should redistribute			0
the question is who should get the distributions			0
@entity1 have argued for years that help should only be given to those who help themselves			1
during a fundraising event , @entity147 , a @entity1 state senator of @entity148 who is challenging @entity149 sen. @entity149 , said : " able - bodied people , if they do n't work , they should n't eat			1
" that argument is exposed as fundamentally bankrupt in light of the fact , as journalist @entity155 reported last year , that " 22 % of children in @entity73 live in poverty -- a number far higher than that in any other peer nation			0
more than 47 million @entity73 avoid hunger only because of the existence of the federal food stamp program			1
" but of course this is about hungry children			0
perhaps worst of all is the moral climate created and maintained by @entity170 in which depriving children of food is permissible			0
case in point : in @entity179 recently , around 40 students in one of @entity178 's elementary schools watched as food - service workers seized their lunches and threw them into the trash			0
the reason ? unpaid meal accounts			0
said one outraged mother : " these are young children that should n't be punished			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			1

@entity191 : if @entity1 wants " compassionate conservatism , " food stamp cuts are n't the way
@entity191 : cuts might be justified if agribusiness did n't get $ 90 billion over 10 years
he says the @entity1 is not opposed to redistribution of *wealth* if it gets distributed to the *wealth*y
