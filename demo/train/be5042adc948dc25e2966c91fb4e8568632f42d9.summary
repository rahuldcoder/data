-- what is jazz ? this is an impossible question , and one with many answers			1
having spent more than a decade as a jazz artist , i 've garnered some insights			1
as a youngster growing up in @entity9 , surrounded by the city 's sounds and rhythms , i was influenced by a wide variety of music : brass bands , blues , ragtime , r&b , soul , rock ' n ' roll , @entity21 and more			1
i played the percussion in my family 's band , switching to piano at age 11			1
since then , music has been a part of my everyday life			1
i 've had the good fortune to play with inspiring artists across many genres -- @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 among them			2
what 's given me the foundation to be able to join such varied musicians is my jazz training			1
@entity40 is subtle , emotional and accommodating			1
it is intellectual and sometimes even scientific			2
most genres of music are not nearly as multidimensional , which in part is why the art form has such a small audience			2
in stark comparison to pop music , contemporary jazz seems too circuitous for most listeners to enjoy casually			1
the challenge for the contemporary jazz musician , as i see it , is making this subtle and complex art palatable to the greater public			1
some of the greatest musical minds of all - time were jazz artists			1
they were able to master their instruments , redefine music theory and repeatedly innovate the already formidable body of work present before them			2
many of them did so while navigating through the tumultuous social climate from which the music was birthed			2
@entity69 : @entity70 , ambassador to a new @entity71 as a performer , part of my job is to take the audience on a musical journey to somewhere they 've never been			1
the @entity80 movement i 've started is about experiencing music -- not about it being on a stage and untouchable , but something that you viscerally experience on the subways and streets			2
@entity80 has grown to be more than a band , and has become a local movement that is expanding and shifting the way people experience jazz			2
we 're trying to harness all of the musical elements that i grew up absorbing in @entity9 , and couple them with contemporary mainstream sounds			1
i want people to feel and hear jazz as they never thought it could be played			2
in the midst of the " plug in / tune out " nature of modern day society , we believe that the human interaction of a live musical performance can uplift humanity			1
not only in a music hall or official venue , but on streets and subways or among unsuspecting ( and often pleased ) patrons at a restaurant			2
we refer to these moments as a # loveriot and anyone can join			2
keeping the @entity117 alive at the core of the experience is the band , a group of my friends who are all world - class , @entity125 - trained musicians in their 20s			2
the music is central to the experience , but it is n't just about the music			0
ultimately , it 's about people from all walks of life coming together to share an authentic and transformative moment through the power of music			1
@entity137 once said , " i 've learned that people will forget what you said , people will forget what you did , but people will never forget how you made them feel			0
" @entity40 is a tradition			1
the way jazz musicians walk , talk and greet each other , and the way they play is very distinct			0
to be a jazz artist is to be a part of a lineage			0
to play jazz is to contribute to world history			0
to be a part of this tradition means that you are challenged to transform other people with the sound of your instrument			0
you are challenged to swing			0
you are challenged to contribute to the body of work established by some of the greatest artistic minds of all time , work that includes these treasures : a performance of " @entity168 " by @entity169 , @entity170 and others from a @entity173 television broadcast in @entity174 on december 8 , 1957			0
it is generally considered one of the greatest moments for jazz ever broadcast on live television			0
" @entity186 " by @entity187 features catchy vocals , hard swing , jazz violin and awesome horn section parts that epitomize what the jazz tradition is all about			0
" @entity188 " @entity189 and @entity190 from their album together			0
exquisite ! " i 'm just a @entity195 " from the album by @entity197 and @entity187			0
it is a supreme example of the blues with utmost sophistication and feeling			0
the way @entity203 accompanies @entity197 is masterful , and the personality of the two of them signifies what jazz is all about			0
@entity209 : @entity70 , jazz master with a big heart as an artist , it is exciting to explore the sound of your identity			0
jazz music teaches you about who you are by exploring the humanity of others			0
it accommodates who you are			0
the inimitable genius @entity223 stated it best when he said , " music is your own experience , your own thoughts , your wisdom			0
if you do n't live it , it wo n't come out of your horn			0
they teach you there 's a boundary line to music			1
but , man , there 's no boundary line to art. " @entity40 is an experience			1
@entity40 is wonderful because it 's all about the moment , and i firmly believe in creating unforgettable experiences			1
with the @entity80 band , it 's never only about the stage			1
what we love is taking the music to the people in the streets -- jumping off stage into the audience , performing in moving vehicles , @entity174 subways , streets and , yes , unsuspecting restaurants			0
for me , jazz is all about transformation in the moment			0
it is the most immediate form of musical expression in existence , and the language that we use to state our deepest , truest feelings			1
it is the @entity71 art form that is globally owned			0
what is jazz ? jazz is now ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity273 .			1

@entity273 : @entity40 is the musical language used to state our deepest , truest feelings
@entity273 says it 's complex and traditional but also contemporary
performers aim to take listeners on a journey to someplace new and different , he says
