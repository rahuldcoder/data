this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity11 , @entity12 : hey ! i 'm @entity14 , and you 're watching @entity17 student news ! this is our last show of the school year , and we 're gon na get things started with a little help from our friends			1
( begin video ) @entity25 , @entity26 [ @entity27 ] : one , two , three ... hit it ! @entity29 : start your tractor , @entity32 ! @entity33 ( @entity34 ) , @entity35 ( @entity36 ) , @entity37 ( @entity38 ) , @entity39 ( scarecrow ) : you are about to enter the wonderful world of the wizard			1
@entity42 : ladies , fellows , girls and boys ... join me please and make some noise			1
@entity49 ] @entity50 , @entity51 : hi , i 'm @entity52			1
i might not be @entity14 , but this is an exciting edition of @entity0			1
@entity54 , @entity51 : [ @entity55 ] ... and you 're watching @entity0			1
@entity57 , @entity58 : take it away , @entity32 ! hey , wait up ! @entity60			1
@entity61 , @entity51 : you are watching @entity17 student news ! ( @entity65 ) first up : northeast @entity66 @entity67 : first up , we 're looking at some of today 's headlines , starting with tornadoes in @entity4			1
several twisters hit the state on wednesday , and @entity74 -- one of the largest cities in @entity4 -- was hit badly			1
at least two tornadoes touched down there			1
you can see some of the damage that was left behind			2
at least four people were killed			2
dozens of other people were injured			2
rescue workers were going door - to - door early thursday looking for survivors			2
this could be a record year for tornadoes , but you do n't see too many of them up in @entity4			1
that 's part of the reason why these storms made such an impact			1
sen. @entity96 , ( @entity97 ) @entity4 : and magnitude , when you see those houses flattened , really hits you			1
in 45 years of public service , i have never seen this kind of damage or devastation in @entity4			1
and as many of the residents said to me , " this is @entity4 , this is not supposed to happen here			1
" and it never has to our recollection			2
new @entity112 @entity67 : for a while now , @entity114 nutrition standards have been based off different versions of the food pyramid			1
a lot of people say the pyramid was too confusing			2
so yesterday , officials ditched the pyramid for a plate			2
it 's called " @entity127 , " and it 's the government 's new standard for nutrition			1
about half of the plate , half of what the government says people should be eating , is made up of fruits and vegetables			2
whole grains and lean protein make up the other half , with a side of dairy			2
officials hope that simplifying the standards this way will help @entity114 eat better			1
a lot of health experts agree it 's better than the old pyramid			2
but some say that the new @entity127 does n't give people enough information to make the best choices			2
@entity151 @entity152 , @entity12 : today 's shoutout goes out to all of the students and teachers who watch @entity17 student news ! which of these headlines came first ? here we go ! was it : a ) earthquake strikes @entity163 , b ) revolution in @entity165 , c ) @entity168 miners rescued or @entity97 ) @entity114 holds @entity169 ? three seconds on the clock -- go ! the @entity168 miners were rescued before any of these other stories happened			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! top stories of the @entity178 @entity67 : those were some of the biggest stories that made headlines during this school year			1
we 're going to take a look back now at the top stories from 2010 - 2011 , and we 're including some of your comments along the way			1
set your clocks back to august , and here we go			1
( begin video ) @entity67 : from @entity191 : being a military child myself , i know that many families across @entity114 have been affected by the wars in @entity197 and @entity198			1
it is really hard to go through a deployment when you have a loved one fighting in the war			2
@entity203 : daddy ! @entity114 vice president @entity206 : our goal , our goal is not just a physically secure @entity197 , but an economically and prosperous and stable one as well			1
@entity67 : from @entity210 : the rescue of the @entity168 miners was one of the most touching stories reported during the whole year			1
the rescue was so breathtaking and the reactions of everyone were so sincere			2
@entity218 , @entity17 national correspondent : august 5th ; 2 in the afternoon ; 2,300 feet underground , a shaft collapses in the @entity221 copper and gold mine			2
33 miners are somewhere behind the rubble , their condition unknown			2
the @entity168 president promises every effort to rescue them			2
finally , after more than 2 months buried alive , salvation			2
@entity230 , @entity17 anchor : never has a man been underground so long and gotten out alive			2
@entity233 : chi ! le ! @entity234 ... @entity235 ! @entity236 ! @entity67 : from @entity237 : during the @entity114 midterm elections , i started to wish i could vote			1
i got excited to see who would win or lose the elections			0
@entity243 @entity242 , ( r ) @entity244 , house speaker : let me just say this : it 's clear tonight who the winners really are , and that 's the @entity114 people			1
sen. @entity251 , ( @entity252 ) @entity253 , majority leader : this race has been called , but the fight is far from over			0
the bell that just rang is n't the end of the fight , it 's the start of the next round			0
@entity67 : from @entity262 : in my honest opinion , i think that our country has not improved in the economy			0
gas prices have continued to rise , and your everyday tools prices are soaring			0
many prices on things are unbelievable			0
from @entity274 's class : we believe that the upheaval in @entity278 nations was a top story because it affected the whole world			0
after these events , our class started to pay more attention to the news			0
@entity285 : we will die for our freedom ! @entity287 , @entity289 leader : we will be victorious in this fight			0
@entity67 : from @entity291 : i live in @entity293 , so the tsunami was really shocking to me			0
@entity163 is getting over the damage			0
we are so grateful for the help and prayers from all over the world			0
@entity285 : oh , my @entity299 ! @entity67 : from @entity300 : every night i pray that the people whose lives have been impacted from the natural disasters get better			0
@entity304 : we 're talking about the deadliest tornado season since 1953 , that 's what we 're experiencing right now			0
@entity285 : it 's something you do n't want to experience			0
you do n't want to experience nothing like this			0
it ai n't a good feeling , it ai n't nothing you can do about it			0
@entity67 : from @entity316 : when @entity318 died , i thought it was probably the biggest story reported this year			1
considering he was the starter of a terrorist group and the cause of 9/11 , i do think justice was done			0
@entity114 president @entity324 : i can report to the @entity114 people and to the world that the @entity114 has conducted an operation that killed @entity318 , the leader of @entity329 , and a terrorist who 's responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men , women and children			1
( @entity65 ) before we go @entity67 : okay , before we go , you know we always like to have a little pun at the end of our show			0
i 've chosen my top 5 favorite puns of the school year			1
and right now , you get to sit through every punful one of them again			0
let 's goose this up ! when a bird joined a couple canines on their walk through the park , we had to give it wings on the air			0
after all , what 's good for a goose is good for a gander			0
okay , then , there was this zip - line over a reptile pit			0
to protect the people , you 'd think they 'd have a gate or something			0
to protect the reptiles , you 'd need a little gator aid ! when a retriever took some ducklings under her wing -- or paw -- you could see she did n't duck any responsibility			0
it would n't fit the bill			0
and as far as duck puns go , you 've got to admit they quack you up			0
and after a group of presidential mascots took off running -- that 's running a race , not ' running a race ' -- you want a clean match			0
anything less elects a commander - in - cheat			0
my favorite had to be this one , though			0
back in august , we showed a butterfly causing a bunch of penguins to flip out			1
now , we could 've talked about the butterfly effect , said this was frightless versus flightless , said the butterfly ruled them like a monarch			0
but instead , we settled on this : the pupa becomes the master			0
goodbye @entity67 : sure , they might bug you from time to time , but you know we larva good pun here at @entity0			1
as we sign off for the summer , we want to thank all of you who watch and use our show			0
especially those of you who have sent us ireports , @entity151 requests ; those of you who 've posted on our blog ; those of you who 've visited our @entity415 page			0
we hope you 'll check out @entity416 over the summer			0
