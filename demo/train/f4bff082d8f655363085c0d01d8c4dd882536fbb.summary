-- it 's been almost a decade since @entity4 ' " lifted or the story is in the @entity2 , " the epic 2002 album that established @entity6 as the pain - strumming poet of emo and the newest of the @entity10			1
but the 22 - year - old had n't asked for either gig			0
so @entity6 spent the 2000s abjuring big statements , choosing to scale down his sound , bum around @entity17 and try to figure himself out			1
" i 've taken some comfort			0
" he sings on @entity4 ' first album in nearly four years , " knowing i do n't have to be an exception			1
" the latest dispatch from @entity23 weaves the weird knowledge he 's accrued over the years into a rich , sprawling , fragmented record			2
it 's got elements of the hazy synth rock of 2005 's " @entity31 " and echoes of his two recent , rootsy solo albums			2
but being @entity4 again mainly means a break from @entity37 's rustic tranquility and a return to the bruised - angel indie rock of his earliest albums			1
@entity6 brings it all back home by recording in his native @entity43 with @entity4 ' other two permanent members -- multi-instrumentalist @entity45 and producer @entity47 -- plus local pals from @entity49 and the @entity50			1
gallery : @entity52 , @entity54 's @entity53 @entity6 's lyrics explore a mysticism he 's been messing with since 2007 's " @entity57			1
" on " @entity59 ( in the ' @entity63 ' ) , " he 's a futurist seer , tweeting happily from the end of time : " history bows and it steps aside / in the jungle there are columns of purple light / we are starting over			0
" the album is full of nods to @entity72 , including references to " one love " and @entity75			0
@entity6 says he loves reggae 's symbolism and anti-imperialist spirit , and throughout " @entity63 " he uses @entity80 vibrations as an emotional power source			1
on " @entity82 , " through a haze of epic images , the supernatural force " calling me home like @entity82 " ends up being a girl : " i was swimming with you in that cenote the heavens made with black fire			0
" @entity6 's newfound jones for @entity91 is n't even the trippiest thing about " @entity63			1
" several tracks feature the spoken - word ramblings of @entity95 , a @entity96 musician @entity6 met on the road			2
@entity95 's sermonettes -- about the road to enlightenment , our alien ancestors and time as a construct -- work surprisingly well leading into the gently lifting orchestrations of " firewall " or closing out the prayerful electro - folk of " one for you , one for me			0
" @entity4 : king of @entity109 giving a chunk of your record over to some random old - timer 's bullshit is a classic @entity6 move , a way of undercutting the aura of importance people have foisted on his music since he was in high school			1
it 's especially shrewd because " @entity63 " contains some of his most weighty songwriting -- the head - clearing clamor of " @entity82 " or the somber " @entity130 , " where @entity6 ruefully sings , " it 's been said we 're post-everything			2
" his greatest quality is that he refuses to be post-anything			0
he manages to be everything at once : folkie and punk , old soul and eternal boy , high - plains drifter and hipster heartthrob			0
he 's busy being born again every time he strums a chord			0
