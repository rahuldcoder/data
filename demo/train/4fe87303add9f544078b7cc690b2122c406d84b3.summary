@entity1 government forces seized control wednesday of the strategically important border city of @entity4 , which had been the site of nearly seven weeks of fighting			1
state - run tv credited an offensive " that led to the annihilation of a number of terrorists , " the government 's term for rebels			0

the @entity1 opposition acknowledged the report			2
" yes , dear brethren , this is a battle that we lost , but the war is not over yet , " said the @entity22 , which is associated with the @entity23 , an opposition activist network			0
one dissident group said @entity29 , the powerful @entity31 @entity30 militia backed by @entity32 and the @entity1 government , was instrumental in the siege 's success			1
" @entity29 fighters took control of @entity4 city after the regime forces covered their night attack with heavy bombing ... and continued into the morning , " the @entity36 said			2
eleven of the regime 's security forces were killed and 25 others were injured in the @entity4 fighting overnight and on wednesday , the @entity36 group said			2

@entity57 : sarin gas used in @entity1 the government 's capture of @entity4 came on the day that @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 officials met in @entity65 to plan an international conference on the @entity1 crisis			1
after wednesday 's meeting , the @entity64 ' special representative for @entity1 , @entity68 , told reporters that the conference would n't happen in june as previously expected but could take place in july			2
the loss of what had been a rebel stronghold near the @entity31 border represents a blow to rebels ' efforts to oust @entity1 president @entity80 and may portend heightened sectarian tensions			1
that echoes what rebels have been predicting for weeks : that a government takeover of @entity4 could lead to a new level of sectarian warfare between @entity88 -- who dominate @entity1 's population -- and @entity30 and @entity91			1
@entity93 's family , which has ruled @entity1 for 42 years , belongs to the @entity91 sect			1
" if @entity4 falls at the hands of the regime , there is no way to stop the acts of reprisal , and that retribution will ( reach ) another level , " rebel spokesman col. @entity96 told the @entity97 last month			0
" this will lead to @entity30 and @entity91 towns to be completely wiped out of the map			0
" indeed , video appeared wednesday on @entity110 showing what the poster said were @entity114 fighters launching rockets at two @entity30 villages , inhabited mostly by @entity80 loyalists , in an overwhelmingly @entity88 region in the northeastern province of @entity120			0
meanwhile , on wednesday , rockets fell on the mostly @entity91 neighborhoods of @entity124 and @entity125 in the city of @entity127 , the @entity36 group said			1
last week , @entity128 gen. @entity129 of the @entity130 asked the public to " excuse ( the ) @entity114 " for any retaliation			0
" we are being subjected to genocide conducted by @entity29 , " he told @entity134			0
@entity57 has said that @entity29 sent as many as 4,000 fighters to @entity1 to bolster @entity80 's forces			1
the @entity31 militants " produced major results , " particularly in the battle for @entity4 , said @entity139 , director of the @entity140 at the @entity141			0
the @entity147 administration condemned " in the strongest possible terms " the takeover of @entity4 , press secretary @entity145 said			0
" it is clear that the regime could not contest the opposition 's control of @entity4 on its own and is depending upon ( @entity29 ) and @entity32 to do its work for it in @entity4 , " @entity145 said in a statement			2
@entity29 's " involvement in @entity1 and the @entity1 regime 's cross border attack today on @entity160 represent blatant violations of @entity31 's sovereignty and a deliberate threat to @entity31 stability			1
the @entity62 firmly supports @entity31 's security , stability and sovereignty , " @entity145 added			1
@entity31 's leaders call for a policy of disassociation from the @entity1 conflict , @entity145 said			1
@entity172 secretary - general @entity171 condemned any form of foreign intervention in @entity1 , especially @entity29 , but he expressed frustration			1
" you could say the @entity172 has not succeeded to stop the conflict			0
but also the @entity64 -- with all its powers -- could not do anything ! " he said			0
" the international community has not succeeded in stopping the violence or the humanitarian catastrophe which the @entity1 people are experiencing			0
" war - torn @entity1 issues travel warning against @entity185 @entity4 's importance @entity4 's location has made it a crucial battleground for regime and rebel forces			2
the government 's control of the city helps secure a critical link between the capital , @entity198 , and @entity91 strongholds such as @entity200 and @entity201 , said @entity202 , an analyst at @entity203 and @entity204			2
he said the rebels ' loss will likely spark a rise in cross-border attacks on @entity30 towns in eastern @entity31 and possible attacks on @entity29 forces farther inside the country			1
@entity129 of the @entity114 has said that the @entity1 rebels will hunt @entity29 down in @entity31 and " in hell , if they have to , " over the @entity30 militia intervention in @entity1			1
@entity217 : do n't let @entity1 's children die @entity220 's deputy , sheikh @entity219 , responded by saying that his party can protect its @entity30 supporters in @entity31 and they " will punish the murderers who attack @entity31 's sovereignty			1
" a @entity1 helicopter fired five missiles into @entity228 , near the @entity31 town of @entity160 , which is largely @entity88 and has served as a refuge for people who fled @entity4 ; no casualties were reported , the @entity225 said wednesday			1
@entity31 's @entity233 reported that clashes were occurring in @entity235 between residents of rival areas of the city -- the @entity235 neighborhood , which is dominated by @entity88 , and the adjacent @entity235 neighborhood , which is dominated by @entity91			1
" the @entity1 conflict is no longer an internal struggle between @entity80 and the internal opposition , " @entity139 said			0
" it 's an open - ended war by proxy -- @entity32 , @entity29 and @entity1 , @entity185 , @entity246 and @entity247 , plus @entity63 and the @entity62			1
" shortly after the @entity1 regime seized @entity4 , @entity32 sent congratulations			0
no @entity251 conference in june @entity254 , after wednesday 's meeting with @entity62 and @entity63 officials in @entity251 , told reporters that " it will not be possible to hold the conference ( on @entity1 ) in june			1
" the talks , slated to be held in @entity251 , would have brought together officials from @entity80 's regime and members of the @entity1 opposition to discuss a political solution			2
the three parties organizing the talks -- the @entity62 , @entity63 and the @entity64 -- have agreed the conference will be sponsored by the @entity64 secretary general and will meet again in @entity251 on june 25 to discuss details , @entity254 said			0
officials will look at " windows of opportunities to hold the conference as soon as possible , hopefully in july , " he said			0
@entity93 told @entity29 's @entity273 on may 30 that his government agreed in principle to participate in the talks			2
@entity1 's main rebel umbrella group , the @entity276 , has demanded @entity80 step aside in order for it to take part in the talks			1
meanwhile , sarin gas has been used several times in the @entity1 civil war , including at least once by the @entity80 regime , @entity57 's foreign minister said tuesday , citing results from test samples in @entity57 's possession			1
the evidence of chemical weapons in @entity1 poses a real problem for @entity63 's continued support of the @entity80 regime , a diplomatic source said			1
some in the international community have been surprised by the @entity62 reaction that evidence needs to be expanded and corroborated , but a @entity64 commission for chemicals could be called upon to go to @entity1 to take its own samples and conduct an investigation , the official diplomatic source said			1
@entity302 choice for residents more than 70,000 @entity1 -- most of them civilians -- have been killed in the two - year conflict , according to the @entity64			2

some residents escaped the violence by digging holes and hiding in them , refugees told @entity64 staff			0
most of those who fled @entity4 to @entity31 are women and children			0
" those we have spoken to say it is unsafe to flee with men , who are at heightened risk of being arrested or killed at checkpoints along the way , " said @entity316 , spokeswoman for the @entity64 's refugee agency			0
@entity316 said one woman told the agency that @entity4 residents face a stark choice : " you leave and risk being killed ... or you stay and face a certainty of being killed			0
" but thousands of residents remain in @entity4 , their futures unknown			0
' open - ended ' @entity1 conflict draws in region			0

more than 1,000 civilians are injured ; many remain trapped , group says
