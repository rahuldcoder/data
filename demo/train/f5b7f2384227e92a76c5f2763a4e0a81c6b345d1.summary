tapping away at his computer in the study of the suburban compound in @entity5 , @entity6 , that he called home for the last years of his life , @entity1 wrote memos urging his followers to continue to try to attack the @entity11 , suggesting , for instance , they mount assassination attempts against president @entity14 and gen. @entity15			1
while he urged his organization on to attack @entity11 , @entity1 was also keenly aware that @entity17 was in deep trouble because of the campaign of @entity21 drone strikes in @entity6 and also because the brutal tactics of his followers had alienated many @entity23			1
according to senior @entity14 administration officials who have reviewed the " treasure trove " of the thousands of documents that were picked up by the @entity28 from @entity1 's compound in @entity5 , the leaders of @entity17 understood that the group they led was " beleaguered			1
" @entity31 was given a briefing this week by senior administration officials who have been analyzing the documents			0
@entity1 wrote a 48 - page memo to a deputy in october 2010 that surveyed the state of his organization			2
he was particularly concerned that @entity17 's longtime sanctuary in @entity39 in @entity6 's tribal areas was now too dangerous because of the campaign of @entity11 drone strikes there that had picked off many of his key lieutenants			1
according to a count by the @entity46 , the @entity21 launched a record number of 118 strikes into the tribal regions during 2010 , the year @entity1 wrote this memo			2
@entity1 advised his followers not to move around the tribal regions except on overcast days when @entity11 's all - seeing satellites and drones would not have as good coverage of the area			1
he also urged his followers to depart the tribal regions for the remote @entity56 provinces of @entity57 , @entity58 and , in particular , @entity59 , pointing out that the high mountains and dense forests of @entity59 provided especially good protection from prying @entity11 eyes			2
@entity1 fretted about his 20 - year - old son , @entity64 , who had recently been released from house arrest in @entity66 , instructing his deputy to tell his son to move out of @entity39			0
he also provided elaborate instructions about how @entity64 might evade the surveillance of the @entity11 drones in the tribal regions by meeting members of @entity17 inside a particular tunnel on the road between the western @entity6 town of @entity76 and the city of @entity78			1
during his final days , @entity1 's world was filled with paranoia			1
he instructed that @entity64 should throw out anything he had taken with him from @entity66 as it might contain some kind of tracking device , and that he should avoid the company of a man who might have ties to the @entity6 intelligence services			0
@entity1 also reminded his deputies that all internal communications should be made by letter rather than by phone or the @entity92			0
as a result , according to administration officials , @entity1 had to wait for responses to his queries to his deputies that could sometimes take up to two or three months to be delivered -- surely not an efficient way to run any organization			2
@entity1 also advised his lieutenants that when they kidnapped someone they should take many precautions during the negotiating process and also throw away any bags that contained ransom money because they might also contain a tracking device			0
the spectacular set of self - inflicted mistakes made by @entity17 's affiliate in @entity109 weighed heavily on the minds of @entity1 and his top advisers			1
privately , they criticized the brutal tactics of @entity17 in @entity109 , which had provoked a tribal uprising against @entity17 that had dealt a large blow to the group 's position in @entity109 from 2006 onward			2
until the end , @entity1 remained fixated on attacking the @entity11 , prodding his deputy to " nominate one of the qualified brothers to be responsible for a large operation in the @entity11 " according to administration officials , @entity1 's number two , @entity123 , pushed back , telling @entity1 it was much more realistic to attack @entity11 soldiers in @entity56 than @entity11 civilians in the @entity11			1
@entity1 did urge his followers to scope out opportunities to attack president @entity14 or @entity15 while they were in @entity56			0
at the time , @entity15 was the commanding general of @entity131 soldiers in @entity56			0
@entity1 noted snidely that killing @entity14 would pave the way for vice president @entity133 to assume the presidency			0
the @entity17 leader said @entity133 was " totally unprepared " for the job			1
above all , @entity1 constantly fretted about his media image , pointing out to his deputies that " a huge part of the battle is in the media			0
" for the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks , @entity1 wanted his media team to emphasize particularly that the wars in @entity56 and @entity109 were one of the main reasons for the financial crisis in the @entity11			2
( @entity1 bought his compound in @entity5 with cash , so presumably he did n't quite understand the dimensions of the subprime mortgage debacle			0
) one of his media advisers , who @entity11 officials believe to be the @entity11 @entity17 recruit @entity155 , suggested @entity1 take advantage of the 9/11 anniversary in 2011 to record a ' high definition ' videotape message that could be given to all the major @entity11 news networks , except to @entity161 , which @entity155 said " lacks neutrality			1
" it does n't appear that @entity1 made such a tape			0
administration officials say it is strange that in all the documents recovered at the bin laden compound there is no mention at all of @entity17 's plot to use liquid explosives to bring down as many as seven @entity11 , @entity174 and @entity175 passenger planes flying from @entity176 in 2006			1
if this plot had succeeded it might have rivaled 9/11 as a spectacular attack			0
@entity1 moved into his @entity5 compound either at the end of 2005 or sometime in 2006 and an administration official says that , perhaps , information about the @entity176 plot " got lost in the move			0
