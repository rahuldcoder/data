@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 knows you hate them			1
they know you do n't get their makeup , that you 've never heard their songs on the radio , that their fans do n't look or act like anybody else 's			1
they 're ok with that			0
actually , they kind of love it			0
" we may never be understood till we 're dead and gone , " @entity14 , known as @entity14 , said last month , sitting among stacks of vinyl in the band 's warehouse outside @entity19			1
" once we 're gone , people will take a look at the whole picture and say , ' what the f * * * was that ? ' " for now , though , they 're not ok with anybody taunting or discriminating against their fans , known as @entity30			1
@entity3 founders @entity14 and @entity31 , or @entity31 , announced last weekend they plan to file a lawsuit against the @entity33 for labeling their fans a gang			1
they made the announcement during the @entity36 , an annual music festival that draws thousands of @entity3 fans to rural @entity39 , @entity40			1
watch : @entity3 to sue @entity33 " this is the government 's way of telling us what you can listen to , what you can wear , " @entity14 told a crowd in a video posted online			1
" they 're telling you that ' if you listen to this music and you support this music , you are going to be committing a crime in our eyes			1
' " an @entity3 spokeswoman said the band 's lawyers are deciding how to proceed , but they are asking @entity30 to visit @entity58 to report " any negative consequence with an employer or governmental representative , including law enforcement , border patrol , airline security , or other local , state or federal governmental agency or employee as a result of their status as a @entity30			1
" the @entity33 called @entity30 a " hybrid gang " in its 2011 @entity72 , a designation @entity3 's members call " insanely ridiculous			1
" the report mentions a january 2011 case in which a " suspected @entity30 member " shot a couple in @entity78 , @entity79 , and a january 2010 case in which two " suspected @entity30 associates " beat and robbed an elderly man			1
" most crimes committed by @entity30 are sporadic , disorganized , individualistic , and often involve simple assault , personal drug use and possession , petty theft , and vandalism , " the @entity33 report said			1
" however , open source reporting suggests that a small number of @entity30 are forming more organized subsets and engaging in more gang - like criminal activity , such as felony assaults , thefts , robberies , and drug sales			1
" that 's not how @entity14 and @entity31 see it : " at any of our shows , it 's all love , total strangers high - fiving , " @entity14 said			1
" it 's the camaraderie that ca n't be defined or explained			2
" the @entity3 founders have seen their fans act out			1
at the @entity109 , @entity30 lobbed rocks and bottles at singer and former @entity114 model @entity113 , leaving her bloodied and bruised			1
@entity31 and @entity14 take some of the blame ; they say they should n't have invited her to the @entity36 , and when they realized how negative the reaction would be , they asked her not to take the stage			1
@entity113 was injured , they said , because she insulted the @entity30 , then would n't leave the stage			1
even after the onslaught of press coverage that followed , they do not blame their fans			2
from the archives : @entity113 wants to end juggalos gathering " juggalos come from all walks of life , man , " @entity14 said			1
" this is an acquired taste , what we do			0
we 're not on the radio			0
it 's not something where you 're going to pull up at a red light and the dude next to you is going to be bumping our s * * * , too ... our fans like a little background , a little story			1
they do n't want to see us wearing what they 're wearing			0
they want to see us jump out with fire and f * * * * * * strobe lights and confetti			0
" they bought a ticket , they want to see the circus			0
" starting in the 1990s , the self - dubbed " scrubs " quietly amassed a devoted following of fans that spans ages and backgrounds			2
if there 's a common theme among them , it 's this : the fans were outsiders who finally found a community in the hip - hop , wrestling , @entity168 pop - loving pack of ' los and ' lettes			1
they rely on their label , @entity171 , and the devotion of their fans , to advertise and distribute their music			2
news of the possible lawsuit came days before the release of the band 's new album , " @entity186 , " a multiyear effort with editions that include cover tunes that originated with @entity183 , @entity184 and " @entity185 ! " " we 're really high on things right now , not substance - ly high			2
we 're high on ourselves right now , " @entity14 said			2
" i know we 're a joke to the mainstream world , but the love we get from our fans is solid and real			2
" they say the new album is their best work , an album of songs that took years to write and record			2
with so many fans , it 's not the same as it was in the early years when they boasted and lied about who they were and what they were about			2
they ca n't even remember why , only that they saw themselves more as actors than artists			0
they still love wrestling and rap , but they started getting real about a message after @entity14 's 2003 autobiography , " behind the paint , " a book he said exposed the dark truths about divorce , abuse , poverty and drugs in his life			1
" we came from broken homes , but it almost feels stupid to sit here and talk about that because we had a great childhood , " @entity14 said			2
" my childhood was incredibly awesome , filled with imagination , fun , adventure ... " " backyard wrestling , " @entity31 added			0
from the archives : @entity238 heckled by @entity30 " the poorer i was , " @entity14 continued , " that made me who i am today			1
nowadays , it does n't take a lot to impress me because i never had s * * * , you know what i mean ? " " we got to be broke as you can possibly be together , and we got to appreciate everything that happened since then together ... not a day goes by we do n't sit there and analyze this , and say , ' man , you know , we 're living our dream			0
' " we still get to hang out with the same people we hung out with when we were 15 and 16			0
they work in this building			0
we get to travel the world with them			0
and most people you know , they have their high school years , their college people , and after that , they become family people			0
that 's all gravy , but they ca n't say they do n't dream about what it was like when they were running around with all their friends			2
" after 20 years , they said they 're just hitting their stride			0
they 're sober , and never got into hard drugs , they said , but both talked about medication to stabilize their moods , to keep the pressure from overwhelming them , to keep them away from bad habits from the past			0
" i love coming up here and doing what we do , then i love going home , " @entity31 said , holding an electronic cigarette			0
" it 's such a blessed life			0
" they say they 'll keep going " till the wheels fall off			0
" " some people listening actually give a f * * * about what we have to say and that feels good			0
i ca n't front about that			0
it feels good to have people care what 's on your mind , " @entity14 said			1
" we get to rock stages			0
i 've f * * * * * some beautiful women in my life			0
straight up , two or three chicks at once			0
who gets to do that s * * * , man ? especially scrubs ? " want to see the real @entity3 ? you must watch the video			2
