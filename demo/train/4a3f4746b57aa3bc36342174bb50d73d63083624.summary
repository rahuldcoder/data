@entity0 -- @entity3 's new leaders , just one year in their posts , will meet in @entity0 this weekend for the @entity5 of the @entity7 's central committee			1
@entity3 watchers will be looking closely to see if this plenum becomes a launchpad for major new reforms , as the meetings have in the past			1
but in @entity0 's streets and office buildings , the conclave prompts little enthusiasm			2
" those things do n't really interest me , " shrugged a white - collar employee , walking off for lunch in a sprawling mall lined with shops selling luxury goods			2
" i do n't have time for such topics			2
" his lackadaisical attitude is excusable			0
plenums are typically opaque ; held behind closed doors			1
i remember covering past plenums in the 1980s and 1990s			1
it involved guesswork and tea - leaf reading			2
i 'd look for tell - tale signs -- like an unusually large number of government - issue cars parked inside a government guesthouse -- just to confirm that the plenum had convened			2
at least now , the official media announces the dates beforehand			0
@entity42 locked out this time , as in the past , the media is still not invited			1
no live - streaming , no microblogging , no press briefings			0
yet , the potential impact of the plenum 's decisions will be hard to ignore			0
virtually every aspect of @entity3 's three - decade - old market reforms -- and their unintended consequences -- are up for review			1
a " plenum " is simply an assembly or meeting of members -- in this case , the political elite of the @entity7			1
with over 80 million members , the @entity7 , in effect , directs a bureaucracy the size of a several armies			1
near the tip of its pyramid - like power structure sits the central committee , with over 350 members and alternates selected once every five years			0
although the central committee meets infrequently -- about three or four times a year -- it is still the country 's highest policy - making body			1
it serves as a kind of parliament of the party			0
it formally approves important decisions on policy and personnel matters			0
most of its members hold top positions in the party , government and military			0
@entity91 power - brokers many past plenums have been largely ceremonial , with important decisions debated and made by the party 's 25 - member politburo beforehand			1
but on occasion , plenums have been witness to robust debates and sweeping decisions on party and government policies			0
an example of this was the plenum held in @entity0 in december 1978 , at which @entity3 formally adopted a policy of opening up and reform			1
@entity3 as we now know was conceived at that meeting , which came just two years after the death of @entity112 and the end of the @entity114			1
with new leader @entity116 at the helm , the plenum approved rural reforms that allowed farmers to sell a portion of their produce directly to the market , rather than farm their land collectively			0
in a short time , it dramatically raised standards of living			0
all told , the 1978 plenum paved the way for fundamental changes : decentralization , rewarding hard work and discouraging egalitarianism and rejecting ideological dogmatism			0
but few observers expect such far - reaching changes this time around			1
@entity137 , political science professor at @entity138 , says opposition from @entity7 conservatives and vested interests may still be too strong			2
" in my view ... @entity143 should not be strong enough so soon after taking power to pull off a major reform , " he said			0
still , @entity3 's leaders will unveil some economic reforms even if there is no sweeping policy package , said @entity150 , @entity151 of the @entity152 at @entity153 - sometimes called the @entity154 of @entity3			1
" the @entity3 economy is like a race car making a turn			2
you want to be very focused to stay on course and maintain constant speed , " he said			0
" if you slam on the brake while turning , you may easily lose control and get into trouble			0

past @entity7 plenums have been launchpads for major reforms
they take place in *secrecy* ; behind closed doors
observers looking for clues about @entity3 's *future* direction
few expect far - reaching policy changes this time around
