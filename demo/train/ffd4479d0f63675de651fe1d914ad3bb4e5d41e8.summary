secretary of state @entity15 issued a direct challenge to @entity5 president @entity4 tuesday , warning that he and his government " will be held responsible for every single death that occurs in " the refugee camps of the @entity20 region			1
@entity4 ordered the expulsion of 13 international aid groups from the @entity24 earlier this month after he was indicted by the @entity25 on charges of war crimes			1
while other aid groups remain in @entity24 , the @entity28 said the 13 expelled groups provided roughly half the assistance delivered in @entity20			1
nearly 300,000 people have died in the @entity20 conflict , and millions are homeless , according to the @entity28 calling the situation in @entity20 " horrendous , " @entity35 said president @entity38 's administration will appoint a special envoy for @entity24 " in the coming days			1
" on wednesday , retired air force gen. @entity40 was appointed as @entity43 special envoy for @entity24 , the @entity41 announced in a written statement			2
" @entity24 is a priority for this administration , particularly at a time when it cries out for peace and for justice			2
the worsening humanitarian crisis there makes our task all the more urgent , " president @entity38 said in the statement			0
" @entity56 's personal and professional background , and his service to the country as both a military leader and a humanitarian , give him the insights and experience necessary for this assignment			0
" @entity40 , a former fighter pilot , served as assistant deputy undersecretary of the @entity63 for international affairs			0
fluent in @entity66 , he was raised partly in @entity67 , where his parents were missionary teachers @entity35 said the real question now is what kind of pressure can be brought to bear on @entity4 and the government in @entity73 to make them understand " that they will be held responsible for every single death that occurs in those camps			1
" @entity2 spokesman @entity78 told reporters , " it 's just a catastrophe that @entity4 has created			1
we 're going to continue to make this case and we 're imploring others to make this case that he needs to reverse that decision he took			2
thousands , hundreds of thousands of people , could possibly be at risk and it 's irresponsible , the action he took , and he needs to reverse it and reverse it immediately			2
people 's lives are at risk			1
" @entity35 said countries that support @entity4 's expulsion order " have the responsibility to persuade the government in @entity24 to change its decision to let the aid workers back , or they must replace with money and personnel those who have been expelled so that innocent lives are not lost and further undermined			1
" @entity35 said the @entity43 is " very concerned " and is looking for more effective ways to convince the @entity5 government that " they have assumed an even greater sense of responsibility and infamy in the eyes of the world by turning their backs on these refugees whom they created in the first place			0
" @entity78 said it is clear that @entity4 is the sole person at fault			0
" @entity4 is to blame for this crisis on the ground , " he said			0
his actions have only made things a lot worse			0
we are trying to get him to reverse this decision			0
we want to call on all those who have influence with the government of @entity24 , institutions like the @entity130 , the @entity131 , to do what they can to get @entity4 to reverse his decision			1
" @entity38 , during his election campaign , made the crisis in @entity20 a major focus			0
since then , some have criticized him for putting it on the back burner			0
seeking to rebut that view , @entity78 listed all recent steps the administration has taken to resolve the situation			0
last week , he said , @entity38 discussed the deteriorating situation in @entity24 with @entity28 secretary general @entity148			0
@entity43 officials have been meeting in @entity150 , @entity0 and @entity73 with delegations from what @entity78 called " like - minded nations			0
" last weekend , the @entity43 charge d'affaires in @entity24 met with @entity155 ( the @entity130 / @entity28 operation in @entity20 ) and visited a camp for internally displaced people			2
and last week in @entity150 , @entity28 ambassador @entity159 spoke with the president of @entity24 and the @entity5 ambassador to the @entity28 @entity78 said the @entity43 has been reaching out to the @entity131 , the @entity130 and other countries with influence on @entity24 , trying to convince them the decision to expel some aid groups " not only costs lives but serves to further isolate the country			1
" asked whether the @entity43 supports a move to defer the @entity25 indictment of @entity4 , @entity78 said it does not support " any deferral			2
