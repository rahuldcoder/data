-- for a while , it happened only every few years or so			2
now , there rarely is a month , week or day that passes without a big - time program in college football sprinting deep into scandal while daring the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) to tackle it			1
the @entity9 is just the latest team on the verge of drawing penalty flags from @entity8 officials for unnecessary silliness			1
in fact , the @entity14 could draw the ultimate penalty in college football , called the death penalty			1
the @entity8 only considers giving such a penalty to a university facing a second major violation within five years or dealing with a particularly outrageous situation			0
@entity23 : why @entity8 would n't give @entity9 the death penalty that was the case for @entity26 , whose football program was banned for two seasons during the 1980s			1
no other program ever has received the death penalty , but there is rampant speculation that @entity9 could be the second			1
the @entity14 reportedly had dozens of past and former players spend a stretch from 2002 to 2010 receiving illegal gifts and other things from @entity39 , a convicted @entity40 schemer and @entity9 booster			1
@entity42 broke the story after 100 hours of jailhouse interviews with @entity39 , who pleaded guilty to robbing investors of around $ 83 million in his @entity46 of $ 930 million			1
@entity42 also reported that several @entity9 coaches and administrators tried to cover up the matter			1
among other revelations , @entity39 told the website that he spent " millions " on @entity9 players , ranging from sex parties on his yacht to expensive jewelry to an abortion for a woman impregnated by a @entity58 player			1
the @entity9 situation is so egregious that @entity8 president @entity61 issued the following statement : " if the assertions are true , the conduct at the @entity9 is an illustration of the need for serious and fundamental change in many critical aspects of college sports			1
" if this sounds familiar , it should			0
along the @entity14 ' way to five national championships from 1983 through 2001 , they flaunted their bad - boy image while ducking in and out of the @entity8 slammer for rules violations			2
the @entity9 program crumbled after that			2
@entity23 : the @entity8 system is broken ; here 's how to fix it then , to hear these reports tell it , the @entity14 tried to revive their glory days through shortcuts			0
they are n't alone with those shortcuts			0
those are just some of the other big - time college football programs in the news for stuff other than blocking and tackling			1
they 've been mentioned more regarding cheating and scheming			0
just take it from @entity102 , the award - winning college football analyst for @entity104 , who told @entity0 , " i honestly do n't think the sport has ever had as tumultuous of an off - season as we had during this year			1
i do mean , ever , and i 'm referring to the entire history of the sport			0
" through it all , with @entity8 enforcement people looking more powerless than @entity112 from those old @entity114 sitcoms , there have been sordid tales involving automobiles , houses and even prostitutes			0
there have been recruiting violations -- gigantic ones -- of all shapes , sizes and situations			0
there have been cover - ups and alleged cover - ups , ranging from coaching staffs to the highest levels of universities			2
mostly , there has been no reason to believe things will improve in big - time college football before the end of the millennium			1
" i just think the leadership groups -- including coaches , people who care about the sport at the end of the day -- have got to come up with some ideas and brainstorming ways on how to police this , " said @entity102 , a former quarterback at @entity88 , where its last quarterback , @entity138 , was among those who helped place the school under its current @entity8 investigation for a slew of things			0
@entity150 was forced to resign as head coach despite leading @entity88 to six @entity153 titles , a national championship and eight victories out nine games against despised rival @entity157			0
the thing is , even though @entity88 volunteered to " vacate " its 12 victories last season while submitting to a two - year probation -- in addition to whatever else the @entity8 may impose this fall -- the @entity163 remain a powerhouse in the @entity153			2
they also continue to rank among the top recruiters in college football			1
they have little to no incentive not to thumb their noses again at the @entity8 cops			0
added @entity102 , " that 's why we have to figure out how to try to get college football back to people in charge who generally care about the health of the game and not just about churning kids out to get them ready for the @entity181			1
that 's not what college football is all about			1
" as for reality , when it comes to the big boys , college football really is about teams acquiring as many @entity181 - caliber players as possible to help them with the bottom line -- winning			1
winning big by any means necessary			0
which raises a question : for the sake of that bottom line , are more than a few college football programs ( and their conferences , for that matter ) deciding to suffer the consequences of cheating on purpose these days ? after all , winning means money , and the money associated with teams and conferences winning consistently in the @entity8 's so - called @entity205 ( formerly known as @entity205 ) is huge			1
the @entity206 is in the midst of a $ 2.2 billion contract with @entity104			2
during the last two seasons of the @entity211 , each conference school received slightly more than $ 6 million			0
the @entity212 is joining @entity213 with its own television network , and the payouts for both contracts could slice chunks from the national debt			0
if you combine those tv examples with the @entity8 setting another record for football attendance last year , the money / incentive for the big boys to continue as bad boys regarding @entity8 rules is outrageous			2
according to the @entity227 , the @entity226 ( @entity226 ) distributed more than $ 174 million earlier this year to teams that played in its five bowls			0
the @entity227 also said the payout was a 22 percent increase over last year 's total , and consider this : the conferences receiving the most money -- $ 27.2 million each , for having two teams apiece in @entity226 games -- were the @entity153 , @entity238 and @entity206 ( @entity206 )			0
@entity23 : this is more than a @entity9 problem some of the biggest scandals of the last few months have involved teams from those conferences			2
there is @entity89 , for instance , and the @entity246 are the latest in a string of five consecutive teams from the @entity206 to win the national championship			0
they did so with @entity251 - winning quarterback @entity250 spending his one year at @entity89 battling opponents and reports that his father sought as much as $ 180,000 from schools for rights to his son			2
the @entity8 allowed @entity250 to continue to play , but they say the investigation is n't closed			0
so did @entity89 know about @entity250 's issues , ignore them and use his considerable talents for the sake of now instead of the future ? only @entity89 officials know , but this is for sure : members of the @entity266 always can say their folks whipped @entity91 on the field last season for its first national championship since 1957			2
you know , that bottom line .			0

the @entity9 is being investigated over claims made by an *ex-booster*
@entity39 told @entity42 he spent millions on improper gifts for @entity9 players
@entity9 joins a long list of college football programs who have faced *similar* allegations
@entity104 calls the college football off - season " tumultuous "
