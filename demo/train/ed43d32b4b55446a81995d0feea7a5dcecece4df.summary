@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 people need to know that @entity4 troops will not still be fighting in @entity1 in 2025 , @entity7 chief @entity6 said , but the @entity4 ' relationship with that country will be a long - term one			1
gates and @entity1 president @entity12 spoke after the two met thursday			1
" @entity4 will still be here after july 2011 , " the defense secretary said			2
" the president has been very clear that that is the beginning of a process , and the pace will be determined by conditions on the ground in @entity1			2
" but , he said , " the @entity4 people need to know we are not still going to be fighting this fight 15 years from now			2
" " that said , the reality is we are looking at a long - term relationship with @entity1 , and we have the confidence that the progress we are making jointly with our @entity1 partners and our other allies will allow us to begin a transition to @entity1 security control within the next year			1
" @entity12 , he said , has indicated he believes his country will be ready to accept full security control in 2014			1
" we learned our lesson in turning our back on @entity1 ion 1989 and we have no intention of doing it again , " he said , referring to the support the @entity4 provided @entity1 during their lengthy battle with @entity37 troops -- that disappeared when @entity37 withdrew			1
@entity11 ' visit came on the same day that a @entity46 airstrike killed 10 people in the country 's northeast			0
a provincial official said those killed were parliamentary campaign workers , but @entity46 and @entity4 officials said the precision airstrike targeted a senior member of an insurgent group			1
@entity46 is investigating the incident			0
@entity12 has issued pointed criticism at the coalition for civilian casualties during warfare , including this latest incident , which comes a little more than two weeks ahead of the parliamentary elections			1
" the reports that we get so far are 10 killed and three wounded in this operation , " @entity12 said in a joint appearance with @entity6 after their meeting			1
he added that a parliamentary candidate was wounded in the attack and that an investigation was under way			1
" i have limited knowledge of the strike at this point , " @entity6 said			0
" i believe i can confirm that a very senior official of the @entity79 movement of @entity80 was the target and was killed			0
this was an individual who was responsible for organizing attacks here in @entity0 and in northern @entity1			0
this is the first i heard that civilians may have been killed , and we will certainly look into that			0
" @entity11 ' trip comes a day after he visited @entity91 , where he attended a change of command ceremony that marked the end of the @entity4 combat mission there			0
@entity12 defended his government 's decision to kick private security companies out of the country in four months			2
" on the issue of the private security firms , the decision of the @entity1 government is final and conclusive , " he said			2
" the presence of security firms is not only adding to the problems of corruption in @entity1 , the problems of lawlessness in @entity1 and lots of other affectations ... but they 're also running a parallel structure to the @entity1 government			2
we will not have an effective growth of @entity1 security forces " with the private firms still operational			1
" we can not sustain them any more in our country , and i 'm glad to say the @entity4 backs this decision with us			0
" gen. @entity122 , the top @entity4 military man in @entity1 , said initial approaches to some @entity125 members as part of a reconciliation initiative have shown promise and could help in the effort to resolve the conflict there			1
@entity122 , who heads the @entity4 and @entity46 - led forces in @entity1 , spoke to reporters after greeting @entity6 , who arrived in the war - torn country thursday to consult with political and military officials			1
@entity122 said there have already been approaches toward @entity125 officials at senior levels that hold some promise			0
this comes amid discussions about reaching out to some @entity125 members as part of a reconciliation process , but the military is n't envisioning peace talks with hard - liners			0
@entity122 also addressed a number of other issues , such as the community police plan , which he described as basically " community watch with @entity154 , under a @entity156 chain of command " so there are n't concerns about warlords or militias			0
" this will not be @entity164 in @entity1 , " he said , referring to anti-al @entity162 groups in @entity91			0
he also said that since the departure earlier this summer of gen. @entity166 -- who was forced to step down after he made controversial comments about members of the @entity171 administration in a magazine article -- there has been " a change in personnel , not in overall concept " in the @entity1 mission .			0
