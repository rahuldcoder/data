-- a man who has been fighting for permanent custody of his daughter under @entity5 tribal law can continue to raise her for the moment in @entity8 , a new twist in a high - profile legal case already decided by the @entity11			1
the @entity12 issued an emergency stay on friday to temporarily delay the transfer of @entity16 's daughter , @entity15 , 4 , to her adoptive parents in @entity18			1
the order was made public on tuesday			0
attorneys for @entity16 and the adoptive couple , @entity22 and @entity23 of @entity24 , planned to attend a closed - door hearing at the @entity12 later on tuesday			2
it is unclear when that court would issue a ruling on custody			0
in june , a divided @entity30 @entity11 sided with @entity31 when @entity16 sought to assert his parental rights			1
they had legally adopted her when she was a baby			0
the justices said the adoption was proper and did not intrude on the federal rights of the father , a registered member of the @entity39 tribe , over where his daughter would live			1
the court said @entity16 could not rely on the @entity41 for relief because he never had legal or physical custody at the time of adoption proceedings , which were initiated by the birth mother without his knowledge			1
birth father arrested in ' @entity15 ' adoption fight broad legal implications the case raises issues about the scope of a special federal law aimed at keeping @entity5 families together			1
it also put at odds competing orders from courts in two states			0
@entity18 judges in recent weeks had finalized the adoption back to the @entity31 , who are white			0
following the @entity11 order , a family court in @entity18 developed a " transition plan " to ease any transfer , taking into account the girl 's age , sensitivities of the parties involved , and native american heritage dynamic underlying the larger legal dispute			1
@entity16 refused to turn the child over and was cited for contempt			2
a warrant was issued on august 10 for " custodial interference			0
" the father then took his case to @entity83 courts			1
the @entity84 originally ruled for @entity16			2
the adoptive couple has said separation from @entity15 has been difficult			0
" we are looking forward to seeing her again soon when we have the opportunity to do so , because we miss her so very much , " said @entity23			0
@entity91 , @entity15 's birth mother , also expressed satisfaction when the high court ruled in june			2
" @entity22 and @entity23 are part of my family , and they have treated me like part of theirs			0
i 'm hopeful that we will all be reunited with @entity15 very soon , " the statement said			0
groups hopeful for father @entity5 groups had remained hopeful @entity16 would maintain custody			1
several parties have a stake in the outcome			0
these include the biological and adoptive parents , the federal government , the @entity8 - based tribe , and a legal guardian appointed by the state to represent the child 's interests			1
@entity16 had earlier signed a legal document agreeing to put the girl up for adoption , but his attorneys said he did not understand the extent of the waiver and that the birth mother misrepresented the child 's @entity125 heritage to social service workers when the adoption was finalized			1
at issue was whether @entity16 , as the onetime non-custodial father , could gain parental custody , after the @entity133 mother initiated an adoption outside the tribe			1
a special congressional law governs such interstate adoptions , since the current 556 federally recognized - tribes all fall under @entity140 oversight , giving those tribes certain unique benefits and rights			0
the @entity23 's lawyers had argued federal law does not define an unwed biological father as a " parent			2
" opinion : should race be a factor in adoption ? relinquished parental rights the @entity41 was a response to decades of often abusive social service practices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of native youngsters from their families , in many cases to non-native @entity30 homes			2
the legislation was designed to " promote the stability and security of @entity125 tribes and @entity125 families by the establishment of minimum federal standards to prevent the arbitrary removal of @entity125 children from their families and tribes and to ensure that measures which prevent the breakup of @entity125 families are followed in child custody proceedings			0
" @entity16 's relationship within the " federally recognized government " of the @entity178 means @entity15 is a member of the tribe and subject to its jurisdiction			1
" it 's not anyone 's intent ever to rip a child away from a loving home , " said @entity182 , the @entity183 , @entity8 - based tribe 's attorney general			2
" but we want to make sure those loving homes have the opportunity to be @entity125 homes first			0
" but @entity16 argued he successfully established paternity under state law , and qualified as a " parent " under the tribal statute , thereby giving him proper control and custody of his daughter			1
he agreed to relinquish his parental rights in exchange for not paying child support , but said the mother never indicated she intended unilaterally to give the child up for adoption			0
and @entity16 claims the biological mother tried to " conceal " his @entity125 heritage during the adoption process with the @entity31 .			2

@entity83 court issues stay of transfer of girl from father to adoptive parents
@entity16 fights to keep daughter even though @entity30 @entity11 ruled adoption was proper
@entity16 is member of @entity39 tribe and has based legal case on @entity5 law
