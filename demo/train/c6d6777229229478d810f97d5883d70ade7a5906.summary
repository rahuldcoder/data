-- ever hopped in a taxi and sat in traffic for hours whilst pedestrians and cyclists sailed past your window ? if so , you may wondered whether you 're part of the problem and not the solution			0
as public transport networks continue to improve in many @entity12 cities , taxis remain a common mode of getting around			1
but for @entity15 , there must be a better way			0
the @entity12 entrepreneur has developed @entity18 -- electric three - wheeled vehicles designed for eco-friendly and efficient transportation in urban areas			1
@entity0 's @entity23 caught up with @entity15 to talk travel , business and starting up in @entity12			1
an edited version of the interview follows			0
@entity0 : what got you thinking about changing the taxi concept ? @entity31 : the departure point was when i learned 80 % of all urban trips are less than four kilometers			1
globally , taxi rides are fairly short and it 's really inefficient to use a traditional taxi for these journeys			2
efficiencies that can come with a small vehicle are enormous and passenger savings would be enormous			2
@entity0 : what stage of development is @entity44 at ? @entity45 : we built eight prototype cars and did a lot of testing -- we tested brakes , lights , everything			0
after the test , we basically wanted to re-design the entire vehicle and took the prototypes off the road			1
we are now at the stage of building chassis and want to be on @entity12 roads in the first quarter of 2015			1
@entity0 : you say these vehicles are designed for urban areas			0
where are you targeting in @entity12 and beyond ? @entity45 : we already have demand from advertisers for 60 vehicles in the @entity69 [ the @entity12 province where @entity71 is located ]			1
after that , we will focus on @entity73 -- @entity12 's province where @entity75 and @entity76 are located			1
beyond that a big mobile phone company in @entity78 is interested too and we are considering an initial focus on @entity80			1
but this could go beyond @entity12 too			1
we have had talks about a project in @entity84 and other cities in @entity86			1
@entity0 : how safe will traveling in these vehicles be ? @entity45 : we have developed ultra-rigid roll cage , safety belts and proximity sensors for the vehicles and some will be fitted with doors			0
i also recognize there are some security issues in @entity12			1
in very slow moving traffic , there is a risk of bag - snatching			2
passengers will be able to use lockable baggage areas underneath the seat to keep property safe			0
and we are also looking at some vehicles to be fitted with a @entity106 camera			0
@entity0 : how much will it cost for a normal journey ? @entity45 : the goal is to make each ride 15 - 20 rand ( less than $ 2 ) per ride , irrespective of distance traveled			2
we want a @entity112 ride to be way , way cheaper than traditional taxis			1
normal taxis in @entity12 are 8rand per kilometer in a flagged ride , plus 15 rand for " flag fall			1
" i recently took a 15 kilometer taxi ride north of @entity71 , and it cost 370 rand ( $ 33 )			0
we want @entity120 to be much cheaper for the passenger and for the operator too			1
passengers will be able to pay cash or through an app. @entity0 : will all @entity126 be driven by employees , or can people hire them for self - drive ? @entity45 : all drivers will be permanently employed staff -- there 's more than enough people looking for quality work around here			0
i want to build up a team of really strong drivers			0
we 're putting successful drivers through a formal tour - guide training course , which will benefit not only us , but ideally develop them into small business owners later on			0
we 're also equipping them with communication and client interaction courses			0
what we 're also thinking of doing is transferring ownership of the vehicles to the drivers after a period of successful operation ... enabling them to become semi-owner drivers			0
@entity0 : where is the funding coming from ? @entity45 : at the moment , the @entity12 government is not involved			1
they have promised to get involved in the future , but i 'm not sure i want that			0
at the moment , the funding comes from a @entity12 venture capital fund , and i own the majority of the shares			1
there is one other investor -- it 's [ been ] almost three years of playing around with different transport ideas			0
@entity0 : why have you decided to start in @entity12 -- is it a good country for entrepreneurs ? @entity45 : as far as @entity12 goes , @entity12 is ideal -- we have good infrastructure and good internet connectivity			2
but we should all start thinking outside of @entity12			2
there 's quite a lot of demand outside of @entity12 for @entity12 products			2
traditionally , there was a very old school mindset -- @entity12 was a very isolated market			2
now things are happening , a lot of good opportunities and focus on startups			0
@entity0 : is the government doing enough to encourage innovation ? @entity45 : the @entity12 government could get much more involved in developing entrepreneurs			2
i 'd love them to get more involved particularly with funding			0
there is funding available for entrepreneurs , but it 's practically impossible			0
it 's really difficult to access the funding from @entity12 government			2

@entity120 is a three - wheeled vehicle that the owner says is more efficient than traditional taxis
