@entity0 -- president @entity2 expressed deep concern on wednesday about the @entity6 military 's removal of that nation 's first democratically elected president , calling for a quick return to civilian leadership and ordering a review of @entity13 law regarding aid to the vital @entity16 ally			1
" the @entity13 continues to believe firmly that the best foundation for lasting stability in @entity6 is a democratic political order with participation from all sides and all political parties , " @entity2 said in a statement about the move to oust @entity19 a year after he took office			1
@entity2 said the @entity13 expects the military to " ensure the rights " of @entity6 citizens " during this uncertain period			1
" he also called on the military to avoid " arbitrary arrests " of @entity19 and his supporters			2
but @entity19 and most members of his leadership team were under house arrest , according to the @entity37			0
@entity2 's written statement followed a meeting of national security officials , including defense secretary @entity41 , @entity43 chairman gen. @entity42 and cia director @entity44 at the @entity45 , and illustrated a complex diplomatic situation			0
the run - up to @entity19 's removal included huge demonstrations on both sides of the political equation , with millions of people flooding @entity54 squares in scenes similar to the mass protests and unrest that led to the military coup that toppled longtime leader @entity59 in 2011			1
@entity2 refused to choose sides then and his administration adopted a similarly neutral stance ahead of the military 's decision on wednesday to suspend the constitution and remove @entity19 , who left the @entity37 after his election in a symbolic gesture as leader of all @entity6			1
the head of @entity6 's @entity70 will serve as interim president			2
the @entity2 administration said earlier in the day @entity6 deserved a " peaceful political solution			2
" but @entity75 spokeswoman @entity74 also noted that @entity19 had failed to outline " significant specific steps " to address the concerns of anti-government protesters			0
tricky policy scenario for @entity13 the situation in @entity54 created an uncomfortable policy scenario for a @entity13 government and president that champion democratic principles			0
@entity2 reinforced that in his statement			0
" i now call on the @entity6 military to move quickly and responsibly to return full authority back to a democratically elected civilian government as soon as possible through an inclusive and transparent process , " he said			1
" the goal of any political process should be a government that respects the rights of all people , majority and minority ; that institutionalizes the checks and balances upon which democracy depends ; and that places the interests of the people above party or faction , " he added , noting that those protesting @entity19 's government must be heard			2
but he also raised the tricky issue of military aid to @entity6 , which also was noted by members of @entity110 in their reaction to events			2
@entity6 unrest : 5 key questions @entity6 's 1973 peace treaty with @entity116 and responsibility for keeping open the vital oil shipping lane of the @entity119 make it an important player in the region regarding @entity13 interests			1
@entity124 sen. @entity123 of @entity125 noted that the more than $ 1 billion a year in military aid to @entity6 would be cut off if @entity19 's overthrow is deemed a military coup			1
@entity13 law restricts some kinds of aid to countries where the elected head of government is deposed by a military coup , or a coup in which the military plays a decisive role			1
@entity2 , who did not use the word " coup " in his statement , directed " relevant departments and agencies " to review the implications for aid to @entity6			1
@entity145 : stop using @entity13 taxpayer money to aid @entity19 @entity42 told @entity1 before wednesday 's announcement in @entity6 that " there will be consequences " if the situation was " badly handled			1
" " if this were to be seen as a coup , then it would limit our ability to have the kind of relationship we need with the @entity6 armed forces , " @entity42 said			0
in a separate interview with @entity1 , former @entity75 official @entity159 noted that the military 's announcement included non-military figures from civil society to portray it as a broader political step than a military coup			2
" there 's something different happening here , " said @entity159 , a former assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs			0
he said the situation " creates the possibility for a political transition in @entity6 to a pluralistic government system			0
" initial statements from congressional @entity175 who usually seize on any opportunity to criticize @entity2 policies were cautiously supportive of @entity19 's ouster			1
" i am hopeful that his departure will reopen the path to a better future for @entity6 , and i encourage the military and all political parties to cooperate in the peaceful establishment of democratic institutions and new elections that lead to an @entity6 where minority rights are protected , " said a statement by @entity175 rep. @entity180 of @entity181 , who chairs the @entity182			2
" but make no mistake about it , @entity6 is in for very difficult days			0
" a vital @entity13 ally unrest in @entity6 erupted as part of the @entity197 wave of uprisings that began in @entity199 in 2010			2
the situation in @entity6 has been a political thorn for @entity2 , forcing him to balance the interests of @entity116 with a @entity13 desire to promote democratic values in the mostly @entity206 region			1
opinion : @entity2 missed out on @entity197 before @entity19 's election , @entity2 announced efforts to help @entity6 stabilize and modernize its economy , including debt relief of up to $ 1 billion and another $ 1 billion in loan guarantees			1
@entity19 's ascendency benefited @entity2 a few months later , when @entity19 played a key role in negotiating a cease - fire between @entity216 and @entity116 following eight days of @entity218 violence last november			1
but @entity19 subsequently issued an order preventing any @entity6 court from overturning his decisions in what was considered an undemocratic move decried by opposition groups			2
within a month , he reinstated the judicial oversight and submitted a draft @entity227 - backed constitution that voters approved and he signed into law			0
what is the @entity37 ? public anger over economic woes and a lack of opposition voices in government helped spark the latest protests			0
@entity19 : fast facts @entity2 had called @entity19 the @entity45 said on tuesday that @entity2 had called @entity19 to urge him to show @entity6 that he understood their anger and to take political steps to resolve the crisis			1
the focus and tone of the @entity45 statement was similar to a year ago when @entity19 won @entity6 's first election following @entity59 's ouster			1
" we will stand with the @entity6 people as they pursue their aspirations for democracy , dignity , and opportunity , and fulfill the promise of their revolution , " the @entity45 said then			0
such a neutral approach has riled conservatives seeking a more assertive @entity13 role in the aftermath of the @entity197 uprisings that swept through parts of @entity199 and the @entity16 in recent years			0
@entity175 sen. @entity261 of @entity262 has criticized the president for yielding a leadership role in the region			0
shrinking @entity13 aid last month , he warned a shrinking @entity13 foreign aid budget meant " @entity6 must show that it is a good investment of our scarce resources -- that the return on this investment will be a freer , more democratic , more tolerant @entity6			1
" if not , @entity261 said in a speech on the @entity16 , " @entity110 will spend this money elsewhere			0
that is just a fact			0
" the @entity6 military this week gave @entity19 an ultimatum to work out a solution to the protests by wednesday			1
@entity19 responded by calling for creation of a temporary coalition government until early elections can take place in coming months			0
the statement posted wednesday on @entity19 's official @entity288 page warned that a coup would undermine the aspirations and achievements of the 2011 revolution			0
travel warning , evacuation the @entity13 @entity295 in @entity54 ordered the mandatory evacuation of all nonessential personnel , @entity1 's @entity298 reported , citing a senior administration official			0
separately , the @entity75 warned @entity13 to defer travel to @entity6 and @entity13 citizens living there to leave the country			2
@entity1 's @entity303 and @entity298 contributed to this report .			0
