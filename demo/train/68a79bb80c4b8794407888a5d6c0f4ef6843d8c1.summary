-- feminism 's gotten a bad rap lately			1
for many , even just the word itself conjures up images of radical ideology			1
pop music star @entity7 and @entity9 ceo @entity8 , to cite two famous examples , asserted that they 're pro-equality , but wo n't identify as feminists			0
explaining her position in february of this year , @entity13 noted that she did n't have the " militant drive " or " chip on her shoulder " that comes with feminism			1
i 'm not particularly militant , nor do i have a chip on my shoulder ( i hope ) , but i get my share of weird reactions nonetheless			0
see , not only am i feminist , i 'm a male feminist			1
people are n't always sure what to do with that			0
" you 're a man			0
is n't that a contradiction ? " " wait , are men allowed to be feminists ? " " are you even a man at all ? " as far as i know , men are absolutely allowed to be feminists			1
and when i declare that i 'm a feminist , i should explain what that word means to me			1
my feminism is a simple belief in equality			1
i 'm a feminist because i believe that men and women are and should be equal , but we 're not treated equally right now			1
we see it in a distorted conception of female beauty , we see it in dehumanizing portrayals of women in film and on television , and we see it when the response to rape all too often is n't support , but consists of loud cries of " she was asking for it ! " and " her skirt was really short ! " the basic sexism undergirding our world is so pervasive that i ( and others ) have grown up with it and see it at every stage of our lives			1
from the much - discussed pay gap to constant street harassment to denying of basic rights to women and girls , we see it everywhere			0
i 'll never forget the meeting i was in a few years ago because the visitors to our office never made eye contact with my female manager			0
i 'll wager that they thought , perhaps unconsciously , that because i was a man , i was the boss			0
as an incredibly junior staffer , that was a wildly inaccurate assumption			0
some counter that men and women used to be unequal , but we 're passed that			1
a few even foolishly assert that this increasing focus on equalizing the playing field has spelled the " end of men			1
" and there 's no doubt that we 've made progress : in area after area , in country after country , we can point to some concrete signs that with advocacy and hard work , we 're slowly getting closer to gender equality			0
but for many women , this progress does n't mean that sexism 's gone , it just means that it 's different			2
as @entity107 , writing for " @entity106 , " describes , for a lot of folks , sexism is n't a " deadly cancer [ anymore ] ; rather , it 's a steady low - grade fever that wears you down by degrees			2
" it 's the hostile work environment that makes you feel unwelcome , it 's the strange sports metaphors that do n't resonate with everyone equally , it 's the deferral to men as " authoritative " while women must still walk the line to avoid both being viewed as " passive " while not crossing over into " bossy " territory			2
and even though sexism does n't always cry out at the shrill pitch it once did , even though attacks on women can be increasingly subtle , men still have a crucial role to play			1
not only do we help create the inequality , gender norms , and messages that hurt and objectify women , but critically , we suffer from its barbs as well			0
in a world that blames victims of rape , not rapists , our societies fundamentally do n't value the humanity of half of us			0
in a world that pays women far less than men for the same work ( or denies women the opportunity to work at all ) , we ignore the possible contributions of countless leaders and entrepreneurs			2
hell , in a world that valorizes men who sleep around while shaming and seeking to control female sexual power , relationships of all kinds are stunted by false , inhuman understandings of who and what men and women are			2
sexism does n't just hurt women , it breaks our very humanity			2
and ultimately , that 's why i 'm a feminist			2
because women deserve to be treated as equal human beings , and it hurts every single one of us when that 's not the case			0
and until we get a more equal world , i 'll claim that title of " feminist " proudly and shout it from the rooftops			0
i 'll try not to get a chip on my shoulder , though			0
