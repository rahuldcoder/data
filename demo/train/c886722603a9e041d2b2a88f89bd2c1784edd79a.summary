@entity0 's " @entity6 " describes how @entity1 conspired to conquer the democracies , which were unwitting , unprepared and nearly defeated when the storm of @entity4 finally burst upon them			2
@entity11 stood alone for a time , the solitary champion of freedom in a new kind of war , fought with the revolutionary new technology of massed airpower , in the warring skies over the bombed homes of the heroic city			0
@entity17 went to the @entity18 and freedom prevailed over tyranny in @entity4 only because a handful of visionary statesmen , scientists and captains of industry prepared for the gathering storm			2
@entity0 and president @entity25 did what they could to prepare their reluctant nations to transition from peacetime to a war economy			2
rep. @entity32 , chairman of the @entity33 , insisted that a skeptical peacetime @entity35 build aircraft carriers			0
@entity37 and other pioneers of aviation , during the peace before @entity41 , designed fighters and bombers that won the air war			0
@entity46 , @entity47 and other nuclear physicists started the @entity49 down the path that became the @entity51 and beat the @entity52 to the atomic bomb			1
today , another gathering storm threatens freedom and the survival of civilization : cyberwarfare			0
terrorists and rogue states are making cyberattacks on a daily basis , using computer bugs to probe defenses of @entity49 critical infrastructures			1
the most important critical infrastructure is the electric power grid			1
electricity runs and makes possible the operation of all the other critical infrastructures -- communications , transportation , banking and finance , food and water -- that sustain modern civilization and the lives of millions			0
the biggest cyberthreat is from electromagnetic pulse , which in the military doctrines of potential adversaries would be part of an all - out cyberwar			1
a nuclear missile , perhaps launched from a freighter , detonated at high altitude over the @entity49 could black out the national grid for months or years , killing an estimated 90 % of @entity49 by starvation , disease and societal collapse			1
( and there is also a natural threat : the sun could inflict a worldwide natural @entity96 catastrophe with a solar flare that generates a rare geomagnetic superstorm , like the 1859 @entity99			2
such a storm could collapse electric grids everywhere on @entity102 , endangering billions			2
) statements made in @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 lend credence to the possibility of @entity96 attacks against the @entity49 @entity104 has practiced missile launches from a ship , and @entity105 has demonstrated its ability to launch a satellite			1
either of these platforms could be used to launch @entity96 attacks against the @entity49 with little warning			1
in july , a @entity105 freighter detained for drug smuggling was discovered to have nuclear - capable missiles aboard			0
in a vivid demonstration of the vulnerability of @entity49 infrastructure , in april , saboteurs using @entity122 attacked and damaged electric grid transformers near @entity127			1
the gathering cyberstorm draws near			0
although most @entity49 do not know it , @entity129 , like @entity11 during the storm of @entity4 , is at the center of the gathering cyberstorm that threatens the very existence of the @entity49			1
headquartered in @entity129 is the @entity135 , responsible for protecting the national power grid			0
a corporation proactively protecting the grid would be good for all @entity49			1
unfortunately , the corporation is not doing its job and has failed to accomplish the most important task of all : making preparations to protect @entity49 from a cybercatastrophe			1
six years ago , the @entity49 @entity145 ( @entity146 ) ordered the corporation to produce a plan to protect the electric grid from cyberbugs			1
the @entity135 still has no plan			0
the corporation flatly refuses to even try producing a plan for grid protection against the gravest cyberthreat , nuclear @entity96 attack , claiming that protection against such an attack is the job of the @entity160			1
in 2012 , the corporation wrote a report ( @entity146 ) that amounts to " junk science " in trying to deny that natural @entity96 is a catastrophic threat			0
members of @entity166 , in frustration with the corporation , are trying to pass the @entity169 , which would empower the @entity170 to order the corporation to protect the grid from @entity96			0
the state of @entity174 , also in frustration , recently passed a legislative initiative to protect its own grid from @entity96			0
meeting in @entity129 this week is the @entity177 , where all 50 states will be briefed on how they can protect their electric grids without waiting for the @entity135			2
that corporation should lead , follow or get out of the way of those who are trying to protect our nation from a cybercatastrophe			0
otherwise , the @entity166 that certified it as the electric reliability organization can also decertify it .			0

@entity191 : cyberwar is a tool being used by terrorists , rogue states
he says an electromagnetic pulse attack could disable @entity49 's key infrastructure
@entity201 : some *experts* recognize the threat , but electric grid *remains* vulnerable
he says *private* industry needs to do much more to prepare for possible threats
