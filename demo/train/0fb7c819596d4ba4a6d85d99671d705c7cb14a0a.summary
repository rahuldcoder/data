-- pope @entity4 's spokesman has denied the pontiff will resign over the arrest of his butler on suspicion of leaking confidential documents , the @entity2 press office said thursday			1
during a wednesday meeting with journalists to answer questions about the situation , the rev. @entity9 said the " hypothesis " advanced by some media outlets that the pope would resign are " baseless creations of some journalists , which have no foundation in reality			1
" @entity21 , 46 , was arrested last week and accused of illegal possession of confidential documents			1
@entity9 said wednesday that @entity21 has met with his attorneys , " who will probably request monitored surveillance or house arrest for their client			1
" @entity21 , one of only a handful of people with access to the pontiff 's private desk , has been charged with aggravated theft for allegedly stealing private documents , @entity9 said earlier			2
he is suspected of leaking the papers to an @entity38 journalist			1
the @entity2 has said confidential documents were found in @entity21 's apartment in @entity2 territory			1
but @entity9 said wednesday that media reports that said packets of documents , prepared for sending to specific people , were found in @entity21 's home were unfounded			2
material found in @entity21 's possession is being studied and catalogued , he said			0
" it seems to me , " @entity9 said , " that there is a line of desire for truth and clarity , a desire for transparency that , although it will take time , continues forward			0
i thus honestly believe that we are trying to handle this new situation : we are seeking the truth and trying to objectively understand what may have happened			0
" the investigation , he said , is still in its preliminary stages			0
last month , the @entity2 gave cardinal @entity62 a " pontifical mandate " to uncover the source of hundreds of personal letters and confidential documents given to @entity67 , an @entity38 journalist and author of " @entity69 , " a book that translates to " his holiness " and includes the documents			1
@entity67 would not divulge his sources but previously told @entity0 that his primary source -- whom he referred to as " @entity79 " in his book -- " risked life and limb " if ever discovered			0
he said the source worked inside the @entity2 but would not reveal details , including the source 's gender , age and whether or not they were clergy			2
he said this week that he had not been questioned in connection with @entity21 's arrest			2
the @entity2 called publication of @entity67 's book " criminal " when it was released in @entity38 this month			2
a top @entity93 official , archbishop @entity92 , told the @entity2 's official newspaper wednesday the theft of the documents was " an immoral act of unprecedented gravity " and a " despicable abuse of the relationship of trust that exists between @entity4 and those who turn to him			1
" with the leaks , he said , the pope 's very ministry " has come under attack			1
" but observers say the scandal lifts the lid on a secret power struggle going on behind the closed doors of the @entity93			1
the alleged documents leak , along with the firing of the head of the @entity115 , are aimed at weakening the authority of the pope 's second - in - command , they say			1
cardinal @entity121 , the @entity2 's secretary of state , is involved in a power struggle with his predecessor , the observers said			1
" the reason for this fight is that the secretary of state will have a strong influence over the next conclave which will choose the next pope , " said @entity124 , a journalist at the @entity38 daily @entity125			2
cardinal @entity132 , secretary of state to the late @entity133 , is trying to sideline @entity121 and put one of his own proteges in place before @entity4 dies , he said			0
" the leaks will end when @entity121 is out as secretary of state , " @entity124 said			0
when he became @entity2 secretary of state , @entity121 " did what normally happens , " said the rev. @entity139 , author of " inside the @entity2			0
" " he brought in his team , the people he likes , the people he trusts , and put them in key positions in the @entity2			0
" " there are people who had hitched their star to the previous secretary of state , who thought by now they would become an archbishop or a cardinal , and they did n't , " @entity139 said			0
" these people are unhappy and do n't like @entity121			0
" @entity0 's @entity153 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 says reports that the pope will step down " have no foundation in reality "
the pope 's butler is suspected of taking confidential documents , leaking them to journalist
the butler probably will seek monitored surveillance or house arrest , the @entity2 says
some say the scandal sheds light on a covert power struggle in the @entity93
