-- two years ago , the @entity2 upended the rules for campaign finance , unleashing a tsunami of unregulated , unrestricted and undisclosed spending that has , in effect , allowed donors to buy elections			1
the full impact of this decision is just now becoming clear , and it 's bad both for @entity13 's businesses and for our democracy			1
by a 5 - 4 majority , the @entity2 affirmed that money is essentially speech -- a notion first addressed in @entity20 in 1976 -- and it outlawed nearly all restrictions on independent spending by corporations or other groups , including unions , to influence elections			1
such restrictions are unconstitutional violations of free speech , the court said , and are prohibited by the @entity31			0
you might expect business owners to welcome the elimination of these restrictions , but if so , you 're about to be surprised			0
a recent poll conducted by @entity37 found that 66 % of a random sample of 500 small - business owners believe the @entity41 decision was " mostly bad " or " somewhat bad " for small business			1
since small businesses create 70 % of new jobs in the private sector , according to the @entity48 , their view should matter a lot			1
the poll was commissioned by the @entity50 , the @entity51 , and @entity52 -- three groups that represent the views of small business and which have a combined membership of more than 100,000 small businesses nationwide			1
the poll tapped the views of 500 small - business owners nationwide , most of whom are not members of the organizations conducting the survey			1
in addition to taking a dim view of @entity41 , 88 % of the small - business owners in the poll had a negative view of the role money plays in politics			1
( the margin of error in the poll is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points			0
) do small donations still matter in politics ? tell us what you think			1
small - business owners believe in our market - based , capitalist system , which depends on open and robust competition			2
unlimited campaign spending undermines this competition , in three crucial ways			1
first , allowing unlimited money into politics allows the past to hold the future hostage			2
companies ( and individuals who own them ) with sufficient resources to sway elections often represent the industries and companies of the past , rather than the industries and companies that are creating the future			0
the evidence on this is indirect , because since @entity41 was announced less than a year before the last federal election , its impact has not yet been fully felt or measured			2
however , we can gauge its future impact by looking at lobbying expenditures , for which multiyear data is widely available			0
for the period 2008 - 2011 , the computer and internet industry -- a wellspring of innovation -- spent $ 458 million on lobbying , according to the @entity112 , while the energy and natural resources industry spent more than three times as much : $ 1.55 billion			0
the ratio for election - related spending , post @entity41 , will likely be similar			1
second , allowing unlimited money in politics allows the big to achieve an unfair advantage over the small			1
this is ironic in light of the huge role small business plays in creating private sector jobs in @entity13 , even as some large corporations act as net destroyers of @entity13 jobs , when outsourcing and offshoring are factored in			2
for example , this kind of money in politics gives power to the push by big companies to repatriate offshore profits , giving some big and profitable multinational corporations lower effective tax rates than the grocer on @entity141			2
moreover , unlimited contributions give major @entity144 firms the edge over community banks , because the big banks can win loan guarantees , taxpayer bailouts and deeply discounted borrowing rates that smaller banks ca n't touch			0
third , allowing unlimited money in politics allows companies to collect ious for special favors from presidential candidates -- particularly as a result of contributions made early in the election season , when a few million dollars can swing the result in a small state like @entity163			1
@entity13 's small - business owners embrace competition -- but they demand the competition be open , robust and vigorous			2
they do n't want to be whipped by big corporations that bought an unfair advantage from senators , congressional representatives and other elected officials			0
when that happens , it 's bad for business and @entity13			0
many solutions have been proposed , ranging from the @entity2 reversing its decision , to legislation , to a constitutional amendment			0
momentum for change is growing , as candidates from both political parties learn what it 's like to have a campaign with broad public support crushed by a single individual with deep pockets who steps in to help the other side			0
@entity41 is an assault on our economy , which is supposed to be based on vigorous , free and open competition			1
it 's time for us to reinvigorate our economy by getting government out of the protection racket , and preventing industries and companies from buying special favors			2
we must undo the damage wrought by @entity41			0

the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			0

@entity208 says @entity41 ruling is bad for small businesses
he says poll found that most small businesses do n't like role of money in politics
he says that role favors old , moneyed industries , not new ones that drive innovation
@entity208 : campaign spending has *un-american* effect of *stifling* competition
