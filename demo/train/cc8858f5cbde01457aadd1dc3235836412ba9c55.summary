-- @entity1 has always liked to keep a bit of himself hidden from view			1
" i 've never been one of those actors who has touted myself as a fascinating human being , " he reportedly once said			0
" i had to decide early on whether i was to be an actor or a personality			2
" of course , the modern celebrity - industrial complex being what it is , he did n't get much of a choice			1
in hindsight , it 's hard to remember a time when @entity1 , who turns 70 on saturday , was n't @entity1 , with his movie star image -- brusque , intense , @entity15 , @entity16 -- front and center			1
( in real life , @entity1 -- despite his name -- is a mix of ethnicities , including @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , though he identifies most closely with his @entity15 heritage			1
) but that was n't always the case			2
in the first two decades of his career , he generally disappeared into roles as smoothly and casually as putting on a new suit			1
you know them all , of course			0
the brash , manic @entity35 in " @entity36 , " the first of his many @entity38 collaborations			0
the ailing , slow - witted catcher in " @entity41			2
" " @entity43 's " young @entity42			2
" @entity44 's " @entity45			2
@entity46 ( " @entity52 " ) , @entity47 ( " @entity47 " ) , @entity48 ( " @entity53 " ) , @entity49 ( " @entity54 " ) -- all chips of a multifaceted , diamond - bright talent			2
@entity55 - winning , too : he took home the statue for 1974 's " @entity59 : @entity61 " and 1980 's " @entity52 " and has been nominated five other times			1
those early characters often had something in common			0
some had hair - trigger tempers			2
( " you talkin ' to me ? " ) there were often hints of hardscrabble lives aching for success , even in cases where they 'd achieved it			0
( behind the eyes of @entity1 's @entity42 , long after he starts wearing tailored clothes , are the haunted memories of tenement flats and @entity80			1
) why we ca n't get enough of the gangster life still , there was always a sense of mystery			0
the 5 - foot - 9 actor had that mesmerizing ability to seem taller or shorter , depending on the role			1
he famously plowed himself into the method , gaining and losing weight for " @entity52 , " driving a cab for " @entity44 " and learning saxophone for " @entity94			0
" he kept viewers off balance with occasional comic turns , whether it was as a cheerful repairman in " @entity100 " or the exasperated bounty hunter in " @entity102			0
" it 's no wonder @entity104 had a song called " @entity106 , " in which they fantasized about escaping with this enigmatic leading man , " talking @entity15			0
" but , more recently , he has been @entity1 , the image taking the lead			1
given his obvious acting abilities , sometimes it has gotten a little wearying			0
why is @entity1 in " @entity114 " and " @entity115 " ? who talked @entity1 into " @entity117 , " " @entity118 " and " @entity119 " ? ca n't he work with @entity38 again ? what happened to the mystery ? well , the guy does have a movie festival , some restaurants and a hotel to support			1
besides , the actor still gets his turns			1
he was a shambling spin doctor in " @entity129 , " the creature in " @entity131 , " @entity132 in " @entity133 , " a parodistic don in " analyze this " and " @entity135 , " and the ramrod @entity137 agent in the " @entity139 " series			0
he has even started showing a little more of himself			0
he broke down while discussing last year 's " @entity142 " on @entity141 's talk show			1
and whether @entity1 or @entity1 , he 's been a steady presence			1
the guy 's always working : more than 80 films since 1968 , with seven this year alone -- including " @entity147 " with director @entity148 , who directed @entity1 's @entity55 - nominated performance in " playbook			1
" he promises more to come			0
after all , he 's only 70			2
" i might like to do things that are more retiring , " he reflected in 2011			0
as long as i 'm enjoying what i 'm doing , why retire ? " why , indeed ? birthdays are full of surprises .			0
