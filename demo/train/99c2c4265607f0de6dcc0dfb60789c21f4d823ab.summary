of the fiscal cliff , @entity1 gave us a clearer picture of what the next two to four years of federal action might look like : lengthy periods of legislative gridlock , persistent partisan finger - pointing and short bursts of incremental activity that ultimately fail to resolve the major national challenges at hand			1
and those challenges are substantial			1
our country is still struggling to fully recover from the @entity17			2
more than 12 million @entity18 are still out of work , and 107 million @entity18 are considered poor or near poor ( up from 81 million a decade ago )			2
the @entity18 ranks 16th in the world in infrastructure quality , with one in four bridges in @entity23 considered structurally deficient			2
and our education system is no longer keeping our kids competitive , leaving 15 - year - old @entity18 students ranked 31st in math and 23rd in science			1
but as has happened time and again throughout @entity18 history , our greatest innovations come at times of greatest challenge			2
true to form , inaction from the federal government has sparked the innovation of states , cities and metropolitan areas that are teeming with smart , pragmatic and bipartisan solutions to national economic challenges			1
for the second year in a row , we have identified our @entity43 and @entity44 -- actions undertaken by states and metropolitan areas in 2012 that seem ripe for meaningful impact in 2013 and beyond , as well as for replication by other communities			1
many of these innovations represent grand economy and talent - shaping gestures			1
in @entity60 , for example , a ballot initiative to support pre-kindergarten education was passed in november , championed by mayor @entity61 and the local business and civic leadership			1
the referendum provides $ 31 million a year in new sales tax revenue to expand pre-k programs , with the goal of providing every eligible student in the city a strong start on the path to secondary and post-secondary success			2
other large - scale initiatives include an @entity75 in @entity76 to leverage private investment for the energy retrofit of public buildings , and the accelerated build - out of a state of the art transit system in @entity82 -- a metropolis long known for its traffic congestion rather than transport alternatives			1
most dangerous @entity18 cities some innovations embody smaller , structural interventions			2
@entity91 gov. @entity90 's new @entity89 and @entity92 will bring a multimodal approach to solving transportation and logistics challenges that have traditionally been addressed separately and inefficiently			2
building on the state 's decision to prioritize investments in the @entity100 -- which alone carries 5 % of @entity18 trade with @entity23 by value -- the office will be instrumental in ensuring the competitiveness of the state 's large logistics sector by preparing for changing dynamics in global trade , such as the expansion of the @entity109			2
other structural initiatives include an ambitious strategy in @entity112 , @entity113 , to help small business and distinctive clusters of firms access global markets , and a new @entity118 in @entity119 , @entity120 , to capitalize on opportunities brought by @entity122			1
all of these innovations share common themes			2
they embrace a vision of economic growth that is productive , sustainable , inclusive and globally oriented			0
they are affirmative in spirit , forward - leaning in action and imaginative in design , reflecting the quintessential optimism that characterizes @entity23			0
and , perhaps most importantly , they are shaped and advanced by networks of leaders who work across jurisdictional , ideological and , yes , political lines to get stuff done			0
but most of all , these innovations in policy and practices show that american - problem solving does not rely exclusively on the work of the federal government			1
if we can accomplish such extraordinary things at the state and local level , just imagine what we can accomplish as a nation if @entity1 gets it act together and even partially embodies this same innovative spirit			1
hopefully , it wo n't take four years			1

@entity1 has been mired in *dysfunction* for years , authors say
they say the good news is local governments are *stepping* up
states and localities are finding innovative solutions to problems , they say
