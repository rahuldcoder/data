@entity0 -- president @entity2 tried thursday to invigorate the stalled @entity4 peace process , urging young @entity5 to pressure their leaders to seek peace with @entity8 while acknowledging the jewish state 's historical right to exist and defend itself from continuing threats			1
in a speech in @entity0 that @entity2 had said would lay out his vision for the region , the president urged @entity5 to look at the world through the eyes of @entity8 but also said enemies of @entity5 must change their rhetoric and tactics to reflect modern reality			1
" you are not alone , " @entity2 said in both @entity23 and @entity24 , prompting a standing ovation when he declared that " those who adhere to the ideology of rejecting @entity5 's right to exist might as well reject the @entity29 beneath them and the sky above , because @entity5 is not going anywhere			1
" hours before the speech on the second day of a @entity4 swing , two rockets fired from @entity8 - controlled @entity36 landed in southern @entity5			1
they caused no injuries or major damage , but served as a symbolic welcome to @entity2 's visit to the @entity42 on thursday to meet with @entity8 president @entity43			1
a hardline group claimed responsibility			0
@entity5 honors @entity2 in another symbolic moment , @entity2 received @entity5 's highest civilian honor -- the @entity48 -- thursday night from @entity5 president @entity49 at a state dinner that emphasized the close ties between their countries			1
noting the similarity between the histories of @entity5 and african - americans as former slaves who endured hardship before gaining freedom in a new land , @entity2 said , " our very existence , our presence here tonight , is a testament that all things are possible			2
" opinion : @entity2 goes over @entity67 's head to the @entity5 people the earlier talks with @entity43 served as a counterbalance to @entity2 's meetings the previous day with @entity5 prime minister @entity67 , setting up the @entity0 speech that addressed crucial issues of the stalled peace process as well as regional concerns such as the civil war in neighboring @entity78 and @entity79 's efforts to develop a nuclear weapon			1
when @entity2 mentioned the name of @entity43 in his speech thursday , some boos erupted in the @entity84 among the audience of mostly young @entity5			1
he also was interrupted at one point by a protester 's shouts , causing the president to joke that the heckling " made me feel at home " in reference to the caustic political climate in @entity94			0
@entity2 acknowledged the difficulty in resolving the @entity5 - @entity8 impasse , but insisted that " peace is possible " and called on young @entity5 to make it happen			1
" political leaders will not take risks if the people do not demand that they do , " @entity2 said to applause , adding a familiar theme from his @entity105 campaign speeches in declaring " you must create the change that you want to see			0
" such a direct appeal to young @entity5 was a " bold and courageous " move by @entity2 , according to @entity110 , a former @entity105 ambassador to @entity5 who now is vice president and director of foreign policy at the @entity113 in @entity94			1
noting that the president lowered expectations before his trip of what he could accomplish , @entity110 told @entity1 that @entity2 now raised expectations " sky high " that he was going to personally work to make peace possible			2
@entity121 staying for more talks recently appointed secretary of state @entity121 , who accompanied @entity2 on the trip that ends friday in @entity125 , will stay on to hold more talks with @entity5 leaders , a senior administration official told reporters in a background briefing			1
" we 've done a lot of talking , a lot of listening over the course of the last two days , we 'll do some more tomorrow , and then i think it 'll be appropriate for secretary @entity121 to discuss next steps when he returns here , " the official said			0
@entity2 said in his speech that he believes " the @entity5 people do want peace , and you have every right to be skeptical that it can be achieved , " arguing that an end to the seemingly endless conflict is necessary and " the only path to true security " for @entity5			2
" given the demographics west of the @entity148 , the only way for @entity5 to endure and thrive as a @entity151 and democratic state is through the realization of an independent and viable @entity153 , " @entity2 said			2
" given the frustration in the international community , @entity5 must reverse an undertow of isolation			0
and given the march of technology , the only way to truly protect the @entity5 people is through the absence of war -- because no wall is high enough , and no @entity164 is strong enough , to stop every enemy from inflicting harm			0
" on @entity5 trip , differences come into focus at the same time , he urged @entity5 to empathize with the plight of @entity8 , using direct and harsh imagery to make his point			2
" put yourself in their shoes -- look at the world through their eyes , " he said			0
" it is not fair that a @entity8 child can not grow up in a state of her own , and lives with the presence of a foreign army that controls the movements of her parents every single day			0
it is not just when settler violence against @entity8 goes unpunished			0
it is not right to prevent @entity8 from farming their lands ; to restrict a student 's ability to move around the @entity42 ; or to displace @entity8 families from their home			0
" he added that " neither occupation nor expulsion is the answer , " saying , " just as @entity5 built a state in their homeland , @entity8 have a right to be a free people in their own land			2
" arab states must seek normalized relations with @entity5 , and @entity8 must " recognize that @entity5 will be a jewish state , and that @entity5 have the right to insist upon their security , " @entity2 also said			1
@entity2 : @entity5 settlements ' counterproductive ' he prompted applause from the young @entity5 crowd when he criticized their government 's controversial policy of building new settlements in disputed territories			1
" israelis must recognize that continued settlement activity is counterproductive to the cause of peace , and that an independent @entity153 must be viable -- that real borders will have to be drawn , " @entity2 said			0
on a personal note , the president told how he met with young @entity8 before his speech and they differed little from his own daughters , adding that he believed @entity5 parents would want @entity8 youths to succeed if they had a chance to talk to them			1
during his earlier visit to to @entity227 in the @entity42 , @entity2 stressed the need for direct talks between @entity5 and @entity8 for a two - state solution			1
@entity8 see @entity5 ' growth ' as roadblock " the @entity8 people deserve an end to occupation and the daily indignities that come with it , " he said at a news conference with @entity43 , adding that @entity8 deserve " a future of hope " and a " state of their own			1
" @entity2 said he and @entity43 discussed , among other things , the @entity5 settlements and the issue of @entity8 prisoners			1
he called for shunning the old habits , arguments and formulas that have stymied the peace process and envisioned " two nations , two neighbors at peace , @entity5 and @entity153			0
" at the news conference and in his later speech , @entity2 said the foundation for a peace agreement exists if both sides can overcome internal and external obstacles and pressure , and can join together making the leap			2
the core issues right now , @entity2 said , are achieving sovereignty for @entity8 and security for @entity5			1
" that 's not to say settlements are not important , " he told reporters			0
" it is to say that if we solve those two problems , the settlement problem will be solved			0
so i do n't want to put the cart before the horse			0
i want to make sure that we are getting to the core issues and the substance			0
" during a news conference on wednesday with @entity67 , neither leader mentioned the settlements , showing the sensitivity of the issue for the conservative prime minister who just formed a new coalition government after a narrow election victory			0
in @entity227 on thursday , @entity2 praised the @entity285 led by @entity43 but said @entity286 , which governs @entity36 , " has the responsibility to prevent " violations of a cease - fire with @entity5 such as the two rockets fired in the morning			1
@entity43 : peace ' is necessary ' @entity43 , however , said the @entity5 settlements are " more than a hurdle to peace , " calling them illegal and saying it was @entity5 's duty to stop building them			1
at the same time , @entity43 said @entity8 believe peace " is necessary and inevitable , " and it should not be made through violence , occupation , walls , denial of refugee rights or settlements -- reciting a list of @entity8 grievances against @entity5			1
he envisioned a @entity8 state based on 1967 borders with @entity0 as capital -- a scenario unacceptable to @entity5			2
on wednesday , @entity2 and @entity67 offered a " good cop - bad cop " approach to @entity79 's nuclear ambitions			2
both countries have accused @entity79 of secretly working toward building a nuclear weapon , and @entity67 made it clear wednesday after his talks with @entity2 that he believes the president is equally committed to preventing a nuclear - armed @entity79			2
5 things to know about @entity2 's first presidential visit to @entity5 in comments to reporters wednesday and in thursday 's speech , @entity2 called for more diplomacy on @entity79 while endorsing @entity5 's right to defend itself as it sees fit			1
he also insisted that " all options " remain open -- code for a military strike to disable the @entity79 program			0
that prompted a warning thursday from @entity79 's supreme leader , @entity331 , that @entity332 would destroy @entity333 if @entity5 were to attack its nuclear facilities			0
@entity2 also warned the @entity78 government that using chemical weapons against opposition forces or allowing such weapons to be obtained by terrorists would be a " game - changer " in terms of @entity105 involvement in the conflict			0
his administration has been criticized for not providing military aid to the @entity78 opposition			0
on wednesday , @entity2 sought to assure @entity67 and @entity5 of his commitment to their security and to strengthen what have been strained personal and working relationships between the two men			0
in what @entity67 called a key development , the leaders announced new talks on extending @entity105 military assistance to @entity5 for another 10 years past the current agreement , which expires in 2017			0
opinion : @entity2 's @entity5 trip is about legacy @entity1 's @entity361 and @entity362 reported from @entity0 and the @entity42 , and @entity1 's @entity363 , @entity364 , @entity365 , @entity366 , @entity367 , @entity368 and @entity369 contributed to this report , which was written by @entity371 in @entity94 .			2
