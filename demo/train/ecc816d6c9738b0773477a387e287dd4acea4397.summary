who is @entity1 ? and why is he being held by @entity2 ? those are the questions for many following the combative exchange tuesday between @entity5 and @entity6 on @entity8 's " @entity7 , " who asked whether the former @entity11 player was planning to inquire about @entity1 , a @entity12 citizen sentenced to 15 years in a @entity2 labor camp			1
in response , @entity5 , who is in @entity2 with a team of fellow former @entity11 players , suggested the @entity17 had done something wrong , but did not specify what			1
" do you understand what he did in this country ? " @entity5 asked @entity6			2
" no , no , no , you tell me , you tell me			0
why is he held captive here in this country , why ? " here 's a look at the case : who is @entity1 ? born in @entity30 , @entity1 immigrated at age 16 to the @entity12 with his parents , his mother told @entity8			2
the 44 - year - old @entity1 , of @entity33 , @entity34 , moved to @entity35 in 2005			1
a year later he established " @entity41 , " a @entity35 - based tour company that specialized in tours of @entity2 , according to his family and @entity37 , a website established by friends to promote his release			2
described by his sister , @entity44 , as a devout @entity45 , @entity1 is married and the father of three children			2
" several years ago , @entity1 saw an opportunity that combined his entrepreneurial spirit with his personal convictions as a @entity45 , " the website said			2
" he believed in showing compassion to the @entity2 people by contributing to their economy in the form of tourism			0
" @entity1 had guided at least 15 tour groups , mostly made up of @entity12 and @entity59 , into @entity2 at the time of his arrest , his family has said			1
what happened ? this much everybody appears to agree on : @entity1 was on the first day of a five - day tour when he was arrested november 3 , 2012 , in @entity65 , an area along the northeastern coast of @entity2 that has been established by @entity67 as a special economic zone to promote trade and investment			1
@entity12 officials have struggled to establish how exactly @entity1 ran afoul of @entity2 authorities			1
word of @entity1 's arrest first surfaced in @entity30 media reports days after he was detained , with the @entity12 later confirming it			1
nearly two weeks after detaining @entity1 , @entity2 's official news agency confirmed his arrest , saying only he was picked up for a crime against the state			1
according to the state - run @entity82 , @entity82 , there was evidence uncovered that proved he had committed a crime against the country			0
among the allegations : @entity1 was setting up bases in @entity35 to topple the @entity2 government ; he was encouraging @entity2 citizens to bring down the government ; and he was conducting a " malignant smear campaign			1
" in may , the government also accused @entity1 of planning a " @entity97 operation " to bring down the government through religious activities			0
the @entity12 confessed to the offenses , the government said			0
what did he do ? there has been speculation the evidence @entity2 cites may in fact have been something @entity1 was carrying with him , perhaps a @entity106 or some other religious literature			1
his mother , @entity108 , who visited her son in @entity2 in october , told @entity8 that her son was a devout @entity45 who had not understood the @entity2 system			0
@entity2 is officially an atheist state			0
@entity1 's health @entity2 is considered to have one of the most repressive penal systems in the world			1
human rights groups estimate that as many as 200,000 people are being held in a network of prison camps that the regime is believed to use to crush political dissent			0
his mother and sister have told @entity8 that more than 10 months into @entity1 's sentence , his health is failing			1
in a prison interview with @entity128 , a pro-north @entity2 group based in @entity129 , @entity1 had spoken of health problems , including diabetes , high blood pressure , fatty liver and a back problem			2
he looked noticeably thinner and wore a blue prison garment streaked with sweat and dirt			0
" although my health is not good , i am being patient and coping well , " he said at the time			0
" and i hope that with the help of the @entity2 government and the @entity12 , i will be released soon			0
" @entity1 was moved to a hospital for serious health problems , his sister told @entity8 in august			2
in previous interviews , @entity145 has said that her brother suffers from health problems including severe back and leg pain , kidney stones , dizziness , blurred vision and loss of vision			0
he was already dealing with diabetes			0
his family says he has lost more than 50 pounds			0
bargaining chip ? the timing of @entity1 's conviction has raised questions about whether @entity67 is using him as a bargaining chip in efforts to jump - start negotiations to dismantle @entity2 's nuclear program			1
@entity34 has previously accused @entity2 of doing so to try to gain concessions			2
@entity1 's conviction followed @entity2 's testing of a long - range rocket and an underground nuclear test , moves that resulted in tougher @entity172 sanctions			1
tensions between @entity2 and the @entity12 have eased somewhat since the spring , when @entity67 unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats as @entity12 and @entity30 troops carried out large - scale military exercises in the region			0
@entity12 officials have repeatedly called on @entity2 to release @entity1			2
in august , the two countries appeared close , but @entity2 rescinded an invitation to a @entity12 envoy			0
ambassador @entity183 , president @entity184 's special envoy for @entity2 human rights issues , had been expected to fly to @entity67 to try to win @entity1 's freedom			1
in previous instances , @entity2 has released @entity12 in its custody after a visit by some @entity12 dignitary -- in recent cases , former presidents @entity192 and @entity193			0
but efforts by @entity195 , the former ambassador to the @entity172 , were unsuccessful in winning @entity1 's release during a visit to @entity2 last year			1
even @entity5 , at one point , called on @entity2 's @entity199 to release @entity1			1
" i 'm calling on the @entity203 of @entity2 or as i call him " @entity199 , " to do me a solid and cut @entity1 loose , " @entity5 said in a may 7 post to his @entity202 account			1
@entity5 's rant @entity5 's rant garnered swift reaction , with @entity195 telling @entity8 the basketball player " crossed a line this morning by implying that @entity1 might be guilty , by suggesting there was a crime			1
" @entity212 spokesman @entity211 said he had heard about @entity5 's outburst			2
" i did not see some of the comments that mr. @entity5 made , but i am not going to dignify that outburst with a response , " @entity211 said			0
but the harshest criticism of @entity5 came from @entity1 's sister , @entity145			1
" we could n't believe our ears			0
he was in a position to do some good and help advocate for @entity1 , and refused to do so , " @entity145 said on @entity221			1
" but then instead he has chosen to hurl these outrageous accusations against @entity1			0
he clearly does n't know anything about @entity1 , about his case			0
and so we were appalled by that			0

@entity1 's sister says @entity5 was in a position to do some good and refused
@entity1 , 44 , of @entity33 , @entity34 , was arrested in @entity2 in 2012
he was convicted by @entity2 of " *hostile* acts *''* in 2013
