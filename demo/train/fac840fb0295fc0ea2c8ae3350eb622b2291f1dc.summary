-- it was once the polluted hotbed of the @entity2 in @entity3 , a large area of land that became badly contaminated with toxic waste after centuries of abuse			1
but the hope of the local @entity11 organizers is that , what was once a wasteland site in @entity14 , will soon bloom with fauna and wildlife as the green heart of the @entity19 ' site			1
the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) is planning to convert the area into @entity23 's first new public park in @entity3 for over a century once the sporting event is over and -- in order to create the intended environmental legacy -- the work of planting , cultivating and remodeling the new landscape is already underway			1
the @entity31 will not only provide a public space for people to enjoy both during and after the @entity19 , the aim is to generate a variety of habitats for wildlife with 2,000 trees and 350,000 wetland plants			1
" there are all kinds of different habitats here and there are target species , " @entity38 , a project sponsor for the parklands and public realm at the authority , told @entity0			0
" we have things like the frog ponds , which hold water and have loggeries in them			0
" we also have over 700 wildlife installations			2
we have wet woodland , which is a very rare habitat that feeds off the river to keep it wet			0
" wetland areas have been central to the regeneration of the area , specifically along the banks of the @entity61 , which runs from the @entity23 's east coast and through the heart of the @entity23 capital			1
" this is part of a huge vision for restoring working landscapes in the whole of the @entity69 , which is great for bio-diversity and great for people , " @entity38 said			2
" parks like this create those places where people want to live , work and play			0
" turning the former industrial area into a suitable home for plants and animals has not been a straightforward process			0
factories had been located on the site in the 18th and 19th centuries , which left the soil in need of special treatment			1
" this site was one of the crucibles of the @entity2 in @entity3 , " @entity38 said			1
" some of the land was heavily contaminated after centuries of abuse			1
" we had what we called ' soil hospitals			0
' they were treating all of the materials to make sure that it was suitable for re-use on the site			0
" @entity101 , head of international environmental organization @entity102 has been working on the issue of the @entity19 coming to @entity3 since 2003 , two years prior to the city being awarded the @entity105			1
he told @entity0 he was generally supportive of the work being done by the @entity20			0
" the plan they have come up with is about trying to create some of the old @entity3 habitat that used to exist there , " said @entity107			2
" grasslands , meadows , woodland and waterways as well , and i think that 's been done well			0
" they are putting in a long - term management plan for the area			0
there 's a 10 - year management plan for the park , which is a good start			0
" they are trying to manage the land to be of high conservation value , to the point where some parts of it would be on the way to being designated as a site of special scientific interest , which is the highest possible designation in this country			2
so that 's a good ambition			0
" @entity134 also praised the honesty of @entity3 's organizers with regards to making information about the @entity19 available			1
" we said to them that we do want you to be open and transparent about what the impact of putting on the @entity19 would be , and they published that			2
" we were very pleased they did			0
we think it 's important , if you 're going to learn lessons from staging the @entity19 , that you have a baseline of information about what it actually takes to host the @entity105			1
" this is the first time it has been done , @entity3 has been good in that respect			2
" @entity3 has held the @entity105 on two previous occasions , in 1908 and 1948 -- next year 's event will begin with the opening ceremony on july 27 and conclude on august 12 .			1

@entity3 's @entity31 has been designed to accommodate both people and local wildlife
