just when it looked like @entity2 was settling down after toppling @entity4 president @entity3 over the weekend , tension flared again in @entity5 , the southern part of the country where support for @entity9 is strong			1
armed men seized regional government buildings in @entity5 and hoisted the @entity9 flag			1
rival demonstrators chanted " @entity5 is @entity9 " and " @entity5 is not @entity9 " back and forth at each other			1
with the peninsula turning into a flashpoint , here are five things you need to know about @entity5			2
@entity5 is n't legally part of @entity9 now , but it has been in the past			1
@entity22 has had an interest in @entity5 for hundreds of years , with its rich farmland and its access to the @entity26			2
@entity9 gave @entity5 to @entity2 in 1954 , when both @entity9 and @entity2 were part of the @entity28			1
after the @entity28 collapsed in 1991 , there was some local desire for @entity5 to leave @entity2 and become part of @entity9 again , but lawmakers in @entity2 and @entity5 voted for it to stay part of @entity2			1
gunmen seize government buildings in @entity5 , raise @entity9 flag 2			1
a lot of @entity9 still live in @entity5			1
there are actually three main groups in @entity5 : ethnic @entity2 in the north , @entity9 in the south , and a third group called @entity43 in the middle			1
the tatars represent 15 to 20 % of the population and suffered badly under @entity47 in the @entity28 era			0
they 're " deadest against annexation by @entity9 , " @entity50 of @entity51 told a @entity53 audience last week			2
part of the @entity56 is based in @entity5			1
any talk about the importance of @entity5 to @entity9 quickly turns to the @entity59			2
the @entity56 has had a base at the @entity5 city of @entity62 , on the @entity26 , for 230 years			2
ships and subs based there are just north of @entity66 and can reach the @entity67 to influence the @entity68 and the @entity69			0
an expert at the @entity71 has been arguing that the importance of the @entity59 can be overstated			0
it is the smallest of the @entity56 's four fleets , and @entity9 has a @entity26 coast of its own			1
in fact , @entity9 is expanding its @entity26 port of @entity79 and moving military vessels there , @entity76 argues			2
and yet @entity62 clearly remains significant for @entity9			0
in 2010 , @entity22 gave @entity2 a good deal on natural gas , partly in exchange for @entity84 extending the @entity9 @entity56 lease on the base in @entity2			1
@entity5 has played a vital role in world history before			0
even if you do n't know anything else about the @entity91 , you 've heard of @entity92 , the founder of modern nursing			0
it was in the @entity91 in the 1850s that she became known as the @entity92 , caring for soldiers wounded in the war that @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity66 fought against @entity9			0
generations of @entity98 schoolchildren have memorized a poem dating from the war : " @entity105 , " by @entity104			0
the poem commemorates a blunder when @entity98 troops attacked the wrong @entity9 position and were slaughtered , memorialized by @entity104 in the lines : " theirs not to reason why , theirs but to do and die			0
" that same battle added a word to the @entity114 language : it was called the @entity116			0
and do n't forget @entity117 , of course			0
when @entity120 was grinding to an end in 1945 , the @entity119 leaders -- @entity123 president @entity122 , @entity98 prime minister @entity124 and @entity28 leader @entity47 -- met to divide up @entity125			0
that meeting , which laid the groundwork for the @entity128 , took place in the @entity5 resort of @entity117			0
