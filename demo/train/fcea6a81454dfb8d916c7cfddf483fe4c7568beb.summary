, @entity1 pitched a funny idea			1
" people are always trying to come up with creative ways of engaging the viewers , " she tells @entity0			2
" and i thought well , i play a housekeeper on a show , what if i went and cleaned the house of " raising @entity4 's " biggest fan			1
" the network thought she was joking , but she was serious			2
the contest begins today at www.fox.com/cleansweep			2
through october 8 , fans can enter by submitting their best " @entity20 " and a paragraph stating why their family is just like the chance family and why they deserve a house call from @entity1 and her tv husband @entity26			1
yes , he 's coming along to , to make like his character and mow the winner 's lawn			1
( and okay , they 'll have professional crews there to help them			2
) " @entity4 " creator @entity34 will select the winner from the top 10 finalists in mid-october , and @entity1 and @entity26 will get their hands dirty later that month or in early november			1
@entity0 : what does this say about your commitment to promoting your show ? @entity1 : well , i think it says a lot about my commitment to promoting the show			1
[ @entity49 ] it 's a funny thing : a lot of people who have n't seen the show yet say they have n't watched because they 're not really sure what it is			1
they think it 's about a baby , or that it 's extremely dumb or something			1
but i think this show is a lot smarter than people realize			2
the writing is very , very sharp			2
if dare i say it , it 's a lot more sophisticated underneath			1
[ @entity49 ] do you know what i mean ? the exterior is really ridiculous and silly , but there 's real sophistication in the writing , and i 'm really proud to be a part of it			1
and i think it 's really smart , and it makes me laugh			1
if it makes me laugh , well , i 'm sorry , but then it must be good			2
[ @entity49 ] because i do n't laugh at a lot of things			0
i 'm thrilled that we got a third season			0
i very much would like for people to enjoy this show as much as i do			0
i want to share it with the largest amount of people i can			0
and i will do what is necessary			0
@entity88 : ' @entity89 ' sing for @entity0 ! clearly			0
have you given @entity34 any guidelines for choosing the winner ? we should stay away from hoarders , crime scenes , and people with too many cats			1
i 'm not bringing a hazmat suit			0
what 's your personal cleaning specialty that fans should be aware of ? i am excellent with laundry			1
for example , as a laundry expert , i never use fabric softener on towels because it makes them less absorbent			0
i do n't know if your readers know this			0
you should not put bounce sheets or fabric softener in with your towels			0
you should dry them separately without fabric softener , so they stay absorbent			0
and i 'm kind of a bed fascist			0
i do n't know if i 'll be doing this in the home of our winner , but i like to iron my sheets			1
i 'm that kind of odd person weirdo			0
