-- five million dollars in five years			1
that 's what @entity3 's foundation is setting out to raise for its girls ' school in @entity6			1
the group will begin rolling out its first - ever large - scale fundraising campaign in january			1
" it will create a fund so that the girls in @entity15 can go to school for free as long as the school exists , " said @entity9 , executive director of @entity12 's @entity11			2
" this will have a huge impact on their future			2
it would be like investing in a girl for 13 years with one donation			2
" the funds will also help the group create a two - year program for the school 's graduates to get certified in teaching , midwifery , computer training or tailoring			1
a year ago , building a campaign of this magnitude would not have been possible for the group			2
with only @entity36 and @entity37 handling the bulk of the work , they had little time to focus on the foundation 's long - term plan			2
this year , however , they were able to make significant changes thanks to a special training program created by the @entity46 , a leading supporter of nonprofits worldwide			1
last december , @entity37 and other top 10 heroes from previous years , along with members from their organizations , attended the three - day intensive training designed to help the @entity49 ' nonprofits build a strong , sustainable foundation for long - term success			1
@entity46 provided the training -- known as @entity57 -- for free			1
" we 're here as a foundation to invest in visionary leaders so they can improve the quality of life for everyone , and these heroes embody that perfectly , " said @entity58 , director of operations for the @entity46			1
the heroes underwent a condensed version of the foundation 's multiple @entity69 , which typically take place over 13 months			2
@entity46 , which has trained more than 700 organizations , tailored the program for the heroes , who often start small and lack background in running a nonprofit			1
" getting the ( @entity0 ) attention internationally , they 're given a gift that can not be allowed to go by the wayside , " @entity58 said			2
" @entity57 helps the heroes leverage the affirmation and public attention of their work to benefit their organizations and put them on a path towards greater sustainability			2
" @entity90 , who travels to @entity91 to provide prosthetic and orthotic care to people in need , translated what he learned at @entity57 into more consistent financial support for his group			2
" ( it ) has broadened my view on how to cultivate and sustain relationships with donors , " said @entity90 , whose group in the first quarter of 2013 raised almost as much as its 2012 annual budget			2
" i have learned that sharing our mission 's vision is not just about telling the story , but that it needs to go more in depth by telling the story with passion in order to involve the potential donor			0
" on the last day of the program , the trainers had one - on - one sessions with each organization and helped them develop a customized plan , prioritize their goals and commit to taking necessary actions toward achieving them			1
after the training , participants worked for 90 days to implement specific goals			1
each hero then had a follow - up phone call with a trainer to review their progress			0
@entity58 said the trainers specifically commented about the " exceptional motivation " they experienced with the heroes and that they worked very hard achieving many of the goals			0
" when we compare them with the regular @entity136 , they 're completing their goals at higher rates , " she said			0
" the steps they 're taking , and the partnership they 've developed with their board , are moving their organizations in the right direction			0
" @entity144 said @entity145 played a strong role in her group 's growth this year			0
she and her @entity144 nearly tripled the number of workshops and retreats they held for military widows in previous years			0
" the training gave us the confidence to know that we can take big leaps , " @entity153 said			1
" they made us be open in our strong suits and our weaknesses			0
hearing from other heroes that their struggles were similar to ours really helped me and our team realize they 're not just an issue in our organization			0
" @entity168 expanded her organization internationally this year , which she attributes to a lot of what she learned at @entity57			0
her @entity172 , which helps children stay connected to their incarcerated parents through video messages , recently filmed messages with mothers in a @entity179 prison and delivered them to their children			0
" the trainers , speakers and interaction , with the feedback we received , made this one of the best trainings i know i have been to , " @entity168 said			0
" we walked away with stuff that was usable and practical			0
... it not only showed us what we could improve on , but how to do it			0
" for @entity193 's group , which provides free athletic activities and a supportive community for ex-addicts in @entity197 , the training helped them bring on new board members with the experience and background needed to scale the program into new communities			1
" in the spring and early summer , we 'll be opening in @entity203 , and we 've tried to do it very thoughtfully , " he said			0
" without the training , we may have run at a lot of different opportunities and spread ourselves thin			1
" in addition to the invaluable guidance , many participants were able to build friendships and network with fellow heroes			0
" just being in a room with present and past heroes who are making a difference was an honor , " said @entity214 , whose school in @entity179 provides free education for @entity218 orphans			1
" apart from working nonstop , we had many laughs and an opportunity to meet each other on a personal level , knowing more about each other 's work from their hearts			0
" this year , @entity46 is again providing its free @entity57 training as part of the award package for the @entity49			1
along with a group of past heroes , they will attend the seminar next month at the @entity238 in @entity239			1
the group will be treated to a special evening event under the @entity242 , which is on display at the @entity244 , and an astronaut will address the heroes			1
" the kind of vision , aspiration and dreams the individuals who built the shuttle have to have embodies what the heroes represent as well , " @entity58 said			0
" it will be a fabulous night of inspiration that makes us rethink the importance of community service and how to give back , and how rewarding it is when we do			0

the @entity46 is focusing on supporting leaders in their *philanthropy*
it customized a special training program for @entity268 past and present
" the training gave us the confidence to know that we can take big leaps , " one @entity270 said
