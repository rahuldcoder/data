@entity0 -- the official limousine awaiting president @entity5 's arrival in @entity6 malfunctioned after its driver refueled it using gasoline rather than diesel fuel , an official said wednesday			1
the limo failed to start , and required towing in @entity0 at 10 a.m. local time			1
@entity5 , who landed in @entity12 around noon , was not in the country at the time the limo was towed			1
a second presidential limo was brought to transport @entity5			1
" we experienced mechanical trouble with one of the cars , " @entity15 , a spokesman for the @entity16 , told a pool reporter traveling with @entity5			2
" we do n't know the cause			0
" @entity15 could n't confirm reports the limo was refueled using gasoline rather than diesel			1
" that 's why we bring different multiple vehicles , " @entity15 said			0
the tow truck company owner who picked up the limo said the @entity31 consulate called him to tow the vehicle in @entity0 because it would n't start			2
multiple official vehicles are typically flown ahead of time to destinations where @entity5 is visiting			1
on his trip to the @entity37 , @entity5 will stop in @entity12 and @entity0 in @entity6 , @entity38 in the @entity39 , and will visit with @entity41 's @entity40 in that nation			1
the presidential limousine , known as the " @entity44 , " is a specially built cadillac that 's estimated to weigh 8 tons			2
there are multiple , identical copies that are used to transport @entity5 around @entity48 and on his trips out of town			2
the @entity16 is tight - lipped about the specifics of the vehicle , but the car reportedly features inches of armor and bulletproof glass , doors and windows that seal shut in the event of a gas attack , and special shocks to absorb blasts			0
it 's said to be built on a medium - grade truck chassis , the @entity65 , which runs on diesel fuel			1
diesel engines differ from gas engines in the way the internal combustions are created to drive the pistons			0
diesel engines utilize compressed air to generate heat that causes the fuel to ignite			0
gas engines ignite fuel using spark plugs			0
using gas instead of diesel could cause major damage to the pistons , wrist pins and connecting rods , which would be destroyed if the fuel is ignited at the wrong time			0
gasoline is also less viscous than diesel , which acts as a lubricant for the fuel pump and fuel delivery systems			2
those parts could also be destroyed if gasoline is pumped into a diesel engine			0
