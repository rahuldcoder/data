in matters regarding @entity2 , the international community seems to be learning from experience			1
why galvanize support for a government that then exercises its sovereignty by not backing up that support ? why effuse sympathy on people who themselves seem to care so little ? when more than 200 girls were in april 2014 kidnapped by @entity14 terrorists from their school in @entity16 , the international community rallied around @entity2			1
from @entity19 to @entity20 to @entity21 , personalities from across the globe lent their voices to the # @entity24 social media campaign			0
this response contrasted greatly to the relative apathy which followed what has been described by @entity28 as @entity14 's deadliest attack -- the massacre of up to 2,000 mostly women and children in @entity34 town of northeast @entity2 last week			1
at about the same time that the @entity34 bloodbath was making headlines around the world , the international community was rallying around @entity39 in support against the terrorist attacks on the @entity43 newspaper offices in @entity44 , giving rise to the # @entity47 social media campaign			1
a simultaneous # @entity49 social media campaign has failed to gain much steam			0
the @entity52 proverb points out that a man can not expect you to both marry a wife for him and then buy the new couple a bed on which to sleep			0
similarly , a country is expected to take responsibility and set sail with the winds of global support			0
@entity39 's president @entity64 was addressing the world 's media and showing leadership within minutes of the attack			2
his government 's efforts to hunt down the terrorists were broadcast for all the world to see			2
@entity2 's president @entity74 , on the other hand , waited two weeks before even offering a word on the @entity16 kidnappings			1
so far , he has said nothing about @entity34			0
however , president @entity74 has issued a statement condemning the @entity44 attacks			1
perhaps it is not that the @entity2 government does not care about its own people			1
perhaps they simply want to spare us the repetitiveness of their public statements and condemnations : " the perpetrators of this dastardly act shall be brought to book "			0
" no stone shall be left unturned "			0
" @entity93 will punish them and their families "			0
but who cares about words and worn - out clich√©s ? action is what the @entity2 people need			1
one year on , the fact remains that -- despite predictions that they would be released imminently -- the more than 200 missing girls have still not been found			0
the @entity14 perpetrators , rather than cowering under the fire of the @entity2 armed forces , have become bolder			1
more women and girls have been kidnapped			0
communities in the northeast of @entity2 are being raided and razed on an almost weekly basis			2
it is also possible that the @entity2 government 's incertitude is being misconstrued as sluggishness or inaction			1
maybe they do not believe that things are as bad as is being widely reported by the international media			0
last year , president @entity74 's wife , @entity122 , openly queried the veracity of the missing girls report			2
this week , the @entity2 defense ministry insisted that fewer than 150 lives were lost in the @entity34 attack , as opposed to @entity28 's quoted 2,000			1
some @entity2 i 've listened to have also expressed their doubts about the 2,000 figure			1
they believe that , similar to the @entity133 's assertion that more than 67 % of @entity2 are living in poverty , the @entity34 reports are all part of the international community 's grand conspiracy to taint @entity2 , to make our country look bad			2
they insist that the international media , in their quest to excavate bad news from " @entity144 , " have simply latched on to an unverified casualty figure			0
unfortunately , the @entity2 media -- presumably not part of this grand international conspiracy -- are unable to provide us with enough alternative information			2
they are too busy covering the preparations for the forthcoming elections scheduled to take place in february			0
political rallies are beamed live on local tv and radio stations for hours every day			0
photographs of grinning politicians are splashed on newspaper front pages every morning , their latest pronouncements and promises stealing all the headlines			2
current affairs programs and opinion pages are consumed with the adulation or derogation of either president @entity74 or his main contender at the polls , general @entity168			0
@entity34 and other such will clearly have to take a back seat until after the elections			0
nevertheless , the ongoing carnage in @entity2 's northeast will definitely be a determining factor in the outcome of the february elections			1
a recent snap poll by @entity2 's @entity178 ( which partners with the @entity180 's @entity179 ) identified security as one of the key issues that @entity2 want their president to focus on in 2015			1
i suspect that those @entity2 who believe the relatively popular theory in certain ethnic circles that the rise in @entity14 attacks are being orchestrated by unknown forces who want president @entity74 out by all means , will vote to keep him in -- just to prove a point to his enemies that their vicious efforts did not work			1
others who feel that @entity74 is simply insensitive and incapable of handling the crisis will probably vote @entity168			0
whatever happens at the polls , @entity2 has to at some point face the @entity14 issue squarely -- even after the international media frenzy around the group 's latest attacks has died down , as it surely will			1
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author .			2

up to 2,000 people in northeast @entity2 killed in @entity14 's worst ever attack in early *january*
@entity211 : @entity2 's government has expressed more sympathy for the @entity44 terror attacks than the latest massacre within its own borders
