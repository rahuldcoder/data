@entity0 -- more than one in five people live in extreme poverty globally , according to a new report , though @entity7 's continued economic growth has improved the lives of millions			1
the poverty rate in the world 's most populous country fell by nearly three - quarters in the last six years , from 26 % in 2007 to 7 % by 2012 , the report by @entity10 , a @entity11 - based research company , said			2
such a trend is attributed to the economic reforms within the country in the last couple of decades			0
one particular aspect of this socio - economic success has been the rapid industrialization of the country , with a major pivot of people moving from the poorer rural areas of the country to more well off jobs in urban centers , particularly within the manufacturing sector			0
improved education and healthcare have also played a role in helping many out of poverty in @entity7			0
growth factor but @entity7 's remarkable economic growth , which has rebounded to 7.8 % this quarter , up from the previous quarter 's growth of 7.5 % has been crucial -- though forecasts by the @entity37 estimate growth will slow down in 2014 , falling to 7.25 %			2
these substantial strides by @entity7 meant overall poverty across the globe was halved from 40 % to 20 % within two decades , according to @entity42 president @entity41			1
@entity10 interviews more than 2,000 people per year within @entity7 to obtain its results			0
many remain in poverty despite @entity7 's stellar improvements , the data found that many across the globe still live in extreme poverty , which @entity10 classifies as those living on us $ 1.25 a day or less			1
@entity54 was found to have the highest levels of poverty , with the majority of the population in the region -- 54 % -- living under extreme poverty			1
the statistics in @entity61 and @entity62 are even more dire , with 90 % of the population classed in this category			0
at the other end of the spectrum , the @entity11 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 all had the most positive results , with 1 % or less of the overall population in these regions living in conditions of extreme poverty			2
the @entity42 is aiming to cut the extreme poverty rate to 3 % globally by 2030			1
this ambitious aim means that many countries in @entity54 and @entity77 would need to slash their " extreme poverty rates " by over half			1
@entity10 surveyed 131 countries and its findings were solely based on self - reported income .			0

@entity10 report shows @entity7 growth *responsible* for *reduction* in extreme poverty for many
rapid economic development and urbanization also major *contributing* factors
but 54 % of @entity54 lives on less than us $ 1.25 or less a day
@entity42 aims to cut down on those that live in " extreme poverty " to 3 % worldwide by 2030
