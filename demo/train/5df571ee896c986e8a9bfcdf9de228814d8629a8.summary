" @entity8 " has been setting ratings records for @entity1 this season , so it 's probably no surprise that the fantasy hit is once again settings records for illegal downloading too			1
according to piracy - monitoring blog @entity11 , the season 4 thrones finale " @entity10 " had roughly 1.5 million downloads within just the first 12 hours after the finale aired on the premium cable network , with more than 250,000 users sharing the same file ( a record - breaking " swarm " of users )			1
the site estimates that total number of downloads will exceed 7.5 million in the days to come			2
@entity23 : ' @entity8 ' full coverage on @entity1 , the episode delivered 9.3 million viewers its first night , and is expected to eventually surpass the show 's current season average across all platforms ( including the network 's streaming player ) of 18.6 million viewers			2
earlier this season , " thrones " topped " @entity35 " to officially rank as the network 's most - watched series of all time , while also ranking as the show 's most illegally downloaded season as well			1
@entity1 tends to view piracy from a somewhat grudgingly pragmatic standpoint			1
the premium network officially condemns theft , yet also recognizes that " thrones " is an enormous hit , that content leakage is tough to prevent and that the show 's popularity among pirates is inevitable ( countries such as @entity50 , where viewers do n't receive new episodes via pay cable in a timely manner , tend to be among the biggest piracy territories )			2
@entity1 's programming president @entity57 last year told @entity23 that the downloading was a " compliment of sorts , " noting , " the demand is there			1
and it certainly did n't negatively impact the dvd sales			0
[ @entity65 is ] something that comes along with having a wildly successful show on a subscription network			0
" @entity23 : ' @entity8 ' showrunners talk season 5 this year , @entity1 added this statement : " there are numerous anti-theft tools we utilize and we have significantly shrunk the international distribution window for original programming to practically correspond with the @entity76 premiere			2
unfortunately , with popularity comes piracy			0
good news is " @entity8 " continues to grow significantly and tens of millions are watching the series legally around the world			0
" @entity83 , ceo of @entity1 's parent company @entity84 , once claimed that piracy resulted in more @entity1 subscriptions			1
" @entity8 is the most pirated show in the world			0
that 's better than an @entity89			0
