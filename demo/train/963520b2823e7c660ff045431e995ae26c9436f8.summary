-- @entity1 , the @entity2 superstar , has become more than a little accustomed to being adored by millions			1
" i do n't want to be anonymous ... i 'm very honest about that			0
i love being recognized , i love people liking me , i love the fact that people scream when i go out			0
i think i 'll miss all that when it 's taken away , " he told @entity0			1
but earlier this year comments by @entity1 , the owner of the @entity11 cricket team @entity10 , caused a storm of controversy and attention he did n't want			1
@entity1 questioned the lack of @entity17 players in this year 's competition , and @entity21 @entity20 nationalist party @entity19 interpreted the comments as inflammatory			1
threats were made to boycott his latest film and some activists made some threats against him and his family 's safety			1
" it just went onto a political agenda platform , onto an activist platform			0
i 'm not on the same playing field			0
i 'm an actor , i 'm not a politician , " he said			0
" this was my point of view ... it was n't as if i was saying something new			0
i did n't know it would cause so much trouble , and especially when a film was releasing , you do n't want that kind of trouble			1
it just went completely through the roof			0
" @entity1 is keen to keep his roles as an actor , cricket team boss and icon for millions as far from the political realm as possible			1
his face is one of the most salable in @entity21 with his image used in a raft of adverts and supporting products			0
yet his recent film " @entity61 " did touch upon religious sensitivities , striking a chord among cinema goers in @entity65 countries across the world			1
in the film @entity1 , himself a @entity65 , plays an autistic @entity65 immigrant in @entity70 soon after the terrorists attack on september 11 , 2001			2
" i really thought the film was about humanity			2
it 's not about @entity75 , it could have been about any religion to be honest , " he said			2
" but i simply thought we made a film about humanity			2
i knew it would do well but i did n't know it would this well because it is a very niche sort of a subject			0
