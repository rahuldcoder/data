@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 explorers have dived deep below the @entity5 in a submersible and planted their national flag on the seabed to stake a symbolic claim to the energy riches of the @entity11			1
the @entity13 research ship carried about 100 scientists to the region			2
a mechanical arm on thursday dropped a specially made , rust - proof titanium flag painted with the @entity4 tricolor on to the @entity11 seabed at a depth of 4,261 meters ( 13,980 feet )			1
" it was so lovely down there , " @entity22 news agency quoted expedition leader @entity23 as saying as he emerged from one of two submersibles that made the dive			0
" if a hundred or a thousand years from now someone goes down to where we were , they will see the @entity4 flag , " said @entity23 , 67 , a top @entity28 member of parliament			1
@entity1 wants to extend right up to the @entity5 the territory it controls in the @entity11 , believed to hold vast reserves of untapped oil and natural gas , which is expected to become more accessible as climate change melts the ice			1
president @entity42 congratulated the expedition by telephone on " the outstanding scientific project , " local agencies reported			0
@entity46 , who heads the @entity48 lower chamber of parliament and the @entity1 party , hailed the expedition as " a new stage of developing @entity1 's polar riches			2
" " this is fully in line with @entity1 's strategic interests , " local media quoted him as saying			2
" i am proud our country remains the leader in conquering the @entity11			1
i am proud @entity61 members took part in this unprecedented mission			2
" major @entity4 channels aired a message from the @entity4 crew manning the @entity67 who said " this achievement must inspire the younger generation "			1
earlier on thursday @entity71 mocked @entity1 's ambitions and said the expedition was nothing more than a show			0
" this is n't the 15th century			0
you ca n't go around the world and just plant flags and say ' we 're claiming this territory ' , " @entity71 foreign minister @entity77 told @entity79 television			0
under international law , the five states with territory inside the @entity87 -- @entity71 , @entity89 , @entity1 , the @entity90 and @entity91 via its control of @entity93 -- have a 320 - kilometer ( 200 - mile ) economic zone around the north of their coastline			0
@entity1 is claiming a larger slice extending as far as the pole because , @entity0 says , the @entity11 seabed and @entity101 are linked by one continental shelf			1
" then @entity1 can give foundation to its claim to more than a million square kilometers of the oceanic shelf , " said a news reader for @entity1 's state news channel @entity105 , which made the expedition its top news story			1
@entity4 media have said the move could raise tension with the @entity90 in a battle for @entity11 gas			1
" i 'm not sure of whether they 've put a metal flag , a rubber flag or a bed sheet on the ocean floor			0
either way , it does n't have any legal standing or effect on this claim , " @entity123 deputy spokesman @entity122 told reporters			0
a @entity132 reporter on board the mission support ship said crew members cheered as @entity23 climbed out of the submersible and was handed a pair of slippers			1
" this may sound grandiloquent but for me this is like placing a flag on the moon , this is really a massive scientific achievement , " @entity138 , spokesman for @entity1 's @entity139 , told @entity2			2
@entity1 says the mission is intended to show that the @entity144 , a 1,800 - kilometer underwater mountain range that extends under the @entity11 to near the pole , is a geological extension of @entity4 territory			1
it denied it was a land grab			0
" the aim of this expedition is not to stake @entity1 's claim but to show that our shelf reaches to the @entity5 , " foreign minister @entity150 told reporters in @entity152 , where he is attending a regional security conference			2
the @entity160 submersible reached the seabed at 1208 @entity0 time ( 0808 gmt ) and returned to the surface exactly six hours later			2
a second @entity4 submersible , manned by @entity166 businessman @entity165 and @entity168 adventurer @entity167 , reached the seabed 27 minutes later			1
it reached a depth of 4,302 meters			0
@entity173 and @entity90 nuclear submarines have often traveled under the polar icecap , but until thursday none had reached the seabed under the pole			0
