-- @entity2 's preparations for the @entity3 came to a shuddering halt after he was stunned by @entity6 's @entity5 at the @entity7 thursday			1
@entity8 , who was playing his first tournament since losing to @entity10 at @entity11 in march , suffered a 6 - 4 1 - 6 6 - 2 third round defeat by the 14th seed			1
the @entity15 ace follows @entity16 in crashing out of the tournament with the @entity19 star losing to @entity21 's @entity20 on tuesday @entity2 , 31 , has won 17 grand slam titles during his illustrious career , but has managed just one win at @entity3			1
this defeat will see him slip down below @entity26 to number three in the world and @entity2 admits his performance came as something as a surprise			1
" overall , i 'm pretty disappointed with my play , " he told a press conference following the match			2
" i 'm not sure how well @entity5 thought he played			1
i did n't think he had to play his very best either , which is even more disappointing			2
" it does n't change my mindset going forward			0
i 'm going to go back to the practice court , train hard , and make sure i do n't have these kind of days anymore			0
" but while the start of the @entity3 is less than three weeks away , @entity2 is adamant this latest setback will not affect his chances of glory at @entity3			1
he told reporters : " we 're not playing for the @entity3			0
we 're weeks away from the @entity3			0
" it 's nice to have the @entity3 as a tournament on the calendar but not everything is sacrificed for that			2
" for that particular player or for the media or the fans the @entity3 is the ultimate thing and the only thing they care about			0
" then clearly @entity7 is the lead up tournament			1
" that 's not how i see it			2
for me , every tournament counts			0
" so i 'm as disappointed losing here as the @entity3			0
there is no difference really			0
" but for @entity5 , who lost his only previous meeting in straight sets against @entity2 in @entity68 two years ago , this was possibly the greatest win of his career			1
" he 's my idol , " the 23 - year - old told reporters after seeing off @entity2			1
" beating him was one of my career objectives			0
" it 's fantastic that this happened on a clay court			2
as you know , it 's not my best surface			2
" " i lost second or third round last week and i was struggling a little bit so i did n't have much confidence			0
" but i played two good matches in the first and second round and to beat @entity2 , well , i 'll need a couple days to celebrate			1
" @entity5 will play @entity87 qualifier @entity85 for a place in the semifinal			1
meanwhile , @entity10 is into the last eight after defeating @entity92 @entity91 6 - 2 6 - 3			1
the @entity93 , who lost out in the third round last year , has won four titles since his return to action in february following a seven - month injury layoff			2
@entity10 , who is hoping to win an eighth @entity3 crown in @entity101 , told @entity87 television that he was happy with his current level of fitness			2
" we are just doing what we can every day , " the 26 - year - old told @entity107			2
" i am in the quarterfinals and it makes me very happy to have another chance to play in @entity7 in front of these magnificent fans			1
" it 's not the time to be talking more than necessary			0
i will try to enjoy every moment as much as possible			0
" meanwhile , sixth seed @entity117 sealed a quarterfinal place with a 7 - 6 7 - 5 win over @entity121			1
@entity122 , seeded seventh , came from a set down to defeat @entity87 's @entity124 4 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 2			1
but there was bad news for @entity16 's conqueror , @entity20 , who was beaten 3 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 1 by @entity128			1
in the women 's side of the tournament , @entity129 cruised into the last eight with 6 - 3 6 - 1 win over @entity135			1
@entity129 , who suffered a shock opening round defeat at last year 's @entity3 , has now won eight straight matches on clay this season			0
" i think more than anything i learned not to become overconfident , " she told reporters			0
" i think i 'll just take that with me to the @entity145 this year			0
i think i was a little confident last year and i felt really good ; this year i 'm going to take every moment like it 's my last			0
" @entity148 booked her place in the quarterfinals with a comfortable 6 - 2 7 - 5 win over @entity153 's @entity152			1
and @entity148 , currently ranked second in the world , believes she 's in great form going into the defense of her title at @entity3			1
" i think when you win a @entity162 on a surface , it would be pretty mean of me to say that i 'm not comfortable on the surface , " she told reporters			0
" it took me many years to get to the level of where i am today			0
it certainly did n't happen overnight			0
" i worked extremely hard on getting stronger and recovering better , moving better on the court , giving myself a better position on the court , especially after being on the defensive and trying to play aggressively as i always do on quicker surfaces			0
