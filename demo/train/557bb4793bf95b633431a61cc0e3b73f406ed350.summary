@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a round - table meeting with government advisers and researchers of a government - run think tank on april 14 , premier @entity3 enjoined them to listen to people 's voices and relay these truthfully to top leaders			1
@entity3 's call to speak the truth comes at a time when the @entity1 authorities are rounding up dissenters and muzzling whistle - blowers			1
a contradiction ? analysts say @entity3 's statement is designed to counter public scepticism and to warn officials against lying or pandering to higher ups			1
others suggest it may just be part of @entity0 's crisis management			1
a @entity29 commentary explains that @entity3 's appeal is meant to elicit accurate assessment of the situation so authorities can deal with problems effectively			1
" i do n't think it is in contradiction to the party 's crackdown on dissents , " says @entity35 , a political science professor at @entity36			0
" @entity3 is trying to promote the legitimacy of the party , at least on the surface , whereas the dissidents want to destroy it			2
" in recent years , @entity1 has seen communist governments in @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 swept by political turmoil called the " color revolution "			2
@entity0 has also watched authoritarian regimes in the @entity54 and @entity55 toppled by popular uprisings			1
the fall of these regimes has raised the spectre of a @entity1 " jasmine revolution			1
" that does not seem likely -- yet			0
more than 30 years after chairman @entity65 's death , the @entity63 regime has built one of the most successful authoritarian governments in the world , delivering double - digit economic growth while keeping its one - party grip			1
still , @entity1 's leaders fear outbreaks of @entity74 ( chaos )			1
" they are not complacent , " says a retired @entity77 official , who declined to be identified			0
" they may disagree on the ways and means but they agree on one goal that anti-government acts will be nipped in the bud at all cost			0
they do not care what other people and countries will say			0
" they have good reasons to fret			0
the country is grappling with high inflation , endemic corruption , growing pollution concerns and a widening gap between the rich and the poor			0
they fear outbreak of ethnic strife in @entity99 and @entity100 , which experienced bloody street riots in 2008 and 2009 , respectively			0
@entity1 's leaders have been trying to ease the pressure			1
" their calculation is that if the government can keep the economy growing and jobs and wages increasing , the legitimacy of the @entity77 will be maintained , " says @entity1 - watcher @entity103			1
" but the challenges of growing social injustice , environmental damage and sustaining high economic growth will continue to haunt the leaders			0
" to avoid its own " jasmine revolution , " @entity0 is taking firm measures to nip dissent in the bud			2
police have detained scores of dissidents , including lawyers and prominent artist @entity123			0
censors block @entity125 and social networking sites like @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			0
at the same time , @entity1 leaders try to project a sense of calm and normalcy			1
party insiders say this tactic is known as neijin waisong -- " tight inside , appearing lax from the outside			0
" at the press conference at the end of the annual session of @entity1 's legislature last month , i asked @entity3 if he thought political reform was urgently needed so the leadership could better address the people 's grievances and avert social unrest			1
the solution , he replied , was political reform -- but reform that is gradual and led by the @entity77			0
" it 's not easy to pursue political restructuring in a country of 1.3 billion people , " he said			0
" it needs to take place in an orderly way , under the leadership of the party			0
" @entity3 added : " at present , i think the biggest danger lies in corruption , and eliminating the breeding ground of corruption needs systemic and structural reform			2
" premier @entity3 is not necessarily pushing for radical political reforms , analysts say			1
instead , says the retired @entity77 official , " he advocates transparency and accountability so as to effectively solve problems , avoid chaos and consolidate the party 's leadership			1
" @entity3 's admirers say he is a reformist at heart			1
however , he sounds like a lonely voice among @entity1 's top leaders			1
@entity178 , chairman of @entity1 's parliament and no. 2 in the party 's hierarchy , in march ruled out the possibility of a multi-party democracy in @entity1			2
says professor @entity35 : " the question is whether @entity3 's effort to promote inner - party democracy will have a spill - over effect on political opposition outside the party			2
his style is different from @entity193 's and other technocrats			0
he is emotional and immensely popular , likes to appear in front of cameras and create sound bites			0
" some observers wonder if @entity3 's pronouncement is just part of a " good cop , bad cop " charade , with @entity3 playing the reform - minded leader and president @entity193 playing the hard liner			2
but there may be one other reason why the 69 - year - old @entity3 feels freer to speak out in recent months			2
his two five - year terms will end in march 2013 , after which he is expected to go into semi-retirement .			0
