@entity0 -- @entity2 has further solidified his control over @entity4 by reportedly purging his uncle @entity5 , vice chairman of the important @entity6			1
although @entity5 was often referred to as the " second most powerful man in @entity4 , " he may now been ousted from the leadership elite for the third time			1
he has twice returned to the inner circle of power , but this cat may now have run out of lives			0
@entity2 's uncle ' probably ' ousted , @entity14 lawmakers say what does the move say about the stability of @entity4 ? some experts perceive a weak , embattled @entity2 feeling forced to fend off challengers			1
but it is more likely that @entity2 's purge of @entity5 -- as well as hundreds of other officials since 2011 -- shows that the @entity4 ruler is firmly in control and confident enough to target even the most senior strata of power			1
like his father and grandfather , @entity2 is playing rivals off against each other to eliminate real or perceived challengers			2
debate rages amongst experts as to why @entity2 felt it necessary to purge his former mentor and protector			2
potential explanations revolve around four ps -- power , parity , people and policy			0
although a classic struggle for power between the leader and potential contenders is a possible explanation , @entity5 had seemed content to play the role of @entity52 minence grise , exercising power behind the throne			1
the best chance for @entity5 to have grabbed the ring of power would have been when @entity2 was weakest immediately after his father 's death in 2011			1
but even then , the young @entity2 was immediately presented as the sole ruler and not as a part of a leadership consortium			2
after @entity2 acquired each of his father 's titles affirming control over the government , military , and party , it became increasingly more difficult for potential challengers to oust him			1
@entity2 more bellicose than his dad was ? then there 's the issue of parity between the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) and the military			1
under @entity78 , power shifted to the military , as the @entity79 became the preeminent center of government power			0
but under his son , the @entity75 has regained some power			0
the @entity75 's @entity85 has now eclipsed the @entity79 as the arbiter of @entity76 policies			0
rather than a struggle to wrest power from @entity2 , the purge may instead result from people fighting for closer access to him			2
there are widespread rumors that @entity5 was defeated in a struggle with personal rivals			1
the least likely explanation for the purge is a debate over policy			0
although @entity5 was often referred to as a " reformer " by the media , there is little evidence that he or any hidden cabal advocated implementing significant economic and political reform or moderating @entity4 's threatening behavior			1
@entity108 created the perception of factions of hardliners and reformers as part of a " good cop - bad cop " strategy to elicit benefits during negotiations			0
as a @entity14 adage warns , " the same animal has soft fur and sharp claws			0
" when @entity2 ascended the throne in 2011 , he was erroneously perceived as a reformer simply because he had spent a few years in @entity125 as a teen			0
the likely departure of his uncle will have little impact on @entity4 policy			1
@entity2 has shown himself to be just as inimical to reform and pursuing a less belligerent foreign policy as his predecessors			2
he showed his willingness to escalate tensions on the @entity136 to dangerous levels earlier this year , threatening nuclear attacks against the @entity139 and @entity14			0
the young leader has also made clear he has no intention of abandoning his regime 's nuclear weapons , even revising the constitution to enshrine @entity4 as a nuclear weapons state			2
@entity108 declared , " those who talk about an economic reward in return for the dismantlement of [ @entity4 's ] nuclear weapons would be well advised to awake from their daydream ... only fools will entertain the delusion that we will trade our nuclear deterrent for petty economic aid			1
" rather than seeking an illusory @entity4 reformer , @entity0 and @entity159 should instead prepare for the extended rule of yet another member of the @entity162 willing to test the resolve of his opponents			0
the opinions expressed in this article are solely those of @entity167 .			0
