-- @entity2 boss @entity1 has called on @entity4 's notoriously argumentative teams to unite and guarantee the future of the sport			1
@entity4 's commercial rights holder @entity8 told @entity0 that the teams had agreed a deal until 2020 to replace the existing @entity11 , which expires at the end of this year , but it has yet to be formally put in place			1
" my fear is that at the moment the deal has n't been done and therefore it adds some volatility to the situation , " @entity1 said on the official @entity4 website			1
" at times @entity4 has lost opportunities because of inner frictions			2
we create dramas out here between us rather than saying , ' hey , this is a fantastic sport , a world sport , and we should all work together and point in the same direction			2
' " @entity1 revealed that most of the teams had signed individual contracts , but he warned that a new @entity33 deal was needed to tie in motorsport 's ruling body the @entity36 and dispel rumors of a breakaway competition			1
@entity8 : i 'll run @entity4 until i die " we must to come to the point of saying @entity4 is big and important to all of us , so in large areas we should be aligned , and if we just can put aside our individual differences and focus on what we all want -- for example to be successful in @entity48 -- then that reflects on all of us , " he said			2
" i hope that there will be a @entity11 that ties it all together because at the moment there are individual contracts			1
if we were not happy with our contract we would n't have signed it , but the danger is that if we all have individual contracts that is probably not aligning us and bringing us together			1
" @entity56 is a tripartite agreement -- teams , commercial rights holder and @entity36			2
it has never been perfect , but it 's a model that before we abandon it we should be very cautious			2
why reinvent something if it functions ? let 's use it			2
" @entity2 , @entity63 and @entity64 are expected to be represented on @entity4 's new extended board but @entity1 said the @entity67 team would not take part until all have signed up			1
" i do n't think that it is a secret anymore that nine teams have signed the contract -- and i really hope that the silver team next door ( @entity76 - based @entity75 ) will sign very shortly and it will be then that we will take up our board position , " he said			1
" we 'd like to see that all the teams have signed before we join the board			1
i think it has to be clear that anyone joining this board is n't there to represent their team interests but try to contribute to @entity4 and take a broader view			2
" it is a phenomenally interesting opportunity			0
we have to come together more effectively -- then we can make it an even better sport in the future			0
" mayor of @entity92 open to capital grand prix @entity1 is head of the @entity94 , which was involved in a bitter row with @entity8 and the @entity36 over the future of @entity4 before finally signing the last @entity11 in 2009			1
@entity63 , @entity64 and @entity97 pulled out in december 2011 , raising the prospect of fresh division among the teams			2
@entity2 and @entity63 are the two most successful teams in @entity4 history , but @entity1 said he was confident they could overcome their differences for the good of the sport			1
" i have a very good relationship with @entity63			0
we 've known them for 30 years now and have been fighting them on the track , in the pit lane , in the paddock , in @entity36 meetings , in court -- everywhere , " he said			0
" i respect that @entity63 is the biggest brand in @entity4			0
and for @entity2 to say that is not something that comes easy			1
but it 's a fact			0
" and the second largest brand in @entity4 is @entity2			1
maybe in 50 years we will be bigger than @entity63 , but at the moment i respect what they represent			0
of course we want to beat each other -- that will never change -- but consent should be possible			0
" @entity126 extends lead with victory from pole in @entity130 @entity63 , without a world title since 2008 , has been dominant this year as @entity126 has overcome the @entity134 marque 's early - season performance problems to lead the championship with three victories from 10 races			0
@entity2 made a strong start as @entity139 won the opening grand prix , but then had to wait until the seventh in @entity142 for the next success when @entity144 came home first			1
the two former world champions are well off the overall pace			0
@entity144 trails by 62 points in fifth while last season 's runnerup @entity139 is 86 points adrift in seventh ahead of this weekend 's @entity155 , after which there will be a month - long break			1
. @entity2 's lack of race pace has led to speculation that @entity144 will not sign a new contract , but @entity1 is confident the @entity67 driver will continue his career - long association with the team			1
" based on what i 've been told and what i 've observed , @entity144 wants to stay with this team and @entity2 very much wants @entity144 to stay , " he said			1
" maybe we are over-comfortable with each other , but we have n't had the urgency to resolve that contract issue , so we all said , ' okay , let 's sort it out in the break			2
' and we are only one week away from the break			2
i suspect that we can resolve it during that period and come back with clarity for the rest of the season			0
" latest @entity4 standings @entity2 's hopes of a first constructors ' crown since 1998 seem slim , trailing @entity64 by 70 points and second - placed @entity63 by 17 at the halfway point " there is a tough development battle going on			1
right now you have to say that @entity63 is the most improved team , " @entity1 said			1
" i think it is also fair to say that sometimes we have severe problems with the tires			0
i would not say that there is anything wrong with the tires , it 's just that we are right at the knife - edge and sometimes it falls the wrong way			0
" there is no doubt that tires have an enormous effect this year -- probably too much in my view -- but , on the other hand , for the fans it has been an incredibly intriguing season so far			0
" @entity1 believes the unpredictability of results -- there were an unprecedented seven winners from the first seven races -- has made the sport more appealing as it looks to enter new markets			1
" we have to connect to younger people , who have got lots of entertainment options apart from sitting in front of the television , " he said			0
" @entity4 is a world sport , of which there are only two -- soccer and @entity4 -- so it is fantastic to see what 's been achieved over the last 30 years			0
and we should be aiming to do it again in the next 30 years			0
" i hope we can capture the imagination in @entity48			0
they are such a huge market , they love cars , and we are the premier motor racing in the world			0
so when we can provide them with entertainment -- and we have a product that is massively exciting -- then i 'm sure we can make it			0
