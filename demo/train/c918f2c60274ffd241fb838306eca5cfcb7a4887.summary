@entity35 , @entity16 's attorney , said the family is " happy and relieved it 's over , but disappointed that it ever got this far			1
" " i , as a lawyer , did n't understand how it could go to a @entity44 51 a investigation , " he told @entity0 , referring to the section of state law that covers such cases			0
" those investigations are reserved for situations where there 's an imminent threat of severe abuse to a child			2
" according to @entity9 , anyone can file a 51 a report , which is an allegation of child abuse and / or neglect ; in fact , she told @entity0 the agency encourages the public to do so			2
