@entity0 -- few issues divide the @entity3 -- and the country at large -- more than church - state matters , and arguments before the @entity3 on wednesday involving a workplace discrimination lawsuit against a lutheran church proved especially touchy			1
at issue is whether the @entity10 applies to hiring and firing decisions involving " ministerial employees " like teachers who may have primarily secular job duties			0
the justices appeared at odds over whether this is substantive discrimination or simple retaliation against a @entity20 teacher , after she complained to government authorities over her treatment on the job			1
" you 're asking for an exemption ( to lawsuits ) so these issues ca n't even be tried " in a government hearing on the merits , said justice @entity24			1
" she was fired simply for asking for a hearing			0
" " it 's none of the business of the government to decide what the substantial interest of the church is , " countered justice @entity33			1
" there , in black and white in the text of the @entity41 , are special protections for religion			0
" court records show @entity46 went on medical leave for narcolepsy in 2004			0
when she tried to return several months later to the @entity50 and @entity51 , officials refused to accept her , saying a substitute had been hired to complete the school year			1
after weeks of often acrimonious discussions between her and the school , @entity46 was fired for insubordination and " regrettable " conduct toward church leaders			1
she then complained to the federal @entity59 , which sued the church on her behalf			1
federal courts have upheld an exception in the @entity64 with @entity10 blocking government intrusion in the employment decisions between religious institutions and ministerial workers			1
the church said @entity46 was just such an employee and therefore the institution could not be sued			1
@entity46 had been hired five years earlier , and eventually became a " called " teacher , meaning she could not be fired without cause			1
assigned to third and fourth grades , she led instruction in math , language arts , social studies , gym and music , with much of the curriculum identical to that of the local public schools			0
@entity46 also taught a religion class four days a week , and engaged in daily prayers and devotionals with her students			0
the religion - based activities typically took up about 45 minutes of the seven - hour school day , according to court documents			2
she also led chapel services with her class twice a year , on a rotation basis with other instructors			0
the faculty has two types of teachers : " lay " employees , who are on one - year contracts , and called teachers like @entity46 , who have completed a formal colloquy , receiving a certificate of admission into the teaching ministry			0
those parochial instructors are hired on an open - ended basis and can not be summarily dismissed without proper justification			2
@entity46 began as a contract teacher , but fulfilled the requirements to be a called teacher , becoming a " commissioned minister " in the @entity50			2
@entity46 attended the one - hour oral arguments at the high court , saying afterward , " i ca n't fathom how the @entity41 in any way can be interpreted to deny me my fundamental rights			2
i hope the court sees it that way			0
" the @entity119 , @entity20 , school is affiliated with the @entity120 , but does not require its teachers to be called , or even @entity120			2
a federal appeals court in @entity123 eventually ruled for @entity46 , saying her primary duties as a teacher were not religious in nature			1
in the oral arguments at the high court , @entity129 , representing the church , said , " government does not set the criteria for selecting and removing officers of the church			2
that 's a bedrock principle			0
" justice @entity136 jumped in			1
" does n't society have a right at some point to say certain conduct is unacceptable , " and deserving of government intervention			1
" we know from the news recently that there was a church whose religious beliefs centered around sexually exploiting women and , i believe , children			1
" she added , " once we say that 's unacceptable , can and why should n't we protect ( from retaliation ) the people who are doing what the law requires , i.e. reporting it ? " arguing for the @entity59 , @entity159 lawyer @entity158 said , " the government 's interest in this case is not in dictating to the church - operated school who it may choose to teach religion classes and who it may not			1
it is one thing and one thing only , which is to tell the school that it may not punish its employees for threatening to report civil wrongs to civil authorities			2
" chief justice @entity176 was incredulous			2
" you 're making a judgment about how important a particular religious belief is to a church , " he told @entity158			1
" you 're saying : we do n't believe the @entity50 when it says that this is an important and central tenet of our faith			1
" @entity158 later suggested the government could not bring action against the @entity186 for its historic policy of men - only priests , but that retaliation claims against the @entity50 in this case are justified			0
but justice @entity191 said any such lawsuit would invariably involve questions of religious doctrine , from which religious groups would be constitutionally insulated from any claims			2
" i ca n't reconcile your position on those two issues without coming to the conclusion that you think that the @entity186 doctrine is older , stronger and entitled to more respect than the @entity120 doctrine , " he said			0
the @entity41 's @entity203 bars any government from passing laws " respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof			0
" the high court in the past has typically dealt with such church - state disputes by allowing ten commandment displays in public buildings ; the mention of " @entity216 " on currency and in the @entity218 ; manger and menorah displays in public parks ; and school and legislature prayer			1
legal experts say federal courts have been split on the current issue , and it gives the justices a rare opportunity to explore a religious freedom dispute from an employment context			0
several dozen supporting briefs supporting both sides have been filed by religious and civil liberty organizations , employment groups , and eight other states			0
six members of the high court are catholic , the other three are @entity240			0
the case is @entity46 ( 10 - 553 )			0
a ruling is expected early next year .			0

a former teacher wants to sue the church school that dismissed her
the @entity247 and @entity51 says it is *immune* from such suits
@entity136 : " does n't society have a right " to *censure* " certain conduct ? "
chief *roberts* : the @entity59 is judging " how important a *...* religious belief is to a church "
