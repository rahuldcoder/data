@entity1 gov. @entity0 lobbied for construction of the @entity3 during a trip to @entity5 on thursday , staking out a position popular with @entity7 and business groups ahead of a potential 2016 bid for the @entity10			1
in a speech at the @entity12 , the @entity7 criticized president @entity14 's administration for allowing the pipeline to languish at the @entity16 for six years without a decision on its approval			1
" my view is that we are missing an enormous opportunity when we delay its development , " he said of the 1,179 - mile pipeline that would stretch from @entity5 through @entity20 to the @entity21 in a prepared text provided by his office			1
he cited the @entity16 's environmental study , saying it had concluded the pipeline " would be safe , " and pointed to 42,000 jobs that its construction would create			2
many of those jobs , @entity0 acknowledged , would be temporary , but he said they 're still needed			2
" this is no way to treat a friend , " @entity0 said			2
" this is not about sending ' your oil ' across ' our land			0
' it 's about maximizing the benefits of @entity47 's natural resources for everybody , about allowing markets to function , and about contributing to the prosperity of citizens of both the @entity52 and in @entity5			0
" @entity0 's @entity5 trip comes on the heels of his visit to @entity57 in september			1
the travel and the year the @entity1 @entity7 just spent as @entity60 chairman have given him opportunities to elevate his profile and connect with key donors ahead of his decision on whether to seek the @entity7 's 2016 presidential nomination			1
the speech comes just weeks before @entity68 is likely to take up the @entity3 pipeline again			1
incoming senate majority leader @entity70 ( @entity71			0
) has pledged a vote to authorize the project shortly after new @entity7 lawmakers are sworn in next month , setting up a showdown with @entity14 , whose administration has signaled he might veto such a bill			0

during his two - day trip he 's also expected to meet with @entity5 prime minister @entity81 and visit @entity82 and @entity83			0
@entity0 highlighted @entity52 - @entity5 trade figures			2
he called on @entity68 to approve legislation that would fast - track approval of a new pact between @entity5 , the @entity52 and 10 other @entity89 countries , covering a host of new issues -- including intellectual property rights and environmental and labor rules -- that were n't addressed in as much depth in the @entity96			2
he touted the " @entity47 model " of cooperation , and the " extraordinary neighborhood that we live in " -- with similar political systems and cultural values			0
but most of his remarks were focused on the @entity3 pipeline			1
during a press conference with @entity78 on thursday , @entity0 said @entity3 would be a " reliable and secure source of energy from a friendly neighbor and trading partner is something that is going to be a benefit to everyone in the @entity52 , including the people of @entity1			1
" he batted away a question about whether dropping oil prices have undercut the need for the @entity3 pipeline			1
" you can not make major national policy decisions based upon the oil price of the day			0
we know from our own experience that oil prices will fluctuate and change up and down , " he said			0
" this provides us with another foundational piece for strengthening the geopolitical position for @entity47			0
