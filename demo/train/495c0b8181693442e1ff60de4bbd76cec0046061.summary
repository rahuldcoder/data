-- there are guy movies and girl movies , the latter of which the guys label " chick flicks " and often only ever see under protest			0
in " @entity10 " the late @entity9 had fun with the idea that for a typical guy , the definition of a tearjerker would be " @entity18 " ( because that 's about as emotional as we fellas want to get )			0
is " @entity20 " a chick flick ? if it is , it may the first of a new breed			1
it 's a crisp , unsentimental story , with none of those lingering sunset shots you find in @entity28 ' adaptations ( well , ok , almost none ) , and a heroine who spends most of the movie tutting her disapproval on the sidelines			2
but for sure , women are going to be this film 's primary audience			2
why ? because @entity20 ( @entity37 ) is a stripper , and so is his mentor , club owner @entity39 ( @entity41 ) , and his 19 - year - old @entity42 © , @entity43 ( @entity44 )			1
just a hunch , but i reckon a lot of guys are going to hold out for " @entity49 " next week			0
director @entity51 's last movie was the female action film " @entity53 , " which did n't click with audiences of either sex			1
but he may be on to something this time			0
it 's a good year to be @entity37 from the opening shots of a buff , naughty @entity41 teasing the audience in tight leather trousers ( " what ca n't you touch ? " ) , it 's clear that @entity51 has the measure of what his audience wants			1
he 's going to give it to them , too , but not too much , too soon because the tease is as important as the strip			0
a college dropout who draws the line at taking any job that requires him to wear a tie , @entity43 is living with his big sister @entity77 ( @entity78 ) when his new buddy @entity20 ushers him into the delights of the @entity81			2
in time - honored backstage musical tradition , " the kid " gets thrown on stage when one of the stars ca n't go on			0
next thing he knows , @entity43 is shopping for a stars and stripes thong for the @entity90 special			0
scripted by @entity91 and inspired by @entity37 's own experiences as a @entity94 stripper in the 1990s , " @entity20 " is honest about the attractions of the job ( money , girls , fun ) without pretending it 's a smart choice in the long run ( too much fun , too many girls , not enough money )			1
i liked the brightly lit , casual camaraderie of the dressing room scenes , while on stage the routines here are sexy , playful and ( i 'm guessing ) much better choreographed than you 're likely to see downtown on a saturday night			0
brawny and bruised , @entity37 does n't look like it but he is a heck of a dancer			2
if the movie was in @entity125 you 'd probably be stuffing bills into his briefs , bills like the ones we see @entity20 flattening under a heavy book in one of the film 's numerous truthful touches			1
less interesting is @entity20 's haphazard courtship of @entity77			1
is it a coincidence that @entity78 is the daughter of @entity134 president @entity133 ? i have no idea , but she 's a bland performer and the weak link here ( @entity139 blows her away as a slumming psychology student who is @entity20 's substitute girl ) .			1

@entity37 plays a stripper and @entity41 a club owner in " @entity20 "
director @entity51 's last movie was the female action film " @entity53 "
the movie is inspired by @entity37 's experiences as a @entity94 stripper in the 1990s
