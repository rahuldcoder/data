the @entity1 government has transferred five more @entity3 detainees , shrinking the number to 127			1
the detainees , two @entity6 and three @entity7 , were repatriated to @entity8 , after the @entity9 said it determined the men did not pose security threats			1
the @entity12 identified the men as @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , and @entity16			0
the move advances president @entity19 's goal of drawing down the number of those held at the @entity1 naval base in southeastern @entity23 , something that has been ongoing for years			2
the departures of the five men means that 127 people are still detained at @entity3			1
this is down significantly from the numbers soon after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , when the facility widely known as @entity32 was repurposed to hold detainees from the " war on terror			2
" the administration of then - president @entity36 claimed that , since @entity32 detainees were n't held on @entity1 soil , they could be considered " enemy combatants " and be denied some legal protections			1
almost all of the nearly 800 detainees were held without charges			1
this legal limbo , as well as allegations of torture and other mistreatment , spurred criticism of @entity32			0
shortly after his 2009 inauguration , president @entity19 signed an executive order to close the detention facility within a year			0
one reason was because of strong opposition from lawmakers , many of them @entity55 , who cited the risk of freeing men who had fought to kill @entity1			0
about 17 % of the 620 @entity32 detainees released -- most of them during @entity36 's presidency -- went on to engage in terrorist activities , a september semiannual report from the director of national intelligence found			0
another 12 % are suspected of having engaged in terrorist or insurgent activities .			0

two @entity6 and three @entity7 transferred
@entity3 has held nearly 800 detainees
