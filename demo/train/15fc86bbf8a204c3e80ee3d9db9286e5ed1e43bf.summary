president @entity0 told three people who repeatedly interrupted his latest speech on immigration to stop their yelling because he " just took an action to change the law			1
" @entity0 was in @entity8 on tuesday night to tout an executive order halting deportations for the undocumented parents of children born in the @entity13			1
but -- as has been the pattern in recent months -- he could n't get through the speech without being heckled by protesters who want bolder action			1
about 20 minutes into the speech , three women -- one standing four rows behind @entity0 , holding a sign reading " stop deportations now , " and the other two in the crowd -- shouted a series of complaints			0
related : @entity0 : ' no sympathy for violence in @entity28 one called @entity0 's claim that his immigration policies are focused on deporting felons , not families , " a lie			2
" another said it 's " not just @entity37 " who have called undocumented immigrants felons			0
@entity0 told the protesters it " does n't make sense to yell at me right now , " given his immigration action last week			2
" what you 're not paying attention to is , i just took an action to change the law , " he said as the crowd applauded			0
the interruptions continued , with @entity0 saying at one point that he 's " not going to be able to have a conversation with each of you separately " and later that they should " just sit down			0
" @entity0 tackles immigration , @entity28 at hometown rally " nobody 's removing you			0
but you 've got to listen to me , too , " he said			0
@entity0 's claim that he " took an action to change the law , " though , could fuel more complaints from congressional @entity37 and governors in states like @entity68 who have accused the president of overstepping his constitutional bounds			1
@entity68 governor - elect @entity72 is readying a legal challenge to @entity0 's executive order , while @entity37 lawmakers consider using spending bills this december to cut funding for the agencies that would implement @entity0 's order			1
@entity0 has shot back that @entity81 republicans who object to his action should pass an immigration reform bill ; he 's endorsed one approved by the @entity85 in 2013 .			2
