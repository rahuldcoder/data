@entity0 , @entity1 -- a lawyer for @entity4 said thursday the only option for the jury considering her murder appeal in @entity1 is to clear her of guilt			1
@entity10 's lawyers gave their final arguments in @entity0 thursday in an effort to counter prosecutors ' portrayal of her as a cunning " femme fatale			2
" lawyer @entity17 told the jury ' that the only possible decision to take is that of absolving @entity4 , " as he wrapped up his closing argument			1
he said the court had already seen " there is not trace of @entity4 in the room where murder took place			0
" @entity10 and her former boyfriend @entity28 are fighting to overturn their 2009 convictions for the murder of @entity33 , @entity10 's @entity35 housemate who was found with her throat slashed two years earlier			1
the judge said there will be no ruling in the case until after defendant statements on monday			2
the second of @entity10 's lawyers to speak , @entity43 , said @entity10 was " very afraid but her heart is full of hope and she hopes to return to freedom			1
" her " image was massacred " by the media and the attacks on her character started before the trial , he said , adding that he considered her as a daughter			0
concluding an emotional appearance , he appealed to the jury to put themselves in the shoes of @entity10 's family -- a counterpoise to the words of appeals court prosecutor @entity62 , who asked the jury to put themselves in the shoes of @entity66 's family at the start of the closing arguments a week ago			1
the " @entity10 " -- as @entity10 's family have been referred to -- are not part of some rumored @entity71 conspiracy to put pressure on the @entity1 courts to release her , @entity43 said			2
rather , " they are parents and they deserve respect			0
" the lawyer also praised the court 's work , saying he felt @entity10 's rights had finally been respected			1
urging the jury not to let innocent people stay in jail , @entity17 earlier detailed what he called many " mistakes " made in the investigation into @entity66 's death			0
when @entity10 was arrested and interrogated , she was not allowed a translator and was discouraged from getting a lawyer , @entity17 said			1
" ' that night @entity4 's right to defend herself was denied , " he said			0
" she was just a young girl , first time out of the country			0
she did n't speak @entity1			0
" @entity17 argued that some of the dna evidence presented by the prosecution should be thrown out			0
he said some material was contaminated as a result of poor practice by police , including supposed traces of mixed blood in the bathroom sink shared by the two girls			0
the prosecution 's use of alleged bloody footprints in their case was also wrong , he said			0
as for the knife used to kill @entity66 , a key piece of evidence , @entity17 told the court there was a " concentration of nothingness , a fantasy " in the prosecution 's arguments			0
he ridiculed a theory that @entity28 had not disposed of the knife because he was concerned his landlady would notice it was missing , asking : " what kind of a killer would think about this after committing a murder ? " @entity17 claimed forensics experts who examined computers belonging to @entity10 and @entity28 had destroyed the machines and with them evidence that was certain to be favorable to the defendants			1
this included photographs of @entity10 and @entity66 together that demonstrated they were friends , he said			2
showing the court panoramic pictures of the villa @entity10 shared with @entity66 , @entity17 rejected the prosecution claim that a fake robbery had been staged by someone inside the house to try to cover up what had happened			2
he also suggested the original court had taken sides over some of the evidence , choosing to accept as credible some witnesses whose testimony went against @entity10 and rejecting others who were in her favor			0
@entity10 's attorneys ' statements follow arguments presented this week by the lawyer of her co-defendant			1
lawyer @entity158 said tuesday that @entity10 is not the character the media has painted her to be , and urged a jury to acquit @entity10 and @entity28 of murdering @entity66			1
@entity158 compared @entity10 to the voluptuous cartoon character @entity164 , who protests , " i 'm not bad , i 'm just drawn that way , " in the movie " @entity167 ? " @entity158 said the whole trial was based on dna evidence " on which mistakes were made , " and urged the jury to " abandon imagined fantasies " and acquit the pair			2
@entity10 and @entity28 were convicted in 2009			1
@entity10 was sentenced to 26 years in prison , while @entity28 got 25			1
in her closing arguments , @entity175 said there was no physical trace of @entity10 or @entity28 in the room where @entity66 was found murdered			1
" the room speaks only of @entity183 , the other man convicted separately of killing @entity66 , @entity158 told the jury			2
@entity10 and @entity28 's defense teams have suggested @entity183 , who is already serving a 16 - year sentence for the murder , could have been the sole killer			1
evidence that @entity183 was in the room shows that " no one could enter that room and not leave any trace , " @entity158 said			0
and she hammered home attacks on dna evidence that has been a key part of the appeal			0
she , too , said police could have contaminated the crime scene or the evidence , playing video from the police investigation to make her point			0
@entity10 and @entity28 are appealing the convictions together , having been convicted in a joint trial			1
@entity2 's @entity203 contributed to this report .			0
