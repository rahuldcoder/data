-- it took less than 10 seconds to bring a steel , 345 - ton relic of the @entity5 era crashing to the ground in the @entity8 desert wednesday			1
the 1,527 - foot - tall @entity9 was the tallest free - standing structure west of the @entity11			1
it was also the tallest structure of its kind ever demolished , according to the @entity14			1
the tower stood taller than the @entity16 ( 1,454 feet ) and the @entity17 ( 1,063 feet )			2
it was also taller than the iconic @entity19 ( 1,148 feet ) on the @entity20			0
originally constructed in 1962 , the @entity9 took its name from the nuclear radiation experiment for which it was built : @entity24			1
@entity9 was designed to provide a way for scientists to accurately estimate radiation doses received by survivors of the atomic bombs detonated over the @entity31 cities of @entity32 during @entity33 the tower stood 1,527 feet tall because that was the height at which " @entity36 , " the first atomic bomb used in warfare , was detonated over @entity35 on august 6 , 1945			1
to conduct research at the time , engineers mounted a small unshielded ( bare ) reactor on the tower and built a mock @entity31 village near the base of the tower			2
the mock village was intended to simulate the shielding effects that rooftops and walls had on radiation , according to @entity51 , public affairs manager for the @entity52			2
scientists used the research to estimate radiation doses residents of @entity35 and @entity56 were subjected to when the bomb detonated			1
according to the @entity52 , the data became a cornerstone of modern radiation research			1
the tower stood in a rural area about 65 miles north of @entity20 on the @entity52			0
the enormous proving ground is larger than the state of @entity65			0
in 1992 the @entity67 government stopped full - scale nuclear testing on the site			2
despite its height , in 1966 the @entity67 government decided to move the tower to a different location at a cost of $ 380,000			0
the move was made so scientists could conduct further experiments using @entity9 while not disrupting underground nuclear testing in the area , according to the @entity52			0
@entity79 used for research in 1999 , in recent years the tower fell into disrepair			1
the beacons used to alert commercial aviation at the top of the tower had failed , and the elevator used by workers to ascend to the top was no longer safely reliable			0
it would have cost close to $ 1 million to repair the tower to its original state			0
wednesday 's demolition cost about half of what it would have cost to repair the tower .			0

@entity100 was the tallest free - standing structure west of the @entity11
@entity103 was used to estimate radiation doses received by @entity33 nuke survivors
@entity100 was last used for research in 1999
