the rise in antibiotic - resistant bacteria could lead to a future full of untreatable infections , experts have warned us for years			1
now the @entity7 administration is stepping up its efforts to combat the rising problem of antibiotic resistance			1
the president signed an executive order thursday establishing a new inter-agency task force charged with developing a national strategy to combat antibiotic - resistant bacteria			1
dr. @entity15 , director of the @entity16 and assistant to the president , said the problem is a serious challenge to public health and national security			1
" we are clearly in a fight against ... bacteria where no permanent treatment is possible			2
" when you need antibiotics -- and when you do n't the task force will be co-chaired by the secretaries of @entity28 , the @entity29 and the @entity30			1
the task force must submit its national action plan to the president by february 15 , 2015			1
the order also established a @entity35 made up of nongovernmental experts who will provide advice and recommendations to strengthen surveillance of infections , research new treatments and develop alternatives to antibiotics for use in agriculture			0

the president 's @entity54 -- known as @entity56 -- also released a report on combating antibiotic resistance			1
there are three main components to the report : improve surveillance of antibiotic - resistant bacteria and stop outbreaks ; increase the life of current antibiotics and develop new ones , as well as promote research accelerating clinical trials ; and increase economic incentives to develop new antibiotics			1
in fact , a $ 20 million prize will be given to spur development of tests health care professionals can use to identify highly resistant bacterial infections			2
" what 's new here is there is a highly federal focus that 's highly coordinated , " said dr. @entity77 , co-chair of @entity56			0
" we are endorsing a variety of specific goals in order to get our arms around this problem			2
if we 're producing antibiotics at a greater rate than we 're losing them , then we win in the long run			0
" each year 23,000 deaths and 2 million illnesses are linked to antibiotic - resistant infections , according to the @entity95			1
the agency estimates the impact to the economy is as high as $ 20 billion in direct health care costs			0
last year , for the first time , the @entity95 classified drug - resistant superbugs by how dangerous they were			1
they were ranked " urgent , " " serious " and " concerning " based on how many people get sick , the number of hospitalizations and how many deaths were attributed to them			0
" if we can target our efforts more effectively , " @entity95 director dr. @entity106 said , " we can help doctors use antibiotics more wisely			0
" dr. @entity111 , director of the @entity112 at @entity113 , says antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing global public health threats			1

he says investment in new treatments must be paired with the sensible use of new and existing antibiotics			0
" @entity126 will require a sea change			0
doctors , farmers and agribusiness , health systems and the public all need to think totally differently about antibiotics , " @entity111 said			2
" they are precious resources and we must reduce their inappropriate use			0
better diagnosis and stronger infection control practices can make a big difference right now			0
