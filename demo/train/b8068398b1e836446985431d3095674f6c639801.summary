editor 's note : @entity2 is the chief content officer of @entity3 and the editor - in - chief of @entity3			1
@entity2 says @entity5 sacrificed himself in the name of his art. ( @entity8 ) -- it falls to me to prepare a statement on behalf of @entity3 when someone is promoted , when there is trouble , or when something major happens in the world of pop. it occasionally falls to me to write an obituary or a tribute when an entertainer dies			1
it 's a part of my job			2
one has to do it quickly , and i 've never been prepared			2
yet i 've been prepping for this one my whole life			2
@entity5 has died at the age of 50			1
the sorrow at his passing is palpable , and wet , and illogical -- in my 20 years of being a critic and an editor , i 've never met him			2
but this is a death in the family			2
i 've known @entity5 's work since i was 5 years old and was given @entity36 's " @entity35 " as a gift			1
he was on the surface the most uncomplicated of all boys -- beautiful , emotional , untouchable , ours			2
@entity5 has bruised my heart many times -- his antics and the accusations , his seeming desire not to be , at least physically , who he 'd been			1
which is who i am			2
but as his funeral is prepared , i , like the @entity5 brothers sang with optimistic melancholy in 1976 , think about the good times			1
there is no moonwalk down memory lane about @entity5			1
the legends mix in with the rumors mix in with the ice - cold facts of 1960s black working - class @entity58			0
that mixes in with girls fainting at the sight of him when he was barely a teenager ; which mixes with the many sold - out tours , and with @entity5 collaborating with @entity67 on 1979 's " @entity69 " and 1982 's " @entity68			1
" there is the alleged abuse inflicted on @entity5 and his brothers by his father , @entity73 , along with the strong love and late rivalry with his superstar sister , @entity76			1
there is the magic and melodrama of @entity80			0
the accusation of child abuse ( no charge ; he agreed to a settlement in a lawsuit against him in 1994 ) , and the 2005 trial in which @entity5 was acquitted of child molestation and other heinous charges			1
there is the drastic change of his skin color , the radical narrowing of his nose , the short marriage to @entity98 's daughter , the friendship with @entity100 , the @entity101 , the 13 no. 1 singles , the two inductions into the @entity104 , and the haunting , otherworldly performance at @entity80 's 25th anniversary special			0
the way he integrated @entity112 in 1983 with " @entity113 , " the " @entity121 " extravaganzas , the face masks , the oxygen tanks , the @entity117 -- all that mixes in with everything from " stop the @entity119 " to " @entity120 , " " @entity108 , " " @entity107 , " " @entity109 , " adding up to the more than 750 million albums sold worldwide ... i mean			0
and this is not the half , the tenth , the thousandth of what he was			0
it comes down to the fact that @entity5 gave			1
whether he chose to or did it because it was all he knew , he sacrificed himself in the name of his art. @entity5 gave almost his entire life on this planet to singing , to dancing , to recording , to performing			1
he practiced , he watched @entity137 and @entity138 and @entity139 and he watched his brothers			0
he bent , when he had to , to the will of those who could have done better by him			0
he was knowing enough about who he was to pretty much demand we all call him @entity5 , but it was the public shyness , the nerdiness of @entity5 that endeared			1
the whispery voice juxtaposed with the explosive grace he demonstrated on stage and on record			0
the tenderness , especially of his childhood work , and of " @entity69 , " that seduced , and that inspired loyalty			0
he made me a believer			2
i saw @entity36 in 1981 in @entity158 on the @entity160 tour , sat in the nosebleeds and was living a dream			0
it was ecstasy , for what i know of it -- unadulterated joy at witnessing			0
i saw @entity166 in 1972 at the @entity167 in @entity168 , @entity169			0
my mother got tickets for herself , my sister and me for my 7th birthday			0
what moves a heart ? what makes a fan ? i deserted my family and dashed toward the revolving stage			0
i told people until i was in my teens that @entity5 touched my hand			1
i know he did n't			0
i never got close , i was 7 and my mother grabbed me back			0
i know he did n't touch me , but he did touch me			0
is it as simple as saying that an era has closed , that part of our childhood and teen years has died with him , that we have to face true adulthood with its adult contemporary radio formats , logical love , and guided tours through @entity117 ? is the world grieving @entity5 , or mourning for a time when such earnest fandom was possible ? @entity5 was truly something rare , the last of an endangered species			1
that he is the best entertainer who ever lived i will argue for life , and i come from an @entity98 and @entity80 household			1
ireport.com : share your favorite memory of @entity5 in his absolute prime ( 1974 - 1986 ) there was no holding back			1
@entity5 had a sense of humor , but there was little he did , as a performer , with a wink or a nod to himself at our expense			1
he sometimes got tired of singing " @entity35 , " and the ditties of his ( and my ) childhood , but he was working			0
it 's a dying art. we took and take pride in it			0
for a time , with the white gloves and flooding pants and loafers and odd military jackets , we emulated it			0
he gave himself to the world			2
and @entity5 left nothing but @entity230			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity5 made millions believe
she says he gave almost all of his life to entertaining others
@entity2 : he sacrificed and left nothing but @entity230
