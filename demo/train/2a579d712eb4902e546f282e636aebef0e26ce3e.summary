-- politicians and historians love to use the word " crossroads			2
" it 's become as @entity6 , and cliched , as " @entity8 's apple pie			1
" the historian @entity9 , wrote , " the @entity10 defined us as what we are and it opened us to being what we became , good and bad things			2
... it was the crossroads of our being , and it was a hell of a crossroads			2
" i have been thinking about the word , because this year 's @entity22 theme is " at the @entity23 : the @entity24 and the march on @entity25			1
" two pivotal events that shaped modern @entity6 history			1
a " crossroads " is literally the intersection of two or more roads -- two or more paths to get to the same place			2
metaphorically , it refers to the place -- the moment -- of a critical decision			2
shall we go forward together ? shall we separate ? shall we fight ? we mark history 's crossroads not by road signs but by the documents that identify them			1
the @entity43 is certainly one			0
who has not memorized the opening of the second paragraph ? " we hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are @entity51			0
" political philosopher @entity53 's original term was , " life , liberty , and property			0
" @entity57 borrowed the phrase , changing " property " to " the pursuit of happiness			0
" he understood that " happiness " -- being significant -- was more important than property , and that a " right to property " too often meant a " right " to own someone else , i.e. slavery			0
@entity53 rejected the " divine right of kings			0
" he argued instead that @entity70 invested each person with an innate equality -- the right to be on this @entity74 and to be free -- free to pursue dreams			0
on the way to his first inauguration , @entity76 stopped at @entity79 in @entity80 to celebrate @entity25 's birthday			1
he told the assembled crowd , " i have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the @entity43			0
" @entity76 's issuance of the @entity24 in 1863 was another crossroads , one that required @entity76 , and the nation , to walk a long road of personal and national growth			1
" all men are created equal " had to take on a deeper meaning			0
@entity95 , one of @entity76 's " guides " on his journey , later said the quality he most admired in @entity99 was his political courage			0
@entity102 president @entity101 once acknowledged to an @entity104 writer that @entity76 's @entity24 resulted in the self - liberation of " two millions of our slaves			1
" a journey of a hundred years brought us to another crossroads -- the 1963 march on @entity25			1
while " property in man " no longer existed , millions of @entity6 were unable to pursue their dream , or to live with full equality			1
@entity115 , a leading civil rights activist who was in jail in my home state of @entity119 , sent a message to the quarter - million in attendance that summer day , saying his people would not be free " until the dogs stop biting us in the @entity124 and the rats stop biting us in the @entity126			0
" @entity127 's " @entity129 " speech , like the @entity130 , resonates			0
it echoes through the years in the heartbeats of @entity6			1
the " pursuit of happiness " is more than pleasure , for we often take great pains in the pursuit			0
rather , the pursuit of happiness is the freedom to pursue our dreams , to make meaning in and find the unique significance of our lives			0
that is something we can only do when , in the bonds of fellowship and shared history , we nurture our dreams			0
the caged bird sings of freedom , but the freed bird sings of dreams			0
today , we are 150 years further down the road to realizing the @entity6 creed of equality and freedom			1
we reached a crossroads in 2008 with the election of our first @entity159 - @entity6 president			1
we chose to continue on the road to a " post-racial " society			1
we 're not there yet			2
but in 2012 , when we could have chosen to travel down another road , one that led to further economic inequality , we chose instead to continue the realization of equality and freedom , and to the unfettered pursuit of dreams for each @entity6			1
in some ways , the re-election of president @entity170 is more significant than his election four years ago			1
i say this not because i 'm a @entity174 , but because this time , the dog - whistles of racism were called out and condemned by people of faith and goodwill on both sides of the aisle			0
during the next four years , we 'll come to more crossroads			2
i pray , and believe , we will take the road to freedom and equality for each child , man and woman in @entity6			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			2

@entity191 : @entity22 themed crossroads , " tied to two pivotal @entity6 events
@entity24 , march on @entity25 were crossroads , she says
she says crossroad decisions are *threaded* along @entity6 road to post-racial society
@entity191 : we 're not there yet , but re-election of @entity170 a *harbinger*
