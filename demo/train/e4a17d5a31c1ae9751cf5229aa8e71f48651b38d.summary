@entity9 was in exile in @entity30 , @entity31 , when the shah fled @entity2 in 1979			2
he appointed @entity1 to represent him on an @entity33 , alongside other key figures such as ayatollah @entity35			1
the appointment may have been a career - making moment for @entity1 , who was a fairly low - level scholar at the time , said @entity2 analyst @entity39 , a visiting scholar at @entity40 in @entity41			1
learn more about @entity2 's recent history " he is not qualified to be an ayatollah , " or top - ranking @entity33 scholar , she said , saying he had picked up the title by dint of succeeding @entity9 as supreme leader , " like an honorary doctorate			1
" @entity1 , now 70 , was briefly minister of defense and head of @entity2 's @entity52 in the early 1980s before becoming president , a post he held from 1982 to 1990			1
in power , he clashed ideologically with @entity35 , favoring a more left - wing politics than @entity35 , who came from a more bourgeois background than the poor @entity1			2
he also locked horns with the man who was prime minister when he was president -- @entity61 , now the most prominent opposition leader			1
the two had similar anti-american , left - wing politics but struggled over power in what @entity65 called " the two - headed monster " that was then the @entity2 political structure			2
" there were turf battles between the president and the prime minister , " she said			1
@entity9 died in 1989 , and @entity1 was appointed the next supreme leader			2
the post of prime minister was abolished			1
@entity35 seems to have been a " kingmaker " in the elevation of @entity1 to the top job , @entity65 said , perhaps thinking he would be the power behind the throne			0
but with time , @entity1 has become his own man , she said			0
@entity35 was president in the 1990s , but lost a comeback attempt in 2005 -- defeated by current president @entity83			0

he appoints the @entity87 , the country 's election authority			0
he also appoints key posts in the intelligence services and the armed forces , including the powerful @entity52			0
additionally , he confirms the president 's election			0
in theory , the supreme leader is appointed by a body of clerics whom voters elect			0
but in practice , this body -- the assembly of experts -- has answered to the supreme leader			0
@entity1 's authority has been challenged at times			2
nearly half the members of @entity2 's parliament criticized him openly in 2004 for ordering general elections to go ahead despite a widespread belief that they would not be free or fair			1
the elections took place as scheduled			0
@entity1 supports the country 's controversial nuclear program , and when president @entity114 reached out directly to the people of @entity2 with a video message , it was @entity1 who responded			1
@entity1 said in march he saw no change in @entity120 policy toward @entity2 despite @entity114 's promise of a " new beginning			1
" he said a change in rhetoric was not enough , and @entity41 must practice what it preaches , according to the @entity127 - language press tv channel in @entity2			2
he hailed the disputed @entity2 presidential election as " a miracle " for the record turnout , but that very public enthusiasm for the election may signal a shift that @entity1 failed to anticipate			1
" he has now very much become his own man , but the country has changed , " @entity65 said			0
" look at the women 's situation			0
they make a big deal out of saying how many women they have educated			0
