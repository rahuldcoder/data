@entity0 -- @entity2 burst onto the music scene in @entity4 26 years ago with his signature number , " @entity6			1
" he was one of the first @entity4 musicians to bring rock ' n roll to @entity4 during the 1980s as the country began to open up to western influences			1
he is still making waves today with his fusion of western and @entity4 styles			1
" the essence of rock n ' roll is energy and personality , " he told his fans who gathered in @entity0 this week to commemorate his breakout performance			1
" the burst of energy in the artistic creation comes from the suppression of personality			2
" the invited guests had just watched a special screening of " @entity26 , " a 3 - d video of @entity29 's recent concert with the @entity30 , which will be released later this summer			2
organizers gave each guest a piece of red cloth			0
some tied it on their arms , others on their foreheads -- a nod to the red blindfold @entity42 often wore when he sang his politically - charged love song , " a piece of @entity45			1
" his supporters were left heady with nostalgia			0
" that time , we really had nothing , " recalled @entity49 , producer of the 70 - minute video			0
" we had no fridge , no camera , no cell phone , nothing			0
but we were full of spirit			0
today , we are much better off but we feel have lost something			0
" sometimes amusing , sometimes plaintive but often overtly political , @entity42 's songs challenged conventional @entity4 ideas and attitudes			1
some commentators interpret his songs as allegorical reminders of authoritarian control			2
the mournful " @entity74 , " or " @entity6 , " captured the frustrations and idealism of the 1980s generation , as @entity71 's policies of economic and cultural liberalization resulted in some foreign culture seeping into @entity4			1
the character in the love song beseeches his girlfriend to accept him , even though he has nothing to his name			2
the song struck a chord with many			2
@entity82 was 16 when she first heard @entity42 's songs			1
" i was in high school , when boys were forbidden to wear long hair or bell bottom pants and girls were forbidden to wear colorful clothes , " she said			0
" nobody heard of @entity91 or hard rock			2
everybody went crazy when we first heard @entity2 's songs			1
it was a break from tradition			0
" over the years , i 've watched @entity2 -- " @entity99 " or " @entity29 " ( @entity100 ) to friends -- perform in concerts , big and small , often belting out songs with a symbolic red band tied over his eyes			1
i also remember seeing @entity108 duo @entity106 ! in 1985 , one of the the first gigs by a major rock n ' roll group in @entity4			1
during the performance at @entity0 's @entity113 , most of the 10,000 people in the audience sat riveted in their chairs , watching with shock and awe as the long - haired rockers pranced on stage singing " @entity122			2
" such music , like @entity42 's , would have been unthinkable during the @entity124 ( 1966 - 76 ) , when foreign culture was branded as " spiritual pollution			1
" " @entity128 music was not considered serious , " @entity42 recalled			1
" it was for people who drink , meet girls , take drugs and do n't want to work on a schedule			0
" in his teens , @entity42 was not destined to become a rock singer			1
his father was a professional trumpet player and his mother a member of a @entity140 minority dance troupe			0
he himself started learning trumpet at age 14 , playing mostly classical pieces			0
in the early 1980s , however , he began listening to western rock n ' roll on cassette tapes he bought or borrowed from foreign friends			1
inspired by @entity148 , he learned the guitar , formed a band and started performing in public			1
during the @entity156 protests in 1989 , students on hunger strike on the square adopted @entity157 ( nothing to my name ) as their anthem			1
at the height of the protests , @entity42 even gave an impromptu performance in the square			1
two decades later , his loyal fans are still inspired by him			2
" we are still yiwu suoyou in our mind , " said @entity82 , a white collar worker in @entity0			0
" we have money , a house , a car but in terms of spirit we are yiwu suoyou			0
" @entity42 is known today as the grandfather of @entity4 rock n ' roll			1
however , many @entity4 are not aware of who he is			1
observers say this is in part because he has fundamentally refused to compromise his art for commercial or political gain			0
" he is a pioneer , " said @entity183 , a prominent @entity4 blogger			1
" he has an ideal and he sticks to it			0
he 's the least corrupted star i know			2
everyone else will sell their soul for a few pennies in a hurry			0
" but @entity42 , now 51 , has mellowed too , willing to make small compromises			2
" in this 3 - d film , some lines had to be taken off and some songs were disallowed , " he told his supporters , referring to the hand of the @entity4 authorities			1
" we have had to remove them to save the whole work			0
such compromise is made so we can deliver the other messages			0
we hope everyone can understand that			0
" still , he bats for artistic freedom			0
" if by simply telling the truth of people 's sufferings , an act is considered as anti-stability or anti-system , then it 's absolutely wrong			2
change is inevitable , so why not make it happen as soon as possible ? " " it took us almost two years to finish the 3 - d film , " said producer @entity49			0
" i feel this is what @entity4 needs now			2
i want this film to deliver this message , whether we have changed the world or whether the changed world has changed us			0
" @entity226 contributed to this story .			0
