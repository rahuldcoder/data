-- when photography first became a method to document events , both large and small , more than a century ago , there was a certain understanding that what one was seeing in a picture was more or less what happened			1
the ability to use photography to recount life in a visual way and replicate it in the mass media allowed people around the world to see and understand things they may only have imagined before			1
the " truth " of photography , embodied by the phrase " the camera does n't lie , " was something that came to be generally accepted			1
yet the camera , like most tools used by people , is more than capable of lying if used in the wrong way			2
a picture is simply a moment , and although we might think we can divine what it is we are looking at , there are times when a visual representation of life is simply neither the whole truth , nor nothing but the truth			1
increasingly , with the ubiquitous arrival of smartphones , what matters most is simply that someone , not necessarily a trained professional , was able to take a photograph by the simple fact that he or she was present			0
according to an old press photography saw , when a long - time pro was asked how he made a picture , he replied " f / 8 , and be there , " capturing the essence of what news photography is really about			2
it is the ability to witness , and capture , a moment in time			2
does it always tell the " truth ? " that is a good question , since what we define as truth can sometimes have many meanings			2
if a picture is meant to be the sole , definitive description of what happened , and no one else is around to see , then to a certain degree , we might have to accept its veracity			2
but the ever - increasing presence of cameras , both traditional and camera phones , has added a new dimension to what we see			0
and with the invention and perfection of @entity76 and other photo editing software , it has become much easier to add to , take away from , or alter an image to change its very nature			0
can the camera lie ? not sure			2
can photographers or editors lie ? most assuredly , if they are of a mind to			0
the photograph of president @entity85 taking a " selfie " with the @entity88 and @entity89 prime ministers is a case in point			1
many news organizations and social media platforms jumped on the bandwagon to showcase the photographs where @entity85 is looking away , with what could be considered an angry expression			1
yet those pictures may not necessarily tell the whole story			0
the @entity101 photographer who took the photos wrote a blog describing how surprised he was at the reaction to them			1
and though he released no photos showing the first lady looking more light - hearted , he says , the glum look in the published pictures was simply a moment " captured by chance			1
" a photojournalist covering an event will take dozens , sometimes hundreds , of pictures in the process			0
for large - scale events -- the @entity118 , political conventions -- often the photographer does n't even get to edit his own pictures , that job being handed off to an editor			0
in the digital , @entity124 , connected age , this becomes the efficient way of getting work processed and out into the real world			0
in the end , as viewers , we have to try to sift through not only what we are seeing , but try to understand what we are not seeing			0
the growth of social media and the concept of so - called " citizen - journalists , " has created a real quandary for the older forms of media and news delivery			0
most professional journalists , both photographers and writers , try to adhere to a code of fairness and objectivity			0
in the @entity150 , it 's only in the last generation that politically charged , partisan reporting has started to become the norm			0
it may seem old - fashioned to think that the light of truth is the most important force for good			1
but that is the place where most professional photographers stand			0
when you decide on your message first , and then try to make the reporting adjust to it , you have created a place where truth becomes the first casualty			1
and if you ask it to , the camera -- like the people who use it -- can certainly lie			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			1

@entity172 : people used to believe that photojournalism depicted the truth
a picture is just a moment , he says , not the whole truth . *context* is important
photographer says his shots of president @entity85 and the first lady were *misinterpreted*
@entity172 : pros try to make photos truthful , but photos can lie if they *'re* *misused*
