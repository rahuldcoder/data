a resounding boom over @entity1 , @entity2 , roused residents from their dinner tables tuesday and had them pointing up to the sky			1
with the largest meteor shower of the year around the corner , the heavens seemed to be giving them a sneak preview			1
a whopper of a fireball roared over their heads and exploded , rattling their houses			2
a dash cam captured it on video as it vanished in a bright blaze			1
the spectacular annual geminid meteor shower kicks into high gear thursday night , @entity23 said , and people around the world will be able to enjoy it			1
some of its meteors have already been dashing through @entity30 's atmosphere			2
the agency recorded nine of them tuesday night			1
but the @entity1 meteor did not appear to be one of them , said @entity23 meteor expert @entity36 , who analyzed the flying space rock after two @entity23 cameras in @entity2 recorded it on video			1
traveling at 45,000 mph , it was too slow			2
" a @entity42 moves at 78,000 mph , " he said			1
and the direction it came from was not typical for a meteor from the big shower			1
the @entity2 fireball was just one of the handful of " sporadic background " meteors that whiz through the atmosphere every day			2
but this was a big one , @entity36 confirmed			2
it weighed about 100 pounds and was about 16 inches thick			2
it made quite a bright flash , as it burned up in the atmosphere			0
even with 100 to 120 meteors per hour coming down during its peak on friday and saturday , the @entity42 shower now has a tough act to follow			1
kaboom ! astronomer @entity63 heard the blast but did not bother to look outside			0
" we were eating dinner and heard a good bang that rattled the roof of our house			1
i dismissed it as a sonic boom , " he posted to @entity71			1
he realized it had to be more than that , when a local tv station phoned the scientist , who studies images from the @entity80 , to ask him to explain what had happened			0
frantic eyewitnesses across the state called local news outlets to report what they saw			0
the explosion shook @entity88 's house , too , he told @entity90 affiliate @entity89 , which received a flood of calls and hundreds of posts to its @entity71 page			0
@entity88 went outside to check it out			0
" i see this tremendous , white , bright light in the western sky			0
and it was just ... it was absolutely enormous , i could n't believe it			0
" others took to social media			0
" did y'all see the meteor that flew above @entity1 ? @entity104			1
that was toooo craaaazy ! " @entity1 resident @entity106 posted on @entity107			1
watch @entity42 ! people around the world can share some of the thrill that bedazzled @entity111 until at least monday , @entity23 said			1
the @entity42 meteor shower will be " rich in fire balls			1
" " of all the debris streams @entity30 passes through every year , the @entity42 are by far the most massive , " he said			1
" when we add up the amount of dust in the @entity42 stream , it outweighs other streams by factors of 5 to 500			1
" @entity23 calls it the 900 - pound gorilla of meteor showers			2
most meteor large showers are caused by comets , which are loosely put together with lots of debris in tow that fly into the atmosphere -- but not geminid			2
an asteroid large space rock named @entity134 flings the stardust that makes the sparkling magic			0
of all the named asteroids , it is the one that flies closest to the sun , @entity36 said -- 2.5 times closer than the planet @entity142			0
it 's a bit of a mystery why 3200 @entity145 is flying with so much debris , @entity36 said			0
he thinks perhaps it was produced by a collision eons ago with another asteroid			0
@entity42 contains the name of the constellation @entity151 , which is the direction the meteors will be coming from			1
they can be viewed well starting at 11 p.m. , but @entity36 recommends waiting until an hour before dawn , " if you can stand the cold			0
" that will give the bright moon time to set and allow the heavens to darken			0
do n't use a telescope or binoculars			0
he recommends lying flat on your back in a sleeping bag so you can take in as much of the sky as possible			0
he wo n't be joining you , but will wait until morning to watch video recordings captured by @entity23 's cameras -- for comfort 's sake , he said			2
" i 'm too old to freeze my rear off anymore			0
