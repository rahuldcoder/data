-- i hate @entity3 parties			1
my wife would prefer that i not open this column with that sentence			0
" we 'll never be invited to another one , " she says			0
hmm ... i hate @entity3 parties			1
oh , i love the @entity3			1
i love @entity10 and the @entity11 nearly upsetting the @entity12 in 1980			0
i love @entity14 's walk - into - the - end zone interception of @entity16 in 1984			2
i love @entity17 reversing field and @entity19 running over the @entity20 and @entity21 shocking the @entity22 and @entity23 filling in for @entity24 and @entity25 yanking the monkey off his back			0
opinion : who is @entity31 backing in the @entity3 ? i absolutely , positively love the @entity3			1
back when i was a kid , growing up on the mean streets of @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity3 watching was simple : me , alone , plopped down in front of the television in my den , football tucked beneath my arm , a bowl of pretzels to the side			1
i did n't want to be bothered ; i did n't want to engage			0
i wanted to watch a football game -- in peace			1
but nowadays , @entity3 parties have joined @entity47 dinners and easter egg hunts as requisite @entity50 rituals -- enjoyment be damned			1
if you 're not in a room with a large - screen tv and a bunch of balloons and 40 people complaining about the nacho dip , you 're in the wrong place			2
well , to hell with that			0
nothing ruins the @entity3 like a @entity3 party			1
or , to be more precise , the people attending a @entity3 party			1
not everyone , of course			0
but for every shindig thrown , there 's guaranteed to be at least one dolt who -- like a " terminator " sent back in time -- is programmed to ruin everything			1
the non-fan 's guide to @entity3 parties here 's a quick breakdown : 1			1
the @entity79 - that 's - about - to - @entity80 : four years ago , while watching the @entity82 and @entity12 play one of the great @entity3 in @entity85 history , i had the misfortune of being in the same room as @entity88			1
i 'd once played flag football with @entity88 and was , well , unimpressed			2
a short , stout man in his early 40s , he boasted hands of stone and speed of mud but talked as if he were @entity95			0
when i first spotted him at the @entity3 party i thought , " uh , this ca n't be good			1
@entity88 predicted every play five seconds before the snap -- and was right approximately .00872 % of the time			2
" oh , they 're gon na run @entity103 up the middle here " -- pass			2
" @entity106 needs to throw a long one " -- screen			2
myles did n't just prognosticate			0
he did so in a r - e - a - l - l - y loud voice			0
i wanted to dress @entity88 in a @entity113 jersey and banish him to a bar in @entity115			0
instead , i sat there , listening as this fool behaved like @entity118 on whippets			0
the @entity120 ! - the - @entity121 - on @entity122 : do n't get me started			0
the @entity3 is about football			1
seriously -- it 's about football and two elite teams and runs up the gut and slants and touchdowns and interceptions and field goals			1
it 's not about the @entity133 puppet , @entity134 and @entity135 teaming up for a wacky @entity137 commercial			2
i get it : commercials are sometimes funny and clever			2
but if one more person jabbers on throughout the game , then tells me to " shhhh ... " so he / she can watch the friggin ' @entity144 , i 'm losing it			1
the @entity146 - in - the - @entity147 - still - on @entity122 : inevitably , someone will arrive this sunday wearing a brand new @entity150 jersey while talking about " all the years i 've suffered waiting for this day			2
" " can you name five members of the @entity150 ? " @entity153			0
" i 'm a fan of the @entity157			0
i was born in 1972			0
not only have i gone 40 years without my team appearing in the @entity3 , but i 've had to sit through the likes of @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162			1
in other words -- zip it			0
the @entity165 : i ca n't remember the last time i attended a @entity3 party where someone failed to pass around a sheet of paper with a bunch of boxes , and everyone was guilted into plunking down $ 5			1
then , throughout the game , someone screams out " 14 ! " or " 27 ! " and everyone cheers			0
to this day , i have no remote idea what this means -- only that it irks the living hell out of me			0
the @entity181 : not much really needs to be said -- he drinks 12 beers , eats all the nachos , vomits all the nachos on your shoes while screaming , " @entity188 ! " and is sent home early			1
fortunately , this year should be ok			0
the wife has agreed that we 'll stay home , order a pizza and watch @entity150 - 49ers in the den with our kids			1
as long as no one talks , i 'm golden			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			2

@entity199 says he loves the @entity3 , just hates having to go to a party
he says when he was young , it was him , with football under arm , the tv , and no talking
now a dolt 's always blabbing through game and wanting quiet during commercials , he says
@entity199 says this year he 's staying home with family to watch -- in peace and quiet
