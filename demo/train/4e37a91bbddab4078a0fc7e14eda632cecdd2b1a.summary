editor 's note : @entity2 , @entity3 , a family physician in @entity4 , @entity5 , is president of the @entity6 , which represents more than 93,000 physicians and medical students nationwide			2
he spent 21 years in the @entity9 , including service as a family physician , chief of a @entity14 emergency room during @entity15 and @entity16 , and deputy commander of an @entity9 medical center			0
@entity2 says recruiting more primary care doctors would improve access to quality health care			1
( @entity22 ) -- @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 are right about one thing in their @entity22 commentary titled " we do n't need more doctors			0
" @entity31 's health care system is broken			1
it requires significant reform if patients are to have access to convenient , affordable and -- most importantly -- high - quality care that results in good outcomes			1
but they have missed a central point			0
we need more primary care physicians now and we will need even more in the future as the baby boom generation ages			1
if @entity31 are to see meaningful health care reform , they must have a primary care doctor to whom they can turn for everyday problems : annual physicals and preventive care , diagnosis and treatment for common illness , and diagnosis and treatment of complex , chronic conditions , referral to subspecialists , and coordination of care provided by a team of professionals			1
our current system has a serious and growing shortage of these primary care physicians			1
today , only 30 percent of physicians provide primary care and 70 percent subspecialize in a single organ system or disease			1
we need a system in which patients get the right kind of care at the right time in the right place by the right type of provider			0
they need health services that provide not just convenient hours for minor health problems , but also medical expertise that ensures consistent , ongoing care ; accurate diagnoses of symptoms ; coordination with pharmacists , other specialists and allied health professionals such as physical therapists ; consistent follow - up ; and convenience			2
all at an affordable cost			0
several health reform proposals set forth by president @entity95 and @entity96 would move federal policy in that direction			0
how ? they incorporate convenience , efficiency , continuity of care and access to a system that relies on the patient - centered medical home -- a concept in which physicians coordinate care with a team of health professionals , offer evening and weekend office hours , and use electronic communication with patients and members of the health care team			2
but this concept wo n't be fulfilled unless we have health reform that increases the number of primary care physicians			1
right now , @entity31 has a current and worsening shortage of primary medical care			2
@entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 contend that increasing the number of physicians also leads to " greater intensity of care , but not better health outcomes			0
" but their argument leaves out a major caveat			0
although a greater number of subspecialists does increase the intensity , number and cost of services , research by @entity140 at the @entity141 consistently demonstrates the opposite occurs in communities with more primary care physicians , particularly family physicians			1
@entity146 concludes that an increase of one primary care physician per 10,000 population resulted in a reduction of 34.6 deaths per 100,000 population at the state level			2
@entity154 , professor of health economics at @entity157 , and @entity158 at the @entity159 confirm these findings			0
their research shows that increasing the number of primary care physicians results in a significant increase in the quality of health care and a reduction of cost to patients			1
however , increasing the number of subspecialists was associated with higher costs and poorer quality			0
at issue , then , is not the total number of physicians , but the number of family physicians and their primary care colleagues			2
demographics , an aging population and resulting increased demand for services will require a significant increase in the number of these physicians			0
given the long - term process required to train primary care physicians , we will continue to struggle with a shortage of primary care physicians , and that shortage will affect patients ' access to care			1
family physicians now are working to fill some of those gaps , according to a 2008 survey by the @entity6			0
the survey found 42 percent of respondents offer extended office hours and 29 percent provide open access or same - day scheduling			0
moreover , 36 percent offer web - based health information , 32 percent ( up from 10 percent two years ago ) prescribe medications by e-mail , and 21 percent ( up from 18 percent two years ago ) offer e-mail interactions			0
in short , despite the financial disincentives and other barriers in the current system , family physicians are working to meet patients ' needs for convenience and access			0
they are improving this convenience and access with the help of nurses and nurse practitioners , who are excellent sources of care when patients have a known set of conditions and diagnoses that are amenable to treatment protocols			0
likewise , walk - in clinics can fill the access gap when patients have an acute problem that requires a treatment that can be spelled out by an accepted protocol			0
however , even these clinics rely on an adequate number of primary care physicians			2
most walk - in clinic staff realize that convenience should not trump quality or continuity , and most will refer patients to a primary care physician for follow - up and ongoing care			1
again , without an adequate number of primary care physicians , these patients will have only partial access to the care they need			1
family physicians and other primary care providers are part of the solution , not part of the problem			2
it is important at this critical time of restructuring the health care system to understand clearly what we are trying to accomplish			0
what we are building is a high - quality , accessible health care system that increases patient satisfaction and health care outcomes while we decrease cost and ethnic disparities			1
this is what a primary - care based health system will deliver			1
this is why president @entity95 and @entity96 aim to rebuild the @entity31 health care system around primary care			1
this is why we need more primary care physicians			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dr. @entity2 .			1

dr. @entity2 : @entity31 needs more primary care doctors to expand access
he says studies show primary care doctors improve health - care outcomes
@entity2 : doctors are seeking to make services more easily available
