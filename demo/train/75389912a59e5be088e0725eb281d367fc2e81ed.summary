" but our mission is not over , " he said saturday			0
the @entity6 forces ' movement in recent days from their strongholds in the deserts of northern @entity1 prompted @entity13 to help address what @entity42 called a " serious " and deteriorating situation , even as @entity13 has resisted efforts to get involved in curbing other rebellions in such former colonies as the @entity78			1

@entity100 rebels , who 'd sought independence for decades , took advantage of the power vacuum and seized swaths of land			0
a power struggle then erupted in the north between the @entity100 and local @entity19 - linked radicals , who themselves wound up in control of a large area as the @entity100 retreated			2

" that is why its action is supported by the international community and saluted by all @entity142 countries			0
" though its troops are posted in locations around @entity142 , @entity13 leaders earlier said they would n't send combat troops to @entity1 and that they 'd scale back @entity13 's military interventions on the continent			1
so its decision to get involved in @entity1 , an operation @entity59 said " will last as long as necessary , " underlies the seriousness of @entity13 's concern about the situation there			1
@entity13 hostages have been taken in neighboring @entity204 by @entity205 , and @entity206 appears intent on containing any further militant expansion in the heart of @entity142			1
