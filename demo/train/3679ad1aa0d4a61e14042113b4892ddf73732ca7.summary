-- novelist @entity1 has been heralded by book insiders as " the next @entity3 , " and her debut , " the @entity5 , " compared with " @entity6			1
" but the unassuming 21 - year - old , who recently graduated from @entity9 , would rather you did n't compare her to one of her favorite authors			1
" every writer wants to be as beloved as @entity3 , " @entity1 said			1
" but we do n't need a ' new @entity3 ' because she is still writing and still amazing			1
" the publishing deal is the biggest similarity between the two writers : six figures for seven books with @entity19			0
but @entity1 's adult novel , weaving in elements of fantasy and dystopia , is entirely different from the world of wizards and spells inhabited by @entity6 and his schoolmates			1
in " the @entity5 , " out this week , @entity1 has built a stark world in 2059 @entity29			1
the city is controlled by a security force named @entity32			0
it has caused clairvoyants , like 19 - year - old dreamwalker @entity35 , to work in the criminal underworld because their talents are considered treasonous			1
after being captured , @entity35 wakes up in an even more powerful city controlled by @entity40 , humanoid creatures who kidnap the different kinds of voyants and train them for their army			0
writing the novel between classes and a publishing internship , @entity1 might sound like a tireless overachiever , and she is			1
@entity1 had written two books by age 19 , inked a multi-book deal at 20 and is now published at age 21			1
but her journey was n't an overnight success story			0
writer in the making at 15 years old , @entity1 was a precocious writer , putting down words before and after school for a " romantic sci - fi epic " called " @entity61			1
" " it followed an eighteen year - old female protagonist , who happens upon a wounded but devilishly - attractive alien and goes on a quest with him to find his eight lost companions " @entity1 wrote on her blog			1
she worked on the idea tirelessly , foregoing sleep to write			0
her mother was " beside herself with worry , " she remembered			0
@entity1 hand - delivered her manuscript to agencies all over @entity29 , but only rejection letters returned			1
her passion for the idea died and her evenings held empty spaces			0
she picked up old writing projects and entered short story contests , but nothing could replace the fervor of working on a novel			0
the next step was following her passion for literature at @entity9			0
although @entity1 had submitted " @entity61 " to @entity91 literary agency , only to have it rejected , she ended up interning there when she was 19			1
the girl who loved @entity29 found herself in the city 's junction of @entity96 and @entity97			2
a couple of nearby shops sold tarot cards and crystal balls			0
" i had this daydream about a girl having the same day at work as me in @entity96 , but she happened to be clairvoyant and the idea stuck in my head , " @entity1 said			1
" on my lunch breaks , i would plan out clairvoyant types			0
" by the end of the internship , @entity1 had a new synopsis			1
she could n't stop writing			0
trying to fit a particular genre or audience never entered her mind			0
it became clear that " @entity61 " was a practice novel , where she could identify her strengths and weaknesses			0
now she could turn her gift for story building into a saga			2
" i 'm often daydreaming and it 's because i 've always liked the idea of there being something more than the normal world			1
so i wanted my readers to feel like there is a big world to explore , and i will help them into it			2
" 5 questions for ' night film ' author @entity132 a second chance during the day , @entity1 studied literature , film criticism and @entity137			1
working on " the @entity5 " was " like an extracurricular activity , except more intense and personal			1
" @entity1 showed the work to author @entity140 , also in @entity9			1
@entity140 suggested she send it to an agent , and @entity143 once again entered the picture			0
" i thought it was very well created , " @entity143 said			2
" the books are n't just elaborate stories that have no root in the world			2
that gives it much more authority			0
" @entity19 , like @entity143 , tends to pursue a more literary list , eschewing fantasy novels , but they became immersed in a world they never could have imagined			2
" there was this incredible instant visceral reaction to reading these pages and feeling like we were sucked into this world that 's so real with these characters that jumped off the page and a narrative that just never stopped , " @entity156 , @entity19 's @entity157 editorial director , said			1
" and she is the most down - to - earth person i 've ever met			2
i keep wondering , where did this come from ? how did she do this ? i 'm amazed at how young she is			0
" term papers and novel drafts @entity1 's family did n't even know the book existed until she called to tell them about the deal with @entity19			1
meanwhile , @entity157 editor @entity176 was impressed with the quick edits @entity1 returned in between writing term papers and taking exams			1
even though @entity1 was 19 at the time , the same age as her character , she kept a narrative distance that read older than her years			1
@entity176 was also taken in by @entity1 's skill with creating a futuristic world on the page , especially as a reader who did n't typically subscribe to fantasy			1
" it was fun to be one of the first people to be let into that world , and to be part of figuring out its contours and its rules , " @entity176 said			2
the biggest challenge was withholding some details to guide readers without overwhelming them			0
reviews in @entity200 and @entity201 criticized " the @entity5 " for dumping too many facts on the reader and deploying so many confusing names			1
a @entity206 reviewer agreed but added that @entity1 " writes so well that you stay interested			2
" " even in the first chapter , there is probably too much information thrown at you , " @entity1 admitted			2
" i do take this insane pleasure in world - building			1
i get the world in my head , but i have to make sure everyone else gets it			2
" only to grow " the @entity5 " is n't being marketed as the next young adult must - read , a la " @entity219 , " despite main character @entity35 's youth			1
the expected audience is broad : young to old , men and women , fantasy and non-fantasy readers			0
" we published it the way we know how , as a really special novel , " @entity176 said			0
" the protagonist may start out at 19 , but there are six more books to come			0
@entity1 will mature and her character will , too			2
starting out in the adult market , readers can grow with the protagonist and she , as an author , has more room to explore serious themes			2
" @entity1 is relieved now that @entity240 , one of the main characters , is out in the world			1
the only surviving character from " @entity61 " has been with her for years			0
and soon , @entity240 could come to life on the big screen			0
the @entity246 have secured the film rights to the book			2
@entity1 has consultation rights , which she hopes to explore given her deep interest in film			2
she is already six chapters into the second book , exploring more of @entity254			0
" i think the books will get better and better , " @entity143 said			0
" i think there is no stopping this girl and it 's incredibly important to her , the writing			0
all good writers , they like writing best , it 's when they are the most themselves			0
she 's obsessive , and that 's good			0
" follow @entity267 on @entity268 : @ @entity269			0

@entity1 and @entity3 's similar book deals created a comparison
21 - year - old author has *crafted* an entirely different world in " the @entity5 "
@entity1 feels most *confident* in her skill with world - building
