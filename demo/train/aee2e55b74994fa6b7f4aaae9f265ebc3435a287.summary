-- in 1948 , a new word appeared in the vocabulary of @entity3 , destined to symbolize racial oppression the world over			1
that word was apartheid , used to describe a policy of segregation and discrimination that aimed to keep blacks and whites apart in every sphere of life			1
the @entity15 - dominated @entity14 had won a narrow election victory in 1948 , and used the word apartheid in a policy statement to describe its segregation program			1
the policy divided the @entity3 population into four distinct racial groups -- white , @entity3 , colored and @entity23 -- and a plethora of laws were passed to institutionalize the apartheid system			1
the @entity27 required all @entity3 to register with the government according to their race			1
interracial sex and marriage was prohibited , and each of the racial groups was required to live separately			0
other laws segregated @entity3 in buses , taxis , trains , hotels , restaurants and waiting rooms			1
@entity41 : anti-apartheid icon and father of modern @entity3 the @entity44 also was outlawed , and the government defined membership so broadly it could arrest people indiscriminately , branding them @entity49			1
@entity41 , who has died at age 95 after years of health ailments , was born in 1918 in a @entity3 where segregation of black and white was already on the statutes			1
the son of a tribal chief , he grew up in a rural community in @entity59 where the color of his skin designated him a second - class citizen under law			0
@entity64 had subpar job opportunities in the years following the creation of the @entity68 in 1910 , legislation came into force making it a criminal offense for blacks to break a labor contract , and which restricted them to unskilled or semi-skilled jobs			1
the @entity75 of 1913 separated @entity3 into areas in which either blacks or whites could own land			1
blacks , constituting two - thirds of the population , were restricted to 7.5 % of the land			2
whites , making up one - fifth of the population , were given 92.5 %			0
it took @entity41 a lifetime of struggle , including 27 years of imprisonment , to undo legislation that denied @entity90 basic freedoms enjoyed by the descendants of white @entity94 colonists			0
opinion : what made him great a man who played a major part in transforming apartheid from an election slogan into an adopted practice was @entity103 , a senator in 1948 and prime minister in 1958			1
he was assassinated in 1966 by a colored parliamentary messenger and was succeeded by @entity106 , who as minister of justice had orchestrated the government 's campaign to crush internal resistance			0
several measures were taken in the 1960s to put the theory of apartheid into practice			2
under the provisions of the @entity118 , urban and rural areas in @entity3 were divided into zones in which members of only one racial group could live , and all others had to move out			1
in practice , it was blacks that had to move , often under threat or use of force			1
between 1963 and 1985 , approximately 3.5 million blacks were sent to the homelands , where they added to the already critical problem of overpopulation			2
most of the homelands were economic and political disasters			0
documenting apartheid by the late 1970s , the @entity14 began to believe that reforms should be introduced to appease domestic and international critics			1
in 1978 @entity139 , @entity106 's successor , and his administration applied a mixture of carrots and sticks			0
it repealed bans on interracial sex and marriage , desegregated many hotels , restaurants , buses and trains , and removed the reservation of skilled jobs for whites			0
but the @entity139 reforms stopped short of making any real change in the distribution of power , and black resistance continued			0
in 1983 , @entity139 's government proposed that political power be shared among whites , coloreds and @entity165 , with separate houses of parliament for each racial group			0
this proposal caused angry opposition within the @entity14 and 16 members were expelled			1
but a new constitution came into place in 1984 , with @entity174 as the first state president			0
most blacks strongly condemned the new constitution			2
rather than viewing it as a major step towards reform , they saw it as another step to bolster apartheid			2
government reforms began in mid- 1980s in january 1986 , @entity139 shocked conservatives in the all - white @entity185 with the statement that @entity3 had " outgrown the outdated concept of apartheid			1
" @entity139 suffered a stroke in 1989 and resigned as party leader			0
@entity191 was elected to succeed him for a five - year term			2
the miracle years @entity194 recognized the urgent need to bring the black majority into the political process , and most party moderates agreed with him in principle			0
but he surprised his supporters by announcing , on february 2 , 1990 , the impending release of @entity41 , who walked to freedom nine days later at the age of 71			0
@entity194 continued reforms by rapidly repealing a number of laws first introduced to bolster the apartheid system , and the irreversible progress towards democracy had begun			2
by the end of 1993 , @entity41 , @entity191 and the leaders of 18 other parties endorsed a new interim constitution to take effect immediately after @entity3 's first election of universal suffrage			2
under this constitution all citizens over 18 were enfranchised , the homelands abolished , and the country was divided into nine new provinces			0
on april 27 , 1994 , the first elections open to all @entity3 citizens were held , and @entity41 was subsequently unanimously elected president by the new parliament			1
@entity41 introduced housing , education and economic development initiatives designed to improve the living standards of blacks			0
he established the @entity232 to investigate human rights abuses during apartheid , and in 1996 he oversaw the enactment of a new democratic constitution			0
after a landslide @entity238 victory in 1999 , he handed over the reigns of power to @entity242			0

@entity3 apartheid policy was instituted in 1948
term was first used by the ruling @entity14
blacks were displaced , often by threat or use of force
system was not formally *dismantled* until 1994
