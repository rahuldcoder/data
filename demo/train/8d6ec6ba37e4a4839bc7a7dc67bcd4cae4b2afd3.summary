-- @entity1 ushered in an era of chemical weapons use that lingers , lethally , into the present day			1
indeed , the @entity5 chlorine attacks against @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity10 troops around @entity11 -- site of the war 's most relentless fighting -- in april 1915 presaged a world in which weapons of mass destruction became at least a permanent background anxiety and often a source of intense terror			2
@entity1 , which began nearly 100 years ago , linked science with mass killing and , despite preventative treaties such as the 1900 @entity24 , created a lasting precedent			1
scientific progress now brought new fears as well as hope			2
the other combatant nations responded to their maximum extent , with rapidly developed mixtures of retaliation - in - kind and protective technologies and procedures			0
perhaps 1 million chemical casualties were inflicted , to little overall military advantage			2
although fatalities were eventually kept relatively low , at about 90,000 in total , there was , and remains , deep revulsion at slow , agonizing deaths from tissue damage through blistering of the skin caused by innovations such as mustard gas or drowning through destruction of the lungs			1
opinion : how a century - old war affects you many survivors were left blind or permanently disabled			0
human distress , dread , " gas fright " and their long - term psychiatric consequences are impossible to calculate			0
they may have fatefully helped intensify @entity59 's psychopathology as he lay brooding upon the @entity61 in a military hospital , temporarily blinded by @entity8 mustard gas			1
later , in the @entity65 of 1925 , the world tried to address its @entity67 problem through a collective promise of " no first chemical or bacteriological use , " backed by uncontrolled arsenals , which it was hoped would deter treaty breach by the hideously plausible and familiar threat of retaliation			0
that gamble held precariously in @entity77 but not in hidden , or conveniently overlooked , one - sided campaigns conducted by @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 in remote theaters such as @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			0
continued secret research created still more efficient nerve gases , blatantly employed by @entity91 's forces in the 1980s against @entity92 and @entity93 , without international response			0
however , the international honeymoon period after the @entity96 allowed the negotiation of total , monitored and inspected elimination of all chemical weapons stocks and production facilities under the 1998 @entity102			1
but @entity1 and its aftermath have left discouraging precedents			1
opinion : the mighty women of @entity1 although banned , in the @entity107 , from keeping any chemical weapons , @entity5 secretly maintained formidable capacities			1
its specialists went on to set up joint trials and research facilities in the @entity114 and to pioneer the whole class of nerve agents			0
cheating in arms - control treaties , especially with the assistance of third parties , has remained a lasting political anxiety and an intelligence priority ever since			0
we now also know that during @entity1 , @entity5 agents tried systematically to infect @entity125 livestock with glanders ( a serious bacterial disease , transmissible to humans but mainly affecting horses and mules )			1
this was the insidious , but fortunately not then very successful , birth of covert scientific biological warfare -- which , despite the unverifiable and evidently broken @entity134 of 1971 , now persists as an uneliminable security nightmare			2
so we are all still partially breathing the yellow - green poison cloud that @entity138 laureate @entity137 determinedly developed and the generals of the @entity140 , locked into the first scientific @entity141 , reluctantly authorized			0
( the suicides , apparently through shame and disgust , of both @entity137 's wife , @entity146 , and @entity147 , one of his sons , seem to add further intimate casualties to his innovation			0
) opinion : how @entity1 gave us ' cooties ' @entity137 's weaponization of chlorine for the second @entity156 heralded a period of destructive technological dynamism in which we still live , when , repeatedly , as @entity159 observed : " out of the libraries come the killers			2
mothers stand despondently waiting , hugging their children and searching the sky , looking for the latest inventions of the professors			0
" and today , the news remains bad			2
mothers still scan the sky for incoming chemicals			0
after 1,400 people were killed with highly efficient sarin nerve agent in the rebel - held eastern suburbs of @entity178 in august , the @entity173 government agreed to join the 1998 @entity102 and cooperate in its own chemical disarmament , as an alternative to @entity182 punitive strikes			1
opinion : the ' bionic men ' of @entity1 before completion of that process , reports repeatedly emerged in early 2014 of new attacks using chlorine , which as an industrial chemical used in water purification can not be removed from the country , although employing it against humans is unquestionably forbidden			1
chlorine 's lethality , even against unprotected civilians , may be unimpressively low by modern standards , but it reliably continues to terrify			0
and while @entity5 culpability in the gas attacks in @entity201 100 years ago was clear , the @entity198 is still unable to agree , or even yet formally investigate , which side has been conducting chemical attacks of any kind in the long @entity173 civil war			1
chemical warfare was universally criminalized in september under @entity207 2118			1
but finally eliminating or even punishing the homicidal employment of chemicals in organized violence is a diplomatic as much as a legal , technical or military problem			0
it turns out that some international behavior over chemical killing remains as toxic as in 1915			1
@entity1 : the @entity215 of postcards			2

@entity218 says @entity1 ushered in era of chemical weapons use that lingers today
he says such things as mustard gas brought agony : blindness , disability , often death
treaties have sought to rein them in but are not always successful , as in @entity173 , he says
chemical warfare was universally criminalized , @entity218 says , but behavior remains toxic
