@entity0 -- second - grade teacher @entity2 walks around what 's left of @entity4 , struggling to pick out of its wreckage the things that once made a school			1
" this was the cafeteria			2
" " this is where my desk sat. " " this is my classroom door			1
" " that yellow wall that 's standing , that 's where we were , " said @entity2 , pointing to a squat stack of cinder blocks			1
she , like many teachers at @entity0 's @entity4 , helped keep students safe when a tornado tore through monday , killing at least 24 people			1
incredibly , given the state of the building , everyone at @entity4 survived			1
their actions no doubt saved lives			2
many have called the teachers -- some of whom literally shielded children with their bodies -- heroes			1
but that 's a word the teachers themselves do n't use			1
" it 's just our job , " @entity2 said tuesday			1
opinion : the courage of teachers right before the tornado hit , she hurried students into two bathrooms and a closet			1
there were about eights boys in the boys ' bathroom , including @entity2 's son , and a dozen girls in the girls ' bathroom			1
she and other adults were with three children in the closet			1
" before i shut the doors , because both bathrooms had doors , i said , ' i 'm going to shut these doors , ' and i said , ' i love you			2
' the boys looked at me a little strange			2
( @entity68 ) walked in the girls ' ( bathroom ) and said , ' i love you ' and they all said ' i love you ' back			0
" i just told them to pray , and then that 's what we did the whole time in the closet , just prayed , " said @entity2			1
a cinder block fell on her neck			0
" i just kept saying to the little girl next to me -- ' it 's almost over			1
' and it just was n't over , " she said			0
eventually though , rain started to fall and the sky lightened			0
@entity89 heard voices and so she and others started opening doors and pulling kids out			0
the children were remarkably calm			1
when asked to explain why that was , @entity2 said she thought they felt safe			0
" we did our best to take care of them and make them feel loved and secure			0
people talked about us being brave , but it 's just our job			1
we love these kids like they 're our own			0
" inside a tornado - ravaged school ' it was a miracle ' while @entity89 was hunkered down in the closet , @entity108 , a first - grade teacher , distracted her students with songs and games			1
" i just got all the desks and i told the kids that we were going to play worms , " she told @entity1 's @entity113			1
" i told them to get underneath the desks , and i put them two by two , and i said , ok , we 're going to play our musical instruments , and we 're going to play worms , and we 're going to play as loud as we can			0
" she did n't want the children to know what was going to happen			1
she did n't want them to hear the roar of the storm			0
" i told them to sing as loud as they could and if they got scared , they could scream , " she said			0
" but keep playing , keep playing , keep playing			0
" afterward , @entity108 was sitting outside on a curb with one of her students when his mom walked up			1
she was crying and hugged her son with her whole body , happy to finally have him in her arms			0
@entity139 had first gone to another place looking for him , but he was n't there			0
photographer captures snapshot of courage at school " i 'm doing great , " @entity139 told @entity113			0
" i am happy and pleased as punch with this lady right here because i think that she had an integral part in saving all the kids in her room			0
it was a miracle that kids walked out alive of that building			0
" another grateful parent struggled to find the right words to thank his son 's teacher at @entity4 , @entity163			1
@entity164 , the father of a third grader , was about 100 miles away when the tornado struck his son 's school			1
he drove as fast and he could , ran about a mile and hopped a ride on a couple of trucks			0
" it was the worst day built in to one of the happiest moments of my life , " he said about the moment he spotted his son			0
" when i saw him running down the street with ms. @entity163 , everything was ok for us at that moment			0
" @entity164 said there 's no way to repay her for what she did			2
@entity189 will forever be a part of their family			0
" she is a hero , " he said			0
opinion : we love and fear the @entity197 skies ' his teacher saved his life ' other teachers literally risked both life and limb , shielding students with their bodies			1
@entity206 was impaled by the leg of a desk protecting her children			1
" we crowded the children under desks , and me and a fellow teacher put ourselves in front of the desks that the children were under , " she told @entity1 's @entity210			1
the roof and walls collapsed around them			0
" amazingly , by the grace of god , i kept it together , " she said			1
" i could n't go into hysterics in front of my children , in front of the other students			1
i had to be calm for them			0
" " it 's nothing anybody would n't do , " @entity206 said			2
" these children -- we see their smiles , their tears , every day , in and out , and we love them			2
" another @entity4 teacher , @entity236 , instructed students to move to an inner part of a room where there was a built - in bookcase as the tornado approached			1
they crouched in the fetal position and used books to protect their heads , according to @entity247 's husband			2
among the kids she was watching was their son			0
" she sort of got over my son , got over the other children , just sort of was trying to shield anyone she could , " @entity247 told @entity1			2
" a cinder block wall actually fell on her back , and she kind of lifted herself up , " he said			0
after the storm passed , another teacher came to help the kids get out from under the wall and help @entity236 , too			2
@entity247 suffered a concussion and has a bad sprain on her ankle and lots of bruises , her husband said , but is expected to be ok			0
their son and the other children all survived			1
" his teacher saved his life , " a mother gushed to @entity1 affiliate @entity273			2
" i have no doubt that @entity278 and his teacher , i mean , they lifted a wall off of these kids			2
" survivors tell harrowing stories @entity1 's @entity284 reported from @entity197			2
