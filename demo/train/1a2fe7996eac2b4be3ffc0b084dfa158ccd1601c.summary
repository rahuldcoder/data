back in 1998 , just as @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 were on the verge of owning the front shelves of bookstores everywhere , the @entity0 launched @entity7 in an effort to mold adolescent bookworms			0
monday marked the start of 2013 's @entity7 , but with young adult literature regularly burning up the bestseller lists , it 's clear many young adults do n't need an excuse to seek out the written word : sixteen - to 29 - year - olds are the largest group checking out books from their local libraries , according to a @entity22 survey			1
wizards , vampires and dystopian future worlds did n't always dominate the genre , which hit its last peak of popularity in the 1970s with the success of controversial novels by the likes of @entity32			1
in the years between , young adult has managed to capture the singular passions of the teen audience over a spectrum of subgenres			1
now , as the book industry enjoys a second " golden age of young adult fiction , " according to expert @entity40 , it bears asking why young adult fiction has become so successful			1
the proof just may be in the timeline			0
young adult books that changed our lives the very beginning the roots of young adult go back to when " teenagers " were given their own distinction as a social demographic : @entity58 " @entity57 , " released by @entity59 in 1942 , is considered to be the first book written and published explicitly for teenagers , according to @entity54 , an author and the former president of the @entity0			1
it was a novel largely for girls about first love			0
in its footsteps followed other romances , ands sport novels for boys			0
the term " young adult " was coined by the @entity0 during the 1960s to represent the 12 - 18 age range			1
novels of the time , like @entity74 's " @entity73 , " offered a mature contemporary realism directed at adolescents			2
the focus on culture and serious themes in young adult paved the way for authors to write with more candor about teen issues in the 1970s , @entity40 said			1
the first golden age is associated with the authors who the parents of today 's teens recognize : @entity32 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
the young adult books of the 1970s remain true time capsules of the high school experience and the drama of being misunderstood			1
books like @entity89 's " @entity95 " brought a literary sense to books targeted at teens			2
but once these books devolved into " single - problem novels " -- divorce , drug abuse -- teens grew tired of the formulaic stories			2
the 1980s welcomed in more genre fiction , like horror from @entity107 and the beginning of @entity110 's " @entity111 " series , and adolescent high drama a la " @entity113 , " while the ' 90s were an eclipse for young adult			1
with fewer teenagers around to soak up young adult lit due to low birth rates in the mid- 1970s , books for tweens and middle - schoolers bloomed			1
but a baby boom in 1992 resulted in a renaissance among teen readers and the second golden age beginning in 2000 , @entity40 said			1
@entity110 aims to give adults ' goosebumps ' " when i was a teen in the ' 90s , there were probably three shelves of teen books i wanted to read , " said @entity128 , president of the @entity0			0
" now , i feel like it 's evolved from three shelves to whole hallways of books			0
" the book world began marketing directly to teens for the first time at the turn of the millennium			2
expansive young adult sections appeared in bookstores , targeting and welcoming teens to discover their very own genre			1
@entity147 's well - timed " @entity148 " series exploded the category and inspired a whole generation of fantasy series novelists , @entity40 said			2
the shift led to success for @entity155 's " @entity156 " vampire saga and @entity158 ' futuristic " @entity157			2
" but why did paranormal and dystopian tales connect so well with teens ? " just like adolescence is between childhood and adulthood , paranormal , or other , is between human and supernatural , " said @entity161 , a young adult author , @entity163 and cognitive science scholar			1
" teens are caught between two worlds , childhood and adulthood , and in @entity174 , they can navigate those two worlds and sometimes dualities of other worlds			2
" now , reveling in the continued success of fantasy subgenres and series , young adult fiction is enjoying a sustained boom rather than an afterglow			1
@entity184 : favorite novels challenged nostalgic hallmarks " it 's not surprising that @entity174 is always dealing with transformation , whether it be realistic or supernatural , " author and publisher @entity187 said			0
" it 's the only genre that can always be both			2
it shows teen life in full chaos			0
and that means constant change			0
" @entity187 is also devoted to reissuing classic young adult novels , from the 1930s to the 1980s			1
while young adult spans and mashes up multiple genres , it connects readers to transformation stories best through emotion			1
when @entity209 was helping develop @entity211 's teen imprint , @entity212 , in the late ' 90s , he and his team spoke directly with teens over the course of four years to discover what they wanted in their literature			2
@entity212 launched a line of novels by debut authors with authentic voices in 2001			0
" teens wanted things that were real , that they connected with , " @entity209 said			2
" it does n't have to reflect reality directly			0
they love ' @entity157 ' not because it 's real in that it happens , but the emotions there are real , and it 's very relatable			2
" young adult novelists do n't shy away from tackling the deepest and darkest issues that teens face , from identity struggles and sexual abuse to drug / alcohol use and suicide			1
authors like @entity238 write about the best and worst of adolescence fearlessly and honestly , building a trust within readers , @entity128 said			0
author @entity242 tried to find books she could relate to as a teen , but the " single - problem " novels that resulted in girls dying for their choices frustrated her			0
she wanted to read the " science fiction novels about girls spying on other planets			2
" now @entity242 has written more than 45 young adult books			1
" the whole reason you 're reading is because you want some hope that you 're going to get through whatever you 're going through			0
i know how hard it was as a teenager , and i understood how it felt to be an outsider			0
i want to be able to offer people hope			0
" @entity242 's teen escapism and empowered heriones turning the page because young adult fiction is always changing , anything goes , said @entity266 , web and young adult section editor for @entity269			1
from sci - fi / fantasy , paranormal and dystopian to classic romance , mystery and contemporary favorites , writers can explore any subject , and readers are eager for new worlds			0
contemporary standalones , or non-serial books , have returned to the forefront as a lighter response to dark paranormal and dystopian series , @entity161 said			0
a real opportunity for growth lies in diversity , @entity128 said , although young adult already surpasses children 's fiction in that aspect			1
cart is pleased to see more gay , lesbian and transgender characters in young adult books but admits that there is a multicultural hole , especially for @entity300 teens			1
young author faces great expectations in ' the @entity303 ' @entity242 strives to amp up the empowerment angle for girls			0
as a teen , she always looked for role model heroines , so all of her female characters " kick ass			0
" the genre is also just as open to male readers as it is to females , said @entity315 , a writer for the @entity317 blog			0
" @entity318 can fall in love with the same books			0
" because filling gaps is an area where young adult succeeds , the " new adult " genre has emerged over the past few years ( beginning with @entity326 coining the phrase in 2009 ) , featuring characters in their late teens and early 20s going through the college experience and a second adolescence			1
only time will tell whether it 's a trend or a budding genre , @entity266 said			0
young adult lit has become popular with readers of all ages and has even allowed parents to see what their teens care about through what they 're reading , @entity187 said			1
after all , 55 % of young adult books purchased in 2012 were bought by adults between 18 and 44 years old , according to @entity343			1
" i do n't think people are reading it just to relive their teen moments , " @entity128 said			0
" it 's so interesting to see what happens when there is all of that living , emotion and the heaviness of all that emotion , without the experience			2
it 's such a terrible and beautiful thing to witness			0
