@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was supposed to be a day celebrating @entity1 achievements in education			2
instead , @entity1 's embattled president broke down crying at an official gathering commemorating @entity8			2
in his emotional speech , @entity9 lamented the estimated 10 million @entity1 who are illiterate and repeated an appeal to @entity13 militants to lay down their arms and expressed fear that his son might one day be forced to flee his country			1
" i have pain in my heart , " @entity9 said , his voice breaking and his eyes red with tears			1
" i 'm afraid that my son , my own son will become a refugee one day			2
please , i do n't want my son and your son to be a foreign citizen			2
i want him to grow up here ... i want him to serve his nation , " @entity9 said , addressing an auditorium full of teachers , government ministers , foreign ambassadors and @entity33 gathered to celebrate the event			1
after wiping his face with a handkerchief , @entity9 urged @entity1 to do more to educate their children			1
several bearded men in the audience brushed away tears as the @entity1 leader concluded his speech			2
it 's not clear what prompted the president 's tearful soliloquy			2
but there is no question , @entity1 observers say , that he and at least one close family member are currently facing strains on many fronts			2
" mr. @entity9 is under a lot of pressure right now , " said @entity55 , a former deputy foreign minister who served as a diplomat for several years under president @entity9			1
" the constant drumbeat of negative news about progress in the country and news of problems with his family must be really having an effect on his ability to think clearly , " said @entity59 , a @entity0 - based analyst with the @entity60			1
the growing @entity13 - inspired insurgency claimed another prominent @entity1 government victim tuesday morning when a bomb ripped through the vehicle of the deputy governor of @entity76 on his morning commute to work			0
the blast killed deputy governor @entity80 , his brother , his son , and two civilian bystanders and wounded at least eight people including two bodyguards , said @entity86 , a spokesman for the @entity76 governor			2
in a statement on tuesday , president @entity9 's office condemned the attack , calling it an act of terrorism			1
meanwhile , according to a report this week in the @entity94 , one of the @entity1 president 's brothers , @entity98 , is currently being investigated by federal prosecutors in @entity100 on charges of tax evasion			1
the @entity103 reports the @entity1 - @entity105 businessman is also being wiretapped by the @entity106			0
speaking to @entity2 by telephone from @entity108 on tuesday , @entity98 denied any wrongdoing , calling allegations that he committed extortion and racketeering " absolutely false " and " ridiculous			0
" he also said he was up to date on paying his @entity105 taxes			0
" all tax returns dating back to 1976 have been filed and completed			0
" @entity98 is an @entity105 citizen who splits his time between the @entity105 , @entity108 and @entity1			0
at the time of the overthrow of the @entity13 , nearly nine years ago , @entity98 ran several @entity1 restaurants in the @entity105			0
today , he is the first vice chairman of the @entity1 @entity119 and one of the most powerful businessmen in @entity1			0
@entity9 is also a major shareholder of @entity123 , which is struggling to survive after a series of risky real estate investments in @entity108 helped lead to a run on the bank by investors earlier this month			1
the chairman of @entity123 , @entity130 , is also the chairman of the @entity1 @entity119			0
president @entity9 has faced a drumbeat of criticism from @entity134 governments in recent months , urging the @entity1 government to crack down on corruption			1
until the recent @entity123 crisis , much of the criticism was focused on another @entity9 brother , @entity138			1
he is the chairman of the provincial council in @entity140 and one of the biggest power brokers in southern @entity1			0
in private conversations , @entity134 diplomats often accuse @entity138 of having links to @entity1 's booming opium industry , charges @entity9 routinely denies			1
" it 's not surprising that the @entity105 government has turned its sights on members of the @entity9 family , " said @entity59 of the @entity60			1
" the question is ... is this a pressure tactic that 's being used on the part of the @entity105 diplomatic corps to get a more vigorous response to the corruption question ? " in his phone interview with @entity2 , businessman @entity98 said he had not yet been contacted by @entity105 officials regarding the reported investigations , but vowed to cooperate fully with @entity105 prosecutors if they came calling			0
" i have nothing to hide			0
it should be easy for them to investigate me			0
" the @entity105 attorney 's office in the @entity167 will not confirm or deny to @entity2 whether prosecutors are investigating the @entity1 president 's brother			1
asked about the reported investigation , @entity105 @entity172 spokeswoman @entity171 answered , " we refer you to the @entity176 because we do not comment on legal matters			0
" some @entity1 analysts , however , welcome the development			0
" how long should we tolerate criminal activities and corruption at higher levels and let it go ? " asked @entity55 , the former @entity1 diplomat			0
" the majority of @entity1 voted for mr. @entity9 , not his brother , not his cousin , not his tribe			1
why anyone with the surname of @entity9 should be in a position of power , that is an important question			1

@entity9 says tearfully , " i have pain in my heart "
