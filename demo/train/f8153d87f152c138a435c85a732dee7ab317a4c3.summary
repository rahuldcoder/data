@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 is n't the easiest place for people with disabilities			1
they are often viewed with suspicion , deemed unlucky , untrustworthy , or without value			0
" unfortunately , we associate disability with all manner of negative influences : with witchcraft , with the devil , with bad karma , " explains @entity8 , who formerly headed @entity1 's @entity9 on @entity10			1
" they get relegated to the sidelines			0
the schooling they should get , the support from their families they should get , they do n't , so life is very difficult for them , " he adds			0
lately , however , a number of @entity29 athletes are hoping to use sport to change public perceptions			1
one of the leading spokesmen for @entity1 's physically challenged is @entity33 , one of a handful of @entity1 para-athletes who competed in the @entity37			1
@entity33 had both his legs amputated when he was one - month old			2
today , he is a professional body builder who also owns his own gym			1
" with the gym , i love it when people see me with my disability training able - bodied people , " says @entity33 , who is now training himself for the @entity29 in @entity42			1
he uses his earnings to reinvest in @entity1 's para-sports , an area he admits is under - financed			1
" we do not have a qualified para-powerlifting bench here in @entity1 , so we make do with the ones that able - bodied people use			1
of course , that reduces our input and output			0
" a new game ? another group looking to bring attention to the cause is the @entity62 , @entity1 's skate soccer team made up of polio survivors			1
" the sport is appreciated			2
i would say , in this country , it is admired by so many people , " says @entity66 , the team 's coach			1
skate soccer does n't yet have @entity29 status , though it has garnered some attention in the last couple of years			1
in 2012 , the story of the @entity62 inspired a @entity77 campaign for the documentary @entity78			1
earlier this year , the team was featured in a documentary and advertising campaign by @entity83			2
@entity66 initially formed the team to help get the men off the street			2
" the idea was to get them to stop begging , to improve their lives			0
i was hoping to use soccer as a way to set up business - and income - generating projects for them , " he recalls			0
since then , his vision has expanded somewhat			0
" one of the dreams is to organize an @entity99 , the first ever in the world here in @entity1 , " he admits			2
" we can get a big @entity103 car to bring people here to come and watch , and the world will finally see them exhibiting their talent			0
" the next generation the @entity109 is currently one of the few institutions working to provide economic opportunities to the country 's physically challenged			2
the center is particularly keen to get their members involved in sports , not only for confidence - building , but for the sponsorship opportunities as well			0
" we have so many people with disabilities who have competed on a world stage , and because of that , they are being introduced to heads of state , " says @entity8			0
" they have acquired a livelihood for themselves and for their families that they did not have before			0
" another novel academy , called @entity132 to dream , is also hoping to nurture @entity1 's future para-sportsmen			1
headed by @entity134 and his @entity135 © , @entity136 -- both internationally recognized wheelchair racers -- the academy aims to educate @entity1 's disabled community , and nurture their talent for sport			1
" we work with some very disadvantaged kids in @entity1 , and they come from environments where they do n't actually know what opportunities are out there in the world			2
so when you bring them here , and tell them if you apply yourself you can achieve amazing things in life , they do n't understand , " says @entity134			0
" those who are competing are the new generation			0
they are the people taking over the baton			0

@entity159 lost both his legs as an infant . now , he 's a @entity29 body builder
like other disabled athletes in @entity1 , he is investing in the future of @entity29 sports
the @entity62 are a @entity1 team of ' *football* ' *players* with polio
their coach hopes the sport will achieve @entity29 status
