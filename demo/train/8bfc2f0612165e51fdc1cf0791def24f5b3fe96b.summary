@entity0 -- @entity2 sent a " thanks , but no thanks " letter to the @entity3 for its induction of @entity5 in @entity6 next weekend			1
bad blood between @entity10 and several former band mates from the original 1985 lineup is apparently at the center of his decision			2
the @entity5 lead singer wrote that after being " polite , courteous and open to an amicable solution , " he concluded that the induction ceremony " does n't appear to be somewhere i 'm actually wanted or respected			1
" " of course i realized as things stood , if @entity5 were to be inducted it 'd be somewhat of a complicated or awkward situation , " said @entity10 , who tours with a version of the group that includes none of the original members from 1985			1
@entity10 expressed frustration with what he called " a seemingly endless amount of revisionism and fantasies " from former bandmates " for the sake of self - promotion and business opportunities masking the actual realities			0
" he singled out original drummer @entity36 for giving " interviews filled with reunion lies " five years ago			1
" until every single one of those generating from or originating with the earlier lineups has been brought out in the light , there is n't room to consider a conversation let alone a reunion , " he wrote			0
and do n't even try to induct him into the hall without his approval , he wrote			0
" i strongly request that i not be inducted in absentia and please know that no one is authorized nor may anyone be permitted to accept any induction for me or speak on my behalf , " @entity10 wrote			1
" neither former members , label representatives nor the @entity3 should imply whether directly , indirectly or by omission that i am included in any purported induction of ' @entity5 '			2
" " we are sorry @entity2 will not be able to accept his induction in person , " said @entity58 , a spokeswoman for the @entity3			2
