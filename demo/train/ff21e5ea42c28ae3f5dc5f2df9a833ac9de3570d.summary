was made available to a referee for the first time			0
host side @entity10 beat @entity12 's @entity11 1 - 0 to earn a quarterfinal clash with @entity15 champions @entity14 of @entity16 , but the result will remain a footnote to @entity4 's " revolution "			1
despite resisting calls for the introduction of @entity7 for many years , @entity4 secretary general @entity20 stated that there was " no reason to be against this technology " on the eve of the match			2
the first referee to have access to the system in a competitive game was @entity32 but the @entity33 had no need to call upon @entity36 's magnetic field system in @entity37			1
this is the first of two goal - line systems being trialed at the competition for the continental club champions , in which the title - holders of the host nation ( @entity43 winners @entity10 on this occasion ) also participate			1
@entity10 , who won the @entity5 championship for the first time last month to earn their place in football history , will also take part as the second system is used , with camera - based @entity53 being used for sunday 's tie with the seven - time @entity15 champions			1
" this is a kind of revolution , " @entity20 told @entity4 's website before the match			2
" it is the first time that this kind of technology is coming into football			0
we must ensure that when the ball goes into the goal , the referee must get the information that the ball has gone in			0
" the referee has the final decision			0
the technology wo n't change the speed , value or spirit of the game			0
" it changed little as @entity10 saw off @entity11 , thanks to a stunning strike from @entity79 after 66 minutes , as the @entity12 ' impressive goalkeeper @entity80 was finally beaten			1
however , it has added a further element to the referee 's pre-match ritual with officials now needing to test the system 90 minutes before every match to determine whether the technology is working as expected			2
after @entity4 had seemingly abandoned @entity7 in 2008 after freezing experiments into the practice , and preferring instead to look at using additional referees , the issue was reborn at the @entity92			2
after a @entity95 shot crossed the line but was not given as @entity97 lost to @entity98 in the @entity99 , @entity4 chief @entity93 backtracked on his previous belief that there was no room for goal - line technology in football			1
after a long testing process , the @entity105 ( @entity105 ) voted in july to use @entity7 at the ongoing @entity3 , as well as the @entity107 and @entity108 in @entity109			0
" this is also an important day for us , " @entity20 had said on wednesday			0
" because we will use one of the two systems we are using here in the @entity115 next year			0
" both @entity116 - based @entity53 and @entity98 's @entity36 transmit their findings to devices that can be worn on officials ' wrists .			1

@entity4 uses goal - line technology at @entity3 opener in @entity5
two competing systems are being trialed at the *global* championships
@entity36 , which uses a magnetic field system , and camera - based @entity53 are the systems
on the pitch , @entity10 reach quarterfinals with *defeat* of @entity11
