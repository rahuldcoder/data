forty - six years ago this month , my father joined @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , to share the eucharist and end @entity2 's 1968 fast for farm workers ' rights			1
it took another nine years , but the state of @entity4 would go on to answer @entity2 's call for justice and pass its groundbreaking @entity13			1
that law surged @entity4 forward in the global labor movement , but @entity16 never had a @entity2			1
and so today -- in the state where my father served as senator and where i now live -- our farm workers suffer from the leftover @entity23 laws that @entity4 addressed nearly half a century ago			1
as a resident of @entity25 , i wanted to see the conditions for myself			2
so i drove a few hours north of my home to @entity28 , @entity25 , and visited the largest producer of fois gras east of the @entity30			2
if you think what farms do to the geese is bad , you should see how they treat the farm workers			1
i met a man who worked 12 hours a day , seven days a week for 10 years without a single day off			0
he was paid minimum wage			0
and though he earned it , he could not claim overtime pay -- overtime that would be paid to any deli worker in @entity16			0
if he tried to form a union , he could be fired			0
i walked through one - room shacks that housed entire families and past queues that led to filthy bathrooms -- one toilet for every 20 workers			2
i met women sexually assaulted in the fields by supervisors in return for employment , and children doing backbreaking labor for $ 3.20 an hour			0
the legacy of @entity23 is alive today in @entity25 , resulting in inexcusable conditions for people who plant our vegetables , pick our fruit and milk our cows			2
all this is legal in @entity25 , the remnants of a bargain struck nationally with the @entity68 to exclude minority workers from @entity71 federal fair labor laws			2
the @entity72 , passed by the @entity73 last year and languishing in the @entity74 , is the first step to addressing some of these egregious violations of international human rights @entity25 farm workers still face			1
the bill is far from radical ; it merely extends to farm workers the same labor protections nearly every other industry in @entity83 has enjoyed since the industrial era			1
but it would be revolutionary for the roughly 100,000 men , women , and children who give @entity16 its daily bread			0
the @entity73 has passed the bill several times ; where it stalls is in the @entity74 , a body that has the votes to pass the bill into law , but where special interests have prevented it from coming to the floor for a vote			2
we can not allow partisan politics to condemn @entity25 's farm workers to another year of misery and abuse			1
@entity25 's legislature must bring the @entity72 to a vote in 2014			0
and when it does , i hope the members of our @entity74 will think of that day in 1968 , when in front of a crowd of 6,000 farm workers , @entity104 said : " when your children and grandchildren take their place in @entity83 -- going to high school , and college and taking good jobs at good pay -- when you look at them , you will say , ' i did this			1
i was there at the point of difficulty and danger			0
' " and though you may be old and bent from many years of labor , no man will stand taller than you when you say , ' i marched with @entity2			0
' " all of us still have the opportunity to join the struggle today			1
and if we do , one day when we are old and bent , we will to turn to our children and grandchildren and say , " i was there at the point of difficulty and danger			0
i marched with the @entity133			0

farm workers suffer from laws @entity4 addressed nearly half a century ago
@entity104 : you should see how farm workers are treated
passing new bill is first step to addressing human rights violations
all of us have the opportunity to join the struggle today
