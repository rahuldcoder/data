@entity0 , @entity1 -- turn back time , more than 90 years , to a cold case that wo n't gather dust			1
it 's a classic whodunit , starting with the rape and murder of a 13 - year - old girl and ending in a lynching			1
it was grist for a prosecutor 's political aspirations , a case that was appealed all the way to the country 's highest court and a story hotly debated in the national press			1
at the center of it all was @entity21 , a northern jew who 'd moved to @entity0 to supervise the @entity23 factory			1
when the body of @entity26 , a white child laborer , was found in the basement , law enforcement homed in on @entity21			1
he was tried and convicted , based on what most historians say was the perjured testimony of a black man , and sentenced to death			1
but when the governor commuted his sentence in 1915 , about 25 men abducted @entity21 , 31 , from the state prison and hung him from a tree in @entity38 , @entity1			1
considered one of the most sensational trials of the early 20th century , the @entity39 seemed to press every hot - button issue of the time : @entity44 , black vs. white , @entity21 vs. @entity46 , industrial vs. agrarian			1
in the years since , it has inspired numerous books and films , tv programs , plays , musicals and songs			1
it has fueled legal discussions , spawned a traveling exhibition and driven public forums			2
who murdered @entity26 ? what forces were behind the lynching of @entity21 ? why should we still care ? answers to these questions , or theories , keep coming			1
" @entity21 was not a good ole @entity65 boy			1
he was different and not ashamed of being different , " said @entity67 , whose new documentary , " the people v. @entity21 , " will air monday on @entity69			1
" the test of us as a society is not necessarily how we treat the best among us but how we treat the most questionable			0
" mixed in with ongoing analysis of the @entity82 story are the descendants of those involved , people who learned of their connections differently and carry these legacies forward in unique ways			1
the accused " the story goes that no one in my family talked about it , " said @entity84 , a 62 - year - old great - niece of @entity21			1
@entity21 was the one who handed @entity26 her check when she stopped by the factory on april 26 , 1913 , @entity91			1
the night watchman , @entity92 , would find the body and call police early the next day			0
@entity84 , of @entity95 , @entity96 , was 16 when she first heard about the case			2
her mother sat her down , told her a story about what a man in the @entity65 had been through , said it was based on her uncle and handed over a book : " a @entity105 is @entity106			2
" it turns out @entity84 's mother got the news in her teens , too , when her boyfriend turned to her after seeing " they wo n't forget , " a 1937 @entity114 film			2
" you know that 's about your uncle , " he said			2
she 'd grown up hearing @entity119 died of pneumonia , and after asking family about it , the truth was revealed , followed by the words , " we will never talk about this again , " @entity84 said			0
" i think it was a family embarrassment , " she said			0
" my grandmother [ who died when @entity84 was 1 ] was very close to her brother			0
it can not be easy to tell someone your brother was lynched and why			2
" the first victim @entity136 was 13 when the story hit her			1
she was in a @entity139 classroom , and her name stopped short a teacher taking attendance			0
" @entity26 , you say ? " she recalled the teacher asking , peering up from his list			1
he wanted to know if she was related to a girl with that name who died in 1913			2
confidently , she told him she was n't			0
but the boys on the playground taunted her anyway , telling her she was reincarnated from a dead girl			0
traumatized , she asked her father about her name			0
" he turned whiter than white , " she remembered			2
@entity26 had been her grandfather 's little sister			1
he only wept when asked about her			0
when @entity136 's family moved back to @entity38 , questions about that name never stopped			2
" i went on a campaign , " said @entity158 , 55 , who sought out every article and piece of information she could find			0
" i did that for years and years and years			0
" the consensus of historians is that the @entity21 case was a miscarriage of justice			1
crime scene evidence was destroyed , they say			0
a bloody hand print was not analyzed			0
transcripts from the trial vanished			2
@entity21 's conviction was based largely on the testimony of a janitor , @entity178 , who most came to see as @entity26 's killer			1
he 'd written notes found with the body , but said they were dictated to him			0
the prosecutor , @entity183 , used race in his argument , saying a black man could n't be smart enough to come up with such stories			2
witnesses would come forward to say @entity178 was seen carrying the body and washing out a bloody shirt			0
@entity178 's own attorney , @entity191 , came to believe in @entity21 's innocence , scrawling a note to that effect on his death bed nearly 35 years later			1
@entity178 , who appeared in the press for petty crimes over the years , eventually disappeared			0
@entity183 , the prosecutor , had political aspirations riding on this win			0
" a conviction of just another black guy was n't going to do anything for his career , " said @entity201 , the archivist at the @entity202 in @entity0 who created the traveling exhibit , " seeking justice : the @entity211			1
" two years after @entity21 's lynching , @entity183 was elected governor of @entity1			1
but the story was interpreted differently by @entity158 , who wrote " the murder of @entity216 , " and stands by this conclusion : " @entity21 was guilty as sin			1
he was a sexual pervert			0
" @entity158 often visits her namesake 's grave in @entity38			2
she 's not the only one			2
she says she 's struck by the teddy bears people leave there			2
the governor @entity228 could n't be prouder of her heritage			0
at 81 , she 's the great - niece of the late @entity1 gov. @entity230 , the man who commuted @entity21 's death sentence to a life sentence , believing @entity21 's innocence would be proved and , in doing so , ruined his political career			1
the @entity235 was called out to protect the governor after his decision prompted a rabble - rousing newspaper publisher to call for the lynching of both @entity21 and @entity230			1
@entity21 had been moved to the state prison in @entity241 , @entity1 , where an inmate slashed his throat			1
he survived , but weeks later about two dozen @entity38 men came into the prison , with no resistance from officials , and abducted @entity82 in the dark of night			0
by dawn , he was hanging from a tree in @entity38			0
photographs of his dangling body and the crowds who gathered there adorned souvenir postcards			0
" @entity21 was a @entity21 and a @entity256 at that			1
@entity259 knew that , " said @entity258 , who lives in @entity0			1
she ca n't explain why the story persists to this day			2
but throughout her life she 's witnessed the kindness of the @entity266 community , especially toward her father , who was named for the late governor			1
" the jewish community could never do enough for my father , " said @entity258 , who recalled being in a @entity266 - owned store with her parents in the 1980s			2
" they could have given us the shop			0
" as grateful as they were to @entity230 , @entity21 's lynching left @entity1 's small @entity266 community frightened			1
many left the state ; those who stayed kept a low profile			0
for decades , they only spoke of @entity21 in hushed tones			1
the lynching party the lynching of a white man can hardly be compared to what happened in the black community in the @entity65			1
but this case , the only lynching of a jew on @entity293 soil , was the culmination of a state - sponsored conspiracy , historians say			2
while @entity1 @entity266 remained quiet , so did those who were involved in @entity21 's killing , said @entity298 of @entity299 , @entity300 , who wrote the authoritative book " and the dead shall rise : the murder of @entity26 and the lynching of @entity21			1
" it would be about 80 years before members of the lynching party were publicly , and not just secretly , known			0
" they were not liquored - up yahoos , " said @entity298 , a journalist , editor and @entity0 native who spent 17 years researching his book			1
" these were smart , deliberate people -- from good , prominent families			0
" they included a former governor , a former mayor , a @entity293 senator 's son , a judge , lawyers , a state legislator and business owners			0
one of the 25 or so men was @entity325 , the grandfather - in - law of @entity326 , a @entity1 lawyer and politician who is a former governor himself and will be running again in 2010			0
@entity326 and his wife , @entity328 , never knew @entity325 , who owned a taxi company in @entity38 and likely provided transportation to the prison where @entity21 was held			1
@entity298 broke the news about the family connection to them			0
" @entity328 's parents did n't know			0
it was never mentioned , " @entity326 said			0
" on death beds , people confessed			0
it was just that powerful			0
" @entity326 , who is featured in the new documentary , said it 's important to keep the story alive and learn from it			2
" it 's a terrible blot on our history , " he said			0
" how we keep it from happening again is to never forget			0

@entity26 's murder in 1913 spawned an @entity0 trial that 's still talked about today
@entity21 was convicted , later lynched by mob of *respected* community *leaders*
