they 've got it all : free food , fitness facilities , massage rooms , hair dressers , laundry rooms and on - site doctors			1
are they @entity10 celebrities ? no , they 're @entity12 employees in @entity13 , south of @entity14 , and if you 're an employee here you 're encouraged to spend 20 % of your time on a project of your choosing			1
it 's no surprise @entity12 places fourth on the @entity20 @entity19 to work for ' list			1
first place belongs to @entity23 , the world 's largest privately held software company which offers free on - site medical care for employees and their families , low - cost high quality child care , a fitness center , library , and summer camp for children of employees			1
how could this possibly pay off ? " it pays off spectacularly , " says @entity36 , journalist and co-author of the @entity19 to work for ' list since its beginning in 1998			1
" we keep track of stock market performances of companies on this list , and they are consistently outperforming other companies , " he adds			0
the payoff shows up in increased innovation and productivity , low turnover , low sickness rates , and high employee satisfaction			1
in a world warring for increasingly sparse talent , a strong employer image is also not to be underestimated			0
" it means you can attract and attain some amazing people " , says @entity56 , senior vice president of people operations at @entity12			1
" people who are exceptional and motivated , and who are driven beyond a good job and a paycheck			1
" " employees matter , and the thought that they just ' turn off their lights ' when they come to work is ridiculous " , says @entity64 , vice president of human resources for @entity23			2
" you are not going to succeed unless you have a stable workforce			0
our voluntary turnover is 4 % or less in an average industry of 22 % , and we estimate it is saving the company hundreds of millions in company turnover			0
" the approach is a far cry from the 1900s sweatshops of the @entity78 , what 's changed ? perhaps not as much as you might like to think			2
the companies on this list are " exceptional , " says @entity36			0
" they are not the norm			0
we still have a lot of ground to cover , but 25 years ago it was such a hierarchical business structure and that 's changed a lot			2
" " the realization that there is a relationship between employee welfare and productivity is actually not new , " says @entity89 , author of @entity90			2
" @entity96 tried a workers ' welfare program to deal with high turnover , even paying people $ 5 a day at a time when that was unheard of			0
others have tried similar programs			0
but , we 've come a long way since the backbreaking work of the 1920s			0
workers today are smarter , more skilled , more demanding			2
" research by the @entity111 to @entity112 , co-publisher of the @entity19 annual list , shows us that today 's employees really do want different things - and it is not in their paychecks			1
their work with more than ten million employees worldwide reveals that what people want is : trust in leadership and each other , pride in their work , enjoyment of the people they work with , and fairness and transparency ; all things that companies like @entity12 and @entity23 seem to do well			1
the key to making this approach successful , they say , is a sincere focus on employee wellbeing			0
" a lot of companies think , they can fix just one thing , says @entity64 , who through @entity23 also works with companies globally to help them create better work environments , " they think that if they add a healthcare centre then that will do			0
but it 's a much bigger picture			2
" @entity56 agrees , " the important thing to note is that you do n't need a lot of money to do what @entity12 has done			1
if you give people freedom , they will amaze you			1
" so , how can you begin to reap the benefits of a happy staff ? simple , says @entity36 : " sit down and talk with your employees			0
ask them what they want			0

@entity12 employees in @entity13 get free food , fitness facilities and on - site doctors
such pay - offs show up in increased innovation and productivity
today 's employees want more than a paycheck
if you give employees freedom , they will surprise you
