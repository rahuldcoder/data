" it 's no fun to be stuck in a wheelchair , to have to go to therapy or ( possibly ) die			0
" but she prefers to focus on the stuff she can do , like getting a perfect score on her first world history quiz			0
for the fiery - haired student , simply being back at school is epic			2
less than a year ago , in december 2012 , @entity0 was on life support after several strokes left her paralyzed , blind and largely unaware of her surroundings			1
her family has no doubt the drug that landed her in the hospital was synthetic marijuana			1

@entity0 is far from alone in her scary experience			2
last week , three people in @entity87 may have died after smoking the drug , according to state health officials			1
the @entity87 @entity90 launched an investigation after 75 people were hospitalized in late august after using the substance			1
@entity76 first wrote about @entity0 in february , after learning about her story through @entity95			2
a lot of people were quick to say then that marijuana should be legalized so drugs like these are n't on the market			2

@entity0 's stepfather , who has been in her life since she was born , is not interested in the debate			2
" my focus is trying to get rid of this one bad product and not trying to substitute with anything else , " said @entity75			0
@entity75 and his family started an organization called @entity113 to educate families , as well as teachers and doctors , about the dangers and warning signs of synthetic marijuana use			1

" i 'm trying to get the kids to realize that one bad decision could lead to a lifetime of pain , " @entity75 said			0
" not just for them , but for their loved ones			0
" it 's been a slow recovery			0
after months in the hospital , @entity0 's family had to operate a lift in their home to move @entity0 from the bed or from the chair			1
now @entity0 can stand up and shift herself , so it 's easier for her parents to transfer her on their own , her mother @entity140 said			2

they go out to movies and ice cream here and there , and they even took @entity0 to a @entity169 concert a few weeks ago			0
seeing @entity0 sing along and be a teenager again , along with watching the handicap bus whisk her off to school last week , are signs that @entity0 is feeling more like herself , said her parents			1
and here 's more evidence : during her telephone interview with @entity76 , she sounded just like a typical 17 - year - old girl			1
" our goal is to get @entity0 independent again so she can live on her own one day , " said her mother			0
" having her go back to school has really made us see that this is possible			0
