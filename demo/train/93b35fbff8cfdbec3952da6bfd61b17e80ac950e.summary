it was , the premature obituaries proclaimed , @entity2 for @entity3			1
the indomitable figurehead of women 's tennis had been humiliated and cowed -- turfed out of the @entity7 in the first round by an unheralded and unseeded opponent			1
after an injury - blighted few seasons that saw her sink to 175 in the world rankings , @entity3 had hit one of the biggest troughs in her career			1
given all she had achieved , it would have been easy to throw in the towel -- but even at her lowest ebb , @entity3 's desire to clamber back to the top was insatiable			1
but she needed help and , while still in @entity23 , she found it in the shape of coach @entity25 , with whom she has been linked romantically			1
it was a partnership that was to restore @entity3 as the preeminent female player of her generation , culminating in her most successful season at the age of 32			1
" what surprised me at that point was the motivation she had , " @entity25 told @entity33 's @entity32			1
" she really was prepared to do anything to come back to the top			0
" her motivation was at the highest point , maybe , and it was very surprising for someone who had won so much , with such a career record and at that age			2
" she was struggling a bit at the time because that loss really affected her , but she was motivated to work , so that 's what she did			2
" the results speak for themselves			0
@entity3 has won 16 titles in 16 months , with a record of 95 victories and five defeats since teaming up with @entity25			1
in 2013 she won 11 titles -- including the @entity55 , @entity56 and season - ending @entity57 -- the best return in women 's tennis since @entity61 in 1997			1
such a formidable run , which saw her pocket a cool $ 12.3 million in prize money this season , means she now has 17 grand slam titles to her name			1
only three players in the open era have more			0
but according to @entity25 , it was the humbling she was served in @entity23 that paved the way for this current , imperious streak			1
" it 's a failure , you have to accept it , " he explained			2
" when you have failure you can work to be better , and you realize sometimes it 's good to come back to reality			2
" that 's how i see my role , to help her reduce the chances to lose to the strict minimum			2
" i think the chances of her losing now are much smaller than in the past			0
if you look at the statistics they show it , but maybe we can do better -- and it 's a real goal to do better			2
" that insistence @entity3 can reach even greater heights might make her rivals wince			1
there are very few players in the modern game who can match the sheer power and intensity of @entity3 at her peak			1
though now in her thirties , @entity25 rejects any suggestions she is showing any signs of slowing down , and he thinks she can improve still further			1
" for sure , she 's unique , " he said			2
" i 've worked with hundreds of players and many in the top 50 men and women -- for me , i 've not seen anyone like her			0
" she 's a real champion			2
it 's not about the strokes , it 's about what you have inside -- and she has something really special inside			0
the quality of the game she is able to play at her age shows how much her game has evolved from most of the players			0
" i think she improved in many ways her movement on the court ; she moves much better , she moves longer also , she can play longer rallies , much longer if she needs to			0
" i think she added some shots to her game that she was not using that much before			0
she was n't using them because she was n't mastering them like some other shots she masters like nobody else on tour			0
" i think that 's a key thing -- the more options she gets on tour in her game , the more chances to win she has on the first day of the year against the player who plays the best tennis of her career			1
" if she plays her type of game with more efficiency , like being maybe even more aggressive , adding some volleys , some swing volleys for example , she can give another level , which is maybe a bit frightening , but i think she can			0
" @entity25 's influence has clearly galvanized @entity3 , but he insists it is her desire to take responsibility that makes her so unique			1
whereas others might look in desperation to their coach for help if a match is getting away from them , @entity3 grits her teeth and figures it out for herself			1
" she has this ability to find a solution to win , she refuses to lose and this is something really interesting , " he said			0
" most of the players when they are in trouble , or they are struggling , they are complaining			0
" she should n't think , ' i have to rely on someone ' to find the solution , ' because she has the solution within herself			0
she just has to analyze , think , and dig deep and find			0
" some ( players ) just complain and get angry , or give up -- that 's the case of many players			0
and some others call their coach whenever they get broken : ' oh , i need my coach ! ' " come on , you do n't need your coach every time you 're broken			0
you have to think what you should do and look for a solution , and this is something that @entity3 really has in herself			2
" so , with @entity3 in supreme form , is it conceivable she could smash all records in 2014 and win all four slams -- something not done since @entity190 in 1988 ? " yes , i think everything is possible , " @entity25 says			1
" is it going to be easy ? no , it 's not going to be easy , because in terms of focus it 's something really tough to achieve , and also we have to respect the quality of the other players			0

@entity3 has had a *resurgence* under @entity25 's *guidance*
@entity204 had sunk to 175 in world and lost in 2012 @entity56 first round
but with @entity210 coach 's input @entity3 won final two grand slams last year
@entity213 won 11 titles in 2013 , the best return since @entity61 in 1997
