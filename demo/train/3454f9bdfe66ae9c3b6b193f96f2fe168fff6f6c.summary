-- who would have thought it ? @entity3 just scraping by in a cliffhanger penalty kick shootout			0
but from here on out , where every game means somebody 's going home , there 's a 12th man on the field , a true equalizer -- roaring determination			2
and it nearly snatched victory for @entity17			1
but @entity19 's dream of winning a @entity20 on its own soil has survived			1
it meets @entity23 in the quarterfinals after it sent @entity25 home to join striker @entity27 , whom @entity28 suspended for biting an @entity30 player last week			1
that may have cost @entity25 the game , but at the same time , @entity23 has hit the @entity20 like a whirlwind , and fans are swooning for their stand - out midfielder @entity35			1
he has shot half of @entity23 's total 10 goals in the tournament so far			1
@entity41 fans of @entity43 soccer who left the television on over the weekend instead of waiting for @entity47 's faceoff with @entity48 on tuesday , must certainly have caught footy fever from saturday 's exhilarating matches			2
more to come , in the @entity51 of 16 knockout matches -- see viewing times and channels below			0
also included : a nice treat at bottom			0
here 's what to watch for : 1			2
hangovers they may be epidemic in @entity19 after the celebration parties			1
three factors are at work here : @entity64 it was a saturday night			0
@entity68 , it 's @entity19 during @entity20			1
but @entity19 fans have a lot of time to recover from the party , since @entity19 does n't play again until friday			1
if they win that quarterfinal match against @entity23 , get ready of a repeat of last night			2
in the meantime , fans can take in two games on sunday while vegging in front of the tv			0
offense vs. defense @entity82 vs. @entity83 , noon et sunday , @entity84 and @entity85 the @entity82 players could easily be mistaken for a road repair crew if they wear their hunter - orange jerseys on sunday			1
but the color should be taken seriously as a symbol of how on fire they are			0
they have shot the most goals in group play at this year 's @entity20 -- 10 , topping @entity96 and @entity19 , which had seven each			1
they dominated their group , roundly stomping reigning world champ @entity100 5 - 1 in their first game			0
but offense is n't everything , as @entity83 's team will attest			1
they practically put a brick wall in front of their goal during group play , allowing just one ball to get in			0
they held @entity19 to a 0 - 0 tie			2
all they need to do now is score more			0
@entity115 might just have it in him			0
he 's been quite a goal - getter in the past			2
and @entity82 fans certainly make an impression parading down @entity19 's streets in those bright jerseys			1
feels like the first time @entity125 vs. @entity126 , 4 p.m. et sunday , @entity84 and @entity85 they 've never met before , @entity28 says			0
and at the @entity20 , this is only @entity125 's third appearance , and only @entity126 's second			0
@entity125 has shot twice as many goals so far as @entity126 , while allowing only one and putting away major contenders @entity30 and @entity25			0
sound like @entity126 is the underdog ? @entity28 ranks the team 12th in the world and @entity125 28th			0
line - dance craze @entity23 has not only won each of its games so far , it has also won the hearts of millions of fans			1
the spirit of the team 's play , the scoring surge by @entity35			1
but crowds also love @entity23 's signature celebration group dance			1
if @entity23 continues its winning streak , it may catch on			2
watch for it in a disco near you			0

@entity19 has reason to party after its team *squeaked* past @entity17
offensive *powerhouse* @entity157 face @entity83 's nearly *airtight* defense sunday

everybody loves @entity23 and @entity35
