it turns out our crest is going to be this week , " @entity10 said			2
" so we did it in just over two weeks			0
" floodwaters are forecast to peak at 38 feet sunday afternoon			1
last week , warm weather and rain melted snow south of @entity2 and @entity41 , @entity42 , causing the @entity4 to swell			1

" it 's an inconvenience , but we are grateful that it has worked as well as it has			0
