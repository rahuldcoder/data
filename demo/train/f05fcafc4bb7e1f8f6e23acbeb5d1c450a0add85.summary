-- @entity2 rockers the cars are on the road again , the first time in nearly 25 years			1
their mission ? to bring their brand of quirky , syncopated pop music to a new generation			2
the new album " @entity11 " hits shelves , or your favorite download site , tuesday -- the same day the band begins an 11 - city , coast - to - coast tour			1
so , how does the new model of @entity19 sound ? " i think it sounds like @entity19 in 2011 , " keyboardist @entity20 said of the band that formed in @entity22 in 1976			1
" it sounds like a modern album , yet it sounds like @entity19			1
" it 's hard to argue with @entity20			0
the first two songs -- " @entity28 " and " @entity29 " -- off the new album sound instantly familiar			1
the cars always have been a bouncy combination of understated guitars , layered synthesizers , punchy rhythm section and songwriter @entity36 's often - cryptic lyrics dancing among them			1
the genesis of the project began nearly a year and a half ago			0
" i think about january of last year , i got a call from @entity36 saying , ' what do you think about doing a @entity19 album ? ' i was surprised to say the least , " @entity20 said			1
as lead singer and primary songwriter , @entity36 was key to any cars reunion			1
" i think he sort of had a lot of songs that he had written and was sort of getting a backlog of material , " @entity20 said			0
" i think he was just thinking that a lot of them just might work in the context of a new @entity19 album			1
" @entity36 stayed busy in the interim years , recording six solo projects and producing albums by a variety of artists , including @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			0
the cars were a radio staple in the late 1970s and early 1980s , with hits like " @entity64 , " " drive , " and " @entity65			1
" the band 's eye - catching videos also were a hit in @entity70 's formative years			1
the combination fueled more than 23 million in @entity73 album sales , according to figures tallied by the @entity75			1
the recording sessions were the first for the band since bass player and vocalist @entity79 died from cancer in 2000 , making @entity19 a four - piece band			1
in addition to @entity20 and @entity36 , the other original members are @entity85 on guitar and drummer @entity86			0
" we missed him a lot , " @entity20 said			0
" we were talking about him a lot during the time that we were recording			0
his presence was definitely missed			0
" in @entity79 's absence , @entity20 took over bass duties in the studio			1
the @entity19 enlisted producer @entity95 for the project , who like @entity36 had worked with @entity58 , to get the band motoring again			2
" to have an outside producer helped , " according to @entity20			0
" it was a good way to get us working with each other			0
" the result is 10 new @entity19 songs , half produced by @entity95 and the rest by the band			2
the trick with @entity19 , @entity20 said , is for each member to add their own musical personality to the @entity111 - penned songs			2
" i usually go in with a few sort of things that i want to do or try , " he said			0
" the other inspiration sort of comes from spur of the moment kind of messing with sounds and seeing what fits with the track as it gets created			0
" but will any of their old fans be waiting after a quarter - century hiatus ? " i guess there is that danger , " acknowledged @entity20 , who said he 's up for the challenge of trying " to win over some new ones			2
" the cars also are attempting their comeback in a music industry that has largely imploded since the band 's last album in 1987			1
the companies that market music are mere skeletons of their former selves as the digital age has changed the dynamics			0
" the internet has made it so that a lot of bands are kind of making it on their own through their use of the @entity141 , without a traditional record company , " @entity20 said			0
the new album is being released through @entity151 , a joint venture between @entity153 and @entity154			2
the java chain is also marketing music by @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159			0
" it 's kind of hard for me to know exactly where the cars are going fit into that whole strange new world , " @entity20 added with a chuckle			2
" hopefully there are a lot of people who will be curious to hear what the cars are up to these days			2
