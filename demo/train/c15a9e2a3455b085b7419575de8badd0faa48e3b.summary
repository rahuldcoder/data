-- a tall and beguiling blonde sits alone at the bar of a luxury @entity4 hotel			2
looking across the lobby she seductively eyes a mustached @entity9 man			0
emboldened by her enticing glances he approaches the bar and they begin chatting			0
unbeknown to the man , he has just taken the bait in an elaborate trap that , in a matter of hours , will lead to his death and an international murder mystery			2
their conversation is carefully recorded on camera and watched on a monitor by a team of technical experts a short distance away			0
they carefully assess the movements of their subjects and when the @entity9 man finally moves away from his new female acquaintance one of the observers cries " cut ! " the scene -- loosely based on a true story -- is being played out on the set of a new @entity41 film called " @entity42 , " showcasing the unsolved murder of @entity45 leader @entity44 in a @entity47 hotel room more than two years ago			1
@entity44 , a founding member of @entity45 ' military wing , was found dead on january 20 , 2010			1
police believe he was killed the night before by a team of foreign agents , who after tracking @entity53 's movements from @entity54 into the @entity55 , entered his hotel room , injected with him a muscle relaxant and then suffocated him			1
speaking from the set at an @entity41 resort hotel the film 's writer and director @entity61 says he was immediately intrigued by the cloak - and - dagger case worthy of an @entity66 or @entity67 novel			1
" what really fascinated me about this story was that within 5 minutes one morning the whole world accepted one truth , one story which is probably true or maybe true , " @entity61 remarked			0
that widely accepted story is that a group of more than two dozen disguised @entity41 agents traveling on stolen passports were part of an elaborate plot by the @entity80 spy agency to assassinate @entity53			1
closed circuit cameras in @entity47 hotels and airports infamously captured the last known movements of @entity53 and those of his assassins leading @entity47 police to assert that they were 100 % certain that the @entity80 was behind the plot			1
a number of governments served @entity41 with diplomatic rebukes following the murder claiming passports from their countries had been forged as part of the operation			0
the @entity41 government has until this day denied any responsibility for the murder			0
" i do n't know if @entity41 carried out the assassination ... most of us kind of assume it , " @entity61 says			0
but it was the lack of certainty about the facts of the case that prompted @entity61 to start writing the script			0
" there is the reality that everyone knows or thinks they know from the newspapers , " he explains			0
" i want to tell the story slightly different with the same basis , with the same pictures with the same video camera and with the same type of character , but i did it my way			0
" the film , @entity61 says , does not attempt to recreate the known events in the @entity53 case , but rather offers an alternative storyline to the one he says has become widely accepted			1
@entity61 says he tries to answer some frequently asked questions about the assassination plot : did the assailants want to be seen ? were they not aware of the ubiquity of closed circuit surveillance cameras in @entity47 or did they just not care ? and , did the agents overestimate their own abilities and underestimate the investigative skills of the @entity47 police ? this is not the first time the @entity47 killing has served as grist for @entity41 popular culture			1
just weeks after details of the case started emerging , an @entity41 supermarket chain produced a television advertisement shot entirely on surveillance cameras with shoppers dressed as the agents in @entity47 furtively stalking grocery aisles looking for bargains			1
" we call it an assassination of prices ! " the commercial 's director joked at the time , raising questions about the tastefulness of marketing off a murder			2
@entity159 's assassination is not considered a laughing matter in @entity47 or @entity161 where his family lived , but in @entity41 the widespread belief that the @entity80 was involved in the extra-judicial killing of a man considered to be a terrorist serves as a point of pride for many			1
speaking at a media event for the new film , @entity41 model - turned - actress @entity170 , who plays a femme fatale impersonating a secret agent , underscored the admiration many in the country feel for those working in the @entity80			2
" that 's my secret life dream : i would love to be in the @entity80 -- and actually maybe i am -- who knows ? " @entity170 , who is one of @entity41 's best - known international faces , says she grew up hearing stories about the exploits of @entity80 agents , but she acknowledges the sensitivity of the subject matter and works hard to avoid the politics			2
" i do n't want people to think that i am pro or against because it does n't really matter what i think -- i am just playing a role as an actress in a movie that is based on a very interesting story			0
" an interesting story that is still a mystery			0
despite a global search none of the suspects @entity47 police identified as @entity80 agents has been prosecuted and few are holding their breath for a breakthrough in the case .			1
