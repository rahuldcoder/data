after serving time , rapper @entity0 is now on a more spiritual path			1
the artist , who had a thriving career in the early 2000s as part of the label @entity7 , told @entity10 radio station @entity8 that he 's gone from following a troubled path to seeking @entity12			1
@entity0 , born @entity0 , served roughly two years in jail for tax evasion charges and attempted criminal possession of a weapon			2
after his release in 2013 , the rapper picked up a role in the movie " @entity24 , " and found himself growing interested in @entity21 as he promoted the project at churches			1
" i kind of reconnected with @entity21 by doing the ... movie , " @entity0 told the radio station			1
" i reconnected with @entity21 in a different way			1
i was going to all these different churches , ... ( and they ) were great , but i did n't feel like they were talking to me until i went to @entity30 right here in the city			2
" as he recounts in his new memoir , " @entity34 : the @entity36 and @entity37 of becoming a man , " @entity0 was raised by @entity35			1
when his mother left the faith in his pre-teen years , the rapper says he soured on the religion			2
" the family was n't speaking to my mother , and i saw how much it hurt her , " he recalled to @entity8			0
" i did n't want to have anything to do with the religion at all			0
" but after his release from lockup , he found himself drawn to @entity10 's @entity30			1
" you walk into this church and it 's dark in there and the disco ball is still in there and you see the lights and you 're like ... well this is different , " he said			0
" and then you get in there and you start to look at everybody around you , and they look just like you -- it really gave me the feeling that when they say come as you are , they mean the skater kids in the back with the skateboards , like they just came off the street coming to church			0
it was a different type of crowd			0
" and when the church 's pastor , wearing sneakers , jeans and a t - shirt , began to preach , " i felt like he was talking to me , " @entity0 said			1
the rapper added that he and his wife , @entity84 , were " saved " at @entity30 -- meaning they professed to be @entity81 -- and he 's now trying to figure out how to practice his faith while still being in his profession			1
" i want to make sure i 'm doing the right thing			0
i do n't want people to misconstrue what i 'm doing here , " @entity0 said			2
" i 'm taking baby steps , and i want to get closer to @entity21			2
i feel it 's something you should do in life			0
" since his baptism , @entity0 said that he 's become friends with the church 's pastor , @entity95			1
" i started speaking to @entity95 , ( saying ) , ' i do n't know how to do this and take this , because you know what i do for a living			0
