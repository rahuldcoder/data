-- what do you do with 6,000 tons of space junk traveling at thousands of miles an hour ? harpoon it of course			1
it might sound like a scenario straight off the pages of a science fiction novel but it is a suggested solution to an increasing and potentially costly problem in space -- that of debris littering low earth orbit			2
the harpoon plan is one of a range of options being discussed by scientists at a forum in @entity21 next week , and aimed at finding a way of tackling space debris that threatens commercial operations			1
engineer @entity25 , who is leading the harpoon project for the space technology company @entity27 , explains that if a rogue satellite hits another , not only does it ruin the mission but it creates more debris and propagates the problem			1
this run - away scenario is often called the @entity34 , named after @entity36 's @entity35 who first highlighted the risk			2
" there 's a lot of space debris -- 6,000 tons in orbit -- that could pose a threat , " said @entity25			1
" perhaps unwittingly , the average person relies a lot on space -- gps in their phones , telecoms , tv , weather forecasts -- they are things people expect to have , " he said			0

" @entity27 's plan to tackle defunct satellites is to use an unmanned chase spacecraft to get in range , fire a barbed harpoon into the body of the rogue hardware and then use a smaller propulsion unit attached to a tether to tow it back towards the atmosphere where it will burn up safely on re-entry			1
" because the harpoon we are using is very light and the chase satellite more than a ton , momentum is very tiny ... it 's a small recoil , " said @entity25			2
the harpoon system has been tested in the laboratory in the @entity78 and @entity25 will present findings at the conference on wednesday			0
@entity25 estimates that the system could tackle 10 targets per mission and says simulations show that if five to 10 objects were removed each year then that would " stabilize the debris population			0

so how big is the problem ? @entity25 warns that if space junk is not removed it could mean that low - earth orbit might eventually become unusable			1
according to @entity36 there are about 20,000 pieces of space junk bigger than 10cm ( 3.9 inches ) and its chief scientist for orbital debris @entity102 says most robotic satellite missions are vulnerable to particles as small as 5mm ( 0.2 inches ) -- there are thought to be millions of those in orbit			1
" a 5mm ( 0.2 inches ) particle striking a large solar array is likely to have a very little long - lasting effect , but such an object hitting the main body of a satellite could cause a vital component to fail , " he said			0
" normally , it takes the impact of an object about 10cm ( 3.9 inches ) or larger to cause the satellite to suffer a severe fragmentation in which large numbers of new debris would be created			0
" collision speeds can vary from less than 1km per second ( 2,236mph ) to 16km per second ( 35,790mph )			0
" he explained that ground - based radars are able to track objects of about 10cm ( 3.9 inches ) and sometimes smaller , depending on altitude above the earth , while other sensors can detect particles down to about 5mm ( 0.2 inches ) in low earth orbit			0
" space debris poses real threats to both human space flight and robotic missions			1
however , today those threats are largely handled by spacecraft design and operation techniques , " said @entity102			0
" since the 1980s considerable efforts have been made to curtail the creation of new space debris			1
" the @entity36 scientist said the odds of an operational satellite being disabled by space debris remain quite small , though he points out that two have been lost after being hit by man - made debris -- a @entity147 satellite in 1996 and an @entity149 craft in 2009			1
last month , @entity0 reported that space debris left over from a 2007 @entity152 missile test had collided with a @entity154 satellite , according to a researcher at the @entity156			2
and in 2012 the crew of the space station were ordered into escape capsules as a precaution after a piece of debris passed close by			2
both @entity25 and @entity102 say the focus over the last 30 years has been on mitigation but @entity36 and other space agencies are looking at ways to remove large derelict spacecraft and rocket launch stages from low earth orbit			2
the harpoon is clearly aimed at capturing the larger objects but many other solutions have been proposed , including the use of lasers to nudge space junk out of the way , or using giant nets and space tugs			1
" it 's a very active area , " said @entity25			0
" lots of people are coming up with ideas			0
" more space and science news from @entity0 @entity185			0

scientists are set to meet in @entity21 to discuss ways of tackling space debris
it is estimated that there are 6,000 tons of space junk in @entity195 's orbit
space technology company @entity27 has *devised* a plan to harpoon debris
the debris would then be towed towards @entity195 's atmosphere , where it would burn up
