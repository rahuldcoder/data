@entity0 -- @entity3 security forces are preparing to deport hundreds of @entity5 activists expected to arrive at the country 's main international airport beginning sunday to protest @entity3 's policies in the occupied @entity9			1
" @entity3 police will be implementing measures inside and around @entity15 airport from the weekend in order to deal with the arrival of activists into the country , " @entity3 police spokesman @entity10 told @entity1			1
activists for " @entity21 " one of the @entity5 groups organizing what has been dubbed a " fly - in " event , said some 1500 to 2000 activists mainly from @entity27 , the @entity28 , and @entity29 would board civilian flights for @entity3 in order to make their way to various events in @entity34 and other @entity9 cities			1
organizers say they are trying to draw attention to what they claim are prejudicial @entity3 border policies that force many international visitors coming to @entity42 areas to lie about their destinations			2
" we believe , like prisoners in prisons , we are entitled to receive visitors and @entity42 under @entity3 occupation are also entitled to receive visitors , " said event coordinator @entity45			0
" so we are entitled to get international visitors to come and visit and show solidarity with us to learn about the situation , but @entity3 chooses to prevent these people from coming , " last year organizers staged a similar event and @entity3 authorities detained and deported dozens of activists who entered the country			2
on tuesday @entity3 's public security minister , @entity61 called activists " provocateurs " and told @entity3 news portal @entity64 they would " be dealt with in a determined and quick way , " adding that " if they arrive in @entity3 they will be identified , removed from the plane , their entry into @entity3 will be prevented and they will be moved to a detention facility until they are flown out of @entity3			1
" to that end @entity3 officials have been in touch with airlines and provided them with lists of people who are forbidden from entering the country			0
" usually airlines do n't allow these people to embark , because then they have to cover the expense of the return flight " said @entity3 @entity85 spokesman @entity83			0
" what we did last year is we had a list of number of people who have been banned from entering the country in the past , and others who will be banned now because they have openly declared that they will come here to disturb public order in one way or another , " @entity89 told @entity1 @entity89 said passengers landing who are denied an entrance visa have the right to appeal but could face three days in detention before their hearing			0
@entity45 insists the event is entirely peaceful in nature and suggested that @entity3 authorities were over-reacting			0
" the @entity3 internal security is paranoid and is turning the airport into a military camp			2
they want to arrest the activists and are calling us provocateurs and demonstrators as they always do " @entity45 said			0
" the activists are coming peacefully and will visit the @entity9 and help us build a community school and then they will go home with no problems , @entity3 is creating the problems and not us			1
