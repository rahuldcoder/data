reaction to the massacre of cartoonists and journalists and others standing in the way in the @entity8 office of the satirical magazine @entity9 will fall into two categories			1
one group will urge us to respect religions , to refrain from crossing a certain invisible line that offends			1
they will criticize the magazine , carefully prefacing their condemnation of the victims , the cartoonists and their editors , by saying that nothing justifies murder , but then they will make their point , explaining that their lampooning had simply gone too far , that they had it coming			2
there 's another way to respond			1
it is the way a free society , threatened and intimidated by murderous extremists , reacts when its most fundamental principles are on the line			1
satire , humor , even of the tasteless and offensive variety , must be defended without qualification			2
that is how we must respond			2
the last tweet from the magazine 's account , just a few hours before masked gunmen broke in and killed at least a dozen people , features a cartoon wishing a happy new year " and particularly good health " to the leader of the @entity46 , @entity47			1
that , in today 's world , counts as courage of the highest order			1
at this writing , we have no confirmation of who carried out the attack , but we have experience with these sorts of acts			2
our first modern - day encounter with the threat of murder against artists who " offend " came in 1989 , when @entity64 's @entity63 issued a fatwa ( that 's when we all learned the word ) , a religious decree ordering the assassination of the writer @entity68 over his novel , " @entity70			1
" @entity68 went into hiding			2
bookstores carrying the novel were set ablaze , and the novel 's @entity75 translator was murdered			1
the world 's reaction ranged from blazing outrage to cool , considered empathy for the injured feelings of the attackers			1
after @entity64 's new leader reaffirmed the @entity85 in 2012 and raised the bounty on @entity68 's head , the writer told an interviewer that he could draw a " straight line " from the 1989 threat against him and the 9/11 attacks			1
since then , assaults on freedom of expression have become almost routine , with a trail of death in their wake			2
what is most troubling is the extent to which those assaults have succeeded , by producing pre-emptive self - censorship in democratic societies			1
the most famous of all the controversies came in 2005 , when the @entity105 daily @entity103 published cartoons of the prophet @entity107			2
@entity108 forbids depictions of the prophet			2
@entity105 law , incidentally , does not			0
activists used the cartoons to stir up anti-western anger sparking protests against churches and embassies that left hundreds dead			0
i recall watching at home a tv interview in which the @entity105 editor unexpectedly raised an issue of the paper showing the cartoons , and someone in the studio nearly tackled the camera to the ground , apparently to prevent the images from airing			0
discussions about the need to " respect religions " became popular throughout the @entity134			1
@entity135 even passed a law banning " blasphemy			0
" the @entity135 definition of blasphemy , in case you were wondering , is " publishing or uttering matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters sacred by any religion , thereby intentionally causing outrage among a substantial number of adherents of that religion			0
" clearly , the law itself amounts to blasphemy against free expression			1
most reasonable people do n't advocate insulting any religion			0
but in a free society , people 's feelings get hurt			1
we often cringe at what we hear			0
publications such as @entity9 make us wince on a regular basis			1
their targets are racists , extremists of all religions , and just about anyone that strikes their satirical interest			1
one drawing showed three rolls of toilet paper , labeled the @entity173 , the @entity174 , and the @entity175 , under the headline " in the toilet , all the religions			1
" @entity179 , jews , @entity181 , politicians , businessmen , the innocent and the guilty have all come in for pictorial skewering , frequently in rather vulgar fashion			0
you do n't need to subscribe			0
you do n't need to like it			0
but if you want to live in a world in which ideas flow freely , in which even the most powerful have no immunity from scrutiny , there is no question that the work must be defended			1
satire is only the lowest hanging fruit			0
if the cartoonists are silenced , they will find plenty of other targets that upset their sense of right and wrong			1
@entity9 , and @entity68 , and @entity206 , the @entity208 film director murdered for making a film about @entity108 , offended many people			1
the vast majority responded by moving on , or arguing in favor of their own views , not joining a rampage of murder			0
art , comedy , satire in particular , stand at the forefront of democratic freedoms			0
attacks against them serve as an alarm about threats to other aspects of our lives			0
a few years ago , gunmen in @entity230 attacked the @entity232 cartoonist @entity231			0
they beat him and broke his fingers after he drew a cartoon showing the dictator @entity235 hitching a ride out of town with @entity239 's @entity238 , who just been overthrown			1
@entity240 could not take the joke			0
tyrants and would - be tyrants can not tolerate mockery			2
democracies , free societies , have no choice			2
they must defend it as if their survival depended on it			2
even if the jokes are n't funny			0
even if they create risk			0
that is why it was imperative that the film that upset the @entity260 dictator be shown despite -- no , because of -- the threats			0
when the offices of @entity9 were set ablaze in 2011 , after the paper published its " @entity267 " issue , which they said was " guest edited " by the prophet @entity107 , critics predictably complained that the publishers were asking for it , that it was all their fault			1
" sorry for your loss , @entity274 , " wrote @entity271			0
" do you still think the price you paid for printing and offensive , shameful , and singularly humor - deficient parody ... was so worthwhile			2
" the @entity9 editors certainly did			1
and now they have paid a much greater price			0
the people who would silence cartoonists have more than cartoons in their sights			0
it is n't just the drawings they do n't like			0
if they would kill because of a cartoon , think how much about the rest of their lives they will find worth killing for .			0

@entity295 : some says @entity9 killings a signal to respect religions . that 's wrong lesson
she says if we want a world of free - flowing ideas , we must defend free speech , never bend to terrorists
