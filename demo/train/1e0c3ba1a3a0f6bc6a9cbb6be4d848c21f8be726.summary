whose activities eventually pointed the @entity6 to @entity9 's hiding place in @entity10 , were provided by an @entity4 detainee before he was subjected to @entity6 coercive interrogation , and was based also upon information that was provided by detainees that were held in the custody of foreign governments			1
( the report is silent on the interesting question of whether any of these unnamed foreign governments obtained any of their information by using torture			1
) further critical information about the @entity22 was also provided by conventional intelligence techniques and was not elicited by the interrogations of any of the @entity6 detainees , according to the report			1
even worse for the @entity6 -- which has consistently defended the supposed utility of the interrogation program , including in the hunt for @entity9 -- a number of @entity6 prisoners who were subjected to coercive interrogations consistently provided misleading information designed to wave away @entity6 interrogators from the @entity9 courier who would eventually prove to be the key to finding @entity4 's leader			1
the @entity12 report provides the fullest accounting so far of the exact sequence of intelligence breaks that led the @entity6 to determine that the courier , the @entity22 , was likely to be living with @entity9 in @entity10			1
this reads more like a careful @entity61 detective story than a story about the efficacy of coercive interrogations , which some have characterized as torture			1
the report points out that the courier was in touch with @entity70 , the operational commander of the 9/11 attacks , and that it was @entity72 ( signals intelligence ) from phones and email traffic that made this link first in 2002 , well before any @entity6 detainees made such a connection			2
indeed , in a fascinating footnote , the report makes the case that it was " voice cuts " of the courier that were first collected in 2002 that were matched eight years later to the @entity22 and were " geolocated " to an area of @entity10 in 2010 where he was traveling around			2
this was a crucial lead that helped prompt the @entity6 to examine the mysterious compound in @entity90 , @entity10 , where @entity9 was hiding			1
in 2002 , reports from four different detainees held by foreign governments provided important information about the courier 's age , physical appearance and family , information that was also acquired prior to any information about the courier being obtained from @entity6 detainees			2
detainees held by foreign governments also said that the courier was close to @entity9			1
it was @entity106 , an @entity4 operative captured in @entity107 , who provided the most detailed account of @entity9 's courier and his relationship to @entity9 in january 2004 , before he entered @entity6 custody			1
according to a @entity6 official cited in the report , @entity106 , who was in @entity118 custody , " sang like a tweetie bird			2
he opened up right away and was cooperative from the outset			0
" @entity106 described the courier as @entity9 's " closest assistant " and " one of three individuals likely to be with " @entity4 's leader			1
and he correctly surmised that @entity9 would have minimal security and " likely lived in a house with a family somewhere in @entity10			1
" if there was good intelligence coming from sources that were not in @entity6 custody , the @entity12 report demonstrates that the detainees who were in @entity6 custody and were subjected to coercive interrogations made every effort to hide the significance of @entity9 's courier			1
five of the most senior @entity4 detainees in @entity6 custody , all of whom were subjected to some of the most intensive coercive interrogation techniques , variously said that the courier worked only with low level members of @entity4 ; that he was not a courier for @entity9 ; that he was n't close to @entity4 's leader , and that he was focused only on his family following his marriage in 2002			1
none of this , of course , was true			0
the @entity6 , of course , is not happy about the portrayal of its work in the @entity12 report , and in a rebuttal on its website on tuesday the agency pushed back , saying that detainees " in combination with other streams of intelligence " played a role in finding @entity9			1
in particular the @entity6 cites a detainee , @entity161 , who was coercively interrogated and provided what it terms the first information indicating that the @entity22 was indeed @entity9 's courier , rather than just someone who was an ordinary member of @entity4			1
the @entity6 rebuttal is not , however as persuasive as the very detailed history laid out in the @entity12 report , which is buttressed by copious source notes			1
and , in any event , were interrogations of @entity4 detainees really the key to how @entity9 ultimately was found ? after all , it still took almost a decade after the first identification of the courier to find @entity9			1
indeed , there were a number of key breaks that had little to do with the interrogations of @entity4 detainees , which i discovered in the course of reporting my book " @entity182			0
" a large break , according to @entity184 counterterrorism officials , came in 2007 , when a foreign intelligence service that they wo n't identify told the @entity6 that the @entity22 's real name was @entity21			0
it would still take three more years for the @entity6 to find @entity21 in @entity10 , a country with a population of 180 million			0
this involved painstaking work going through reams of phone conversations to try to locate him through his family and circle of associates			0
in june 2010 , the @entity22 and his brother both made changes in the way they communicated on cell phone , which suddenly opened up the possibility of the " geolocation " of both their phones , according to @entity184 counterterrorism officials			0
finally , sometime in the late summer of 2010 , the @entity22 received a call from an old friend in the @entity211 , a man whom @entity184 intelligence officials were monitoring			0
" we 've missed you			0
where have you been ? " asked the friend			0
" i 'm back with the people i was with before			0
" there was a tense pause in the conversation as the friend mulled over that response			0
likely realizing that the @entity22 was back in @entity9 's inner circle , the caller replied after some hesitation , " may @entity227 facilitate			2
" the @entity6 took this call as a confirmation that the @entity22 was still working with @entity4 , a matter that officials were still not entirely sure about			0
the @entity232 was listening to this exchange and through geolocation technologies was able to zero in on the @entity22 's cell phone in northwestern @entity10			0
but the @entity22 practiced rigorous operational security and was always careful to insert the battery in his phone and turn it on only when he was at least an hour 's drive away from the @entity90 compound where he and @entity9 were living			2
to find out where the @entity22 lived by monitoring his cell phone would only go so far			0
in august 2010 , a @entity10 " asset " working for the @entity6 tracked the @entity22 to the crowded city of @entity247 , where @entity9 had founded @entity4 more than two decades earlier			2
in the years when @entity9 was residing in the @entity90 compound , the @entity22 would regularly transit though @entity247 , as it is the gateway to the @entity10 tribal regions where @entity4 had regrouped in the years after 9/11			2
once the @entity6 asset had identified the @entity22 's distinctive white @entity254 suv with a spare tire on its back in @entity247 , the @entity6 was able to follow him as he drove home to @entity90 , more than two hours ' drive to the east			0
the large compound where the @entity22 finally alighted immediately drew interest at the agency because it did n't have phone or internet service , which implied its owners wanted to stay off the grid			0
soon , some @entity6 officials would come to believe that @entity9 himself was living there			2
they were , of course , right .			0

did coercive interrogation yield evidence pointing to @entity9 ?
@entity273 says the @entity12 torture report finds that other forms of *investigation* were key
coercive interrogation actually *yielded* *incorrect* information , the report says
