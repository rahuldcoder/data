on the subject of @entity2 @entity1 and @entity3 are , to paraphrase @entity5 's famous quip about @entity6 and @entity7 , divided by a common political language			1
we think we share the view that in a political world dominated by mass communications , there is little room for forgiveness about scandals , or other personal failures , or a poor record in office			0
yet on those grounds , @entity2 should have died a political death long ago , rather than coming a very close second in this week 's @entity1 elections			1
foreigners , perhaps , will always remain baffled by @entity2 's success in continuing to attract voters			1
but @entity1 , horrified by him though plenty of them are , tend to be a lot less surprised			1
that is because they think of him in context , rather than in isolation			0
in @entity1 politics , the context is all			2
what this means , and what it meant for @entity2 's remarkable feat in nearly doubling his share of the vote between his opinion poll ratings in november 2012 and the election itself , can be laid out in the following evidently misleading indicators : he makes unbelievable promises			1
in part this is true : one of @entity2 's traits is his willingness to say one thing today and the opposite tomorrow , to attract attention from different groups or on different occasions , totally without shame			1
@entity1 know this , and those who support him tend to see it as an endearing part of his character , part of his desire to entertain and to please			2
but also it is misleading : the key promise he made during the 2013 election campaign was entirely believable -- that he would cut or even abolish a dreaded property tax , known by its @entity1 initials as @entity76			1
his record makes him untrustworthy			0
yes , on overall economic policy			0
he has promised to cut them before , and has delivered on at least some of those promises			0
the promise to cut @entity76 was made in an incredibly artful way , as he wrote to voters saying he would pay them back for the tax from his own pocket , which very few will have believed			0
but that did not matter : it drew attention to the proposal in an eye - catching way , and reinforced the only important point -- that he would cut the tax			0
opinion : @entity1 's election leaves country , and eurozone , on financial high - wire he is irresponsible			1
yes , but so is almost everyone to the cynical @entity1 political mind			2
his plan for how to finance this tax cut had as many holes in it as a sieve , but that did not really matter			0
it would have to be financed by taxes on other people , or cuts in spending on other things			0
fine , said his voters : at least this awful tax will go			0
in offering a relentless focus on that tax , he showed that he was listening to the pain of his voters and taking them seriously , rather than talking down to them like most other parties			2
his trials and sex scandals make him a national shame			0
not really , though at times his behavior has stretched even the @entity1 tolerance			2
but the context is important : plenty of people think the justice system works disastrously badly in @entity1 , so if @entity2 is caught up in it -- like so many others -- then so what ? and his sex scandals are really part of his own marketing plan : he cavorts with scantily clad young women in order to make himself look glamorous , young , entertaining and happy			1
moreover , his antics with women act as a distraction from his other weaknesses , like a kind of tranquillizer for those who might otherwise get angry with him			0
a lot of @entity1 , especially young women , hate him for this			2
but enough either do n't care or are sympathetic enough to him to mean that this does not harm him fatally in political terms			0
his opponents are more statesmanlike and responsible			0
yes , that is true of @entity154 , the caretaker prime minister for the past year who then decided to run in the elections with a centrist list of candidates			0
but it is not particularly true of his big opponents -- including the left - wing @entity160 , which has its own scandals , its own selfish interests and , during the election campaign , its own evidence of the abuse of political power in the case of @entity1 's third - largest ( and oldest ) bank , @entity170 , whose business was allegedly run and distorted in the interests of local @entity160 politicians in that area			1
so the @entity160 ( by its @entity1 initials ) is also viewed as selfish by the public , neutralizing @entity2 's disadvantage on that measure			1
since both the pd leader , @entity181 , and @entity154 are dull , leaden communicators who failed to offer any positive , hopeful message for their voters , the way was opened for @entity2			1
news : @entity1 seeks way out of political chaos only one party in the election really stood for change : the @entity191 of @entity192			1
this meant that @entity2 's old - fashioned , tax - cutting message , geared towards preserving his own political power , had plenty of space in which to operate			1
and although @entity2 did not stand for change , he was at least cheerful , smiling and entertaining			2
politics is now all about personalities , as was shown by the rise of @entity192 , but he and @entity201 are opposites in this regard			0
it is true that the discrediting of traditional political parties , combined with the preeminence of television , has given personalities a huge advantage in @entity1 politics , even if neither the @entity160 nor @entity154 seemed able to grasp this			2
personalities and even personal stories breed attention and loyalty , even if from different groups			0
one of the last @entity1 politicians to understand and exploit this was , unfortunately , @entity220			2
oh , and did i forget to mention that @entity2 owns @entity1 's three main commercial tv channels and its biggest advertising sales agency , and has billions of euros in cash to hand around to supporters and allies ? well , that is n't a misleading indicator			1
but it is a reason , perhaps too obvious to dwell upon , for @entity2 's continuing success at the ripe old age of 76 .			1
