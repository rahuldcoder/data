@entity0 -- @entity2 , an @entity3 detained for more than two years in @entity4 , returned to the @entity5 thursday evening			1
the retired businessman from @entity7 , @entity8 , was released saturday			1
he had been held in @entity4 's notorious @entity9 since may 2008 on suspicion of supporting an anti-regime group			1
@entity2 's lawyer , @entity11 , had been negotiating @entity2 's release since september 2009			1
saturday 's release was the product of three trips to @entity4 , meetings with @entity4 officials in @entity18 and @entity19 , and close to 300 e-mails with @entity4 officials , he said			2
@entity2 , 71 , traveled frequently to @entity4 to visit family and friends without incident , according to @entity11			1
in april 2008 , @entity2 went to @entity25 with his wife			1
before he left , he was asked by an acquaintance in @entity0 named @entity28 to take $ 200 for a friend in @entity25 " who was down on his luck , " @entity11 said			2
@entity0 has a large @entity33 community			2
@entity2 did not know the individual to whom he was asked to deliver the money , @entity11 said			1
he handed it over and two weeks later was detained by @entity4 authorities , after the recipient of the money was arrested on charges of association with an anti-regime group called @entity43			1
@entity11 said @entity28 provided him with information he shared with the @entity4 government that proved that @entity2 was not part of @entity43 , which seeks to restore the monarchy in @entity4			1
the group claimed responsibility for the april 12 , 2008 , bombing of the @entity51 in the city of @entity53			1
" this is the product of fourteen months of nonstop negotiations with the @entity4 government and authorities , " @entity11 said saturday			2
" they finally got to the point where they realized he was used by this organization and he does not pose a threat to them			0
" @entity11 said @entity2 's case has thus far been " suspended , " but that he hopes after working out " some final details " with @entity4 authorities , the case will be dismissed outright			1
although @entity2 continues to maintain his innocence , @entity11 said a condition of his release was that he travel to @entity53 before leaving the country to visit the sight of the mosque bombing and to meet with a survivors ' group			1
@entity2 also agreed to share the story of the circumstances of how he was taken advantage of by @entity43			1
" he is more than happy to that , as he feels aggrieved " by the group , @entity11 said			2
@entity2 's is a rag - to - riches story , his 36 - year - old daughter , @entity81 , told @entity1 in march			1
he brought his family to the @entity5 in 1979 , before the @entity83 , and stayed on in @entity8 to keep his family safe			0
@entity81 said her father taught himself @entity86 , started a video game company in his garage and grew it into a successful corporation , which he handed over to his son when he retired 10 years ago			2
" his life was the @entity5 dream , " @entity81 said			0
" he learned everything the hard way , sacrificed for his children and taught us to be grateful for the good things			0
he is wonderful , honest and generous , the kind of father every daughter would want			2
" the family was silent for more than a year about his arrest , fearful that speaking out would politicize the case in @entity25 and @entity105			0
" it was blind faith , really , " @entity81 said , explaining the silence			0
" not knowing it would take this long , and fear of the system			0
there was never a doubt of his innocence			0
" in september 2009 , with no movement on the case and losing hope he would be released , the family hired @entity11 to contact the @entity121 and initiate a dialogue with the @entity4 government			2
the @entity5 and @entity4 do not have formal relations , and @entity125 serves as the " protecting power " for the @entity5 in @entity25			0
@entity11 , who served as the ambassador - at - large for war crimes under the @entity130 administration and as a prosecutor for the @entity133 tribunal at the @entity134 , said he kept the @entity121 informed about the case , but did not ask for @entity5 intervention out of fear @entity2 would become a political pawn by @entity4 in its standoff with the @entity5 over @entity25 's nuclear program			1
" it was a conscious decision not to engage them in the effort , " he said			0
he added that political upheaval in @entity4 after 2009 's disputed presidential election and the government 's subsequent violent crackdown on demonstrators complicated his efforts			0
other americans remain in prison in @entity4			0
@entity5 hikers @entity152 , @entity152 and @entity152 were detained in @entity4 on july 31 , 2009			0
according to their families , they accidentally strayed across an unmarked border into @entity4 while on a hiking trip in @entity157 's @entity156			0
@entity152 was released last month , while @entity152 and @entity152 are still being held on espionage charges			2
@entity159 , an @entity4 - @entity5 scholar who spent four months in jail in 2007 , was arrested in july after the disputed presidential election and sentenced to 15 years in jail for spying			1
an appeals court later reduced his sentence to five years			0
the @entity5 has no information about @entity167 , a former @entity168 agent who disappeared in @entity4 almost three years ago			0
