-- in june 1212 , some 30,000 people , most of them children , massed in the center of @entity3			0
this mob of @entity6 kids - remembered by historians as @entity8 - was on its way to @entity11 to liberate it from an infidel who , it was rumored , ate children			1
eight hundred years later , the connected children in today 's @entity18 world have it much easier			1
today , in what we might dub the @entity8 2.0 , tens of millions of innocent kids have found a new @entity11 to liberate			1
it 's called @entity24 and their liberation vehicle is the " @entity27 " viral video commodifying innocence that has been watched 80 million times since its release last week			1
this time though , the kids do n't even need to leave home to go on their crusade			2
all it takes is a click of a mouse and $ 15 to liberate the world from an infidel who catches , disfigures and eats children			1
and this time , they might even get a bracelet and an " action kit " to memorialize their participation in this struggle against almighty evil			0
yes , @entity24 -- and specifically @entity47 -- has been reduced to a meme			0
an online meme spread like a rash by hyper - connected kids on global networks like @entity18 , @entity53 and @entity54			0
it 's no coincidence that " @entity27 , " part " @entity57 " and part " @entity58 , " begins with the video of a birth			2
our @entity18 world changes everything , the movie promises its audience of children			1
we are told that " the game has new rules			0
" the world has been turned upside down by social media , the eschatological video explains , and now " a bunch of littles can make difference			2
" " we can change the course of human history , " " @entity27 " promises its audience of littles			2
we can do that , it promises , by creating a network of millions of kids who will catch @entity84 , the @entity47 warlord described by @entity85 , the deliciously blonde , four - year - old star of the movie , as a " big bad guy			1
" " @entity84 abducts kids just like @entity85 , " the movie 's narrator , @entity88 -- who just happens to be @entity85 's dad --- tells us			1
@entity84 forces kids to kill their own parents and mutilate people 's faces			1
he is the personification of evil , the antichrist of @entity6 eschatology , the sort of monster who , 800 years ago , inspired 30,000 kids to leave home and set sail to @entity11			1
" @entity27 " may be in poor taste , but it 's rich in irony			2
and it 's particularly ironic that the most viral @entity53 video of all time was made by a non-profit group called " @entity112 "			0
children are many things these days , but they certainly are n't invisible -- especially on the @entity115 , where it is the kids , these adolescent messengers , who are becoming the @entity120 message of our networked age			2
the glossily seductive " @entity27 " was explicitly designed for kids			1
in defense of his movie , @entity88 said on @entity0 that he thinks of " @entity27 " as being owned by children because " the youth of the world " has funded it			1
invisible children 's ceo , @entity129 , even acknowledged to the @entity131 that the movie was made to appeal to children			2
" how do we make this translate to a 14 - year - old who has just walked out of algebra class ? " @entity129 said of @entity112 's thinking behind the movie			2
and the kids of the world , those millions of innocent 14 - year - olds who walked from their algebra class to the nearest screen , have repaid invisible children by turning " @entity27 " into one of the most viral products in history			1
yes , outraged celebrities like @entity150 and @entity151 , who unselfishly showed off her breasts for @entity112 , helped spread the word			0
but it 's the children who have transformed the big mustachioed @entity84 from a has - been @entity47 warlord into the second - coming of @entity157 ( whose little mustachioed face is , of course , also featured in the video )			1
even the most informed bloggers on the @entity115 , like @entity163 's @entity162 , a-list blogger @entity164 and @entity166 's @entity165 all discovered " @entity27 " through their kids			1
" i am watching https://twitter.com / ' my 11 yr old : ' oh i 've seen that : i 've already emailed it to my grade '			0
this is the new news cycle , " @entity165 , who heads up @entity166 's @entity171 for @entity172 , tweeted last week			0
in a way then , all the messianic promise of " @entity27 " is eerily prescient			0
the world has been turned on its head and the game does , indeed , have new rules			0
in our radically democratic age , it 's the kids rather than the grown - ups who are curating the news , identifying the bad guys , perhaps even architecting the moral thrust of @entity190 foreign policy			0
writing in the @entity192 at the weekend , the cultural critic @entity191 observed : " in the past decade that we appear to have entered an aura - free universe in which all eras coexist at once -- a state of possibly permanent atemporality given to us courtesy of the @entity115			0
no particular era now dominates			0
we live in a post-era era without forms of its own powerful enough to brand the times			0
but in what he calls " our new world of flattened time and space , " i wonder if we are also seeing , alongside the radical democratization of time and space , the flattening of age			0
in a post-era era world of " @entity27 , " with its harrypotterfication of reality and its transformation of @entity24 from a complex , infinitely nuanced society into a manichaean @entity216 fantasy of good and evil , are we all now becoming teenagers ? i hope not			1
800 years ago , back in 1212 , the @entity8 ended in shipwreck and enslavement			0
today 's digital version of that innocent crusade , led by the pied - pipers from @entity112 , probably wo n't end so tragically			0
but should we really be empowering children to make moral decisions about a world in which they have little experience ? should we entrust the innocent , that " bunch of littles " who have made " @entity27 " such an instant hit , to architect our brave new connected world ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241			1

@entity241 : tens of millions of innocent kids have found a new @entity11 to liberate
@entity241 : all it takes to join the crusade is a click of a mouse and $ 15
millions have watched the " @entity27 " movie *spotlighting* the *horrors* of @entity84
@entity241 : should we trust children to make moral decisions with *minimal* world experience ?
