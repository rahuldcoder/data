in " @entity4 , " wealthy @entity1 citizens of all races and ethnicities come together to watch the 74th annual bloodbath of the same name			2
it seems some present - day moviegoers , however , are a bit less " post-racial			2
" earlier this week , some " @entity11 " fans tweeted their discontent because the characters of @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 are played by black actors in the big screen adaptation			1
this , despite the fact that both @entity15 ( @entity20 ) and @entity16 ( @entity21 ) are described as having " dark skin " in @entity24 ' novel , while @entity14 ( @entity25 ) is simply described as having short brown hair			1
whether fans ' remarks -- such as , " awkward moment when @entity16 is some black girl and not the little innocent blonde girl you picture " -- stem from poor reading comprehension or intolerance , they 're indicative of a larger issue in @entity34 , said @entity37 , an associate professor of radio , tv and film at the @entity40 who co-wrote " @entity42 on film : representing @entity44			1
" " @entity34 has never been on the forefront of the civil rights movement , " said @entity37 , who has n't read or watched " @entity4			2
" despite certain character descriptions being spelled out in the book , @entity37 said , people typically project themselves onto a character in order to empathize with that person			2
" for a white person reading a book , they 're very rarely going to go , ' i 'm just assuming this is a black character ' if he or she is n't marked as such , " he said			1
" a nonwhite person might project their own identity onto the character			2
" skin color is a recurring but understated motif of the novels			1
many @entity1 residents , for instance , dye their skin to make a statement of affluence , taking on exotic hues like green , gold and olive			1
the way @entity34 sees it , the more people who identify with a character , the more tickets a movie might sell , he added , referencing @entity84 's may 2010 @entity83 campaign for the chance to audition for @entity86			0
( the role eventually went to @entity89 actor @entity88 )			0
" put @entity84 as @entity86 , ( and the movie ) will only make $ 80 million rather than $ 100 million , " @entity37 said			0
" if it 's @entity93 or @entity88 , it 's a @entity86 movie			0
with @entity84 , it 's a black superhero movie			1
" in june 2010 , @entity97 - @entity42 blogs lit up when @entity99 's name was proposed for the lead role in the upcoming " @entity101 : a life			0
" the book 's author agreed that the actress would be a good fit in the role as the @entity109 queen			0
an @entity112 post stated : " honestly , i do n't care how full @entity99 's lips are , how many @entity97 children she adopts , or how bronzed her skin will become for the film , i firmly believe this role should have gone to a black woman			1
" and there are plenty more instances of white actors snagging minority roles : fans were disappointed when @entity122 was cast as the @entity123 , and the lack of @entity126 actors cast in @entity128 's " @entity127 " prompted some people to boycott the film			1
usually fans are angry when a film adaptation strays too far from a novel , said casting director @entity132			1
in " @entity4 " " they 're being true to the source material , so i do n't see what the issue is , " he said			0
having cast film adaptations of popular books like " @entity139 " and " @entity140 , " @entity132 added , " it 's impossible to be slavish to the way characters are described in a novel because those characters exist in the readers ' mind in a purely subjective way			1
... it 's often ... a self - referential image			0
" @entity132 recently worked on @entity151 's " @entity150 , " in which @entity152 and @entity153 play @entity154 and @entity155 , respectively			0
he said casting historical and political figures , who are known to the audience , is different from putting a face to a character from a novel			2
" [ @entity152 and @entity153 ' performances ] are not impersonations , and certainly not caricatures , " @entity132 said			0
" they are evocative of those people and they have their own integrity			0
but they 're close enough to make people feel like they 're watching the real thing			0
" even so , @entity152 said she underwent quite the physical transformation to play @entity154 , spending two hours in makeup before shooting			0
similarly , @entity173 and @entity174 both changed their hair color for " @entity4			0
" " as a casting director , " @entity132 said , " i 'm concerned about the quality of performance much more than hair color , and if an audience leaves a film overly concerned about the color of a character 's hair , something might be missing from the storytelling			1
" as far as the backlash over casting black actors in " @entity4 , " he said " i like to think @entity34 studios would take the high road on this issue , and remain true to the story regardless of what a segment of the population might object			1

some " @entity11 " fans are *displeased* that @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 are played by black actors
both @entity15 and @entity16 are described as having " dark skin " in @entity24 ' novel
casting director : usually , fans are angry when a film adaptation strays from the novel
