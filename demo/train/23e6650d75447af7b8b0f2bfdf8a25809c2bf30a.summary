@entity0 , @entity1 -- encouraged by results so far , @entity3 and the government agreed saturday to another 24 hours of testing of the recently recapped @entity7 well			1
@entity3 's 48 - hour window for pressure testing expired saturday afternoon with no reports of flowing oil or evidence that the giant sealing cap caused further damage			1
the testing will now go into sunday afternoon			2
retired adm. @entity16 , the government 's response manager , said once testing is eventually stopped " we will immediately return to containment , using the new , tighter sealing cap with both the [ vessels ] @entity23 and the @entity24			2
" pressure was still rising saturday though it had slowed considerably as expected , @entity3 senior vice president @entity25 said earlier in the day			1
officials are looking at the testing in six - hour windows			2
" the longer the test goes the more confidence we have in it , " @entity25 told reporters in a conference call saturday			0
" there 's no evidence we do n't have integrity			0
" higher pressure means oil is not leaking out from another source in the well			1
lower pressure would indicate otherwise			2
a @entity44 and @entity45 sonar ship has been brought in to monitor the sea floor around the well , @entity16 said in a statement			0
" the pressure in the capping stack continues to increase very slowly and we want to continue to monitor this progress			1
" the latest pressure reading inside the well was 6,745 psi ( pounds per square inch ) , @entity25 said			2
that falls short of the optimal 8,000 to 9,000 psi needed in order to conclude without doubt the well is not leaking			0
" based on the data and pressure readings compiled to date , the test has provided us with valuable information which will inform the procedure to kill the well and a better understanding of options for temporary shut - in during a hurricane , " @entity16 said			1
@entity16 said friday that the rising pressure readings were generally good news			1
but he added , " i think we 're at a point where there 's enough uncertainty about the meaning of the pressure that we 're seeing that we have to use due diligence moving forward			2
we do n't want to do harm or create a situation that can not be reversed			0
" reopening the valves would allow oil to once again flow into the @entity7 and recovery operations from the surface to resume			1
no oil has gushed out since thursday when @entity3 closed all the valves in a new custom - made cap that was lowered into place earlier in the week			1
the undersea video images of a quiet ocean sprouted new hope in the hearts of @entity91 residents devastated by three months of disaster			1
still , they remained cautiously optimistic , as did officials including @entity16 and president @entity95 , until @entity3 is able to announce conclusive test results			1
engineers and scientists intensified monitoring of the well , pouring over images and data collected by robots , sonar scans and seismic and acoustic examinations			1
a government ship is in the area , fitted with equipment for detecting methane gas , which would be an indication of a leak			0
the well integrity test began thursday after two days of delays , first as government scientists scrutinized testing procedures and then as @entity3 replaced a leaking piece of equipment known as a choke line			1
the oil stopped gushing out thursday afternoon , the first time the energy giant has been able to gain control since the @entity123 drilling rig exploded april 20 and triggered the catastrophe			1
all that was made possible by a new , tightly fitting containment cap			0
meanwhile , @entity3 restarted work on drilling two relief wells			2
@entity25 said saturday that the first relief well is now about five feet away from the ruptured @entity130 well and an intersection will occur by the end of july			0
@entity3 then plans to pump mud and cement down to kill the ruptured well			2
" we are feeling very good at this point on how the well is lining up , " @entity25 said			0
when they are ready , mud and cement will be pumped into one of the relief wells to permanently seal @entity3 's crippled well			2
in the coming weeks , @entity3 also plans to bring in two more oil collection ships in addition to the two already in the @entity7 , bringing containment capacity to 80,000 barrels ( about 3.4 million gallons ) of oil a day , more than high - end estimates of how much oil had been leaking			1
but it 's possible some oil may be released into the @entity7 again , before all the ships are ready			1
the skimming vessel " a whale , " which underwent extensive testing , was found unsuited for the task and will not be deployed , adm. @entity150 said			0
president @entity95 spoke about the developments with a note of caution			0
" i think it 's important that we do n't get ahead of ourselves here , " he said			0
" you know , one of the problems with having this camera down there is that when the oil stops gushing , everybody feels like we 're done , and we 're not			0
we wo n't be done until we actually know that we killed the well and have a permanent solution in place			0
" the president expects to return to the @entity91 in the next few weeks			0
he took some heat from some corners on saturday for taking a vacation in @entity175 instead of heading to revisit oil - affected areas			0
first lady @entity177 is slated to return to the region friday to meet with @entity180 personnel who 've been responding to the oil spill and to christen a coast guard cutter named in honor of @entity184 , the service branch 's first female commissioned officer .			0

new : @entity187 , @entity3 encouraged by well pressure testing
testing will continue ; pressure is still rising , though slowly
scientists are pouring through undersea images and data
no oil has gushed into the @entity7 since thursday
