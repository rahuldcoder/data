at 33 years old , @entity0 is trying to get clean			1
the native bostonian started at a young age : drinking , then smoking pot , then taking pain pills and eventually heroin			1
" i never thought in my wildest dreams i would stick a needle in my arm , " said @entity0 , who did n't want his last name revealed			1
" not in a million years			1
" but the low cost , the readily availability and the prescription pill - like high makes heroin a draw that 's hard to resist			1
" it 's a monkey on your back that you ca n't shake , " he says			1
if autopsy results bear out what officials suspect , actor @entity19 will be the latest in a growing list of substance abusers who paid a deadly price for using heroin			1
in july , heroin ( mixed with alcohol ) took the life of " @entity32 " star @entity31			1
in august , @entity33 , a 16 - year - old @entity34 high school student who 'd never injected heroin before , died when a friend shot it into a vein for her			1
and last week , @entity40 officials said that heroin tainted with fentanyl had claimed at least 37 lives since september			2
another 22 cases were reported in @entity45 and other towns in western @entity47			2
to be sure , heroin has been a scourge for a long , long time			2
but lately , it 's showing an uptick that has authorities , health officials and parents disturbed			1
" @entity58 is pummeling the @entity59 , leaving addiction , overdoses and fear in its wake , " said @entity55 of the @entity57 's @entity56			1
a 2012 survey by the federal @entity65 ( @entity66 ) found that about 669,000 people over age 12 had used heroin at some point in the year			2
about 156,000 of those were first - time users , and roughly 467,000 were considered heroin - dependent -- more than double the number in 2002			1
" i 've been here over six years , and literally this is the first year that i can remember seeing this many people coming in here with an addiction to heroin , " said @entity75 , director of the @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78			1
it 's not at an epidemic level yet , he says , but " it 's going to be there			1
... it 's that bad			1
" heroin remains comparatively rare , according to administration figures			2
by comparison , more than 31 million people used marijuana or hashish in 2012 alone , and another 4.7 million used some form of cocaine that year			2
but about 4.6 million people -- about 1.8 % of the teenage and adult population -- reported using heroin at some point in their lives , the survey found			2
the average first - time user was 23			2
here , we examine the reasons behind the rise in heroin use and its fatal draw : it 's cheap			1
@entity110 was hooked on @entity111 , a prescription pain reliever			2
he did n't just like it ; he loved it			2
the problem was , he could n't afford it			2
" i was pawning things : stealing from my parents , my sister , everyone who cared about me , " he said			2
" even that was n't enough			2
" so he moved on to heroin			2
it gave him the same high , he said , but at a fraction of the cost			2
" i started out snorting , " he said			0
" and , of course , to conserve my money , i moved on to shooting it			0
" the bottom line for users : heroin is cheap			1
part of the reason is the nationwide crackdown on prescription pill abuse , which has made those drugs harder and more expensive to obtain			0
in the first two weeks of 2014 , police in @entity77 , @entity78 , say , they seized more heroin than they did in the past 10 years combined			0
" people were getting pills for $ 10 around here , and now it 's much more expensive , " said @entity142 sgt. @entity141			1
" people are now turning to heroin to get their high			0
" and how cheap is heroin ? " we 've heard for as low as $ 6 a capsule , " she said			0
@entity155 is a self - described addict who does n't want his last name revealed			0
his drug of choice is oxycodone			0
but he knows that when he ca n't get it , he can always score some heroin			0
" it 's literally five minutes down the road , " he said			1
" @entity164 of @entity165 lost her college - age son to a heroin overdose			0
" in the college campuses what they are doing with it , is like they are just passing bowls of pills , " she said			0
" they give it out for free to get somebody hooked			0
and then they start with a lower price on the pills and jack it up , jack it up as they are more addicted			0
" indeed , heroin availability rose in 2012 , according to the @entity57 , most likely because of an uptick in @entity187 production and traffickers expanding into new markets			0
authorities are doing what they can to put a dent in those activities , but they have a ways to go			0
between 2008 and 2012 , the amount of heroin seized each year at the southwest border more than tripled			0
but pushers are getting creative			0
last month , police said they arrested a @entity201 's employee in @entity45 for selling heroin in happy meal boxes			1
heroin makes for a common substitute for prescription pills			0
but unlike pills , there 's no way to regulate the dosage of heroin , given the undetermined purity			1
and that can be a fatal recipe			0
" unlike with prescription drugs , heroin purity and dosage amounts vary , and heroin is often cut with other substances , all of which could cause inexperienced abusers to accidentally overdose , " the @entity57 says in its drug threat assessment report for 2013			0
between 1999 and 2009 , 32 states saw an increase in heroin - related patients , according to the @entity228			0
but rather than acting as a deterrent , the drug 's undetermined potency actually serves as a draw for some users			1
last month , at least 22 people in western @entity47 died after using heroin that had been mixed with fentanyl , a powerful narcotic used to treat cancer patients ' pain			0
the drug cocktails were being sold under harmless sounding names , such as " @entity242 " and " @entity243			0
" @entity244 , a 19 - year - old @entity245 who did n't want his last name revealed , overdosed on the drug mixture twice and almost died			0
but he kept going back			1
it took his friend 's overdose death to scare him back into rehab			1
" that 's the sick thing about addiction , " he said			1
" when someone knows that there are heroin bags that are killing people or making them overdose , then we know that those are the good bags			0
" it 's hard to kick			1
last year , @entity19 told @entity263 he strugged with substance abuse but kicked the habit for 23 years			1
but then he fell off the wagon			0
he started slowly with prescription pills and slipped into snorting cocaine			0
that experience is not uncommon			0
" someone with opiate addiction , they are doing pushups their whole lives , " said @entity271 's dr. @entity270			1
" and they must work on it all the time			0
and even working on it , there 's a high probability of relapse			1
and @entity283 willing , they get adequate treatment , and they re-engage in treatment , and things go well			0
" " but often , " he added , " it 's a frequently fatal condition			1

" it 's a monkey on your back , " says a man trying to kick the habit
@entity19 is the latest in a growing list of deaths
the number of users is rising , and they are getting younger
it 's *threatening* to become an epidemic , says a rehab director
