-- @entity1 does n't like to be shoehorned as an artist			1
even in his early days , he refused to paint the usual " traditional " watercolors of @entity5 horizons and indigenous animal kingdom that attract tourists			0
instead , he followed his own artistic path and today is one of @entity11 's most revered abstract artists			1
the 40 - year - old dreamer has become a champion of the artistic landscape in @entity11 , but has also founded @entity15 , an artistic collective that connects painters and prospective clients			1
@entity0 sat down with the passionate artist and entrepreneur to discuss his roots and how he is inspiring enthusiastic creatives in his homeland			1
@entity0 : so how did you take that first step into the art world ? @entity27 : i decided at the age of 28 to try my luck with a gallerist who was in the vicinity			1
i presented my works to him and he said : ' no , @entity1 , i do n't think this will sell in this gallery ... most of the artists , they paint about the @entity40 , @entity11 , they paint about our highest mountain , they paint about our wildlife , because this is what the tourists want to take back when they are going home			1
' and i said , we could try something different			0
and that 's what we did			1
three days later he calls me and says that your work is gone			0
so that 's how it began , i never looked back			1
@entity0 : but you continued working as a loan officer until you were 31			1
was there a moment when you finally said : ' i want to be an artist ? ' @entity27 : my break came one day			2
it was early morning in a toilet when this idea fell on my lap -- to create an art company that would work as a hub for artists			1
a company that would act as a link between artists and the corporate world			2
i had the business experience and the land was virgin			0
there were no art managers on the land and so i felt it would be good to work in that niche			2
my contract was coming to an end and i was being offered a new contract that would take me to another city			0
i declined and chose to take my own direction			0
@entity0 : how would you describe your artistic style ? @entity27 : i am very contemporary , and versatile			2
i am not a conformist			0
i am able to move from one medium to another			0
i am a painter , i am a sculptor , i am a fashion designer , i am a graphic designer , i am a writer , i am a poet , i am a filmmaker			0
i am a conceptual artist , am an abstract expressionist			1
i do n't want to be identified with one form of art style			2
@entity0 : are there any particular themes you like to showcase ? @entity27 : as a visual artist , my past has had a strong bearing on me			2
growing up in a big family equaled to lack of resources			0
the levels of want were quite disturbing , much more especially as i was approaching my teens			0
suddenly i discovered that we were poorer than some families			0
i could not have or eat what i wanted			0
those stories of poverty , of want , of freedom , of wanting to survive , have always been part of my subjects			0
i 'm interested in stories of fellow @entity5 before me who had much harder life			2
these stories inspire me to create art. i want to create a podium for discussions , in the process hoping to change mindsets and make life better for our future generations			2
@entity0 : who are your artistic heroes ? @entity27 : i think i 've been inspired by all these great artists			1
i 've been inspired by @entity128 , looking at his work			0
i 've been inspired by @entity130 , i 've looked at the work of @entity132 , quite beautiful			0
@entity133 , wonderful , and even the young @entity135 artists of the 90 's			1
if you look at @entity137 , i 've seen works by @entity139 , and it 's all had a bearing on me as an artist			1
@entity0 : so what is the @entity145 art scene like ? @entity27 : i discovered that most of the artists were poorly managed			1
there were no managers in the arts sector			0
there is no art school in the country			1
so what was normally happening is they had the skill , they had this great talent amongst the artist , but they did n't know how to organize themselves			2
@entity0 : so you founded @entity15 and then a few years later you opened a kids studio ... @entity27 : we do n't have formal art schools and i thought well , this could be a very good avenue for the kids to come in and just prepare them			1
i think the most important thing in @entity11 is the art education			0
it does n't necessarily mean that whoever enters an art class will be an artist			1
but they will make a good audience , or make a good client , because they know the kind of strenuous process artists go through to create whatever they are going to create			0
if we have the art education in our systems , then we have a community that would appreciate the arts			0
learn more about @entity1 's @entity15 and find out what the versatile creative is moving on to next			1
