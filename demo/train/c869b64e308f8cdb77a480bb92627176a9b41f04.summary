scientists have long predicted that @entity1 had significant volcanic activity in the first billion years of its history , but images of the planet 's surface have n't delivered as much evidence of volcanoes as they expected			1
new research suggests , however , that scientists may have been looking for the wrong kind of volcanoes			1
a new study in the journal @entity15 argues that a handful of geological formations on @entity1 that were thought of as impact craters were once , instead , supervolcanoes			1
they never looked like mountains ; rather , they formed when the ground collapsed on itself in violent explosions			0
" this is a totally new kind of process that we had n't thought about for @entity1 , and it changes the way we view the evolution of the planet , " said lead study author @entity25 of the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 , and the @entity29 in @entity30			1
the volcanic eruptions likely represented the biggest explosions in the history of @entity1 , @entity25 said			1
these explosions would have occurred more than 3.5 billion years ago			1
he and @entity44 colleague @entity43 focused on a region on @entity1 called @entity46 , which is speckled with craters			1
@entity43 could not discuss the study wednesday , @entity25 said , because of the @entity50 government shutdown that furloughed most of @entity44 's employees			2
( but @entity1 rover operations , including driving and using scientific instruments , are continuing this week , a @entity44 spokesman said )			2
@entity44 on shutdown : ' sort it out , humans ' the researchers used data from instruments aboard several orbiters : @entity60 , the @entity61 , the @entity62 and @entity63			0
particularly intriguing to them was a crater called @entity66 , which did not have features consistent with an impact crater			1
instead , it resembled a structure seen on @entity71 called a caldera , which is a volcano that has collapsed inward ( caldera is also the @entity76 word for cauldron			2
) they believe @entity66 is the best example of a possible ancient supervolcano on @entity1			1
when you think of a volcano , a cone - shaped structure protruding from the ground probably comes to mind			0
these , such as @entity86 in @entity87 , are essentially mountains of lava			0
but @entity66 and other supervolcanoes on @entity1 never looked like that ; instead , they represent the inward collapse of @entity1 terrain			1
@entity66 and other supervolcanoes would have been much smaller than @entity96 , a shield volcano on @entity1 about the size of the state of @entity28 , and the biggest volcano in the solar system			1
but while @entity96 oozed lava , the supervolcano explosions would have been much more powerful , @entity25 said -- they would have thrown material all around the planet			0
by comparison , @entity105 erupted on @entity71 in 1980 , spewing more than 0.24 cubic miles ( 1 cubic kilometer ) of material over @entity98 and surrounding areas			0
@entity110 can produce eruptions spouting more than 1,000 times more volcanic material than that			2
six must - see volcanoes on @entity71 how a supervolcano collapses how calderas such as @entity66 form is similar to the process that created what is today @entity120 , @entity25 said			1
a supervolcano there exploded 640,000 years ago ; there was no mountain - like structure there beforehand			1
had you been there , said @entity25 , you would have been standing around in @entity129 and observing a bit of steam coming out of the ground			0
you would start to feel earthquakes because of the movement of magma underneath you , causing the earth to crack and break			0
bigger and bigger earthquakes would have given way to smaller explosions from within the ground			0
that happens because as the magma produces bubbles , pressure would build up and blows up the terrain ; destabilization would lead to more earthquakes and then -- boom ! -- a massive explosion			0
such explosions would send ash far into the atmosphere , creating lots of heat and gas			0
the wind would carry away the ash , and while much of it would rain down to form layered materials on @entity71 , some ash would stay in the atmosphere for years to come " by the time you 'd get to see that , you 'll be dead , because it 's quite a massive , violent activity , " @entity25 said			2
" no one 's really ever witnessed it , because if you did , you would n't be here to tell about it			0
" @entity168 discovered in @entity1 soil why it matters supervolcanoes were instrumental in shaping geological formations and the climate on our own planet , and the same goes for @entity1 , @entity25 said			2
eruptions would have sent the climate into a tailspin of global cooling or warming , or both , because of competing environmental processes , he said			0
the volcanic explosions emitted greenhouse gas and unleashed ash into the atmosphere , which blocks out the sun. " that would have had a strong impact on what the climate and what the environment was like at geologically relevant time scales , " he said			0
understanding supervolcanoes could give scientists new clues into the early @entity1 atmosphere and explain various features of the planet 's geology			1
material from the eruptions may even be responsible for some of the rocks that the @entity1 rover curiosity has been encountering since it landed on august 6 , 2012			2
@entity1 may be home to even more ancient supervolcanoes that today look like impact craters , researchers say			1
@entity210 , planetology researcher at the @entity212 , who was not involved in the study , believes some of the conclusions of this new study are speculative and not based on a firm timescale			0
more research is needed to better determine whether this supervolcano activity really predates other significant volcanic episodes , specifically , those that occurred in the @entity221 region of @entity1 , she said			1
" one thing lacking in this study is the constraint on the timing of these events , to fully evaluate the impact on atmosphere evolution and impact on climate , " she said in an e-mail			2
" nonetheless , events related to the formation of these landforms can have significant influence and may be important if no other activity occurred at the same time			0
" more orbital data would help resolve unanswered questions about the ancient supervolcanoes , @entity25 said			0
like magma under an active fault , such discussions will continue bubbling among members of the community of scientists who study @entity1			1

study : @entity110 on @entity1 exploded more than 3.5 billion years ago
scientists say some structures that look like impact craters were volcanoes instead
the best example is called @entity66
more research needs to be done to *confirm*
