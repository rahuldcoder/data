-- before president @entity4 's endorsement of same - sex marriage this week , @entity2 officials gave mixed signals on just how and when the president had originally planned to roll out his support for the issue			1
some said an announcement had been in the works for a while and was imminent , while others said that the president intended to reveal his beliefs during a previously scheduled appearance on " @entity18 " this monday			2
others said the president was going to speak out for same - sex marriage at some point before the @entity23 convention			2
the @entity23 sources said that the president knew he had to voice his support before the convention when the @entity23 is likely to include a pro-same - sex marriage plank in its platform			2
and whatever timeline he had was moved up after @entity31 spoke candidly in favor of same - sex marriage during a television interview taped last friday for @entity35 's " @entity34			1
" during the interview , @entity31 said he was " absolutely comfortable " with same - sex marriage , stronger language than the president had used on the matter			1
@entity2 press advisors were made aware of @entity31 's comments after the taping and , according to sources in the media , quickly began preemptive damage control , ahead of the interview 's broadcast on sunday			1
despite the effort , @entity31 's comments dominated the political news cycle on sunday and gained further traction monday after education secretary @entity52 said he also supported same - sex marriage in an @entity53 interview that morning			1
@entity2 press secretary @entity54 was also peppered with questions on the issue during monday 's @entity2 press briefing			1
a number of marriage equality advocates quickly seized on the comments , using them as a rallying cry to urge the president to take a firmer stance			2
many of the groups even pointed to high - profile @entity67 who have voiced support , including former vice president @entity70 and former first lady @entity71			2
some @entity2 insiders told @entity0 that @entity4 had not originally intended to announce his thoughts on same - sex marriage on " @entity18 , " but some advisers thought it would be the best venue			1
others felt that the situation needed to be addressed before then			0
so on tuesday @entity80 's @entity79 was invited to come to the @entity2 for an interview , which was conducted on wednesday			1
@entity80 cut into programming around 3 p.m. et wednesday , alerting viewers that @entity4 had officially expressed support for members of the same gender to legally wed. " i 've just concluded that for me , personally , it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same - sex couples should be able to get married , " @entity4 said in the interview			0
the response was instant and dramatic , as @entity90 lit up with reactions of celebration and dismay , while political figures flooded reporters ' in - boxes with statements			0
everyone seemed to have something to say			0
supporters hailed the president 's decision , with many describing it as a historic moment for the movement			2
opponents , however , were quick to disagree with his opinion , though some credited @entity4 for making his position clear			0
the @entity2 sent talking points to key supporters and surrogates , emphasizing that this was a personal decision the president came to after discussions with his wife and kids , and later reached out to faith leaders			1
the president 's re-election campaign was already promoting and fundraising off his comments by thursday morning			1
multiple top @entity23 said senior @entity4 aides were deeply annoyed with @entity31 for forcing the conversation on same - sex marriage earlier than planned			2
these officials said @entity31 had , in the past , advised the president against coming out in favor of same - sex marriage because of the potential political downsides , making it all the more frustrating , multiple sources said			1
all of the sources emphasize , however , the episode will not create a lasting rift between the @entity134 and the vice president 's office , as @entity31 has gone off script before and will do it again , they said			1
in his " @entity34 " interview , @entity31 mentioned the former @entity35 comedy " @entity138 " as a major catalyst in what he described as a changing , more accepting @entity143 culture			1
the show 's creator , @entity145 , said wednesday on @entity148 's " @entity147 " that @entity31 had used similar language at a private fundraiser three weeks prior to the interview			1
he added that the @entity2 was recording @entity31 while he made the comments at the event			1
" this says to me that it was all very choreographed , " @entity145 said			0
" it just does n't seem right to me because it was verbatim to what he had said three weeks earlier ...			0
he was testing the material out of town , and then he took it to a larger house , which was ' meet the press			0
' " @entity2 officials told @entity0 that it 's standard practice to record every event the president and vice president attend as a record , whether they 're public or private events			1
two people who attended the event dispute @entity175 's characterization and say the vice president gave them no reason to believe the president or the @entity2 was going to reveal a change of position on gay marriage			1
late thursday , two senior administration officials told @entity31 apologized wednesday to the president for putting him in a tough position			2
president @entity4 responded by saying that he knows the vice president was speaking from the heart			0
@entity23 sources added they were not concerned @entity31 will " get credit " for the president 's announcement			1
they say they think most @entity143 already believed the president was probably in favor of gay marriage			0
one source added that @entity4 has a close personal relationship with @entity31 , one that trumps his advisers ' frustrations			2
as evidence that the vice president is not in the doghouse -- he has a campaign swing to the critical battleground state of @entity205 next week			0
but , the source said , there is a great deal of interest in keeping the vice president " on script			0
" @entity4 , who once opposed same - sex marriage , had recently taken the official position that his views were " evolving			0
" he hinted , however , that he was edging toward embracing same sex marriage , saying at fundraisers there was more work to be done for same - sex couples , leading supporters to believe he would take a clearer position			0
1996 document showed @entity4 favored same - sex marriage based on past statements some @entity4 supporters have believed the president long supported same - sex marriage but kept his beliefs private because of the potential political risks			0
however , top @entity4 aides insist the president only completed his " evolution " on this issue several months ago			0
after that , it was just a question of when he 'd speak out and share his views			0
@entity0 's @entity235 contributed to this report .			0
