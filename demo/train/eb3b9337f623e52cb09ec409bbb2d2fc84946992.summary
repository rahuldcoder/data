@entity0 , @entity1 -- birthdays are always a good time for reflection			0
my 20s were mostly fun times , hanging out and risk - taking professionally			0
my 30s were about really focusing on the career and traveling to places i finally had some money to afford			0
now , one year into my 40s , i 'm blessed with home ownership and the realization that i am officially a " grown - up			0
" the childish mistakes that you could laugh off in your 20s and consider a growing experience in your 30s should now be gone by 40			0
when you 're dating after 40 , the reaction you get from family and friends on your birthday is also totally different			1
i decided to have my latest birthday party at my new house			1
it was a nice gathering of family and friends , including the man that i have been dating for a couple of months			1
for some of my family and friends , it was the first time they were seeing my newly purchased home			1
i was excited to show folks my proud accomplishment of home ownership			0
each group that i showed around the house -- regardless of age or gender -- had the same question when they saw the two spare bedrooms			1
" so , what do you plan to do with these bedrooms ? " i pondered the question each time , realizing i could n't say i 'd use it as an office since i had one set up downstairs			2
my answers varied from " how about a guest room " to " possibly a home gym " to " i really do n't know			0
" their reaction each and every time was exactly the same : " how about some kids ? " my first response was " with whom ? " -- seriously , i am not married -- then i realized they were referring to my new beau			2
i started stammering and was slightly embarrassed , especially when he was in my presence for some of these questions			2
it seems folks get really comfortable with certain questions after you pass that important milestone of 40			2
i gave all the right answers : that buying a house made more sense than a townhouse in this market , i realized the amount of equity i could get buying in this neighborhood and of course the first - time home buyer credit was too much to pass up			1
no one seemed interested in those answers , so the conversation quickly changed to something else			0
after all , if i were in my 20s or 30s and dating , the house likely would have been viewed by most as a great investment			2
also , it 's not to say that these questions about marriage did n't occur in those earlier years			1
but somehow in your 40s , a choice had to be made			2
society does seem to put an enormous amount of pressure on women once they hit the later years of childbearing age			0
assumptions are made that every personal decision is a reflection of your desire to have , or not have , children			1
so , needless to say , my friends and family saw my house as a symbol of my last - ditch effort to claim a white picket fenced yard filled with kids			1
these were all questions that i never expected to confront at a casual birthday barbecue			1
the questions -- but more importantly my reaction -- made me consider the possibility that i did subconsciously purchase this house hoping that i would fill those bedrooms with kids instead of workout equipment			1
was i , in fact , laying the groundwork for the future i hoped to have -- of marriage , children and a dog ? at the closing attorney 's office the day i bought the house , i remember being more interested in the incredible investment i just made			1
after all the birthday party guests had left , i asked my beau if the questions about children made him feel uncomfortable			1
he smartly answered " no " and seemed surprised that i never expected that question to come up			0
i quickly pointed out to him that if the roles were reversed , i did n't think that people would make that assumption with a man			2
so , i might have another barbecue for the @entity141			0
just to make things interesting and confuse folks , i might just rent a dog and watch the assumptions begin			0
