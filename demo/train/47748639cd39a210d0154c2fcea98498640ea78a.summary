-- does the singer come first ? or the songwriter ? let 's start with the songs : " @entity5			1
" just the catalogue alone would qualify him for any number of musical halls of fame -- and , indeed , @entity10 is in the @entity15 , the @entity16 and the @entity17			1
he has a @entity18 from the @entity19 , the first it ever presented			2
they decided to name it for him			2
then there 's the voice , that baritone as smooth as fine whiskey , capable of jaunty sing - alongs , angry despair , pensive melancholy			2
amazingly , his delivery was once considered too unusual for @entity31 , with a start - stop phrasing that skipped around the beat			2
now it 's as welcome as his other voice , the well - worn @entity37 - 20 acoustic guitar he calls " trigger			2
" add to that @entity10 the man			1
he 's the man who co-created @entity40 , the annual festival that has raised more than $ 43 million to help farm families			1
( that got him into the @entity44			0
) he started @entity45 , which makes fuel out of soy and vegetable oils			0
he has a street named for him in @entity50 , @entity51 , his home since the early 1970s			0
he 's still at it , raising money for the victims of the @entity55 , @entity51 , explosion			0
@entity57 is not far from @entity58 , where @entity10 was born			1
ok , @entity10 is n't without flaw			1
he 's been busted for marijuana on more than one occasion			0
he has n't always been faithful to his wives ; his first one famously tied a passed - out @entity10 in a bedsheet and beat him with a broom handle			1
he had a little tax problem with the @entity68 and put out a 1992 album called " the @entity70 : who 'll buy my memories ? " to pay his multimillion - dollar debts			0
but who would want a flawless @entity10 ? on tuesday , @entity10 turns 80			1
( some well - known friends -- and everyday fans -- sent him their wishes			0
) he 'll be playing music , of course -- the @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83 , according to his website			1
what else would he do ? " i seem to be happier when i 'm working , " he told the @entity86 in 1995			0
" i tend to get into trouble with too much time on my hands			0
" that 's ok , @entity10			1
we hope you never stop .			0
