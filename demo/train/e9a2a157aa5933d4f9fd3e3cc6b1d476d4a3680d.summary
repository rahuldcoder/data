-- brits abroad might sometimes garner a reputation on a par with " ugly @entity4 , " yet they rarely elicit a reaction as strong as one coming out of @entity7 this week			1
following the killing of a young @entity11 tourist on @entity12 last week , the @entity7 island is considering setting up segregated nightlife zones for tourists -- and other tourist hot spots in the country may follow suit			1
@entity19 , a 19 - year - old @entity20 , was stabbed in a brawl outside a bar in the @entity12 resort of @entity24 on july 23 while celebrating his birthday			0
the death comes in the wake of news that three @entity11 women have reportedly been raped in @entity24 in the past week			2
@entity30 young @entity11 tourists , often abroad for the first time , form the bulk of visitors to @entity24 , as they do to resorts notorious for debauched behavior on other @entity7 islands			1
closely followed by @entity38 , @entity11 outnumber any other nationality visiting @entity7			1
@entity19 's death has lent impetus to @entity24 's consideration of plans to establish tourist " ghettos " in a strip outside the town , following increasing complaints from islanders			1
new planning laws would allow clubs , bars and quad - bike racecourses to be established in a closely monitored enclave away from the town center , the @entity49 reports			0
" we are considering ... setting up special zones outside the town ... for young visitors who insist on behaving like this and locals who want to go on hosting them , " said @entity56 , mayor of the town @entity58 , author of one of the most popular online @entity7 travel guides , @entity61 , says has become like the @entity68 " with moussaka			2
" island summit @entity24 's plan is attracting interest from other @entity7 islands flooded by pleasure - seeking tourists in the summer high season			1
the mayors of @entity77 , @entity12 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 are to hold a mini-summit in @entity82 later this year , where the issue of riotous tourists will be discussed			0
" as we all face similar problems , we will meet in october to discuss taking further measures to deal with them , " @entity56 said			0
@entity7 faces a dilemma in implementing measures such as @entity24 's proposed tourist zone , which would in effect punish some travelers to the country			1
with its sunny weather , beautiful beaches and widely appealing cuisine , @entity7 -- especially its thousands of islands -- has long presented a paradise to tourists from colder , grayer northern @entity101 climes			1
package tours with the explosion of package tourism in the 1960s and 1970s , @entity7 became accessible to young people who previously would n't have been able to afford foreign travel			2
tourism some time ago surpassed shipping as the country 's largest industry and is responsible for 20 % of its income			0
the @entity7 economic crisis makes imposing sanctions upon tourists difficult , but the country 's dependence on the industry has long had a flip side			1
escaping home has often meant escaping its moral restraints , especially for young , relatively inexperienced travelers			0
increasingly popular all - inclusive holiday packages , including free drinks , in many @entity7 resorts exacerbate the tendency to wildly licentious behavior -- " brits being bad abroad , " in shorthand			2
" tour operators [ and ] commission - seeking reps " even encourage such behavior on @entity12 and other islands , according to the @entity134			0
however , it seems that , despite the money , some @entity7 have had enough			2
" @entity7 ca n't go on being a playground for everyone to live out his or her desire , " @entity56 told the @entity49			0
will it work ? would @entity24 's plan for a tourist " ghetto " work ? the island needs " to train their police to deal with all possible situations , " @entity58 tells @entity0 , " plus hold individual clubs accountable for the behavior of their patrons			1
" sending young people off to some party ghetto where they can do whatever they want is not going to make them behave responsibly			0
it just sends the message that anything goes in these areas			0

stabbing of @entity11 teen spurs resort 's plans for tourist ' ghetto '
other @entity7 islands also to consider proposal
@entity7 long considered *hedonistic* paradise for @entity11 travelers
now some @entity7 have apparently had enough
