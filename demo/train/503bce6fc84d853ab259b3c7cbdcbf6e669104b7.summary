-- older women have a slightly increased risk of dying at an earlier age if they take multivitamins or certain other dietary supplements , according to a new study published today in the @entity7			1
of the 15 supplements included in the study , iron was most strongly linked to an increased risk of earlier death			1
women who took iron supplements were 10 % more likely to die during the 22 - year study than women who did not take them , even after the researchers controlled for several other health and demographic factors			1
folic acid , vitamin @entity22 , magnesium , zinc , copper , and multivitamins were also associated with an increased risk of earlier death			1
@entity28 was the only supplement associated with a lower risk of death during the study			1
" i do n't think we really know enough to be prescribing supplements , " says @entity32 , @entity33 , the senior author of the study and a professor of public health at the @entity37 , in @entity38			1
@entity32 stresses , however , that people who have been prescribed dietary supplements for a specific vitamin or nutrient deficiency should not stop taking them without consulting their doctor			1
@entity0 : which vitamins do you need ? the study -- which shows only an association , not cause and effect -- has some key shortcomings			2
the researchers measured supplement intake using questionnaires that relied on the memory of the participants , for instance			0
in addition , the researchers do n't know whether the women were taking supplements for a health problem			2
the increases in death risk might therefore be due to underlying health conditions rather than the supplements themselves , says @entity69 , @entity33 , a professor of community and preventive medicine at the @entity72 , in @entity73 , @entity74 " people [ often ] go to the vitamin store because they feel something is n't right -- their memory is slipping , they do n't have as much energy , " says @entity69 , who was not involved in the new study			1
" these could be subconscious symptoms of a disease that is eventually going to take their life			0

according to the study , roughly half of all adults reported taking supplements in 2000			2
the rates were even higher among the 38,772 women in @entity96 who participated in the study			0
sixty - three percent were taking at least one supplement when the study began , in 1986 , but by 2004 that number had jumped to 85 %			0
and more than one - quarter of those women reported taking four or more supplements on a regular basis			2
the women were 62 years old at the beginning of the study , on average , and none had chronic health conditions ( with the exception of diabetes and high blood pressure )			0
just over 40 % of the women had died by the time the study ended in 2008			0
women who took calcium -- which is known to reduce the risk of bone fractures associated with aging -- were 9 % less likely to die during the study than women who did not take it , but most of the other supplements were associated with an increased risk of death			1
some supplements , including beta - carotene , vitamins a and @entity131 , and selenium , did n't appear to affect death risk either way			1
@entity0 : 11 foods for healthy bones however , the increases in death risk ( or decrease , in the case of calcium ) were extremely small and may not be clinically meaningful , says @entity142 , a professor of pharmacy practice at the @entity144 , in @entity145			1
several factors besides supplement use may have shaped the results			0
@entity69 points out , for instance , that the use of hormone therapy to treat the symptoms of menopause was nearly twice as common among supplement users as among nonusers			0
some forms of hormone therapy have been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and breast cancer			1
the researchers did take hormone therapy into account in their analysis , along with several other potentially mitigating factors ( including age , educational attainment , body mass index , diet , and physical activity )			0
but the wide disparity in hormone use between supplement users and nonusers may indicate that the two groups of women were different in subtle yet important ways , @entity69 says			0
@entity0 : can supplements ease menopause symptoms ? " people choosing to take [ hormone ] replacement therapy often have underlying different characteristics and lifestyle behaviors , which you ca n't necessarily balance out with a mathematical model , " she says			2
it 's not clear that the study results apply to the population of older women as a whole			0
the study participants were white and tended to live in rural areas , so the findings ca n't necessarily be generalized to other races and geographic areas			0
still , the study is a reminder that supplements may not be as harmless as they seem , @entity69 says			2
" taking more of what we think is a good thing may not be so good , " she says			0
" high levels of nutrient supplements may be harmful , or at least not helpful			0

the use of dietary supplements has exploded in the @entity89 in recent decades
folic acid , vitamin @entity22 , magnesium , zinc and copper pose an increased risk
@entity217 was most strongly linked to an increased risk of earlier death -- calcium was the least
increases in death risk were extremely small and may not be clinically meaningful
