@entity2 @entity0 of thousands of pro-life activists descended on @entity2 on thursday for the annual @entity4 , marking the 42nd anniversary of the @entity8 's @entity7 decision that made abortion legal — by promising to end it			1
by the size of the crowds and the enthusiasm of the speakers , it was impossible to tell that just the night before , @entity17 leaders on @entity18 had spiked one of social conservatives ' biggest priorities , a bill banning abortion after the 20th week of pregnancy			1
the scramble over the bill behind closed doors was the latest in a series of conflicts within the caucus , and again underscored the challenge facing the @entity17 as they head into a presidential election year : how to expand the party 's appeal with untapped demographic groups , while still appeasing their conservative base			1
that was the concern raised by rep. @entity38 , the @entity39 @entity17 who , along with a group of @entity17 women and centrists in the party , led the successful effort to get the bill pulled			1
" the first vote we take , or the second vote , or the fifth vote , should n't be on an issue where we know that millennials — social issues just are n't as important [ to them ] , " she told @entity48 last week			0
@entity38 and rep. @entity57 pulled their sponsorships because of concerns over a requirement that rape victims file a police report to get an exemption from the ban			0
other centrist @entity17 expressed concerns on thursday that the party should be focusing on less controversial issues with broader appeal			1
" this appeared to be messaging bill , and the message that was being sent was not a very good one , " @entity70 rep @entity70 of @entity71 said			0
" i would prefer that our party spent less time focusing on these very contentious social issues , because that distracts us from broader economic messages where i think we have much greater appeal to the larger public , " he said			0
the @entity17 has long faced significant issues in wooing single female voters and young voters , which contributed to its unexpected loss of the @entity88 in 2012			1
after that election , an @entity90 post-mortem report diagnosing the party 's problems suggested the @entity17 " must in fact and deed be inclusive and welcoming " on social issues			2
see also : @entity88 @entity17 leaders cave on abortion bill but as centrists in the party look to move away from the abortion issue , they 'll run up against fierce opposition from social conservatives , who were calling for revenge against @entity38 and other lawmakers who led the effort to drop the bill			1
@entity110 , president of the pro-life @entity111 , told @entity1 she met with @entity88 majority leader @entity112 on wednesday night and was " shocked and surprised " when she was told they would n't be bringing the bill to a floor for a vote			1
" no one ever brought up any of these issues			0
no one ever brought it up in the @entity122 races where we injected it in the middle of the campaign , " she said			0
" [ @entity88 @entity17 ] have managed to really pull [ defeat ] out of the jaws of victory for sure			1
" @entity88 leadership has told her that the bill will eventually come up for a vote , but gave her no time line			1
a leadership aide said lawmakers are going to discuss how to move forward with the bill , but it 's not clear what 's next for it			1
@entity110 said @entity38 is almost certain to face a primary challenge in 2012			0
" my phone does not stop ringing with people asking me , what are we going to do about her next year ? i want to stay focused on getting the bill passed — but some people ... there 's no protecting some people once they 've gone past the tipping point , " she said			0
@entity38 represents a @entity17 - leaning district and won her last primary with less than 60 % support , so the threat of a challenge in 2016 over the abortion issue is a significant one for her			1
but it 's less clear how the issue will play out for the @entity17 as a whole			2
this time last year , the @entity90 passed a resolution urging @entity17 candidates to speak out on the abortion issue on the campaign trail , and attendees at the event , including @entity90 chairman @entity168 , said it was a winning issue			2
this time around , @entity168 was elsewhere , and @entity17 made little mention the abortion issue at their winter meeting			2
most of the @entity17 's likely presidential contenders kept mum on the developments on @entity18			2
@entity177 , who was the favorite of social conservatives during the 2012 race and is contemplating another run , was relatively subdued about leadership pulling the bill			2
" i 'm disappointed , " he said , " but leadership is just doing what good leadership does — which is listen to its members and try to work out a bill that is acceptable to the most within the caucus			0
" and few dozen protesters , mostly college students and older activists , gathered outside @entity38 ' office after the march to express their frustration with her move			0
one , @entity198 president @entity197 , called @entity38 a " coward " for previously supporting a similar bill , before working to block this one			0
but asked whether candidates should run on the abortion issue if they hope to appeal to millennials , she demurred			0
" obviously , there are a ton of important issues that millennials care about ... but i think they should n't shy away from it , " she said .			0
