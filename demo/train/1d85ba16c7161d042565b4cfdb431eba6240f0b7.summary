-- @entity1 recalls a 1984 game against the @entity3 when he was streaking up the field and an opposing player slammed into him			1
one helmet plowed into another			0
@entity1 's head snapped back , his helmet was knocked askew			1
" he blew me up , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity9			1
" i do n't remember the second half of that game , but i do remember that hit			0
" @entity1 compared the hit to a freight train hitting a @entity16			1
these days @entity1 is worried about the cumulative effects of hits like the one @entity19 laid on him that day			1
in the past two years , @entity1 's memory has given him increasing trouble			1
on monday , doctors at @entity25 told @entity1 , 59 , he has chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or @entity23 , the @entity22 said			1
@entity23 is a progressive degenerative brain disease found in some athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma			1
the only way to definitely diagnose @entity23 is after death , by analyzing brain tissue and finding microscopic clumps of an abnormal protein called tau , which has been found in the brains of dozens of former @entity38 players			1
opinion : why i 'm saying goodbye to football however , a pilot study at @entity25 may have found tau in the brains of living retired players			1
some scientists say finding the disease in the brains of living players is the " holy grail " of @entity23 research , providing a means to diagnose and treat it , and the @entity25 study may be an important first step			1
using a scan called a positron emission tomography , or @entity57 , typically used to measure nascent alzheimer 's disease , researchers inject the players with a radioactive marker that travels through the body , crosses the blood - brain barrier and latches on to tau			1
then , the players ' brains are scanned			2
" we found ( the tau ) in their brains			0
it lit up , " dr. @entity68 , professor of psychiatry at the @entity70 at @entity25 and lead author of the study , said in february			2
dr. @entity74 , a neurosurgeon who works with the @entity75 , cautioned thursday that the @entity23 diagnoses of @entity1 ( and two other living former players ) need further study			1
" this is very , very preliminary , " he told sportsradio 93 - 7 the fan in @entity80			2
" there are many , many causes of dementia or progressive memory loss , particularly when you get over 60 or 70 years of age			1
... it 's something to obviously be concerned about , and the question is what can be done about it ? " @entity1 said the diagnosis explains a lot about his forgetting where he is driving and his mood swings			1
" memory loss , more so than anything it 's been my big deal , " he said			1
" sometimes you can have sensitivity to light and things like that			0
but my thing was not remembering			2
i 've been taking my daughters to practice for years and all of a sudden i forget how to get there			2
" his daughters are afraid , he said			0
they wonder which father they will get			0
will he be the happy dad or the one in a bad mood			0
for others known to have had @entity23 , symptoms include depression , aggression and disorientation			0
in 2002 , @entity118 , a @entity120 center for the @entity75 , was the first former @entity38 player to be diagnosed with @entity23			2
after his retirement , @entity118 suffered from amnesia , dementia , depression and bone and muscle pain			0
what you need to know about concussions in the @entity38 unlike @entity118 , who spent his career smashing into opposition linemen many times a game and in practice , @entity1 was a superfast running back who made his enemies miss by darting past them or with a quick spin to avoid contact			1
he won the @entity136 as college football 's best player in 1976 and became an instant @entity38 star on the league 's most popular team , the @entity140			0
he played 11 seasons and gained 12,739 yards , eighth best of all time			2
his 99 - yard run in 1982 is an @entity38 record			0
he was inducted into the @entity120 in 1994			0
now he looks in a mirror and wonders			0
" and i say who are you ? what are you becoming ? " he said			0
" it 's very frustrating to be a person that 's been so outgoing , then all of a sudden , i 'm like a couch potato			1
" other athletes have demonstrated erratic behavior , such as @entity75 offensive lineman @entity157 , 36 , who died in a 2004 high - speed chase			0
@entity160 wide receiver @entity159 died at age 26 after falling from the bed of a moving pickup during a fight with his @entity166 © e. opinion : @entity38 takes good first step to protect players some who showed signs of the disease have taken their own lives , including former @entity3 defensive back @entity174 , who shot himself in 2006 ; @entity175 , a former @entity75 offensive lineman who killed himself by drinking antifreeze ; and @entity178 , the former linebacker who killed himself last year at the age of 43			1
@entity1 said that wo n't happen to him			1
" i 'm going to beat this			0
trust me , " he said			0
@entity1 pins much of the blame for his health issues on team owners			2
he said a $ 765 million settlement of a concussion lawsuit with the @entity38 was not enough			0
" i ca n't put a price on my health			0
the owners knew ( about the dangers of concussions ) for years and they looked the other way , and they kept putting us players in harm 's way			2
" the deal calls for the @entity38 to pay for medical exams , concussion - related compensation , medical research for retired @entity38 players and their families , and litigation expenses , according to a court document filed in @entity206 in @entity207			2
the agreement still needs to be approved by the judge assigned to the case , which involved more than 4,500 plaintiffs			0
@entity38 concussion settlement raises questions			0

@entity1 was a *finesse* running back who for 11 years often made opponents miss
at 59 he has been told he has a brain disease usually diagnosed in dead players
one neurosurgeon said there are different causes for memory loss , so more study is needed
@entity1 says he is becoming a less outgoing person who has trouble remembering directions
