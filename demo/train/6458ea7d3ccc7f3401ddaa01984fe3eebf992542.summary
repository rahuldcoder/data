as @entity1 remains in a medically induced coma fighting for her life , little information about the incident at her @entity6 - area home or her condition has slipped from police or family			1
if the investigation into what happened to the 21 - year - old only child of @entity15 has revealed much , no one is talking publicly about it			1
we do know this : @entity1 was discovered facedown in a bathtub at her @entity20 , @entity21 , home over the weekend , and she was reportedly found by the man she has called her husband , and a friend			1

" she also spoke to @entity47 about how much she missed her mother , who died february 11 , 2012			2
days before @entity1 's hospitalization , her @entity55 timeline seemed to indicate her mother and her own singing career were quite on her mind			1

allthetime ! i need2be in the studio @entity73 ! # @entity74 ! " she was found saturday unresponsive in her @entity20 townhome			0
nobody knows what caused @entity1 's unresponsiveness , @entity20 police spokeswoman @entity81 said , but police have said they consider it a medical incident			1
investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug - or alcohol - related			0
the incident report referenced a drowning			0
police had been to @entity1 's residence recently			1
somebody reported a fight there on january 23 , but nobody answered the door and officers found no evidence of an altercation , @entity81 said			0
@entity100 @entity1 called him her husband , but her father 's attorney released a statement saying the two were never married			1
@entity1 reportedly got engaged to @entity100 , and in january 2014 , she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings , along with the words , " # @entity109 so # @entity110			1

@entity100 had lived with @entity15 and her daughter since he was 12 years old			1
he once told the show " extra " that @entity15 treated him like a son and " made me promise several times to look after @entity1 ... and , @entity121 , i will never , ever , ever break that promise			1
" @entity100 was one of the two people who reportedly found @entity1 unresponsive in the tub			1
@entity125 @entity125 , 24 , was the other			0
in response to several media outlets reporting @entity125 ' lengthy rap sheet , attorney @entity129 issued a statement tuesday saying his client is a cooperative witness and @entity125 ' most recent arrest in january has nothing to do with @entity1 's hospitalization			2
@entity129 told @entity0 on wednesday that his client was the one who actually found @entity1 and called 911			2

on january 15 , @entity125 was booked on charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute , possession of alprazolam ( aka @entity144 , an anti-anxiety drug ) , and possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of or the attempt to commit a felony , according to @entity153 spokeswoman @entity152			0

@entity129 did not mention the previous arrests in his statement			0
" mr. @entity125 ' widely reported recent arrest is completely unrelated to the incidents that occurred at ms. @entity1 's residence and there is absolutely no relationship between the events			2
he has pleaded not guilty to those charges , " @entity129 said			0
" mr. @entity125 has not been accused of anything in connection with @entity1 's injuries			2
" @entity32 @entity1 's father is as much known for his shenanigans as he is for his music , if not more			1

the band would eventually splinter into three relatively successful solo acts and the @entity189 trio , @entity190			0
upon leaving @entity183 ( it 's debatable what precipitated his departure as competing narratives suggest he either left voluntarily or was voted out by fellow band members ) , he embarked on a solo career that stuttered at first but eventually spawned numerous hits , including " @entity198 , " " @entity199 " and " @entity200 , " before fizzling in the 1990s			2
he married @entity15 in 1992 , and the story line surrounding @entity1 would quickly become one of cocaine , booze , rehab , arrests and alleged violence against @entity15 , who filed for divorce in 2006			1

her first no. 1 hit would come in 1985 with " @entity228 , " and a string of no. 1 hits followed , as did a marginally successful acting career			0
however , she would not enjoy the spoils of , say , a @entity233 because she did n't write and produce her own songs			0
in an interview in 2002 with @entity237 's @entity236 , @entity15 admitted to using drugs but denied the use of crack			2

i 'm either my best friend or my worst enemy			0
" @entity15 bounced in and out of drug rehab twice , declaring herself drug - free during a 2009 interview with @entity47			2
