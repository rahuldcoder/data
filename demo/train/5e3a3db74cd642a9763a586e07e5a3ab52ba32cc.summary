@entity0 , @entity1 -- almost hidden in the spectacular red rock country of northwestern @entity1 is a tiny charity that educates and houses almost 200 @entity7 children and their families			1
the @entity9 , affiliated with the @entity10 , mostly survives on donations , which it promises to use wisely			0
the need is apparent once you step onto the grounds			0
and that 's why mission executives agreed to work with one of the world 's largest direct mail companies , which solicits donations for hundreds of nonprofit and charity clients in the @entity23			1
they wanted to raise as much money as they could			0
they signed a contract with @entity28 in 2008 and , according to internal financial statements , saw more than $ 9 million in donations flow in over a four - year period			1
but almost none of the money went to the mission			0
instead , school officials acknowledge that the mission owes more than $ 5 million to @entity36 and evidence suggests that several other charities also owe the company huge sums of money it raises questions about how much of the billions of dollars @entity23 donate each year actually help the intended charities , something that the @entity46 is exploring as part of its ongoing investigation into another charity linked to @entity50			1
on tuesday , the committee issued questions to @entity54 officials to explore how the company raised money for the @entity57 , it said			1
in response , @entity50 said , it " volunteered " some information to the committee and will cooperate with the investigation			1
in addition to the @entity46 inquiry , attorneys general for @entity65 and @entity66 are investigating @entity50 for possible fraudulent practices , sources say			1
the company has provided documents to @entity65 investigators , multiple sources confirm to @entity2			0
and sources say @entity66 officials have also requested documents from key @entity54 executives			1
the executive director of @entity9 , @entity78 , went to @entity65 to meet with @entity54 officials after being contacted by @entity2 , sources said			1
in an e-mail , @entity78 wrote that the debt was the result of a " pilot program " that did not succeed			0
" in this effort @entity50 / @entity84 ( @entity85 is an affiliated marketing services company ) agreed to finance the mailings and bear the risk of any losses if the campaign did not succeed , " @entity78 said in that email			1
" unfortunately , this project started just a month before the recession began and was not profitable			0
accordingly , the mission negotiated with @entity50 / @entity85 to end the pilot project early and @entity50 / @entity85 concurred			1
as had been agreed , the mission now owes @entity50 / @entity84 nothing for this pilot project , " @entity78 also told @entity2			1
" @entity50 has helped enable the mission to deliver water and food services and keep its school open during lean economic times by allowing the @entity9 to delay repayment of part of its bills on generous , no interest payment terms			2
" but the @entity10 , which has overall responsibility for the @entity99 , says it knew nothing of the debt until it was contacted by @entity2			0
" we have serious concerns about that company , " said @entity111 , an attorney for the diocese			0
" and the fact that they reached out to an entity in our diocese and potentially would jeopardize these good services , educational and otherwise that are being provided			0
" in an e-mail , @entity54 spokewoman @entity125 wrote , " sometimes the program is successful , and sometimes it results in a net loss for @entity36 " she added , " we are proud of our ability to take on start - up organizations that do not have an email list , donor file or the money on hand that it takes to build a long - term , revenue - producing direct mail program			1
" in a web video posted by @entity54 ceo @entity135 to his company 's clients , he did not address directly the question of state or @entity46 investigations			1
" not once have we been fined ; not once have we ever been charged , " @entity135 said			0
" we get inquiries all the time from states " because forms are filled out incorrectly			0
other charities @entity147 financial documents show that at least 11 charities now owe the company millions of dollars , a result of direct mail campaigns failing to bring in enough money from donations to cover the cost of the campaigns themselves			1
in a statement , a @entity54 spokesman said the financial information was " grossly inaccurate " when it came to profit numbers			2
the company further stated that " a complete , independent , third party audit of @entity50 's financial information has indicated that @entity50 has not made any net profit on the accounts you list			2
" spokesmen for several @entity54 charity clients acknowledge that they owe the company amounts ranging from about $ 200,000 to millions of dollars			1
leading the list of charities owing money to @entity50 is the @entity174 - based @entity57			1
the @entity46 began investigating the foundation 's tax - exempt status after a series of @entity2 reports broadcast in may			2
@entity180 investigators have been examining the foundation amid accusations of creating misleading representations in a direct mail campaign authored by @entity50 , according to the state @entity185			1
documents show that the @entity57 owes @entity50 more than $ 15 million			1
as part of their investigation , @entity180 officials say the foundation , which says it has raised nearly $ 70 million in donations since 2007 , has also acknowledged an extraordinary payment to another charity			1
according to documents obtained under the @entity196 , the @entity57 agreed to pay $ 325,000 to a charity called the @entity198			2
a letter from the @entity198 's chief operating officer , @entity200 , says the payment was because of a " striking resemblance " between letters appealing for money on behalf of the @entity57 and similar letters mailed on behalf of the @entity198			0
" it appeared that our proprietary information and intellectual property rights had been violated , " the letter stated			0
in the settlement agreement , @entity50 did not admit to any wrongdoing , and the veterans charity said the agreement " speaks for itself			1
" the @entity57 also said the mailings in question were out the door before the settlement could be agreed upon			0
despite the huge payment , nowhere in the @entity57 's mailings to prospective donors did it acknowledge that donated funds would be used to pay for a out - of - court settlement to another charity			0
the common denominator between the two charities is their direct - mail fundraiser , @entity50			1
the memorial foundation , which plans to build a statue and memorial to disabled veterans on @entity230 near the @entity231 , stopped using @entity54 in 2008 , five months before the settlement agreement was reached			2
as for the @entity57 , it has embarked on an expensive new mailing campaign , launched after the @entity46 began its investigation			2
on behalf of the charity , @entity50 said , it sent 750,000 letters , each with a $ 1 bill enclosed , in an effort to raise more money			1
@entity243 , a veteran of more than 50 years of direct - mail fundraising on behalf of nonprofits and charities , offered his opinion on the ethics and legalities of surrounding @entity50 and similar outfits : " the fact that ( that ) company puts forth money for this purpose is not unethical per se			1
it 's not illegal per se , " he said			0
" but what is problematic is ... if the charity is promising to do something with the money that the donor sends and there 's no money going to it ... if no money has gone to the charitable purpose , then that 's fraudulent			2
" " big mistake " the ceo of another @entity50 client , a @entity271 - based charity called help the children , said he had made a " big mistake " in signing a contract with the company			1
@entity276 said he tried to cancel the contract a year after signing it but was unable to do so			0
he said @entity50 told him that help the @entity279 owed $ 285,000 , and the charity could n't pay it			1
ultimately , the debt was whittled down to less than $ 200,000 , @entity276 said , which was still money he did not have			2
of the roughly $ 800,000 raised in donations by the @entity50 campaign , @entity276 said , his charity kept about $ 32,000 : less than 5 %			1
" so we had to take money out of our reserves to keep our programs going ( to ) fulfill what we said we would do			0
and in the meantime , we 're the ones who are struggling , and they 're the one who is doing extremely well			0
" asked whether he felt that @entity50 had " ripped him off , " @entity276 replied , " oh , yeah			2
" but after @entity2 asked @entity50 for its reaction , @entity276 retracted his statements			2
@entity276 acknowledged that before he spoke to @entity2 , he e-mailed a @entity54 executive , saying that unless he was let out of his contract , he would go to @entity2 with his story			2
in less than an hour , a @entity54 executive agreed			2
" i think it is in everyone 's interest to end this and move on , " the executive wrote back			0
despite his agreement with @entity50 , @entity308 granted an on - camera interview anyway			0
two days later , @entity2 received a phone call from a @entity50 spokesman , and presgrove himself wrote @entity2 , saying he wanted to retract what he had said			0
the @entity54 spokesman also said @entity276 's interview should be retracted because he had just undergone a medical procedure and was in no condition to answer questions			0
@entity50 claimed that @entity2 had " dragged " him to an interview			0
still later , @entity276 texted @entity2 , asking not to air the interview : " i have to get out of this contract and that was the deal			0
no interview and i 'm out			0
