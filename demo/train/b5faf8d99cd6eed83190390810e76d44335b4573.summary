-- @entity1 is a celebrity blogger who dishes out the latest @entity4 gossip , but there 's something about his personal life you may not know			1
latino gays say they face a double dose of discrimination			1
@entity1 is a @entity13 pioneer			1
he is one of the first latino public figures in the @entity15 to be openly gay			1
while @entity16 have broken ground on the @entity15 @entity20 , in @entity4 and in professional sports , gay @entity16 in the nation 's public arena remain largely invisible			1
@entity1 says deep - seated homophobia within the @entity13 community has forced many gay @entity16 to go underground , but attitudes are shifting			1
" at the beginning , when i came out to my mom , she reacted with a sigh and said , ' you 're my son and i have to love you , ' " @entity1 says			1
" but now she says , ' you 're the best son in the world , and we need to find you a man			0
' " some gay @entity13 leaders are starting to share @entity1 's optimism			1
the @entity13 community has long had a reputation for being notoriously homophobic			1
but some surprising developments within the @entity13 world -- in the @entity15 and abroad -- suggest that may be changing , gay scholars and activists say			1
' walls are starting to crumble ' " a lot of walls are starting to crumble , " says @entity42 , a @entity43 - based author whose fiction has appeared in books such as " @entity46 : @entity43			0
" " we 're at a crossroads , " he says			0
" a new generation of better - educated @entity16 is coming of age			1
" gay @entity13 activists point to several signs of this transformation : @entity56 , one of the oldest and largest @entity59 - language newspapers in the @entity15 , recently endorsed the rights of same - sex couples to marry			2
within the past three years , lawmakers in countries as diverse as @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 have passed laws granting rights and protections to gays and lesbians			0
@entity72 , lead singer of the popular pop @entity66 band @entity73 , recently announced that he was gay			2
" he was n't rejected by any of his band mates or fans , " @entity1 says of @entity72			1
" that 's a huge step for gay visibility in the @entity13 media world			2
" and far away from the stage , even some of the most vulnerable gay @entity16 -- ordinary students in public high schools -- are finding more support , one group says			1
while many gay @entity13 students still face physical and verbal harassment from classmates and teachers , more are becoming bolder about affirming their sexual identity , a recent survey found			1
a 2007 survey conducted by the @entity93 discovered that at schools where a @entity97 club existed , 59 percent of gay @entity13 students participated in the club , says @entity99 , a senior researcher at the network			2
the survey defined gay youths as those who were lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender			2
the network also says that since 1999 , at least 4,000 gay student alliances have formed groups at public and private schools in the @entity15			1
" while harassment in schools for @entity13 gay students remained high , we also know that these students have more support than in past generations , " @entity99 says			2
at least one @entity118 scholar is now even questioning a fundamental assumption about homophobia in the @entity13 community			2
@entity122 , president of @entity123 , a lesbian and bisexual support group , says the notion that @entity13 people are more homophobic and its men more macho is not only false , but tinged with racism			0
men from all sorts of ethnic groups have long acted in a patriarchal manner , but only @entity13 men have the term " machismo " attached to their behavior , she says			0
" people tend to think that somehow , we 're more repressed and living in the @entity142 , " says @entity122 , a professor at @entity137 in @entity138 , @entity139			0
" they forget that just as things are changing in the @entity15 , they 're also changing in @entity146 , " she says			0
the walls that still stand yet @entity122 and others also say that being gay and @entity13 presents special challenges			2
like other gay people of color , @entity13 gays face a double bind : discrimination from mainstream culture and from their own community , @entity122 says			1
this double bind presents an obstacle to @entity16 who consider coming out , @entity122 says			1
their challenge : risking rejection from their family when they need their family as a refuge from racism , she says			0
" the family is the unit that provides the support and the one place that people can feel free and protected , " @entity122 says			0
" it becomes doubly difficult for people to come out			0
" those who take that risk may pay a price			0
@entity175 , a gay poet and spoken word artist , says he almost destroyed himself because he could n't find acceptance within the @entity13 community			1
the @entity43 - based poet says he grew up knowing that his sexual identity infuriated other @entity16			1
he once saw kids pelt a gay @entity13 hairdresser with stones			2
he routinely heard @entity185 priests condemn homosexuals			0
his own mother called him names when she discovered he was gay , says @entity175 , editor of " @entity189 : a modern anthology of @entity191			2
" @entity175 says he was so filled with self - loathing that he once sold drugs and engaged in risky sexual behavior			0
" i became all those things society expected me to become , " he says			0
" i thought that was the only thing i could be			2
" @entity175 says he decided to ditch his reckless lifestyle and become a poet			0
he reconciled with his mother and took on a new mission			0
he wanted to show others that one could be @entity13 , gay and proud			2
" fortunately , i walked away unscathed , " he says of his earlier days			0
" i thought that @entity202 had given me a second chance , and i felt like i had to do something with that			1
" @entity16 like @entity175 who decide to become activists , though , may run into an unexpected problem			1
how do you organize a community that is so fragmented ? people often talk about the @entity13 community in the @entity15 as if it is one community			2
yet @entity13 leaders often point out that there is not one @entity13 community in the @entity15 , but many			0
a @entity15 citizen from @entity218 , for example , may not appreciate being called a @entity66			0
politics , food , history -- they all differ among various @entity13 groups in the @entity15 @entity223 , a gay @entity13 activist and journalist , says those differences can make it difficult to mobilize support for @entity13 gay issues			1
" it 's difficult to get united around a single issue , " says @entity223 , whose blogging name is " @entity232			0
" " when people are trying to form a @entity13 voice , it 's difficult because you have different cultures with different visions and goals , " @entity223 says			0
for now , @entity1 , the @entity4 blogger , may seem like a coalition of one -- a @entity13 public figure who is proud of being gay			1
but he says he does n't feel isolated			0
" i really do n't think i 'm alone , " he says			0
" i do n't feel alone			0
" he says that gay @entity16 who decide to stop living undercover will become more commonplace in the future			1
" it 's tough -- i 'm not saying it 's not there , " @entity1 says of homophobia in the @entity13 community			1
" but as time goes on , it will change			0
