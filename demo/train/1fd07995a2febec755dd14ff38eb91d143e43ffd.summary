@entity0 , @entity1 -- several thousand demonstrators marched through this industrial port city in a mostly peaceful protest against an upcoming summit of the world 's group of eight wealthiest countries			1
activists from an eclectic mix of labor unions , leftist political parties , and environmentalist and women 's rights groups participated in the march through @entity0 's mostly deserted streets , under the slogan " @entity19			1
" @entity20 means " get lost			2
" it was also a rallying cry for the revolution in @entity23 last january that toppled @entity25 - backed dictator @entity24 @entity24			2
the protest is being held days ahead of the summit			2
on wednesday , leaders from the @entity29 , @entity1 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 will converge in the coastal resort of @entity37 , more than 20 miles away from @entity0			2
" no , of course they are not welcome here , " said @entity38 , who held a sign denouncing government cutbacks in social services			0
" if it was the @entity46 , like all of the countries of the @entity49 , then they would be welcome here			0
" " @entity37 is the capital of the grand bourgeoisie in @entity1 , " said union activist @entity50 , referring to @entity37 's reputation as an exclusive playground for the @entity1 aristocracy			1
" it is a symbol of the bourgeoisie			0
" " we are part of the protest here because we feel that with all the issues that are being discussed here , whether it be trade or the crisis , it 's always that women are left behind , voices of women are never heard , " said @entity57 , a @entity58 activist with the group @entity59			1
after marching peacefully for several hours , several younger , black - clad members of the protest began smashing shop windows and spray - painting anarchy signs on store fronts , sending several city residents running in panic down a side street			0
a half dozen plain - clothes police officers who had infiltrated the march tried to detain one of the suspected vandals			0
the young man resisted , prompting other anarchists to come to his rescue			0
they hurled stones at the undercover police officers and chased them as they fled the scene			0
for the moment , the suspect escaped arrest			0
moments later , the anarchists clashed with fellow @entity93 protesters			0
they threw paint and oil at security volunteers from one of the largest labor unions organizing the protest when they were barred from entering the main grounds where a concert was to be held			0
large international summits and meetings of the world 's largest financial institutions are regular targets of anti-globalization demonstrators , whose radical fringes often engage in vandalism and clashes with police			1
" we are clearly against violence , " said @entity50 , who was a member of the protest 's volunteer security force			1
" but there are always some provocateurs			0
" though the demonstrators were clearly from the left wing of the political spectrum , there was little to no mention of the disgraced former @entity125 chief @entity124			1
up until his arrest in @entity127 last saturday , @entity124 was widely considered to be the @entity129 's best hope for wresting the presidency away from @entity131 in next year 's presidential election			1
saturday 's @entity93 protesters had little positive to say about @entity124			1
" he 's not a good candidate of the left , " said @entity50 , the labor activist			2
" he is a member of the grand bourgeoisie , " he added , referring to @entity124 's vast wealth , and his residences in @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 , which are widely reported to be worth millions of dollars .			1
