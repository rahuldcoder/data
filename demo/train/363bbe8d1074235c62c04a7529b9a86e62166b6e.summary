-- @entity2 's defense budget is headed for a big reduction , as a result of the congressional super committee 's failure to reach a debt reduction compromise			1
the automatic 10 - year budget cut of more than half a trillion dollars now facing the military is reminiscent of a strategic decision @entity11 confronted nearly a century ago			1
when the empire had to address the profound debts it accrued during @entity15 , the answer was the ten year rule			1
formulated in 1919 , this rule dominated @entity11 's defense planning throughout the 1920s			1
it worked on a simple , rolling assumption : " that the @entity22 will not be engaged in any great war during the next 10 years			0
" as long as the planning assumption held , the government could assume strategic risk by reducing the military 's size , deferring its modernization programs and delaying improvements to base protection			2
@entity32 , chancellor of the exchequer during much of this time , was its most famous proponent			0
observing on several occasions that there was no foreseeable danger of war with @entity38 , he cautioned @entity11 against building any ships or bases that might alarm the @entity38 government			1
indeed , @entity32 's voice was decisive in @entity11 's decision to delay strengthening the @entity45 's vital base in @entity46 during the 1920s			1
although the @entity16 saved the @entity22 much money in the short term , the calculated risk turned into dashed hopes in the 1930s			2
in short succession , @entity38 conquered @entity55 in 1932 , @entity53 rose to power in 1933 and suddenly a world war loomed on the horizon			2
@entity11 finally repealed the rule in 1932 -- the same year @entity55 fell			1
as @entity11 's weakened position in @entity62 became evident , the government realized it was in no position militarily or financially to address the challenges it now confronted			1
through its inaction , @entity11 signaled @entity67 of its leadership role in @entity62 and of its ability to meet its continental commitment to @entity72 allies			1
thus , in 1939 @entity11 entered @entity73 with a woefully inadequate military			1
the inadequacies of this force were best symbolized by the fall of @entity46 in 1942 and the surrender of 80,000 @entity22 - led troops to the @entity38 invaders			0
the loss of @entity46 was a profound psychological shock as well as a military blow to the @entity11			1
@entity32 , originally a strong proponent of the ten year rule , had to deal with its consequences as wartime prime minister			0
any sound grand strategy must account for economic , political and military factors			2
but the strategy ca n't substitute hope for fact			2
the @entity22 hoped they could focus on their economy in the 1920s with a rule based on the assumption that their security would not be threatened during the next decade			0
they thought they could undertake whatever military expansion program necessary if a threat were to manifest			0
in short , the government hoped world events would unfold benignly until the @entity22 economy rebounded			2
instead , the economy worsened as part of a global depression			0
military dictatorships emerged in response to turbulent times and soon threatened @entity22 security			0
by the mid- 1930s , it was evident that by focusing solely on a hopeful strategy , the @entity11 had , much to their regret , failed to create a less optimistic @entity118 as @entity2 embarks on a tough strategic journey in the aftermath of @entity122 , and contends with an ailing economy , it is wise to be mindful of the difference between hope and fact			1
the president and @entity128 might focus on strengthening the economy and assume for a time that a smaller military will suffice			0
pursuing prudent military reductions in this environment makes sense ; however , relying on a budget - driven process to make these reductions does not			2
the nation 's leadership needs a @entity139 so that a heroic assumption -- or hope -- about the unlikelihood of future wars does not inadvertently lead to strategic disaster			0
this is harder than it seems			0
@entity139 would allow more flexibility to meet what could go wrong in the strategic environment rather than just making budget cuts			1
in tough economic times , hope makes planning easier and defense reductions more palatable			0
indeed , the mistake is an easy one to make			0
after all , @entity32 , perhaps the greatest democratic leader of the 20th century , succumbed to the temptation			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			1

@entity159 : with super committee failure , automatic cuts could lead to harsh defense cuts
she says @entity2 could repeat mistake made by @entity11 in cutting defense after @entity15
*arbitrary* budget cuts could leave @entity2 at risk in a dangerous world , she says
@entity173 : a new strategy is needed to determine how to manage the budget
