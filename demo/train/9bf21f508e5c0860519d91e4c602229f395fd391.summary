@entity0 -- from his @entity3 , @entity2 could n't stop clicking his camera			1
endless stretches of windswept sand clashed with the vibrant blues , reds and yellows of the billowing dresses of the women			0
@entity2 , the general counsel for the humanitarian agency @entity12 , felt he was riding through pages of @entity14			1
the harshness of the terrain and its cruel consequences for the people of the @entity19 became apparent when @entity2 stopped and visited villages with a @entity12 delegation			1
he saw women walking three miles with pails to fetch water , diamond droplets in the drought - stricken land			0
in the @entity19 , a region that runs south of the @entity31 across @entity32 from the @entity33 to the @entity34 , people are gaunt from eating just one meal a day , most of the time , millet			1
they are suffering from severe malnutrition and heading towards famine , the @entity36 fears			1
@entity2 has seen poverty before -- in 1989 , he helped found hands on @entity0 , which grew to become one of the world 's largest community based volunteer organizations with more than half a million volunteers			1
but he 'd never seen anything as abject as he did in @entity49			1
on a five - hour drive from the capital , @entity52 , to the town of @entity54 , @entity2 listened to the audiobook , " @entity56 , " a novel that opens with the bleakness of a post-apocalyptic town called @entity60			1
@entity49 felt like @entity60 on steroids			1
" i 'd seen the poorest parts of @entity0 and it was stark , " @entity2 says , back in his fifth floor office at @entity12			1
" but the starkness in @entity49 does n't compare			1
" the needy in @entity0 had solid housing			1
in @entity49 , there was nothing			1
the @entity76 nation of 17 million people ranks second to last on a @entity78			2
@entity2 took the job with @entity12 about a year ago , after almost 11 years as @entity81 's general counsel			1
a whole other world opened up for a man who 'd made a successful living as a lawyer in @entity0			1
at @entity12 , @entity2 deals with employment to taxes to regulatory issues in the myriad nations where the agency works			1
he 's traveled to @entity91 and the @entity76 nations of @entity93 and @entity94 , before the coup in march			2
" it 's one thing to be a tourist , but another to be with an @entity100 , " he says , using the commonly used acronym for a non-governmental organization			2
@entity12 has been working in @entity49 since 1974 , when it first responded to famine			1
people there lead hardscrabble lives in the arid , landlocked nation where only 42 percent of the population have access to safe drinking water and only 15 % of women can read or write			2
@entity49 is the worst country on earth in which to be a mother , according to a report by @entity114			1
the charity 's annual @entity115 uses statistics covering female and child health and nutrition , as well as prospects for women 's education , economic prosperity and political participation in its assessment of 165 countries			2
@entity12 has been running several programs helping villagers to stand up on their own			1
many focus on empowering women and girls through education and microlending			0
this year , life has been even tougher			0
" @entity49 is again facing a crisis of a failed harvest because last season the rains did not come , " says @entity135 , executive director of the @entity136			2
" because the rains failed last season , what you 're seeing is that the hungry poor , the most vulnerable populations , are now at the point where they have depleted their assets			0
and as a result , they have no food			0
" the food shortages are further aggravated by thousands of refugees fleeing fighting in northern @entity94			0
more than 15 million people face hunger and starvation across the @entity19 this year ; 4 million in @entity49 , says the @entity136			1
the thing about the @entity19 , says @entity2 , is that the crisis does n't seem dire to people watching from afar			1
it 's unlike the @entity32 food emergency , where women from @entity161 walked 100 miles carrying children to reach a refugee camp in @entity164			0
or where children were skull and bones with distended bellies			0
where starving people died in front of cameras			0
" the @entity19 has n't reached that point but it 's moving in that direction , " @entity2 says			1
" it 's a slow train wreck in motion			0
" here 's the other thing , he says			0
if people donated small amounts of money now , there would not be a need for millions later to save lives			0
villagers thanked @entity2 and his colleagues for @entity12 's work in helping them with wells and plant gardens so they could grow vegetables instead of eating only grains every day			1
they spoke about the hunger in their bellies as matter - of - factly as an @entity198 would describe an ordinary day at work			0
in one of the villages , as @entity2 saw dozens of children crowd behind the @entity3			1
the tail gate was open and the driver was standing by a cooler containing leftover drinks from lunch earlier			0
" @entity212 , this is the face of poverty , " said @entity2 's colleague , @entity209 , director of @entity210			1
@entity2 thought @entity209 was overreacting			2
it was more than 100 degrees that day			0
who would n't clamor for a cold drink ? then , he says , he took a closer look			0
the cooler was shut tight			0
the driver was not handing out drinks but empty cans and plastic bottles			0
the cans would turn into toy cars and planes ; the bottles , receptacles for precious drops when the rains finally come months from now			0
" our trash was their treasure , " @entity2 says			2
in @entity198 , it 's a good deed to recycle			0
in @entity49 , it was a gift			2
this was the face of poverty in the @entity19			1
it was a jolting lesson for @entity2			2
@entity2 looks out the wall - to - wall windows in his office			2
above , he sees clear , blue skies			0
in front of him , dormitory buildings of @entity246 , architecturally dull and painted in drab colors			0
yet , @entity2 no longer sees them as unattractive			2
across from his office , @entity251 , a senior executive assistant , finishes a meager lunch of half a cup of black beans and a smidgen of frozen broccoli , every morsel cleaned off the bowl			0
all week , she has been surviving on $ 1.50 of food a day in a campaign aimed to help people understand what extreme poverty feels like			2
@entity251 says she has little energy			0
" last night i was so tired i did n't even eat dinner , " she says , adding that she could not imagine having to walk for miles for water , especially in her weakened state			0
@entity2 says it 's the kind of insight that he hopes will help bridge what the @entity36 calls an alarming lack of donations for the @entity19 food crisis , especially because @entity49 is rarely on the evening news			1
he says it 's hard for people , understandably , to fathom the scope of the crisis from far away			2
he is glad he was able to see the situation firsthand			0
it 's been several weeks since @entity2 returned home from what he called a profound trip			1
he 's still unpacking , he says			0
he does n't mean his suitcase .			0

@entity2 launched hands on @entity0 in 1989 and had seen poverty before
but @entity49 's suffering was shocking
the @entity12 lawyer visited *parched* villages where people are going hungry
the @entity36 fears the @entity19 region is moving towards famine
