the @entity0 is stretched " beyond its limits " and needs more training , more staff and a director from outside its ranks -- and the @entity6 needs a better fence -- an independent review has found			1
an eight - page executive summary of the report , produced by a panel of four outside experts appointed by the @entity14 , was released thursday			0
the report said the congressional budget process has left @entity0 directors guessing how much more they might be able to squeeze out of appropriators each year and building their plans around that -- without looking at " how much the mission , done right , actually costs			2
" it said the @entity0 likely needs a funding bump , and that its handling of its budgetary process has led to fewer and fewer hours for training			2
the average special agent on the president 's protective detail received just 42 hours of training in 2013 , while its @entity31 officers got an average of just about 25 minutes of training each , the report said			0
" providing more time for training requires increased staffing , but the @entity0 needs more agents and officers even beyond the levels required to allow for in - service training , " the report said			1
" the president and other protectees can not receive the best possible protection when agents and officers are deployed for longer and longer hours with fewer and fewer days off			0
" @entity47 director testifies on agency 's failures the @entity6 also needs a new fence , the panel said			1
it recommended that the 7.5 - foot fence be at least four or five feet taller , without horizontal bars that make for easy hand and footholds and with its top curved outward			1
" any of these adjustments , the panel is certain , can be made without diminishing the aesthetic beauty or historic character of the @entity6 grounds , " the report said			2
more important , the panel said , is the @entity0 's leadership			0
it recommended that the director " come from outside the service " who is " removed from organizational traditions and personal relationships " can make the kind of top - to - bottom overhaul of the group that the panel said is necessary			1
opinion : do we want a fortress @entity6 ? the panel said it heard from both the 50 @entity0 members and 120 outside officials it interviewed that the service is too " insular " today			1
" from agents to officers to supervisors , we heard a common desire : more resources would help , but what we really need is leadership , " the report said			0
homeland security secretary @entity86 had tapped the panel to conduct a broad review of the @entity0 after a sept. 19 incident in which a man climbed the fence , ran across the north lawn and ran into the @entity6 before agents stopped him			1
the review was conducted by @entity95 , a former associate attorney general ; @entity96 , a former deputy attorney general ; @entity97 , a former cabinet affairs secretary ; and @entity99 , the former @entity6 deputy chief of staff for operations			1
how the @entity0 could beef up @entity6 security @entity86 called the panel 's recommendations -- detailed in an executive summary made public on thursday -- " astute , thorough and fair			2
" " it is now up to the leadership of the @entity0 and the @entity14 to ensure that all the recommendations are carefully considered , " @entity86 said in a statement			0
" in fact , some of the panel 's recommendations are similar to others made in past agency reviews , many of which were never implemented , " he said			0
" this time must be different			0

an independent review of the @entity0 has found that it needs more training and more staff
the review said the service is too insular and needs a director from outside its ranks
it also recommended a taller @entity6 fence , with its top curved outward
