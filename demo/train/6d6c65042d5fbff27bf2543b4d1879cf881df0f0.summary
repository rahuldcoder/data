-- what happens when the @entity3 party leaves town ? it 's a question that is probably giving organizers of the @entity8 sleepless nights and , if the example of @entity10 is anything to go by , some food for thought			1
will all the expense be worthwhile ? @entity15 is spending an unprecedented $ 50 billion on completely revamping its faded @entity17 resort , hoping to turn it into a tourist mecca and hi - tech business destination for decades after next february 's 16 days of competition			1
can @entity23 's grand planners learn from one of the smallest host venues in @entity3 history ? leap of faith as @entity29 prepared to make the historic leap at the opening ceremony of the 1994 @entity3 , he carried with him not just the symbolic torch but also the hopes of the @entity35 nation			1
he was drafted in 48 hours earlier after @entity36 was injured during practice , and his ski jump was to be the dramatic denouement to the @entity3 flame 's 7,500 - mile journey from @entity42			1
following the theft of @entity46 's " @entity45 " from @entity35 's @entity47 in @entity48 earlier that february day , @entity10 's organizers could have been forgiven for wearing their own looks of anguished despair as @entity29 started his descent			1
but they need n't have worried			0
the 26 - year - old understudy landed safely in the @entity53 before handing on the torch on for its final earthbound journey to the @entity3 cauldron			1
while @entity10 ' 94 is perhaps best known for the sad soap opera that played out between @entity60 figure skaters @entity58 and @entity61 , @entity35 remember a far happier time , when a small town of 23,500 residents became the center of the sporting universe			1
party atmosphere " it was a party for the @entity35 people , " recalls @entity68 , secretary general of the @entity69			2
" it brought people together , there was a lot of pride and there was also lovely winter conditions			0
so it was , in one way , a great promotion for the country			0
" this celebratory atmosphere helped push the country 's athletes to new heights			0
speed skater @entity88 led the way with three golds ( and three world records ) as @entity35 bagged a record 26 medals ( 10 gold , 11 silver , five bronze )			2
but six years earlier , the idea of @entity10 playing host to such scenes was almost impossible to imagine			1
@entity35 had endured its worst @entity3 for more than three decades at @entity100 in 1988 , picking up just three silver and two bronze			1
and after finishing fourth in the bid to host the @entity104 ( won by @entity105 , @entity106 ) , @entity10 was considered a rank outsider in the race to host the ' 94 games -- the first time winter and summer olympics were held in different years			1
but to everyone 's amazement , @entity10 beat @entity115 's @entity114 -- population 60,000 -- in the final round of voting , setting in motion the task of turning a remote town 110 miles north of @entity48 into a center of sporting excellence			1
" there was really nothing there , " @entity68 told @entity0			0
" there were no big venues before the @entity3			2
it was a huge gift to this part of @entity35			2
" around 680 million @entity131 ( $ 220 million ) of the 12 billion nok ( $ 2 billion ) total budget was spent transforming the @entity10 landscape			1
new venues were built for ski jumping , ice hockey , bobsleigh / luge along with freestyle and cross-country ski stadiums			0
additional arenas were sited in neighboring towns @entity142 and @entity143 and two new ski resorts were built north of the @entity10 in @entity145 and @entity146			2
" @entity10 is now the natural choice for top athletes and national teams			2
it has probably become the strongest sports region in the country , " says @entity68			0
the 16 - day event is also remembered as the first " green " games , enshrining the now familiar ethos of conservation and sustainability at big sporting events			0
perhaps the most visible and enduring reminder were the @entity3 medals themselves , which were partly made from stone extracted during construction of the ski jumping arena			1
a different type of recycling was used when the @entity167 international media center was refurbished and handed over to @entity168 in 1995			0
today , the campus has more than 4,000 students and , since 1997 , has been home to the @entity172			0
@entity3 tourist trap while an educational legacy may be secure , the economic aspirations of boosting tourism in the region proved harder to realize			1
part of the idea of staging the @entity3 in @entity10 was to provide investment in inland @entity35 , @entity68 says , bringing it up to a level with the successful oil and fish industries on the west coast and in the north of the country			1
it worked in as much that it encouraged ( and still does ) affluent city dwellers in @entity48 and other southern cities to build luxury second homes near the sports facilities			0
but the goal of encouraging more @entity35 and foreign tourists to the wider region have largely failed , says @entity196 , a @entity35 social scientist who has studied the economic after - effects of the @entity198			2
" the predictions on a regional level was that tourist demand would increase more than 100 %			0
local scientists predicted annual increases of 15 % over a long period			0
the reality is zero outside all four communities that got @entity3 sports facilities , " says @entity196			2
@entity35 did experience a rise in foreign tourists before the @entity3 and for two years after , says @entity196 , but this was largely down to increased numbers from eastern @entity211 ( particularly @entity212 ) following the fall of communism in 1989 and subsequent years			1
but long - term predictions ( 10 % per year for the decade after the @entity8 ) for tourist growth nationally never happened			0
@entity10 and the other @entity3 resorts did n't emerge completely unscathed			1
in the five years following the @entity8 , 40 % of the town 's hotels went bankrupt , says @entity196			0
and while cross-country events are incredibly popular , the alpine resorts of @entity221 and @entity145 north of @entity10 remain economically fragile , he says			2
@entity35 's experience is n't unique			1
most , if not all of the last eight host countries of @entity3 have experienced negligible increases in tourist numbers , says @entity196			1
it 's something that organizers of the next " small town " olympics at @entity231 , @entity232 in 2018 should bear in mind			2
" they should be very careful about developing a lot of accommodation facilities if they have not seen strong growth in winter sports already , " @entity196 says			0
the $ 50 billion question ? of course , before @entity231 comes @entity242 2014			2
@entity15 's great winter sports showpiece will be the most expensive @entity3 ( winter or summer ) in history and five times more expensive than its original budget			2
@entity10 also overshot its original costs by a similar multiple			0
it 's hard to see how hosting an @entity3 can ever add up financially , but it appears you ca n't put a price on the experience of hosting			1
" @entity10 was well organized			0
it really was a huge party			0
was it worth $ 2 billion or not ? it seems like a lot of @entity35 think that it was , " @entity196 says			1
" here in @entity35 , i have never heard people say it was not worth it , " he said			0
" everything in @entity10 got a lift			0
it was n't just an investment in the sports venues , it was an investment in the town itself and also the rail and road links from @entity48			1
" @entity35 have much to cheer about when it comes to medals too			0
since 1994 , the homeland of @entity272 -- the man who invented recreational skiing in the 19th century -- has collected a further 92 @entity3 medals ( including 34 gold ) , and finished top of the table at @entity279 in 2002 with 13 golds and 25 in total			1
thanks to the @entity284 series " @entity286 , " tv viewers worldwide are getting to know the town all over again and in a little over two years , @entity10 will welcome back a new generation of athletes for the @entity290			1
" we are building a new knowledge for young leaders and coaches here in @entity35 , " @entity68 says			0
" i believe that will be our big gift for the next generation			0

small @entity35 town rose to sporting *prominence* at 1994 @entity3
investment in @entity10 has made it a *post-olympic* center of sporting excellence
$ *1.2* billion of public money gave boost to town but did n't increase tourism as expected
@entity10 set to host second @entity312 in 2016
