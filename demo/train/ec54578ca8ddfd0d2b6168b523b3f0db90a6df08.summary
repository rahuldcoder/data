-- former @entity2 gov. @entity1 on tuesday said he accepts " full responsibility " for granting clemency in 2000 to a man authorities say gunned down four @entity4 , @entity5 , police officers sunday			1
@entity9 , 37 , was shot and killed early tuesday by @entity11 police			0
he was the subject of a two - day manhunt after the four officers were killed at a coffee shop as they met before their shifts began sunday morning			1
@entity9 had a criminal history in @entity2 and @entity5			1
in may 2000 , @entity1 commuted his 108 - year prison sentence to make him immediately eligible for parole , which was granted by the parole board two months later			1
@entity9 had been sentenced to 95 years , to run after time he was already serving on previous convictions			0
in a statement on the conservative news web site newsmax.com , @entity1 wrote that he commuted @entity9 ' sentence from 108 years to 47 years			1
reports that he had pardoned @entity9 or set him free were erroneous , he said			0
" i take full responsibility for my actions of nine years ago , " @entity1 said			1
" i acted on the facts presented to me in 2000			1
if i could have possibly known what @entity9 would do nine years later , i obviously would have made a different decision			0
but if the same file was presented to me today , i would have likely made the same decision			2
" but the @entity2 prosecutor who put @entity9 behind bars told @entity0 on tuesday that @entity1 was issuing clemency at " an astounding rate " during his tenure as governor			1
" he was exercising the clemency power at what i call a wholesale rate , " @entity39 said			2
" he was letting murderers out , he was letting rapists out , and he was letting the likes of mr. @entity9 out			0
" one survey , he said , showed @entity1 issued more clemencies from 1996 to 2004 than the governors of all six surrounding states , including @entity50			1
he said he did n't know why so many clemencies were granted			0
" that was part of the frustration that we felt with the entire process			0
... we never felt as though he gave victims , their families , jurors , law enforcement and the community in general an adequate explanation as to why he felt compelled to let people of proven danger go in our community			0
" @entity1 was a @entity68 presidential candidate in the 2008 election and has not ruled out another @entity71 bid in 2012			2
during his 2008 campaign , he was criticized for granting clemency to another inmate , convicted rapist @entity75 , who was later convicted of raping and murdering a woman in @entity78			2
" between 1,000 and 2,000 requests for some form of clemency came to my desk each and every one of the 10Â½ years i was governor , " @entity1 said tuesday			1
" ninety - two percent of the time , i denied the requests			1
" he noted that in @entity2 , a governor does not initiate a sentence change -- the @entity86 makes a recommendation to the governor after reviewing an inmate 's file			2
the governor then can grant or deny it			0
@entity9 was 16 when he was charged with robbery and burglary			0
" for the crimes he committed and the age at which he committed the crimes , [ a 108 - year sentence ] was dramatically outside the norm for sentencing , " @entity1 said			1
the board unanimously recommended that the sentence be commuted			2
@entity39 said that while in prison in @entity2 , @entity9 had a disciplinary record for violent incidents , and that something should have tipped off the board or the governor that " this man was not a good candidate to be put back in society , because he could n't live in the cloistered environment of prison and stay out of trouble			1
" watch what @entity39 has to say in the case of any form of clemency -- a commutation or a full pardon -- notice is given to the prosecutor , the judge , law enforcement officials , the attorney general and the secretary of state , as well as the media , for a public response period , @entity1 said			1
" the only record of public response to the notice to commute was from the trial judge , who recommended the commendation in concert with the board			0
" @entity39 told @entity0 he was not notified of the commutation , but he does n't " attribute that to something sinister			0
... i just think that maybe the system fouled up and did n't get notification out to all the parties who were interested in it , my office included			0
" @entity9 was returned to prison after violating his parole , @entity1 said			1
he " should have stayed there			0
for reasons only the prosecutor can explain , charges were not brought forth in a timely way and the prosecutor ended up dropping the charges , allowing him to leave prison and return to supervised parole			2
" he noted that @entity9 , who had been picked up again in @entity157 , @entity5 , was released on bail there only days before the officers were slain			1
" i ca n't explain why he was n't prosecuted properly for the parole violations or why he was allowed to make bail in @entity5 and not incarcerated earlier for crimes committed there , " the former governor wrote			1
on sunday , @entity1 's office issued a statement saying that if @entity9 was " found responsible for this horrible tragedy , it will be the result of a series of failures in the criminal justice system in both @entity2 and @entity5			1
" police responded sharply to that statement			0
" we 're disappointed that governor @entity1 came out in the middle of the night without calling anybody here and blamed this on the criminal justice system in the state of @entity5 , " @entity173 spokesman @entity172 said			1
" we 're guessing that 's probably a spin doctor , not him			0
" @entity1 wrote of @entity9 , " i wish his file had never crossed my desk , but it did			2
the decision i made is one that i now wish were different , but i could only look backwards at his case , not forward			0
none of this is of any comfort to the families of these police officers , nor should it be			0
... our system is not perfect , and neither are those responsible for administering it			0
" the system , and those of us who are supposed to make sure it works , sometimes fail , " @entity1 said			2
" in this case , we clearly did			0
