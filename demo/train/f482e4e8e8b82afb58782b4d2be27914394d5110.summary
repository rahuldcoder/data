-- we remember @entity2 as the automotive magnate who perfected assembly line technology , but he also dabbled in ambitious social programs , including one in which he hired ex-convicts straight out of @entity9 to staff his factories			1
@entity2 , pictured in 1942 , unsuccessfully attempted to increase the rubber supply with a plantation in @entity13			1
although many of these efforts were successful , @entity15 's ill - fated foray into the @entity13 jungle was a notable and fascinating exception			2
the plan if you 're going to make millions of cars , you 're going to need an awful lot of rubber			0
in 1927 , @entity15 came up with a novel plan : he 'd solve his rubber problem and test out his lofty theories about social planning			0
if everything went well , he could craft both a utopia full of healthy , productive workers and a direct pipeline of coveted rubber to @entity35			2
@entity15 approached the task with characteristic zeal			0
he talked the @entity13 government into granting him 10,000 square kilometers of land in the @entity41 rain forest -- a plot that was nearly twice as big as the state of @entity44 -- in exchange for a 9 percent cut of the plantation 's profits			1
in theory , this setup seemed like one of @entity15 's ideas that would shake out pretty well , and in 1928 , @entity15 sent a barge full of supplies from @entity55 down to his new plantation town , which was dubbed " @entity57			0
" growing rubber in the jungle unfortunately for @entity15 's stockholders , though , the captain of industry did n't always have a great eye for detail			1
( one famous story about @entity15 was that he disliked accountants so fiercely that he never had his company audited			0
by the end of his tenure , the @entity15 allegedly had no idea exactly how much it cost to build a car			0
) @entity15 did n't check to see if the plantation was suitable for growing rubber			1
according to @entity75 , author of " @entity57 : the @entity84 of @entity2 's @entity85 , " @entity2 never consulted any sort of expert on rubber cultivation ; he just sent a bunch of supplies and managers into the jungle hoping to grow some rubber			2
@entity0 : @entity2 and others who survived bankruptcy @entity15 was legendarily contemptuous of experts , but he could have saved some serious dough if he 'd just hired a consultant to tell him that the plantation was n't at all suitable for growing rubber			1
the land was n't very fertile , but that was n't the main problem			2
the real difficulty was that it 's practically impossible to farm rubber in a plantation setting in the @entity41 rainforest			1
to grow the trees on a commercial scale , you 've got to pack them in fairly close together , and at that point they become incredibly susceptible to blight and insect attacks			0
@entity57 's trees were no exception , and caterpillars and blight quickly decimated the fields			0
not exactly a worker 's paradise obviously , the rubber production part of the @entity57 got off to a rocky start			0
how was the " worker 's paradise " part of things going , though ? even more abysmally			0
the @entity121 managers and their families that @entity15 imported from @entity55 were n't accustomed to the sweltering @entity13 heat and headed back north with an alarming frequency			1
the heavy machinery used on the plantation left deep ruts in the soft soil , which collected stagnant water and became breeding grounds for malaria - ridden mosquitoes			2
@entity2 had attempted to design @entity57 like any @entity121 town , complete with schools , restaurants , a golf course , and shops			2
the catch here , though , was that the indigenous @entity13 who farmed the rubber were n't used to living in a stylized @entity121 community			1
worse still , the plantation 's workers were expected to work a strict shift from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. , whereas normal harvesting practices in the region saw workers hit the fields before dawn , take a long break , and then head out again at twilight to save themselves the misery of working in the tropical midday heat			0
food fights @entity15 's influence extended all the way down to the residents ' diets , and while the indigenous workers were n't crazy about having to eat @entity121 foods , they were livid about having to eat in a cafeteria setting rather than enjoying the homestyle meals to which they were accustomed			2
eventually , the workers decided they 'd had enough of the affront of cafeteria dining and rioted during a meal			0
@entity0 : three historical food fights as the @entity121 managers fled to the safety of boats , the workers destroyed their mess hall and continued to riot until @entity13 soldiers came in to suppress violence			1
another sticking point for the workers was @entity15 's insistence that his model community be entirely free of alcohol and tobacco			0
although @entity181 was n't exactly an unqualified success at home , and although alcohol was still legal in @entity13 , @entity15 stayed firm on his booze ban			1
workers who needed a drink were forced just outside the city limits to buy a bottle of cachaca ; enterprising liquor salesman could simply paddle by on the river and unload their wares			0
@entity0 : why is the drinking age 21 ? end of the road eventually , even though @entity2 steadfastly insisted that the community could thrive and help introduce @entity121 - style industrialization to the rest of the world , it became abundantly clear that the noble @entity57 experiment was a flop			1
after the perfection of synthetic rubber in 1945 , @entity15 sold the plantation at a $ 20 million loss and left @entity13			1
just how much of a fiasco was the @entity57 experiment ? although @entity2 spent 17 years trying to produce rubber on the plantation , no @entity15 car ever rolled off the assembly line with a single bit of @entity57 's rubber in it			1

the auto magnate set up a plantation in the @entity41 rain forest to produce rubber
he did n't *research* the land and found out to late it was n't suitable for growing rubber
@entity13 workers rioted against @entity121 - style mess hall , ban on alcohol
@entity2 *ultimately* sold the plantation at a $ 20 million loss
