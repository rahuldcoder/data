-- after 60 years of waiting , @entity1 may very well find themselves with a strong , assertive @entity2			1
on monday and tuesday , millions of @entity1 spent hours in long , looping lines , waiting to cast ballots in the country 's first elections since the fall of president @entity8			2
the two days of voting felt like a success , particularly because in the days leading up to the vote , @entity1 seemed on the verge of implosion			1
street battles in @entity15 had claimed more than 40 lives , as police used brute force in an attempt to subdue protesters			0
there was talk of postponing the vote			0
but elections were held as scheduled , and , surprisingly , there was neither major violence nor reports of systematic fraud or irregularities			0
why , then , does the optimism that @entity1 have every right to feel remain tenuous ? part of the attraction of voting is the release that comes from knowing who won			2
here , though , delayed gratification is the order of the day			0
@entity1 has an odd , three - round voting system , so @entity1 wo n't know the official outcome until january			1
( preliminary results , though , appear to show the @entity42 with a commanding lead			2
) more problematic , though , is the confusion surrounding the role of @entity2			2
the ruling military council is hoping for a weak @entity2 ; @entity1 's political parties , however , may have other plans			1
during political transitions , institutional roles often remain undefined and fluid , shaped by the decisions of the individuals and parties themselves			0
a strong @entity2 depends on a critical mass of parliamentarians who believe in -- and fight for -- their institution 's power			1
because @entity1 is still operating under a presidential system , with the ruling military council as the executive authority , @entity2 will not be able to form a government			1
but it will likely be able to withhold confidence from the @entity65 , oversee the budget , and pass legislation			0
most importantly , the @entity2 will appoint a committee to draft a new constitution			0
this constitution will determine the balance of powers between the executive branch and legislative branches			0
the @entity42 's @entity74 -- which will control a sizable plurality of seats -- supports a pure parliamentary system , with either a ceremonial president or no president at all			1
some of the @entity42 's critics see this as a relatively transparent power grab , which it may , in fact , be			1
at the same time , with the real risk of a military - approved candidate winning free presidential elections , a mixed system with a powerful president comes with its own pitfalls			1
the real battle for @entity1 may no longer be on the streets of @entity92 but , rather , within its institutions			1
this new phase will be defined by a precarious balancing act between different power centers , each with its own distinct sources of legitimacy			0
the military will continue to call on its history as " protector of the nation " and , now , " protector of the revolution			0
" but the @entity2 will be the only nationally elected body that can claim to represent the will of the people			1
if the turnout figures are indeed high , as preliminary reports indicate , then the @entity2 can claim an even stronger popular mandate			2
this struggle for power will be just as meaningful -- and likely much more contentious -- than the elections that preceded it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity118 .			0

@entity118 : @entity1 election seems a success despite street protests the week before
he says real problem looms when elected @entity2 and military council *vie* for power
he says @entity42 wants pure parliamentary system ; this comes with pitfalls
@entity118 : military wants to hold on to power , but @entity2 *reflects* will of people , mandate
