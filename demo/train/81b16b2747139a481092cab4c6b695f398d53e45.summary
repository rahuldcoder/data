as electronic cigarettes increase in popularity , calls to the nation 's poison control centers about exposure to the liquid nicotine used in many of the devices have surged , the @entity0 said thursday			1
in february , there were 215 poison center calls involving e-cigarettes , the @entity0 said in its @entity12			1
that 's compared to one per month in september 2010			2
and 51 % of those calls involved children 5 and under , officials said			1
since not all poisonings get reported , the @entity0 said the total number of cases is likely even higher			1
nicotine is a drug , and in its concentrated liquid form , poison experts warn it is also significantly toxic , even in small doses			1
e-cigarettes , which are not required to be childproof , feature flavors like spearmint , banana and bubble gum , making them appealing to kids			1
" what 's attractive to kids : it 's the smell			2
it 's the color , " said @entity35 , director of the @entity36			2
" a kid 's not going to know the difference between a poison and something they can drink			1
" an @entity44 mother found that out the hard way when her 4 - year - old son got his hands on the liquid nicotine used to refill her e-cigarettes			1
" we hear a little noise , come in and he has taken the lid off of all of them and has this liquid everywhere			2
he 's got it all over him			0
he 's been eating it , " @entity57 told @entity60 affiliate @entity58			0
her son was rushed to the emergency room and vomited all day long			0
e-cigarettes : healthy tool or gateway device ? poisonings can also occur when liquid nicotine is inhaled or absorbed through the skin or eyes , and other side effects can include nausea and eye irritation			1
it can even be deadly			0
one person used the liquid to commit suicide by injecting it , according to the @entity0			1
@entity35 said his poison center has also taken calls from adults who 've spilled e-cigarette nicotine on themselves while filling up the devices			1
" you can start to feel sick in as little as four to five minutes , " he said			0
" the fumes themselves can be poisonous , and if we inhale them for long enough we 're going to get a little sick to our stomach			0
" about 42 % of the poison calls in february involved people age 20 and older , the @entity0 said			1
e-cigarette products are currently not regulated by the @entity93			0
poison control experts say the liquids , found in bottles or cartridges that have been known to break , need to be better controlled			1
" there 's no legislation on the books right now , " @entity35 said			0
" a product as dangerous as this , as lethal as this , child - resistant caps would be a great help			0
" @entity106 , founder of the @entity107 , said his association promotes childproof packaging , warning labels , and limits on the potency of liquid nicotine sold in bottles			1
" we have expressed our concerns about unregulated liquids on many occasions , but we do not want to demonize them as the culprit for this problem , " @entity106 said in a statement			0
" the toxicity for all products is in the dosage			0
" " we have provided the regulatory bodies information and guidelines on this that can easily be implemented and then could eliminate these cases entirely			0
" educating e-cigarette users is also a crucial step in eliminating the incidents , he said			0
" responsibly marketed and properly regulated , it is possible that e-cigarettes could benefit public health if they help significantly reduce the number of people who use conventional cigarettes and die of tobacco - related disease , " said @entity134 , president of @entity135 , in a statement			2
" but in the absence of @entity93 oversight , the easy availability of nicotine in uncontrolled quantities , packaging and flavors and marketing that appeals to youth raises serious concerns			2
" @entity57 , the mother in @entity44 , said she has since moved her liquid nicotine up and out of her son 's reach			1
" it smells like candy			0
it really is n't , " she told @entity58			0
" this really can hurt you			0
" opinion : @entity93 oversight of e-cigarettes overdue			2

more than half of february calls involved young children
liquid nicotine poisoning can occur from *ingestion* , inhalation or skin absorption
