-- the world of golf is eager to know when @entity3 will return to action after back surgery , yet not even the man himself can set a date			1
woods was forced to pull out of the masters for the first time last month after undergoing an operation on march 31 -- having struggled for several weeks with a pinched nerve in his back -- and he has been sidelined ever since			1
the surgery was successfully performed in @entity17 by neurosurgeon dr @entity18 , with the world no. 1 being told he needed time to rest and rehabilitate			1
but while the recovery time from such an operation is usually three to four months , @entity3 remains clueless as to when he will next tee off on a golf course			1
" as i 've said several times , i hope to be back sometime this summer , but i just do n't know when , " he wrote on his official website			1
" i 'm doing everything i can and listening to my doctors and working on a strength program , and then we just have to see how my back is			1
" some people heal up in three months , some people take four months , some people take longer			0
i just do n't know			0
" woods , who has begun cycling and swimming as he builds up his strength and fitness , had been struggling since last year with the back injury , which severely hampered his game in the opening months of 2014 leading up to the masters			1
in march , the condition forced him to stop playing after 13 holes of his final round at the @entity49			0
when he tried to return to action the following week at the @entity51 in @entity52 , he aggravated the injury			2
and he then withdrew from the @entity54 , explaining that neither the back spasms nor pain had subsided			2
" i made the decision to have surgery because physically i just could n't make a golf swing			1
that pretty much sums it up , " said the @entity60			0
" once i begin swinging a club again , i 'm not sure if i will have to make any changes to protect my back			1
" he added : " we have to make sure my back heals fine and i have the strength and mobility going forward			1
" had @entity34 been fit , he would be preparing to defend his title at the @entity70 in @entity71 this week , with the event getting underway thursday			0
while he is frustrated to be missing out on the action , the 14 - time major winner is at least encouraged by the slow - but - sure progress he is making			2
" my recovery from microdiscectomy surgery for a pinched nerve in my back is coming along , but it 's a very slow process , " added @entity3			1
" i 'm still sore			0
not from the procedure itself but the incision			0
i just need to get back to my day - to - day activities , and that 's it			1
" one reassuring thing from my medical exam is i have zero arthritic changes whatsoever			0
i 've kept myself in very good shape over the years , and it has paid off			0
" we knew going into this procedure that it really helps to be strong , especially in my glutes and my abs. i was strong in both departments , and that helps with the recovery and rehab , and you 're able to come back faster			2
" @entity34 has been in a similar situation before , having had to undergo surgery on his knee in 2008 , while he has also struggled with an @entity104 problem in the past			2
the 38 - year - old is able to seek solace from such experiences on his road to recovery , and in turn allow himself to plan for an eventful second half of the 2014 season			1
" it 's a building process , just like when i came back from my knee and @entity104 injuries			2
you start from the green and work your way back : putting , chipping , pitching , wedging , mid-irons , long irons , woods and eventually playing			0
that 's all a process and takes time , " he said ,			0
" there 's the @entity125 [ to look forward to ] and the @entity126 , and of the course the @entity127 is about six weeks away			0
you can understand why i want to hurry up and get better			0
i 'd also like to play in the @entity129 and the @entity130			0

@entity3 *unsure* when he will return from back surgery
the 38 - year - old is hoping to be back sometime in the summer
he underwent surgery as he was unable to make a golf swing
