-- @entity2 's @entity1 faced new storms , literally and figuratively , on the first day of his second term as governor with scandal buffeting his administration and now a top conservative @entity8 in @entity9 saying he should abandon a key @entity8 post			1
all of it , punctuated by a major snowstorm that swept through the @entity2 as @entity1 took the oath of office , put new pressure on him as he contemplates a run for president in 2016 and stands atop polls as the @entity8 's leading hope			2
@entity1 did not mention the unfolding scandals in his inauguration speech at the @entity22 in @entity23			2
instead he praised how his state came together in his first four years to meet the challenges of the economic recession and @entity27 , as well as the landslide re-election victory voters gave him last november			2
" this election has taught us that the ways we divide each other -- by race , by class , by ethnicity , by wealth , and yes , by political party -- is neither permanent nor necessary , " he said			0
" our dreams are the same : a good job , a great education for our children , safe streets in our neighborhood and core values which give our lives real meaning			0
" @entity1 's carefully crafted strategy of success built upon reaching across the political aisle to @entity53 is not necessarily a virtue shared by all @entity8 , especially conservatives not yet sold on his credentials to uphold their causes in a national campaign			1
one prominent conservative in @entity9 , former state attorney general and 2013 gubernatorial candidate @entity59 , said @entity1 should step down from his new role as chairman of the @entity62 , seen as a stepping stone to a @entity65 run			1
@entity59 , who lost his race for governor , said the current state legislative investigations into suggested political misconduct by top @entity1 administration appointees would hinder his ability to successfully campaign for @entity8 candidates			1
" i think just from the perspective of setting aside this as an issue in other races , it makes sense for him to step aside in that role , " he said on @entity0 's crossfire on tuesday			0
@entity59 was unhappy with the @entity62 -- which @entity1 did not lead at the time -- for not steering more money to his effort			1
@entity1 defenders speak out however , two @entity8 governors said recently they still support @entity1 in the @entity62 post			2
@entity89 gov. @entity88 , mentioned often as a potential presidential candidate as well , and @entity92 gov. @entity91 said in @entity93 they had confidence in @entity1 's leadership			1
@entity1 has said the uproar in his state would not impact his work on behalf of other governors			2
he was in @entity100 this past weekend to help raise money for incumbent @entity102			0
@entity1 's administration has been rocked by suggestions of political dirty tricks and strong - armed politics that are being investigated by a state legislative committee and the @entity110 attorney 's office			1
the lead scandal , in which investigators want to know if top appointees orchestrated traffic gridlock near the @entity115 last september to politically punish a local mayor , has already cost four top advisers their jobs and spawned numerous subpoenas by a special state assembly committee looking for documents and other materials			0
@entity1 has denied knowledge of the alleged bridge scheme			0
a @entity8 governor in a state dominated by @entity53 , @entity1 distinguished himself from the partisanship in @entity93 by promoting a bipartisan vision for the @entity2			2
his inauguration remarks countered an image some opponents offer about an administration they say takes hardball politics to new levels in a state known for being rough - and - tumble politically			0
@entity1 scandals : what you need to know hours before @entity1 's second inaugural , a top @entity2 @entity8 defended him			1
" he 's a former federal prosecutor , indicted over a hundred politicians			0
he 's the last guy on earth who 's going to do an illegal activity			0
it 's repugnant to him , " said @entity144 , the @entity8 leader in the @entity145 , on @entity0 's @entity146			0
with the next race for the @entity65 on the horizon , and @entity1 said to be considering a bid , he hopes his inaugural message resonates with a national audience			0
however , new national polling indicates his crossover appeal among independents and @entity53 , a rare characteristic that elevates his national standing , has softened			0
@entity0 exclusive : @entity162 job created for @entity1 ally , source says @entity165 mayor provides more evidence aside from the bridge scandal , @entity1 's team faces questions about how the administration handled @entity27 relief money approved by the federal government			1
@entity165 mayor @entity173 this week alleged that @entity1 's administration hung -- or " held hostage " -- storm recovery funds for her town on her support for a redevelopment project proposed by a firm , the @entity180 , with ties to the governor			1
@entity173 said lt. gov. @entity183 delivered the message in a parking lot last may , saying it came directly from @entity1			2
@entity187 denies the allegation ; @entity173 is standing firm , saying she 's already told her story to federal prosecutors			0
state legislative investigators also want to hear from @entity173			0
also on @entity27 , a federal watchdog is looking into how the state used relief money in promoting the state 's recovery from the october 2012 storm that devastated coastal areas			1
the @entity202 inspector general 's office is specifically looking at spending on an ad produced for @entity205 marketing purposes that featured @entity1 and his family			1
@entity1 's office has said the @entity210 administration signed off on its marketing plan and vehemently denies any wrongdoing in the @entity173 matter			1
who is @entity173 ? hot piece of land in @entity165 at center of @entity219 dispute see her journal entries @entity1 marches on as controversy at home unfolds @entity0 's @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229 contributed to this report .			1
