-- back when i was a kid , they were called " whistle - blowers " : employees of corrupt companies or government agencies , who went to the press with shocking stories of criminality or abuse			1
@entity12 risked his life to leak the @entity14 , which destroyed public support for the @entity16			0
@entity19 pellet maker @entity17 was exposing malfeasance at the @entity22 plutonium plant when she was killed in an auto wreck			0
@entity24 exposed @entity26 's practice of intentionally manipulating the effect of nicotine in cigarettes , forcing @entity30 finally to admit the addictiveness of their product			0
since the 1960s , dozens of brave , disillusioned @entity34 such as them have turned against employers who were breaking the law or otherwise harming humanity in some real way			0
they did so at the expense of their careers and sometimes even their lives			0
somehow , the recent spate of similarly public defections of employees from the corporations they work for just does n't feel like quite the same thing			1
sure , it 's pretty easy for most of us to agree with @entity53 , the @entity54 derivatives dealer who quit publicly via a @entity55 because " the environment now is as toxic and destructive as i have ever seen it			2
" still , he 's not complaining that @entity54 is destroying the environment -- as in the air or the water -- through pollution			1
he 's complaining about the corporate environment , the conversation in the corridors and the way the firm is choosing to make money			0
instead of helping its clients make money , @entity53 says , the firm is now -- legally but unscrupulously -- putting its own needs first and fleecing its clients for whatever it can get			2
he is upset about the collapse of the corporate culture , its ability to create value for clients and the sustainability of the enterprise			0
likewise , computer engineer @entity81 , who left @entity82 in 2009 to work at @entity84 , returned to @entity82 last month and fired off an angry public blog post about how @entity84 is losing itself in a " whirlwind of desperation			2
" he says that when he first went to @entity84 , it was " a technology company that empowered its employees to innovate			1
" now , he complains , thanks to its obsession with promoting its @entity96 - like @entity95 service , " the @entity84 i left was an advertising company with a single corporate - mandated focus			1
" these gentlemen are garnering the same sorts of astonished headlines and outcry from their former employers and colleagues as did earlier generations of whistle - blowers			1
and while it may seem like they are turning against their companies , the real difference here is that they see themselves as speaking for their companies			2
these are not conflicts over corporate malfeasance , but over business plans ! @entity53 believes it is not just more ethical , but better business for @entity54 to think about serving its clients			1
he thinks it is a better long - term strategy for @entity54 to help its clients make smart investments , rather than convincing them to make bad investments -- and then bet against those very same clients			1
@entity81 believes @entity84 , the corporation , is turning its back on its greatest assets by focusing on advertising revenues instead of technological innovation			2
" the trappings of entrepreneurship were dismantled , " he explained , " trappings " being a good thing in this context			0
in short , this is not the way he thinks the corporation can succeed			0
unlike whistle - blowers of the 20th century , this new breed of turncoats reveals just how far from questioning the corporate reality we have come			1
they become dissidents not by challenging corporate power , but by challenging their own corporation 's methodology -- as if they would have been better ceos themselves			0
in both cases , they accept the underlying corporate structures and the greater economic operating system in which they function as given circumstances			0
what they can not see from their vantage point is that these companies are behaving in a manner totally consonant with their corporate agendas			2
the minute @entity84 went public , its only priority was to serve its shareholders			2
@entity84 is an advertising company			1
that 's how it makes its revenue			0
any technological innovations that do n't serve this purpose -- and do so quickly -- will be questioned by shareholders and board members looking for big short - term gains			1
likewise , @entity54 is in the moneymaking business			1
they are operating on a fiscal landscape where innovation is no longer valued , and where it 's easier to make money the old - fashioned way ( exploiting people dumber than you are )			0
occupy @entity178 kids figured this out months ago , and a few million mortgage - holders and retirees figured it out a few years ago : when you have to keep growing at the rate of interest to stay alive , you are going to start making stupid short - term decisions			0
in short , the kinds of sustainable , value - creating businesses these corporate escapees are calling for just ca n't happen within a corporate model based on borrowing , leverage and expansion			1
it 's too little and too late for a few corporate whistle - blowers to tell us how the companies they work for are technically incompetent , distracted by revenues or losing the values that once made them great			1
it 's time to blow the whistle on the whole thing			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			2

@entity207 says whistle - blowers used to point out company *misbehavior*
but he says recent company trashings by *ex-employees* were aimed at business plans
he says @entity54 , @entity84 -- both *criticized* recently -- are doing what they exist to do
@entity207 : what the two *ex-workers* want ca n't happen in the companies ' business model
