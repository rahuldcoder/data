but apart from making international trade more expensive , the threat of piracy in one of the world 's most important trade gateways is also an economic blow for neighboring @entity37 countries , particularly in the pillar sectors of tourism and fishing , said the report			1
since 2006 , tourism spending in @entity37 coastal countries has risen 25 % more slowly than other @entity45 nations , mainly because of fewer arrivals from high - income citizens of @entity49 countries			0
piracy in the region is thought to have tarnished its image as a stable holiday destination , with visits to impacted @entity37 coastal nations down by nearly 6.5 % relative to visits to other countries			0
according to the @entity1 , exports of fish products from piracy - hit countries have also suffered , declining by 23.8 % since 2006 , the year the report takes as the starting point of piracy			1
the @entity1 defines piracy - affected countries as @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , the @entity71 , @entity3 , @entity72 , as well as @entity73 , @entity74 and the countries of the @entity76			2

between 82 and 97 casualties are believed to have occurred as a result of these attacks			0
attacks peaked in 2011 , but have declined sharply since , largely because of increased mobilization of international naval forces and tighter security adopted by the shipping industry			0
