-- while state tv bounced between scenes of serene concert footage and orderly rallies in support of leader @entity7 , eyewitnesses describe a far different , far more chaotic @entity8 -- one with arms - toting mercenaries , demonstrators ramming stolen tanks into a military base and masked men firing guns and blasting pro-government tunes from their sport utility vehicles			1
sporadic gunfire continued to ring out early monday in parts of the @entity21 nation , albeit a far cry from the tumult seen at other times since demonstrations and clashes began tuesday night in @entity27			1
obtaining independent confirmation on events in @entity8 is very difficult			0
the @entity8 government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from @entity0 for access to the country			2
@entity0 has , however , interviewed numerous witnesses by phone			1
several people noted that major unrest came to @entity7 's doorstep in the capital @entity42 for the first time on sunday , where crowds of anti-government protesters loudly decried @entity8 's current government , set fires to cars and braved gunfire by uniformed and self - styled security forces			1
gunfire rang out in the capital 's streets , some of it coming from the barrel of masked men driving through the streets , said one witness -- who , like many others , is n't identified for safety reasons			1
a woman said she saw demonstrators running down a @entity42 street outside her window , chased by apparent mercenaries in pickup trucks			2
the men were firing at the demonstrators and throwing tear gas at them , according to the witness			2
many families have closed their windows and turned off their lights out of fear , she said			0
demonstrations , clashes and damage were especially evident around @entity81 and the presidential palace , individuals on the ground told @entity0			2
according to one person , the heavy guard detail normally positioned outside @entity7 's residence disappeared sunday night			1
protesters who set fire to cars in the middle of the street soon thereafter bolted after hearing gunfire , a @entity8 man said			1
" someone came and said that @entity7 's people are in the next street , " he said			1
" we could hear the gunshots were very close			0
" by early monday , @entity42 's streets had calmed down , though frequent gunshots could still be heard			1
" now we hear gun shots mostly -- a lot of them , " said one man , adding that he also heard people protesting in the distance			0
a relative calm had also descended by then in @entity27 , @entity8 's second largest city and a hotbed of @entity109 sentiment			1
but it was a far cry from the violence there on sunday			0
the central government lost control of @entity27 , with multiple witnesses reporting that protesters took over @entity8 's second - largest city with support from some military who dropped their allegiance to @entity7			1
however , his son @entity122 -- in a speech on state television early monday -- continued to insist the military remained loyal to the ruling government and would be taking an increasingly active role in suppressing unrest in the coming days			2
the reported power shift followed fresh clashes that left 25 dead earlier in the day , a doctor at @entity27 's @entity133 said			1
a source at @entity135 , the city 's other major hospital , said there were 10 people dead there sunday			0
one man told @entity0 that uniformed troops opened fire on thousands of mourners as they passed through the streets during a funeral procession honoring those killed the previous day			2
protesters later sunday packed at least one car with explosives and sent it crashing into a compound wall at a military camp in the eastern city , eyewitnesses said			2
security forces then fired on the protesters as they attempted to breach the camp			2
on the camp 's southern side , meanwhile , protesters drove a tank from a nearby army base in another attempt to break in , witnesses said			1
they have also obtained other weapons , the protester said			0
@entity8 state television reported the camp has been defended , and that protesters were being warned on loudspeakers not to attack the compound			0
the network called it an act of sabotage			0
the protester said that the military camp is significant because it houses @entity7 's eastern palace			1
" it 's a symbol of his dominance here , " he said			0
" and it 's the last symbol , basically			0
" a protester said some fellow anti-government demonstrators had other weapons			0
@entity122 accused criminal elements of stealing arms and firing them in an attempt to cast blame on military and security forces			0
medical sources and other sources have said that at least 219 had died nationwide in the violence			0
but @entity122 said that international media had overstated the death toll			0
he also claimed foreign nationals and " illegal immigrants " had stirred the uprising , with some dissenters attacking government installations as well as stealing caches of weapons			0
@entity0 's @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203 contributed to this report .			1
