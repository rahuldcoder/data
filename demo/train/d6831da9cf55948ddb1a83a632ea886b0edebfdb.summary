-- prosecutor @entity1 went on the attack again thursday , trying to discredit a defense witness for @entity4 on the last day of testimony before the court takes a two - and - a - half week break			1
forensics expert @entity9 , on the stand for a third day , was grilled over his interpretation of a reconstruction of the scene where double - amputee runner @entity4 killed girlfriend @entity13 in february last year			1
one key line of questioning dealt with the position of a magazine rack within the toilet room where she was shot			1
under pressure from @entity21 , @entity9 directly contradicted @entity4 ' version of where he saw the magazine rack when he entered the toilet room after shooting @entity13			1
in his own testimony , @entity4 said that when @entity13 was slumped over the toilet bowl , she was n't on top of the magazine rack			1
he said it was off to the side			0
@entity1 then showed him a photo of the toilet with the magazine rack standing in a pool of blood -- and @entity4 said it must have been placed there			1
@entity9 directly contradicted this in his testimony thursday , saying the rack was moved after it was in the pool of blood			2
the question is important in part because @entity4 contends that police contaminated the crime scene by moving certain key items , including the magazine rack			1
@entity4 also told the court he opened fire after hearing the sound of movement within the toilet room , which made him believe the door was opening			0
in retrospect , he concluded that what he heard was the magazine rack moving			2
in his questioning thursday , @entity1 also tried to cast doubt on @entity9 's analysis of a mark on the toilet door that the expert says was made by @entity4 kicking it with his prosthesis , and about the expert 's ballistics reconstruction			1
bullet ricochet @entity1 's aim in the murder trial is to prove that @entity4 intentionally shot and killed @entity13 after a heated argument in the early hours of @entity72 last year			1
the defense team is seeking to cast doubt on that account and prove that the star sprinter shot his girlfriend through the closed toilet door after mistaking her for an intruder			2
in his testimony wednesday , @entity9 disputed a conclusion by a pathologist on the cause of @entity13 's back wounds			2
the pathologist said they were made by a bullet ricochet , while @entity9 said they were made by the magazine rack			1
the autopsy said they were made by a blunt , hard object			0
following @entity9 's testimony , the court in @entity93 , @entity94 , was adjourned until may 5			2
when the court reconvenes , the next defense witness will be @entity97 , manager of the @entity98 where @entity4 lived and the first person the athlete called after he shot @entity13			1
gripping trial the trial is scheduled to continue until the middle of may			0
judge @entity104 will decide the verdict in collaboration with two experts called assessors			0
@entity94 does not have jury trials			0
if @entity4 is found guilty of premeditated murder , he faces 25 years to life in prison			2
