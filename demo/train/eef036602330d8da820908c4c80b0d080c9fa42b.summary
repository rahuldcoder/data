@entity0 -- divining what is going in @entity4 's opaque political world is like reading tea leaves : it may be interesting but it 's ultimately a futile exercise			2
the 18th @entity8 of the 82 - million - member @entity9 , expected to happen in mid-october , will be a landmark event -- it will usher in a new generation of leaders to rule @entity4 for the next 10 years			1
yet , little is known about what to expect			0
@entity16 , the incumbent president and party general secretary , will step down and be replaced by @entity18 , the current vice president			1
many members of the 25 - member @entity20 and the 371 - member @entity21 are also expected to be replaced			1
these are the two policy - making bodies in the party 's pyramid organization			2
who will compose the @entity28 leadership ? speculation is rife			2
who are the next generation of @entity4 leaders ? as the congress approaches , political maneuvering has increased among various camps , and there have been a few surprises already			1
last week , @entity38 , head of the party 's @entity39 , which runs the @entity43 organization 's day - to - day affairs and oversees security of the top leaders , was abruptly " reassigned " to the important but less powerful @entity47 department			2
analysts say @entity38 , 55 , may still be chosen for the @entity20 , but he is out of the running for the all - important @entity50 -- the very highest decision - making body made up of a handful of key leaders			2
@entity54 and the politics of @entity4 succession " this is evidently a loss for @entity16 , " said @entity57 , senior fellow at the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) , a think tank based in @entity59 " @entity38 was a @entity16 protégé			1
who knows if it was related to the car crash ? " in the early morning on march 18 , @entity38 's son , @entity64 , 23 , was said to have smashed a black @entity65 into a concrete - wall on the side of @entity0 's @entity68 while driving at high speed			2
disgraced party chief looms large over @entity4 's leadership much was made of the incident in the media internationally , but much of this was rumor and speculation that @entity1 can not substantiate			2
reports and discussions about it have been censored from the local media and @entity81			0
@entity64 may have survived the car crash but it seems to have damaged his father 's political career and dented the party 's reputation			2
" it casts a negative light on corruption among party members and makes the public question the legitimacy of the officials ' source of wealth , " said @entity87 , a professor at the @entity88			0
" it has tarnished the image of the leadership			0
" did the car scandal benefit @entity18 at the expense of the outgoing @entity16 ? other analysts actually credit president @entity16 for the move on @entity38			1
" the leadership is establishing a rule : your son misbehaves , you pay , " said @entity105 , a long - time observer of @entity4 politics			1
" this move must have been approved by @entity16 and therefore it does not necessarily weaken him			1
" @entity38 has been replaced by @entity111 , 62 , a provincial party chief who is known to be an ally of @entity16 and has previous ties with the vice president			1
@entity111 , analysts say , may have been a compromise choice			0
according to @entity87 , @entity18 has been smart to avoid clashes with the current leaders			1
" what @entity18 needs to do now is to keep a clean slate and a low profile and figure out how to consolidate his power , " he explained			1
" everybody knows he is the presumptive new leader , so he only needs to be patient			0
" @entity18 also needs to stay above the factional fights			1
@entity4 's leaders are widely seen as divided into two camps : that of retired president @entity129 and that of president @entity16			1
former president and party chief , @entity132 , retains residual influence even in retirement			0
the 86 year old has a network of allies in the party -- sometimes known as the " @entity138 " after the former president 's time as party leader in the city -- which he uses to influence policy and personnel decisions			0
last summer @entity132 was rumored to have died , but he has since made a rare public appearance looking frail but fairly healthy			0
some @entity4 - watchers believe @entity132 's influence has waned , but others say he remains a player			0
" he is still influential , " said @entity57			0
" his @entity151 faction remains quite important and his people are in key positions			0
" others say @entity16 's camp , known as the @entity156 ( @entity156 ) faction , referring to the youth organization that @entity16 headed for years , will dominate the new leadership			1
" the lineup of the @entity50 and the full @entity20 will show that the @entity156 remains the largest faction , " said @entity160 , a @entity4 expert at the @entity161			0
" the @entity156 is especially strong among the next tier of leaders , born in the 1960s , who will take over power in 2022			0
" @entity160 said @entity16 is now in a good position to anoint one of his protégé , @entity170 , as @entity18 's presumptive successor in 2022 by getting him selected into the next @entity20			1
the younger @entity16 , 49 , is a provincial party chief who also headed the @entity156			2
the official line is that the transition is now firmly locked in place , but it would not be @entity4 , or the @entity9 , if it were as straight - forward and predictable as that			1
" my guess is that appointments can be changed up until the very last minute , " @entity105 said			0
" it was so ten years ago , it will even more so today			0
" @entity181 contributed to this report .			0
