-- a battle is raging in the nation 's capital over who should be nominated as the next chairman of the @entity6			1
as president @entity8 considers his choices , all sides are pushing their candidates			0
the two main contenders to replace outgoing chairman @entity12 are the current vice chairwoman of the @entity6 , @entity14 , and @entity15 , an economics adviser to president @entity8 , former treasury secretary and president of @entity17			1
@entity15 ' acerbic and dismissive intellectual style , his support of bank deregulation ( he was a key leader in the @entity23 administration 's team that worked with @entity24 to repeal the @entity25 , a depression - era law separating investment banking from institutions with federally insured deposits ) , his fight against regulating financial derivatives ( a major source of the financial crisis ) and his successful advocacy with @entity24 to allow higher executive pay and bonuses for financial executives whose firms received billions in federal bailouts during the financial crisis all feed the opposition , who believe that @entity14 is perfectly well qualified to lead the @entity6			1
although many people do n't know it , the @entity6 does n't just regulate the money supply -- it is also a principal regulator of @entity47 's largest banks			1
it 's not so much that @entity14 is a far superior candidate -- after all , she and @entity15 are on the same page when it comes to monetary policy			1
there is little indication from her record about what kind of approach she would take on regulation			2
but compared with @entity15 , she can not be worse			1
the real issue is : given @entity15 ' track record , could he be a tough regulator ? supporters of @entity15 say he can be tough			1
but evidence from his days in government and on @entity65 suggest otherwise			0
@entity15 has advocated for limited regulation throughout his career			1
in september 2000 , while he was the treasury secretary , he said that the role of financial regulation was to find policies that " help to expand the size of ( financial ) markets			2
... @entity74 becomes that much more important , to ensure that government is not preventing or distorting the development of fast - growing markets			0
" he also told the @entity78 that " it is the private sector , not the public sector , that is in the best position to provide effective supervision			0
... in the past few years , the private sector has risen to meet the challenges ... and we have seen significant self - correction			0
" a decade later , at a conference in 2011 , @entity15 showed no second thoughts on his previous deregulatory policies , arguing that the financial crisis was not caused by " new - fangled financial instruments , " including the derivatives that he fought to protect from regulation in the late 1990s			1
when it comes to @entity65 , @entity15 said he obtained insights based partly on working part - time for the hedge fund @entity97 and @entity98 where he earned over $ 5 million in just one year			2
@entity15 said the experience gave him " a better sense of how market participants sort of think and react to things from sort of listening to the conversations and listening to the way the traders at @entity97 thought			2
" according to former colleagues at @entity97 , @entity15 was directly involved in sales , including sales of what turned out to be highly overvalued mortgage - backed securities to @entity113 sovereign wealth funds , the kind of securities that were deeply implicated in the financial meltdown			1
he was also a " prized spokesman " for @entity97 , " routinely made himself available for private consultations " with prospective and existing clients , and met with investors from the @entity47 and abroad			0
one young female quant who worked with him had this to say on her blog , " but when i think about that last project i was working on , i still get kind of sick to my stomach			0
it was essentially , and i need to be vague here , a way of collecting dumb money from pension funds			0
there 's no real way to make that moral , or even morally neutral			0
" by " dumb money , " she is referring to the fact that investors , including those who manage public pension funds , routinely buy certain types of secure assets on a regular schedule or in other predictable patterns			0
hedge funds like @entity97 take advantage of that predictable behavior by selling these assets to investors for a slightly higher price			0
because of the huge dollar value and volume of these investments , such strategies can make hundreds of millions of dollars for hedge funds			0
now , @entity15 has defenders			2
@entity152 , a strong advocate of financial regulation who worked for @entity15 at the @entity154 as assistant secretary for financial institutions said , " i would n't have gone to work for @entity15 if he did n't believe in financial regulation			1
" but arguing that @entity15 ' multi-million dollar sales work for a hedge fund somehow adds to his qualifications for the @entity6 chairman job is ludicrous			1
he was working for and dressing up the work of financial professionals selling high - priced investment products made even more expensive by the exorbitant fees charged by hedge funds			0
moreover , hedge fund investments often are inferior for investors			0
in 2012 , an investor would have done much better by simply buying the s&p 500 index instead of a hedge fund			0
to convince investors to pay their high fees , hedge funds do a lot of active selling and cozying up to money managers			0
@entity15 was part of this public relations strategy -- a glittering ornament to lure in investors			2
there 's nothing illegal in all of this			0
but there 's also nothing in @entity15 ' experience to suggest that he would be a tough regulator			1
his supporters include people like @entity191 , former chairman of @entity193 and co-chairman of @entity195 , and @entity196 , who as president of the @entity198 and later treasury secretary , refused to take a tough line on bank regulation			2
think they are pushing @entity15 because he 'd be a tough regulator ? think again			1
@entity47 needs a @entity6 leader who will protect small businesses , ordinary investors , and the economy from misbehavior by big banks and financial corporations			1
we need a fierce regulatory watchdog , not a lapdog of the banks			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			2

@entity15 is a top contender for the job of chairman of the @entity6
@entity216 : given @entity15 ' track record , he is unlikely going to be a tough regulator
he says @entity15 supported deregulation of banks and higher pay for financial executives
@entity216 : we need a fierce regulatory watchdog at the @entity6 , not a lapdog of the banks
