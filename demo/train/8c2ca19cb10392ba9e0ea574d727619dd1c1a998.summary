@entity0 and @entity1 were n't expecting a frenzied mass of " divergent " fans to greet them at a premiere in early march			1
well , they 'd better get used to it			0
the two stars of the new film , set for release friday , were the focus of a swarm of at least 200 fans , mostly female , who screeched and cheered for their heroes at a special @entity15 screening			1
@entity0 wore @entity16 ; @entity1 , an affable @entity17 , signed autographs			1
the fans ate it up			0
and why not ? " divergent " is being touted as the new " @entity23			1
" that 's no surprise , given its action - oriented female heroine , youthful cast and post-apocalyptic setting			1
the film is based on the first book in a best - selling trilogy by @entity32 , a series that also earned comparisons to @entity35 ' " @entity23 " works			1
if " divergent " does half as well as the " @entity23 " films -- the most recent of which , " @entity39 , " topped the 2013 box office and made $ 865 million worldwide -- its backers will be very happy			1
which is why @entity0 -- perhaps best known for performances in the film " @entity46 " and the tv series " @entity48 " -- is receiving @entity50 - type attention			1
she 's on the current cover of @entity52 , has been the subject of press releases noting her choice of designer clothing , and is being mentioned in gossip - style headlines mentioning the age of her first kiss ( 15 , incidentally ) and her love of " descendants " co-star @entity63			2
@entity0 , 22 , says she 's a little surprised by the response			1
" i do n't know much about that world			0
none of us really engage in social media , " she said at a @entity68 interview the day after the @entity15 screening			0
" so last night was sort of a shock			0
' oh , other people know about this movie , too			0
' " @entity1 , 29 , has n't escaped the microscope			1
the actor is also the subject of publicists ' e-mail blasts and has been romantically linked to @entity0 in @entity83 tabloid headlines			1
though @entity0 told @entity85 that she has n't had a boyfriend in five years , the two do have an easy rapport			1
@entity1 said he welcomes the fans ' passion			1
" it 's good to be involved in something that has a bunch of people invested in the material already , " he said			2
' you have to make bold decisions ' ah , passion			0
it certainly does n't hurt ticket sales -- and neither does the tittle - tattle			0
" divergent " has been a hot property ever since author @entity32 sold the rights to the trilogy before she even graduated college			0
the story is set in a post-apocalyptic @entity107 in which the culture has been divided into five factions : @entity111 , who believe in altruism ; @entity113 , the peaceful ones ; @entity115 , the intellectuals ; @entity117 , the bluntly honest ; and @entity118 , the fearless warrior class			0
@entity122 " prior -- the character played by @entity0 -- is the daughter of two @entity111 parents			1
at 16 , like everyone else , she takes an aptitude test to find the most appropriate faction for her personality			0
she finds out she 's " divergent , " with equal aptitude for more than one faction			2
however , since such a classification is considered threatening to society , she 's told to keep the information to herself			1
she ends up joining @entity118 , much to the disappointment of her parents -- " faction before blood , " goes one of the culture 's mottoes -- and undergoes a boot camp at which she meets four ( @entity1 ) , one of the camp leaders			1
from there the plot concerns @entity145 ' attempts to fit in -- or not -- four 's secrets ( there 's a connection with a political leader ) and run - ins with the @entity115 chief , @entity151 , played by a chilling @entity152			1
the book series , which also includes the sequels " insurgent " and " @entity156 , " has sold more than 10 million copies			2
more importantly , it 's got that powerful fan base			2
there are several fan sites devoted to the series on the @entity163 , and @entity32 has more than 200,000 @entity165 followers			0
such a following can both help and hurt a movie			0
certainly there will be huge crowds awaiting " @entity145 's " midnight showing , but if @entity173 ( and the ruins of @entity107 , which are their own character in the movie ) do n't live up to their vision , the backlash could be fierce			1
@entity1 , however , says that comes with the territory			1
" you have to make your own decisions based on what you perceive the character to be , " said @entity1			1
" you have to make bold decisions , stick with them , and whatever will be , will be			0
" your guide to film adaptations in 2014 ' everyone is multi-dimensional ' the two had plenty of help getting into character			2
they had their own boot camp to get into physical shape , and did some of their own stunts -- though stuntpeople stood in for the big falls , and special effects helped with certain details , like a zip - line run off @entity107 's @entity201			2
they did go up in the big @entity203 on the @entity204 , which @entity0 remembers as a special night			1
" it was a full moon , so we got to watch the moon go across the sky and go up and down this crazy 75 - foot ladder			0
it was just magic , " she said			0
" it 's one of those moments where you wonder how you got this life			2
" indeed , @entity0 continues enjoying " this life			1
" she says she 's had good mentors in actors such as @entity63 , @entity220 and @entity152 , people who " show up early , show up prepared			2
" " they all have in common the fact that they love the art of acting , still			0
they love being on a movie set , " she said			0
as " @entity145 's " release nears , the two -- along with youthful co-stars including @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 -- will see if they can hold on to their love of acting in the midst of a celebrity culture that would like to reduce them to gossip fodder as superficial as members of " @entity145 's " single - minded factions			1
history offers mixed lessons : the shrewd and award - winning @entity245 and the " @entity246 " kids have apparently succeeded			0
other young actors burn out as quickly as they rise			0
@entity1 -- a veteran of several @entity83 tv series , including an episode of " @entity250 " -- seems intent on making the most of the opportunity to widen his horizons			2
as pre-production begins on " insurgent " and " @entity156 , " he 's already done two other films : a version of @entity259 ' novel " @entity263 " and a film called " @entity261 " from indie director @entity262			2
he may be living by one of the lessons of the film			0
" one of the key messages of the film is that no one can be categorized , " he said			0
" and @entity0 ? she 's taking it easy for now			1
but , like the quietly astute @entity145 , she understands that you do n't present all that you are			2
" i think it 's important to have your own secrets , preserve your own personal space , " she said			0
" you do n't give all of yourself away			0
" young adult books from page to screen			0

" @entity145 " has expectations of being new " @entity23 "
@entity283 , like book , features strong teen heroine , *postapocalyptic* society
