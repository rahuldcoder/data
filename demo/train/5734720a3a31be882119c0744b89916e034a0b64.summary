@entity0 , @entity1 -- his home in @entity0 is just as he left it when he boarded the plane to the @entity7			1
a tiny tin - roofed room in a run - down building that 's now the focal point of so much of the paranoia ricocheting across the world			2
but while the @entity7 struggles to contain the fear stirred up by @entity15 's diagnosis in @entity16 , here there 's a different concern			1
here , they are struggling to come to terms with the mounting death toll of all those who -- like @entity15 -- came in contact with the pregnant woman who gave him @entity26			1
already nine others are dead or dying			2
all the neighbors have been put quarantined			2
and local officials are trying to get in touch with everyone who may have interacted with the pregnant woman , @entity32			1
that number ? " right now , according to statistics that we got , close to 100 , " says @entity34 from the local @entity26 task force			1
desperation and despair here in @entity0 , like in several @entity42 hotspots , the challenge of containing the virus is staggering			1
the disease has killed more than 3,400 , the @entity43 said			2
@entity1 has been hit the worst -- with 2,069 dead			2
hence , the desperation and despair in the homes along 72nd @entity48			0
if any of those people had direct contact with @entity32 ' saliva or other bodily fluids , they are in danger of contracting the highly infectious disease -- and potentially passing it on			0
unsuspecting contact @entity32 was in her seventh month of pregnancy when she collapsed			0
@entity32 ' 12 - year - old sister @entity59 was with him at the time , as were several other people			0
" we 've been through this over and over , " @entity34 says			0
" we tell the people no matter how much you love the person			0
it is the health authority that is responsible to pick up the sick			0
" but none of them knew @entity32 had @entity26 , @entity59 says			1
both of @entity32 ' parents have tested positive for @entity26			1
another woman who also ran to @entity32 ' side was rushed to a hospital days later			1
soon afterward , a neighbor was tasked with he difficult task of telling her 9 - year - old daughter that mom is never coming home			0
and @entity15 lies in a hospital bed in @entity16 , critically ill. all of them contracted @entity26 trying to do good			1
helping @entity32 was the right thing to do -- the right thing with devastating consequences			0
@entity2 's @entity85 reported from @entity0 ; @entity86 wrote from @entity87			0

@entity15 and others rushed to help a pregnant woman who fell
