-- @entity1 said it resumed drilling monday on a relief well , as efforts to permanently seal the previously leaking @entity6 oil well appeared to be entering their final stages			1
drilling on the relief well resumed at 2:40 p.m. et after a massive sleeve protecting the well from sudden , large increases in pressure was successfully installed over the weekend			1
installing the device " resulted in the necessary conditions to commence the finalization of the relief well , " @entity13 , the government 's appointed national incident commander in charge of overseeing the oil spill response , said in a statement monday			2
@entity13 said the relief well remains " the final step that will ensure the well is fully and finally killed			0
" drilling had been stopped since august 10 when a tropical storm threatened conditions at the site , forcing the oil company to suspend operations			2
since then , weather delays in the storm - prone @entity6 as well as scientific and technical debate on how to proceed have extensively prolonged the timeline for definitively plugging the well			0
before drilling resumed , the relief well had been at a measured depth of 17,909 feet and was less than 50 feet vertically and four feet horizontally from the original well			1
" relief well operations will consist of drilling and ranging runs that will guide the rig 's drill bit to intercept the well 's annulus			2
following the intercept , heavy drilling mud and cement will be pumped into the annular space to complete the isolation of the @entity50 well , " @entity1 said			1
while @entity1 successfully stopped the flow of oil on july 15 by embedding a cement plug near the top of the well , permanently sealing the well has been a process full of fits and starts			1
just last week , @entity13 laid out a possible timetable that pushed the " bottom kill " -- a process in which heavy mud and cement are pumped into the bottom part of the original well via the relief well -- into october			1
but with the new sleeve in place , the timetable is expected to be shortened " significantly , " @entity13			0
it could take about four days to finish drilling and intercept the original well			2
@entity1 would then need a few more days after that to complete the bottom kill			0
federal investigators and the @entity76 are now poring over a device called a blowout preventer , a piece of equipment that failed on april 20 when @entity1 's oil platform exploded , killing 11 people			0
the blowout preventer was designed to stop oil from spewing by sealing the well pipe			0
instead , it failed , triggering the world 's largest accidental oil spill and sending 4.1 million barrels of oil into the @entity6 .			0

the leak was successfully stopped on july 15 with a cement plug
efforts to permanently plug the well have been *hampered* by weather and other *factors*
the relief well is near the original well , and @entity1 says drilling resumed monday
