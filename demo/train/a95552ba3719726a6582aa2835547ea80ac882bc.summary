@entity0 , @entity1 -- a fighter jet was shot down and burst into flames saturday in the area of @entity6 , @entity1			1
explosions could also be heard in the city , which has been a stronghold for rebels opposing @entity1 leader @entity10			1
it was not immediately clear who the fighter jet belonged to			2
the development is significant , in part , because @entity6 has been considered the center of the opposition forces			2
the opposition has been pushed back from other cities that it used to have control of , and rebels have vowed to defend @entity6 to the death			1
a day earlier , the @entity1 government said it was abiding by a cease - fire , but witnesses have said violence from @entity29 forces have continued			1
@entity1 late friday called for international observers to come and verify the cease - fire			1
one day after the approval of a @entity36 resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians , @entity33 president @entity32 warned @entity10 to pull back from several besieged cities -- or face military consequences			1
but @entity32 insisted that @entity33 troops will not be deployed in @entity1			1
@entity33 secretary of state @entity43 was flying to @entity44 for a saturday meeting with @entity47 allies and @entity49 partners			1
at least 28 people died and hundreds were wounded as fighting raged in the cities of @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 on friday , according to @entity57 , military spokesman for the opposition			2
@entity1 's deputy foreign minister called for observers from @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 " to come to @entity1 as soon as possible ... to make sure that there is a real cease - fire on the ground			1
" @entity68 also noted that the " door is open for any other countries to send observers			2
" @entity68 said the media is distorting @entity1 military actions and said the country has evidence of " crimes against humanity conducted by the rebels			1
" government forces " did not cause the deaths of any civilians , " instead inflicting casualties on armed rebel militias , and will not assault @entity6 , @entity68 said			1
forces loyal to @entity10 are honoring a cease - fire and are not fighting a militia group that is making advances in the eastern part of the country , according to @entity68			1
rebel forces are advancing on the town of @entity93 , south of the rebel stronghold of @entity6 , said @entity68			1
the @entity96 press agency @entity95 confirmed to @entity2 the movement by a militia group and said it recorded video			2
witnesses in the western city of @entity54 said earlier friday that a pro-government assault is persisting and casualties are mounting as countries backing the council 's move , such as @entity107 and @entity96 , get their military resources into place to enforce the measure			2
" what cease - fire ? " asked a doctor in @entity54 , who described hours of military poundings , casualties and dwindling resources to treat the wounded			2
" we 're under the bombs			2
" this morning , they are burning the city , " the doctor said			2
" there are deaths everywhere			2
" " @entity54 is on fire , " according to an opposition member , who said tanks and vehicles with heavy artillery shot their way into the city thursday night and the assault continued friday			0
he said @entity10 's regime announced a cease - fire to buy time for itself			0
" outside @entity55 in eastern @entity1 , @entity2 's @entity137 said she heard explosions , listened to fighters ' accounts of heavy casualties and saw ambulances			1
she said fighters , who do n't trust @entity10 , believe that the declaration is a trick			0
" everybody around us is on very high alert , still expecting the worst , " @entity146 said			0
@entity150 said 26 people died in @entity54 , 83 were seriously wounded and hundreds were slightly wounded			0
in @entity55 , two died , three were seriously wounded and hundreds were slightly wounded			0
there was no immediate casualty count for @entity56 , @entity57 said			0
@entity2 could n't independently confirm the witness accounts , and it is impossible to tell whether word of the cease - fire declaration trickled down to pro-government forces			2
in remarks televised around the globe , @entity1 foreign minister @entity161 said in @entity0 that the country decided on " an immediate cease - fire and the stoppage of all military operations			1
" he noted that the country , since it is a member of the @entity174 , is " obliged to accept the @entity36 resolution that permits the use of force to protect the civilian population			2
" @entity32 said friday that " left unchecked , we have every reason to believe @entity10 ( will ) commit atrocities against his own people " and the surrounding region could be destabilized			1
power and water must be restored to several cities , he added			2
" these terms are not negotiable , " @entity32 said			1
if @entity10 does n't comply , the @entity174 resolution will be imposed through military action , the president said			0
the @entity174 resolution , while not authorizing such a move , does not preclude the @entity33 from arming rebels , the @entity33 ambassador to the @entity174 said friday			0
ambassador @entity190 told @entity2 's " @entity191 " that the " @entity33 is ready to act " and that @entity10 " should be under no illusions that if he does n't act immediately he will face swift and sure consequences , including military action			0
" when asked whether the @entity33 was planning to provide weapons to the opposition , @entity196 replied , " we are focused immediately on protection of civilians , on ensuring that the march to @entity6 does not continue and that those who are most vulnerable have the rights and protections that they deserve			0
" koussasaid that @entity1 plans to protect civilians and provide them with humanitarian assistance and that it is obliged to protect all foreigners and their assets			1
he said the @entity1 government was disappointed in the imposition of a no - fly zone , arguing that it will hurt the civilian population			1
he also said the use of military power would violate the country 's sovereignty and go against the @entity174 charter , but he acknowledged that some countries may yet intervene			2
" there are signs this indeed might take place , " @entity161 said			0
@entity225 , a @entity96 @entity226 spokesman , said the cease - fire announcement " does not change the threat on the ground			0
" " @entity10 is privy to folkloric declarations , and we must remain extremely vigilant with regards to these declarations , " he said			0
@entity234 , who called the situation " fluid and dynamic , " said the @entity33 wants actions , not words			1
" we will continue to work with our partners in the international community to press @entity10 to leave and to support the legitimate aspirations of the @entity1 people , " she said			1
the @entity1 government " must immediately cease all hostilities against the civilian population , " @entity174 @entity243 ban ki - moon said friday in @entity245			1

the @entity289 , meanwhile , announced friday that defense secretary @entity290 will travel to @entity291 this weekend as the @entity33 and other nations deliberate action against @entity1			1
" there is no consideration being given to delaying this trip , " spokesman @entity294 said at the @entity289			0
he said @entity290 maintains constant communications links with @entity299 wherever he goes and can " carry out his responsibilities no matter where he is in the world			0
" asked whether the cease - fire declaration complicates a @entity174 - sanctioned intervention , @entity304 , a @entity305 expert at the @entity306 , said , " it is going to make it tougher without a doubt			0
" " one should credit @entity32 for getting the international community behind him , but it came at the price of momentum			1

the opposition , with devoted but largely untrained and under - equipped units , has suffered military setbacks this week			0
