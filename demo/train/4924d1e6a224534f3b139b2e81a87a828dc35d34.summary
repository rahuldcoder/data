-- the @entity1 is running out of time , and ideas , for turning the economy around before the fall elections			1
almost three years into recovery , the @entity7 economy added only 80,000 jobs in june , marking its third consecutive month of poor job growth			1
the @entity11 noted that the @entity7 gained just 225,000 jobs in the past three months combined , making it the weakest quarter of job growth since the labor market began to recover in 2010			1
the unemployment rate , still 8.2 % , has been stuck above 8 % for 41 straight months , the longest streak since the @entity17			0
a government report found that 85,000 @entity7 left the workforce in june to enroll in the social security disability insurance program			1
that means that more workers joined the federal government 's disability program in june than got new jobs			2
how did the @entity1 respond to the anemic report ? " there are no quick fixes to the problems we face that were more than a decade in the making , " @entity26 , chairman of the president 's @entity27 , said in a written statement			1
in other words , any chances for economic recovery before the fall elections look slim			0
more importantly , there is a profound lack of urgency from the @entity1 for any large scale , serious reforms			0
in fact , @entity26 went on to claim the economy really is n't as bad as we think			2
" the economy has now added private sector jobs for 28 straight months , for a total of 4.4 million payroll jobs during that period , " he said			0
the obvious problem here is that @entity56 has been president for more than 40 months			1
the @entity1 conveniently blames republicans for decades of lost jobs , but forgets to mention the @entity7 lost 4.3 million jobs in president @entity56 's first 13 months in office			1
@entity26 concluded , " [ @entity62 ] t is important not to read too much into any one monthly report and it is informative to consider each report in the context of other data that are becoming available			0
" this is n't the first time the @entity1 has used this excuse			0
in fact , the @entity72 campaign was quick to put together a list of the 30 times the @entity1 has used this same excuse , dating back to november 2009			1
is the @entity1 perhaps telling us something more significant : that we should n't read too much into the entire term of @entity56 's presidency ? in @entity81 on friday , @entity56 excused the jobs report by again claiming he inherited the worst economy since the @entity17			1
he added that the jobs report is " a step in the right direction " and that " it 's still tough out there			0
" the president appears intellectually and ideologically spent , and it 's not just @entity57 saying that			2
@entity91 , former secretary of labor in the @entity94 administration , wrote recently , " [ @entity95 ] he excuse is wearing thin			0
it 's his economy now , and most voters do n't care what he inherited			1
" he added , " [ @entity101 ] e has to show he understands the depth and breadth of this crisis			0
" it 's not so clear the president does			2
on monday , he again called to repeal the @entity109 tax cuts on the highest earners , a contentious partisan issue that the public knows will not be solved before the elections			2
in his weekly address he continued to push for more construction projects and increased financial aid for college students			0
even to keynesian economists on the left these are hardly bold policies a party can rally behind			0
the economy is shaping up to be the most important factor of the 2012 elections , yet the president seems content to rest his re-election chances on worn - out , recycled policy proposals and ad hominem attacks on @entity72			1
it 's hard to see how this is a winning strategy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity134 .			2

@entity134 : @entity7 economy continues to experience poor job growth
he says president @entity56 is n't proposing any bold ideas
@entity56 tends to place blame for economic woes on @entity109 administration , @entity134 says
@entity134 : @entity56 's campaign is focusing on worn - out proposals , attacks on @entity72
