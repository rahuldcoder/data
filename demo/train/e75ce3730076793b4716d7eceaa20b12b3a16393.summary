in his 20 years of practicing emergency medicine , dr. @entity1 says , he remembers every patient who has walked out of his hospital alive after receiving cpr			0
it 's not because @entity1 has an extraordinary memory or because reviving a patient whose heart has stopped sticks in his mind more than other types of trauma			0
it 's because the number of individuals who survive @entity5 is so small			1
in fact , out of the hundreds of @entity5 patients who have come to the @entity19 hospitals where he has worked , @entity1 recalls no more than one individual a year making a full recovery			1
since it was introduced to @entity26 physicians in 1960 , cardiopulmonary resuscitation has become a staple of emergency medicine			1
between 2011 and 2012 , more than 14 million people in 60 countries were trained in cpr administration , according to the @entity32 ( @entity33 )			0
but recent studies suggest that the number of lives saved by @entity5 is n't as many as your favorite tv police drama would have you believe			1
initially , @entity5 combined mouth - to - mouth breathing with chest compressions to keep blood and oxygen circulating throughout the body until further measures could be taken to restart the heart			1
in 2008 , the @entity32 began teaching " hands - only cpr , " in which the rescuer pushes down hard and fast in the center of the chest -- about 100 compressions per minute -- and forgoes rescue breaths			0
the new cpr procedure was developed to simplify the process and eliminate the " yuck factor " that potential rescuers could associate with putting their mouths on an unconscious victim			0
studies showed that the modified procedure was as effective as chest compressions combined with artificial respiration			0
yet despite advancements , the overall effectiveness of @entity5 remains disappointingly low -- although the practice still has its defenders			1
exact survival rates are difficult to come by , as studies generally look at specific populations			0
a 2012 study showed that only about 2 % of adults who collapse on the street and receive @entity5 recover fully			1
another from 2009 ( @entity33 ) showed that anywhere from 4 % to 16 % of patients who received bystander @entity5 were eventually discharged from the hospital			1
about 18 % of seniors who receive cpr at the hospital survive to be discharged , according to a third study ( @entity33 )			1
so when did the misconception about the effectiveness of @entity5 begin ? some researchers argue that television created the myth			1
between 1994 and 1995 , researchers from @entity86 watched 97 episodes of " @entity88 , " " @entity89 " and " @entity90 , " taking note of when @entity5 was administered during each show			1
in these dramas , 75 % of patients survived immediate cardiac arrest , and two - thirds were discharged from the hospital with full brain function , a stark contrast to the much smaller percentage found by medical studies			1
@entity1 says the few who do survive after @entity5 are what physicians describe as the " healthy dead " : i.e. " a boy who drowned moments before , " " a man who collapses while running a marathon " or someone experiencing a mild heart attack			1
more common are the " unhealthy dead " : those with terminal illnesses , the chronically ill and patients who do not receive cpr within five to 10 minutes of cardiac arrest			1
" in these cases , ( @entity5 ) is unnecessarily burdensome , invasive and arguably cruel , with little to no chance of benefit , " @entity1 said			2
many survivors suffer abdominal distention or broken rib cages ; some have severe brain damage from being without oxygen for so long			0
still , trauma workers , including physicians , nurses and @entity126 , are required to do anything and everything in their power to revive the patient unless an advance directive -- a specific written and signed order -- specifies that resuscitation should not be performed			2
many veteran physicians have begun to opt out of the resuscitation practices they often administer to their patients			2
in a 2012 article published in @entity139 , " how doctors choose to die , " retired physician dr. @entity137 reveals that members of his profession frequently turn down everything from chemotherapy to @entity5			2
he notes that years of witnessing and administering " medical care that makes people suffer " leads many doctors diagnosed with terminal illnesses to choose to spend their last months or years at home and without medical treatment			0
@entity137 recalls some fellow physicians who go as far as getting tattoos that read " no code " to remind rescuers to forgo any attempts at revival			2
@entity137 is still an advocate for learning @entity5 , but he warns against hoping for miracles			2
" people have too high expectations about what 's going to happen , " he said			0
" they think you 're going to do cpr and 99 out of 100 times ( the patient will ) be revived , which is just not the case			0
saying that @entity5 is ineffective is " the wrong attitude " and a " self - fulfilling prophecy , " said dr. @entity167 , former chairman of the @entity32 's @entity168			2
" if you expect it to go poorly , than it will			0
" instead , he says , we should be doing more studies : for example , comparing cpr teaching methods with cardiac arrest survival rates in major cities in the @entity26 to understand how and when the technique is most effective			1
in some cities that have less cpr training , the survival rate is indeed low , @entity167 says			0
but in other metropolitan areas with strong training programs and quick @entity183 response times , half or more victims survive			0
@entity167 suggests teaching cpr in schools nationwide starting in seventh grade , as well as increasing access to automated external defibrillators , portable machines that shock the heart to get it to " reboot			0
" using an aed , according to @entity167 , increases the probability of survival to 80 %			2
promising research continues for substitutes to @entity5 , but " there are no reasonable alternatives " yet , @entity1 said			2
for now , emergency care providers have to use what they know			0
that does n't mean @entity1 is happy with that reality			0
he remembers when he started as an @entity126 : " i was led to believe that for those who experienced cardiac arrest , if you put your heart into reviving them , they would come back			1

@entity5 was introduced to @entity26 physicians in 1960
study : about 2 % of adults who collapse on the street and receive @entity5 recover fully
study on tv dramas found that 75 % of patients survived immediate cardiac arrest
