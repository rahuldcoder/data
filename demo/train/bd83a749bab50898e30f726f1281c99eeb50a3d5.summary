-- the debate over genetically engineered salmon should be put in the proper context : as the world 's population grows at an accelerating pace , so does the consumption of seafood			1
this is true not only because there are more mouths to feed , but also because as people become more aware of the health benefits associated with eating seafood , more are switching from meat to fish			1
to satisfy this demand , we have become very sophisticated fishers , with ever - growing fleets , factory fishing ships and very effective gear			0
we efficiently hunt our own seafood in the wild ; it seems natural to all of us , while we do not hunt for wild chicken , beef or pork			2
but fish is harvested at a rate that exceeds the fisheries ' ability to replenish themselves			2
according to the @entity35 , more than 50 percent of the world 's main fisheries stocks are fully exploited , while another 28 percent are over-exploited or depleted			1
fish species that used to be plentiful , such as cod , plaice , haddock and others , are now rare in the wild			2
the king of the oceans , the giant bluefin tuna , is now near the @entity45 , its stocks dropping precipitously in the past decade alone			0
reflecting upon these declines , the @entity47 has become the world 's second largest importer of seafood ( after @entity52 ) with more than 80 percent of the seafood consumed in this country coming from overseas			0
and seafood imports contribute $ 9 billion annually to the @entity47 trade deficit , largest among all agricultural products			0
fisheries scientists have repeatedly warned us that if we do not change our commercial fisheries practices , we will run out of the vast majority of the commercial species by the middle of this century			0
like any other animal or plant crop , fish and seafood must be produced through farming -- or aquaculture -- and the wild stocks should be protected so they can recover			1
as a society , we must accept that while it is nice to eat wild salmon , there is no wild @entity77 salmon out there ; we must get used to eating farmed fish			1
the aquaculture industry faces a huge challenge			1
it must grow fish in a way that is economically viable and environmentally responsible			0
and this is where genetic engineering enters the picture			0
genetically engineered fish , like the @entity89 salmon , offer great benefits to fish farmers and should be available to the industry			1
if used carefully , genetic engineering can produce fish that reach the market much faster , as in the @entity89 salmon , and use less feed ( and thus less fish meal )			1
as the science develops , it could generate fish that are resistant to disease ( currently the aquaculture industry loses billions of dollars annually to disease in its fish population ) and healthier for the consumer -- making beneficial omega - 3 oils available in fish that do not normally contain them , for example			1
the public should not be scared by the term " genetic engineering			0
" this powerful platform requires making only relatively minor and very targeted modifications to the animal genome , compared , for example , with selective breeding and domestication , where we manipulate many genes over generations without knowing exactly what is altered			0
we have all been eating selectively bred fish , chicken , beef and other animals for many years without thinking twice about it			1
the @entity89 @entity77 salmon has only one extra copy of a fish gene inserted into its genome			2
this one addition , while enhancing the hormones of the growth axis in fish , operates within the fish 's physiological range			2
and these are fish hormones that have no effect on the human consumer			0
the @entity89 salmon is no different from conventional farmed salmon in its composition and health benefits , and the @entity147 has concluded that it is safe for people to eat			1
the single most important caution i would offer is that we must ensure that these fish , as well as any other farmed but domesticated fish ( non-genetically engineered ) , can not escape from the farming systems to our seas or rivers			2
the @entity89 salmon must be fully contained , both biologically and physically			0
indeed , @entity89 salmon are sterile fish , and therefore unable to reproduce even if they escape			1
these fish are intended to be farmed only in fully contained , land - based farming systems			0
every new operation that would grow these fish for sale in the @entity47 would be subject to @entity147 approval , according to the @entity147			0
by using multiple and redundant mechanical means to prevent escape ( such as screens and filters ) , as well as reusing the culture water , the systems should be close to full containment , having minimal interactions with the environment			1
and the implementation of these new , land - based and fully contained marine aquaculture systems offers an opportunity for aquaculture to become more efficient and environmentally sustainable			1
however , before approving the genetically engineered fish for use in aquaculture , as a scientist , i would like to see the @entity147 and @entity185 be less presumptive and more experimental about the potential environmental risk of @entity89 salmon			1
i want to see scientific data , proof beyond a shadow of a doubt , that if fish do escape from containment , they will not survive , will not breed and will be purged from the environment			2
experiments to demonstrate this are all feasible , but will take a few more years to complete			0
and finally , consumers should absolutely be informed whether the salmon they are buying is genetically engineered or not			0
it is our responsibility to make sure the public is educated so the fear factor dissipates and the consumer can make rational decisions regarding genetically engineered salmon			0
not labeling the fish will harm the industry altogether as people who do not want genetically engineered fish will avoid farmed salmon altogether			1
as a society that is in dire need of more plentiful and healthier food , we must accept the practices of modern agriculture in fish farming			1
we must trust the power and virtue of the advanced sciences and technology in providing new generations with high - quality food			0
we must stop depleting the wild stocks , reducing our biodiversity and harming the oceans around us			2
sustainable aquaculture , based on responsible modern biology , including genetic engineering , will provide the world with the seafood that we need and help conserve our planet			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			2

@entity235 says people are eating more fish , so natural fish stocks are *rapidly* depleting
he says we must accept that if we want to eat fish , we have to farm them like any other food
aquaculture industry 's challenge : to be safe , efficient ; also offers big promise , he says
@entity235 : @entity251 salmon should be available , but labels , *safeguards* to prevent escape crucial
