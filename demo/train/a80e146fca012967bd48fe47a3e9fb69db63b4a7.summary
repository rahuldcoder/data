@entity1 administration officials showed a so - called " @entity4 " video of @entity3 at a classified @entity6 briefing on wednesday , but the session failed to convince numerous skeptics that swapping @entity10 terror detainees for the captured @entity12 sergeant was the right thing to do			1
" i remain as deeply skeptical about this as i did before this conversation that we just had with the administration			2
for two days now , we 've asked questions , many of which have not yet been fully answered , " sen. @entity19 , a @entity20 of @entity21 , told @entity22 after the briefing			1
since announcing @entity3 's release this past weekend , administration officials have said they fast - tracked the operation over concerns about his health and safety , which appeared to be in jeopardy			1
a senior defense official said on wednesday that recent intelligence , in addition to two proof - of - life videos released in recent months , underscored the concerns			0
@entity22 has reported on the existence of the most recent video , believed to be recorded last december , which @entity43 officials have said showed a marked deterioration in @entity3 's condition			1
@entity46 wanted tougher deal for @entity3 lawmakers emerging from the closed session had mixed reaction as to whether his health was evidence that he needed to be immediately freed			1
sen. @entity54 , an @entity55 @entity20 , said @entity3 " did n't look good			1
i understand the emotional power the video had on the president			2
" president @entity1 has defended his decision to get @entity3 back now , saying he was not going to leave him behind with the @entity43 in the final stage of its @entity62 operation			1
opinion : @entity3 's release : motives , mistakes and excuses @entity3 was the only remaining @entity43 military captive from the conflicts in @entity70 and @entity62			1
the video was short , and @entity3 spoke @entity72 , said @entity54			1
he spoke softly and slowly , almost slurring			0
there were references to the recent death of @entity76 in the video			2
@entity54 said there was no new information from the officials who briefed the senators on what @entity3 's ailments were			1
" his condition in the video made it clear he was not in good condition and this was a proof of life video we insisted on before negotiations commenced			0
once having seen it , as we saw it , i 'm sure there was great concern about his condition , " democrat @entity92 of @entity55 said			0
@entity10 video shows @entity3 's release in @entity62 @entity102 sen. @entity101 of @entity103 , like several other senators , was skeptical the video provided enough evidence to warrant the extraordinary prisoner swap that some lawmakers called too open ended and could possibly have repercussions for @entity43 security down the road			1
" you could tell he had been drugged and he was in a different state , " @entity101 said			0
adding later : " that did not sell me at all			0
the proof of life was five months ago , december ... that was not the person who was released here			0
he was not in that dire situation when he was released			0
" opinion : five tough ethics issues in @entity3 swap others noted that it took five months for the @entity127 to cut a deal to free @entity129 after seeing the video			2
complex negotiations were conducted through the government of @entity133 , which accepted the transfer of the five @entity10 prisoners who had been held for years at the @entity43 detention facility at @entity137 , @entity138			0
who was swapped for @entity3 ? several senators said the video should be made public			1
it 's not clear if that will happen			0
the administration officials told the senators that none of the detainees in question were involved in attacks against the @entity43			2
" i 'm a little bit more reassured " of the president 's decision , @entity54 said , adding , however , that the administration could not guarantee that the former detainees would n't return to the battlefield			2
republicans and @entity102 raised serious concerns more than two years ago with the administration about the possibility of such a swap but said promised consultation never materialized			0
in all discussions and the private communications about such a step , there were exchanges about possible conditions placed on the detainees -- including renouncing @entity169 and violence in the region			0
but those terms were not included in the final deal			0
celebrated at first , @entity3 's release raises questions fellow soldiers call @entity3 a deserter , not a hero @entity179 journeyed deep into @entity62 books , language to save his son			2

@entity1 administration gives senators classified briefing on @entity3 decision
lawmakers say they saw " @entity4 " video that was *key* in administration decision
the administration 's rationale for trading terror *suspects* has come under fire
sen. @entity19 said the session shed little new light on the issue
