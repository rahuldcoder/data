@entity0 , @entity1 -- it is just a brief moment in time , the time it takes to draw a breath , to click your fingers , the time it takes to detonate a bomb			2
life , as you knew it , changed forever			2
on the morning of july 7 , 2005 , i was just another anonymous commuter on my way to work during rush hour in @entity18 's crowded metropolis			2
i was short and spritely , weaving through what seemed like a never - ending sea of people to ensure i had a chance of getting on a @entity24 train			2
what i did n't know then was that a 19 - year - old named @entity26 , determined to detonate a bomb he was carrying in his backpack , was boarding the train carriage at the same time as me			2
we were just seconds out from the station platform when " click " -- no bang , no boom , no noise at all , just a split second between life and death , between light and complete darkness			2
although we were all anonymous strangers in that carriage , in those crucial moments we became each other 's saviors , a much - needed hand to hold , a comforting and reassuring voice to hear , we became united in our disbelief , our shock , our pain and our absolute horror			2
an hour passed before rescue could reach us , although the memory is one of timelessness -- the world had ceased to be , nothing made sense and my mind was trying desperately to process every aspect of what i was experiencing			0
i felt no physical pain , and yet as the thick darkness began to break , the light revealed it was only a thread of skin that was left attaching my legs to my body			0
it was the brutal images of those who had lost limbs from the @entity71 being carried from the scene that resonated deep within my heart -- for i knew , i knew what life is without legs , i knew what they would face in the coming days , weeks , months and years			1
for me , it was the euphoria of survival , of having life that ultimately saved me from feeling hatred , bitterness or indeed to seek revenge for my loss			1
i was alive and i was still " @entity89 " and yes , although there was a significant part of my body missing , somehow my understanding of life grew			0
it was witnessing and indeed being a recipient of the brilliance of humanity that also shaped my " new " life -- and there was no better sign of this absolute brilliance than in my hospital wristband			0
it chillingly read " one unknown -- estimated female			0
" i remember vividly reading those words again and again and each time they revealed a deeper sense of humanity and what was important			0
that tag said to me that people actually put their own lives at risk in trying to save mine , trying to save as many as they could			0
to them , it did n't matter who i was , whether i had a religion , if i was rich or poor , if my skin was dark or fair , indeed if i was male or female -- all that mattered was that i was a precious human life			0
being " @entity121 " also told me that on that morning @entity26 did n't set out to kill or maim me , @entity122			1
he did n't know me , he did n't know what i thought or what i felt : to him i was conveniently placed in a group called " them " as opposed to " @entity127			1
" i 've often thought , what if we had the chance to talk before he detonated his bomb ? i was n't given a choice , i was n't offered a chance to " defend " my life ; instead he presumed that i was his enemy			1
its list is broad and cruel , sweeping from @entity140 to @entity141 , killing and maiming those who have innocently been in detonation range			1
@entity144 knows no names -- just the value of every single life			0
but must " we " forgive our hurt in order to heal ? for me , the person whose actions took my legs is dead			1
he is only a name to me			0
there is no chance for dialogue or for to say " sorry , " to even want my forgiveness			0
my healing is what i now understand to be a continuous journey , one where i must always find strength in love , of self and humanity and to stay focused on what really matters ; leading a life that honors my great gift			0
replacing the idea of recovery with a strategy for adjusting , adapting and ultimately accepting " change " has equally helped me to understand that i will never know what it is like to have my legs back -- to have that physical freedom again			1
i had to create a " new " idea of normal			0
to be filled with hatred , as those who created such devastation , was never an option			1
i allowed the brilliance of the unconditional love that i had experienced throughout my rescue and the following months and years to fill me and show me how to live			1
i knew that my life , this life number 2 had to be dedicated to making a positive difference and to building a sustainable peace -- to endeavor to eradicate ignorance in the world , replacing it with empathy			0
while i wish the world would just " stop " -- for there to be an end to innocent lives being killed or maimed by acts of terrorism or extreme conflict , i now realize , after years of deep thought , that all we can change is ourselves			1
i hold onto the belief that if each of us , each " @entity121 " made a positive contribution to our own lives , that if we strived to grow to our full potential and truly honour the preciousness of being " here " -- then when multiplied , the acts of one become many and the acts of many can change the world as we know it			1
