many patients fled @entity0 hospital when @entity7 was confirmed , he said , and the hospital is struggling to respond to all the call - outs to suspected cases			1
could the @entity7 outbreak spread to the @entity46 ? " right now there is no treatment for @entity7 , so the most effective measure we can take is to contain the spread of the disease , " said @entity47 , the @entity19 emergency coordinator for @entity7 intervention			0
" that is why we need to start working immediately			0
other cases need to be rapidly identified because containment is what can stop it , " said the expert from the aid group , which is also known as @entity19			0
the @entity1 government has asked people in western @entity1 to travel by public transport only if it is necessary			2
the outbreak began in the @entity10 district in western @entity1			1
