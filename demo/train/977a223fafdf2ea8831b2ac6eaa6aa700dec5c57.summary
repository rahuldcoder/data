-- from swimming pool slides and oversized @entity5 stations to @entity7 walls and @entity9 consoles , hotels all over the world have committed to having fun			1
some have transformed their lobbies and public spaces into the kind of playgrounds children and grown - ups alike can enjoy , inspiring a bit of healthy competition among guests			1
here are eight properties that stretch and bounce and slide beyond a place to lay your head : @entity24 , @entity25 this massive resort on @entity25 's coast packs in a lot : nature lovers are especially spoiled with plenty to do , from salt marsh exploration to kayaking to an after - dark survival skills course where younger guests are groomed for the outdoors with lessons in pitching tents , lighting fires , reading a compass , etc. the resort can also provide a very thorough primer in gyotaku fish printing that includes dissecting the fish			1
for guests who prefer a more traditional take on play , there 's a life - size chess set on the lawn , and a very civilized weekly bingo service , where men age 12 and up are required to wear a jacket			1
8 elegant @entity53 mansion hotels @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 this months - old @entity58 property in @entity55 's @entity60 neighborhood was meant to attract those traveling to the city for business -- the startup variety			1
to appeal to that " work hard , play hard " mentality , a massive @entity7 wall greets guests in the lobby			1
the rest of the hotel 's playful perks can be found in the sharply curated playroom , where @entity9 consoles share the space with ping - pong and pool tables , a massive assortment of board games and life - size jenga			1
the phone booths , which have been updated with @entity83 tablets that will allow users to @entity84 , are a nice touch			2

10 record - setting natural wonders @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 located on the southwest corner of continental @entity97 in the @entity95 fishing town of @entity94 , @entity93 is a true family - friendly destination , where every member of the brood can find something to do			1
everything from stand - up paddling to kayaking to jeep safaris to surfing to @entity107 on the beach are on offer			1
or give @entity110 a try			0
this racquet sport , popular in the @entity113 and @entity114 , is a combination of tennis and racquetball			0
@entity118 has two glass - sided courts in which to learn			1
the resort 's @entity120 acts as its entertainment hub , where children can let loose at the playground while older children head to the @entity126 to play foosball and video games			0
bonus : all dining venues here are outfitted with play areas separate but visible from and near to the actual dining room , allowing adults to eat in peace without totally losing sight of the kids			0
@entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 this resort in @entity140 's @entity142 sits on 12,000 acres -- that 's roughly the size of @entity145 -- so there 's always a variety of activities available for guests			1
one of the most fun , given the abundance of space , is a game of geocaching , a high - tech treasure hunt in which a gps device helps participants locate hidden canisters , or geocaches , that reveal interesting information about the resort 's surroundings as well as local fauna and flora			1
some of the geocaches might reveal a puzzle to solve for an added challenge			0

younger guests , on the other hand , can take on the @entity177 contest			0
7 secret @entity179 islands @entity180 , @entity181 this pod - style hotel right next to the @entity183 may not win points for space -- a luxury in @entity181 ( though its 4,000 square - foot terrace is the largest hotel terrace in town ) , but it certainly delivers if it 's whimsical playfulness guests are after			2
for example , luggage storage is manned by a mechanical robot , programmed to collect suitcases and backpacks and stuff them into their assigned lockers			0
but @entity180 's @entity198 is its @entity5 wall , which was unveiled in january 2014			1
the 30 - foot long lobby wall includes thousands of colorful bricks , tools for @entity180 guests ' next masterpieces			2
some have drafted messages while others used the @entity5 bricks to create more ambitious visuals ( flags , animals , cartoon characters , even @entity181 landmarks )			1
see some examples of them online			0
@entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 playful activities at the original @entity221 property ( there 's also one in @entity224 ) are heart - pounding but fun			2

guests who have completed pilates or the core - conditioning workout can take on this core - strengthening task -- cowboy hat not included			2
there 's also an adventurous bike track for riders of all levels and the renowned @entity236 -- with its multistep , vertical climbing elements and zip - line finish -- is sure to push all sorts of physical boundaries			2
to unwind , guests can always participate in a game of @entity244			0
@entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 the @entity245 property in the @entity247 countryside is so committed to its family - friendly programing that it has planned activities during key school holidays			2

there 's also @entity260 -- a wooden playground stocked with swings , slides and a climbing wall			0
" @entity267 " may prefer the @entity265 with its games			0
the grand estate , however , is better suited for outdoorsy endeavors -- think boat rides on the canals , croquet , falconry , quad bikes -- especially when a new equestrian center opens this spring , featuring stabling space for 12 horses and a petting zoo			0
@entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 @entity282 lives up to its name			0
one of the most design - forward hotels in the world has an exterior resembling a slice of watermelon			1
while this hotel does n't offer the games of many of the hotels on our list , its curvaceous silhouette merits a mention -- and takes the edge off the see - and - be - seen vibe that attracts local glitterati to the rooftop terrace and bar			1
many guests have not been able to resist trying to slide on a sloping wall near suites on the edges of the property			0
and fortunately , the multicolored indoor pool has something few city pools do : a slide .			0

life - size chess , @entity5 and @entity7 are among the amenities at some hotels
