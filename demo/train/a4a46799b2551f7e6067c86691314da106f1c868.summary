-- no way , @entity2			0
what else can you say when @entity5 -- the former baseball slugger who accidentally shot his own finger last month -- claims that part of said finger fell off during a poker tournament ? no word yet on whether @entity5 won the hand , but he does n't seem to be too broken up about it , given the tenor of his @entity15 feed			1
" i put my finger in the freezer , " he wrote			0
" anyone want appetizers ? " the joke stems from an incident earlier this week that no one else has reported independently , outside of @entity5 's tweets			1
he claims that someone has a video of part of his finger coming off during a poker tournament , yet that footage has n't been broadcast by anyone			1
@entity30 , @entity5 's representative , told @entity0 that the ex-player 's camp has the video and may sell it to media outlets			2
for now , though , all the world has to work from is @entity5 's @entity15 feed -- the same place where , just a few days ago , he was opining that " comet transport is the key to our survival " in the wake of the @entity43 's putting a vehicle on a comet after a 310 - million mile journey			2
and , even for those with a strong stomach , it 's a lot to digest			0
it starts with his admission friday that " my finger fell off " during a poker tournament the previous night			1
@entity5 then chimes in with this tweet : " my finger should have been amputated from the beginning			2
it was very loose with no bone to connect it			0
it was also smelling really bad			0
" and for good measure , the one - time @entity61 's basher shared a gruesome photo saturday of his finger before it fell off			0
" i bet a long time ago you could easily loose ( sic ) a finger a hand or even your life in a poker game if you could n't pay up , " @entity5 joked			1
it all stems from an incident last month , when @entity5 accidentally shot himself in a finger on his left hand while cleaning a handgun , according to @entity77 police			1
@entity5 tweets photo of wounded hand the incident helped bring @entity5 -- who won the @entity81 in 1986 , was the @entity82 two years later and finished his 17 - season career with 450 home runs -- back into the public spotlight			1
besides his exploits on the field , the admitted steroid user has claimed there was widespread use of performance - enhancing drugs in @entity92			0
he wrote two books on the subject : " @entity95 : @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , and @entity99 got @entity100 " and " vindicated : @entity101 , @entity102 , and the @entity103 to @entity104			0
" fast facts on @entity5 @entity0 's @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 contributed to this report .			2
