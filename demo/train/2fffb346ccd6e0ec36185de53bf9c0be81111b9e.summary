-- the consumption of @entity3 football , @entity5 's most popular sport , is built on game - day traditions			1
this week fans will dress head - to - toe in team colors and try out new tailgate recipes in parking lots before filing into 16 @entity3 stadiums to cheer on their team -- which , thanks to the league 's parity , will likely still be in the playoff hunt come december			1
but a game - day ritual of the digital age -- tracking scores , highlights and social - media chatter on a mobile device -- is n't possible inside many @entity3 venues because the crush of fans with smartphones can overload cellular networks			1
the improved home - viewing experience -- high - def tv , watching multiple games at once , real - time fantasy - football updates and interaction via social media -- has left some @entity3 stadiums scrambling to catch up			1
it 's one of the reasons why , before rebounding last year , the @entity3 lost attendance between 2008 and 2011 , forcing the league to alter television - blackout rules			1
in may 2012 , @entity3 commissioner @entity41 announced an initiative to outfit all 31 @entity3 stadiums with @entity44			1
but with the start of the 2013 regular season just days away , less than half of the @entity3 's venues are @entity44 enabled and no stadiums have launched new @entity44 systems this year			1
part of the reason for the delay is some stadium operators are waiting for the next generation of increased @entity44 speed before installing networks , said @entity58 , editor in chief for @entity60			1
another reason , @entity58 said , is that the cost of installing @entity44 will come out of the pockets of venue owners and operators who have traditionally not needed to invest in such costly projects			2
instead , they receive public money to help build stadiums and television money for the right to broadcast games			2
" stadium owners and operators need to get their hands on the fact that they need to put in @entity44 like they need to put in plumbing , " @entity58 said			1
@entity80 , the @entity3 's vice president of club business development , said the league is still searching for a telecommunications partner that can help tackle challenges of stadium location , design and tens of thousands of fans all trying to access the network at the same time			1
" yes , we are working on it as hard as we can , " he said			0
" but the technology just is n't where it needs to be to deliver what we want to deliver			0
" the league is unveiling a variety of technological enhancements at stadiums in 2013 , including cameras in locker rooms , massive video boards that will show replays of every play , a " fantasy football lounge " with sleek technological amenities , the ability to listen to audio of other games from inside the stadium , team specific fantasy games and free access to the league 's @entity3 @entity110 cable channel for season ticket holders			1
@entity80 emphasized the league 's role as a storyteller and said it is striving to use technology to provide fans in stadiums with unique content			2
" the most important people in that stadium are the 70,000 paying customers , " he said			0
@entity125 , president of the @entity126 and co-chair of the @entity3 's digital media committee , told @entity129 in january that he hopes to have all stadiums equipped with @entity44 for the start of the 2015 season			1
the @entity126 helped lead the way last year by offering fans free @entity44 throughout @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity137			2
the network was built by @entity140 - based @entity139			0
" we certainly encourage that any club would invest the way they have , " said @entity80			0
eleven other stadiums currently have @entity44 capability : @entity145 in northern @entity146 , the @entity147 in @entity148 , @entity149 in @entity150 , @entity151 in @entity152 , the @entity153 in @entity154 , @entity155 in @entity156 , @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity159 in suburban @entity160 , @entity161 in suburban @entity162 , @entity163 in @entity164 and @entity165 in @entity166			2
the 20 other stadiums have @entity44 in certain areas , but mostly operate on wireless service provided by @entity170 and / or @entity171			2
many of these venues have installed distributed antenna systems ( @entity175 ) to increase wireless connectivity while they seek answers to the challenges of enabling stadiums with @entity44			2
@entity175 connects cellular antennas to a common source , allowing wireless access in large buildings like stadiums			0
@entity60 published its inaugural state of the @entity186 this year , based on responses from more than 50 @entity3 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , university , pro soccer , pro golf and car racing sites			0
the survey concluded @entity175 is currently more popular at venues because it boosts connectivity to mobile devices while dividing costs between carriers and the facility			0
@entity203 fans will benefit from a new @entity175 tower , installed by @entity170 , and an upgraded @entity171 tower this year at @entity207 , @entity203 president @entity202 said the improved technology will serve as a test case for whether to install @entity44 in the future			1
" if you are a consumer or a fan , you really just care about being able to get on your mobile device , and that 's what we 're trying to tackle , " he said during a july press conference			0
@entity58 said @entity175 is a quick fix and is not a long - term strategy , especially when it comes to fans watching tv replays on their mobile devices			0
" the video angle is the big thing for @entity44 , " he said			0
" @entity226 just simply wo n't be able to handle the bandwidth			0
" he also pointed out that it is not in the best business interest of cellphone carriers to install @entity44 , as it would take customers off their networks			2
also complicating @entity234 's 2015 goal is the lack of league consensus about who will build @entity44 networks in all of its stadiums , and when			1
by contrast , @entity188 named wireless - tech company @entity242 its official technology partner in april , launching a two - year study to solve mobile - connectivity issues in its 30 stadiums			0
@entity58 said @entity188 was in a position to strike the overarching deal with @entity242 because team owners made the league responsible for digital properties during the 1990s			0
the @entity3 has a variety of rights deals , including direct tv and @entity170 , which make it more difficult for the league to agree on a single @entity44 plan , he said			1
" my opinion is they ( the @entity3 ) will eventually have something more like @entity188 , " @entity58 said			0
" @entity188 has shown it is a great way to make money			0

despite efforts of commissioner @entity41 , less than half @entity3 stadiums have @entity44
at games , the crush of fans with smartphones can overload cellular networks
the improved home - viewing experience may have caused a recent *dip* in @entity3 attendance
some stadium operators are waiting for a faster version of @entity44 to be developed
