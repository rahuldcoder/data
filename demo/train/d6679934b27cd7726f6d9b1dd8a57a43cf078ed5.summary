-- on a wild night of upsets at the @entity3 , virtually nothing seemed to be going " @entity5 's " way			1
the @entity7 series , which concludes its much - lauded run next sunday , did n't win a lot of honors it was expected to			1
@entity11 , who was tabbed for outstanding lead actor in a drama , lost to " @entity15 's " @entity14			1
co-star @entity16 , who could have won supporting actor in a drama , ended up watching " @entity20 's " @entity19 take home the trophy			1
but when it came time for the big prize , outstanding drama , things broke for " @entity5			1
" " holy crap ! i did not see this coming , " said creator @entity28 , citing all of the other nominated shows in " this golden age of television " " @entity5 " felt so fortunate to be a part of			1
" this is the answer to a wish and a prayer for me , " said @entity11 backstage			1
" i 've been blessed in the past and this show has been nominated in the past , but what i really wanted was what we got , to celebrate the win for the writing crew and cast			1
this is one helluva party , and what a way to go out			1
" @entity28 paid tribute to @entity48 , the service behind another drama nominee , " @entity51			1
" " @entity48 kept us on the air , " he said			1
" the show would not have lasted beyond season 2 if not for streaming on demand			1
" emmys : the winners list " @entity5 's " @entity59 also won an @entity60 , for outstanding lead actress			1
like " @entity5 " itself , which has taken viewers in strange directions over five seasons of turning mild - mannered chemistry teacher @entity66 into meth king @entity67 , the @entity57 were anything but predictable			1
oh , " @entity82 " took home its fourth straight emmy for outstanding comedy , and @entity71 won lead actor in a comedy , but even those honors were uncertain after a night in which such shows as " @entity76 , " " @entity77 " and " @entity78 " won awards over perennial champs			1
and the emmys like nothing better than to honor its perennial champs			2
as host @entity86 said at one point , " this just in : nobody in @entity90 is winning their emmy office pool			2
" past @entity57 hosts show up to help @entity86 ' i do n't know how to feel yet ' the tone was set right away , with best supporting actress in a comedy series going to " @entity99 's " @entity98			1

um , i got ta go			2

backstage , @entity98 was only slightly less stunned			2
" i 'm scared , honestly , " she said about holding the @entity60			2
" i 'm scared because it was unexpected , so i do n't know how to feel yet			2
i have therapy next week			2

" " well , crap			2
did n't expect this , " he said			2
" you 're glad to be invited to the party , there are six of us nominated			0
there easily could have been 10 other guys , " he added backstage			0
" i felt the work stood up to what the other guys were doing , but we 're all doing different things , so it 's anybody 's game to win			0
i was happy to win , but surprised			0
" @entity14 beat @entity11 , " @entity51 ' " @entity130 and " @entity132 's " @entity131 , among others			0
