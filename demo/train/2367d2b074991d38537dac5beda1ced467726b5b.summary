@entity0 -- federal officials are investigating whether this week 's @entity5 storms caused a pilot to crash his small plane into a mountain in a southern @entity10 state park , authorities said friday			1
it is the second death that might be related to the storms			1
@entity14 , 65 , a former commercial airline pilot from @entity15 , @entity10 , slammed his twin - engine @entity17 plane into a 3,300 - foot mountain summit in @entity20 on monday , authorities said			1
that park is just 11 miles from the city where @entity14 lived			0
he was the small plane 's sole occupant			1
on friday , @entity26 spokesman @entity25 said his agency and the @entity28 will examine if the weather was a factor in the fatal crash			1
" yes , weather will be among the factors @entity28 and @entity26 examine , " @entity25 said in an e-mail response to @entity1			1
the state park 's superintendent , @entity35 , said visibility on the mountain was poor around the time of the crash			1
" the weather was not favorable at that time of the morning , " @entity35 told @entity1 on friday			0
" visibility was between 100 yards and sometimes , at the top of the mountain , it would be 10 to 15 yards when my partners and i were searching up there			1
we could n't even see the sheriff 's helicopter			1
" the other life that might have been taken by the storms was that of @entity50 , 39 , of @entity51 , @entity10 , who also died in @entity52 when her car was swept off a road and into @entity55 on wednesday , according to the coroner 's office			2
" weather might have been a factor , but we ca n't determine that until we complete the investigation , " @entity52 sheriff 's deputy @entity60 said friday			2
" we 're investigating that as a traffic collision			2
" overall on friday , rain - soaked residents of @entity10 were enjoying a reprieve from the storms that inundated the state for most of the previous week			1
another round of wet weather was expected to hit the @entity70 over the holiday weekend			0
during friday 's break in the storm fronts , authorities were able to provide a detailed account of the dramatic search for the downed pilot			1
rains so deluged the chaparral , grasslands , and hiking and equestrian trails on the mountain that @entity35 's four - wheel drive vehicle became stranded and a park ranger 's all - terrain vehicle toppled over , @entity35 said			1
so his crews searched on foot in the rain for about 1.5 miles until they discovered the wreck and dead pilot , he said			2
" that 's how messy it was			2
the trails were running like small rivers so it made recovery efforts very , very difficult , " @entity35 said			2
the plane was found near a @entity99 crash site where a training plane from nearby @entity101 also hit the mountain and killed its crew , @entity35 said			1
@entity14 , the small plane 's pilot , began his 75 - mile flight from @entity106 to @entity107 around 9 a.m. monday , but when he did n't land on time , authorities launched a search for him , @entity35 said			1
the pilot was found after the @entity52 sheriff 's office pinged his cell phone and investigators were able to track down his location , @entity35 said			1
the eight - hour recovery mission left some search members with near hypothermia because of prolonged exposure to rain that fell at a rate of a half - inch or an inch an hour , @entity35 said			2
sixteen low - security state inmates , who are often used for brush clearing in wildfires , were deployed in the search , and they had to carry @entity14 ' body for three miles from the soaked mountaintop , @entity35 said			1
@entity130 ' stranded vehicles were left abandoned for four days because the heavy rain and mud made it impossible for them to be moved , @entity35 said			0
the wrecked plane , which remains on the park summit , could be retrieved by next week , he said			1
friday marked @entity10 's second day of sunshine after five days of storms			2
at @entity144 's renowned @entity143 , surfers dressed as @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 were riding mild waves during a lull in the weather thursday , said @entity144 resident @entity148 , who videotaped the spectacle for a @entity150			2
but many residents of the region and three nearby @entity154 states spent the time recovering from the damage wrought by torrential rains			1
@entity10 lt. gov. @entity158 late thursday afternoon proclaimed a state of emergency for @entity160 , @entity0 and @entity162 counties , to expedite government assistance and aid to the region			0
two days earlier , a similar order was issued -- by gov. @entity167 -- for @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity15 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity173 counties			0
@entity158 is serving as acting governor while @entity167 is out of the state			0
the series of @entity5 fronts pounded southern @entity10 hardest , but the storms also strafed western @entity179 , southern @entity180 and southwestern @entity181 , which all were under flood watches and warnings that stretched until early friday morning			2
mudslides remain a threat because of the soggy ground			0
conditions cleared in much of those areas thursday , but the damage left by days of seemingly nonstop rain remained			0
that meant the chore of the day was cleaning up mud and flood damage to many homes and businesses			0
they may not have long to dry out : the @entity198 forecasts that another storm system could dump light to moderate rainfall on much of southern @entity10 on @entity202 and sunday			0
rainfall accumulation measurements at airports in @entity0 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity162 and @entity207 for the month -- ranging from 6 to 8.9 inches -- made this december the wettest ever in each of those locales , even with more than a week still to go			0
in one stark image , the field and sprawling parking lot of @entity211 in @entity212 was under water early thursday , as crews worked desperately to pump out water			0
they succeeded , as the @entity218 and @entity219 faced off in college football 's @entity220			0
the @entity222 was one of many at dangerously high levels , reaching 16.6 feet -- 0.6 feet above flood stage -- at 11 a.m. thursday			0
the heavy rains also produced potential health hazards for swimmers and surfers on particular parts of @entity0 ' beaches , and @entity0 officials warned recreational users to be careful when next to drains or waterways because they carry bacteria and trash from streets and mountainsides			1
" fortunately , discharging storm drains , creeks , and rivers only comprises a small portion of the beach , and therefore , anybody who wants to go to the beach will be able to enjoy their outing , " said @entity241 , the county 's public health director and health officer			1
throughout the @entity154 , water roared through desert washes and urban waterways alike , and the ferocious strength of the rapids often damaged bridges or suburban concrete creek beds -- and dumped mud everywhere			1
the series of storms is known as the " @entity264 " because of its origin near the @entity267			0
the upside to the severe weather , according to experts , is the relief the heavy rainfall has brought to a region devastated by drought and fires			0
the storms also brought heavy snow to mountain areas in @entity10 and other states			0
the @entity198 issued hazardous weather outlooks for northern @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity280 and most of @entity281			0
an avalanche warning was in effect for parts of @entity281			0
and locally heavy snow was forecast for much of the country 's midsection , with the weather agency issuing advisories from @entity289 east to @entity290			0
@entity1 's @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity296 contributed to this report .			0
