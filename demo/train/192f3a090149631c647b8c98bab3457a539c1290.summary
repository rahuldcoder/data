i ca n't imagine growing up in the ' 50s , certainly not as myself or any degree of myself that i am now			0
my strongest sense of the ' 50s comes from @entity4 and feminist critiques of the era			0
but the 1950s tv stereotypes of women as housewives in fancy dresses and high heels gave way to a much more interesting cast of characters when the ' 60s came along			1
in real life , there probably never was a family as picture perfect and problem free as the ' @entity22 , but @entity7 was certainly the archetype of her decade			1
as a child , i did n't quite know what i wanted to be when i grew up , but i knew who i did n't want to be			0
i did n't want to be @entity7			1
the sense that she never had any fun , never broke the rules , possibly never even exhaled			1
her entire existence circumscribed by her white picket fence			0
i could n't imagine being @entity37			0
or the mom from " @entity38			0
but then along came @entity43			1
i still had n't been born when the tv show " @entity43 " premiered in the 1960s			1
in fact , my parents had just barely met			0
but years later , as a kid in the early 1980s , i would watch reruns of " @entity49			1
" finally , a tv woman i wanted to be			2
she hung out outside the house			0
she was everything ! video : name that 60s tv show as a little girl , i did n't realize all that had happened in the years between @entity7 and @entity60 , everything that had changed in society to create a new era of culture that mirrored a new day in @entity65 , one in which the compulsion to be @entity7 was eroded as a universe of @entity69 arose			1
suddenly , women like @entity71 ( from " @entity72 " ) , independent with careers , were on the scene			2
there was agent 99 from " @entity77 " and @entity78 from " @entity79 " --- not just career women , but spies			1
who kicked ass ! there was @entity85 in " @entity86 , " who had immense powers --- just like @entity89 , about whom i indeed dreamed			0
and most ground - breaking of all , there was " @entity92 , " which featured a leading @entity95 character who was a single mother			1
@entity96 introduced me to the 1960s @entity98 menu of gender roles and role models unheralded in the narrow black - and - white confines of the 1950s			0
i could watch tv and see women with personalities and problems and potential			1
of course , in hindsight , none of these shows was perfect			2
@entity111 's character @entity85 in " @entity86 " was always apologizing for using her magic			0
@entity114 's character in " @entity115 " called the man whose house she lived in " master			0
" and @entity43 was always being scolded by her overly stern and moralizing father , who like many male characters in shows of that era , seemed designed as stand - ins for older men of the 1950s generation who were deeply wary of , if not downright resistant to , the equality of women			1
at the end of each episode of " @entity49 , " @entity129 would usually turn to the camera and announce the life lesson she 'd learned , usually imparted by her father			2
so in a way , metaphorically , she was still bowing to and echoing unquestioned male authority and hegemony			0
but it was always @entity43 who got the last word , who was the only one who could turn to us and speak to us directly			2
she was given that special , powerful voice			0
and in the next episode , @entity43 invariably broke the rules again			1
in the socially and politically tumultuous era of the 1960s , the message of " @entity49 " and " @entity86 " and " @entity115 " and all these shows where the women kept getting in trouble was not that the rules were enforced by these throwback men , but that the women kept breaking them			1
show after show after show , the women kept breaking the rules , testing the limits , crossing the line			2
that was the entire premise , the whole point			0
in the new era , there were strong and sassy women who would make their own rules			2
and we would watch them and fall in love with them and want to be them and find the rules to break in our own lives and in the world around us			0
for women and people of color and gay folks and anyone remotely not @entity174 , the rules of the 1950s were at the very least limiting and in many cases ugly and violent			2
these were rules that needed to be broken			0
" @entity49 " the tv show only lasted for one season , a tragedy from which my little 8 - year - old rerun watching self would never fully recover from all those years later			1
and yet the social , cultural and political changes that 1960s tv women like @entity43 helped both reflect and set in motion --- fortunately , those changes lasted for generations			1

@entity208 : in ' @entity210 , there were @entity7 , @entity40 , perfect housewives
@entity208 : but ' 60s tv *starred* women you might even want to be , like *adventurous* @entity43
@entity208 : women in ' 60s shows like " @entity49 , " " @entity79 , " " @entity92 " broke the rules
she says those characters paved way for the *revolution* to come in women 's roles
