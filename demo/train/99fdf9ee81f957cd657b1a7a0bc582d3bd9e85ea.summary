the family of slain @entity4 hostage @entity2 believes @entity5 paid as much as $ 50,000 to rebels who alerted the militant group that the journalist had entered @entity9 , a spokesman told @entity10			1
the family had learned from " sources on the ground " that a member of a moderate rebel group reached out to @entity5 , @entity11 told @entity10 's " @entity17 " on monday			1
" somebody at the border crossing made a phone call to @entity5 , and they set up a fake checkpoint with many people , " @entity11 said			0
" @entity24 and his people that he went in with could not escape			0
" @entity11 said the tipster was one of " the so - called moderate rebels that people want our administration to support			0
" so how much was the tip worth ? @entity2 's whereabouts were sold for " something between " $ 25,000 and $ 50,000 , @entity11 said			1
' false ' accusations @entity2 , a 31 - year - old freelance journalist , disappeared during a reporting trip to @entity9 in august 2013			1
@entity11 said he last spoke to his friend the day he disappeared			0
" minutes before he was kidnapped , he called me from inside @entity9 to tell me that he was in , " @entity11 said			2
@entity2 was supposedly turned over because his name was on a list of people responsible for a hospital bombing , his friend said			2
activists spread his name around , " @entity11 told @entity17			0
in fact , " @entity24 loved the @entity48 and @entity49 world , and he wanted to bring their suffering to the world stage , " @entity11 said			0
" he believed that everybody was created equal , and the people in the @entity48 and @entity49 world were n't terrorists , they were just people like you and me			0
" who might have sold @entity2 out ? a senior administration official said there is no evidence to support the notion that @entity2 was in the custody of the moderate @entity9 opposition at any time			1
@entity9 opposition officials , after consulting with their sources and activists on the ground , also deny the story			1
but the @entity9 opposition is made up of some 12 different rebel groups -- some moderate , some extreme , and some in between -- a key reason why @entity4 president @entity77 has resisted arming rebels in any significant way			1
was the beheading preventable ? the gruesome video of an @entity5 militant decapitating @entity2 spurred international outrage at @entity5 , the @entity84 terror group that refers to itself as the @entity85			1
the group is trying to establish strict @entity84 rule over swaths of @entity9 and @entity89 and has captured cities in both countries			2
but that video was n't the first time @entity2 was featured in an @entity5 message			2
@entity2 appeared in the earlier decapitation video of @entity96 , another @entity4 journalist who was beheaded by an @entity5 militant			1
in that video , which was released august 19 , a militant said @entity2 's life depended on what @entity77 did next			1
" once @entity24 appeared in that video , the @entity2 family made one simple request of the administration -- and they were rebuffed on that , " @entity11 told @entity10			1
he declined to elaborate on the request , citing the safety of those who are still being held hostage			0
he said the relationship between the @entity2 family and the @entity112 was " very strained			1
" " we do not believe they gave us the cooperation ( the family needed ) , " he said			0
a senior administration official said @entity4 policy is to use " all of our military , intelligence , law enforcement and diplomatic capabilities to bring @entity4 home safely			0
" while we were not able to bring @entity2 home to his family , that is what we did in his case and what we continue to do in the case of those still being held by ( @entity5 ) and by other groups around the world , " the source said			2
the official said among its efforts , the administration reached out to more than two dozens countries asking for help " from anyone who may have the influence or information that could assist in securing the release of @entity4 citizens behind held hostage in @entity9			2
" but @entity11 also criticized the release of information about an unsuccessful @entity4 commando raid this summer that attempted to free @entity96 , @entity2 and others			2
" we know that the intelligence community and the @entity112 are enmeshed in a larger game of bureaucratic infighting , and @entity153 and @entity24 are pawns in that game			0
and that 's not fair , " @entity11 said			0
" if there continues to be leaks , the @entity2 family will have to speak out to set the record straight			1
" @entity161 spokeswoman @entity160 said the administration is still committed to the cases of @entity2 and @entity96			0
" we understand the very real pain the @entity2 family is feeling at this time			1
our thoughts and prayers are with them as they grieve @entity2 's loss , " @entity160 said			1
" we condemn the murders of @entity2 and @entity170 and we remain committed to bringing the perpetrators of these crimes to justice			0
" up to $ 10 million reward a group of bipartisan senators introduced a bill monday that would authorize up to $ 10 million for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in the @entity96 and @entity2 abductions and beheadings			1
" @entity96 and @entity2 nobly risked their lives in the pursuit of truth , and the @entity4 will not stand idly by after two of its own were brutally murdered at the hands of fundamentally evil and freedom - hating extremists , " sen. @entity184 , @entity185 , said in a statement			2
sen. @entity196 , @entity197 , echoed that sentiment			0
" @entity96 and @entity2 contributed greatly to the world through their reporting , and we must vigorously pursue those responsible for their murders			0

@entity9 opposition officials say the moderate opposition did n't have @entity2
family spokesman : a rebel phoned isis and said @entity2 had entered @entity9
video of @entity2 's beheading came after another @entity4 was decapitated
