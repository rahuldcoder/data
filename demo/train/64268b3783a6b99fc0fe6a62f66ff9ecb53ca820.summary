the damning internal report that effectively ended @entity2 's tumultuous tenure as @entity4 secretary describes in the starkest terms the systemic failures of a system charged with providing medical care to @entity10 's veterans			1
" of the 216 site audit reports , many were flagged for further review because of concerns identified by the site audit team about questionable scheduling practices , signaling a systemic lack of integrity within some @entity21 facilities , " the audit summary says			1
@entity2 went to the @entity22 on friday morning to present @entity23 with the audit findings			1
the first phase of the audit looked at scheduling and access management practices from may 12 to 16 at @entity30 medical centers and large community - based outpatient clinics serving at least 10,000 veterans , the audit says			2
that 's 138 @entity36 medical centers encompassing 216 sites -- a total of 258 separate points of access to medical care and more than 2,100 scheduling staff			1
an additional audit will cover all remaining va facilities -- suggesting that the scandal could grow			1
" suspected willful misconduct will be reported promptly to the @entity48 , " the audit said			0
" where the @entity48 chooses not to immediately investigate , management will launch either a formal fact finding or administrative investigation			0
where misconduct is confirmed , appropriate personnel actions will be pursued promptly			0
" @entity23 on friday announced the resignation of his only @entity30 secretary after meeting with @entity2 to discuss the growing scandal involving long waits for care at @entity36 hospitals			1
calls for @entity2 's resignation increased in recent days from the across the political spectrum -- republicans and @entity63 as well as veterans ' advocacy groups			1
the problems gained prominence after @entity68 began reporting problems at @entity36 facilities in november			2
the audit said it was " a rapidly deployed , systemwide assessment " of scheduling and " not intended as a formal investigation of individual staff or managers			2
" the audit teams were not able to interview all employees , and " time did not allow assessment of intent or potential culpability			0
" the next phase will include smaller clinic sites and anonymous web surveys			0
still , the initial findings were deemed " a strong basis for immediate action , " audit said			0
the findings included : efforts to meet the needs of veterans and clinicians led to an " overly complicated scheduling process that resulted in high potential to create confusion among scheduling clerks and front - line supervisors			0
" meeting a 14 - day wait - time performance target for new appointments was " simply not attainable given the ongoing challenge of finding sufficient provider slots to accommodate a growing demand for services			0
imposing this expectation on the field before ascertaining required resources ... represent an organizational leadership failure			0
" of scheduling staff surveyed , 13 % said they received instruction to enter in the " @entity112 " field a date different from the one requested			0
the survey did not determine whether this was done " through lack of understanding or mal - intent unless it was clearly apparent			0
" in some cases , " pressures were placed on schedulers to utilize inappropriate practices in order to make @entity122 appear more favorable			0
such practices are sufficiently pervasive to require @entity36 re-examine its entire performance management system and , in particular , whether current measures and targets for access are realistic or sufficient			1
" the @entity36 's audit of all remaining sites is scheduled to be completed in early june			1
read the @entity36 audit report part of the review will be to determine how performance goals were conveyed " across the chain of command such that some front - line , middle , and senior managers felt compelled to manipulate @entity36 scheduling processes , " the audit said			1
it added , " the overarching environment and culture which allowed this state of practice to take root must be confronted head - on if @entity36 is to evolve to be more capable of adjusting systems , leadership , and resources to meet the needs of veterans and families			2
it must also be confronted in order to regain the trust of the @entity36 serves			2
" the audit said the @entity36 will " ensure that managers and staff engaging in undesired practices are held accountable			1
" " we do n't have time for distractions , " @entity23 said in announcing @entity2 's resignation			1
" we need to fix the problem			0
" the @entity36 's troubled history what @entity23 is looking for in next @entity36 chief			2

@entity172 audit of what 's happening in @entity36 system effectively ends @entity2 's job
audit cites " questionable scheduling practices " signaling " a systemic lack of integrity "
additional audit will cover all remaining va facilities , suggesting scandal could grow
