-- @entity1 and @entity2 , the former business partners and @entity5 classmates of @entity6 , have dropped their court appeal of a settlement with the @entity10 founder			1
the @entity11 had claimed they were shortchanged in a $ 65 million settlement with @entity6 because @entity10 had misrepresented the value of company stock			1
in april , a federal appeals judge rejected the argument and ruled the twins could not unwind the legally binding agreement they had signed in 2008			1
the brothers and a third partner , @entity20 , had wanted to reverse that ruling and were willing to take the case to the @entity24 @entity23			2
but in documents filed wednesday with the @entity24 9th @entity26 in @entity27 , they said they will not pursue the matter any longer			0
" we 've considered this case closed for a long time , and we 're pleased to see the other party now agrees , " @entity10 spokesman @entity29 said in a statement			1

in late 2003 , the @entity11 and @entity41 asked @entity6 to help them write the coding for a social networking site they were developing for @entity5 and other campuses			2
@entity6 entered into an oral agreement and was made a partner			0
in february 2004 , however , @entity6 launched thefacebook.com , which he later renamed @entity10			0
the @entity11 and @entity41 filed suit later that year against @entity10 and @entity6			2

@entity10 promptly countersued the trio and their own social networking site , @entity54 , alleging they had hacked into @entity10 to steal data and spam users			0
a @entity58 court ordered the parties to mediate the dispute , and according to court records , they signed an agreement in which the @entity11 would give up @entity54 for cash and a share in @entity10 stock			1
the @entity11 and @entity41 later tried to pull out of the deal , alleging that @entity10 had undervalued its stock , thus rendering the agreement as having been procured fraudulently			1
a judge ruled against them and forced the settlement to go through , but the @entity11 and @entity41 appealed in april , @entity24 9th @entity26 chief judge @entity72 , ruled against them			2
