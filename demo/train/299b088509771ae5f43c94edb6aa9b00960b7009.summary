the first time the @entity3 factory owner watched his @entity5 employees nibble on a @entity6 , they appeared shocked -- even overwhelmed			1
he summed up their reaction to the @entity3 snack in one word : " @entity12			1
" much like what twinkies are to @entity18 , @entity3 's @entity13 -- two disc - shaped , chocolate - covered cakes , sandwiching a rubbery layer of marshmallow cream -- are ubiquitous , cost less than 50 cents and are full of empty calories			2
but on the other side of the @entity5 border , the snacks are viewed as exotic , highly prized treats , selling on @entity5 's black markets for as much as $ 10 , according to analysts			2
their rising popularity in the north reveals an unexpected common ground between the two @entity30 , despite their fractious relationship -- a shared sweet tooth			0
this month , an art exhibition called " the @entity6 - ization of @entity5 " opened in @entity35 , exploring the symbolism of the treat			1
the high value in @entity5 of the @entity6 , something considered so widespread and mundane in @entity3 , is " a sad tragic story , " said the artist , @entity41			1
@entity41 smeared melted chocolate across the @entity5 newspaper @entity44 , staining the state - run propaganda with something sweet			2
she used the chocolate to make a symbol of @entity6 , written in the lettering style of @entity51			2
her exhibit , displayed at @entity53 , also contains piles of @entity13 as well as a gold - plated one			0
" through this @entity6 , i found the potential from chocolate as an object that changes a society , " @entity41 said			2
the @entity6 represents something more than just a treat			2
@entity62 and @entity63 ? despite perceptions of @entity5 as brainwashed , insulated masses , the hunger and desire for @entity6 shows that " complete quarantine is impossible , " wrote @entity68 in @entity69			1
@entity71 wrote that it " reveals a susceptibility to outside influence in a society commonly regarded as impenetrable			0
" the crumbly mass of chocolate and marshmallow had taken on a subversive aspect			0
indeed , @entity41 , the artist behind the exhibit , says , the @entity6 " has a power in how it works as a mind changing tool between @entity3 and @entity5			1
" the @entity3 factory owner , who introduced his @entity5 workers to @entity13 , washed down with a @entity51 , said the products seemed to leave an impression on his staff			1
" it was clear that the workers had gotten at least some idea of capitalism and that it was n't all bad , " he told @entity90			0
" they had only associated the @entity18 with evil , and the fact that they could love something that the @entity18 had produced -- specifically @entity51 -- was an eye - opener			0
" @entity62 trade the factory owner , who did not wish to be named , operated his business for seven years at the @entity104 , one of the key symbols of cooperation between @entity108 , and the site through which @entity13 trickled into @entity5			1
at the complex , more than 100 @entity3 factory owners employ about 50,000 @entity5 laborers to manufacture products like clothing and shoes			1
@entity104 , considered to be an important source of hard currency for @entity5 leader @entity120 's regime , sits just a few kilometers north of the @entity121 , which divides the two @entity30			1
it re-opened in september after a five - month hiatus			0
" it 's really the only one place where @entity5 and @entity3 come in regular contact together , " said @entity124 , senior vice president of the @entity125 , in @entity35			1
while workers at @entity104 brought their own rice , the @entity3 factory owners provided them with soup and snacks , said the factory owner who spoke to @entity90			1
" the snacks were necessary because the workers were walking to work often for hours , because there were no buses and they became very hungry as they were working , " he said			0
@entity6 and @entity51 were the standard snacks with other @entity3 managers at @entity104			1
they provided two @entity13 a day , because " otherwise , ( the workers ) would not have energy to sustain themselves at work , " he said			0
but he and fellow @entity3 managers also noticed a conspicuous lack of @entity6 wrappers at the factory			1
" it became clear that the workers were hiding them and taking them home to give them to their children , " he said			0
@entity62 's value the snacks spread to @entity5 's informal markets , valued in the marketplace as about $ 10 in purchasing power , and holding something of a sweet spot for @entity5 , said @entity124			2
" it 's sentimental role , " @entity124 said			0
" it 's given by @entity3			2
it 's a @entity3 product			2
" the @entity13 have even been sent in balloon launches to @entity5 by some advocacy groups			0
but @entity168 , a prominent @entity5 defector who regularly sends leaflets and supplies from @entity3 , said the @entity13 are not ideal for the balloons , because they weigh too much and crumble			1
@entity168 says he prefers to send u.s. $ 1 bills , vitamins and information through usb drives			0
@entity62 replaced at @entity104 , the @entity3 factory owners eventually switched from @entity13 to cup noodles -- " in order to provide a more substantial snack , " the former factory owner told @entity90			1
the change , he said , was well - received			0
one of the most surprising things he remembered from his years at the factory was how @entity5 workers were mystified by everyday items			1
the workers had no idea how to use a @entity192 - style toilet , and had never seen toilet paper before , he said			0
he has since pulled out of @entity104			0
through all the stories about noise and misinformation about @entity5 , perhaps the @entity6 is a reminder of an aspect missing in the narratives about the country , said @entity124			1
" we lose sight of the fact there 's a common human experience			0
we need to realize @entity5 are regular human beings -- that 99 % of @entity5 just desire a better life			0
" " they want a @entity208			0
