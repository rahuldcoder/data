@entity1 needs to keep actively guarding its sovereignty to avoid becoming like a chained bear whose captors " will pull out his teeth and claws , " president @entity0 said thursday			1
responding to a question at his annual news conference about @entity1 's annexation of @entity12 , @entity0 drew an analogy with what would happen if " our most recognizable symbol ... the bear who guards his @entity20 ( forest ) " stopped chasing pigs and sat still , " maybe eating berries and honey			1
" the president pondered whether the bear would then be left alone before answering : " they wo n't leave him alone			2
they are always trying to put him on a chain			0
they will always try to put him on a chain and as soon as he is put on this chain , they will pull out his teeth and claws			2
in today 's terms we are speaking about our nuclear deterrence			0
as soon as , @entity40 forbid , this is done , the bear is n't needed anymore			0
" once the bear had lost his teeth it might then be stuffed , he concluded			2
@entity0 told reporters gathered in @entity45 that his country was ready to mediate in the @entity48 crisis , and he denied that @entity1 killed in @entity48 were members of his country 's military			1
western powers accuse @entity1 of sending troops and equipment to help separatists in eastern @entity48 in their fight against @entity48 government forces			1
in april , violence broke out in two @entity48 regions that border @entity1 -- @entity59 and @entity60 -- as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in @entity64			1
@entity45 has voiced moral support for the rebels and sent aid convoys into the region , but it has repeatedly denied military involvement			2
in his end - of - year news conference , @entity0 said there had been " a state coup and a military coup " in @entity48 with which parts of that country had not agreed			1
he repeated the long - standing @entity1 line that any @entity1 killed in @entity48 were volunteers			1
@entity0 said he hoped the situation would still be solved through dialogue rather than military means or economic blockades that were " harmful to the state of @entity48 , the people of @entity48			1
" " the @entity48 crisis must be solved , and the quicker the better , " he said			1
a ceasefire deal was reached september 5 in @entity85 , @entity86 , after talks between representatives of @entity48 's government , @entity1 and rebel leaders in eastern @entity48			1
a subsequent agreement on september 19 in @entity85 set out more measures			0
but fighting in @entity48 has since resumed , with a @entity94 security official last month telling @entity95 that the conflict had returned to levels that preceded the ceasefire			2
@entity48 president @entity101 " is striving towards a settlement of the @entity85 agreement , " @entity0 said			1
" our representatives in @entity85 signed a memorandum , and the representatives of @entity59 did not sign that protocol -- that is what it 's about			0
" " the @entity48 officials are not removing their troops from the @entity59 airport -- they are sitting there , " @entity0 told reporters			1
" the next step should be following up the @entity85 agreement -- it is important that the @entity64 authorities use all these agreements , " he said			0
but he also said that if @entity48 wanted to restore its territorial integrity , " it has to be open and honest			2
" ' we 're not attacking anyone ' asked whether its economic problems were the price to pay for annexing @entity12 , @entity0 said @entity1 was trying to maintain its sovereignty and independence			1
he said @entity1 's economic woes were partially due to sanctions imposed against it			1
earlier , @entity0 said " external economic factors " provoked @entity1 's current situation			1
he cited oil prices , and he praised the @entity133 's intervention this week to defend the ruble			0
asked to comment on suspicions in the @entity136 that he was returning @entity1 to a @entity138 footing , @entity0 denied that his country was an aggressor			1
" as far as our maneuvers and exercises of the military are concerned , you 're saying that @entity1 has made a big contribution to the tensions in the world , " he responded			2
" @entity1 has only made a contribution where it is supporting its national interests			2
we 're not attacking anyone ; we 're not warmongers			0
" @entity0 said @entity1 had stopped sending its aircraft on strategic flights in the 1990s and only resumed them in the last two or three years			1
the @entity156 , he said , has continued its strategic flights despite the end of the @entity138			0
furthermore , @entity1 has two military bases abroad			0
" the @entity156 bases are throughout the globe , and you want to say we are the aggressors ? " he said			0
in addition , @entity0 said the @entity166 's defense budget was " virtually 10 times more " than @entity1 's			1
" are we extending the borders ? who is moving the borders of @entity171 forward -- the military infrastructure ? not us , " the @entity1 president said			1
@entity0 added that @entity1 had not been the country to establish a missile defense system			1
" who were the ones who wanted to set up this system of global security ? it was not us			0
this is a threat for us , " he said			0
" in @entity184 and @entity185 -- right next to us -- and you are saying we are carrying out this policy			0
" he said @entity1 wanted to develop normal international relations and work as a partner in the areas of security and combating terror , drugs , crime and infectious diseases such as @entity195			0
as @entity0 spoke , the @entity196 announced that further sanctions had been approved against @entity12 and @entity198			2
" this is to reinforce the @entity201 's policy of not recognizing their illegal annexation by @entity1 and follows a conclusion by the @entity204 of 17 november , " it said in a statement			2
the measures would be applied starting saturday , the @entity201 said			0
' we will get through this period ' in the final question of the more than three - hour conference , @entity0 was asked whether he took personal responsibility for @entity1 's economic issues and if he would stand in the 2018 presidential elections			1
he replied that it was too early to make a decision on running and said the economic responsibility was " nothing i can take on alone , and i do n't plan to			0
" @entity0 pointed to the " responsibility of the central bank and different government bodies for the results of the work of each department for which they have responsibility			0
" he ended the conference on a positive note : " we will get through this period			0
it 's not easy , of course , but we will strengthen our position in the world economy , " he said			0
" the most important thing is to ensure social prosperity of people despite the cuts in income , the budget			0
and we can do that , we absolutely can			0

@entity0 *compares* @entity1 to a bear trying to protect its forest
@entity0 says if the bear rests , it will have its teeth and claws pulled out
at year - end news conference , he said sanctions were behind some of @entity1 's woes
