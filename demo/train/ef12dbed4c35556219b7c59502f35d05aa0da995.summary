-- over the decades , i 've interviewed dozens of automotive engineers ; engine engineers , transmission engineers , chemical engineers , tire engineers , etc. but never have i interviewed an engineer quite like @entity9 's @entity8			1
@entity8 has been with the @entity9 for 12 years			1
what separates @entity14 ( what she prefers to be called at work ) from other engineers is that it seems as though she was born be where she is today ; the vehicle dynamics development engineer of the @entity18			2
the @entity18 goes on sale this summer , and it is arguably the most important vehicle @entity9 announces this year			1
this thirty - something @entity22 is the only woman at @entity9 to have achieved her status as a vehicle dynamics development engineer			1
the job is equal parts engineer , race driver and vehicle psychologist			1
" as an engineer , i need to make sure the car is safe , " @entity8 said			1
" as a ( race ) driver i have to make sure the car handles well			1
and then i have to tune the car to have the right personality for being the latest @entity9			1
" @entity36 autos : best sedans under $ 30k she goes on to define what how cars exhibit personality			0
" some cars have a more relaxed personality , so everything about the way they drive is soft and slower to react , " she said			0
" @entity9 have a dna that is sportier , more fun to drive , more responsive , more alive , so they need to feel that way			1
" you 'll be able to tell whether @entity8 has done her job well when you get behind the wheel of the new @entity53			1
while we did n't get to drive the new @entity53 , we did get an opportunity to ride in the high - performance @entity18 model at @entity9 's @entity58 , @entity60 proving grounds ( a special test track for developing new cars and trucks )			1
more on that experience later			0
@entity36 autos : best and worst automotive designs preparing for success @entity8 told us about her background in the automotive business			1
" i 've grown into this job because @entity9 's engineering group works on a model that emphasizes ' technical maturity			1
' " @entity0 : first drive of the 2010 @entity76 for @entity8 , this means that because she first possessed the technical background for the job , she was then able to develop and prove her practical skills on her way to becoming one of the company 's most influential engineers			1
she 's been with @entity9 12 years			1
matter - of - factly , @entity8 elaborates			1
" in this job , your body has to become a precisely calibrated instrument that can understand what the car 's mechanicals are doing , " she said			1
" it takes a while to tune your body , but i 've been working on this particular chassis for eight years , so i really know what it 's capable of and how to make it respond			1
" while the @entity100 is an all - new vehicle , it is related to other @entity9 products ( the @entity103 , @entity104 , and the outgoing @entity105 / @entity18 )			2
@entity8 also contributed to the ride and handling on those vehicles , a task that began with the @entity105 back in 2001			1
born to @entity110 parents who fled @entity112 's communist regime , @entity8 grew up in @entity22			1
" i learned to be a methodical thinker from my father , who was a chemical engineer , " she said			2
" but it was my mother who was the mechanical one			0
she encouraged me when i was growing up to figure out how things worked , and she never got too mad at me when i put things back together and still had a few pieces left over			1
" while @entity8 worked on her motor skills , another aspect of her life laid groundwork for her future success			2
" i come from a very athletic family , " she said			0
" my grandfathers and uncles played @entity130 basketball , so we were always active			0
i can remember that when my brother enrolled in little league baseball , he did n't want to join without a friend , so my mother enrolled me with him			0
i was the only girl in the league			0
" we doubt @entity8 throws like a girl			2
and if you thought we 'd make a joke about her driving like a woman ? think again			0
we doubt anyone could keep up with her on a track , male or female			0
regarding her education , her bachelors in engineering came from @entity148			0
she also earned a masters from the @entity150 in @entity151			0
mechanical engineering is a heavily male - dominated career path , but this has n't slowed @entity8 's progress			1
it is obvious that @entity8 knows how to operate with the guys , without becoming one of the guys			2
certainly , @entity8 does n't look like a mechanical engineer : pocket protectors and out - of - style glasses do n't seem to be part of her wardrobe			1
actually , she looks like she could be @entity166 driver @entity165 's sister			2
this comparison is fitting given the ride we were about to experience			0
spicing up the bull @entity8 explained the process used to give a car a dynamic personality			1
" first , we start with models generated by @entity176 , " she said			0
" these give us starting points for ( suspension ) spring rates , dampers , bar thicknesses , etc. after that , everything we do is by the seat of the pants			0
that 's why it 's so important to have a feel for what 's happening at the road , because you end up becoming a cook who is perfecting a recipe by trial and error			2
we add more of this or take away some of that			0
each change is designed to wake you up and make you feel alive behind the wheel , just like eating a great meal			2
" @entity0 : 2009 best looking cars the 2010 @entity18 has four distinct suspension calibrations ; they are mechanical recipes , if you will			2
there 's one each for the front - wheel - drive @entity53 , the all - wheel - drive @entity18 , the all - wheel - drive high - performance sho and the ultimate sho fitted with the performance package			1
@entity8 noted that each model has unique suspension calibrations that are based on the specific model 's equipment and personality			1
for example , the two @entity53 models must have the same feel even though one carries the additional weight of the all - wheel - drive system			2
" the @entity18 needs to be comfortably engaging , " she said			0
" it ca n't be stiff like a ( @entity223 ) @entity222 , but it also ca n't be too soft like a @entity224			0
we wanted to keep most of the suppleness of the @entity103 sedan , but make it more responsive			0
" @entity36 autos : first drive of the 2010 @entity231 the move from the regular @entity53 to the sho edition is dramatic			1
this is where about 10 - percent more chili powder and cayenne pepper get added to the recipe			0
nearly every tunable suspension component is changed between the base model and the @entity18 , resulting in a much more dynamic drive			0
the step up from the sho to the sho with the @entity243 tightens everything even further ( more chilies ) , including another 20 - percent on the dampers ( those would be struts and shock absorbers to non-engineers ) , then 9 - percent stiffer rear springs , and a thicker rear anti-roll bar			0
these changes make the most performance - oriented sho a more neutral handling car that drivers should find exceptionally agile and immediately responsive			2
riding shotgun in the @entity18 @entity8 was only too willing to take us for a ride to demonstrate what she had been talking about , " this car is really my pride and joy			1
i think you 're going to like it			0
" with that , she moved the floor - shifter into @entity268 mode and took off			0
riding along in the passenger seat , we could n't help but feel how effortlessly the twin - turbocharged ecoboost engine took the full - size @entity53 well above legal speeds			2
unlike turbocharged cars from decades past , the @entity18 did not seem to exhibit any turbo lag			0
and the turbochargers sounded quiet ( no turbo whine or unrefined popping and hissing )			0
the @entity278 is efficient , too , although @entity280 numbers are n't yet available			0
from where we sat , the ride was firm but not harsh , even as @entity14 drove us over test roads that were intentionally bumpy and pocked			0
by far , the most fun was riding along on the handling course			0
this smooth , serpentine ribbon features undulating hills and off - camber curves			0
normally , one would n't expect a full - size car to be at home here			0
the steering would be too slow and the handing ponderous			0
we were n't behind the wheel , but we got the impression that the @entity18 is no traditional full - size car			0
the @entity18 's heavy - duty six - speed gearbox felt quick and smooth from a passenger 's perspective , and as @entity8 increased engine speed , the growl came from under the hood , not the exhaust			1
@entity8 confirmed that the turbochargers absorb much of the exhaust noise			2
the faster @entity8 drove , the smaller the @entity18 seemed to get , easily carving lines between and through the corners			2
the roll of the body felt well controlled from a passenger 's perspective , and it never wallowed			2
watching @entity8 dial in the steering , the car felt like it responded quickly and directly			1
compared to an all - wheel - drive @entity18 , the @entity18 's unit gets unique tuning with a greater power bias to the rear wheels for a more balanced feel , and the car seemed to rotate around the corners effortlessly			2
we ca n't wait to get behind the wheel ourselves later this spring , when we 'll provide a full road test			0
" after doing this for 12 years , " @entity8 said			2
" i know what a car should feel like , and i do n't get questioned anymore , " @entity8 said			1
in other words , @entity8 earned the respect of other engineers , making it completely understandable why @entity9 would trust her to tune the ride of this very important new car			1
after about 30 minutes of trashing around @entity9 's @entity58 proving grounds , @entity333 aptly demonstrated that she and the team she 's part of knows how to dial in the suspension of a performance car			1
as she pressed the @entity339 on the @entity18 's dash , @entity8 said , " i think i 've got the best job at @entity9			1
" we 'd agree .			0

@entity9 's @entity8 is an engineer and race car driver
as child , she took things apart , put them back together , some parts left over
@entity8 designed @entity53 2010 , one of @entity9 's most important vehicles
your body has to be precisely calibrated instrument to understand car 's mechanicals
