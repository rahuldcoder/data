@entity1 officials say they have specific reasons to worry about security in @entity4 , only three days before the @entity5 are set to open in the @entity7 city			1
speaking at a @entity11 hearing on tuesday , @entity8 , director of the @entity9 , highlighted concern over the @entity5 and whether @entity14 fundamentalists in disputed regions of @entity7 -- or other groups -- could launch deadly attacks on selected targets			1

" and we 're working very closely with the @entity7 and with other partners to monitor any threats we see and to disrupt those			2
" @entity7 security forces have cracked down on suspected militants in the restive @entity29 republic of @entity30 and elsewhere in recent weeks after twin suicide bombings in the city of @entity33 in december			2
" the primary threat , from a terrorism perspective , comes from @entity36 , probably the most prominent terrorist group in @entity7			2
it 's made its intent clear to seek to carry out attacks in the run - up to the @entity5 , " said @entity38			2
" we think the greater danger from a terrorist perspective is in potential for attacks to occur outside of the actual venues for the @entity5 themselves in the area surrounding @entity4 or outside of @entity4 in the region			1
" his comments were echoed by @entity1 rep. @entity52 , chairman of the @entity11 , who spoke to @entity54 's " @entity53 " tuesday night			1
" i think the venues themselves will be ok			0
the @entity7 have done a lot of guards , gates and guns to try to secure the venues and try to get a ring around the @entity5			1
i 'm very concerned by the sheer level of attention and effort , not just from @entity66 and folks in that region , but outside of that region that have expressed an interest in actually having a violent act occur at the @entity5			2
" he complained about cooperation issues			0
" they 're not at 100 %			0
they really should be when it comes to peoples ' lives at the @entity5 , and we know that it 's such a high - threat environment , " said @entity52 , @entity75			2

@entity96 threatened @entity1 are n't the only ones worried about security			2

the costs of the @entity91 " do not exceed previous @entity5 , " he said			0
" to transform a little bit old - fashioned summer resort into a modern , year - round sport and tourist destination -- you can see this transformation -- these are not @entity5 costs			0
this is the transformation of a whole region , and the @entity5 serve as a catalyst for this kind of development			0
" @entity7 deputy prime minister @entity180 last year put the total cost at $ 51 billion , which would make the @entity91 the most expensive ever held			0
