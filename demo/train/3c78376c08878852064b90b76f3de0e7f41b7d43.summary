@entity0 -- in the midst of the ongoing culture wars , can it be a good idea to put out a comedy about two @entity7 men who wander into the @entity8 ? in " @entity9 , " @entity11 stars as an inquisitive @entity7 man , with @entity13 as his sidekick			1
" @entity9 , " which he directed , concerns two men -- played by @entity11 and @entity13 -- who leave their home and , in their travels , meet biblical characters such as @entity20 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
among the locales : ancient @entity24 , which " did n't seem worse than @entity25 to me , " @entity15 told @entity1			1
" @entity9 " comes out friday			1
@entity15 , whose writing and directing credits include " @entity29 " and " @entity30 , " said it was time for a new biblical epic -- of sorts			1
" no one had done this film for our generation , " he told @entity1			2
it 's like , you know , when ' @entity41 ' [ which @entity15 co-wrote ] came out , there were college films			1
every generation had college films , but our generation did n't have one yet , and i do n't know that our generation - this young , new generation of kids has a , you know , a sandal epic yet , and this is the one			2
" @entity15 rounded up a cast of comedians familiar to any watcher of @entity57 - produced movies -- no surprise , since @entity57 is a producer of " @entity9			1
" @entity59 ( " @entity62 " ) , @entity60 ( " @entity63 , " " @entity64 " ) and @entity61 ( " @entity65 " ) all have parts			0
" a lot of them were new to me , " said @entity15			1
" [ but ] @entity11 knew them , @entity13 knew them , they were connected -- all connected through @entity57 , through ' @entity63 ' ... the comedy world is a club			1
" @entity11 joked that everyone 's a member of a secret society , requiring retinal scans , that meets " inside the o of the @entity80 sign -- the first o , " he noted			2
. " all the projects are laid out on a table , " he said			0
" and we talk generally about how we 're gon na take over the planet , take over the comedy and keep a vise grip on it			2
" @entity11 said he revels in the chance to find the humor in the @entity8			1
" that was the fun of this thing , " he said			0
" it 's like , we are going to have some fun with the @entity8 ; you do n't see it very often			2
it has n't really been done since @entity98 days			0
' " however , the film could get more than it asked for			2
films poking fun at the @entity8 -- or , indeed , treating the @entity8 with anything less than reverence -- have been the subject of protests and criticism			1
" @entity99 , " the @entity98 troupe 's 1979 comedy about an assumed messiah that parodied the story of @entity112 , was protested by clergy in the @entity114 and banned outright in @entity115			2
@entity117 protesters threw @entity119 cocktails into a @entity121 theater showing " @entity122 , " @entity124 's 1988 film version of @entity126 ' novel			2
more recently , @entity131 's " @entity130 , " though a huge financial success , was criticized by some observers for alleged anti-semitism , as well as its violence			0
@entity15 , who observed that a number of biblical films focus on the @entity135 , said he deliberately chose to make the @entity136 his subject			1
" i told people that i wanted to do for the @entity136 what @entity98 did for the @entity140 , " he said			0
" which is just to kind of take a funny look and project a contemporary sensibility back to these treasured myths of @entity146 civilization			0
" it was n't so much to attack any particular religion , " he added			0
" i figure all religions are good			0
they all make sense on paper ; it 's just the exploitation of religion that 's been a problem , by ... people using religion to justify war , or to justify government or , you know , ' @entity159 made me do it			0
' " @entity15 said one of his intentions with " @entity9 , " which he co-wrote with " @entity166 " writers @entity164 and @entity165 , was to focus on people , not @entity159			1
paraphrasing the liberal clergyman and activist @entity168 , he said , @entity159 's not the event itself , but " @entity159 's in our reaction to the event			0
" " i wanted to do a film that kind of addressed these fundamental beliefs and urged people to take personal responsibility , no matter what they believe @entity159 is or is n't , " @entity15 said			1
" it 's still up to us in the final analysis			0
" which is not to say that the film skimps on its comedy -- and with @entity15 , @entity11 , @entity13 , @entity186 , @entity187 and producer @entity57 ( " the 40 - year - old @entity188 , " " @entity62 " ) around , there 's no shortage of jokes			1
" it 's really just a good , dumb , broad comedy , " @entity15 told @entity192			1
improvisation often played a role , said @entity13 and @entity11			1
" we were n't locked to anything , " @entity13 said			2
" it was a very honest set			0
if something was n't working then we would address it			0
" " we got a lot of different options [ from observers ] , and they were able to play with different options in the editing room			0
i thought it was a cool way to do it , " said @entity11			2
" i 've never done a movie like that -- and now i wan na do that on all my movies			0
" ireport.com : seen " @entity9 " ? share your review the handful of early reviews have been positive , and @entity15 is pleased with the result			1
he 's particularly happy the film was received warmly in the @entity24 shooting location -- @entity221 , located in northwest @entity222 , in the heart of the @entity224			0
" it 's funny , because @entity228 people living in the heart of the bible belt , there 's a baptist church every 150 feet in that area , and here we are in @entity24 , in the city of @entity24 , " he said			0
" and they just got into it , they enjoyed it so much			0

" @entity9 " stars @entity11 and @entity13 as @entity7 men in @entity8
director and *co-writer* @entity15 says the film uses comedy to make points
biblical films are sometimes met with protest ; will " @entity9 " *qualify* ?
