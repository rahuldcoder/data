@entity0 -- the @entity2 dealt federal prosecutors dual setbacks monday in efforts to prosecute the laundering of drug ring and organized crime profits			1
the @entity2 considered a pair of cases involving hidden money and an illegal gambling ring			1
the justices ruled that merely hiding money headed out of the @entity15 is not proof of money laundering			1
justices also concluded that prosecutors had to prove that an illegal gambling ring had laundered profits of its betting , rather than just proceeds			1
in a unanimous ruling , the justices overturned the federal conviction of @entity24 , who had run afoul of the " transportation " part of the international money - laundering law when his car was stopped by a deputy sheriff near @entity30 , @entity31			2
inside the car , officers found nearly $ 81,000 in cash wrapped in duct - taped bundles and hidden in a secret compartment covered with animal hair , presumably to trick drug - sniffing dogs			2
police suspected the money came from drug trafficking and arrested @entity24 , who had been heading for @entity42 when he was stopped			0
@entity24 was convicted and sentenced to 78 months in prison			0
federal law requires proof the transportation was " designed to conceal or disguise the nature , location , the source , the ownership , or the control " of the money			0
writing for the high court , justice @entity53 said prosecutors failed to prove the reason for moving the money across the border was to hide its source , as part of an alleged international drug ring			1
" although the evidence suggested @entity24 's transportation would have the effect of concealing funds , the evidence did not demonstrate that such concealment was the purpose of the transportation " @entity53 wrote			0
@entity69 passed a law in 1986 designed to prevent the laundering , or " washing , " of criminal funds through legitimate enterprises and overseas bank accounts			0
in the other case , the high court split 5 - 4 in concluding that prosecutors failed to show money used to pay couriers in alleged gambling operation were " profits , " rather than " gross proceeds			1
" the case involved @entity85 and @entity86 , convicted of running an illegal lottery in @entity88 since the 1970s			1
@entity85 allegedly used a network of " runners " and " collectors " to run the enterprise , and @entity86 was a collector who gathered money from the runners and delivered it to @entity85			0
" the money laundering charges brought against @entity85 were based on his payments to the lottery winners and his employees , and the money laundering charge brought against @entity86 was based on his receipt of payments as an employer , " justice @entity95 wrote in a very narrow opinion			1
" neither type of transaction can fairly be characterized as involving the lottery 's profits , " @entity95 added			2
" indeed , the government did not try to prove , and the defendants have not admitted , that they laundered criminal profits			2
" @entity95 noted the high court 's ruling would not overly burden prosecutors , saying only one instance of " profitability " would be required to prove money laundering			1
" what counts is whether the receipts from the charged unlawful act exceeded the costs fairly attributable to it , " he said , adding the government " exaggerates " the difficulty it would have to do that			0
although @entity95 wrote the main ruling , it was justice @entity128 who provided the critical fifth vote for a majority , and his concurring views will probably provide the controlling opinion to guide lower courts in similar cases down the road			0
@entity128 did not go as far as @entity95 wanted , saying @entity69 failed by writing an " ambiguous " law that only confused judges			0
he said lawmakers seemed to want a broader interpretation of " proceeds " as the term applied to money laundering			2
justices @entity144 , @entity146 , @entity147 , and chief justice @entity148 dissented .			0

in one case , court rules that hiding money not same as money laundering
in another , justices say prosecutors have to prove gambling ring laundered " profits "
cases involved cash hidden in car , illegal @entity88 lottery
