rep. @entity0 concludes that 50 years after president @entity1 launched the @entity2 , a pathway out of poverty has become a patchwork of bureaucratic challenges			1
the @entity8 @entity7 has zeroed in on the subject in a comprehensive analysis that points to repetition and inefficiencies in federal poverty programs			2
@entity0 , chairman of the @entity14 and a possible 2016 presidential candidate , released the 204 - page report one day before president @entity17 was due to unveil his budget blueprint for the next fiscal year			1
read the report @entity17 aims to ignite a conversation about federal safety net spending			1
fifteen percent of @entity23 , nearly 50 million people , live in poverty			0
@entity0 's report questions the size and scope of the government 's effort to tackle poverty			1
it says 92 federal programs geared for low - income people cost $ 799 billion per year			1
" for too long , we have measured compassion by how much we spend instead of how many people get out of poverty , " @entity0 wrote said in a statement			1
" we need to take a hard look at what the federal government is doing and ask , ' is this working ? ' " considered a @entity7 policy visionary , the 2012 @entity7 vice presidential nominee released the report amid a listening and learning tour of low - income neighborhoods that began 18 months ago after president @entity17 was reelected			1
@entity0 toured struggling neighborhoods with @entity47 , the head of the @entity48 , an organization that works with disenfranchised people			1
in an interview with @entity51 in december , @entity47 applauded @entity0 's efforts because before he could write policy , he " needs to understand what the needs are			1
" the political war on poverty @entity0 's report is highly critical of many of the programs , saying they contribute to the " poverty trap			1
" because " benefits decline as recipients make more money - poor families face very high implicit marginal tax rates			0
the federal government effectively discourages them from making more money , " the report says			0
it does not detail any solutions or alternatives ; it identifies the programs , their cost and cites reports and studies on each program , with many concluding that the programs due more harm than good			0
for instance , in his analysis of the social security insurance program for disabled , @entity0 points to a report that says : " at age 18 , approximately two - thirds of beneficiaries remain on adult @entity83 benefits			1
" but not all of the reports he cites give negative reviews			0
for instance , @entity0 cited numerous reports analyzing assistance for low - income families for child care found the program was effective in helping women enter the work force or enroll in education or job training programs			1
@entity0 welcomes @entity104 's welfare debate " this report will help start the conversation			1
it shows that some programs work ; others do n't			0
and for many of them , we just do n't know , " @entity0 said			0
the report comes as @entity17 has amplified the issue of the growing wage gap between the rich and the poor , making income inequality a signature theme for this year that includes lifting the minimum wage			1
@entity0 , who is a vocal advocate of a smaller government , has already met intense skepticism			2
this report is just a rehash of a failed economic agenda that @entity23 keep rejecting , " @entity122 spokesman @entity123 said in a statement			0
" republicans just do n't get it			0
their plan is to block a minimum wage increase , cut access to higher education , slash early childhood programs , voucherize @entity134 and shred the social safety net â € ” a safety net that lifted 45 million @entity23 out of poverty in 2012 alone			2
" when he proposed reforms to @entity140 , @entity134 and @entity141 in 2010 , he took immediate flak from @entity17 and @entity143 who said he wanted to dismantle the big - ticket entitlements			2
the report was laced with partisan political ideas			0
for instance , it identified " the breakdown of family " as a main cause of poverty - a common @entity7 talking point that rankles @entity143			0
dr. @entity155 , director of the @entity156 and associate professor at @entity158 , said she is pleased @entity0 " ignites a new conversation " about poverty			2
but she said that some of the evidence he cites in his report , especially regarding food stamps and other nutrition assistance programs , is selective and incomplete			0
" it would get an ' f ' in my master 's classes , " she said			0
since the presidential election when @entity171 came under fire for his " 47 % " comments , saying nearly half of all @entity23 think the government should provide for them , some high profile @entity7 have tried to take up the mantle of poverty reduction			2
@entity178 , president of the @entity180 conservative think tank who has worked with @entity0 on the issue of poverty , said the congressman 's involvement in the issue " really signals that this is a priority for conservative politicians today			1
" @entity189 sen. @entity0 , a @entity189 @entity7 , has proposed " economic freedom zones " and traveled to struggling cities to talk about them			0
even sen. @entity193 , a @entity194 @entity7 , unveiled an anti-poverty agenda in early january			0
@entity0 fights for felon voting rights " the truth is , that by any estimation , things have gotten worse for poor people			2
it 's appropriate for the ( @entity7 ) opposition to say , ' what do we have that 's better ? ' " @entity178 said			0
@entity0 is expected to continue the conversation and will likely have " more to say in this area " later this year , an aide said .			2
