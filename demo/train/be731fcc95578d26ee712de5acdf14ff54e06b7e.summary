-- the special court trying to bring the killers of former @entity4 prime minister @entity3 to justice published wednesday previously secret details of the case against four men it has charged			1
prosecutors assert that the ringleader of the group had earlier been sentenced to death in @entity14 over the 1983 bombings of the @entity17 and @entity18 embassies there			1
the suspect , @entity20 , escaped from prison in 1990 when @entity23 's forces invaded @entity14 , the tribunal says in the indictment			1
he and three other men were indicted by the @entity27 - backed @entity26 in june , and their identities and the charges against them were made public last month			1
but they remain at - large			1
the tribunal says it asked @entity4 authorities on june 30 to arrest @entity20 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
as of august 9 , there had been no progress , the court said wednesday			0
the four are accused of involvement in the bombing that ripped apart @entity3 's armored car in @entity43 on february 14 , 2005			2
it destroyed his motorcade , killing him and 21 others , and injuring 231 people			0
@entity20 was the ringleader , prosecutors charge			2
@entity33 was the head of what they call the " assassination team , " and @entity34 and @entity53 were involved in planting a false claim of responsibility in the media , prosecutors say			0
they add that all four are supporters of @entity58 , the @entity59 militant group , and that @entity60 and @entity33 are related to one of its founders			0
in a speech , @entity58 leader @entity64 said the indictment contained " no direct evidence " against the men			1
" the text ( of the indictment ) is based on circumstantial evidence whose credibility is contested , " he said			1
" this makes us more convinced that what is happening is highly unjust and politicized , and this is unfair to the suspects			2
" investigators pieced together a timeline of the assassination plot dating back at least as far as november 11 , 2004 , based on cell phone data			1
they identified five networks of cell phones , including one they claim was used by the assassination team			2
prosecutors label that the " @entity88			0
" a " @entity95 " was used by leaders of the operation , with the last call between phones in that group made about an hour before the blast			0
prosecutors assume that that 14 - second last call was final authorization for the attack to go ahead			2
the last call on the @entity88 was made about five minutes before the explosion , prosecutors allege			0
cell phone data suggests that @entity3 had been under surveillance for at least 15 days before he was killed			1
it also places @entity33 in the location where the vehicle used in the bombing was bought , the indictment says			1
prosecutors concede in the indictment that the charges are based heavily on circumstantial evidence , but they argue that such information " can be stronger than direct evidence " because it does not rely on things like potentially faulty witness accounts			1
@entity3 's supporters say the businessman - turned - politician was killed because of his opposition to @entity121 's long - time military presence in his country , and his death led to popular protests , nicknamed the " @entity125 , " that led @entity126 to withdraw its troops			1
@entity121 has denied accusations that it was behind the bombing			0
the special tribunal 's prosecutor welcomed the publishing of previously confidential parts of the indictment			2
unsealing the indictment " answers many questions about the 14 february 2005 attack , " @entity135 said in a statement			0
" the full story will however only unfold in the courtroom , where an open , public , fair and transparent trial will render a final verdict			0
" judge @entity144 , the president of the @entity26 , last week publicly urged the suspects to cooperate			0
he said in an open letter to the four men that they will be treated fairly if they appear before the court or participate in the trial proceedings without being present			0
@entity144 issued the statement after @entity4 authorities told him they had been unable to serve the accused warrants and arrest them			1
in @entity155 , the @entity154 lauded the process			0
" this process is a means of ending the era of impunity for the terrible and tragic violence that has touched all of @entity4 's communities , " the department said in a statement			2
@entity0 's @entity166 contributed to this report .			0
