-- a @entity2 court has reopened an investigation into an allegation that one of the world 's richest men , @entity8 prince @entity5 , raped a young woman on a yacht on the island of @entity12 in 2008			1
but the prince says that not only is he innocent , but that he has n't even been in @entity12 in more than a decade -- and that others have tried to impersonate him			2
the woman filed her complaint in @entity12 in august 2008 , but a local judge shelved it last year , citing a lack of evidence that a crime had been committed , according to court documents			1
the woman appealed to the next highest court , the @entity23 , which ruled that the lower court in @entity12 should reopen the investigation			1
according to court documents obtained by @entity0 , the victim argued in her appeal that the real reason the lower court tossed out the case was that the alleged perpetrator was a powerful member of the @entity8 royal family			1
a second document shows that the lower court has complied with the latest ruling , labeling @entity5 as a person an " imputado , " or someone " under official investigation , " and is seeking a statement from him			1
being named an imputado is a step short of an indictment			0
the @entity8 prince , a billionaire and the biggest foreign investor in companies such a @entity47 , said in a statement that it was not until this week that he learned of the accusation			1
" these allegations are completely and utterly false , " said a statement from his investment firm , @entity55 " the alleged encounter simply never happened			0
" according to the statement , the prince does n't even vacation in @entity2 waters			0
travel records show that he was elsewhere on the night of the alleged rape and in the company of others , the statement says			2
but @entity65 , one of the lawyers for the alleged victim , says there is evidence that they want to the court to examine further			1
according to the court documents , the woman believed that her drink had been drugged			2
she sent a text message to a friend stating as much			0
she awoke on a yacht to find she was being sexually assaulted by a man she identified as @entity5 , according to court documents			1
@entity65 told @entity0 that " there were remains of semen " that should be examined against the prince 's dna , as well as " remains of a tranquilizer that produced the symptoms she had			0
" the evidence came from tests carried out 30 hours after the alleged rape , the attorney said , so the alcohol was gone from her body , but not the drug or the dna			2
@entity65 said the alleged victim 's mother could answer questions from @entity0 , but only through e-mail			1
he provided responses to @entity0 's questions that he said were from the mother			0
@entity0 can not independently confirm that the message was from the victim 's mother			0
" she wanted to reopen the case due to the huge injustice and a feeling of a helplessness ; powerful people should not take undue advantage of it and have others subjected to them , " the message said			2
the message described the " man or men " who allegedly abused the young woman as powerful individuals who threatened her on board the yacht			0
asked if her daughter was afraid to appeal the case , the mother said , " part of the fear has a lot of dignity and that ca n't be bought nor scared off with threats			0
" the young woman , a dual @entity2 and @entity134 citizen , is now 23 years old , the e-mail said			0
asked for additional comment on thursday , prince @entity5 's representatives did not immediately respond to @entity0 .			1
