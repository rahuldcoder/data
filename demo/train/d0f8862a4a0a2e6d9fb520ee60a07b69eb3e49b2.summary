-- as the crisis in @entity2 intensifies and @entity4 's hold on power starts to unravel , concerns are mounting over what may come next for the beleaguered nation			1
some foresee bloody sectarian strife or a descent into militia rule , while others fear what might become of its chemical weapons stockpile			1
not all observers agree it 's the beginning of the endgame for @entity4 , but all are sure there 's no clear road map for what lies ahead			1
the prospects for @entity4 are " very grim , " said @entity25 , an associate fellow at the @entity27 - based @entity26 think tank and a doctoral student at @entity30			2
@entity2 's chemical weapons threat demands a response " there 's no going back , " he said			1
" he 's not far from collapse , because what 's occurred through defection or assassination is that the political part of his regime has been hollowed out			0
" by contrast dr. @entity41 , director of the @entity42 at the @entity43 in @entity44 , considers it too soon to write @entity4 out of the picture			2
but in a scenario where he is pushed out -- bringing to an end four decades of rule by him and his father before him -- the @entity2 military will likely play a major role in what happens next , @entity41 said			1
recent defections of high - level officers -- notably regime insider @entity57			0
gen. @entity58 -- on top of the desertion of many rank and file personnel , signal an erosion of the army 's coherence in the face of the rebellion			0
many of those at the top are determined to fight on to the end because they fear the personal consequences for them if they lose , analysts say			2
in what some saw as a turning point after more than 16 months of violence , @entity4 lost four top aides following an explosion in @entity79 last week , as rebel forces attacked the capital and @entity2 's commercial hub , @entity83			1
reinforcements head to @entity83 so far , @entity4 has shown no signs of quitting			2
but what 's not yet clear is how much stomach he has for a continued bloody conflict , and whether he might be more inclined to negotiate a transition than some of his immediate entourage , @entity41 said			0
if @entity4 's ouster were the result of a " palace coup , " involving negotiation between some insiders and the insurgency , slightly more continuity would ensue , said @entity25			1
however , such a transition is likely to be unstable because many rebels would refuse to accept it and would fight on			0
he believes it more likely that the regime collapses entirely and the @entity106 -- an opposition coalition whose leadership resides outside of @entity2 -- stakes a claim to lead the transition as part of a coalition also involving opposition figures within @entity2 and @entity114 and liberal representatives			2
however , unlike @entity118 , where the @entity119 presented a fairly unified voice as @entity122 's regime crumbled , the opposition in @entity2 remains more fragmented and no credible transitional leader has yet come to the fore , @entity25 said			1
@entity41 agrees that while the @entity106 " aspires to be the linchpin in the transition , " questions remain over how effective it could be and what support it commands among rebels on the ground			0
@entity133 , who advised a previous president of the @entity106 , told @entity0 in march that his group has a plan for a @entity138 era , including the formation of a transitional unity government and a body to draw up a new constitution and election laws , leading eventually to parliamentary and presidential elections			0
at the time , observers responded with skepticism			0
" there 's a lack of coordination amongst the insiders , and they represent the outsiders , not the insiders , " said former @entity149 ambassador to @entity2 @entity150			1
" it 's not a coherent opposition leadership			0
" what we need to know about @entity2 another scenario sees @entity2 descend into a chaotic and bloody sectarian conflict , pitting @entity2 's majority @entity163 against the ruling @entity166 sect , an offshoot of @entity168 , and embroiling its @entity169 , @entity170 and other minority groups too			1
such a conflict risks destabilizing the wider region			2
the recent defection of two key @entity163 figures , @entity58 and @entity2 's ambassador to @entity177 , @entity176 , means all @entity4 has left is a narrow @entity166 bloc with shrinking public support , @entity25 said			1
if the regime collapses , the @entity166 could retreat to strongholds in the northwest of the country around @entity184 and attempt to reconstitute a state there , he said			0
@entity2 's @entity114 could also seek greater autonomy , a move which would worry @entity188 , which has a troubled relationship with its own @entity114 population			1
however , @entity191 , an associate fellow at the @entity192 think tank , argues against making too much of @entity2 's sectarian tensions			1
the regime " has been using the sectarian line , but the opposition and the rebels have increasingly repeated that they do not view it in those terms , " she said			0
" so it 's not the @entity166 who are crumbling , it 's a regime			0
... it means many people within that regime , whatever religious denomination they are , they do n't necessarily agree with the way things are happening			0
" sectarianism aside , the large number of militia groups that have taken up arms across @entity2 will present a " significant challenge " to the country 's future stability whoever ends up in power , @entity25 said			1
they range from the pro-government @entity219 militia groups , blamed by opposition activists for many of the more brutal attacks on civilians , to rebel hardline @entity225 groups and local networks that have formed to protect their villages			0
at the same time , the rebel @entity230 , largely composed of soldiers who defected from the @entity4 regime , is more a loose organization of armed groups than a coherent military body , said @entity25			1
faces of the @entity230 he predicts that whatever @entity2 government results from the conflict will not be in charge of its whole territory , a problem made worse by the porous nature of the country 's borders			2
if the @entity106 ultimately does take charge , it may struggle to contain the worst excesses of the militia groups , he said			0
the @entity249 said this month that it considers the conflict a " non-international armed conflict " -- or a civil war -- but some analysts say international forces are in fact involved			0
opposition forces are being " quite well - armed and probably trained by external clandestine forces from the @entity258 and probably from @entity188 , " @entity41 said			0
questions should also be asked about some @entity261 and @entity262 involvement , he added			0
at the same time , @entity2 's neighbors , which include @entity188 , @entity177 and @entity264 , all have a stake in how the conflict plays out and exert varying degrees of influence within @entity2			1
part of the international community 's unease stems from @entity2 's position as a regional powerhouse			1
" @entity2 really is the epicenter of the @entity278 - @entity277 conflict , and the international community 's confrontation with @entity281 , " said @entity41			2
another concern to those watching from the wings is @entity2 's stockpile of chemical weapons			1
@entity2 's foreign ministry said monday that the country has chemical weapons that it would be willing to use against foreign attackers , although it sought to roll back the message tuesday			1
its remarks led to strong warnings from @entity149 officials , including president @entity295 , who said such a move would be a " tragic mistake			0
" @entity295 administration officials are now holding regular high - level meetings to discuss the ongoing situation in @entity2 and begin thinking about @entity149 priorities in a @entity304 era , a senior @entity149 official told @entity0 monday			2
the @entity295 administration has also stepped up its discussions with @entity277 , @entity307 and @entity188 about @entity2 's chemical weapons arsenal the @entity4 regime " probably has the largest and most advanced chemical warfare program in the @entity278 world , " according to @entity312 , senior fellow and director of the military and security studies program at the @entity316			1
a @entity2 town 's ' street of death ' but there is good reason to be skeptical that this arsenal would ever be used , @entity25 said			2
@entity2 commanders would not want to be held individually responsible with no regime to protect them , he said			0
commanders are also well aware that the risk of such weapons getting into the hands of allies such as @entity329 would likely induce external intervention , particularly from @entity277			0
for some observers , the international community 's increasing focus on @entity2 's weapons stockpile also conjures unwelcome echoes of the run - up to the @entity177 war			1
@entity2 allies @entity338 and @entity340 , who last week blocked another @entity343 resolution for new sanctions if @entity2 government forces do n't stop attacks against civilians , are opposed to the kind of foreign intervention seen in @entity177 as well as in @entity118 last year			2
@entity350 indicated tuesday that @entity79 should refrain from making use of chemical weapons in line with its ratification of @entity356 protocols			1
" @entity340 's policy is based on the understanding that @entity2 authorities will continue to strictly follow their international obligations , " the foreign ministry said			1
as for @entity4 , if he is forced from power , his personal fate will likely depend on whether he remains in @entity2 , and in whose hands			1
a new regime might want to prosecute him for alleged war crimes or it might decide it would be more advantageous to allow him to go into exile , said @entity41			0
@entity370 's options for exile appear limited , with much of the world outraged by the thousands of civilian deaths resulting from his regime 's crackdown on what it calls " armed terrorists			0
" @entity41 speculates that a country that is " not quite @entity340 , " such as @entity380 or @entity381 , could offer a haven			0
alternatively , @entity4 could hang on to power for months yet , if regime forces and the @entity230 continue to battle without a decisive victory on either side and the international community declines to step in			0
so long as @entity340 and @entity338 continue to block tougher @entity343 action on @entity2 , foreign intervention seems unlikely			2
and although @entity149 officicals have led calls for an end to the conflict , @entity41 suggests that a prolonged conflict in @entity2 might not be the " worst option " from an @entity277 or @entity262 militarist point of view , because neutralizing @entity2 would have the effect of isolating @entity329 , and to a degree @entity397 , from @entity281 , an ally of @entity79			0
" if you are a @entity402 security planner who thinks it 's highly likely that there has to be a military confrontation with @entity281 sooner or later , then keeping @entity2 off the board is probably one of the things that 's quite desirable to do , " he said			1
why @entity2 could get even uglier @entity0 's @entity409 , @entity410 and @entity411 contributed to this report .			2

it is hard to predict what might follow the ouster of @entity4 , analysts say
@entity2 's warning it could use chemical weapons against foreign attackers prompts alarm
some fear @entity2 may descend into sectarian violence , destabilizing the region
@entity2 's military is likely to play a key role in how events *pan* out
