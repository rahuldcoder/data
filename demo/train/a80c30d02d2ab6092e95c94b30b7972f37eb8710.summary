-- friday 's weak jobs report is more than a disappointing blip			1
it is a glimpse ahead of our disappointing future			1
nearly three years from the beginning of the economic recovery in the summer of 2009 , the @entity7 economy has replaced not even half the jobs lost in the slump of 2007 - 2009			1
at the current pace of job creation , it will take until 2017 to replace all the jobs lost			1
but of course the population has grown since 2007 , so " replacement " is not good enough			0
we are even further away from equaling the employment rate of 2007 -- the proportion of the working - age population at work			0
even when ( or if ) full job recovery does come , it will not restore the economy of 2007 just as it was			2
the best book written about the social effects of the @entity31 is @entity32 's " pinched			2
" @entity32 shows us a new world emerging from the catastrophe of 2008 , a new world that most @entity7 will find harsher than the old			1
for example : despite the long , slow relative decline of manufacturing as a source of @entity7 jobs , the total number of manufacturing jobs in the @entity7 had remained constant at about 18 million for decades			1
between 2007 and 2009 , the number of manufacturing jobs dropped by 6 million			2
while manufacturing is beginning a recovery now , it seems impossible that the sector will regenerate to anything like its former extent			0
the new jobs being added to the @entity7 economy pay less , on average , than the jobs lost -- which is why the average rate of pay in the @entity7 remains stagnant or even drops as the number of jobs slowly grows			1
at the top of the economic heap , recovery has been more complete			2
the richest @entity7 suffered sharp shocks to their wealth when markets collapsed in 2008 - 2009			1
as financial markets have revived , so has the wealth of the top 1 % ( households earning more than $ 380,000 per year			0
) the top 5 % have done ok , too			0
( the top 5 % begins a little south of $ 200,000 in household income			0
) for most of the country , however , the outlook is -- to borrow @entity32 's title -- " pinched			2
" young people who come of age in the crisis will earn less through their lives than those who came of age during happier times			0
a sense of unfairness spreads through the society			0
politics becomes angrier and more paranoid -- for those who take part -- while many others drop out of public life entirely , disregarded and alienated			0
the country 's political class tends to discuss these hard economic and cultural facts as if they were interesting only in relation to the presidential race , as if the only questions that mattered about economics were : " good for @entity94 ? " " bad for @entity94 ? " for most of the country , however , @entity94 is a flickering electronic image , an only intermittently interesting distraction from the realities of life : stagnant pay , unattractive job options , darkening retirement prospects for the middle - aged and narrowing opportunities for the young			1
what would it take to do better ? the answer , ironically , will be nearly equally difficult ( but in very different ways ) for politicians of either party			2
to do better , we 'll need a program to stimulate employment for the long - term unemployed -- including potentially a @entity115 - style requirement that nobody receive benefits without working			0
it 's no good to anybody -- the unemployed least of all -- to allow the unemployed to collect two years ' worth of benefits while waiting at home , their skills atrophying , their resumes going stale			1
to do better , we may need to induce employers to create jobs , not only through tax cuts but through direct subsidies , including subsidies of the cost of health coverage			2
( especially for older workers , health costs can be more of a deterrent to hiring even than the cost of wages			0
) we will need to curtail the generosity of @entity139 to open fiscal room for government programs to support opportunities for the young			0
we will need a permissive monetary policy that accepts moderate inflation to reduce the burden of mortgages and other debts -- even if it bites a little into savings and fixed incomes			0
we 'll need above all to recognize the magnitude of the social distress we still face , even as the economic statistics tell us of a recovery that moves financial markets and presidential polls -- but that threatens to bypass tens of millions of @entity7 for months and years			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159			1

@entity159 : friday 's weak jobs report is a sign of @entity7 's economic future
@entity159 says we are many years away from regaining all jobs lost in the recession
most @entity7 are seeing their economic future *changed* for the worse , he says
