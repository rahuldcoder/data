-- @entity2 's title celebrations have been put on hold for another week after the champions - elect suffered a shock defeat on saturday and closest rivals @entity6 won			1
@entity2 would have clinched a first @entity8 crown since 2002 with victory against the @entity11 's bottom team if @entity6 had drawn or lost			1
but the second - placed club kept the title race going into the final three games of the season with a 2 - 1 victory over @entity18 , then @entity12 kept alive the club 's slim survival hopes with a 1 - 0 victory in the late match			1
defending champions @entity23 could not return to third place , being held at @entity25 , and face a battle for the final @entity28 spot with @entity29 -- who beat @entity31 3 - 1 on thursday			1
the title race continues next weekend in a similar scenario as @entity2 host @entity33 on saturday and @entity6 travel to @entity36 on sunday			1
@entity29 win puts pressure on @entity23 @entity2 's lead was trimmed to five points after @entity42 's winner 10 minutes before halftime , which moved @entity12 off the bottom on goal difference above @entity46 and left three clubs on 29 points			1
@entity49 can climb out of that triumvirate at home to 14th - placed @entity36 on sunday , but even victory will still leave the 2008 - 09 champions in the relegation playoff place			0
@entity55 striker @entity42 held off @entity56 , cut in from the left and beat @entity2 keeper @entity58 to give the home team a shock lead			1
@entity2 coach @entity61 brought on @entity62 and top @entity63 , but the closest the visitors came to scoring was when teenager @entity65 hit the crossbar			0
@entity6 came from behind to beat mid-table @entity18 , who led in the 28th minute when @entity69 midfielder @entity68 went past three men before before beating goalkeeer @entity71			2
@entity68 also hit the post before the home team equalized five minutes from halftime , when @entity75 headed in @entity77 's corner			0
@entity79 ' side then went ahead six minutes after the break as @entity77 slammed home the winner when @entity18 's defense could not clear the ball from their own box			2
@entity23 needed a controversial late penalty to salvage a point at struggling @entity25 , who took the lead nine minutes after halftime			1
the home side , hovering uncomfortably above the relegation playoff place , cheered the sellout crowd when @entity93 drove in a 54th - minute shot after @entity23 midfielder @entity95 deflected @entity97 's free - kick into his path			2
@entity99 should have doubled the lead but squandered two chances before @entity23 received a lifeline with two minutes left when @entity103 was ruled to have fouled @entity104			2
@entity105 netted the resulting penalty for his 23rd league goal this season , while angry home coach @entity109 was sent to the stands for arguing			0
@entity112 's erratic season continued as the @entity28 semifinalists lost 1 - 0 at home to @entity115 ahead of tuesday 's visit by @entity118 leaders @entity119			1
the winner came four minutes before halftime as @entity122 played in @entity123 and the @entity125 striker beat goalkeeper @entity126 , who announced this week that he is poised to leave @entity112 after deciding not to extend his contract			0
@entity115 's first win at @entity112 in more than a decade lifted the promoted club to eight points above third - bottom @entity49			2
@entity46 , however , look set for an immediate return to the second division after the 3 - 1 home defeat by @entity134 left the club bottom			1
@entity136 put @entity46 ahead in the first half , but @entity138 put through his own net five minutes after the break			0
then @entity141 striker @entity140 scored twice in 60 seconds with less than 20 minutes to play to lift @entity134 up to 10th , a point above @entity115			0
@entity143 also eased any relegation fears with a 3 - 0 win at home to seventh - placed @entity147 , moving seven points clear of @entity49			0
@entity150 striker @entity149 opened the scoring in the sixth minute and rounded off the day after substitute @entity152 doubled the lead with 12 to play			0
in sunday 's other game , fifth - placed @entity155 travel to fellow @entity156 hopefuls @entity33 .			0

long - time leaders @entity2 must wait another week to clinch seventh title
second - placed @entity6 keep race alive with victory over @entity18
@entity2 's lead cut to five points with three games left after @entity12 defeat
@entity23 's @entity28 hopes *dented* by 1 - 1 draw at @entity25
