-- in @entity3 , 33 - year - old @entity2 's body is being maintained with technology after being reportedly declared dead based on neurologic criteria , meaning her brain can no longer keep her body alive and functioning			1
her husband said she would n't want to be kept alive by medical technology			1
but state law requires that her body be sustained because she is 19 weeks pregnant			1
the issues surrounding @entity2 's case are not isolated			0
in @entity16 , 13 - year - old @entity15 's body is also being maintained with technology			1
her family wants to continue keeping her alive even though her doctors consider her legally dead			1
there are families all over the world who have faced similar wrenching decisions			0
for the medical community and families affected in these cases , thorny ethical issues remain unanswered			1
conventional wisdom says that the patient has the right to make a decision , but when he or she is unable to , the legal surrogate decides			0
with @entity2 , there are two lives at stake : hers and that of her unborn child			2
some believe that the life of the mother is directly linked to the life of the infant			2
they are viewed as an inextricable unit ; they live and die together			0
for others , the mother and fetus are viewed as separate beings with independent interests			2
as a nurse and clinical ethicist , i have witnessed firsthand the anguish of family members who must make a choice about continuing pregnancies under such uncertain circumstances , or the aggressiveness of treatment for their extremely premature infants			2
generally , under conditions where there is great uncertainty about outcome for either the mother or the infant , we defer to the family to make an informed decision			2
do @entity74 's preferences become nullified because she is pregnant ? should mr. @entity79 's request that his wife be allowed to die in a way that is consistent with her wishes be disregarded ? what is the ethical justification of mandating continued treatment that is contrary to the patient 's and surrogate 's wishes ? does the fetus become a ward of the state and the woman 's body merely a biologic incubator for the fetus ? who then is responsible for the ongoing costs and care of the woman 's body and the fetus should it be sustained to the point of viability ( 24 weeks ) ? keep in mind that there are significant unknowns			1
how would the lack of oxygen or other treatments impact the developing fetus ? even if the fetus could be sustained to the point of viability , complications resulting from dependence on technology , severe disabilities or premature death are quite possible			1
another ethical aspect of this tragic case is the impact on @entity2 's medical personnel , who are providing treatments that are not desired by the patient or her surrogate , and who are perceived to sustain death rather than life			1
clearly , the first priority of doctors , nurses and other clinicians is the well - being of their patients			2
their mandate is : first , do no harm			0
they want to help patients and avoid or remove their suffering			2
whose interests are they obliged to promote when they have a patient like @entity2 ? but medical personnel are not merely mindless robots who implement the decisions of others			0
they , too , have moral stakes in the process and outcomes of their care			0
in order for them to do their work with competence , respect and compassion , they must preserve their own sense of integrity			0
when doctors and nurses begin to view their actions as causing physical , emotional or spiritual harms to their patients , it causes them moral distress			0
they begin to wonder : how can i see myself as a good doctor or nurse when i am participating in actions that i perceive as wrong or ethically unjustified ? the result is that clinicians can burn out			0
they become cynical , detached or numb			0
there are no easy answers			0
cases like @entity2 are always heartbreaking			0
there are many things that technology in medicine can not cure or repair			2
we can not know whether attempting to sustain her biologic function to support her pregnancy will yield a healthy infant			2
using technology is always a double - edged sword ; the very technology that creates hope can also create suffering			1
it is time to pause to examine again our " technology default			0
" we must engage with our communities about the boundaries of using technology , and what the appropriate interventions are when a person 's life is sustained with technology			1
some would argue that the @entity3 law rightly protects the interests of the developing fetus and restricts the family 's choices			1
is the state a better guardian for the fetus than his or her biological parents ? we should always have a reverence for life and the ending of life			1
if there is uncertainty about the degree of brain damage a person has suffered , then it is ethical to use medical technology to keep him or her alive until a better determination can been made			1
however , as in the case of @entity2 , we must consider whether keeping her alive by invoking a state law honors her and her memory			1
we need to find ways to make decisions that are respectful , fair and promote integrity			0
we also need to accept the limits of what medicine can and can not do			0
the time has come for a new paradigm for ethical practice in health care			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			1

the husband of a pregnant brain dead woman asks she be taken off of life support
@entity240 : but @entity3 law says she must be kept alive because of her unborn fetus
she asks : is it ethical to keep her body alive against the wishes of her family ?
@entity240 : technology can be a double - edged sword , it can create hope or suffering
