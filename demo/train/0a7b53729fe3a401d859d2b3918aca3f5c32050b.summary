-- its shape and feature set will be familiar to anyone who 's seen other pavilion dv6000 series laptops , but the special edition @entity6 dv6985se stands out for two reasons			1
first , its upscale design includes an eye - catching , copper - colored lid and silver interior , both bearing a faint imprint that looks like etching			0
the other special feature : a 12 - cell battery that provided one of the longest battery lives we 've seen in @entity21			1
otherwise , the @entity6 dv6985se is a fairly typical mainstream laptop , with a decent feature set and strong performance			1
of course , the features that make the pavilion dv6985se special are also its downside			2
that extra battery does add weight , and the flashy design certainly is n't for everyone ( though we happen to love it )			2
users who want something more portable or more subdued should look to the @entity38 , which offers similar performance and features ( but lacks multimedia controls ) for a slightly lower price			2
or you could scrap the 15 - inch size entirely and go for a 14 - inch model like the @entity46 or the @entity47			2
the @entity49 's shape is essentially the same as the @entity51 we reviewed earlier this summer			0
the " special edition " designation , however , warrants a spiffy new color scheme ; in the case of the @entity57 , that means a shiny copper - colored lid and display bezel with a silver keyboard deck and keys			0
both the lid and wrist - rest incorporate a subtle imprint design of narrow stripes that morph into organic shapes reminiscent of @entity67 ; the pattern even extends across the touch pad			0
the overall effect is very appealing -- certainly more expensive - looking than its actual price ( more so when you factor in @entity73 currently offers it with a $ 100 discount ) -- but also seems destined to look slightly dated by the time you graduate			2
the @entity6 dv6985se we reviewed differs from its siblings in one other significant way : the laptop includes a bulky 12 - cell battery that raises the back of the system an inch and contributes to its hefty 6.6 - pound weight			1
( with @entity6 's standard pavilion battery , the system would weigh closer to 6 pounds -- but a smaller battery is n't an option on this fixed configuration			1
) the extra juice will come in handy when cranking out term papers , but you probably wo n't enjoy carrying the laptop to the library			0
the 15.4 - inch wide - screen display on the @entity6 dv6985se has a typical 1,280x800 native resolution , which is standard for a screen this size			1
the screen 's glossy finish produces rich colors and contrast ; we found it minimally distracting while surfing the @entity106 and typing e-mail but quite enjoyable for watching movies			0
a 1.3 - megapixel @entity109 above the display lets users conduct video chats			0
typing was comfortable on the @entity97 's nearly full - size keyboard			1
the wide touch pad includes a scroll zone , and we love the on / off button above the pad , which is handy when you want to use an external mouse or just type without worrying about misplacing the cursor			0
above the keyboard sits a row of light - touch controls to launch @entity6 's @entity126 media player , control disc playback , and adjust volume			1
perhaps to maintain the laptop 's polished aesthetic , @entity6 left off the handy port labels found on the keyboard deck of nearly every other @entity6 laptop			1
the @entity6 dv6985se includes most of the ports and connections we 'd expect to see on a laptop of its size , though the @entity38 does manage to squeeze one more usb port into its similar footprint			1
( we have a feeling a usb port was jettisoned to make room for the @entity146 , which lets you connect to an @entity6 docking station			2
) the @entity6 also lacks @entity149 , which is surprising given its otherwise upscale bent			0
we do like the @entity6 's dual headphone jacks , which make it easy to share movies and music with friends			2
we 're less impressed with the @entity157 stereo speakers , which are loud and clear but produce too - treble sound			0
the retail - only @entity97 comes in a single fixed configuration that includes a @entity162 processor -- part of @entity166 's previous - generation @entity165 platform and the standard for mainstream systems -- plus a generous @entity169 of @entity170			1
paired with 64 - bit @entity171 , that @entity172 of @entity170 gave the @entity6 dv6985se a notable boost on our @entity175 benchmark , where the first three spots among back - to - school systems went to 64 - bit - equipped laptops			1
otherwise , the @entity97 performed admirably on @entity21 ' benchmarks , showing enough multitasking and processing oomph for all your scholarly pursuits ( and diversions )			0
as mentioned above , the @entity6 dv6985se includes a massive 12 - cell battery that adds significant weight to the system			1
but it just might be worth schlepping around : it ran for 5 hours and 17 minutes on @entity21 ' video playback drain test			0
that 's one of the lengthiest battery scores we 've seen , and bests all our other mainstream back - to - school systems , which featured six - cell batteries , by nearly 2 hours			1
our video playback battery drain test is especially grueling , so you can expect even longer life from casual web surfing and office use			0
@entity6 backs the @entity97 with an industry - standard one - year warranty			1
toll - free telephone support is available 24 - 7 during your warranty period , and the @entity6 support web site includes real - time chat with a tech representative			2
if you want to troubleshoot problems yourself , you can search through the site 's thorough faq database			0
