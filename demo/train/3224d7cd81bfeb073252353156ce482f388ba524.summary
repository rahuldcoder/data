@entity0 -- when @entity4 died unexpectedly two years ago , his fans worldwide erupted in a torrent of grief , anguish and -- in tribute to the pop icon -- song and dance			2
on monday , there were hugs , tears and shrieks of joy among his fans packed outside a @entity19 courtroom after a jury found @entity4 's physician , @entity21 , guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the singer 's death			1
jury finds @entity21 guilty " @entity29 , guilty ! " one woman yelled out , seconds after the verdict was announced			1
others appeared to almost break out in song ; some seemed to start dancing ; and a chant soon rose up of " justice , justice , justice			0
" the honking horns and revelry were in contrast to the quiet scene inside @entity41 , where judge @entity42 had earlier urged people to constrain their emotions			2
but there were no such restrictions outside			0
hundreds had packed the streets and sidewalks earlier in the day anticipating a verdict			0
many held signs calling for @entity21 's conviction , like one saying , " @entity21 , burn in hell			2
" a long banner held out by several people had a simpler , more sentimental message : " we miss @entity4			2
" they were joined by throngs of photographers and videographers			0
many flanked a walkway to the courtroom , their flashbulbs popping as @entity4 family members , lawyers and others hurriedly walked into the courthouse to learn @entity21 's fate			1
the @entity74 's office reported in june 2009 that the entertainer had died after suffering cardiac arrest			2
@entity4 's death on june 25 , 2009 , was caused by " acute propofol intoxication " in combination with two sedatives , the coroner ruled			1
but @entity21 was eventually indicted , as prosecutors claimed he was criminally negligent in giving @entity4 excess amounts of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat the singer 's insomnia			1
when the jury decided in the prosecution 's favor , the emotions spilled over on the streets as people yelled out , burst into tears and smiled			1
" i 'm so happy , " one woman , who had traveled to @entity19 from @entity95 , @entity96 , told @entity98 's @entity97 outside the courthouse			0
" one of the late singer 's sisters , @entity103 , thanked all those involved in @entity21 's conviction , which she called a " victory			1
" " everybody was wonderful , " she said as she left the courthouse			0
her brother @entity109 said " justice was served , " while opining that @entity21 should have to serve more than even the four - year maximum that he could get			1
" @entity4 is with us , " @entity109 said			1
and @entity113 , a friend of the @entity114 and mother of @entity116 , said while leaving the courthouse that the verdict was bittersweet , though still satisfying			0
" at least they 'll feel some kind of relief , some kind of closure , " she told @entity98 , referring to @entity4 's parents , @entity120 and @entity121			1
the reaction was equally swift and emotional online and outside @entity0			0
@entity127 , a @entity1 ireporter and student at @entity130 , @entity131 , said she broke into tears on hearing the news			0
" it 's really sad to know that @entity21 , because of his negligence , took @entity4 away , " @entity134 said , expressing hope that it might dissuade " doctor - shopping " that might lead people to get more drugs than they can safely have			1
" that 's why i cried			0
" on social networking sites like @entity145 , the reaction was likewise fast , furious and emotional			0
" next time do n't be so greedy @entity21 ! guilty ! " wrote one such commenter on @entity145 , former @entity148 and hip - hop personality @entity149			2
hip - hop artist @entity150 offered a restrained reaction on her @entity145 feed , saying , " people are cheering , but there really are no winners here			1
this has been an utter tragedy from beginning to end			0
" @entity159 and @entity160 , the co-executors of @entity4 's estate , released a statement on @entity164 in which they lauded the verdict and remembered the singer as " the greatest entertainer that has ever lived			1
" " the estate of @entity4 and @entity171 himself has always believed the jury system works and despite the tragedy that brought about this trial we are in agreement with the jury 's verdict , " they wrote			2
" in this case , justice has been served			0
" @entity1 's @entity181 contributed to this report .			0
