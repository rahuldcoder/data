-- as a hobby , @entity1 , a teacher and mother of two , spends many of her nights searching for endangered toads on the country roads near her home outside @entity8 , @entity9			1
volunteers in @entity9 are collecting data on the @entity12 , which is endangered			1
she often finds them flattened on the street			0
" they 're so beautiful and it 's just really hard to live with , especially when you 're living on the road right here , " the 33 - year - old said of the toad deaths			2
" so we started doing something about it			2
we started saving them off the road in the middle of the rain			2
" when a scientist caught onto her efforts , @entity1 and a friend assembled about 20 volunteers -- a group she calls the " @entity33 " -- to collect data on the endangered @entity12			1
the information they collect is being used in scientific research			1
each time @entity1 comes upon one of the spotted , faintly iridescent creatures , she springs into action			0
she marks down gps coordinates , measures the toad , makes notes on its behavior ( is a mate stuck to its back ? is it headed toward a pond ? ) and uploads the information so scientists can use it			2
oh , and she moves the toad out of traffic 's way , too			0
while her nighttime hobby may sound a bit strange , @entity1 is far from alone in her efforts to collect amateur scientific data			1
at a time when climate change and urbanization are poised to set off a new wave of extinction , some members of the scientific community are turning toward backyard biologists for the data they need to monitor ecosystems and protect struggling species			1
this " citizen science " movement is not exactly new , but it has grown fresh legs as the @entity72 and social - networking sites help people with uber - specified and often bizarre interests gang up for a cause			1
amateur - produced web sites now serve as data hubs for squirrel sightings , bird photos , ant anthologies , snapshots of leaves , flowers and trees , water quality info , beetle hunts and firefly tracking , among others			1
find links at @entity0 's @entity92 blog " it 's pretty random , " said @entity93 of the @entity94			0
" there 's a lot of charismatic things that wo n't surprise you -- backyard birds , that sort of thing			0
but there are also thriving communities of people who like to take pictures of butterflies , centipedes , wildflowers , plants			1
" some of the sites have sweeping goals			2
the @entity94 , which seeks to gather online information on all known species , has started taking public submissions through a public @entity118 group			2
some individual users have uploaded more than 2,000 photos			0
@entity121 , out of @entity122 , @entity123 , aims to collect so much amateur data about plant species that scientists will be able to tell how climate change is altering the seasons in @entity129			1
the venture , managed by the @entity131 , gathers " data that would not otherwise be collected , " said @entity133 , the project 's director			1
" we have these additional sentinel eyes on the landscape , if you will			0
there are n't enough ecologists to be making all of these different plant observations			0
" @entity143 funding for citizen science dropped off significantly in 2002 but generally has been on the rise since , according to budget numbers compiled for @entity0			2
since that year , funding in the @entity148 has increased more than 240 percent , to more than $ 3 million for 2008			0
several of the web projects receive government funding , but others survive on their own merits			0
in @entity154 , @entity153 founded the @entity155 , an international compilation of bird videos , sounds and photos that 's funded solely by his company			0
he said the intense passion of birders around the world , plus some money from his publishing company , keep the site running			0
amateurs have posted video of never - before - seen birds on the site , he said , and some of the work has been the foundation for scientific articles			0
technology is amplifying this passion for citizen science , which has been around since scientists started cataloging species			1
researchers at several universities are working on @entity182 applications and computer programs that could analyze digital photos of plant leaves and automatically identify the plant 's species			1
when those photos -- from ordinary people all over the world -- are paired with the photographer 's location and uploaded to a database , the information would be more valuable than anything scientists could come up with on their own , said @entity197 , a botanist and research scientist at the @entity200 's @entity199			1
the information could help scientists know if a species is going extinct or dying off in certain regions as the climate warms			1
identifying a plant species can be tricky , @entity197 said , so these technologies also would ensure that nonprofessional data is good enough to use for scientific research			1
" when people do these things as citizen scientists you 're always a little suspect as to , ' are you getting it right ? ' " he said			1
" there 's some plants out there that are maples and look like oaks -- and only i would know they 're really maples			0
but with this system we would have a standard way of identifying the accuracy of this information			0
" some scientists said they 're excited about the trend toward citizen - submitted data because it is impossible for scientists to document all of the changes going on around the world			1
" at some point it will really lead to almost a democratization of science , where the amateurs and the volunteers are having just as much of an impact on science as the professionals are , " said @entity233 , who started a citizen science project with the @entity235 in 1987			1
" it 's just going so fast i ca n't keep up with it anymore			0
" others find the movement limited or controversial			0
the relationship between formal science and citizen science is similar to that between professional news reporters and bloggers ; some scientists worry that the information coming in from nonprofessionals will be inaccurate , said @entity258 , a senior director at @entity259			1
the citizen efforts are also limited in the sense that , at least for now , they 're largely concentrated in @entity129 and @entity263 , where there are n't nearly as many plant and animal species as in @entity267 and @entity9			1
that 's beginning to change , though , said @entity269 , a conservation science adviser at @entity259			0
" it 's gaining steam , " he said of the global citizen - science movement			1
" it 's working very well and it 's a great way also to engage the community in conservation issues			0
" as photo - taking cell phones become more popular in developing countries , a more diverse group will join the efforts , said @entity197 , the @entity200 botanist			2
@entity1 's group devoted to the @entity12 now works with the @entity281 to promote understanding of the endangered species			0
dr. @entity284 , a researcher with the institute , said by e-mail that some research on the toad would be possible without the volunteer efforts			0
but the " @entity33 " raise awareness and help scientists " obtain usable accurate data from a much wider area than we could possibly manage or fund , " he wrote			2
when @entity1 started the project , she did n't know much about the toads -- they were just a creature she found squashed in front of her house			2
now she has a personal connection to them			0
she said citizen science is a way for people to connect with their local environment -- and to make a difference			2
" there are so many problems in the world , but i think the main problem is that everybody is worried about everybody else 's problems that they do n't focus in on their little areas , " she said .			0

average people help scientists collect valuable data in era of climate change
many web sites are hubs for citizen - collected info used in research
researchers developing @entity182 app to automatically identify plants , upload data
in @entity9 , a teacher has started a network of people collecting info on toads
