-- @entity2 coach @entity1 is spoilt for striking choice as his side attempt to overcome a two - goal @entity6 semifinal deficit against @entity8 , but faces a defensive poser with captain @entity10 suspended			1
@entity10 picked up a yellow card in the 3 - 1 defeat to @entity8 in the @entity13 last weekend , ruling him out of the second leg , and he will be sorely missed at center back			1
@entity2 know that the concession of an early away goal would leave them facing an uphill task against @entity21 's @entity20 champions and @entity1 must chose between @entity22 and @entity23 to partner @entity24 in the center of their defense			1
he also is waiting on the fitness of full - back @entity29 , with @entity31 set to continue in his place			2
@entity24 and @entity23 played together at @entity33 and were outstanding in the recent ' @entity35 ' win over @entity36 so may well get the nod from @entity1			2
@entity24 is hoping the atmosphere in a capacity @entity40 will make it an uncomfortable night for their opponents			0
" i hope the atmosphere makes the @entity8 players hate their profession for 90 minutes , " he told the official @entity2 club web site			1
" it all helps a great deal			0
i do n't remember an atmosphere like this			0
people are so engaged , excited and confident			0
up front , @entity1 has no less than six in - form attacking options , with @entity56 and @entity57 forming a lethal combination in recent matches while @entity61 star @entity60 is returning to full fitness and scored in the weekend league win over @entity64			2
@entity60 wants @entity2 to stay true to their attacking instincts after being shaken out of their strike in the first leg			2
" we have to be ready for this war , " he told @entity68			0
" they are going to exploit their virtues but we can not change our way of playing like we did in @entity8			0
we lost because we did not play our usual football , not because they won with their approach			0
@entity1 can also call on the likes of @entity78 , @entity79 and young winger @entity80 as they attempt to break down @entity8			1
@entity21 's men got their @entity84 title bid back in full swing with a weekend victory over @entity87 , but midfield talisman @entity88 was injured in the 3 - 1 win and is battling to be fit with a hamstring strain .			1
