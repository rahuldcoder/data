-- @entity1 staged a remarkable fightback on friday to reach the last 16 at @entity3 and avoid following great rival @entity4 in exiting the grass - court grand slam before the end of its first week			1
at two sets down against @entity10 , @entity1 seemed set to suffer the same fate as @entity4 -- who lost to little - known world no. 100 @entity13 on thursday			1
but the man who has won a record 16 grand slam titles showed on @entity17 that he will not give up on his bid to match @entity21 ' leading seven @entity20 crowns			0
@entity10 , ranked 32nd , had beaten the @entity23 superstar once in the last of their previous three meetings in 2009 -- and the big - serving @entity26 was up for the challenge again as he won the first set 6 - 4 and then took the second 7 - 3 in a tie - break			1
@entity1 had to come from two sets down in his first - round @entity3 match in 2010 , and he pulled off the feat for the eighth time in his career after winning the third set 6 - 2 , leveling with a crucial 8 - 6 tie - breaker and then cruising 6 - 1 in the decider after his fellow 30 - year - old called for treatment on a leg injury			1
" it was a tight match and maybe i had a bit of luck on my side			0
it was tough and brutal			0
i fought until the end to stay alive , " said @entity1 , who also retrieved a two - set deficit in his @entity47 quarterfinal against @entity48 earlier this month			0
@entity1 will next take on another experienced opponent in @entity52 's @entity51 , a semifinalist at @entity3 in 2002			1
the 31 - year - old , who also reached the fourth round last year , progressed with an equally battling 1 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 6 - 1 4 - 6 6 - 3 victory against @entity58 17th seed @entity56			1
@entity1 is moving towards a semifinal clash with world no. 1 @entity61 , who had to come from a set down before beating @entity65 28th seed @entity63 earlier on friday			1
" i was a set down , but managed to make the crucial break in the opening game of the second set , and then i thought i played really well , " the defending champion said after winning 4 - 6 6 - 2 6 - 2 6 - 2 in two hours and 48 minutes			2
he will next face fellow @entity72 @entity71 , who beat @entity74 15th seed @entity73 to reach the last 16 at @entity3 for the first time and only the second at any of the four grand slams			0
if he beats @entity71 , @entity61 will take on either @entity26 18th seed @entity78 or @entity81 no. 31 @entity80			2
@entity1 faces a possible quarterfinal against @entity85 26th seed @entity83 or @entity87 's @entity86			0
@entity83 ended the hopes of @entity61 's eighth - seeded compatriot @entity89 , who was aiming to reach the fourth round for the first time since 2008 but went down 6 - 3 6 - 4 3 - 6 6 - 3			1
@entity86 also won in four sets against @entity94 's @entity93 , who famously blew a two - set lead against @entity1 two years ago			2
the 26 - year - old has reached the last 16 of a grand slam for the first time in his career			0
@entity100 has been tipped as @entity21 ' successor , but the big - serving @entity102 bowed out of the tournament after losing 6 - 7 ( 3 - 7 ) 7 - 6 ( 9 - 7 ) 7 - 6 ( 10 - 8 ) 6 - 4 to unseeded @entity105 @entity104 in their delayed second - round match			0
@entity104 , who reached the fourth round in his last appearance in 2010 , will play @entity111 's @entity110 for a place in the last 16 on saturday .			2

world no. 3 @entity1 survives big *scare* against @entity10 at @entity3
@entity23 star comes from two sets down against the @entity26 to reach the fourth round
six - time @entity3 winner will next play another *veteran* in @entity52 's @entity51
he is on course for a semifinal *showdown* with defending champion @entity61
