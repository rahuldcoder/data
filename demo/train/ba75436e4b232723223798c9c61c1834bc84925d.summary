-- @entity1 is a typical 5 - year - old			1
she 's learning to read			0
given a choice , she 'd spend hours on the swings at the playground			0
but unlike her classmates , @entity1 's body is covered in blisters from her scalp to her feet			1
her toes are fused together			0
and her esophagus is lined with so much scar tissue that she can barely swallow			1
that 's because @entity1 was born with a rare connective tissue disorder called epidermolysis bullosa ( @entity20 )			1
the genetic disease causes her skin to break down in response to the slightest friction			0
even minor contact -- the scratch of a fingernail , the tag on the back of her shirt -- causes her skin to tear or to erupt in blisters , leaving 75 % of her body covered in painful , open lesions			0
likewise , @entity20 ravages her organs , damaging her heart , eyes , teeth and esophagus			0
virtually no part of her tiny body is left untouched			0
" it 's literally the worst disease you 've never heard of , " said her father , @entity41			0
an estimated 15,000 children in the @entity46 suffer from @entity20 , according to the @entity47			0
the disease , which occurs when the body lacks the ability to produce a specific type of collagen , is so rare that few treatments exist			2
eventually , @entity20 proves fatal , either through organ failure , secondary skin cancer or infection			0
worst of all , there is no cure			0
but in @entity61 , where @entity1 lives , a group of neighborhood mothers is hoping to change that , and in doing so , they are helping to change the way rare disease research is funded in the @entity46			1
group leaders @entity65 and @entity67 met the @entity68 when their children were enrolled at the @entity70 in @entity71			2
moved by @entity1 's struggle , they felt an urgency to act			1
" i became consumed by it , " said @entity67 , " here was this family in my neighborhood , who was so like my own , except that their little girl had an awful disease no one had heard of			0
" armed with nothing more than their personal e-mail accounts and their networks on @entity87 , they launched @entity88 , an annual @entity89 that raises money for @entity20 research			1
last year , they raised $ 200,000 that went to dr. @entity94 , director of the @entity95 at the @entity96 in @entity97 , who conducts early - stage research on @entity20 treatments			1
@entity67 and @entity65 were confident they could reach out online to find runners -- and donors -- who would participate			0
" we had no media plan or press plan , and no big corporate fund , " said @entity67			2
" we all just networked through our friends and family			0
" sickle cell patient refuses to let disease define her " social media was huge in reaching people both inside and outside our community , " recalled @entity65			1
" we all started fundraising pages , and it was amazing watching people come out of the woodwork			0
" while private foundations often funnel money into disease research , the ability of a community of people to come together so quickly and deliver funding directly to an early stage researcher is a newer phenomenon			2
thirty years ago , the @entity129 provided financial incentives to pharmaceutical companies to develop treatments for rare diseases -- diseases that afflict fewer than 200,000 people			1
according to the @entity136 , there are nearly 7,000 such diseases in the @entity46 , affecting a total of 30 million people			0
today , nearly 1 in 10 @entity46 are currently battling a rare disease			2
but while the @entity129 increased the amount of research into rare diseases , the field is still vastly underfunded			1
so , increasingly , individual patients and their private social networks of friends , co-workers and other casual affiliates are playing a vital role -- not just in raising awareness about a disease but in directing money into r&d for new therapies			2
@entity94 applauds this type of fundraising			0
as a pediatric oncologist and stem cell transplant specialist , his area of focus was initially cancer research , but he saw a challenge -- and an unmet need -- in rare diseases like @entity20			1
a rare disease in the smallest of patients the transferability of his gene therapies from treating cancer to treating @entity20 is an object lesson in itself , as a breakthrough in one disease often leads to new treatments in another			2
" it is a misconception that rare disease research only helps a small number of patients , " said @entity94			1
" finding a treatment for a rare condition often informs treatment for a more common disease			2
" still , @entity94 admits that his greatest allies in finding support for his research are his patients and their families			2
" to fund great leaps in research , there needs to be an urge to succeed , " said @entity94			2
" we get this from parents , and patient communities			0
they are working every minute to find a cure			0
" under his care in 2010 , @entity1 was the eighth child in the world to undergo a stem cell transplant for treatment of @entity20			1
while it has n't cured her symptoms , the treatment was a success at the cellular level , as her bone marrow now produces the collagen that she had been unable to make on her own			0
since then , @entity94 has transplanted a total of 24 children with @entity20 , and continues to conduct research in gene therapy for @entity20 and other rare diseases			1
he describes the money from @entity88 as vitally important to his work			1
" the fact is , we need more brainpower to develop new therapies , " said @entity94			0
" the more people who wake up in the morning and spend their entire day dedicated to studying @entity20 , the faster we can move the research forward			2
" living with a rare disease , making a difference next month , the second annual @entity88 will take place in @entity61			1
@entity67 and @entity226 are hoping to match last year 's total and look forward to once again putting the money in the hands of an early - stage researcher			1
in the meantime , the @entity68 continue treating @entity1 's disease			1
to fight the high risk of infection that comes from having so many open wounds , @entity1 endures a daily bath in a solution of diluted bleach , followed by an application of specialized bandages			1
from start to finish , it takes two hours , and the pain it causes @entity1 is excruciating			1
" it 's physically and emotionally exhausting , " said @entity246 , @entity1 's mother			1
" i wish we had more hugs and kisses than baths and bandages			0

5 - year - old @entity1 suffers from a rare connective tissue disorder
a group of moms banded together and used social media to create @entity88
last year the run raised more than $ 200,000 for medical research
