editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity5 ) -- when people talk about fashion week , they are usually referring to @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity8 and @entity23			1
when i discovered that @entity25 was having its first ever fashion week , i was especially intrigued			1
in a country where the majority of women cover up and similar events in the past have been threatened with fundamentalist attacks , this had to be about promoting @entity35 's textile industry in a strangled economy			1
the majority of @entity35 's population wears traditional @entity39 or @entity40 , are vehemently religious , poor and enjoy about a 50 % illiteracy rate			2
i quickly learned that there are pockets of @entity35 society that have @entity46 sensibilities , which warrants the fashion industry to grow and justifies the need for a fashion week			1
the @entity50 advises against all but essential travel to @entity35			2
after pondering how essential fashion journalism is , against the wishes of my family i flew out to @entity25 in january with the director @entity56 to document an event so incongruous with the @entity35 we see on the news , people thought we 'd made it up			1
this fashion week represented an exclusive elite of @entity64			1
i managed with relative ease to secure carte blanche to film fly - on - the - wall at the event , with the exception of filming people boozing or blaspheming on camera			0
for example , before we left i was warned i 'd better cover up and wear long dresses , which is evident in the film			0
as soon as i arrived i realized that i need n't have worried , that most of the girls at the fashion week dressed like @entity46 girls			1
it was just one example of how @entity35 is misunderstood in the @entity77			2
see the rest of @entity79 at @entity5 for a week i watched relatively scantily - clad models on a runway in a blast - proof basement of a 7 - star hotel just a short drive from the @entity86 militant hubs in the troubled northwest			1
there was a latent atmosphere of volatility : fundamentalists do n't have to try hard to work out that these hotels are crawling with @entity93 and @entity35 liberals 365 days a year			2
as a result , the seats at the fashion shows were often half - empty			2
@entity99 events such as these are few and far between in @entity35			0
a young @entity35 rapper we met while out there told us how he struggles to perform live , as live events are often shut down for risk of militant attacks			0
more than serving as a platform for the textile industry and an attempt at improving @entity35 's world image , the @entity79 was predominantly just something for people to do , a distraction from the adversity of daily life there			1
i spent a week in the care of @entity35 's affluent elite , and my time with them taught me that @entity35 is an acutely divided country of extremes			1
there is a great deal of resentment towards this outmoded elite from the rest of the country			0
there is no middle class as we know it			0
this privileged community lives in compounds with armed guards at their gates			0
they employ a live - in staff and a chauffeur			0
they inhabit a bubble of ersatz @entity46 life			0
one woman told me she thought that fashion , not drones , was the answer to @entity35 's problems			2
whether this is the case , or not , remains to be seen .			0
