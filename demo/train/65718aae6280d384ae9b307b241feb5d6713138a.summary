-- an estimated 2.5 million pilgrims have descended on the city of @entity3 for the @entity5 hajj , said to be the largest annual gathering of people in the world			1
every fit and able @entity9 is obliged by their faith to make the journey at least once in their lifetime			0
but with the rising threat of climate change , there are now calls for both pilgrims and authorities in @entity3 to reduce the environmental damage wrought by this yearly influx of travelers			1
" everyone arrives at the same time , at exactly the same place , and every year there are more and more people , " said dr @entity21 , principal author of " @entity22 for @entity4 , " a booklet promoting ecologically - sustainable practices among @entity4 pilgrims , released earlier this week			1
@entity30 , who is ceo of the @entity32 - based @entity31 , says that as many as 100 million plastic water bottles were dumped by pilgrims during @entity4 last year , according to a study conducted by colleagues at the foundation			1
@entity30 adds that @entity3 's authorities have yet to make adequate provisions for recycling			1
" all the waste from food , all the fumes from coaches traveling around the city , all the energy used for powering local hotels , it has a significant environmental impact , " said @entity30			0
" and that 's before you think about the carbon footprint of all those flying in from halfway around the globe			0
" according to @entity30 , the problem is both practical and cultural			0
while she is eager for local authorities in @entity3 to introduce energy - saving measures , like solar - powered mosques and low - carbon transport initiatives , she says that pilgrims must also become more conscious of their surroundings			1
" unfortunately , the issues of climate change and conservation are not a high priority for many @entity9 , particularly those struggling with poverty in the developing world -- for whom simply getting through the day is the main consideration , " said @entity30 , who hopes that her guide will help emphasize the fundamental link between the theology of @entity5 and the preservation of nature			2
it 's a message that the newly - formed @entity79 ( @entity79 ) is keen to highlight			1
" most religions are implicitly conservationist ... after all , if you think of @entity84 as the creator , then it surely befalls you to take care of his creation , " said @entity80 , secretary - general of the network			2
it is a multi-faith organization that aims to create a worldwide alliance of holy cities committed to sustainable practices , such as banning cars on pilgrimage routes , improving waste management and investing in renewable energy			1
according to the network , over 100 million people a year embark on a religious pilgrimage , making it one of the single greatest reasons for travel worldwide			2
for @entity80 , the environmental challenges presented by pilgrimages at holy sites like @entity3 stem primarily from the trappings of modern living			2
" pilgrimages have become corrupted by consumerism , " he said			0
" for instance , instead of buying millions of plastic bottles , 100 years ago every pilgrim would have traveled with a flask			2
" launched last week in the sacred @entity116 city of @entity117 in @entity118 , the network comprises 12 founding member cities , including @entity120 in @entity121 , where they have pledged to provide clean drinking water for @entity125 pilgrims traveling to the @entity126 there ; and in @entity127 in the @entity32 , the @entity128 says it will install solar panels on the local cathedral			1
" this of course is just the beginning , " said @entity80 , who aims to have at least 300 cities signed up to the network within the next couple of years			2
to join the network , he says , a city 's municipal authority must undertake to work in partnership with the faith community to work towards " shared environmental goals			0
" @entity80 hopes that being a member of the network will be seen as a badge of honor -- " like becoming a @entity147 world heritage site " -- with the threat that those who fail to live up to their commitments will lose membership			0
while @entity3 is not yet a member , @entity80 says " @entity22 for @entity4 , " is the first step in bringing the city on board			1
" i understand that the religious authorities are going through the guide with a fine - tooth comb to make sure it all complies with @entity5 law before giving their official endorsement , " he said			0
he notes that the local government in @entity3 has already displayed a commitment to environmental reform , with the construction of a new metro system capable of transporting 2.5 million pilgrims between shrines currently under way , as well as ongoing discussions to provide water flasks			1
@entity0 was unable to make contact with leaders of @entity3 during the @entity4 holidary period to get comment			1
according to @entity178 , founding director of @entity32 - based pressure group @entity179 , conservation is not just compatible with the teachings of @entity5 , it is integral			0
" the @entity182 says : ' the earth is green and beautiful , and @entity184 has appointed you stewards over it , ' " said @entity178			0
" put simply , being green is a central part of being a good muslim			0
" this is music to the ears of @entity192 , director of policy at the @entity194 , which last year helped produce the " @entity195 " and is an official supporter of the @entity79			2
" religions own up to 8 % of the world 's habitable land and 5 % of commercial forests ; run or contribute to more than half of the world 's schools ; account for up to 7 % of all global investments and offer moral and spiritual guidance to approximately 85 % of all people , " said @entity192			0
" their active engagement on climate change is crucial if we are to realize a greener future for our planet			0

as millions embark on annual @entity4 pilgrimage , concern growns over cost to environment
@entity221 launched @entity79 to promote sustainable sacred cities
