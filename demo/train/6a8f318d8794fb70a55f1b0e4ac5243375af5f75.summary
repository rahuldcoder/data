-- @entity2 football seems to be experiencing something of a time warp			0
@entity5 and @entity6 jostling for top spot , @entity8 languishing in mid-table			1
for 55 minutes of @entity8 's match at bottom club @entity12 on saturday , it appeared that the @entity15 champion 's worst start to a season in 24 years would continue			1
before kickoff , @entity5 had welcomed back 1990 's title - winning manager @entity18 to a non-executive board role by beating @entity21 3 - 1 to regain first place -- at least until @entity6 's trip to @entity24 on sunday			1
@entity12 , still without a permanent manager to replace the sacked @entity26 , then took a shock fifth - minute lead as @entity29 capitalized on some inept @entity8 defending , with @entity30 inexplicably giving him the ball inside the penalty area			1
for new @entity8 manager @entity33 , it raised the prospect of a third successive league defeat -- which last happened to the @entity36 12 years ago			2
but much like his predecessor @entity37 's success in introducing young talent such as @entity40 in the 1990s , @entity33 was rescued by an 18 - year - old making his first @entity15 start			1
@entity43 , yet another @entity44 starlet to make his mark in @entity47 's top flight , first leveled with a cool sidefoot effort 10 minutes after halftime as he burst into the box to collect @entity52 's low cross			0
the midfielder , born in @entity54 to @entity57 - @entity56 parents and who has thus far refused all @entity60 international call - ups , then volleyed a sublime left - footed winner just after the hour mark			0
for @entity33 , who gave @entity8 striker @entity63 his debut when a 16 - year - old at @entity65 , @entity43 has every chance of joining the club 's long line of top stars			1
" i remember giving @entity63 his debut and @entity43 is certainly that quality			0
he 's a top , top player , " the @entity71 said after the match			0
" i would have played him two or three weeks ago but it did n't work			0
we just never quite got the opportunity for different reasons , and i thought today was the right time and it was hard to stop him			0
" he 's going to be a special talent and he showed he 's got goals and ability			0
we will keep his feet on the ground			0
" the result left @entity8 in ninth place , six points behind the club 's bitter rival @entity5			1
for the @entity90 , this is the team 's best start to a season since the advent of the @entity15 in 1992 , with five wins from seven games			2
@entity18 's second stint as manager -- his first was the last time @entity5 won the title -- ended with the sack 17 months ago in the wake of mixed results and @entity104 's eight - match ban for racially abusing @entity52			2
@entity105 struggled in his first season as the club legend 's replacement , not helped by @entity104 's 10 - match ban for biting @entity111 's @entity110			0
that suspension spilled over into this season , but the @entity115 's subsequent return has not hindered @entity5 's impressive start to the campaign -- indeed he has come back with a bang , adding another goal to last weekend 's double against @entity12			1
his partnership with @entity122 continues to blossom , with the young @entity47 forward making it 2 - 0 against @entity21 with his sixth in the league and eighth overall			2
" the two boys up front are as good as any in the league , so you know you 're always going to be in with a chance with them two , " @entity105 said			0
veteran @entity132 celebrated his 639th appearance for @entity5 -- putting him seventh on the club 's all - time list -- with his 99th @entity15 goal , netting from the penalty spot before halftime			1
palace boss @entity139 was aggrieved by that decision , with @entity142 's tug on @entity143 appearing to be on the edge of the area , but had the small consolation of seeing his second - bottom side edge the second half thanks to a late header by record signing @entity150			0
@entity152 bounced back from the midweek @entity154 lesson against @entity155 by moving up to third place with victory by the same 3 - 1 scoreline against @entity65			1
on - loan @entity60 striker @entity159 gave the home fans a sense of @entity162 vu as he put @entity65 ahead , with @entity47 goalkeeper @entity163 again in question -- as he had twice been against @entity166 champion @entity155			2
but @entity168 striker @entity167 leveled and @entity169 made it 2 - 1 on halftime , before the @entity172 's 69th - minute penalty hit the post and cruelly bounced into the net off the head of goalkeeper @entity176			1
@entity177 beat @entity152 last weekend , but this time could only draw 0 - 0 at promoted @entity179 in a result that left both sides comfortably mid-table			2
@entity182 moved out of the bottom three with a 1 - 0 win at @entity184 thanks to a second - half goal from former @entity177 striker @entity186 , who came on to replace the injured @entity187			0
@entity188 joined @entity177 and @entity8 on 10 points after winning 2 - 1 at promoted @entity190 , with both goals from on - loan @entity193 striker @entity192 .			1

@entity43 helps @entity8 come from behind at @entity12
*teenager* scores both goals in first @entity15 start , which ends in a 2 - 1 victory
champion united six points behind leader @entity5 , which also wins
@entity152 rebounds from two defeats with 3 - 1 victory over @entity65
