it 's another small sliver of information in the expanse of mystery surrounding @entity4			1
a failed satellite phone call suggests the missing passenger jet may have turned south slightly earlier than previously thought during its enigmatic journey , @entity9 authorities said thursday			1
after flight 370 dropped off radar on march 8 , @entity12 ground staff tried to make contact with the plane using a satellite phone , @entity9 deputy prime minister @entity10 said at a news conference in the @entity9 capital , @entity20			1
the attempt was unsuccessful , he said , but subsequent analysis of the failed call has given experts a better idea of the aircraft 's position and where it was traveling			1
the latest analysis of the available data has put a focus on southern parts of the search area in the @entity34 , @entity10 told reporters			1
@entity4 vanished with 239 people on board during a flight that was meant to go from @entity39 , @entity40 , to @entity41			2
the search operation , described by @entity9 officials as the largest in history , has so far turned up no debris from the plane			1
international aviation experts have relied on information from radar and satellites to try to plot the @entity52 's course , concluding that it went down in a remote part of the southern @entity34 , far off @entity9 's west coast			1
the experts are sticking to the same vast search zone announced in june , @entity10 said at the news conference thursday			1
but some of the information that the analysts now have suggests that areas of the zone farther to the south may be of " particular interest , " he said , noting that the focus of the search continues to be refined as experts keep reviewing the available data			1
uncertainty over location of turn @entity4 was last detected by radar flying northwest over the sea between @entity40 and the @entity74 island of @entity75			2
a series of subsequent communications between satellite systems and the errant plane -- known as " handshakes " -- determined that at some point , @entity4 turned south toward the southern @entity34			1
it was initially assumed that the southern turn took place at the northwestern tip of @entity75			0
but the team of experts has since said there 's no conclusive evidence about where the turn to the south took place			2
to calculate the current search area , they said they took two approaches to the uncertainty surrounding the turn			0
they analyzed the satellite data using a range of assumed locations for the turn , and also without any assumption of where the turn took place			0
the final radar detection of @entity4 , by the @entity111 military , occurred nearly an hour after the plane had veered off its planned course			1
three minutes later , a satellite handshake indicated that the plane was still traveling northwest			2
the unanswered phone call took place 14 minutes after the handshake , according to information previously released by @entity9 authorities			1
just over an hour later , a second handshake suggested that the plane had turned and was heading south or southeast			2
it 's unclear from @entity10 ' comments thursday how much more clarity the analysts now have on the timing and location of the turn			0
the crucial question of why the aircraft flew wildly off course also remains unanswered			2
without the aircraft 's wreckage and flight recorders , investigators are struggling to piece together what happened			2
how flight attendants keep flying after air disasters undersea volcanoes the search for the remains of the plane and the people on board remains primarily focused on a 60,000 - square - kilometer area , roughly the size of @entity147 , in the southern @entity34			1
an underwater search that will involve three ships is expected to start in the area next month , using a range of sophisticated sonar equipment			0
the process is expected to take about 12 months , @entity10 said			0
officials hope as much searching as possible can be done in the next few months before weather conditions are likely to deteriorate , he said			0
ships have already been mapping the undersea terrain in the isolated swath of ocean to help the searchers			0
much of the geography of the area was previously unknown before @entity4 's disappearance drew attention there			1
the mapping process has revealed dramatic new challenges for the search teams			0
the " remarkable geographic features " discovered by the surveying include at least two volcanoes and an area where the seafloor drops away from a depth of 600 meters ( 1,970 feet ) to 6,600 meters ( 21,650 feet ) over a short distance , @entity10 said			0
" it would not be safe to put the towed sonar equipment into the water if we did n't have this kind of information about the seabed , " he said			0
how long will the search continue ? cost of search to be shared @entity10 spoke after meeting with @entity111 transport minister @entity184 and @entity186 vice transport minister @entity185			0
@entity184 said at the news conference that @entity40 's financial contributions to the search will match @entity9 's commitment			1
@entity9 has estimated a yearlong underwater search will cost $ 48 million			2
the @entity191 is overseeing the underwater search at @entity40 's request			0
the majority of the people on board @entity4 were @entity186			0
all countries involved remain " cautiously optimistic " that the wreckage of the missing plane will be found , @entity10 said			0
@entity111 couple charged with alleged theft from @entity4 passengers			0

official : *airline* staff tried to reach the plane by satellite phone after it dropped off radar
the call failed , but later analysis has given experts a better idea of @entity4 's position
the @entity34 search zone for the missing aircraft remains the same
some areas a little to the south may be of " particular interest , " @entity9 deputy pm says
