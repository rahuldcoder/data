-- @entity1 says it has notified all 767 aircraft operators about cracks found on two @entity5 767 - 300 planes , and by @entity6 will recommend more frequent maintenance checks			1
@entity5 found the cracks in large pylons that hold engines onto the wings of two of its 767 - 300 aircraft , which @entity1 currently recommends inspecting every 1,500 takeoff and landing cycles			1
" @entity1 will recommend decreasing the number of flight cycles between inspections of the pylon mid spar fitting from every 1,500 flight cycles to possibly as low as every 400 flight cycles , " the company said late wednesday			0
about 260 planes constructed in the same manner as the damaged @entity5 aircraft could be affected by the recommendation , @entity1 said			1
@entity5 spokesman @entity27 said the problem was first discovered on one of its 767 - 300s about two weeks ago during a maintenance check targeting other parts of the aircraft			1
the airline then found cracking on one more 767 - 300 after inspecting a total of 56 aircraft -- 767 - 300 and 767 - 200s -- a process @entity5 completed monday night			1
" we found these issues when it 's best to find them , which is early on , " said @entity27			0
the airline has sent the first damaged pylon to a metallurgy lab to try to determine why it cracked			0
" until that metallurgy testing is completed no one knows what the cause is , " said @entity27			0
the damaged planes were among @entity53 's older aircraft , @entity27 added			0
@entity53 flies @entity1 767 - 300s on international routes as well as long - haul domestic routes			2
the 767 - 200s fly primarily transcontinental routes			2
airlines have previously found similar cracks at the holes where the pylon attaches to the wing , which led @entity1 and the @entity64 five years ago to recommend checks every 1,500 cycles			2
at that time , when the @entity64 issued an airworthiness directive it said , " we are issuing this ( directive ) to prevent fatigue cracking in the primary strut structure and reduced structural integrity of the strut , which could result in separation of the strut and engine			0
