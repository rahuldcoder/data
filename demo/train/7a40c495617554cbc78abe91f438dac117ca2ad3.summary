-- a police officer in @entity2 , @entity3 , asks that local law enforcement be exempt from enforcing the state 's new immigration law in a lawsuit filed in federal court on thursday			1
officer @entity9 claims in the suit that the law will " seriously impede law enforcement investigations and facilitate the successful commission of crimes			1
" he also says there are no " race - neutral criteria or basis to suspect or identify who is lawfully in the @entity20 , " including a person 's proximity to the @entity24 border , linguistic characteristics and capabilities , skin color , clothing worn or the type of vehicle driven			1
the law , signed by @entity3 gov. @entity32 on april 23 , allows police to ask anyone for proof of legal @entity20 residency			1
@entity32 and others who support the law have said it does not involve racial profiling or any other illegal acts			1
" racial profiling is illegal , " @entity32 said after signing the bill			1
" it is illegal in @entity20 , and it 's certainly illegal in @entity3			2
" read the complaint ( @entity45 ) but @entity9 's suit says the law " is the product of racial bias aimed specifically at @entity49 " and places every @entity52 within the state at risk of losing his or her constitutional rights			2
@entity32 , @entity3 attorney general @entity57 , the city of @entity2 and @entity60 attorney @entity59 are named in the suit			2
@entity9 asks that local law enforcement be exempt " from engaging any immigration stops , questioning , detention , citing or any law enforcement activity reserved to the federal government			2
" @entity9 , 45 , is a naturalized @entity20 citizen who was born in @entity24 and immigrated with his parents when he was 5 years old , attorney @entity68 said			0
@entity70 spokesman sgt. @entity69 declined to comment on the case because city policies prevent employees from discussing pending litigation			0
but he said @entity9 has worked for the department since 1995 and patrols @entity2 's south side			0
@entity68 said his client has spent years working to break down barriers between the @entity80 and the predominantly @entity52 community			0
" all this law does is put the barrier back up			0
... it takes away trust and the rapport and relationships , " he said thursday			0
spokespeople for @entity32 and @entity57 did not return requests for comment .			0
