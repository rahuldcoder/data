-- the @entity2 received a candidate vaccine virus for swine flu from one institution friday , spokesman @entity1 said in an e-mail			1
the @entity2 estimates more than 100,000 people have had swine flu in the @entity8			1
the @entity2 and the @entity10 have also created a candidate vaccine virus for swine flu , also known as 2009 @entity12 , using reverse genetics , he said			1
" suitable viruses will hopefully be sent to manufacturers by end of next week , " @entity1 wrote			1
once that happens , vaccine makers will tweak the virus and have " pilot lots " of vaccine ready to be tested by mid- to late june			2
several thousand cases have been reported nationally , but the @entity2 estimates more than 100,000 people have had swine flu in the @entity8 , said dr. @entity25 , interim deputy director for science and public health program at the @entity2 , in a news conference friday			1
most of these people probably have not been officially tested			0
the first sample virus came from a lab run by virologist @entity33 at @entity34 , in @entity35 , @entity36			0
@entity33 told @entity0 thursday that she had just packaged four viruses that she considers vaccine candidates and sent the samples to the @entity2 's headquarters in @entity41 , @entity42 , via courier			2
earlier this week , a @entity45 scientist , dr. @entity44 , also claimed to have produced a virus that might be used in a swine flu vaccine			1
but @entity1 said the methods @entity44 used were not suitable and that his virus was not considered a viable candidate			2
@entity33 's samples will likely get more attention			0
for the past five years her lab in @entity35 has produced elements of the seasonal vaccine that 's given to tens of millions of @entity8 each year			0
she says the process she 's using with the @entity12 virus is virtually identical to the process her lab uses when working on that seasonal vaccine			2
the virus used in vaccines is not the actual virus that infects people , but rather a hybrid that 's been genetically modified to make it safer , and to give it the ability to multiply more quickly -- a crucial factor when it comes to manufacturing large quantities			0
@entity33 's method of achieving this has a decidedly old - fashioned feel			0
she first injects a sample of " wild virus " -- in this case , @entity12 virus she got from the @entity2 , originally culled from a child who was infected in @entity80 this spring -- and then injects a sample of another flu strain that 's known for its ability to rapidly multiply in eggs			1
for that , @entity33 is using a strain with the exotic sounding name of @entity88 157			0
( that 's @entity34 as in " @entity90 ; " it 's a hybrid of an @entity93 seasonal virus and the so - called " @entity95 strain , " a / pr / 8/34 , that 's used to speed the growth of seasonal flu vaccine )			2
together in the egg , the viruses swap genes			1
in a laborious series of steps , @entity33 's team guides the changes by adding antibodies that eliminate the surface proteins of the @entity93 virus			0
the end result is a virus with the exterior proteins of the @entity12 swine flu -- so the immune system recognizes it -- but with the inner mechanics -- the fast - growth ability -- of @entity116			1
another method of creating a candidate virus also mixes wild virus with a second , fast - growing strain , but instead of growing them in eggs , lets the viruses mingle in a special solution while scientists manipulate them through a complex technique called reverse genetics			1
in 2005 , dr. @entity129 and dr. @entity130 at @entity131 in @entity132 , used reverse genetics to produce a vaccine against the @entity136 avian flu virus			1
@entity129 has been working to produce a candidate virus against @entity12 as well , but told @entity0 the virus is growing slower than expected , and that it would likely be a few weeks before a suitable strain is ready to be sent to the @entity2			1
with any candidate strain , @entity2 virologists will perform tests to see if the new virus can induce an immune response against the wild @entity12 strain			2
that 's done by using a solution derived from the blood of ferrets , whose susceptibility to flu is similar to that of humans , and also by deliberately trying to infect live ferrets			0
if test results are acceptable , the @entity2 will forward samples of the virus to various manufacturers			2
those companies will fine - tune the virus for their own production methods , and produce small " pilot lots " of vaccine that can be tested in animals , and possibly people , for effectiveness and safety			0
only after those tests are complete would the @entity2 , @entity171 and other government health authorities decide whether to recommend mass production			0
even in the fastest - moving scenarios , that step is n't likely to occur before late june or even july			0
@entity0 's @entity177 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity2 received a candidate vaccine virus for swine flu friday
@entity2 : suitable viruses will hopefully be sent to manufacturers by end of next week
in one vaccine method , viruses swap genes in egg
another technique uses reverse genetics instead of growing viruses in eggs
