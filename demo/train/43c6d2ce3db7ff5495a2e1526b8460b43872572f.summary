-- for @entity2 , owning a bridal shop means serving customers who are planning one of the happiest days of their lives			1
it 's a job she loves			2
" she 's the @entity10 , " said her husband , @entity8			1
but since october 16 , the couple 's lives have been turned upside down			2
ever since news broke that nurse @entity15 had visited their @entity17 store just before being diagnosed with @entity19 , the fallout has been unrelenting			1
the couple 's coming @entity20 , a business they cultivated for nearly 25 years , is dark , they say , mainly thanks to @entity19 hysteria			1
" it 's a little hard to believe that something like @entity19 from halfway around the world can affect our lives right here in @entity31 , " said @entity24			1
" the world is clearly smaller than we think			0
" on sunday , the bridal shop looked like a " @entity35 " set			1
bright blue light beamed from five ultraviolet ray machines in an operation designed to eliminate any possible trace of the ebola virus			0
it 's called a torch uv system from @entity44 - based @entity43 the @entity45 say a team spent about five hours performing the service free of charge			1
now , the fascinating part : the @entity50 told the family the cleaning effort was unnecessary			2
" you do n't have to do it if you do n't want to , that 's what they told us , " @entity2 said			1
even if the virus was present , health officials say it does n't live long on surfaces			2
dr. @entity62 , the @entity63 medical director , also told @entity0 the cleanup was n't needed			1
" it was the same thing they told us about closing , " @entity2 added			1
' i 'm hoping that this will ease everybody 's mind ' the couple say they did it because of " public scrutiny			2
" " i 'm hoping that this will ease everybody 's mind that if there 's anything floating in my store that it 's gon na be gone , ' @entity2 said			1
the couple say that by shutting their doors and scrubbing the shop , they hope to " get rid of any " stigmatization			2
or will they ? despite their efforts , the @entity45 worry they may have to get rid of their entire inventory , including hundreds of dresses			2
" i think that 's probably what i 'll have to do , " @entity24 said			2
for now , their insurance company is suggesting they may not be covered , saying a virus such as @entity19 may be an exclusion			1
yet , the @entity45 say , there 's no evidence the virus was in the shop			1
he 's also worried about possible lawsuits from customers			2
he is n't sure why			2
yet he says nothing would surprise him			0
it 's unexpected craziness , " said his wife , @entity105			0
" some people are going over and beyond to panic			0
" travel restrictions @entity2 is listed as a " contact " with @entity112 because she waited on her in the bridal shop			1
the @entity50 told her that for three days , she was n't allowed to leave her home			0
now , the restrictions have been loosened			0
she can leave her house but can not use public transportation and must tell officials if she wants to leave the county			0
someone still comes to her home to record her temperature once a day			0
her 21 - day oversight will last about two more weeks before it can be lifted			0
but even though her husband , who works at @entity127 , and their 10 - year - old son have no official restrictions , they 're also affected			0
" he was supposed to go to an amusement park to do some @entity132 activities			0
he was supposed to go to a @entity134 game , ( but ) we ca n't do any , " she said			0
" they 're not under quarantine , but because of the stigma that we would feel ... and getting scrutinized and being told we were reckless with public safety , we did n't want that , " she added			0
when she first found out about @entity112 , @entity2 called her son 's school principal to let her know			1
" i wanted to make sure she was comfortable that my son was at school , and she was , " @entity2 said			1
then , as news spread , the school closed as a precaution to get scrubbed down			0
the principal told her that parents were calling with concerns			0
" they asked me what can i do , " @entity2 said			1
" they were n't telling me i can not send my son to school but ... i did choose to keep him home just so all the parents , teachers , families are not panicking			1
" and while @entity2 says she 's been getting a lot of support from a diocese and friends , there are others who do n't want her son there , for now			1
" i do n't want my son to be treated as if he 's full of germs			1
... there 've been some parents that said if this particular child would come to school that 's associated with this @entity19 ... they will not send their kids to school			1
" " i do n't want to disrupt everybody else 's learning			1
i want everybody to go to school and feel comfortable			0
" his parents are picking up his homework so he does n't fall behind			0
trying to cope meantime , questions keep coming			0
some of them , the couple says , are baseless , according to what health officials are telling them			0
" a lot of it is just nonsense			0
... did i use the same tape measure , measuring those bridesmaids as i used on their bridesmaids ? ... that 's not how this disease is caught , " @entity2 said			1
for now , from both a personal and business standpoint , the couple are counting the days when they can get everything back to normal			0
" even though i feel good , we have to be cautious , " she said			0
she 's calling customers , delivering dresses and making arrangements for alterations as needed			2
" no one will be out of their dresses			0
