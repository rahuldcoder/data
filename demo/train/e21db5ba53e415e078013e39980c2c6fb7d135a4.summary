-- when it came to promoting other women in politics , @entity1 was a disappointment			1
in fact , her main legacy for women was merely that she was a woman holding the position of prime minister for 11Â½ years			1
my son was 5 years old when @entity1 first won election as prime minister , the first woman to do so			1
by the time she left office , he was a young man of 17			0
he did n't remember a country with a male prime minister			1
as a feminist and women 's rights campaigner who opposed many of @entity1 's policies , i am still trying to work out how i feel about her			1
as prime minister , @entity1 did almost nothing to promote women 's rights actively , but at the same time , an entire generation grew up assuming it was normal to have a woman as prime minister			1
during @entity1 's tenure , i interviewed sir @entity32 , speaker of the @entity33 , for a documentary i was working on			1
@entity32 told me an anecdote about his grandchildren , a boy and girl of around 8 and 11			0
the children were dressing up in the speaker 's robes , " playing parliaments			0
" the speaker said he overheard his grandson say , " i 'll pretend to be prime minister			1
" his granddaughter retorted , " do n't be silly , i 'm going to be the prime minister -- only women can be prime ministers ! " a woman prime minister had become so much part of the @entity53 way of life that for two or three weeks after @entity1 left office the media had become so accustomed to referring to the prime minister as " she " and " her " that several times tv and radio journalists slipped up on air and had to correct themselves and refer to the incoming prime minister @entity63 as " he " and " him			1
" in the early 1980s , i founded and led the all - party 300 group campaign to get more women elected -- we had 43 branches in @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			2
@entity1 attended a couple of 300 group functions and spoke in support of the campaign for more women in @entity78			1
at an event to unveil a plaque to @entity81 , the first woman mp to take her seat in @entity78 , i heard @entity1 refer in her speech to the @entity33 as " a dreadfully male - dominated place			1
" such sentiments were the exception rather than the rule for her			0
i do n't think she understood women 's rights , and her record of appointing only one other woman to her @entity95 for a brief period was desperately disappointing			2
@entity1 had such command over her @entity98 that if she had chosen to do so she could have advanced large numbers of qualified women into public and political posts			1
she chose not to do so			0
it was a missed opportunity			0
once i was invited to lunch by former prime minister @entity105			1
@entity1 had defeated @entity105 to become head of the @entity98 in 1975			2
he never referred to her by name during lunch			0
instead he referred to her as " that woman			0
" he had invited seven of us as guests , including pop singer @entity115			0
it was a sunny summer afternoon			0
we ate lunch out on the terrace of @entity105 's garden at his beautiful @entity121 house in the country town of @entity123 , @entity124			0
conversation ranged over @entity72 , @entity127 politics and music			0
knowing about my work with the @entity139 campaign , he suddenly turned to me and bristling with anger said : " i tell you one thing @entity142 , you 'll never see another woman prime minister in this country in your lifetime after ' that woman			1
' " @entity1 triggered strong emotions for and against her			2
she presided over a ruthless era in @entity53 politics			1
the reactions on social media at the news of her death are a @entity152 cocktail of people 's views -- not just vitriol , but vicious , misogynist vocabulary from people who are quite reasonable and rational in other circumstances			0
@entity1 is well - known for her quotation of the @entity161 after her 1979 election victory			2
the prayer includes the lines , " where there is discord , may we bring harmony			0
" what she achieved was the precise opposite of this			0
so what will be the @entity1 legacy ? i once asked the then - @entity177 ambassador to @entity178 what legacy he thought @entity180 left to modern @entity177			2
his reply ? " too soon to tell			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			2

@entity184 : besides being prime minister , @entity1 did little to promote women in politics
@entity184 says a generation in @entity53 grew up knowing only a female prime minister
she says like many , she feels *ambivalence* toward @entity1 , a *divisive* but *influential* *leader*
@entity184 : so powerful , she could have advanced women in politics but chose not to do so
