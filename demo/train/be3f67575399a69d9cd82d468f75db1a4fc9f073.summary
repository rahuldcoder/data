-- the tragedy of the train derailment in @entity3 , @entity4 , has brought home just how small our world has become			2
oil that was drilled in @entity11 's @entity10 oil fields is loaded onto rail cars and passes through a small @entity15 community and shatters their world in an instant			1
all my thoughts and best wishes go out to the families and emergency responders in the midst of this human and environmental catastrophe			0
everyone is touched by this man - made disaster -- 20 killed , 30 missing -- because so many communities have a rail line running right through the middle of town			1
here in @entity11 , like all over the @entity34 and @entity15 , towns grew up around the railroad lines			1
they brought people in to help settle the state and shipped the farm and manufacturing products to other parts of the world			0
but the increase in the amount of volatile crude oil being transported by rail from @entity11 's @entity10 fields has brought a new and troubling set of problems to the debate about our continued dependency on fossil fuels , and particularly oil , as an energy source			1
railroad engineers did not have transporting oil in mind when they laid out the routes			2
they did not avoid population centers , rivers , or environmentally sensitive areas			0
they were only concerned with getting from @entity64 in the most efficient manner possible			0
in fact , trains carrying oil tanker cars run just two blocks from my office , right through the heart of @entity73 , @entity11			1
rail is the most efficient way to move freight , and @entity77 is a big fan of rail for transporting people and conventional freight			2
but moving extreme fossil fuels , like @entity10 or @entity84 tar sands , is a different story entirely			0
these fuels are " extreme " because they are more toxic and more carbon intensive than conventional oil			0
they are also more dangerous to transport than conventional sources of oil			1
production in the @entity10 fields has increased nearly 10 times since 2011			1
to move all this crude , oil rail companies are running longer , heavier trains			1
and they are running them farther than ever before , bringing crude to refineries on the @entity102 and @entity104 coasts			1
the regulatory framework for train safety was n't designed for crude oil trains , and the rail and safety infrastructure is out of date and not up to the task			1
a state transportation safety spokesman in @entity113 this week said that the @entity115 disaster is " on the same parallel as a tractor - trailer accident			0
it 's private commerce and we do n't get involved			2
" this catastrophe proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that the transportation of @entity10 shale requires much more vigilant oversight			0
it 's too early to draw conclusions from the ongoing catastrophe in @entity3 , but there 's one simple lesson that we should not ignore			0
bakken shale , tar sands , and other extreme fossil fuels threaten our towns and our communities			2
we ca n't afford the additional cost , in safety or pollution that these fuels bring			0
and with growing efficiency and with renewable sources of energy , we do n't need them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 .			2

@entity147 : many communities have rail lines running right through them
@entity147 : @entity11 crude oil loaded onto trains causes a tragedy in @entity15
@entity11 oil production rose by 10 times since 2011 , more and and heavier trains needed
it 's too dangerous , he says . trains go through towns and were n't designed for oil
