since 1941 , comic book fans have followed the exploits of teenaged @entity2 and his friends			1
this july , they 'll find out how he dies			0
" @entity9 " # 36 hits stores on july 16 , and @entity11 can reveal exclusively that it tells the story of how @entity2 sacrifices himself to save a friend			1
few details are known , but it seems fitting that @entity2 would go out a hero			1
the 37th issue one week later will end the series			1
the " @entity9 " series has been telling the stories of possible future @entity2 scenarios for the past few years , and so @entity2 will continue to be alive in the comics set in the present day			1
@entity11 spoke with @entity22 ceo @entity21 ( son of @entity2 creator @entity24 ) about the upcoming issues			1
@entity11 : can you explain the " @entity9 " series for the uninitiated ? @entity24 : " @entity9 " is @entity2 's future -- it gives readers a look into what his life would be like after high school and college , which has never really been explored			1
most fans are familiar with @entity2 as a high schooler , hanging out at @entity38 's @entity37 with his friends			1
" @entity9 " shows what happens when @entity2 becomes an adult and starts dealing with grownup issues			1
each issue is normally split into two storylines -- one telling a tale of @entity2 married to @entity47 another with him ending up with @entity48			1
the final issue , however , will show readers @entity2 's final fate in both timelines -- and they 're the same			1
@entity11 : why kill @entity2 ? @entity24 : i think it 's the natural conclusion to the " @entity9 " series			1
@entity2 dies as he lived -- heroically			1
he dies saving the life of a friend , and does it in his usual selfless way			0
@entity2 has always been a representation of us -- the best of us			1
our strengths and our faults			0
writer @entity67 , with input from myself , has crafted an emotional , impactful and classic story that i know will survive the test of time			0
this is n't a random one - off or " what - if " story that we 're doing as a gag			0
this is the story that we mapped out carefully and with much thought			0
this is the death of @entity2 as we see it , and we 're treating it with that same level of gravitas and import			1
it 's a once - in - a - lifetime event , and we are being very considerate about it			0
@entity11 : what are you hoping to accomplish with this storyline ? @entity24 : first and foremost , like with anything we do at @entity2 , we want to tell a great , memorable story			2
that being said , this story in particular is of the utmost importance to us as a company and as a keeper of the @entity2 brand			2
we want to not only show how @entity2 's life ends , but also what he means to the world around him			1
we want to celebrate his life			0
after the events of " @entity9 " # 36 , fans will leap forward a year to see the aftermath , and how his friends have moved on since his surprising death			1
what 's @entity106 doing ? how are @entity48 and @entity47 dealing with the loss ? it 's not about the attention - grab of the death but about telling a great , evocative story that reminds people why this character is important to the fabric of pop culture -- and showing how heroic a normal guy like @entity2 can be , and how important it is to realize that			1
this is n't a story we 're going to retcon a few weeks from now			0
this is the conclusion to the " @entity9 " story and timeline , and it will allow us as a company and the world to take a moment to look at @entity2 's life as a whole and recognize him as one of the most important characters -- not in just comics -- but in popular culture			1
we want people to feel the same emotional roller coaster we felt putting this story together -- to feel the range of emotions , from happiness , sadness , anger , joy and pride			0
we want people to react to this in a strong way because @entity2 is so important to them			2
@entity11 : how do you hope fans will react ultimately ? @entity24 : we expect some level of shock , outrage and surprise -- followed by understanding			0
as a company , we are not afraid to take risks			0
we 're not scared to shake things up to draw attention to the great stories we 're building here at @entity2			2
i hope fans will be intrigued by this news , pick up the issues in july and realize they 've been given one of the best comics on the stands			0
they 'll be handed a piece of comic book history , featuring some of the most well - known characters in the world saying goodbye to an icon			0
we want fans to talk about this for years to come			0
we think this story is bigger than anything we 've ever done -- it 's bold , dramatic and best of all , a fitting end to the life of @entity2			1
@entity11 : what do you think @entity22 has been doing by shaking things up over the recent years ? @entity2 : we 're a sleeping giant			2
years ago , before i stepped in as ceo , @entity2 was seen as a dormant , nostalgia brand stuck in amber			2
we were in suspended animation			0
people thought the stories were still set in the ' 50s ! now , while the characters -- like @entity48 , @entity2 , @entity47 , @entity106 and @entity192 -- are at their core the same , @entity194 has changed			2
it 's caught up with the times			0
the town of @entity194 you read about now is like any other in @entity200			0
it 's diverse , it 's not problem - free , and it represents @entity200 in an honest way			0
@entity2 is about being welcoming , diverse and entertaining			2
we 've managed to strike that balance in our storytelling for the last five years and managed to not only get attention , but keep people entertained			0
from the introduction of @entity211 , the first regular gay character in comics to now , the death of @entity2 , we 've not been afraid to take risks			1
the big thing is , though , our risks pay off because the stories , art and execution are spot - on			0
we back up what we say			0
@entity11 : what will be the long - term impact of this story ? @entity24 : well , this is the end			0
this is how @entity2 dies in the pages of " @entity9			1
" we will not be retconning , reversing or backtracking on this story in terms of " @entity9			2
" the main @entity2 line , however , telling stories of @entity2 in high school , will continue			2
" @entity234 " [ the " @entity2 " zombie series ] will continue , and we will keep on taking risks with different and new interpretations of our characters			1
but as far as we see it , this is how @entity2 dies			2
that 's how we approached this story and how we 're treating it .			0

@entity2 will die in upcoming issue of " @entity9 "
