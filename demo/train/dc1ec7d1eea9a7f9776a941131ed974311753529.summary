@entity0 -- to win in november , @entity2 must emerge from his first debate with president @entity4 as the leader on this campaign 's defining question : which candidate do voters trust more to handle the economy ? " he has to paint a compelling picture of a better economic future and why he can lead us there and president @entity4 ca n't , " @entity12 pollster @entity11 told @entity1 when asked to define @entity2 's paramount debate challenge			1
@entity21 pollster @entity20 made the same point but in more colorful language : " if @entity2 loses this issue , then he is toast			2
" how to watch , clip and share the debate yes , there are other important challenges for both the @entity12 challenger and the @entity21 incumbent as they share the debate stage for the first of three encounters			0
@entity2 , for example , must pass a test all challengers face when appearing side by side with an incumbent : look and sound like a credible alternative , like a president			1
the @entity12 standard - bearer also needs to quiet the jitters among @entity12 who see the presidential campaign trending in a direction they worry could hurt down - ballot			0
candidate ' tells ' a cue to debate performance for the president , some aides and advisers worry most about coming across as smug , or too dismissive , of criticism of his economic stewardship			0
his burden also includes the challenge of showing how the next four years would be different without helping his challenger 's case that the approach of the last four years was misguided			1
but given the state of the race , very competitive but with an @entity4 advantage in several of the most important battleground states , veteran strategists in both parties agree the heavier burden in the first debate is on @entity2			1
five things to watch for tonight and they agree his overriding challenge is to seize the upper hand in the economy argument			0
the candidates enter the @entity0 debate tied on that key question			0
our new @entity1 / @entity82 poll asked likely voters which candidate would better handle the economy			2
@entity4 was the choice of 49 % , @entity2 of 48 %			1
pollster @entity11 said the key in winning over undecided and persuadable voters is for @entity2 to make the case the president 's economic proposals are " government - driven " and that @entity2 's rely on small business and the broader private sector as engines of growth			1
@entity2 : debates are n't about a win the president 's response , according to aides familiar with his debate preparations , will be twofold : cast @entity2 's proposals as little or nothing new , a throwback to favor - the - rich @entity12 policies that the president argues contributed to the economic ditch , and raise questions about @entity2 's understanding of , and empathy for , the struggles of working - and middle - class families			1
the format should offer voters a clear contrast : three segments on the economy one on health care one on the role of government and one on governing leadership and style			0
as always , there is the debate season sideshow known as the expectations game			0
it can be fun to watch , especially when high - profile surrogates like @entity131 gov. @entity130 ignore the @entity2 campaign talking points and instead promise a campaign - changing debate performance			2
fun , but in the end meaningless			0
the surrogates and spinners are n't on the debate stage			0
this is about @entity4 and @entity2 , their first of three debates a test of whether the challenger can make a persuasive case that he has a better economic plan or the incumbent can sell voters on staying the course			1
10 questions you would ask at the presidential debate @entity4 : ' they 're making me do my homework ' latino vote in @entity159 up for grabs			2

campaign 's defining question is who voters trust to handle economy
@entity2 faces same question all challengers do -- is he credible alternative ?
@entity4 faces challenge of showing how next four years would be different from last four
bottom line is the debate rests on which of two men on stage are more persuasive
