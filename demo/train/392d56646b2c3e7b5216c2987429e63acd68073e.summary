-- @entity4 has returned in two patients who doctors hoped had been cured of the virus following bone marrow transplants , the @entity2 researcher who treated them said saturday			1
the hiv virus became undetectable in both patients approximately eight months after the transplant			1
the men remained on antiretroviral therapy until the spring of 2013			0
" the return of detectable levels of @entity4 in our patients is disappointing , but scientifically significant , " dr. @entity14 , a researcher at @entity15 in @entity2 , said in a statement			1
" we have demonstrated @entity4 can be reduced to undetectable levels by very sensitive research assays and the virus persists			1
" the virus became detectable in one patient in august -- 12 weeks after ceasing antiretroviral therapy			2
in the other man , @entity4 became detectable this month , 32 weeks after antiretroviral therapy ceased			1
" through this research we have discovered the @entity4 reservoir is deeper and more persistent than previously known and that our current standards of probing for @entity4 may not be sufficient to inform us if long - term @entity4 remission is possible if antiretroviral therapy is stopped , " @entity14 said			1
" we have also learned that there may be an important long - lived @entity4 reservoir outside the blood compartment			2
" dr. @entity37 , another researcher at @entity15 , said the cases demonstrate that the virus may persist even when there is no evidence in the blood			2
" we need to develop better and more sensitive tools to detect the virus as we continue to pursue novel strategies for @entity4 eradication , " he said			1
" our results also show that the immune system can play a major role in reducing the viral reservoir , but may not be able to do the job alone			0
it is likely that a combination of drugs and immune therapies that target the reservoir will be needed to establish long - term remission of hiv infection			0
" in july , when the cases were first reported at the @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63 , experts stopped short of calling the two cured and said the treatment is not a viable option for the majority of @entity4 patients			1
after the patients ceased antiretroviral therapy , they were tested for @entity4 every seven to 10 days			1
both resumed antiretroviral therapy after the virus was detected			2
they are in good health and the virus is suppressing as expected			0
@entity15 researchers will continue to monitor the patients and measure their @entity4 levels as part of a new study of the very early initiation of antiretroviral therapy after @entity4 rebound			1
the men , whose identities were withheld , had been on antiretroviral drug therapy for years before being diagnosed with lymphoma , a cancer of the lymph nodes			0
both underwent intensive chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplants to treat the cancer			1
they remained on antiretroviral therapy			0
approximately four months after the transplant doctors were still able to detect @entity4 in their blood , but six to nine months later , all traces of the virus were gone			1
some patients make it up to eight weeks before the virus returns , but the virus returns eight to 10 weeks after therapy is stopped in the vast majority of patients , @entity14 said in july			1
not so for these two men , however			0
@entity4 discovery ' will change your life forever ' the two men were compared with @entity109 , also known as the " @entity110			2
" @entity109 is thought to be the first person ever " cured " of hiv / aids			0
in 2007 , @entity109 had a stem cell transplant to treat his leukemia			0
his doctor searched for a donor with a rare genetic mutation called @entity118 that makes stem cells naturally resistant to hiv infection			0
today , the virus is still undetectable in @entity109 's blood , and he is still considered to be " functionally cured			1
" a functional cure means the virus is controlled and will not be transmitted to others			0
the stem cell transplant procedure , however , is very dangerous because a patient 's immune system has to be wiped out in order to accept the transplant			0
using a stem cell transplant to treat @entity4 is not for most patients , and only 1 % of @entity134 -- mostly @entity136 @entity135 -- and no african - americans or @entity138 have the @entity118 delta32 mutation , researchers say			1
the transplant is still not a practical strategy for the majority of @entity4 patients , and the risk of mortality is up to 20 % , @entity14 says			1
dr. @entity146 , director of the @entity147 at the @entity148 , agreed			0
" this is not a practical approach for someone who does not need a stem cell transplant since the transplant and its preparation and its subsequent need for chronic immunosuppression is a risky procedure , " @entity146 said			0
" if you have an underlying neoplasm ( tumor ) like these patients had , then the risk outweighs the benefit , " he said			0
" however , if you are doing well on @entity166 and you merely want to get off antiretroviral therapy , then the risk seems greater than the benefit			0
" @entity4 ' cure ' in toddler offers ' global hope ' even though the two patients showed a reduction of the virus in the blood , it could still be in some tissue -- the brain or gastrointestinal tract , for instance , @entity14 said			1
earlier this year , researchers said an hiv - positive baby in @entity182 was given high doses of three antiretroviral drugs within 30 hours of her birth , with doctors hoping that would control the virus			2
two years later , there is no sign of @entity4 in the child 's blood , making her the first child to be " functionally cured " of @entity4			1
the @entity196 , or @entity197 , helped fund the study			0
" these findings clearly provide important new information that might well alter the current thinking about @entity4 and gene therapy , " said @entity197 ceo @entity199			2
" while stem cell transplantation is not a viable option for people with @entity4 on a broad scale because of its costs and complexity , these new cases could lead us to new approaches to treating , and ultimately even eradicating , @entity4			2
" " dr. @entity14 is charting new territory in hiv eradication research , " said dr. @entity213 , @entity197 vice president and director of research			0
" whatever the outcome , we will have learned more about what it will take to cure @entity4			2
we believe @entity197 's continued investments in @entity4 cure - based research are beginning to show real results and will ultimately lead us to a cure in our lifetime			2
" opinion : an aids - free generation is within sight @entity229 contributed to this report .			0
