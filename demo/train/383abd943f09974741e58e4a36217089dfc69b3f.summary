@entity2 appears to be ready to carry out a nuclear test whenever leaders of the reclusive state give the green light , a spokesman for the @entity1 said thursday			1
the comment follows an analysis of recent commercial satellite images by the defense publication @entity11 , which suggested activity was being ramped up at @entity2 's nuclear test site			1
mining carts and excavation equipment at the tunneling area of the @entity2 's @entity17 can be seen in satellite images taken by @entity19 and @entity20 in the past month			1
@entity21 and debris are being removed from the tunnel in the largest quantities seen so far , according to the @entity26 assessment			0
" based on the sand piles from the commercial satellites , we are assuming that they have put necessary devices for a nuclear test inside the shaft , " @entity27 , spokesperson for @entity29 's defense ministry said in a regular briefing thursday			1
" this means they can conduct a nuclear test any time			2
" he said @entity2 was " awaiting a political decision " on whether or not to go ahead with the test , the prospect of which has strained relations between @entity47 and other countries			1
many analysts assume an atomic test by @entity2 is just a matter of time following the failure of a controversial rocket launch last month			2
two previous rocket launches in 2006 and 2009 were followed weeks or months later by nuclear tests			0
a satellite image from mid-april cited by @entity26 shows a full mining train , including an engine and several carts , outside of the tunnel at the nuclear site			1
and a more recent shot on may 9 reveals new road networks at the site along with carts and a vehicle at the facility			0
opinion : a nuclear clash could starve the world @entity2 said tuesday that it would press on with its nuclear program as a response to what it described as hostility from the @entity76			1
the top @entity76 envoy for @entity2 , @entity78 , had warned @entity47 on monday that a possible third nuclear test would be " a serious miscalculation and mistake			1
" an unidentified @entity83 official suggested that a nuclear test had not originally been part of the regime 's plans			2
" we did not envisage such a military measure as a nuclear test as we planned to launch a scientific and technical satellite for peaceful purposes , " he said in a report tuesday by the state - run @entity89			2
but the statement concluded with a vague threat : " if the @entity76 persists in its moves to ratchet up sanctions and pressure upon us despite our peace - loving efforts , we will be left with no option but to take counter-measures for self - defense			0
" @entity2 launched a rocket on april 13 , which failed less than two minutes into the flight			0
it said the launch was to put a satellite into orbit , but much of the international community saw it as a cover up for testing its ballistic missile technology			0
the move torpedoed a deal reached in february under which @entity47 agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for food aid shipments from the @entity76			2
the rocket launch in april was timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of @entity120 , the founder and longtime leader of @entity2			0
it also came a few months after the death in december of @entity124 , who had headed the secretive regime since 1994			0
his son and chosen successor , @entity128 , has taken over as " supreme leader " of the nation , but the level of his influence on policy decisions remains unclear .			0
