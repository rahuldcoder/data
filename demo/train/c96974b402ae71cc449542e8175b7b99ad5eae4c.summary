-- @entity3 's @entity2 account and @entity5 social networking profile have drawn heavy public scrutiny , but he left another , more hidden social media trail : a deleted @entity11 account that sources close to him tell @entity0 once belonged to the accused @entity13 bomber			1
the @entity11 account , with the user name " jmaister1 , " no longer exists , and friends of @entity3 's say it was deleted only recently			1
an @entity11 spokesman declined to comment on the account or disclose when the account was deleted			1
@entity0 national security analyst @entity22 says the account could be significant			2
" if i were an investigator right now , obviously the platform he deleted matters the most , " she said			2
traces of the jmaister1 account were still visible this week in @entity29 's web cache and on other archiving sites			1
digital sleuths often use those tools to find glimpses of deleted material			2
when oversharing online can get you arrested " it 's exactly like an archive , " tech entrepreneur and programmer @entity36 explained			0
" so no matter what changes were made to the page today , on the current server , @entity29 has this sort of imprint from a couple of weeks ago			0
" @entity3 's complete account could not be recovered with those tools			1
@entity29 's cache stores the pages it indexes for variable lengths of time : sometimes days , sometimes weeks			0
the digital traces that remain show that @entity3 added a " like " on several photos referring to @entity56 that were posted by other @entity11 users			1
one shows @entity56 warlord @entity59 , a onetime government official who later masterminded terrorist attacks against @entity61			0
@entity59 was killed in 2006			0
another @entity63 image that @entity3 " liked " carries a string of hashtags including # @entity68 # @entity67 @entity66 and # @entity69			2
an academic @entity56 expert whom @entity0 consulted said the images illustrated a familiarity with @entity56 politics and iconography			0
@entity3 's @entity11 account was n't widely known ; @entity0 spoke with several friends of his who said they were unaware of its existence			1
two of his high - school classmates , however , spoke about the account and said he used it to keep in touch with a close - knit group of school friends			1
the two classmates say they are shocked by -- and in some cases skeptical of -- the charges being levied at the friend they knew as " @entity93			0
" as one said , " @entity93 was the last person you 'd expect to do this			1
i 've honestly never heard anybody say anything bad about him			0
" since @entity3 's account was deleted , little of what he wrote and posted remains publicly visible , but @entity102 expects investigators to take a closer look at whatever data they can reconstruct			1
" were there clues embedded in the combination of images that can tell us something about what @entity113 was thinking ? " she asked			2
" some of those pictures are very benign			0
some of them standing alone do n't mean anything			0
" @entity11 makes clear in its terms of service that it will turn its records over to law enforcement officials when it receives a valid subpoena or search warrant			2
" given the volume of real - time content on @entity11 , some information may only be stored for a short period of time , " @entity11 says on its site			1
" we do not retain data for law enforcement purposes unless we receive a valid preservation request			0
" dead @entity13 bomb suspect posted video of jihadist , analysis shows			0

accused bomber had a little - known and now deleted @entity11 account
digital traces still remain of @entity3 's deleted post
investigators are likely to look closely at the @entity11 trail
one of @entity113 's friends says he " was the last person you 'd expect to do this "
