@entity0 , @entity1 celebrates the 90th anniversary of its founding , party officials are pledging to continue the fight against corruption			1
" anyone who is corrupt , no matter who is involved , will be resolutely investigated to the very end , " said @entity9 , deputy secretary of the @entity10 , the party 's anti-corruption body			0
as the @entity4 enters the 21st century , it will " comprehensively tackle corruption from both its roots and symptoms , combining punishment with prevention , " @entity9 added			1
it 's a daunting task			0
despite repeated campaigns to stamp out corruption , it remains rife and is one of the most incendiary sources of public anger			1
" ( @entity30 ) is so entrenched that honest officials are now part of a minority that risks being left behind , " wrote the @entity28 , a @entity1 - language paper			1
" it is a system where corruption is the rule rather than the exception			2
" rampant corruption , officials say , is an unintended consequence of change			1
" we 're in the midst of major socioeconomic transformation , " said @entity9 , the anti-corruption official			2
" we are at a stage where corruption is frequent and prone to happen			2
" " in the centrally planned economy , " retired official @entity47 said , " there was no market and the government officials could not sell or buy much of anything			1
" now , it 's different			0
corruption thrives , he says , in part because opportunities have expanded			2
@entity1 's gdp per capita , adjusted by purchasing power parity , reached $ 7,517 in 2010 , according to the @entity60			0
that 's up from $ 250 in 1980			0
the economic boom and the general rise in prosperity have made bureaucrats increasingly greedy			0
the result is corruption on a scale more pervasive than the founders of the @entity4 could ever have imagined			2
graft and corruption includes nepotism , accepting bribes and kickbacks , lavish spending of public funds , and laundering of profits and public money overseas			1
official abuse extends to all levels of officialdom , in and outside the party			1

@entity107 , a former member of the policy - making @entity111 , is thought to be the most senior @entity4 official to be investigated and punished since a former @entity115 mayor and party chief , @entity116 , was sentenced to 18 years for bribery			1
with most of the populace suffering from rising inflation , complaining of the gap between the rich and the poor and worrying about their economic future , resentment of corruption is high			2
one popular saying in @entity0 puts it bluntly : " if the party executes every official for corruption , it will overdo a little ; but if the party executes every other official for corruption , it can not go wrong			1
" a public opinion survey conducted by @entity135 last year cites corruption as the worst problem tarnishing @entity1 's image			1
in response to the public outcry , the @entity4 is vowing to sniff out corrupt officials			1

of those cases , 5,373 have been referred to the courts for criminal persecution			0
@entity1 premier @entity149 , speaking this week to a group of party members , pledged to give top priority to the anti-corruption drive			0
" each party member and cadre must abide by the law , be cautious and prudent and practice self - discipline			0
" the press , aided by netizens , has been working zealously to expose the corruption cases			0
internet users have set up websites designed to help blow the whistle			0
public relations consultant @entity164 started a website -- www.ibribery.com -- allowing visitors to anonymously post their experiences of bribing officials			1
some netizens exposed officials who demanded cars and villas , police officers who asked for cash incentives to not issue traffic tickets and doctors who wanted money to ensure safe surgical procedures			0
his site drew 200,000 unique visitors in two weeks , but censors have started to block access to his site			0
worried that he was courting trouble , @entity116 closed it down last week , hoping to apply for a license and restart his site			0
meantime , other netizens have set up copycat sites like www.522phone.com and www.wohuixingle.info vowing to out corrupt officials			0
anti-corruption official @entity9 acknowledges the role of the netizens and general public -- with a caveat			1
" we hope the authorities will supervise the internet , " he says			0
" we hope they can guide the netizens , so they will air opinion through legal means , and the information they reveal are accurate and reliable			0
