-- kepler - 22b is the first confirmed planet in the " habitable zone , " the area around a star where a planet could exist with liquid water on its surface , that has been discovered by @entity12 's @entity8 mission			1
the planet 's radius is about 2.4 times that of the @entity15			1
it is located about 600 light years away			0
its orbital period is shorter than that of the @entity15 : a " year " on @entity20 is 290 days instead of 365			2
there were two other planets confirmed this year by other projects in the habitable zone , but their stars are much cooler than our @entity27 , and their orbits are more like that of @entity31 or @entity32 , scientists say			1
kepler - 22b is 15 % closer to its star and we are to the @entity27 but since @entity20 's star is dimmer , lower in temperature and smaller than our @entity27 , researchers ' modeling suggests it is a similar temperature to the @entity15 , said @entity40 , @entity8 principal investigator at @entity12 's @entity41			1
" if the greenhouse warming were similar on this planet and had a surface , its surface temperature would be something like @entity48 , a very pleasant temperature here on @entity15			1
" the warmer a planet , the more evaporation of water there would be , @entity40 said			2
a planet ca n't have a surface temperature that 's very hot without losing all of the surface water			2
the kepler mission reported in february that it had found 54 planet candidates in the habitable zone ; @entity20 is the first of these to be confirmed , and those results will be published in @entity61			1
there are still 48 potential planets from that batch			0
researchers find planets by examining the brightness of stars as a function of time ; brightness drops when a potential planet crosses the star			0
three transits are required for a planet confirmation			0
the period of the transit of kepler 22 - b was 7.4 hours			2
it did not appear to give off its own light , indicating it is a planet and not a star			0
scientists do not yet have a measurement of the mass of kepler 22 - b , which would tell them more about the composition of the planet			1
this summer , when the planet 's star will be high in the sky , ground - based telescopes can attempt to get its mass. opinion : why we need @entity99 successor the planet is even more mysterious because its radius is between that of @entity15 and @entity103 and @entity104 , both of which have radii about four times the size of @entity15 's			1
so we do n't know what a planet in this size range typically looks like			0
" we have no planet like this in our solar system , " he said			0
is life restricted to @entity15 , or could it exist somewhere like kepler 22 - b ? it may be that the characteristics of @entity15 , with its particular position in the solar system , particular magnetic field strength and presence of larger planets like @entity121 make @entity15 very rare in having life ( this is called the " @entity126			1
" ) but it 's also possible that life in the universe is common , and we 're only one example			0
" as soon as we find an independent example of life somewhere else , we 'll know it 's ubiquitous throughout the universe			0
we 're all looking for no. 2 , " said @entity133 of the @entity134			0
the @entity8 mission has now identified a total of 2,326 planet candidates			1
you can read more about the @entity8 discoveries at the mission website .			2

kepler - 22b is the first confirmed planet in the " habitable zone " where liquid water can exist
the planet is more than twice as big as @entity15
scientists are now trying to establish its mass
the @entity8 mission has identified more than 2,000 planet candidates that could hold life
