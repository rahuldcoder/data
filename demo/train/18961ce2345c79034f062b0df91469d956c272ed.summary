images from @entity1 , the photo - sharing app that lets user spruce up their work with a slate of arty and retro filters , no longer show up on @entity7 , a popular place to share them			1
the change , foreshadowed when photos began appearing buggy on @entity7 last week , was confirmed sunday by both @entity7 and @entity1			2
it marks a shift in how the app will be used and signals a new round in the escalating feud between two of the @entity19 's social media titans			0
since @entity21 bought @entity1 in april , it 's been apparent that @entity21 and @entity7 , which rank one - two in popularity among social - networking users , are distancing themselves from each other			1
in the internet age , data and dwell time equal money			0
with @entity21 pushing to grow its mobile revenue ( and modest stock price ) and @entity7 still searching for effective ways to translate its popularity into profit , this rift was perhaps inevitable			2
in july , @entity7 stopped letting @entity1 users find friends via @entity7 they may want to follow on the photo app. ( they did the same for popular blogging site @entity40 after buying rival blogging platform @entity42			1
) in the most recent move , users began noticing that images posted to @entity7 were cropped weirdly			1
by monday , sending an @entity1 photo to @entity7 simply posted a link directing followers to @entity1 's recently beefed - up website			1
the move was first mentioned by @entity1 ceo @entity51 last week at @entity52 , a tech conference in @entity54			2
" we 're working on building an awesome web presence , which we just launched , " @entity51 said			0
" we revamped our web properties , and now we 're able to staff up teams to work on web properties with the @entity21 acquisition			0
" a @entity21 spokeswoman confirmed monday that @entity1 turned off support for " @entity7 cards , " the app that lets third - party images appear on the site			1
in its statement posted sunday , @entity7 also confirmed what happened			0
" @entity1 has disabled photo integration with @entity7			1
as a result , photos are no longer appearing in tweets or user photo galleries , " the statement reads			0
" while tweeting links to @entity1 photos is still possible , you can no longer view the photos on @entity7 , as was previously the case			2
" at @entity52 , @entity51 said the shift was n't payback for @entity7 shutting down its friend - finder function			0
but he also said there are no plans to disable @entity1 images on other sites			0
" this is more of a one - off , " he said			0
underlying all the back - and - forth , of course , is the possibility that hard feelings still exist after @entity7 's reported offer to buy @entity1 was spurned in favor of a reported $ 1 billion deal with @entity96 's web juggernaut			1
by allowing its images to show up on @entity7 , @entity1 gave @entity7 users no incentive to visit its own site or mobile app. the amount of time visitors stay on a website is an important figure for advertisers choosing which sites to patronize			1
keeping @entity1 photos off @entity7 also could encourage users to publish their pictures to @entity21 , which allows them to show up in all their glory			1
meanwhile , there are reports that @entity7 is planning its own photo - filtering app , which could be out by the end of the year			2
such moves and countermoves are to be expected , many in the tech blogosphere were saying monday			0
" the companies obviously realize how important photos are to getting users to share and interact on the web , so it looks like the competition is n't stopping any time soon , " wrote @entity122 for @entity123			0
others were saying this wo n't change the actual @entity7 - @entity1 user experience all that much			1
" breaking : one click to see @entity1 photo now requires two clicks , " wrote @entity134 columnist @entity133 on @entity7			2
" trillions of man click hours lost			0
