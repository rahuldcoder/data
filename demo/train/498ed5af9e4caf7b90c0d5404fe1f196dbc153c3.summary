-- you 're wiped out , eating too much , your chest feels funny when you climb stairs , sex is n't working well , you ca n't wait for a drink and your spouse is looking at you warily			0
but you just bought health insurance online from a health exchange			0
now , before you head for an @entity9 , if only you could find a doctor ... primary care doctors -- the pediatricians , family doctors and internists who constitute the foundation of our medical system -- are also in trouble			1
over quite a few years now , their numbers and accessibility have fallen			0
so it 's important to consider the likely impact on these frontline doctors when the @entity23 , better known as @entity23 , goes into full effect			2
could @entity23 help turn this trend around ? one thing is for sure			2
@entity23 has already accomplished something remarkable : no longer can previous illness or risk for future illness prevent an individual from obtaining health insurance			2
but as the new health exchanges offer affordable insurance to more and more @entity36 , there is risk that a flood of new patients may overwhelm the already - besieged primary care work force			1
the @entity23 incentivizes doctors , including specialists , to join and collaborate in " accountable care organizations " that contract with insurers to take responsibility for a defined population of patients			1
the goals are to contain costs , reward high quality care and help health professionals take care of more patients			1
the idea is also to move away from today 's " fee schedules " that pay doctors and hospitals far more for cardiac catheterizations or surgeries than for treatments with medications that may be just as effective			0
such " perverse incentives " can lead to low quality care and high cost			2
but the devil is in the details , and @entity23 does n't have clear answers to some difficult problems			0
primary care doctors worry about measuring quality of care properly and rewarding different types of practice fairly , especially since the enormous disparities in income among doctors create resentments in the medical community			1
some of the challenges ahead include : how to measure quality techniques for measuring quality are improving , but there 's a long road ahead before doctors agree on their scientific validity , particularly when quality scores may affect their income			1
how do you grade care for patients with hypertension , diabetes or high cholesterol levels ? numbers such as blood pressures , sugar or lipid levels tell only part of the story for individuals whose genes , cultural habits , psyches and social circumstances vary widely			0
researchers are working hard to develop strong and replicable measures to measure quality , but this remains an enormous challenge			1
how to pay for different groups of patients fairly every practice cares for a different mix of the healthy and the sick			0
those who are ill consume more time and resources from doctors			0
unfortunately , we do n't yet have good techniques for adjusting compensation fairly for different mixes of patients			0
payers do n't really know how to compare the work of doctors caring for many sick patients , as opposed to those managing individuals who are generally well			0
income disparity among doctors while doctors overall make far more money than most @entity36 , the @entity23 is unlikely to fix the extraordinary imbalance in incomes between primary care doctors and doctors who are subspecialists , particularly those who perform skilled procedures such as operations or colonoscopies			1
an equally skilled primary care doctor may spend hours helping a patient address the intertwined effects of diabetes , economic hardship and depression , but for that she or he is still paid far less than the surgeon who fixes a hernia or the dermatologist who removes an unsightly mole			2
that certainly does n't raise the likelihood that students who graduate from medical school with enormous debt will choose primary care as a career			2
bureaucratic burdens in part because of ridiculous bureaucratic requirements for paperwork and documentation , primary care doctors have so little time for their patients that they all too often shunt them off unnecessarily to specialists			1
recent data suggest that of all the money paid for outpatient care , 75 % goes to specialists and only 25 % to primary care doctors , a ratio that 's certainly a factor in the high cost of care overall			1
nevertheless , those in primary care , and especially young doctors considering careers in this complex and stimulating field , should take heart			1
@entity23 is supporting exciting new initiatives and pilot programs and spurring innovations that offer opportunities to make primary care more personal , more humane and more rewarding			1
keep an eye out for the following : -- growing benefits from electronic health records that over time will provide the foundation for vital improvements to our health care system , including remote access to records when a patient needs care far from home , and better real - time coordination among everyone involved in a patient 's care			1
-- communication between doctors and patients that is more transparent , bolsters patient safety and leads to improved clinical outcomes by involving patients ( and often their families ) more actively in their own care			2
( my particular obsession is to invite patients to read the notes we write , to share those notes with others and to join us in shaping their care collaboratively )			0
opinion : find out what your doctor really thinks about you -- new technologies and delivery systems that promote care in the home , such as video visits with doctors or nurses , and automated monitoring of glucose levels , heart rhythms or blood pressures , along with many new tools supporting self - care			0
-- watch out for the evolution of " patient - centered medical homes " where teams of primary care doctors , nurse practitioners , physician assistants , mental health professionals , case workers , family caregivers , community - based patient navigators , volunteers and others who bring additional expertise to patient care work together to increase both the quality and efficiency of care			1
the signs are promising for many of these new tools			0
at times , the path toward a better and more equitable health care system may feel slow and treacherous , but we should be hopeful			1
nationally and at my medical school , we 're beginning to see more young health professionals turning toward careers in primary care			2
i think the tide is turning			0
i believe that @entity23 is delivering a child whose tentative steps and inevitable stumbles will be followed by strong strides forward			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity276 .			0

@entity276 : the number of primary care doctors has fallen in the past few years
@entity281 : will @entity23 change trend , especially since there will be more patients ?
he says challenges include how to measure quality of care and compensate doctors fairly
@entity281 : the path to a better health care system may seem hard , but let 's be hopeful
