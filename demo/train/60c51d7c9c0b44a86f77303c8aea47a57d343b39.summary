" @entity4 , " exclaims @entity2 radio shock jock @entity0 in an online video posted earlier this year			1
" which f * * * ing @entity5 used in @entity6 for propaganda ! " @entity0 -- who is famous for his outrageousness on the airwaves and is sometimes compared to @entity12 radio personality @entity11 -- tries hard to stifle a grin that betrays a mischievous mixture of exasperation and comedic bombast			1
" is this a medium we should be proud to use ? " the audience laughs -- but the bonhomie belies a serious point			0
how has radio progressed so little over the last 70 years ? sure , there may now be digital radio and more interaction between programs and their listeners today , @entity0 explains			1
but much of the original formula where a presenter broadcasts to a passive listener interspersed by advertisements remains			0
it was this stasis that eventually pushed @entity0 to earlier this year quit his popular morning show at national station @entity35 and take a leap into the unknown			1
@entity38 he has since founded @entity40 , a web - only " un-radio " venture that aims to merge online broadcasting with social media and instant messaging platforms			1
the idea is to engage directly with listeners ( and attract advertisers ) and the early benefits are many , @entity0 says			1
no longer is he constrained by regulatory guidelines -- meaning he can drop the f - bomb live on air without a rap on the knuckles -- nor does he have to pay for a broadcast license			0
but the real advantage , he explains , is interacting with listeners in a new and exciting environment			2
" @entity58 is definitely where the action is , " @entity0 says			1
" we have phones with us wherever we go			0
" this is increasingly the case in @entity2			2
market intelligence firm , the @entity63 , expects the smartphone market on the continent to double in volume over the next three years and account for close to a third of all handset shipments by 2017			0
@entity2 will remain the largest smartphone market in @entity2 in the near - term with more than a million units being shipped there each month , the @entity63 said last year			1
" anybody who is n't adaptable to the possibilities that mobile represents is going to miss out on a huge business opportunity , " according to @entity0			1
the rise of mobile like most modern media outlets , @entity40 has embraced the likes of @entity82 and @entity83 ( a task made easier by the fact @entity0 has close to a million @entity83 followers ) , integrating them into its service early on			1
all shows are also available via live streaming , podcast and for online download after the event			0
the most intriguing development , however , is what @entity40 is doing on the hugely popular mobile communication app , @entity95			1
thanks to an initial partnership with the @entity99 firm -- who have been looking at ways of publicizing their services in @entity2 -- users have been able to listen to @entity40 shows through the app , as well as being able to directly contact presenters and debate the content of shows with friends and fellow @entity95 users			1
the concept is similar to the way that people may watch something on tv and then use @entity83 to discuss what 's going on via hashtags			0
the major difference with @entity40 's @entity95 platform is that broadcast and discussion all happen within one app. " we 've got 120,000 wechat official account subscribers to @entity40			1
i do n't know if that 's a lot or a few as i do n't really have a frame of reference to compare it to , " @entity0 explains			2
" but what i 'm pleased about is that the level of engagement with those people is extremely high and it 's growing			0
" it 's this engagement that @entity0 explains is proving attractive to advertisers			2
in the future , rather than being subjected to five or six minute advertisements for products that may or may not be relevant -- as currently happens on the radio -- he foresees companies targeting consumers more directly through the app and podcasts			2
this will leave greater time for programming and should prove more fruitful for advertisers			0
" i think that 's a real value proposition to an audience , " @entity0 says			2
" it 's also a very big commercial proposition and it ties radio in most especially in a measurable way			0
" relaying the instant message numerous other media organizations have already tried to square the circle of using popular instant messaging platforms to distribute their content			0
the @entity157 used the @entity95 and @entity159 products when covering the @entity161 elections in early 2014			2
the corporation also adapted the @entity164 app to distribute content during @entity2 's parliamentary elections in may			1
elsewhere , @entity167 have added a @entity159 sharing button on their mobile stories while @entity95 has stated its intention to move into @entity172 and other @entity2 countries where smartphone usage is high by working with local media organisations			1
closer to @entity40 in @entity2 , other web - only stations have popped - up in recent years			1
@entity177 was one of the country 's first online - only outfits and paired up with @entity95 a few months after @entity40 launched			1
according to @entity182 , managing director of industry analysts @entity184 , both ventures have generated a lot of buzz			0
but @entity182 is quick to add that it 's difficult to tell how successful they have been so far because they have " been quite cagey in terms of the data they are sharing with advertisers			0
" @entity0 even admitted earlier this year that releasing a rate card at the wrong time could " kill us			2
" and building the audience is n't the only problem the online upstarts face			0
broadcast radio remains popular , free to listen to and attractive for advertisers , @entity182 adds			0
then there are the potential added data costs for listeners streaming content on their phones			0
for @entity0 , these are challenges , but they are not insurmountable			2
he is clear that he does n't want to replace radio in @entity2 , rather offer something different			2
" what 's different is we are using superior technology to allow people to consume on their own basis what they 'd like , " he said			0
advertisers " really get this			0
the people who really know about these things ( media , digital advertising and branded content ) are as excited about this as we are , " he adds			0
given the popularity of radio and the growth of smart phone devices in @entity2 and across the continent , there will be plenty of observers interested in how @entity0 's " un-radio " project turns out .			1

@entity40 is new mobile ' *unradio* ' station by @entity2 shock jock @entity0
listeners can access show , chat to others through @entity95 app
broadcaster is excited by possibilities , industry experts remain cagey about *prospects*
