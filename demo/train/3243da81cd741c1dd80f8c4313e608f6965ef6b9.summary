@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 striker @entity3 marked his international debut on saturday by missing an open goal in the 0 - 0 draw against @entity8			1
@entity3 made his debut appearance for his national side , but missed a two - yard tap - in			1
despite the easy nature of the chance , @entity3 is by no means the first player to fail to score in such simple circumstances on @entity16 soil ... for this 11 - a - side we have compiled 10 other heart - stopping gaffes to prove to the unfortunate @entity20 that he 's not alone in his misery			1
how many of these other shocking misses do you remember ? 1 ) @entity24 : @entity26 v @entity27 1992 with the score tied at 0 - 0 the @entity29 striker rounded the goalkeeper and , faced with the goal at his mercy , somehow contrived to smack his shot against the crossbar			1
@entity26 went on to lose the match 4 - 2			2
2 ) @entity37 : @entity38 united v @entity39 2003 @entity37 had scored one of the @entity42 's great goals when taking on the whole of the @entity39 defense in their semifinal at @entity46 in 1999			1
however , four years later , the @entity48 winger managed to balloon his shot over the crossbar after a mistake had allowed him a clear run on goal			2
@entity39 went on to win 2 - 0 on their way to lifting the trophy			2
3 ) @entity55 / @entity56 : @entity39 v @entity57 2005 @entity39 were 1 - 0 ahead , courtesy of an earlier @entity55 penalty , when they were handed another opportunity from the spot and instead of simply taking the second penalty , @entity55 attempted to roll the ball to @entity64 team - mate @entity56			1
however , he scuffed the pass and conceded a free - kick in the process , much to the disgust of his opponents who accused @entity55 of lacking respect			2
certainly the oddest penalty the @entity72 has ever seen			0
4 ) @entity74 : @entity75 v @entity76 2004 with @entity75 trailing 2 - 1 , and the clock on 90 minutes , the @entity78 striker managed to lob the ball over the bar from just one yard out -- something his manager @entity83 said at the time was ' almost impossible '			0
5 ) @entity85 : @entity39 v @entity86 2005 @entity87 midfielder @entity85 had already given @entity39 the lead in this @entity42 quarterfinal but , with @entity86 steaming forward for an equalizer , he then astonishingly scooped the ball over the crossbar from two yards out with the goal gaping			0
the miss mattered little as @entity39 went on to beat @entity95 in the final -- and have not won anything since			0
6 ) @entity98 : @entity100 v @entity95 1983 @entity98 will empathize with @entity3 more than most			1
@entity98 is currently the chief executive of the @entity101 , but during his playing career he was responsible for one of the most famous misses in @entity42 final history			0
with the score level at 2 - 2 in injury time , @entity98 was put clean through to give minnows @entity100 the chance to make history			1
the commentator famous screamed : " and @entity98 must score			0
. " he did n't ... and @entity95 won the replay 4 - 0			0
7 ) @entity111 : @entity0 v @entity112 1996 this @entity113 at @entity114 had finished 1 - 1 and each side had scored their first five penalties			0
defender @entity111 , not a regular penalty taker was next in line and his weak effort was hit straight at @entity121 keeper @entity120			0
@entity122 then converted for @entity112 , who went on to win the competition			0
8 ) @entity125 : @entity38 united v @entity126 2006 just to show even the greatest fluff their lines			1
with @entity95 2 - 1 ahead at @entity134 and cruising to the three points , a piece of @entity132 magic on the right wing presented @entity125 with an open goal just three yards out			1
however , the @entity138 wizard casually sliced his shot high over the bar			0
the visitors had the last laugh by winning the @entity72 title , while the @entity144 ended up being relegated in very controversial circumstances			0
9 ) @entity146 : rangers v @entity148 1996 so bad was this miss , that even now a howler in front of goal is known in @entity153 as ' doing a @entity154 '			1
@entity155 were 1 - 0 up at @entity156 when the @entity158 striker , with the goal gaping and the keeper nowhere , contrived to shoot over the bar			1
despite the howler , @entity155 went on to claim their ninth @entity153 title in a row at the end of the season			2
10 ) @entity166 : @entity168 v @entity57 2003 with @entity168 losing 1 - 0 going into injury time , @entity166 is played through , goes around goalkeeper @entity170 but then comically mis - kicks and falls over with the goal at his mercy			2
the defeat left @entity168 in deep relegation trouble although they managed to avoid the drop that season			0
