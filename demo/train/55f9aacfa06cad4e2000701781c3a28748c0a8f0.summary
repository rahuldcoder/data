former @entity1 mayor @entity0 said his office has received death threats since his controversial comments accusing president @entity6 of not loving @entity7			1
" my secretary has received some death threats , " @entity0 said in a brief interview by phone			1
but the former mayor emphasized the majority of the voice mails left at his office were supportive of his remarks			2
@entity0 did not say whether he alerted police to the threatening calls			1
@entity2 can not confirm whether the threats were made			0
as for his initial remarks that ignited the firestorm , spoken at a private dinner for @entity24 's @entity23 gov. @entity22 , a potential 2016 presidential contender , @entity0 offered no apologies			1
" i do n't regret making the statement			0
i believe it , " @entity0 said			2
" i do n't know if he loves @entity7 , " he added			1
" i do n't feel the same enthusiasm from him for @entity7 , " he continued during the interview			1
@entity0 said he did n't mind that his comments became public			1
at the dinner , he said , were well - known members of the news media , including @entity37 anchor @entity36 who , @entity0 said , was the event 's moderator			2
the former mayor said he 's received calls congratulating him for his remarks , including one from @entity42 gov. @entity41			2
a spokesman for the @entity42 governor confirms @entity41 did speak with @entity0 by phone			2
while the spokesman said @entity41 did not endorse everything the former mayor said about @entity6 , he added the governor also has deep concerns about the president 's leadership on @entity52 radicalism			1
" the governor did call him and they did speak , " spokesman @entity53 said			0
" ( @entity41 ) wanted to buck him up because he knows everyone is in a rush to condemn him			0
the governor acknowledges that not everything that the mayor said was good , but he believes that @entity59 is a great leader and that this rush by the left and the media to condemn and marginalize him is ridiculous , " @entity53 said			0
" in short , the governor is not going to throw @entity59 overboard for saying some inadvisable things , " @entity53 continued			0
@entity41 , according to this spokesman , " believes that the president loves this country and that the president has proven to be an inept and incapable commander in chief			2
" @entity53 says @entity41 agrees that " @entity59 asked a very important question which the press has glossed over -- it was this -- ' what 's wrong with this man that he ca n't stand up and say there 's a part of @entity76 that 's sick ? ' " " the governor believes this is question that needs to be answered , " @entity53 said			0
@entity80 , a tycoon in the grocery store industry who sponsored the event , also called to say @entity0 was saying what was on other people 's minds , the former mayor added			2
earlier this week , the former mayor laid into @entity6 's foreign policy as coming from a leader who is somehow disenchanted with the country he leads			2
" i know this is a horrible thing to say , but i do not believe that the president loves @entity7			1
he does n't love you			0
and he does n't love me			0
he was n't brought up the way you were brought up and i was brought up through love of this country , " @entity0 said at the dinner			1
@entity0 's @entity6 critique puts 2016ers in a bind in his latest comments to @entity2 , @entity0 noted he is not running for president in 2016			1
but he tried to explain why he made the comments			0
@entity0 said he was disgusted with @entity6 's response to the executions of @entity107 by @entity108 and the attack on a @entity111 market in @entity112 by radicals inspired by the terrorist group			1
the president erred , @entity0 maintains , in not holding a press conference to immediately denounce those acts of terrorism			1
" @entity76 extremism is not an abstraction , " he continued			0
by contrast , @entity0 pointed out , the president did make comments to the press after the racial unrest in @entity126 , @entity127			2
" there 's something wrong with the rhetoric here , " @entity0 said			0
" i think the president is a very poor leader , " @entity0 added , saying @entity6 does n't measure up to past presidents @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			1
opinion : @entity0 's outburst is ugly , divisive @entity0 said some of his comments were based on @entity6 's autobiography , " @entity141 , " which he said he read during the 2008 campaign at the urging of his wife , who predicted the then - @entity146 senator would be the @entity147 nominee			1
@entity0 said the @entity148 owes him an apology after stating that he had made similar remarks about @entity6 during the 2008 campaign			1
@entity0 said that claim from @entity148 spokesman @entity152 was not true			0
" i think they should apologize to me , " @entity0 said			0
on friday , the @entity148 sharply criticized @entity0 's comments			0
" i can tell you that it 's sad to see when somebody who has attained a certain level of public stature , and even admiration , tarnishes that legacy so thoroughly , " @entity148 press secretary @entity155 told reporters			0
" and the truth is , i do n't take any joy , or vindication , or satisfaction from that			0
i think , really , the only thing that i feel is i feel sorry for @entity0 today , " @entity155 added			0
@entity0 's fall from @entity7 's mayor			1

@entity0 says of president @entity6 : " i do n't know if he loves @entity7 "
@entity0 says his office got death threats over remarks , but most calls were *positive*
