@entity0 -- two men who were found guilty of the racist murder of a black teenager in @entity0 were sentenced wednesday to more than 14 years in prison each , the court said			1
@entity7 and @entity7 were convicted tuesday in the killing of @entity7 in 1993 , after a trial based on new forensic evidence			2
the judge said at the sentencing that the crime was committed for no reason other than racial hatred , @entity12 media reported			0
@entity7 was sentenced to serve at least 15 years and two months in prison , while @entity7 got a minimum of 14 years and three months , the court said			1
@entity7 will be given credit for just over a year that he has already served on remand			2
both technically were given indefinite sentences -- ordered to serve " at her majesty 's pleasure			0
" @entity7 's father shouted " shame on you all , " to the packed courtroom as the sentence was read out , @entity12 media reported			1
@entity12 law required @entity7 and @entity7 to be sentenced as if they were minors because they were teens when they killed @entity7			2
the conviction was the culmination of a case that has gripped the @entity12 media for almost two decades and resulted in a government inquiry in 1999 that was heavily critical of the police for their handling of the case			2
changes brought about as a result of the @entity7 in 1999 -- which labeled the @entity44 " institutionally racist " and said its investigation of the murder was fundamentally flawed -- continue to impact how the police and legal system operate today			1
speaking outside court , @entity7 's mother , @entity49 , expressed her gratitude to those who had supported the family through their long fight for justice			1
it was a " difficult day , " she said , but the judge had recognized the stress and suffering the family had gone through and handed down the longest sentences he could under the law			2
the judge also recognized the men for what they had done , she said , " and there 's no hiding behind their ages			1
" @entity7 was 17 and @entity7 16 at the time of the murder			2
@entity7 's father , @entity71 , told reporters he hoped to be standing outside the court in a year 's time marking the sentencing of the other men allegedly involved in his son 's death			1
other youths who were with @entity7 and @entity7 on the night of the murder have long also been suspects in the case			1
however , extensive re-examination of material gathered at the time has not yet produced evidence for a prosecution			0
metropolitan police commissioner @entity88 told the @entity89 wednesday that " the other people involved in the murder of @entity7 should not rest easily in their beds			2
" @entity93 , deputy chair of the @entity94 -- a body set up as a result of that government inquiry -- paid tribute to the efforts of the @entity7 family			1
" there can be no doubt that in their struggle they were also instrumental in bringing much - needed fundamental reform to policing in this country , " she said in a statement			1
" it is important to acknowledge the changes that have been made over the past decade , but there is equally no doubt that much remains to be done to increase the confidence of black and minority ethnic communities in policing			0
" while the initial murder inquiry had been " truly shocking in its negligence , " she added , the current investigation team deserved credit for its work on the case			0
speaking outside court tuesday , @entity49 told reporters that she felt " relief that these racist men no longer feel they can murder a black man and get away with it			0
" but , she said , the court 's decision was not a cause for celebration			0
" these verdicts will not bring my son back , " she said			0
" how can i celebrate when my son lies buried , when i ca n't see him or speak to him ? " she had harsh words for the police involved in the original investigation , saying they had put her family through huge pain and uncertainty through their failure to investigate properly			2
" this result shows that the police can do their job properly -- but only if they want to , " she said			0
" i only hope that they have learned their lesson and do n't put any other family through what we 've been put through			0
" @entity7 , who was 18 when he was stabbed to death in southeast @entity0 in an unprovoked attack , was a good student who had applied to study architecture at university			0
@entity7 was a son any mother would have been proud of , @entity49 said , and she missed him with a " passion			1
" the @entity7 concluded that " @entity7 's murder was simply and solely and unequivocally motivated by racism			1
" during the six - week trial , jurors were told of significant new forensic evidence recovered from clothing seized from the suspects ' homes 18 years ago , including a very small blood stain on the collar of a jacket taken from @entity7 's closet			1
dna testing indicated the blood was that of @entity7			0
evidence was also found linking @entity7 to @entity7 's death			1
the new forensic evidence was the result of " previously unavailable scientific technology and techniques , " said @entity176 , acting deputy commissioner for the @entity44			0
the defense claimed that the incriminating evidence was the result of cross-contamination after the clothing was seized by police			0
@entity7 had previously appeared in court in 1996 in connection with the @entity7 murder , but that case -- a private prosecution brought by the @entity7 family -- collapsed and he was acquitted			1
his latest trial on the same charge was allowed thanks to a change in the centuries - old " double jeopardy " law under which a person who had been acquitted could not be tried again for the same offense			0
in a change that came into effect in 2005 in @entity200 and @entity201 , a second trial is allowed if substantial new evidence emerges			0
the head of the @entity204 , set up by the teenager 's parents to help young people who want to study architecture , said tuesday he welcomed the verdict " with a sense of huge relief			0
" " throughout the 18 - year ordeal , the @entity7 family 's desire has been the pursuit of justice -- today , justice was served , " chief executive @entity212 said in a written statement .			1
