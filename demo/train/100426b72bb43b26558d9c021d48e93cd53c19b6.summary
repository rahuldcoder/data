@entity0 -- for @entity3 , it was a day of vindication over a decade in the making			1
president @entity6 stands with @entity3 shortly before he signed the bill bearing her name thursday			1
more than 10 years after first filing a gender discrimination claim with the @entity10 , the beaming retired grandmother from @entity12 stood in the @entity13 of the @entity14 , watching the president of the @entity16 sign a landmark piece of pay - equity legislation bearing her name			1
" i can not begin to describe how honored and humbled i feel today , " @entity3 said thursday			2
" when i filed my claim ... never , never did i imagine the path that it would lead me down			0
" under the @entity23 , victims of pay - based discrimination will now have the right to file a complaint to the government within 180 days of their most recent paycheck , as opposed to within 180 days of their first unfair paycheck			1
the law 's supporters argue the change was necessary because , under the old standard , an employer merely needed to hide unfair pay practices for a few months before being able to continue them , without penalty , forever			1
@entity3 's contribution to the long struggle for women 's rights and equal pay did not come easily			1
it took three presidential campaigns , years of arguing and persuasion in the halls of @entity46 , and seemingly endless rounds of litigation			0
it also took the help of a stranger			0
" i did not learn of the pay discrimination until late in my career , " @entity3 , a former employee with @entity52 , said during an interview with @entity1			1
" someone left me an anonymous note in my mailbox at work showing my pay versus three males			0
and we four were doing the exact same job			0
" @entity3 retired after 19 years working for @entity52 in @entity64 , @entity12			2
she filed a complaint with the @entity10 in march 1998 , alleging that men in her plant doing similar work were paid 15 to 40 percent more			0
the records backed her up			0
@entity3 proved that she was being paid $ 6,000 less than men doing the same work , including those who were the lowest paid in their job duties			2
ultimately , both the @entity10 and a jury ruled in her favor			0
@entity3 was awarded $ 360,000 in back pay			1
@entity3 's fight , however , was just beginning			1
a federal appeals court later threw out her claim , limiting her lawsuit to discrimination that may have happened in the six months prior to her initial complaint with the @entity10			2
a three - judge panel also dismissed the pay discrimination allegations during that 180 - day window			1
@entity3 's case increasingly gained the attention of politicians and the public as it climbed the legal ladder			1
by the time the @entity93 weighed in with a ruling in 2007 , the case was a political football			0
most @entity96 used it to rail against sexual discrimination ; many @entity100 warned the case could harm employers			0
in a narrowly divided 5 - 4 ruling , the high court sided with @entity52 , concluding that @entity3 had only a federally mandated 180 - day window in which to make her initial claim			1
such a " filing deadline protects employers from the burden of defending claims arising from employment decisions long past , " concluded justice @entity107			0
in strongly worded dissent , justice @entity114 accused her conservative colleagues of being " indifferent " to victims of pay discrimination			2
if women sued only when the pay disparity became steady and large enough to enable them to mount a winnable case , they would be cut off at the court 's threshold for suing too late , @entity114 argued			1
her legal options cut off , @entity3 turned to @entity126			2
democrats pushed for legislation -- bearing @entity3 's name -- to overturn the @entity93 's ruling and change the 180 - day window			1
they made little headway with the @entity134			0
during the 2008 campaign , the @entity135 proved to be a significant point of contention between then - sen. @entity6 and @entity100 nominee sen. @entity139			1
@entity6 emphasized what he called the plan 's benefits to working women , while @entity139 criticized it as a boon for trial lawyers			2
when @entity6 won the presidency , congressional @entity96 put a reversal of the high court 's ruling near the top of their agenda			2
on thursday , that piece of the agenda was completed			0
the @entity135 was the first bill signed into law by @entity6			1
" it is fitting that with the very first bill i sign ... we are upholding one of this nation 's first principles : that we are all created equal and each deserve a chance to pursue our own version of happiness , " @entity6 said at the bill 's signing ceremony			1
" if we stay focused , as @entity3 did -- and keep standing for what 's right , as @entity170 did -- we will close that pay gap and ensure that our daughters have the same rights , the same chances , and the same freedom to pursue their dreams as our sons			1
" first lady @entity178 also made clear her support of the new law and @entity3 personally			2
" anyone who meets @entity3 ca n't help but be impressed by her commitment , " the first lady said at a reception shortly after her husband signed the bill into law			1
" she knew unfairness when she saw it and was willing to do something about it because it was the right thing to do , plain and simple			0
" for @entity3 , the signing was emotional			2
" to watch ( the president ) sign a bill that bears my name -- the bill that will help women and others fight pay discrimination in the workplace -- is truly overwhelming , " @entity3 said while standing next to the first lady			1
" @entity52 will never have to pay me what it cheated me out of			0
in fact , i will never see a cent from my case			0
but with the president 's signature today , i have an even richer reward			0
i know that my daughter and granddaughters ... will have a better deal			0
that 's what makes this fight worth fighting			0
" with this win , @entity3 concluded to a rousing ovation , " we will make a big difference in the real world			0
