@entity0 , @entity1 -- if you 're a comedy fan , you 've probably heard of him by now			2
comedian @entity6 , 50 , is famous for his clean jokes about everyday life			1
famous for his clean jokes about everyday life , comedian @entity6 is at the peak of his career , gaining new followers with every performance			1
on a recent saturday night , he dazzled a sold - out audience of more than 2,000 people near @entity0 as part of his 2009 comedy tour			1
the easygoing 50 - year - old comedian with a boyish smile and energetic presence pranced back and forth across the stage saturday telling jokes that brought laughter to issues both serious and silly -- from the stressful economy to the quirks of text messaging			1
@entity6 , a @entity28 , @entity29 , native , has been performing stand - up comedy since 1980 by starting at small venues and comedy clubs			1
his breakthrough came in the late 1990s after the release of his album " @entity40 , " which sold 150,000 copies despite the comedian 's relative obscurity at the time			1
the album featured simple routines that made fun of childhood memories such as @entity46 baseball games and seat belts			0
his witty , clean style of humor on the album , which resonated with a wide audience from college kids to grandmothers , catapulted him to success			1
since then , he has gone on to release three dvds			0
@entity55 , a comedy publication , named @entity6 's most recent dvd , " the @entity58 , " one of the top five comedy dvds of 2008			1
nowadays , he routinely appears on television , including specials on @entity62 and slots on the " @entity64			0
" his tour this year will visit more than 80 cities , nearly twice as many as four years ago			0
@entity2 sat down with @entity6 to learn more about his brand of comedy and what 's in store for the future			1
@entity2 : how did you become interested in comedy and stand - up ? @entity6 : this is n't the main reason , but when i was in college [ @entity79 in @entity80 ] , my name was @entity81 for @entity82			1
i had a 7 a.m. class , and i missed it almost every day			0
i would wake up and run across campus			0
i remember thinking , " what 's going to happen if i do n't wake up for things ? " and then a comedian performed at our college , and i went to the show , and i noticed the show started at 8 p.m. and i was like , well , the hours are good			1
i can handle a job that starts at 8 p.m. @entity2 : who are some of your influences ? @entity6 : i love @entity98			1
he took silliness to a level of brilliance , i think			0
@entity2 : how do you get your ideas ? @entity6 : i used to try and sit down with a blank piece of paper			1
i would stare at the paper , and it just continues to stay blank			0
i 've learned that for me , it 's easier for me to go out and live my life and do my thing			1
@entity2 : you do n't really use the crass language many comedians rely on			0
is there a reason for that ? @entity6 : i do n't really know those words [ laughing ]			1
i used to have a few jokes here and there with a four - letter word in it			2
i was always 90 to 95 percent clean with my jokes anyways , and i 'm kind of anal so , why be 95 percent something when you could be 100 percent something ? it worked out , and people really seem to respond to it so i guess that other 5 percent was n't that important anyways			2
@entity2 : do you try to incorporate the economy into your jokes ? @entity6 : i do a few jokes about the economy but from an everyday person perspective			1
people like to laugh , and they especially like to laugh during difficult circumstances			0
one of the best shows in @entity137 i had was the week after 9/11			0
i was surprised this comedy club was even going to have a show			2
they said people were looking for a diversion			0
i went up and said i 'm not trying to make light of what happened , i 'm just trying to forget about it for an hour			0
i find it 's similar to what is happening with the economy			2
obviously , it 's not as serious as 9/11 , but people are looking for an escape			2
i think people want to laugh			0
@entity2 : how can comedy help people through tough times ? @entity6 : i think comedy is a good way to deal with anything			1
i hear about people in the hospital who are ill , and they use humor to help them through it			2
i think it 's a great remedy for many things			2
they say a formula for comedy is comedy equals tragedy plus time			2
a difficult or uncomfortable situation takes place , and then you laugh about it later down the road			0
sometimes i wonder if i could be so mentally healthy to subtract the time part			0
like what if there is a flat tire , and it 's raining outside ? instead of laughing a month later , why not laugh while you are changing tires in the rain ? @entity2 : your fan base has really grown in the last five years			2
how does the fame feel ? @entity6 : it 's been a slow gradual thing for me			1
i 've never had a single event or television show that did it			0
i just pick up a couple more fans and a few more fans , and before you know it , it 's like hey man , things are going ok			0
@entity2 : what 's in store for the future ? @entity6 : this is what i like doing , and i will hopefully do it forever			1
if something else comes along , i 'd be open to that			0
@entity2 : what about a television show ? @entity6 : i 'm not really interested in being an actor			1
but i would like to get on a television show that would capture my comedy and in that role do a little acting			0
i 'd like to do something that has to do with my comedy .			0
