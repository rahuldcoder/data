horror movie " @entity6 , " which the studio acquired for just under $ 1 million , earned a tremendous $ 34.5 million in its first three days , becoming the first breakout box office star since " @entity9			1
" in fact , the strong debut marks the third - best january opening of all time behind " cloverfield " ( $ 40.1 million ) and a re-release of " @entity15 " ( $ 35.9 million )			1
is this a sign of things to come in 2012 ? perhaps			0
but it 's more likely a sign of the recent popularity of possession movies			0
demonic tales have made a mini-comeback in the last few years -- starting with the success of 2005 ′ s " @entity25 , " which earned $ 75.1 million domestically			1
since then , similar titles like 2009 ′ s " @entity29 " ( $ 55.4 million ) , 2010 ′ s " @entity30 " ( $ 41 million ) , and 2011 ′ s " insidious " ( $ 54 million ) have all proven lucrative thanks to their tiny budgets			2
" @entity32 , " for example , cost just $ 1.5 million to make			2
of course , the " @entity34 " movies ( the fourth of which was just announced this week ) are the biggest success stories of this whole trend			0
a total of $ 8 million has been spent making the three " found footage " movies , yet they have earned $ 296.7 million domestically			1
@entity4 marketed " @entity6 " in much the same way the studio markets the " @entity44 " films			2
commercials included ample shots of audiences screaming at the screen , and viewers were encouraged to use social media to chat up the film with the " @entity53 " campaign			0
indeed , all the promotional costs -- certainly a much higher number than the budget -- helped " @entity6 " achieve a stellar debut , but where does it go from here ? well , it falls			2
due to their overwhelmingly young audiences , who love to rush out to the theater on opening weekend , horror movies almost always open big and fall precipitously at the box office , but " @entity6 , " with its utterly terrible " f " cinemascore grade ( some issue has been raised as to whether the grade is actually an " f " or closer to the " c " range ) , will likely plummet even more quickly			1
not that it really matters , though -- the horror pic is already in the black , and it may finish with as much as $ 70 million			2
in second place , " mission : impossible - @entity79 , " another @entity4 film , continued its comeback performance with $ 20.5 million in its fourth weekend			1
the action blockbuster , which became the biggest hit of the holidays , has now earned $ 170.2 million , and it should finish well above $ 200 million			1
" @entity83 : a game of shadows " held onto third place with a $ 14.1 million weekend			1
the sequel , which initially appeared a major disappointment when compared to the original " @entity83 , " has redeemed itself handily in the last few weeks			2
after two weekends , " shadows " was trailing " @entity83 " by $ 59.7 million , but over the past two weeks , the sequel has narrowed that gap to $ 22.7 million , and it now has a running total of $ 157.4 million -- still disappointing , but not nearly the disaster it first appeared			1
" @entity100 " finished the frame in fourth place with $ 11.3 million , dipping only 24 percent , the smallest drop in the @entity99			1
could the edgy adaptation finally be finding its adult audience now that the warm n ' fuzzy holiday season is over ? after 19 days , " @entity100 " has grossed $ 76.8 million , and if it maintains strong holds like this , it should pass $ 100 million			1
" @entity105 : @entity107 " rounds out the @entity106			0
the kiddie threequel , which has majorly underperformed compared to expectations , dropped 42 percent to $ 9.5 million			0
it has now grossed $ 111.6 million total			0
the next three spots were filled by holiday releases that never totally found their footing			0
two of them , " @entity118 " and " @entity119 , " are performing respectably , though			0
the films earned $ 8.6 and $ 8.5 million , respectively , this weekend , and they have nearly identical totals of $ 56.8 million and $ 56.6 million			1
still , there seems to be a common understanding in the blogosphere that " @entity118 " ( which cost $ 66 million ) is performing admirably , while " @entity119 " ( which cost $ 50 million ) kind of fizzled , to which i say : huh ? ! in eighth place is a movie which has actually fizzled -- at least domestically			1
" @entity133 , " @entity131 's expensive motion - capture animation , dropped 42 percent this weekend to $ 6.6 million and $ 61.9 million total			1
in ninth place , @entity137 ' " @entity136 , " which expanded into 809 theaters this weekend , performed admirably in its wider release			0
the well - reviewed spy drama maintained a robust $ 7,129 per theater average , giving the film a $ 5.8 million weekend and an early $ 10.4 million total after five weekends			1
" @entity145 " held onto a spot in the @entity99 for one final weekend			0
the ensemble romantic comedy fell 48 percent to $ 3.3 million			0
the film has earned $ 52 million ( less than half the gross of @entity149 ) , and it likely wo n't make it much further			2
@entity6 - $ 34.5 million 2			1
mission : impossible -- ghost protocol - $ 20.5 million 3			1
@entity83 : a game of shadows - $ 14 million 4			1
the @entity100 - $ 11.3 million 5			2
@entity105 : @entity107 -- $ 9.5 million 6			0
@entity118 - $ 8.6 million 7			2
we bought a zoo -- $ 8.5 million 8			0
