@entity0 , @entity1 -- the moral conscience of @entity5 's reform movement passed away sunday morning			1
grand ayatollah @entity6 , who died at 87 , was the @entity5 equivalent of @entity9 's @entity8 for politics			1
over the past 20 years , he distinguished himself by virtue of his persistent , judicious criticism of human rights abuses in the @entity14 and his defense of the democratic aspirations of the people of @entity5 within the framework of an ethical interpretation of @entity20			1
his death comes as a huge blow to the @entity23 , yet his supporters will take comfort that he lived a full life and intervened on all the major political questions plaguing @entity5 and @entity29 politics			2
born into a poor family in 1922 in the small town of @entity32 , @entity6 rose through the ranks of the religious seminaries to the position of a grand ayatollah ( the most senior clerical position in @entity20 ) primarily because of his exceptional erudition and broad following as a source of religious authority			0
during the oppressive political climate that enveloped @entity5 after the 1953 coup d'Ã©tat , @entity6 emerged as a leading clerical leader , who allied himself with @entity45 to protest the dictatorship of the shah and @entity5 's close alliance with the @entity49 and @entity50			1
he was frequently imprisoned and tortured -- acts that increased his prestige and credibility as an opposition leader who was willing to speak truth to power			0
he was one of the key intellectual theoreticians of the concept of the " rule of the @entity29 jurist " ( velayat - e faqih ) , which formed the foundation of @entity5 's post-revolutionary constitutional order , thus ensuring clerical domination of @entity5 politics			1
it was a position he would regret later in his life			0
buttressed by his impeccable religious , revolutionary and political credentials , @entity6 emerged as one of the leaders of @entity5 's @entity71			1
he was soon designated as the official successor to @entity45 , a position he held until 1989			0
during this period of increasing internal repression and a wave of political executions , @entity6 began his uncompromising criticism of the @entity14			2
as a result , he was removed from his position as @entity45 's heir apparent			0
all formal ties with the ruling regime were severed			0
@entity6 retired to his home in the religious city of @entity86 to resume his teaching and study and to reflect upon the relationship between religion , ethics and politics			0
in this period , @entity6 's religious and political thought underwent a reorientation			2
human rights and democracy moved to the center of his religious teaching			0
on many of @entity5 's most sensitive and politically charged debates , @entity6 intervened in an unprecedented manner that marked a clear contrast with the ruling ideology of @entity5 regime			1
on the question of @entity5 's persecuted @entity108 minority , he called for the granting of full citizenship rights and rejected longstanding views on the punishment for apostasy in @entity20			1
in terms of @entity5 's international relations , he apologized for the seizure of the @entity49 embassy in 1979 and called for the establishment of relations with the @entity49 based on mutual respect			1
he even issued a fatwa on nuclear weapons , encouraging muslims to " take the lead in banning legally and practically all such weapons for all countries and in soliciting the help of respectable and dependable international organizations in guaranteeing such a ban			0
" in november 1997 , a few months after @entity131 's presidential victory , @entity6 delivered a harshly worded sermon on the birthday of the first @entity134			2
in this famous speech , which circulated widely and clandestinely in @entity5 and abroad via audiotape , he criticized the growing authoritarianism of the ruling clerics and encouraged @entity5 's new reformist president to use his popular mandate to press forward with democratizing the political system			1
he also directly criticized and questioned the legitimacy of @entity5 's supreme leader @entity143			1
retribution was swift : his office and home were attacked by pro-regime thugs and the cleric was placed under house arrest for the next five years			0
yet he continued to write and issue bold statements of support to @entity5 's reform movement , essentially using his religious authority to give moral sanction to democratic forces in @entity5 society			1
in the aftermath of @entity5 's discredited 2009 presidential elections , @entity6 was one of the most outspoken critics of @entity160 and @entity143			1
in the final six months of his life , on a near - weekly basis , @entity6 issued a strong statement of support for the @entity23 and strongly condemned human rights abuses			2
" a regime that uses clubs , oppression , aggression , " he warned , " against [ the people 's ] rights , injustice , rigged elections , murder , arrests , and medieval or @entity177 - era torture , [ a regime that ] gags and censors the press , obstructs the media , imprisons intellectuals and elected leaders on false allegations or forced confessions ... -- [ such a regime ] is despicable and has no religious merit			0
" in a widely reported fatwa on july 11 , he called @entity5 's rulers " usurpers and transgressors " who have lost all legitimacy to rule			2
this was a historic statement as it explicitly affirmed that all believing @entity123 have a moral obligation to oppose the current rulers in @entity5 and to seek their replacement , albeit through nonviolent means			0
" people must express their opinion about the illegitimacy [ of @entity5 's current rulers ] and the lack of their approval of their performance , and seek their dismissal through the best and least harmful way , " he affirmed			2
" it is clear that this [ dismissal of the officials ] is a societal duty of everyone , and all the people , regardless of their social positions and according to their knowledge and capability , must participate in this endeavor , and can not shirk their responsibility			0
" @entity6 was feared by @entity5 's ruling establishment precisely because he undermined their legitimacy			1
he will join the pantheon of @entity5 leaders before him who similarly struggled against dictatorship			0
arguably , his most important legacy bequeathed to @entity5 and @entity29 politics is that when given a choice , one must always follow the dictates of one 's conscience over the temptations of political power			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			0
