" @entity3 , " one of the most beloved movies of all time , celebrates the 75th anniversary of its release this month			1
here are some things you may not have known about the film : 1			1
that makeup was killer makeup in 1939 , especially the elaborate and colorful cosmetics many members of the cast wore , was n't as safe as the stuff performers wear today			1
in fact , some of it was downright deadly			1
@entity18 , who was originally cast as the @entity19 , had to leave the film when his lungs became infected by aluminum dust			1
the makeup was adjusted for @entity24 , but he still remembered it as " awful			1
" @entity26 's copper - based makeup as the @entity27 was poisonous , so she lived on a liquid diet during the film , and the makeup was carefully cleaned off her each day			1
@entity31 's @entity30 costume was so heavy -- " like carrying a mattress around , " said his makeup man -- that he 'd emerged drenched at the end of shooting			2
even @entity38 's @entity37 face left permanent marks			2
poor @entity26 the actress has frightened generations of " @entity44 " fans with her portrayal of the @entity27 , but the makeup she wore was n't the only indignity			1
she was burned in one scene			2
also , though she played an old crone , she was just 36 at the time			2
a @entity51 coincidence when the wardrobe department was fishing around for a jacket for professor @entity56 ( @entity58 ) , some @entity53 staffers bought a bunch at a second - hand store			2
one of them fit @entity58 perfectly			2
when he checked the label , it said " @entity65 @entity64 " -- the author of the " @entity44 " books			0
yeah , it 's classified as " legend " by @entity69 , but it still makes for a great story			0
you 're a rich dog , too @entity72 , actually named @entity73 , was paid $ 125 a week for her services			0
( yes , @entity72 was a female			0
) @entity77 got $ 500 a week for a lot more work , and no doubt many of the extras got much less than the dog			0
( according to @entity83 , who played a @entity82 , the @entity82 got $ 50 a week			0
changing colors the lights required for @entity86 were so bright that @entity88 's dress , which appears blue and white , was actually blue and pink			0
also , the slippers -- silver in @entity64 's book -- were made red to show off the process			0
incidentally , the five known pairs from the film are each worth $ 1.5 million today			1
@entity95 ! @entity95 ! " @entity3 " was hugely successful in its initial run and nominated for six @entity95 ( though one of them , for color cinematography , is considered " unofficial " on the @entity102 's database )			1
it won two , one for its score , one for " @entity106 " -- which was almost cut from the film			1
director @entity109 came out well , too			0
though not nominated for " @entity44 , " he won for directing the year 's best picture winner , " @entity112			1
' dark side ' of the rainbow at some point in the ' 90s , word went around that @entity119 's 1973 album " @entity120 " synced up with the movie in eerie ways			0
though members of @entity119 swear it 's pure coincidence -- and psychologists will tell you that we see links where we want to -- some of the matchups are striking : " @entity136 " meshes well with the tornado ; the old @entity133 1 of the album ends just as the sepia - colored portion of the movie does ; and the heartbeat at the album 's close coincides with @entity88 listening to the @entity19 's torso			0
even if it 's bull , it still makes for entertaining watching .			0
