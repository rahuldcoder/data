@entity0 -- a morning thunderstorm has left the waste ground outside @entity0 's compound for migrants and refugees slick with orange mud			1
hanging around under overcast skies , a knot of men -- unshaven and dressed in a motley collection of t - shirts -- watch a convoy of @entity15 military vehicles rumble by			1
they have reached this tiny @entity15 enclave in @entity19 overland -- from @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and elsewhere			1
some just want a better life in @entity24 ; others are fleeing war			1
some have clambered over the three 20 - foot ( 6 - meter ) fences topped with razor - wire ; others have bought forged @entity32 passports to take advantage of @entity32 ' eligibility to enter @entity0 as day - laborers or to trade			1
but the @entity15 authorities fear that among this tide of the helpless may be some intent on bringing jihad to @entity24 , using the same routes used by people - smugglers across @entity19			1
the heavy police presence in @entity0 -- the military helicopters , armored vehicles and patrol boats -- are part of their response			1
so are regular police raids on the poor , crowded neighborhood of @entity53 , which sits on a hill overlooking the city center , with its elegant art - deco and modernist buildings , its elegant central park along the @entity59 and sweep of sandy beaches			2
' not welcome " foreigners , and especially journalists , are not welcome in @entity53 , where at least one wall bears graffiti in support of the @entity67 in @entity68 and @entity21 ( @entity69 ) and others urge reclaiming everywhere from @entity71 to @entity68 as @entity73 states			2
the imam of a mosque in @entity53 is not available to talk			2
we are variously told he is sick or fasting , and are warned not to film in @entity53 's precipitous alleys			2
the tension is greater than usual following a joint operation by @entity15 and @entity32 security agencies last week			1
eight men were arrested in the neighboring @entity32 town of @entity84			2
the alleged ringleader of a cell said to have been recruiting would - be jihadists for @entity68 and @entity21 was detained in @entity53			2
@entity88 was arrested at his home , within a few hundred yards of the fence that separates @entity0 from @entity32			1
the operation to arrest @entity92 was not without incident			2
a crowd gathered and threw stones at police in riot gear			2
at one point , witnesses said , police fired in the air as they tried to extricate @entity88			2
everything you need to know about @entity69 @entity15 police would also like to arrest his brother , @entity105 , a former @entity15 soldier trained in using explosives			1
after leaving the army in 2010 , @entity105 headed south to @entity20 , where he joined the jihadist group @entity109 , an offshoot of @entity111			2
in early 2012 , @entity109 and other groups occupied nearly half of @entity20 , before @entity115 intervention drove them back into pockets of the @entity117			2
@entity15 officials believe @entity105 moved onto @entity21 , and from there was in touch with his brother about recruiting young men from @entity32 to join @entity69			1
the @entity32 government estimates some 2,000 @entity32 have gone to fight in @entity68 and @entity21 , just as hundreds joined the insurgency in @entity68 between 2005 and 2009			0
@entity88 was swiftly flown to @entity126 to face a judge , @entity127			0
denying him bail , @entity127 said @entity32 authorities determined that two men from the cell , had gone to an area of @entity21 and @entity68 controlled by @entity69 in july			2
@entity127 also expressed a fear widely held among @entity15 officials , saying in his ruling that " the threat posed by @entity15 or foreigners linked to @entity15 joining @entity69 , or their hypothetical return to our country , is manifestly clear			1
" this year , @entity15 security forces have arrested 44 people - some in @entity0 , some in @entity15 's other @entity19 enclave of @entity145 , some on the mainland			1
according to the police , members of a @entity0 group rounded up in may had dispatched 26 men — 24 @entity32 and two @entity15 citizens — since 2012 to join @entity111 and @entity109			1
the migrants ' center in @entity0 is overcrowded , and according to some subsisting there , increasingly unhygienic			1
designed to accommodate some 400 people , @entity156 holds more than 2,000			0
the @entity126 government 's representative in @entity0 , @entity158			1
told @entity1 tuesday that the conditions at the @entity156 were not ideal , but the care of migrants was adequate			0
" even though there are many more over the capacity , they have had all necessities covered , and they have been able to eat , " he said			0
" i believe that there they are much better than before they arrived in @entity0 , " @entity158 said			1
other illegal migrants live on @entity0 's streets			1
it seems a dead - end to many who have risked their lives to gain a toe - hold in @entity24			1
' humiliated and abandoned ' some of the men loitering outside were from @entity178 , the @entity180 town on the @entity21 - @entity182 border now under an intense assault from @entity69			0
thirty - four - year old @entity184 has been in @entity0 more than a month			1
" the suffering that we 've been living , it 's impossible for another human to comprehend			0
for the last two days it 's been raining and we 've been sleeping under it , " he said			0
" we escaped death and now we 're imprisoned here			0
an entire people is being slaughtered			0
we escaped death and no one will grant us refuge			0
" at once angry and despondent , @entity184 added : " my family are scattered between @entity182 and @entity21			0
some are fighting @entity69 , some have fled , some died			0
" @entity184 said that he and others from @entity178 had first fled to @entity182 but even there felt @entity69 ' presence			0
and so they had embarked on the long journey west			0
a few of the lucky ones had been able to fly to @entity207 and travel overland into @entity32			0
others had crossed one conflict zone after another , through @entity212 , @entity22 and @entity213 in a journey taking months			0
another of the group , @entity217 , said he had been smuggled across the border into @entity32 and then into @entity0			1
he was clearly at his wits ' end			0
" it cost us catastrophic sums			0
some people sold their houses , their furniture to get here			0
and look where we 've ended up ? i wish we 'd stayed in @entity21 to kill and be killed			0
it would be better than the camp here			0
" their situation is full of ironies			0
as @entity184 and others languish in @entity0 , some from the @entity15 territory and the @entity32 towns around it yearn to travel in the opposite direction , to join the war they have fled			1
they may use the same people - traffickers to help them do so			0
and according to @entity32 officials jihadist cells often share in those smuggling revenues			0
@entity184 and the hundreds like him trapped in @entity0 may gaze wistfully at the ferries leaving for the @entity15 mainland while their asylum requests go unanswered or unresolved			1
what @entity15 fears is that others in @entity0 , or planning to come here , see those ships as a passage to bring terror to @entity24 .			1

@entity0 is a tiny @entity15 enclave in @entity19
it is also a *makeshift* haven for a tide of *immigrants* *hoping* to get to @entity24
@entity15 authorities fear that among them may be jihadists aiming for @entity24
