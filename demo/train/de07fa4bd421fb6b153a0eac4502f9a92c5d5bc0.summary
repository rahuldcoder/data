twenty - five percent of 800 tested sunscreens are effective at protecting your skin without the use of potentially harmful ingredients , according to the 2012 @entity5 released wednesday by the @entity6			1
" the results are slightly better than previous years , but it continues to surprise us that we can recommend such few products , " said @entity7 , an @entity6 senior analyst			1
to make the watchdog group 's safe list , sunscreens must be free of oxybenzone , retinyl palmitate ( a type of vitamin a ) , not have @entity19 above 50 and protect against @entity20 and uvb sunrays			1
toxic ingredients ? the @entity6 says 56 % of beach and sport sunscreens contain the chemical oxybenzone			1
the primary function of oxybenzone is to absorb ultraviolet light , but some research shows oxybenzone can be absorbed through the skin			2
the @entity6 and other toxicology experts believe that oxybenzone is linked to hormone disruption and potentially to cell damage that may lead to skin cancer			1
the @entity38 says oxybenzone is safe			1
" @entity42 is one of the few @entity44 - approved ingredients that provides effective broad spectrum protection from uv radiation , and has been approved for use since 1978 , " said dr. @entity40 , president of the academy			1
the @entity44 has approved oxybenzone in sunscreen for use on children older than 6 months			1
" we will continue to push for better options every year			0
we 're trying to fill the gap where the @entity44 has failed , " said @entity7			1
the @entity6 also warns consumers to avoid retinyl palminate			1
government - funded studies have found that this particular type of vitamin a may increase risk of skin cancer when used on sun - exposed skin			0
however , these reports have been in mice and evidence has been inconclusive for humans			0
" consumers get frustrated when there are no alternatives , but the point of this is that you do n't have to be completely disheartened , because there are products on the market that do n't contain these chemicals , " said @entity7			0
the @entity6 report found that fewer sunscreens - about 25 % - contain retinyl palmitate , compared to 33 % in last year 's study			1
the @entity6 says this ingredient does not make sunscreen more effective , and until definitive research is available , consumers should avoid sunscreen products containing retinyl palminate			1
broad spectrum most dermatologists agree with the @entity6 's recommendation that consumers use products labeled broad spectrum			1
broad spectrum means the product protects against both @entity97 rays that cause sunburns and also @entity20 radiation that causes premature skin damage and aging			0
" evidence has shown the best sunscreens are the ones that block @entity97 and @entity20 , " said dr. @entity102 , a clinical assistant professor in the department of dermatology at @entity105 , and not affiliated with the @entity6 report			1
" the majority of these companies that market sunscreen products , they try to make people more aware of the @entity19			2
" last year , the @entity44 announced tighter regulations on how manufacturers label products			2
the changes , aimed to cut down on consumer confusion , require sunscreen labels to identify if they provide broad spectrum coverage on the front label			2
brands also wo n't be able to claim products as sweat - proof or waterproof			0
however , do n't expect to see these changes on store shelves this summer			0
last week the @entity44 announced it is giving manufacturers six additional months from their original deadline to meet the new requirements			1
look for the new labeling in december			0
numbers game the @entity6 said consumers should not purchase sunscreens with @entity19 greater than 50			1
@entity19 ( sun protection factor ) works by absorbing , reflecting or scattering the sun 's rays on the skin			0
" it is very misleading to put high @entity19 numbers on labels because it gives consumers a false sense of security and does n't offer a lot more protection , " @entity7 said			0
while @entity19 may sound like a lot more protection than @entity150 , the higher the number does n't always give a high return			0
studies show that sunscreen with @entity154 can block about 93 % of all incoming uvb rays			2
@entity19 30 blocks 97 %			2
@entity19 50 blocks 98 %			2
" the protective factors plateau from there			0
a product with @entity19 100 + blocks about 99.1 percent of the uvb rays , " @entity102 said			0
" you do n't really need a high number			0
they end up being expensive and do n't offer more protection than @entity164			0
" keep in mind , @entity19 protects only against @entity97 rays			0
bottom line it 's easy to get overwhelmed with the sunscreen options on store shelves			2
here 's a quick guide to find the best products to protect your family from the sun : -- use a sunscreen with a minimum of @entity154 and a maximum of @entity164 ; -- make sure labels list @entity20 and @entity97 ( or broad spectrum protection ) ; -- avoid products containing oxybenzone and retinyl palminate if you 're concerned about potentially toxic chemicals ; -- choose lotions versus spray sunscreens for a more evenly distributed protection			1
remember to apply at least 2 ounces of lotion ( about a shot glass full ) and reapply often			0
the sun breaks down the ingredients in sunscreen that protect your skin			2
experts recommend reapplying every two hours , or after swimming or heavy sweating .			0
