-- perhaps nothing illustrates the ambitions of the well - established @entity4 carriers -- emirates , @entity6 and @entity7 -- and @entity8 so much as the swift expansion of their route networks			1
@entity8 currently flies to about 253 destinations , and plans to add another 60 to its network in the next five years			2

all that 's changing as @entity6 , @entity5 , @entity7 and @entity8 all either introduced direct routes to the @entity40 last year , or else have some in the works for 2014			1
" they 're really starting to shake up the @entity40 market for the first time , " says @entity49 , a spokesperson for the @entity50			0
last year , @entity54 launched a direct flight from @entity56 to @entity57 -- the first time in the airline 's history a flight bypassed the @entity54 hub ( last year , @entity62 and @entity63 unsuccessfully sued the @entity65 government to block the @entity5 route )			1
in the next 15 years , the airline plans to double the number of @entity40 destinations it flies into			0
@entity6 will fly to four @entity40 cities by the end of 2014 , while @entity72 will be up to six			1
the expansion has not gone unnoticed by the @entity40 aviation industry			0
the @entity40 trade group @entity75 and the @entity40 pilot union , @entity77 , have been the most ardent opponents of the @entity4 carriers encroachment into the @entity40 market , often joining @entity62 and @entity80 in lobbying @entity81 for protectionist policies			2
" it is interesting to see how the @entity40 carriers and politicians are starting to respond , " says @entity49			2

the importance of developing these routes is not simply to connect these emerging markets with the @entity134 , but with each other			1
" carriers like @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 can access emerging markets in @entity88 , @entity138 and @entity39 and connect them in a way that is meaningful to travelers , and that @entity43 carriers ca n't hope to copy , " says @entity18			1
