-- our democracies are facing a moment of truth			1
from the rise of extremism in the @entity8 to the political gridlock in the @entity10 , leaders are struggling to respond effectively to new and complex global challenges			1
citizens feel alienated with conventional politics and frustrated by the absence of effective policies that serve societies ' needs			1
that 's why i am convinced that the real issue we face is not simply defining economic solutions , but rethinking our democratic institutions			0
in any healthy democracy , there must be a balance between strong government and an empowered electorate that holds that government to account			2
but our democratic institutions have been captured by special interests			2
policy is driven by powerful lobbies			0
despite the rise of social media , media itself is increasingly concentrated in the hands of the few			0
watch @entity40 's @entity39 the speed and power of financial markets make democratic deliberation near impossible -- and government appears slow and weak in comparison			1
banks have become too big to fail , which actually means too big to be accountable to the public good			0
we 've seen this before			0
as @entity52 once said : " we know now that government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob			0
" the absence of a global governance system allows such interests to consolidate even more power , further constraining our capacity for democratic oversight			0
it 's not only the @entity64 -- the 99 percenters -- who are taking a stand against this growing concentration of global wealth and power			0
last year , inequality was cited as the no. 1 challenge by the @entity72			2
not exactly a radical leftist group			0
@entity39 : @entity74 on rebuilding the republic as we seek to rebuild our fragile economies after the financial crisis , economic measures must therefore be matched with democratic measures that rebalance this inequality and redistribute power to our citizens			2
a case in point is @entity86 , where a drastic austerity program was prescribed in exchange for emergency loans to avoid bankruptcy			1
those who have paid the highest price -- low - and middle - income taxpayers , and young @entity86 who now face almost 60 % unemployment -- are not to blame for the crisis			1
austerity has created a sense of injustice and a lack of opportunity that has fed political extremism in @entity86			1
opposition parties chose to enflame popular opinion rather than work together toward a common reform agenda			0
such political opportunism is toxic			0
in @entity86 , it prolonged the crisis , delayed reforms and cost our country dearly			1
that 's why i called for a referendum on the terms of @entity86 's bailout loans : to give ownership of the process back to the @entity86 people			1
although that referendum did n't happen , pushing the proposal did force wider political consensus in @entity86			1
it led to a coalition government and has given the broader public a stake in their country 's future			0
@entity39 : @entity128 on why democracy matters my personal experience has taught me that hyper - partisan politics can not lead us out of financial woes			1
no single party can push through the deep structural reforms that will make our economies sustainable			0
such efforts require consensus , compromise and a sense of responsibility to future generations			0
while polarization is a deeply problematic fact of democracy , it is also true that democracies have the capacity to guard themselves against the empowerment of extremist minorities			2
indeed , what seem to be the dangers and weaknesses of our democracies can be dealt with only by more democracy : ensuring a public space for participation and informed deliberation			1
that 's why i have faith that democracies can find a way to reconcile differences and pull competing parties together for the public good			0
but first , we must ensure that our democracies are regenerated -- by fighting for institutions that are accountable , transparent and genuinely representative of all our citizens			0
@entity39 : @entity171 on the antidote to apathy the recent crisis gives reason to revisit the origins of democracy			2
in ancient @entity179 , democracy was an innovation to disrupt the concentration of power and maintain equality amongst citizens			2
we , too , need to use innovation to reclaim these principles of democracy			2
online deliberation , citizen juries , crowd - sourcing for political solutions , and referenda are all useful tools inspired by the ancient @entity86 version of direct democracy			1
politics must again become the art of imagining a better world -- and collectively finding the power to do so			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity40 .			1

former @entity86 *pm* : from euro - extremism to @entity10 gridlock , this is a moment of truth for democracy
@entity40 says special - interest groups have too much sway , create inequality
@entity40 : politics , with citizen participation , must again become the art of imagining better world
