the man behind the games chatted with @entity1 about his love of video games and tech at @entity23 in @entity0			2
the following is an edited transcript of that conversation : @entity1 : what 's a favorite memory of playing video games when you were young ? @entity3 : we were poor			1
we could n't afford video games			2
so i would go to my friend @entity60 and @entity62 ' house to play his @entity64 or @entity65 's house to play the @entity66 , @entity67 or @entity68			1
we 'd always go to @entity65 's porch , and he used to have them there			1
we had to pay 15 cents to play one of his games , whether it was @entity76			0
you remember @entity78 and having those graphics ? just think about that			0
wow ! @entity1 : what did you think of the music in those old - school games ? @entity3 : i remember playing @entity85 and @entity86 and thinking , " wow , who designed the audio for that ? " some guy was like , " oh , shucks			1
when @entity86 eats the ghost should it be booo - oomp ! " i wonder what they were thinking when they made the audio			0
@entity1 : did game music influence you at all ? @entity3 : i remember when @entity100 came and then the graphics changed and that was a big leap because you saw @entity102 from different angles			1
i have a track where i sampled that game			1
i have my hip - hop @entity102 underground music			0
that 's when he goes underground ( in the game )			1
@entity1 : did you play games as they got better over the years ? @entity3 : yeah			1
i remember joust and then q * @entity116 , right with the graphics started getting better and then there was @entity119 and @entity120			0
that 's when @entity64 started coming in			1
do you remember @entity124 ? what was that all about ? and then @entity127 came out			0
that 's when i was like it 's all about video games			1
did you save the princess yet ? did you get the fairy ? where 's the fairies at ? wow , that was like the dopest			1
and there was that little pond that you had to go to get some more lives and stuff			0
i mean , that 's my childhood from just video games			1
@entity1 : what are you playing these days ? @entity3 : my favorite game is @entity148			1
i 'm a @entity148 addict			0
i design my own teams			1
people online always go , " i 'm not playing you , you 're a freaking cheater			0
" and i 'm like , " what are you talking about ? you can design your own team too			2
we can just play with our own teams anyways			0
" @entity1 : who 's on your @entity148 team when you design them ? @entity3 : oh , i make names up like @entity163 * * or @entity164			1
i make a little short guy that runs really fast ; change his attributes and whatnot			0
i like big dudes , like 6 - foot - 2 quarterbacks			0
that 's what i like doing			2
so that 's why i play @entity148			2
@entity1 : do you play any other games ? @entity3 : i freaking love @entity176 do n't have me play that because i do n't even do the missions			1
i just like to see what i can do to make the cops come chase me and see if i can run from them			0
but @entity148 's my favorite			2
@entity1 : what was it like working on @entity185 game ? @entity3 : two years ago , i would go up to @entity186 and consulted on @entity187			1
that 's what it was called before they coined it kinect			2
so i 'd go up to @entity186 and put in all the work , when i finally saw the video game , i 'm like , " wow , that 's what i was consulting on ? " and my group got the benefit off of all that flying back and forth			1
i 'd work with ( @entity36 ) and say , " oh , no , the dancing should n't be like this			0
we should make it so once i sit down the avatar should n't turn into a noodle			0
you got to fix it to like			0
" and they 'd work on that			0
and i 'm like , " ok , cool			0
also , it should have some type of gesture where the beat slows down and then the choreographer dance guy instructor tells you what you 're doing wrong			2
you should have it do that			0
" and they 'd work on that			0
@entity1 : what impact have you seen your game have on fans ? @entity3 : what i 've noticed with @entity226 was it was the @entity228 thing to do , it was the @entity229 's thing to do when families got together			1
i read tweets like , " oh my gosh , i have n't had that much fun with my daughter in years			0
i have n't had that much fun with my wife in years			0
i have n't had that much fun with my brother for years			0
" when families come together and they 're doing this @entity6 experience with songs that they all know , it 's great			2
it 's a great extension of the @entity6			2
and it goes back to all the work i did going back up to @entity186 working on @entity245 , which is now @entity42			1
it 's been a great journey and i 'm proud of the result			2
@entity1 : what 's your favorite piece of technology that you ca n't live without ? @entity3 : really i want to say my phone			1
i like my phone because that 's the thing , but really it 's my laptop			2
i can tweet with my phone and i have all my addresses in it , but now it 's backed up to my computer			2
so if i lose my phone , i lose it			0
it has a code ( password ) on it			0
nobody 's going to get into it			2
i just get a new phone and download			0
it 's really my laptop that i ca n't live without			2
@entity1 : how do you use your laptop creatively today ? @entity3 : i 've been making music on desktops and laptops for a long time now , so to use this @entity33 , which is lighter and offers better performance is great			1
i love djing with it			0
i love creating with it			0
if you imagine what it was like when @entity280 was making music , we used to make music in studios and the music played on the radio			0
now you 're making music on a computer and you listen to it on the computer			0
so just the idea of that is amazing .			0
