-- for the first time in nine years , @entity1 has outright won the first week of the broadcast season among adults 18 - 49			1
@entity6 , for the fourth year in a row , was first among total viewers			1
both networks are claiming victory , which is normal ( though most in the industry believe the network that wins the adult demo has earned the greater glory since advertisers pay more to target younger adults )			0
no matter how you look at it , this is a good week for @entity1			1
the network is up 12 percent from last fall , while others are down			1
as we pointed out a few weeks ago , @entity1 seemed like it might have a better story to tell this fall			2
so far it 's true , mainly due to the strength of adding " @entity30 " to its fall lineup , as well as the strong performance of new drama " revolution			0
" new comedies " @entity31 " and " @entity34 " have been delivering survivable numbers so far , but " @entity35 " and " @entity39 " are struggling ( not the mention the network 's returning thursday lineup )			0
@entity1 's biggest show â € ” as rivals point out â € ” is not an entertainment program , but " @entity45 , " with last week 's game up 23 percent , so that does n't hurt either			1
this is the first week of the season			2
there 's 30 - some more to go			0
and we all know @entity50 tends to come from behind and end up on top in the demo , with @entity6 leading in viewers			2
but here 's how the networks stacked up during premiere week ( and for those who missed it , here 's the role @entity60 played ) : adults 18 - 49 @entity1 ... 2.9 ... +12 % @entity50 ... 2.6 ... -24 % @entity6 ... 2.4 ... -27 % @entity61 ... 2.2 ... -21 % total viewers @entity6 ... 10.7 million ... -15 % @entity61 ... 8.3 million ...			1
