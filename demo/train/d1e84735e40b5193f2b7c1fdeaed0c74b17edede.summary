@entity0 -- a budget deal reached last week to avert a government shutdown won approval thursday from both the @entity5 and @entity6 , sending it to president @entity7 for his signature			1
the measure cuts $ 38.5 billion in spending while funding the government for the rest of the current fiscal year , which ends september 30			1
with its passage , the @entity5 and @entity13 will now focus on what are expected to be more rancorous battles over a budget for fiscal year 2012 and the upcoming need to raise the federal debt limit			1
a final - hour agreement last friday in talks involving @entity7 , senate majority leader @entity22 , @entity23 , and @entity5 speaker @entity24 included the spending cuts demanded by @entity26 as a step toward controlling @entity29 's skyrocketing debt			1
the measure passed the @entity26 - controlled @entity5 on a 260 - 167 vote			1
the bill would not have passed without support from members of both parties , as 59 members of the @entity26 majority opposed it , showing the challenge faced by @entity24 in keeping his conservative @entity41 - infused caucus unified			1
amid politically perilous tax and spending negotiations with the @entity44			0
the @entity5 vote also reflected growing liberal angst and anger over the impending spending reductions			2
only 81 @entity44 backed the measure ; @entity5 minority leader @entity50 , @entity51 , voted no. in the @entity6 , the final vote was 81 - 19			2
under the deal , $ 38.5 billion would be from the budget including funding from a wide range of domestic programs and services such as high - speed rail , emergency first responders and the @entity61			2
as part of the agreement , @entity13 also voted thursday on measures to de-fund @entity65 and @entity7 's health care overhaul			1
as expected , both passed the @entity5 and were defeated in the @entity68 - controlled @entity6			0
one point of concern for conservatives was a report released wednesday by the nonpartisan @entity73 showing that of the $ 38.5 billion in savings , only $ 352 million will actually be realized this fiscal year			1
@entity24 insisted thursday that all of the cuts will take effect eventually , but conceded that the analysis " has caused some confusion " among @entity5 members			0
" there are some who claim that the spending cuts in this bill ... are gimmicks , " he said on the @entity5 floor			0
" i just think it is total nonsense			0
a cut is a cut			0
" freshman rep. @entity90 , @entity91 , told @entity1 that the uproar " certainly does n't help ( @entity24 's ) case and added that he would oppose the bill			2
" i 'm disappointed , " he said			0
" i just think we could have gotten more			0
" regardless , the measure cleared @entity13 one day before the federal government 's current spending authorization expires			1
negotiators narrowly avoided a partial government shutdown last week by agreeing to the deal and passing a short - term spending measure to give @entity13 time to review the agreement			1
in an interview thursday with @entity106 , @entity7 cited areas of agreement with @entity26 in starting a process for reaching a deficit reduction agreement , but he conceded some deep - rooted differences will remain unresolved until after the 2012 elections			1
@entity7 repeated his theme from wednesday 's speech on fiscal policy that @entity29 faces a choice between a budget - slashing @entity26 vision that will change how society functions and a revenue - raising @entity68 vision that maintains the social safety net in place for decades			1
so far , both sides generally agree on seeking deficit cuts of $ 4 trillion over the next 10 - 12 years , @entity7 said , and they have similar thoughts on some areas for fiscal reform and spending reductions			1
at the same time , @entity26 adamantly oppose @entity7 's call for increasing tax revenue by ending @entity131 - era tax cuts for the wealthiest @entity29 and other reforms that would eliminate loopholes			1
in the end , @entity7 said , " some of it will be settled by the @entity29 people in the election , and i think that is how democracy should work			2
" earlier thursday , @entity7 said that " no matter how we may disagree between parties , no matter how much we spend time debating the issues , at some point we 're going to have to come together as @entity29			1
" he spoke uring a meeting with former sen. @entity145 , a @entity146 @entity26 , and former clinton white house chief of staff @entity147 , the co-chairs of @entity7 's deficit reduction commission that issued its report last december			1
as attention turns to larger battles over the fiscal year 2012 budget and raising the nation 's debt ceiling , @entity44 and @entity26 continued expressing widely differing positions designed to appeal to their respective political bases			1
@entity161 chairman @entity160 , @entity162 laid out the @entity26 's vision last week when he unveiled his 2012 fiscal blueprint			1
the congressman 's plan , which he says would cut projected deficits by roughly $ 4.4 trillion over the next decade , calls for significant changes to @entity170 -- two hugely popular entitlement programs			0
under @entity160 's plan , @entity0 would eventually stop directly paying bills for senior citizens enrolled in @entity170			0
instead , recipients would choose a plan from a list of private providers , which the federal government would subsidize			0
@entity180 , which provides health care for the disabled and the poor , would be transformed into a series of block grants to the states			0
@entity26 believe state governments would spend the money more efficiently and would benefit from increased flexibility , while @entity44 warn that such a move would shred the health care security provided to the most vulnerable @entity29 in recent generations			2
@entity160 's plan also would overhaul key portions of the tax code , dropping the top rate for individuals and businesses to 25 % while eliminating a number of loopholes			0
the @entity5 is expected to pass the @entity160 proposal friday			0
@entity44 , however , are certain to block the measure			2
@entity7 's budget plan , outlined in wednesday 's speech , aims to cut deficits by a combined $ 4 trillion over the next 12 years without significantly changing @entity170 and @entity180			1
the president 's plan includes a repeal of the @entity131 - era tax cuts on families making more than $ 250,000 annually -- something sought by @entity44 but strongly opposed by @entity26			2
@entity7 also called for the creation of a " debt fail - safe " trigger that would impose automatic across - the - board spending cuts and tax changes in coming years if annual deficits are on track to exceed 2.8 % of the nation 's gross domestic product			1
the president claimed that by building on or adjusting the health care reform bill passed last year , $ 480 billion would be saved by 2023 , followed by an additional $ 1 trillion in the following decade			2
he proposed tightly constraining the growth in @entity170 costs starting in 2018			0
the rhetoric over the two leaders ' respective plans has become increasingly heated in recent days			0
in the @entity106 interview , @entity7 framed what he called the two choices that will face voters in the 2012 vote			1
" we ca n't get everything the government offers and not pay for it , " @entity7 said			2
" either we do n't pay for it , in which case we have a society that is not caring for our seniors the way it should , is not providing some basic security for people who really need it , and is not investing in the future			2
" or we can decide to continue on the path that has made us the greatest country on @entity248 , " the president continued			0
have a basic social safety net			0
and we can do it without hurting the middle class or fundamentally changing these programs			0
" earlier , @entity68 sen. @entity254 of @entity255 said the @entity160 plan would lower the tax rates on @entity29 's wealthy to the lowest levels " since 1931 when @entity258 was president			0
" " talk about trying to turn back the clock , " said @entity254 , who also pledged that " no plan to end @entity170 as we know it will ever , ever pass the @entity6			0
" @entity160 , meanwhile , ripped @entity7 on thursday for using " demagogic terms and comparisons			2
" the president 's plan is " fundamentally unserious , " @entity160 said			0
@entity7 has brought himself " down to the level of the partisan mosh pit " and made it tougher for the two parties to reach an agreement , he said			1
against that backdrop , @entity44 and @entity26 also have to contend with an impending vote to raise the nation 's debt ceiling			1
@entity13 needs to raise the limit before the federal government reaches its legal borrowing limit of $ 14.29 trillion later this year or risk a default that could result in a crashing dollar and spiraling interest rates , among other things			2
@entity26 leaders have stressed that any vote to raise the cap has to be tied to another round of spending cuts or fiscal reforms			1
the administration , in contrast , has called for a " clean " vote on the cap , which would raise the limit without adding any conditions			0
@entity5 press secretary @entity294 has warned that trying to force the issue would be tantamount to playing a game of " chicken " with the economy			0
@entity1 's @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 and @entity303 contributed to this report			0

new : @entity7 tells @entity106 that some fiscal issues wo n't get resolved before the 2012 vote
@entity13 passes the budget measure for the rest of the @entity311
democrats and @entity26 remain at sharp odds over the fiscal year 2012 budget
the two parties also have to reach an agreement over raising the debt ceiling
