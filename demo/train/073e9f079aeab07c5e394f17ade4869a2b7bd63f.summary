@entity0 -- bullying and harassment in schools often includes violations of federally protected civil rights , the federal government warned tuesday in new guidelines for educators on how to address the problem			1
if school administrators fail to properly deal with harassment based on gender , race or other issues , they risk being cited for contributing to a pattern of civil rights violations that could , in extreme cases , lead to a cut in federal funding , according to top officials who spoke to reporters on a conference call about the new guidelines			1
" in extreme cases , schools could be stripped of their federal education monies if they do n't comply with all of our civil rights laws , " said @entity26 , assistant secretary for civil rights			2
also on the call were @entity32 , secretary of education , and @entity35 director @entity34			0
the issue of harassment gained prominence this year after a spate of suicides by students who were being bullied			0
president @entity42 has called for greater awareness of the problem , saying the nation must " dispel the myth that bullying is just a normal rite of passage or an inevitable part of growing up			0

in a statement tuesday , the @entity80 welcomed the new government guidelines for making clear that most religious , gender and sexual harassment comes under federal civil rights prohibitions , but it called for expanding the federal law to eliminate any doubt			2
