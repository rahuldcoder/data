-- it 's just over a week until one of the biggest geek gatherings of the year , @entity2 , kicks off in @entity5 , @entity6			0
@entity7 is where fledgling tech companies sink or swim			2
@entity9 and @entity10 caught on in part thanks to massive buzz at @entity7 , while thousands of other new companies dreamed the " @entity15 " dream but went nowhere			2
so which new technologies might we expect to see breaking out at @entity7 ? applications set to go mainstream the @entity20 3 , which will be announced by @entity21 two days before @entity22 kicks off , will be a big topic in @entity5			2
developers at the festival will no doubt be rushing to update their applications to work with what is expected to be a higher resolution screen on the device			0
a handful of emerging companies also will continue to gain momentum : the mobile journal @entity33 has achieved some success with the early adopter crowd after its latest update , while the social nature of photo - sharing app @entity37 is bound to make it a favorite at @entity7			1
@entity42 , the fast - growing darling of the online - scrapbooking set , also will be in @entity5			0
new startups my bet for the breakout trend at this year 's @entity7 is " ambient social networking			1
" while the last crop of mobile apps involved " checking in " to venues to find friends , many smartphones are now able to continually discover your location and broadcast it			1
once you log in with @entity58 , @entity10 and other existing social networks , new mobile applications can alert you when a friend , or even a friend of a friend , is in the vicinity			2
some even tell you when people nearby share your interests			1
which app names might you be hearing if this trend takes off ? perhaps @entity69 , which analyzes your @entity10 , @entity58 and @entity9 networks to see if any friends -- or friends of friends -- are nearby			1
or @entity75 , which alerts you when people with similar interests are , say , in the bar next door			0
@entity80 alerts you about friends you did n't know were nearby , while @entity82 lets you see when your @entity58 contacts are around			0
tech enthusiast @entity85 predicts @entity82 will be " the hot app at @entity7 this year			1
" @entity87 the potential problem should be obvious : privacy			0
this new generation of apps broadcasts your location at all times to friends -- and in many cases to people you do n't even know			1
the physical distance at which alerts are sent varies , but some app developers propose that being in the same city as a contact would be enough to trigger a message			0
and unlike the previous generations of applications that required you to check in to a venue , these apps are persistent unless you pause them or turn them off			0
the potential for both hilarity and calamity is clear			0
so the real question is : how comfortable are early adopters with ambient social networking ? and if they enjoy the experience , will mainstream users catch on fast -- or will privacy concerns scare them away ? at @entity7 , we hope to find out .			1

@entity119 : breakout trend at @entity7 this month may be " ambient social networking "
apps would *automatically* share info about you with nearby people in your networks
@entity129 is becoming an issue as more apps allow people to broadcast their location
the social nature of photo - sharing app @entity37 also may make it a favorite at @entity7
