@entity0 -- president @entity2 embarks on a two - day @entity4 road trip tuesday to assess and amplify his government 's response to two unconnected overseas emergencies -- the @entity9 outbreak in @entity10 and @entity12 terrorists in @entity13 and @entity14			1
on tuesday @entity2 will announce significant new @entity4 efforts to combat the @entity9 epidemic , which has moved quickly across the western part of @entity10 and sent governments there scrambling to respond			1
the plan , which he 'll announce at the @entity23 headquarters of the @entity24 , includes new military assistance to the region and an increase in trained medical professionals sent to help			0
on wednesday , @entity2 heads further south to assess his mission against @entity30 at @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33			1
@entity9 's spread is unrelated to the @entity4 mission to degrade @entity30 terrorists in @entity13 and @entity14			1
but both have prompted worry among @entity4 about their personal safety and led to charges the @entity41 is n't doing enough to combat the hazards			1
the dual foreign plagues have yet to pose an immediate threat to the @entity4 homeland , the @entity41 says , though each has claimed the lives of @entity4 abroad			2
and officials say both @entity9 and @entity30 could grow to become unmanageable problems if action is n't taken now to stamp them out			2
the president 's stop tuesday at the @entity24 comes amid escalating criticism from health experts on the global response to the @entity9 outbreak in @entity10 , where almost 2,500 people have died			1
at the @entity4 public health agency @entity2 will be briefed on the outbreak and speak to officials there about how the @entity4 is responding			2
afterwards he 'll announce new @entity4 commitments in combating the virus ' spread			0
working through the @entity65 , the @entity4 will plan and construct treatment centers that could house up to 1,700 beds , administration officials said			1
with a @entity4 general leading the effort from @entity73 's capital of @entity74 , @entity4 military personnel in the region could increase by 3,000			0
medics and other uniformed professionals will work to train up to 500 health care workers per week in identifying and caring for people with @entity9			0
the @entity4 government also hopes to send 400,000 treatment kits with sanitizer and other items to at - risk homes , an attempt to contain the disease			0
public health campaigns will be broadcast through existing networks in the countries most affected by the virus : @entity73 , @entity90 and @entity91			0
officials hope a more coordinated logistical situation on the ground , put in place by the @entity4 , will encourage other nations to step up their own efforts in fighting @entity9 , which experts worry could spread even more rapidly if more is n't done now to contain it			2
" we 've seen dozens of cases turn into hundreds , then hundreds turn into thousands , " one @entity4 administration official said			0
" if we do not arrest that growth , and do n't arrest that growth now , we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of cases			0
" epidemiologists and others who are monitoring the disease have claimed developed countries like the @entity4 have n't sent enough resources to the region , and @entity4 officials acknowledge that tuesday 's announcement reflects the fact that more needs to be done to stop @entity9 's spread			1
the @entity4 has committed more than $ 100 million in the effort to combat @entity9 , according to the @entity118 , and @entity2 plans to call on @entity119 to approve an additional $ 88 million as part of a bill to fund the federal government			1
last week @entity118 said it would spend $ 75 million to build treatment facilities and supply them with medical equipment			0
the @entity65 says it 's working to shift $ 500 million of currently not yet obligated funds toward the @entity9 effort			0
the efforts of the @entity4 -- deemed more extensive than any previous @entity4 response to an epidemic -- have so far been unable to stop the spread of the deadly virus , which @entity2 and @entity41 officials are calling a national security problem			1
particularly concerning , @entity4 officials say , is the potential for instability in the countries where @entity9 is rampant and the possibility for the virus to mutate into a more dangerous form			2
@entity9 currently only transmits though contact with bodily fluids ; a mutation that allows the virus to spread through the air would pose a catastrophic threat to human populations worldwide , health experts say			0
speaking monday , @entity41 press secretary @entity145 said there was still a " very low " likelihood the ebola virus could mutate in a way that poses a threat to the @entity4			2
" right now , the risk of an @entity9 outbreak in the @entity4 is very low , but that risk would only increase if there were not a robust response on the part of the @entity4 , " @entity145 said			1
the potential for increased risk to the @entity4 homeland has also inspired the more robust response to @entity30 terrorists , who @entity2 announced last week would be the target of an air campaign inside @entity13 and @entity14			1
that mission is run from @entity31 in @entity32 , where @entity2 will receive a briefing on battle plans wednesday			0
the @entity41 said the president would also visit servicemen and women during his stop at the facility			0
@entity2 and his aides maintain that @entity30 fighters do n't currently pose a direct threat to the @entity4 homeland but warn of the potential for militants with @entity4 or @entity178 passports to return home and stage an attack remains a top concern			1
secretary of state @entity182 has been engaging @entity184 and @entity185 nations in building a coalition to fight @entity30 , though levels of commitment from foreign partners has remained vague .			0
