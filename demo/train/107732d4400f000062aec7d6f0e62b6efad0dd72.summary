@entity0 -- " i have a bomb ! " a wheelchair bound man shouted , holding what looked like a homemade bomb			1
" stay away from me			2
" minutes earlier , @entity8 had wheeled himself into @entity10 's arrivals terminal			2
as he began to distribute leaflets to publicize his cause , he was stopped by airport security			2
arriving passengers walked past him , seemingly oblivious to the looming danger			0
@entity8 had written on his personal blog in 2006 that he had been attacked and beaten by security guards outside a police station in @entity19 in 2005 after carrying a passenger on his motorcycle			0
he was paralyzed after the incident and petitioned for official compensation			1
shortly after his standoff with airport security , the disgruntled petitioner detonated his device , causing a minor explosion and injuring his arm			2
a policeman also suffered minor injuries but there were no other casualties , except perhaps @entity35 's fragile facade of stability			1
sympathy the country 's mainstream and social media covered the explosion and its aftermath			1
rather than decry what was an act of terror , many people sympathized with @entity8 -- some even depicted him as a hero for warning people away before setting off the bomb			2
but an editorial in the state - controlled @entity48 this week stated that although cases like @entity8 's were sad , extremism by victims was not " tolerable			1
" " it 's important to remember that @entity8 should be condemned and dealt with by law			0
his grievances ca n't provide moral support for his extreme actions , nor can they shield him from legal punishment , " the editorial stated			1
" behind extreme crimes at the cost of self - harm , there are often unfortunate stories of suffering and tears			2
we support and call for the authorities to investigate those sad stories and consider investigation to be an important element that can not be neglected when tackling extreme cases			0
" central concern authorities will also be worried that @entity8 's act may spawn similar actions @entity8 's act was the latest in a number of incidents involving petitioners airing grievances and seeking social justice			1
in 2011 , @entity80 , a 52 - year - old unemployed man , set off consecutive explosions in three government buildings in @entity84 province , killing two -- including the bomber himself -- and injuring ten people			1
@entity80 , it turned out , had been trying to seek redress for the loss of his property , which he claimed was illegally demolished by local authorities			0
" ten years of fruitlessly trying to seek redress have forced me to go on a path i did not wish to make , " he had posted on @entity93 , @entity35 's @entity94 - like microblog			1
while these sad tales have become more frequent , they are not new			0
i 've seen this replayed many times			0
annual petition the @entity103 practice of going to @entity0 to " shangfang " ( petition ) is centuries old , dating back to the days when aggrieved citizens could petition the emperor			1
every year , ahead of the annual meeting of @entity35 's legislature in @entity0 , police take away thousands of petitioners from around the country seeking redress for problems with local officials			1
many of them phone media offices like ours to seek help , or to simply vent their frustrations			2
every month or so , we receive packets in the mail containing handwritten accounts and pictures , recounting their sad stories			0
@entity35 is grappling with an acknowledged rise in social unrest , sparked by public anger over land grabs without proper compensation , official corruption , the growing gap between the rich and the poor and environmental damage			1
abusive behavior allegations of official abuse and police brutality are common			2
spontaneous riots are also frequent			0
in central @entity140 province , for example , watermelon vendor @entity136 , 56 , recently died after he and his wife were beaten up by six officers of " chengguan , " the @entity145 forces , prompting online uproar and detention of the officers			0
such abusive behavior has put the spotlight on the problem of the " chengguan , " the para-police agency tasked with enforcing non-criminal city regulations			0
although it has no legal authority to detain suspects , critics say , they frequently do so and sometimes even resort to " enhanced interrogation			0
" they confiscate merchandise and impose arbitrary fines , leading critics to suspect corruption			2
they are also known to collude with property developers to evict people			0
growing discontent human rights groups have called on the @entity103 government to clip the chengguan 's powers and investigate its violent acts			1
" the chengguan are not protecting the safety of @entity103 citizens , they 're actively undermining it , " said @entity174 , @entity35 director at @entity175			1
" the @entity103 government can signal that it 's serious about meaningful rule of law by ending chengguan abuses and impunity			1
" the @entity103 leadership recognizes the risks posed by growing social discontent , but seems unable to find fundamental solutions			1
it fears that political liberalization might lead to massive " dongluan " ( chaos )			0
such fear drives the @entity103 leaders to seemingly contradictory policies and behavior			1
instead of addressing legitimate complaints , officials tend to resort to force and intimidation			0
many cities have set up elite police squads to deal with riots and " terrorism			0
" they say they encourage " whistleblowers " to expose abuses , but when they aim at abusive officials , they get muzzled			0
@entity210 , one of @entity35 's most influential bloggers , recently had his @entity93 account suspended after he posted a pointed essay about @entity8 's case			1
@entity8 , 34 , had long been silenced by a system that tolerates little dissent , he said			0
' festering away ' the @entity19 native has been paralyzed since 2005 , when he was allegedly beaten up by several " chengguan " officers while working as an unlicensed motorcycle driver in southern @entity221 province			0
he was suing for damages , asking for over 334,000 yuan ( about us $ 53,000 ) but to no avail			0
" i am now festering away , paralyzed and over 100,000 yuan in debt , " he posted on his blog that has since been deleted			0
" the only thing that is keeping me going is the thought of seeking justice			1
" in desperation , @entity8 brought his struggle for justice to @entity0 , adding his voice to the chorus of discontent			1
@entity103 political scientist @entity235 says @entity103 leaders can ignore this rising chorus at their own peril			1
" the airport bombing shows that when people are hopeless they will resort to more violence , " he explained			2
" it 's dangerous because next time someone will think , if no one listens , take even more radical steps , then your voice can reach the top and your case can be solved			0
" @entity210 , author of the book " @entity252 of @entity253 in @entity35 , " believes the old petition system has very limited role			2
" the @entity103 government should give people more space , to be able to speak out and participate in local affairs			2
it 's a good way to defuse the anger of the people , " said the @entity0 - based political scientist			1
" otherwise there will just be more and more protests			0

many on @entity103 social media sympathized with plight of @entity0 airport " bomber "
but an editorial in state - controlled @entity48 said this action is never justified
incident the latest involving petitioners airing grievances and seeking social justice
