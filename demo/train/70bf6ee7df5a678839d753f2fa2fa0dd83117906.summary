" @entity12 , 59 , of @entity18 , @entity19 , had been on trial for murder at @entity22 , with prosecutors seeking a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity that would have resulted in psychiatric custody			1
but they said a closer study of evidence led them to believe the defendant should be released without further action			0
