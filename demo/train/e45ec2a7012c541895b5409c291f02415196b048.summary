-- @entity2 's new album " @entity3 " is inspired by his estranged wife @entity4 , but he has n't seen the woman herself in months			1
that 's what the singer told @entity10 radio station @entity9 on tuesday , assuring the station 's morning show co-hosts that his breakup is n't just pr. " i try to keep most of that private , but i have n't seen her for four months , " @entity2 said			1
" i still had so much i wanted to apologize for and things i wanted to take responsibility for , that 's pretty much what the album 's about			2
... the album is exactly what happens when you lose the love of your life and you 're trying to figure it out in your head : ' how am i going to move on , get through it all ? ' " the 37 - year - old singer is the first to admit that he 's unsure if he 's going about that in the right way			2
" i actually have no idea what i 'm doing , " he told " @entity35 " tuesday			0
" i 'm just kind of flying by the seat of my pants on this one			0
i just wanted to make something artistic out of a very difficult period			0
" @entity2 and his actress wife have known each other and dated since they were teens , eventually tying the knot in 2005			1
yet in february , the couple announced that they 'd mutually decided to separate and co-parent their 4 - year - old son , @entity45			1
it seems @entity2 has been obsessed ever since with wooing 38 - year - old @entity48 , making public apologies , writing songs like " @entity51 , " and filming an uncomfortably intimate music video that has become the gold standard of over-sharing			1
some said the breakup was due to @entity2 's rumored infidelity , and while the singer did n't divulge details on tuesday , he did confess to being dishonest			1
" i 'm a man			0
i messed up , and i had to lie for awhile , " @entity2 told @entity9			2
" and then i stopped lying			0
and that was actually good for me , because i was tired of lying			0
so this whole album is me revealing everything			0
" but is @entity4 listening ? does n't sound like it			2
" she has n't heard ( ' @entity3 ' ) , " @entity2 said of his estranged wife			1
" she 's only heard a few songs , and i do n't think she wants to hear it right now			0
i ca n't speak for her , but space is an important part of any healing process			0
" # @entity72 backfires big time on @entity2 @entity2 is still trying to get @entity4 back			1
