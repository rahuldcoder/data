@entity0 -- six weeks after announcing an indefinite medical leave , @entity3 ceo @entity2 surprised a lot of people when he took the stage wednesday to unveil his company 's next - generation @entity8			1
the audience at @entity3 's event gave him a standing ovation and tech bloggers immediately and breathlessly tweeted out the news			1
" that he came out on stage will go down in history as a big deal , " said @entity15 , a @entity16 analyst			0
" it 's a significant gesture			0
" @entity2 was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003			2
he had a liver transplant in 2009			0
on january 17 , he took his second leave from the company in the past two years			0
speculation about @entity2 ' health had increased in recent weeks , with tabloids weighing in with unsubstantiated reports			2
some of those rumors were tempered when @entity2 was photographed in february attending a private dinner with president @entity31 and other @entity33 elite			2
still , many observers had expected another @entity3 exec , possibly coo @entity35 or marketing chief @entity36 , to fill in for him wednesday			1
but there was @entity2 , looking thin but happy and vigorous			2
whatever health concerns prompted his most recent leave did n't seem to affect his flair as an @entity3 pitchman			1
" we 've been working on this product for a long time , and i just did n't want to miss the day , " @entity2 said			2
he smiled often throughout his presentation , paced back and forth on stage and cracked jokes about the white @entity47 that @entity3 has yet to sell			0
he also characteristically took jabs at competitors such as @entity50 , saying @entity52 tablets lack enough apps			0
afterward , @entity2 did n't venture out to the demo room , where he sometimes greets reporters and guests who are getting a first look at new products			0
@entity3 executives @entity36 , @entity60 and @entity61 were there instead			0
several observers noted that @entity2 added a black belt to his trademark black - mock turtleneck - and - jeans ensemble , which either makes him a ninja or a man wearing loose - fitting pants			1
the @entity3 co-founder 's current leave has sparked concern among his cult - like followers and even spooked some investors			1
a proposal for @entity3 to outline a succession plan for its executives failed to pass at a shareholders ' meeting at the company 's @entity82 , @entity83 , headquarters last week			2
but the health of @entity3 's chief , who runs the most highly valued tech company in the world , is more important to shareholders than it is to most of its customers , said @entity92 , a @entity93 analyst focusing on personal computing			1
" i do n't think the average person cares what 's going on with @entity3 's leader , " she said			1
@entity2 ' appearance threatened to overshadow the @entity8 launch and may alleviate some criticisms that the tablet computer is n't a major upgrade over the original			0
he said the similar - looking @entity8 2 has " an all - new design , " among other improvements			0
@entity107 's @entity106 broke the news late tuesday that @entity2 was considering an appearance at the event			1
" what would be a welcome change in the coverage of @entity2 ' personal struggles would be to show a level of respect to him by paying more attention to what bells and whistles the ipad 2 has rather than to how his jeans are fitting , " she wrote			1
" that 's the truly dramatic story to watch here , rather than needlessly rubbernecking about the struggles of one man -- albeit , a very significant man -- to regain his health			0
" @entity2 concluded wednesday 's presentation with a touch of sentimentality that also graced his january statement in announcing his medical leave			1
" as always , i 'd also like to thank everyone 's families because they support us and let us do what we love to do , " he said .			0
