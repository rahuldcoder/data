@entity0 -- four days after the biggest rainstorm in six decades hit the @entity5 capital , @entity2 remains furious over what she perceives as government indifference to her family 's plight			1
" our family of five lives off one income , " said the 46 - year - old farmer wednesday			2
" nobody cares about us because there 's no official in this household			1
" @entity2 lives along what once was a paved road in the small village of @entity22 in @entity0 's southwestern @entity24 district , the area hit hardest by the storm last weekend			1
a flashflood has reduced the road to a muddy path littered with furniture , clothes and even a tin shed -- all objects washed away by powerful waters			0
more rain forecast as @entity0 mops up flood and comments water marks some two meters high stay visible on the exterior walls of a dozen houses by the road , while mud piles stand outside doorways with flies circling around garbage nearby			1
@entity2 says she largely relies on her husband 's monthly wage of $ 300 to take care of her family that includes the couple , their two children and her sick father - in - law			2
" everything was floating in water -- refrigerator , television , everything , " she said while showing a @entity1 crew her just - dried kitchen and living room			2
" i borrowed money to renovate the house and lost more than 100,000 yuan ( $ 15,000 )			0
" @entity2 and her neighbors alike remember a fearful night spent in dark attics or higher ground after carrying the elderly and children out of fast - rising water -- all the while unable to reach anyone at the city 's flood control hotline			1
one neighbor , @entity77 , added that she feels even more shaken by the village officials ' response when she told them the flood has ruined almost all her worldly possessions			1
" they actually said : ' if your house did n't collapse and nobody died , then you 're not a victim , ' " she said , raising her voice			0
" i asked : are you still human ? " torrential rain kills at least 28 in southern @entity91 villagers like @entity2 and @entity93 blame local officials for their decision to cover a former waterway with concrete -- thus turning it to a road and diminishing drainage capacity -- and their failure to warn residents before the storm			1
" it was more than a natural disaster , " @entity93 said			0
" the officials are responsible too			2
" @entity24 authorities have acknowledged shortcomings in the local drainage system , telling reporters they have learned their lessons and will address people 's concerns			1
they also insist the need to prioritize their effort in a district where the storm has affected 800,000 residents , cost at least $ 1 billion in economic losses , and the death toll is expected to rise significantly			1
for some villagers of @entity22 , however , such words hardly resonate			2
as loudspeakers mounted throughout the village began to broadcast propaganda messages touting rapid government aid to victims , @entity122 scoffed			0
" why bother howling now ? where were they when we needed help ? " the 60 - year - old resident asked			0
" this is a place led by the @entity134			0
where is our equality ? " not long after the loudspeakers turned quiet , local officials showed up in two white vans to deliver bottled water , instant noodles and blankets to residents affected by the flood			1
a shouting match soon broke out between a village party official and a resident living by the water - ripped road whose home was totally flooded			2
" i have to take the overall situation into consideration -- there are many others who are much worse off than you , " the official shouted at a fuming @entity153			0
" i do n't want your damn stuff , " @entity2 yelled back			0
" my husband is a @entity134 member so i was asked to keep quiet , " she later explained , wiping tears off			0
" but i ca n't bear it anymore -- how dare he come to my home to insult me by saying my loss is nothing ? " extreme weather : get ready to see more of it			0
