-- nobody would have predicted this			0
a team coming off the back of a mediocre season with a newly - appointed , unheralded coach , sitting at the top of the @entity9 table after a run of nine successive victories			1
no team in @entity14 football has made a better start to the 2013 - 14 season than @entity17 ; no team in @entity20 football history has ever made a better start to a @entity9 season			1
a handful of vibrant new recruits and a wily old - timer have all combined to lift the club to the top of the table , with @entity17 's form attracting admiring glances from around the world			1
" what i really like about this @entity17 team is that they play with a strong mentality , " @entity20 football expert @entity32 told @entity0			2
" they play with such intensity and have a winning mentality , " added the former @entity37 chief executive			0
with many scratching their heads as to how this incredible run has been put together , @entity0 gives you five reasons why @entity46 's team are the toast of the continent			1
@entity46 @entity46 's arrival at @entity17 in june went largely unnoticed , the @entity50 replacing @entity51 after an unspectacular sixth - place finish in the 2012 - 13 campaign			1
the @entity50 won the @entity55 title with @entity56 in 2011 , a team which featured players like @entity59 ( more on him later ) and @entity61 star @entity60 , but arguably @entity46 had flown under the radar of all but the most - discerning @entity14 football fans			2
" he has a very strong personality , he is very articulate and commands huge respect , " @entity50 football expert @entity64 told @entity0			0
" i recently talked to @entity60 and he was speaking about @entity61 manger @entity68 's insistence on taking care of defensive duties			0
he said that approach is similar to @entity46 and that speaks volumes about the thoroughness of his preparations			2
" @entity46 is one of a small band of @entity50 coaches to have worked in @entity79 's top division and the 49 - year - old has faced his fair share of doubters during his first six months in @entity83			1
" his success has been a huge surprise , " added @entity64			0
" @entity50 has exported a lot of players to @entity79 , but when he went to @entity17 there was a negative reaction that this guy was a ' no - hoper '			2
" @entity46 's success is made all the more remarkable given the pressures which weigh on the shoulders of any @entity17 coach			1
despite having left @entity37 earlier this year , @entity32 remains in touch with former @entity17 player and coach @entity97 , who is currently in charge at the @entity55 club			1
the @entity101 said : " @entity97 told me that @entity17 is probably the toughest job in the world given the pressure and focus from outside the club			2
" @entity46 has also done well to utilize the considerable talents of club captain @entity107 , a player who is idolized by the @entity108 and whose exclusion from the side can result in uproar			1
" @entity107 is a talisman for @entity17 , but that also creates problems for any incoming coach , " explained @entity32			1
" he is a @entity114 to the club 's fans and you would n't want to be the coach that ends his career			2
you 'd imagine that the other players look up to him and he is strong influence in the dressing room			0
" he is a leader , who is deeply attached to @entity17 and wants the best for his team and city			0
" market trading @entity17 's smart preseason trading has been another factor in their record - breaking start			1
@entity134 winger @entity133 and @entity134 - born @entity79 striker @entity132 were both sold to @entity136 clubs , @entity135 and @entity137 respectively , in big - money deals , giving @entity17 scope to recruit some exciting talents			0
@entity59 arrived from @entity141 , while sturdy @entity143 midfielder @entity142 -- " made for @entity20 football " according to @entity32 -- was signed from @entity145 despite reported interest from @entity147			0
@entity148 and @entity149 are two new recruits who have helped make up a formidable defence , along with veteran @entity153 right - back @entity152			0
@entity133 has been replaced by @entity154 , a @entity155 who joined @entity17 from @entity157 and who has already scored three times in six appearances			0
" you have to praise the technical director @entity162 -- and he deserves a lot of credit , " added @entity32			0
" the first part of the transfer window they were just a selling club , but @entity162 kept a cool head , bought the right players at the right price at the right moment having made a profit of 40 million euros			0
" a water tight defence nine games played , nine games won and one goal conceded			0
@entity178 are the only team to have breached @entity14 's meanest defence , taking the lead in a match @entity17 went on to win 3 - 1			1
goalkeeper @entity148 arrived from @entity182 for a modest $ 690,000 in july and he has enjoyed a near faultless start to his career in the @entity20 capital , stationed behind the center back pairing of @entity20 international @entity188 and @entity191 's @entity190			0
@entity17 's latest win , a 1 - 0 success at @entity194 , was proof of their defensive steel			1
down to 10 men , without the services of attacking talisman @entity107 and in - form winger @entity59 , @entity17 ground out a 1 - 0 win to become the first visiting team to take three points from @entity204 since september 2012			1
" congratulations to my team - mates , " said @entity107 on his website after the match			0
" each one showed courage , strength and , as we say around here , two massive balls ! " @entity107 like the @entity215 and the @entity216 , @entity107 is an immovable monument on the landscape of the @entity83			0
the flamboyant attacker is @entity17 's captain and the definition of a one - club man			1
since making his debut in 1992 , @entity107 has made 542 appearances for the @entity224 , scoring 230 goals			0
as @entity17 's official website says , " the number 10 is without question the best player in the club 's history			1
" @entity107 's form this season has been imperious , with the veteran scoring three goals and contributing six assists			2
his standout performance of @entity17 's winning run came away at @entity239 , where he found the net twice in a convincing 3 - 0 triumph			1
his performances have led to calls for him to return to the @entity79 team for the first time since 2006			0
his last match for the @entity79 was the penalty shootout triumph over @entity50 in the 2006 world cup final , with current national coach @entity249 suggesting a fit and in - form @entity107 would be a shoo - in for a place at @entity252 2014			2
@entity59 another attacking star of @entity17 's renaissance has been @entity59 , the @entity255 forward who has thus far proved to be a shrewd acquisition from @entity257 team @entity141			1
@entity59 's two - year stay in @entity136 was largely unremarkable as he developed a reputation for missing chances			0
his preseason move to @entity17 saw him reunited with @entity46 , who was his coach during a successful stay in @entity50 with @entity56 , and it has paid dividends			1
three goals and one assist from a player who managed just six @entity257 goals in his final season with @entity141 is an impressive return , hinting that @entity59 could be ready to fulfill the promise he showed during he and @entity46 's first spell together .			2
