-- be bold ! think big ! @entity1 wants to do just that			1
an $ 800 billion economic stimulus plan			1
@entity1 's popularity with voters will win him influence with political opponents			1
@entity1 won the biggest @entity11 majority for president in 44 years			2
his party made big gains in @entity15			2
@entity11 now have a majority of nearly 60 percent in both the @entity17 and @entity18			2
president @entity1 's got a mandate			2
what 's to stop him ? just this : the @entity24 system of government			1
it is set up to make it difficult to get things done			2
the @entity30 was written 222 years ago by men who did n't trust government			1
they had just waged a revolution against a king			2
to the founders of the @entity24 republic , strong government meant despotism			1
so they set up a system with an elaborate separation of powers			2
the idea was to ensure weak government			1
the dirty little secret of @entity24 government is that it was designed not to work very well			1
as president after president has discovered , there are innumerable ways opponents can stop measures from getting passed , even if the president 's party holds a majority in @entity15			2
the @entity18 has its own rule that 's not in the @entity30 requiring a super-majority of 60 @entity18 votes to control the agenda			2
a minority of 41 senators can " filibuster '' a measure and prevent it from coming up for a vote			2
how many votes will @entity65 have in the @entity18 ? 41 or 42 , depending on the outcome in @entity68 where ballots are still being counted			2
presidents often have problems holding their own party together			0
that 's because members of @entity15 are elected by local constituencies and they are expected to represent local interests			0
@entity24 politicians are independent political entrepreneurs			1
they are not foot - soldiers of a party			0
when @entity82 first became president , he had a solid @entity11 majority in @entity15			0
but he could not get his health care reform plan passed			0
after an intense advertising campaign by opponents , many @entity24 were worried that the @entity88 were planning a government takeover of the health care system			1
the @entity82 plan failed , and within two years , @entity11 lost their majority in @entity15			0
one - party control did n't work any better for @entity95			0
@entity95 had trouble getting what he wanted -- notably , immigration reform -- from a @entity15			0
republicans lost their majority in @entity15 in 2006			0
but here 's another dirty little secret of @entity24 government : it often does work			1
under the right conditions , barriers fall away and things get done , sometimes with amazing speed and efficiency			1
what are the right conditions ? an overwhelming sense of public urgency			0
that sense of urgency certainly existed after 9/11 , when @entity15 quickly passed the @entity114			0
getting anything big done in @entity24 government requires a sense of crisis			1
that 's why politicians in the @entity24 are always declaring crises -- a drug crisis , an education crisis , an environmental crisis			1
or they 're trying to rally the country to fight a war on something -- a war on poverty , a war on crime			0
if the public urgency is not authentic , however , opponents wo n't have much trouble stopping things from happening			0
@entity1 certainly takes office at a time of crisis , just as @entity138 and @entity139 did			1
like them , he has the opportunity to transform @entity24 government			1
members of @entity15 who try to block president @entity1 's program may find themselves in political trouble			0
because there is yet another dirty little secret of @entity24 government : the @entity24 is the most populist democracy in the world			1
here , the people rule			0
when the people want something , they will get it , whether it 's the death penalty or gun rights or lower taxes			0
why does n't the @entity24 have a metric system or dollar coins like other countries ? because the people wo n't use them			1
@entity1 's popularity is soaring right now			0
when a president is popular , he has clout			0
everyone wants to be on his side , even members of the opposition party			0
they 're in business for themselves , and supporting a popular president is good for business			0
standing in his way could drive them out of business			0
@entity24 government is not an efficient , well - oiled machine			1
it was never designed to be			1
it has to be lubricated by public pressure			0
if the people are shouting " do something ! '' -- as they are right now -- then something will happen			0
even if it means a lot more spending and a lot more government			1
the people reserve one key right : they will let the government know , rather quickly , whether or not it 's working .			1

three secrets behind the way @entity24 government works
it was designed to ensure weak government
in times of crisis usual barriers fall away
if voters want something done , it will get done somehow
