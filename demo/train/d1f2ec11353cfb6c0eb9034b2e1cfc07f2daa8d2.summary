-- an alleged gang member who police say was behind 80 percent of the killings in @entity5 , @entity6 , over the past 16 months was arrested over the weekend , officials said			1
police believe that @entity8 , known as " @entity9 , " was the leader of the @entity11 gang , a group closely linked with the @entity5 cartel and its enforcement arm , @entity15			1
@entity17 confessed to authorities that he ordered the killings of three people linked to the @entity22 consulate in @entity5 in march , as well as the attack on a party of young people that killed 14 , federal police said			1
the 32 - year - old was arrested saturday			1
@entity17 " is allegedly responsible for homicides , extortions and distribution of drugs in all the sectors of @entity5 , " the federal police said in a statement			1
he was captured as part of an operation to dismantle the @entity11 gang , police said			1
surveillance and tips from the public led authorities to a house occupied by armed men , where @entity17 was arrested			1
according to authorities , the gang leader also admitted to the killings of five federal police officers			1
two others were captured along with @entity17			2
@entity48 , 41 , is accused of smuggling drugs between @entity5 and @entity50 , @entity51			2
@entity53 , 32 , was identified as being in charge of transporting drugs and weapons to @entity5 , police said			1
police seized two assault rifles and two handguns , along with 228 cartridges for different weapons			0
they also found 90 grams of what police believe is marijuana			0
two cars and two trucks , including one that was armored , were also taken			0
in 1996 , @entity17 was arrested in the @entity22 for drug trafficking , @entity6 authorities said			1
there have been more than 2,500 drug - related killings in @entity5 this year alone , signifying that if @entity17 ' claim is accurate , he would be responsible for more than 2,000 murders			1
those numbers would be comparable to those of some of the most ruthless war criminals			0
but @entity81 , a professor of political science at the @entity83 at @entity50 , said that such staggering statistics must be examined with skepticism			0
the number does not specify whether he was directly responsible for those deaths or marginally linked through his role in the gang			0
still , " no doubt this is a big bust , " @entity81 said , describing @entity17 as one of the heads of the @entity94 gang			1
the @entity94 gang is dedicated to doing the bidding of the @entity5 cartel and is in a battle with a rival gang , the @entity99 , who work for the @entity97			2
as a whole , the @entity94 gang is certainly responsible for thousands of deaths over the past four years , @entity81 said			2
@entity17 was key because he worked closely with the juarez cartel leadership and directed side enterprises , such as robbery , extortion and kidnappings			0
" he 's probably the brains behind the strategy of a self - financing gang , " @entity81 said			0
the arrest is a victory for president @entity114 's offensive against the drug cartels , and taken together with other recent killings or arrests of high - level leaders , shows the police strategy , @entity81 said : to go after the big fish in the drug trafficking organizations			0
" to cut the legs off at the street level , we have to cut the head , " he said of the plan			0
among the killings @entity17 admitted to are the high - profile shooting deaths of three people linked to the @entity22 consulate in the city			2
the shootings occurred march 13 when consulate employee @entity133 and her husband , @entity134 , were gunned down as they left a birthday party in their suv			0
@entity137 , the husband of another consulate employee , was killed in a separate vehicle			0
because @entity17 ' arrest might be linked to the ongoing investigation into the killings of the @entity22 , an @entity141 spokesman declined to comment on the development .			2

@entity17 was arrested saturday
he is the leader of the @entity11 gang in @entity5
police say he was behind 80 percent of the killings there over the past 16 months
