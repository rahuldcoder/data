-- urban exploration is an edgy pastime			1
but give it a @entity5 name and this underground community , known for seeking out derelict and often inaccessible environments , sounds even more hardcore			1
@entity9 is the @entity5 word for ruins and is the term used to describe urban exploration ( " urbex " ) , a growing trend for people to track down and often photograph society 's crumbling edifices			1
@entity19 in @entity5 plays out in much the same way it does in the rest of the world -- explorers are recreational trespassers who seek out abandoned , man - made structures , where they have a good poke around as they soak up the atmosphere			1
there are few hard and fast rules aside from the oft - quoted mantra -- " take nothing but photographs , leave only footprints " -- but there are a few aspects that are unique to urban exploration in @entity5			1
among these , abandoned amusement parks and sex museums			0
@entity41 @entity40 , a translator , has lived in @entity5 more than seven years and been a dedicated urbexer for almost five			1
he says he 's seen the hobby take off in @entity5 since he started			1
although there are no official numbers -- urbexers tend to be a low key , scattered community not least of all because of the potentially illegal aspects of the business , such as trespassing -- he says the number of urbex blogs has exploded from a dozen when he started to about 100 today , most of which are in @entity5			2
" there are tons of abandoned places in @entity5 , the problem is you have to find them , " says @entity40			1
that 's the part he most enjoys			0
he 's proud of the fact that more than 90 % of the places on his site , @entity70 , he has researched and found himself			1
as with most urbexers , he does n't give away exact locations , largely because he does n't want to see them overrun			0
' very , very weird ' the detective work does n't end when he 's found and explored a site			0
@entity40 likes to find out about the history of place			2
take those abandoned sex museums -- there are two in @entity5 , both of which have been deserted for more than 10 years			2
" in the 1960s , @entity84 had the sexual revolution , but that did n't happen in @entity5 -- they had sex museums , especially in onsen [ hot spring ] towns , " says @entity40			1
" there were 20 to 30 sex museums all over @entity5 , pretty much one in every prefecture			0
most of them closed from the beginning of the 1990s -- i guess the @entity99 killed them			0
" @entity40 has visited two abandoned @entity5 sex museums and although both have clearly been picked over and pilfered from , enough remains to make it clear what they were all about			1
the one in @entity105 he remembers best for the bizarre shooting games and taxidermy animals in sexual positions -- horses and monkeys			0
" you could say it was partly educational and very , very weird , " says @entity40			0
the other museum , in southern @entity5 , is filled with crumbling erotic statues and sculptures and an eerie naked mannequin in a white casket , her mutated nipples pointing in all directions			2
he found old advertising pamphlets that boasted of wax dolls of @entity124 and a 1970s erotic star , but these were long gone when he visited			0
other amusements the current hot haikyo site is an abandoned amusement park , @entity130 , says @entity40			2
it 's so popular that a security guard has been posted at the gate to try and keep out the curious			0
" technically , if there 's a security guard there it 's not abandoned , but it makes it onto all the lists and blogs , " says @entity40			2
@entity130 , built in 1961 and closed in 2006 , does make for dramatic images -- the abandoned , rusting rollercoaster set amid the desolate ruins of the theme park			0
if you 're after atmosphere , it 's got plenty			0
but what about the danger factor ? " i 'm a conservative explorer , i 've never been injured , but it 's definitely dangerous , " says @entity40			2
" there are all sorts of rusty things where you could get tetanus , there 's barbed wire and some military areas could still have ammunition -- a mine could go off			0
" for a sample of @entity40 's haikyo images , you can check out the above gallery or visit his site , @entity70 .			1

around the world , urban explorers hunt down and often photograph society 's crumbling edifices
in @entity5 , urban exploration is referred to as " haikyo , " the @entity5 word for " ruins "
@entity5 - based @entity40 *documents* his derelict findings on his blog , @entity70
