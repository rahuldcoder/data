-- @entity1 found a productive way to cope with her mid-life crisis			1
the accomplished academic turned to fiction writing			1
" some people buy expensive cars , " the 49 - year - old author says			2
" i wrote a novel			2
" it was n't just any novel , either			2
@entity1 ' debut , " @entity12 , " launched the best - selling " @entity17 " trilogy , which has been described by at least one reviewer as " @entity15 but for grown - ups			1
" while historian @entity1 had already published several academic books and articles , fiction writing was a new endeavor			1
@entity1 found freedom in looking into her imagination , rather than her research , while writing about a star - crossed witch and vampire			1
when she does n't know the answer to something she 's writing about , she can get creative , but she stayed true to her roots in history when she wrote the trilogy			1
( one character , @entity12 , is 1,500 years old and his paramour , @entity12 is a historian , herself )			1
" @entity36 , " came out in july and weaves together supernatural creatures and good old - fashioned family drama			1
in this series finale , the now - married protagonists wrestle with real world demons , as well as mythical creatures			2
in addition to her literary career , @entity1 teaches history at the @entity44 in @entity45			1
she spoke with @entity0 about love , literature and why the humanities still matter in academia			2
below is an edited transcript			2
@entity0 : how have you managed the transition from academic writer to fiction writer ? @entity1 : i never had a plan to be a fiction writer			1
it 's something that happened to me			2
sometimes i think maybe it was my spectacular mid-life crisis			0
some people buy expensive cars , and i wrote a novel			0
i think even if you had said to me in 2007 , " i predict you will write a novel next year , " i would have bet my house against it			0
there was no plan for it			0
i was so deeply involved in the world of scholarship , and indeed i still am			0
i reached a point where it was really a kind of interesting challenge to me , to think about how could i make the case to a wider audience that history and a knowledge of the past was meaningful and relevant			1
@entity0 : how has your experience of writing fiction informed your teaching ? @entity1 : i think it has made me a much better teacher of writing itself			1
after 20 years of writing academic prose and lectures , it seems very familiar and straightforward to me			1
writing a novel for the first time , i was reminded of just how difficult it is to figure out how to get this stuff done when you do n't really know what you 're doing			0
i think i have a lot more empathy for my own students , and for their learning process			0
and it 's a two - way street , in that my teaching , and what i 'm working on and what i 'm talking about in the classroom , are constantly informing the fiction as i write it			0
@entity0 : family plays a big role in the trilogy			0
how have you been able to weave that in ? @entity1 : so much fiction focuses on : " will they or wo n't they ? will our two heroes , or our hero and heroine , get together ? " that question has not ever really interested me			1
falling in love is really relatively easy , compared to staying in love and building a family that lasts			0
i always wanted to focus on that aspect of it , which i think is something that is so crucial and vital in so many ways , and so important , and so very tricky , because a lot of compromises and adjustments have to be made			0
people who get through " @entity36 " and then are looking back over the whole trilogy , are going to say : " she 's been talking about this since the very beginning			1
" these have never been two lovers just off on a date , with nobody around them who mattered			0
it 's always been about building a family and a community around themselves			0
@entity0 : how has the research process been different from your academic work ? @entity1 : the research is not that much different , but the writing is			1
when i do n't know the answers to something , and i 'm writing a work of academic non-fiction , i have to look up the answers and be really , really precise			1
and of course , if i do n't know the answer to something in fiction , i can make it up			0
there are still a lot of things i do look up if i want to get them right			0
but it is kind of a wonderfully creative thing thinking , " oh -- what if @entity167 was actually not the center of attention , but kind of a hanger - on			0
that would be fun to play with			0
" you do get to imagine yourself into places where the historical research just ca n't take you because there are no records that survive			0
for a historian , who 's normally not allowed to do that , that was also a lot of fun			0
@entity0 : what courses are you teaching ? @entity1 : in the @entity184 , i will be teaching a seminar on queens , witches and courtesans -- women and power in early @entity191			1
and the other course i 'm teaching for the very first time is public history			1
for our undergraduate majors , ( it 's about ) what do you do with your degree in history ? how can you bring your historical skills to bear on a wider community ? there is a lot of talk in the academy about the death of the humanities			2
based on my readers ' response , and their interest in history and literature and art , the death of the humanities has been grossly overstated			2
i would love for my students to take a leading role in reminding people that this stuff is important and it really matters .			0
