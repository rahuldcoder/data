-- my grandfather @entity1 shared with me many stories about the @entity5 @entity4 in 1992 and the sense of hope that surrounded it			1
i have kept a copy of the speech he made there on june 5th outlining his concerns for the future of humankind			0
the insight it provides now , on the eve of the 20th anniversary of that historic event , is particularly poignant			0
chief amongst those concerns was the issue of population , and how it directly relates to women and education			1
to be clear , my grandfather was not a proponent of draconian policies restricting birth rates or depriving people of their right to have children			2
while growing up , i heard his constant refrain that the key to solving the population crisis is to empower women			1
as he pointed out in his 1992 speech : " in all the countries with an excessive birth rate , women are segregated , deprived of appropriate health care ; the rate of illiteracy among women is one - third higher than for men			1
" my grandfather believed that when women are empowered socially , economically and given access to family planning and general education , the birth rate drops			1
he was not alone ; the rise of the micro-credit movement and the success of organizations such as the @entity56 have radically changed the way a woman 's role is viewed in communities around the world			2
see also : can @entity62 solve the world 's environmental problems ? as @entity65 , vice-president of the @entity66 pointed out during a 2011 meeting of the council : " educated women are better able to plan their families and are more aware of employment , schooling and health opportunities for themselves and their children			1
on a wider level , fewer children in a society mean that more resources are available to every individual child			0
" why do @entity1 's words continue to resonate today ? since 1992 , the global population has increased from 5.6 billion people to approximately 7 billion in 2012 , and is expected to balloon to 9.5 billion by 2050			1
like too many people packed into a vault with an ever - dwindling oxygen supply , this drastic growth still presents unprecedented problems for the global community as we continue to consume natural resources and emit pollution at a staggering rate			2
for example , just to keep pace with current population growth , it is estimated that food production will have to increase 70 % by 2050			0
the lack of access to clean , potable water is still the number one killer of children under five years of age , and the @entity5 estimates that without concrete action to solve the world 's water crisis , billions more people will lack access to clean water by the middle of the century			0
see also : @entity4 timeline add to that the effects of climate change , ocean acidification , dwindling biodiversity and collapsing global fish stocks , and the magnitude of the problem comes into dismal focus			1
now , from june 20 - 22 , 2012 , leaders from around the world will gather again in @entity123 for the @entity62 , or @entity62 as it is often called			2
there is no doubt that this conference comes at a difficult time ; a time when the world economy is in crisis and global political action is particularly halting , especially and embarrassingly in the @entity131 thanks to vitriolic partisan battles over any environmental legislation as well as the failure to enact even basic carbon - cutting initiatives			0
nevertheless i believe that there are still grounds for hope			0
because while the challenges we face are even more urgent than in 1992 , the growing chorus of voices supporting sustainable practices in the private sector , the growing prominence and respect for women in countries around the world and the general willingness to face the realities of carbon pollution are cause for cautious optimism			2
we must never stop fighting for a better world			0
as my grandfather said in his closing remarks : " i wish that at this @entity4 , heads of state and their delegates realize the urgency of drastic , unconventional decisions			1
the people of the world are anxiously awaiting a new light			0
" now , almost 20 years later , humanity stands on the edge of a knife that becomes sharper with each passing day			1
we must act boldly and courageously to build a world that realizes the simple birthright of every child ... to live in a world where they can breathe fresh air , drink clean water , and walk on green grass under a blue sky			0
the silent cries of future generations demand it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2
