-- severe rain and thunderstorms pounded the @entity4 suburbs again saturday , causing more mudslides in @entity6 and other towns			1
mandatory evacuation orders for @entity6 , @entity10 , and @entity11 remained in effect , @entity0 affiliate @entity8 reported			1
so far , no deaths have been reported			2
" we 've got people still evacuated only because we expect those thunderstorms , those high - intensity , short duration , type of rain storms , " glendora police chief @entity16 told @entity8			1
" the hillsides are already soaked right now , and it may not take much to cause those mudslides to just come down out of the hills			2
" the hills ca n't hold water because so much vegetation was destroyed in wildfires and drought			1
" these areas have the highest risk of being impacted by flooding / debris flows from rainfall due to the loss of vegetation from the foothills , " the city of @entity6 said in a statement to @entity33 , also a @entity0 affiliate			2
in @entity11 , people who choose not to leave will be asked to sign a form acknowledging they know the risk and assume liability for staying in their homes , @entity33 reported			2
the bad weather extended into @entity49 , where rain and winds felled a 50 - foot tree into an elderly woman 's home			1
she escaped out the back door and was n't injured			2
in @entity6 , stories of close calls were easily found on friday			2
@entity59 grabbed his dog and got out of the way , as a stream of water and mud came gushing on to his streets			2
since @entity67 has been in the middle of its worst drought in 100 years , it would seem that the sight of rain would be good news			1
but in @entity6 and other towns in @entity4 , it was n't			2
the rain has been much needed , but friday 's deluge -- coming down at more than an inch an hour at times -- landed on bone - dry hills scorched by recent wildfires in and around @entity4			1
with little vegetation left to stop them , walls of water have gushed into valleys below			2
they have spewed mud and debris into quiet residential streets , turning them into thick , brown creeks			2
more could hit before saturday is up , the @entity93 says			2
it has placed @entity4 and @entity96 counties under a flash flood watch			0
by the time it 's over up to 6 inches will have landed on the foothills of @entity4 and as much as 10 inches on the ridge line			0
weather weirdness the @entity105 rain is expected to end by sunday , but will move eastward over the weekend			1
it will bring cold and snow to the central plains to @entity109 late saturday and sunday and to the @entity110 by monday			1
cities that will fall in the path of the heaviest snow include @entity114 and @entity115 , @entity116 ; @entity117 and @entity118 ; and the @entity119			0
severe thunderstorms will be possible across central and eastern @entity121 and much of @entity122 on sunday			0
damaging thunderstorm winds will be the primary threat and a few tornadoes will be possible			0
several cities will experience yo - yo temperatures			0
for example , the high in @entity129 will be 71 degrees on sunday and drop to 54 on monday			1
in @entity132 , it will be 40 on sunday and 26 on monday ; in @entity119 , 54 and 34 , with a chance of 8 - 10 inches of snow			1
in @entity136 , one person was killed and 20 were injured after a series of wrecks saturday that involved an estimated 60 cars , @entity140 , public information officer for the @entity142 , told @entity0			0
@entity140 said there were three different accident scenes within a short stretch of @entity146 , the first of which involved 45 cars			0
the storms brought the first rains since a powerful , persistent weather system collapsed that was keeping @entity67 parched			1
the same system was also at the root of a lot of strange weather around the globe -- all the way to @entity160			1
a massive , sturdy ridge of high - pressure air had hovered over @entity67 , blustering rain clouds away			1
at the same time , it pushed the jet - stream way up into @entity166 and distorted it , said weather environmentalist @entity167			1
the stream then whipped south , pulling icy cold down into the @entity170 , where it triggered snow storms			1
then it dragged them up to @entity175 , before crossing the @entity176 and bringing floods to @entity178			0
it is also brought the unseasonably warm weather at the @entity181 in @entity182 , @entity167 said			1
the heavy @entity67 rains will not do much to alleviate the drought , according to the @entity185			1
a lot of the water is flowing right back out to sea , and the drought 's effects have been enormous			1
water reservoirs are running at minimum levels			0
for the first time in its history , the @entity193 - a system of canals and reservoirs that provide water to two thirds of the people in the state 's @entity200 -- set its allocation for all of them to zero			1
fire , then water floating in @entity6 's silt were chunks of burned wood			0
just weeks ago , flames were consuming the hills looming above them			0
now , 1,000 homes in the valley have been ordered to evacuate , for fear of flash floods			0
besides his dog , @entity59 left almost everything he owns behind to face the sludge			0
" i got my laptop , " he said			0
" it 's going to be fine			0
" it was probably quick thinking on his part			0
the rising waters caught many off guard			0
" it was n't like this 20 minutes ago , " said resident @entity229			0
he seemed aghast , as he watched a stream of thick brown pour down a street			0
@entity0 's @entity234 contributed to this report			0
