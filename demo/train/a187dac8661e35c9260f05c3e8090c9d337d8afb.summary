-- the company paid to treat people to free newspapers in @entity4 , lighted the @entity5 in @entity7 ' colors and draped @entity9 's @entity8 with a 300 - foot banner -- all part of a massive $ 300 million ad campaign that accompanied the product 's arrival			1
@entity7 95 , which was separate from the company 's business - oriented @entity16 product , added a number of features over its predecessors including better network support , the ability to send faxes ( yes , there was a time when that was a big deal ) along with basic audio recording , audio playback , and video playback tools			1
features now thought of as core parts of @entity7 , such as the start menu and taskbar , also made their debut with @entity35			1
plus , it just looked a whole lot better graphically and was far more stable than past consumer versions of @entity7			1
@entity39 debuted around the same time , but was sold separately as part of @entity42 's @entity41			0
it was eventually bundled in directly with the operating system in an update to @entity35 released the following year			1
by the time @entity35 was finally ushered off the market in 2001 , it had become a fixture on computer desktops around the world			2
" if you look at @entity35 , it was a quantum leap in difference in technological capability and stability , " @entity53 analyst @entity52 said at that time			2
a decade and a half after @entity35 hit the market , though , one question looms large for @entity7 : are all its best days in the past ? clearly it was a different time and @entity42 might be hard pressed to capture that kind of consumer attention no matter what it did			1
but , never mind the long lines , will @entity42 be able to continue to sell @entity7 at the price and volume it has ? it 's one of the most important questions facing @entity42 as a company			1
while the company has expanded far beyond its @entity7 roots , @entity7 and @entity76 remain the engine driving the vast majority of the company 's profits even as it looks to cell phones , search , and online services to augment its mainstay businesses			1
at the moment , the @entity7 business is doing quite well , with @entity88 selling at an impressive clip			2
indeed @entity88 is selling far faster than @entity35 did in its early days , though that 's as much a testament to how large the pc market is as anything else			1
the longer - term question is whether @entity7 can outpace what i call the generic web experience			1
in the coming years , smartbooks , tablets , cell phones , netbooks and shapes we probably have n't thought of will all be capable of delivering the web , which is for many people their main use of a pc			0
for @entity7 to be as relevant on @entity35 's 20th anniversary as it is today , the company will have had to manage to evolve the operating system significantly			1
i see a few ways this can happen , but none is a sure thing			0
first , @entity42 ( or a third - party software maker ) can develop a new killer app that only runs on @entity7			2
it 's been a long time since this happened , but certainly it 's not impossible			0
new user interfaces can also be added			0
touch is already there , as is voice control to some degree , but gesture recognition such as that found in @entity125 could pave the way for new uses			0
second , it could evolve @entity7 and @entity129 to offer a dramatically better way of doing the same tasks that most people do on the @entity133			2
sure , we can manage our photos and music on the @entity133 today and that is getting easier			0
however , tapping local storage and graphics , @entity42 has the potential to offer a better way and , with the latest version of @entity129 , is trying to do so			0
third , @entity42 could enhance the value of @entity7 by having a browser that is demonstrably superior to @entity146 rivals			2
this appears to be a tall order , given that @entity39 , while still leading in market share , has been well behind rivals when it comes to being seen as the technical leader			0
for the record , this challenge is not just the one facing @entity42			0
it 's also the one facing @entity157 's @entity156 business			0
and while @entity42 must justify the $ 100 or so premium that it charges for @entity7 , @entity157 commands an even higher premium when comparing the @entity156 to one of these " generic web " devices			1
but @entity157 also has another entrant in the game -- a viable alternative web experience delivered in the form of the @entity167			1
@entity42 , at least so far , appears to have only @entity7 , in its various flavors			0
