@entity0 -- the @entity3 banks need to better prevent conflicts of interest , according to a new government report that highlights transparency issues with financial executives serving on the banks ' boards			1
all 12 reserve banks should more " clearly document the roles and responsibilities of the ( board ) directors , " according to a @entity17 ( @entity17 ) audit released wednesday			1
the report focuses on scenarios in which executives pose apparent conflicts of interest by serving on boards that regulate financial houses where they also have business relationships			1
an example , it notes , occurred when then - chairman of the @entity31 's board of directors @entity32 owned shares in the investment firm @entity34 , but in september 2008 provided it and other banks billions of dollars in federal funding in response to the unfolding financial crisis			1
@entity32 was granted a waiver by the @entity42 in january 2009 , the report said			2
but the board was unaware that he had purchased additional shares in @entity34 through an automatic stock purchase program			0
the former chairman , who resigned in may 2009 , could not be immediately reached for comment			0
the @entity17 , meanwhile , said that " without more public disclosure of governance arrangements , such as board of director bylaws and director eligibility and ethics policies , there may be continued concerns about @entity58 governance and the integrity of the @entity3			1
" it did not identify actual conflicts of interest			2
however , it indicated the appearance of a conflict could cast broader concerns about the health of the overall reserve bank system			0
the @entity17 is the investigative arm of @entity68 charged with examining matters relating to the receipt and payment of public funds			0
sen. @entity73 , a @entity74 , said the agency 's findings point to " exactly the kind of outrageous behavior by the big banks and @entity80 that is infuriating so many @entity81			0
" " the most powerful entity in the @entity81 is riddled with conflicts of interest , " he said in a written statement			2
despite government regulatory efforts , wednesday 's audit says directors with affiliations and business relationships with banks " continue to pose reputational risks to the @entity3			1
" the report also called for reserve boards to boost diversity levels by broadening their candidate pool			1
" specifically , in 2010 @entity58 directors included 78 white men , 15 white women , 12 minority men , and 3 minority women , " it noted			0
the @entity42 said in a response included in the report that the recommendations " all have merit " and it " will work to implement them			0
" the audit was conducted as a result of a mandate by the @entity113 - @entity112 , an 848 - page bill meant to root out causes of the 2008 financial crisis .			0
