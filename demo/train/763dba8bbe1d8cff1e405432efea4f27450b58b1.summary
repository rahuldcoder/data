@entity0 -- a @entity4 employee was found guilty monday of four terror - related charges , including plotting to blow up an airplane , a court in @entity0 said			1
@entity7 , 31 , worked as a software engineer for @entity4 in the northern @entity10 city of @entity11			2
he used his position to pass on information to @entity17 's affiliate in @entity18 , including to @entity20 - born radical cleric @entity19 , jurors in the four - week - long trial in @entity0 were told			1
@entity7 , who was arrested last year , admitted offering himself for terrorist operations , making a jihadi recruitment video and fundraising for terrorism , but denied knowing that information he gave @entity19 would be used for terrorism			1
prosecutors said he passed on information that would have been useful for terrorists plotting to blow up a plane and also information that could have been used to help plan a " disruptive " cyber attack on @entity4			2
@entity30 is thought to be hiding out in @entity18 , and was recently described by @entity20 president @entity32 's counterterror chief , @entity31 , as posing a bigger threat to the @entity20 homeland than @entity35			1
a key part of the prosecution case was a series of heavily encrypted messages between @entity19 and @entity7 , in which @entity19 pressed for information about @entity7 's job and his knowledge of airport security			1
" i pray that @entity48 may grant us a breakthrough through you ... can you please specify your role in the airline industry , how much access do you have to airports , what information do you have on the limitations and cracks in present airport security systems ? " @entity7 replied : " the kuffar ( a derogatory term for @entity60 ) are planning to install full body scanners across @entity63 airports			2
this allows them to see things under clothes			0
" but he warned @entity19 to be realistic : " you are probably hoping that i work at the airport , but the fact is i do n't			0
i personally know two brothers , one who works in baggage handling at @entity73 and another who works in airport security			0
both are good practising brothers and sympathize towards the cause of the mujahedeen			0
" replying , @entity19 got straight to the point : " our highest priority is the @entity20 anything there , even on a smaller scale compared to what we may do in the @entity63 , would be our choice			1
so the question is : with the people you have is it possible to get a package or person with a package on board a flight heading to the @entity20 ? " @entity7 , who was born in @entity96 and is now a @entity63 citizen , had been in the @entity63 three years at that point , prosecutor @entity95 said			1
@entity1 terrorism analyst @entity99 said this communication confirmed what @entity20 intelligence officials had been saying for some time : " this trial has presented @entity19 not only as the charismatic driving force behind @entity106 but also a key operational figure in the group , a guy who is orchestrating plots against the @entity111			1
" the exchange of messages took place in january 2010 and february 2010 , just weeks after @entity106 was blamed for a failed bomb attack on a @entity117 transatlantic flight from @entity118 to @entity119			0
@entity120 , a 23 - year - old @entity121 man , had trained with @entity106 in @entity18 before attempting to detonate explosives sewn into his underpants , according to @entity20 officials			2
@entity106 has also been widely blamed by western intelligence officials for twin foiled attacks on cargo aircraft last october			0
one device , hidden in a printer cartridge and described as " viable " by @entity63 officials , was uncovered on a @entity132 plane after it landed at @entity134 airport in the @entity63			0
the other -- also hidden in a printer cartridge - was found on a @entity138 plane at @entity133			0
@entity63 investigators say they have no evidence that links @entity7 to either of these plots			0
they describe him as " dedicated to the terrorist cause , " though they say there was no imminent danger of him launching an attack himself			0
police have also refused to say where the original tip - off about @entity7 came from , saying only , " we had some information that made him of interest to us			2
" @entity7 is due to be sentenced march 18 .			1
