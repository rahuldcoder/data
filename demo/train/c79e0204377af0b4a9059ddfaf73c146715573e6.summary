the @entity0 is negotiating a deal with the league to award $ 100 million to @entity3 over 10 years to study and treat players ' injuries and illnesses , according to a proposal obtained by @entity8			1
in the last few years , the perception of a typical @entity11 player has undergone a subtle shift : from lithe titans performing formidable feats on the field to men who may end their careers broken down , their brains addled by a mysterious concussion - related brain disease			1
but the real picture of the typical @entity11 player is much more complex , and the health problems run much deeper than concussion			1
according to the proposal , the funding would be used to " diagnose , treat and prevent " players ' injuries and illnesses			1
" no one has ever studied these players before , " said dr. @entity27 , dean for clinical and translational research at @entity29 and co-director of the proposed study			1
" there have been postmortem studies looking at the brains of previous players but not the players today			2
" @entity27 said that what distinguishes this study is that it will look at the " whole player across his whole life , not just the brain			2
" the @entity11 said it looked forward to learning more about the study and hopes " it will play an important role in advancing medical science			1
" " we have no higher priority than player health and safety at all levels of the game , " it said in a statement			2
seau had neurodegenerative brain disease , @entity55 finds it is not just the brain that may be damaged after a long career on the playing field			2
by the end of their careers , @entity11 players may emerge with all sorts of injuries -- chronic pain , arthritis , joints needing replacement , depression , diabetes , heart problems and concussion - related dementia , among others -- so many they have become a cohort ripe for study			1
" every player understands the risks associated with playing football , " said @entity78 , a tight end with the @entity79 , in a statement			2
" what we 're trying to do as players through this research is to find ways to lead healthier lives			2
it 's the most important thing we can do off the field			0
" the proposed research project will be announced at the @entity0 annual @entity94 press conference on thursday in @entity95			0
members of the @entity0 say the proposed research is unprecedented in both scope and resources , at least as it relates to @entity11 player health			1
if the @entity0 successfully forges this agreement with the @entity11 , the funding would dwarf a $ 30 million donation made to the @entity55 by the @entity11 last year			1
that study has a more specific focus on brain injury			2
" we have seen the condition of our players five , 10 , 15 , 20 years after they play , " said @entity107 , a spokesman for the @entity0			2
" given the scope of health issues that @entity11 players are subject to , we are committed to making sure that enough money is allocated to get answers			1
" @entity107 added , " if this was strictly a concussion research program , the right number might not have been $ 100 million			0
it would have been much less			0
" scan may detect signs of @entity11 players ' brain disease the @entity3 proposal focuses on studying a core group of 100 unhealthy players -- both current and retired -- and 100 healthy players			1
those two groups will be drawn from an initial larger study group of 1,000 current and former players from across the @entity129			1
they will have played diverse positions and will have experienced diverse health problems			0
the initial group of 1,000 will participate in a series of baseline studies including cardiac function , testing for joint abnormalities and psychosocial tests			0
the players will also submit exhaustive playing and injury histories , spanning their entire football careers			1
from those preliminary data will emerge the 100 healthiest and least healthy players , who will then continue testing at @entity3 over several years			0
@entity27 said the focus will be on cross-institutional collaboration , with hundreds of scientists at @entity3 potentially playing roles in the study			0
" when you 're talking about @entity11 players , you 're talking about people in the 99.99 % of unusual , " said @entity27			1
" these are superathletes who have skills that very few people have , and when you put them in extremely emotional and physical situations , those psychosocial stresses and physical stresses integrate			0
" questions linger about long - term impact of subtle hits to head how those stresses coalesce and take shape over the course of long careers playing football is what @entity3 researchers , and partners from other institutions , will be trying to pinpoint			1
" typically , when we do a test or medical study , we 're taking a snapshot , " said dr. @entity173 , principal investigator of the @entity174 at the @entity175 and one of the scientists enlisted from outside @entity3			0
" what we want to do is see the full - length movie of what happens to a player over time			0
" how is it that two men that play the same position for the same number of years have vastly different lives after playing ? not everyone suffers from the same types of problems , and not everything can be explained by simple repetitive traumas			0
" ideas floated for study include using advanced scanning techniques and genetics to fuel knowledge about who is most at risk for head injury , finding ways to regrow knee ligaments in a lab , identifying injury prevention strategies such as new drugs or new helmets , and addressing ethical issues surrounding player injuries			1
" one of the broader aims of the research is conflicts of interest when you have a patient who will do anything to get back on the field and a doctor who works for and is paid by a club , " said @entity212 , @entity0 staff counsel			0
the holistic focus of the research does not obviate the importance of concussion , said @entity212			0
work on concussion will be a major focus , " but there are a lot of unique issues that our guys face within a unique context ... other ailments and diagnoses that are prevalent in the football population			2
" funding for the study will come from the players ' portion of league revenues , currently being negotiated between the @entity11 and the @entity0			1
the exact figure to be allocated for the study is still to be determined , according to @entity107 , and most likely will not be finalized until after the @entity94			0
the absence of a finalized plan has not stopped the @entity0 from imagining what a successful study could mean , not just for @entity11 players but for athletes in other sports			1
" if this $ 100 million of research would have caused a groundbreaking discovery in one critical area of a player 's life or health , then we would have succeeded , " said @entity107			0
" whether it 's an @entity261 issue or a mental health issue or a concussion issue , if we find one solution to any of those things we 're studying , it would have been a success			0
" ex-nfl stars after concussion : lives unraveled			0

@entity270 negotiating with @entity11 to fund the study
it will look at variety of health issues faced by pro football players
proposal is to study long - term health of 200 players
