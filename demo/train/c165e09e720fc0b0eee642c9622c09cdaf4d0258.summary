-- @entity1 told herself not to cry as police handcuffed her outside the @entity3			1
" i knew i was doing the right thing , " she said			0
" so i did not cry			0
" on a cloudy day last month @entity1 , a former member of the @entity5 , took a huge career risk and joined more than 1,200 protesters who were demanding that president @entity8 deny a building permit for @entity10 , a planned oil pipeline that would stretch from @entity11 , @entity12 , to @entity13			1
the project , the protesters say , threatens to poison ground water across the heartland and extend @entity19 's reliance on climate - changing fossil fuels			0
pipeline owners , @entity11 - based @entity23 , say the project will pose no ground water risk and will provide jobs and decreased @entity19 dependence on @entity29 oil			1
a final decision on the permit is expected by the end of this year			0
since the pipeline was first proposed , @entity8 has said the decision rests with the @entity35 , but @entity1 and others point out that the president has the power to make the final call			1
@entity1 , 32 , worked as a grassroots student organizer			0
she joined @entity8 's campaign in 2007 , rising to a position of @entity44 's youth vote director			1
for her and many other participants , the protest outside the @entity3 represented a deeply personal threshold they 'd never before crossed : " it was the first time i 'd ever remotely said anything critical of the president , " she said			1
many other @entity8 supporters have found themselves critical of the president 's environmental policies			1
a big reason why @entity1 and other environmentalists , including former vice president @entity57 , find themselves aligned against @entity8 goes back to his 2008 nomination speech when he pledged to fight the affects of climate change			1
" i am absolutely certain that generations from now , we will be able to look back and tell our children that ... this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal , " @entity8 said during the speech			1
" that 's great poetry , but it 's not true anymore , " says @entity71 , who served as acting assistant secretary of energy during the @entity74 administration			2
" there 's no question there 's been a shift in what he campaigned on and what he has done -- most specifically in the area of climate change , but in other areas like air pollution			0
" what @entity8 could do to help slow the rise of the oceans it 's a tough political climate for supporters of clean energy alternatives , such as solar or wind power			1
almost every issue in @entity98 -- including the environment -- is overshadowed by concerns about the struggling economy and unemployment			1
fossil fuel industries , blamed by many for climate change , are creating jobs and bolstering economies in the heartland and the @entity109			0
" we still are suffering from a lack of an energy policy that can deal both with our environmental challenges , but also our economic challenges , " @entity8 said during a @entity111 event last month			1
@entity118 , a 30 - year - old welder in @entity119 , @entity120 , understands the challenge , and he has a lot riding on the @entity3 's decision about the pipeline			1
" i want to see oil production , but i do care about the environment and i think there 's a lot of ways we can work both of them together , " said @entity118 , who is between jobs and with his wife @entity126 is raising two boys , @entity128 , 9 and @entity129 , age 6			1
the country has been burning oil for a long time , he said , " and it ai n't going to change overnight			2
" he 's very confident that he 'll be able to snag a job on the project if it 's green - lighted			0
" financially , what a job on the @entity10 pipeline would do for me is get me out of more debt and help me lower my monthly bills , " says @entity118 , a third - generation pipe - liner who 's been welding since age 18			0
environmentalists say @entity8 reneges on promises environmentalists were incensed last month when @entity8 decided to delay tougher ozone air pollution standards until at least 2013			1
the president 's decision threatens the health of children , the elderly and victims of chronic lung diseases , the @entity155 said			0
some of the president 's supporters reacted harshly to the ozone standards decision , @entity57 who posted on his blog that " @entity8 appears to have bowed to pressure from polluters " who fear the cost of following tougher air pollution standards			2
@entity172 of the @entity173 -- which endorsed @entity8 in 2008 -- said the administration was " caving " to industry and the president 's decision was a choice to " punt			2
" former @entity8 campaign staffer @entity179 , who also was arrested at the protest at the @entity3 , said the president is " missing an opportunity to lead this country in a better direction			1
" the @entity3 insisted the delay was n't political , but rather a need for further scientific study before implementing new rules , which would have cost 7.3 million jobs by 2020 , said the @entity190			2
the @entity191 told the @entity192 that the @entity3 is " beginning to understand that the regulatory burden does more to chill job creation than just about anything else out there			2
" the @entity3 declined to directly respond to specific questions about @entity8 's environmental stance , but spokesman @entity199 , in a written statement for this story , strongly defended the president 's record			1
" in just a few years the @entity8 administration has put in place some of the most important public health protections since the passage of the @entity208 , achieved historic fuel economy standards that will save billions of barrels of oil and over a trillion dollars for families , while also expanding the clean energy economy , creating jobs , keeping @entity19 competitive , and putting our country on track to double renewable energy generation from sources like wind and solar in the president 's first term , " @entity199 wrote			1
will the pipeline create jobs ? building the pipeline will directly create 13,000 construction jobs and indirectly generate 7,000 construction jobs , according to @entity229 of the @entity230 , which @entity23 hired to provide an economic analysis of the project			0
imagine 1,500 well - paid workers coming into any community and spending their money at stores , restaurants , motels , trailer parks and apartments , says @entity241 of the @entity242 local 798 out of @entity243 , @entity244			0
" it 's like the circus coming to town -- but they stay , " @entity241 said			0
but pipeline and community officials agree the project will leave very few permanent jobs			0
the lasting benefit from @entity10 , says @entity23 spokesman @entity255 , would be greater economic stability in the @entity19 energy sector by providing a reliable flow of about 1.1 million daily barrels of @entity12 and @entity19 oil to @entity13 refineries			2
an onshore pipeline would be less likely to be interrupted by hurricanes than oil delivered by oil tankers or from offshore oil rigs , @entity255 said			2
" that keeps thousands of workers at those refineries employed			0
" does clean energy kill jobs ? the @entity230 estimates that some $ 5 billion of the pipeline 's $ 7 billion total price would be spent on direct construction costs , such as materials and labor			1
that $ 5 billion -- if invested in clean energy production such as wind or solar power -- would generate slightly more jobs , says economist @entity282 of @entity283 and the @entity284 , an influential liberal think tank			1
solar panel maker @entity285 went bankrupt last month despite receiving about a half billion dollars in federal loan guarantees initiated by the administration			0
a top energy official with the program has resigned in the wake of criticism			0
ex-staffer : @entity8 needs to be ' the guy that he was ' so now , the green movement is putting the @entity3 on notice			1
the next three to six months present a " very critical time " for the relationship between @entity8 and environmentalists , says @entity173 ' @entity172			1
many of @entity1 's former colleagues she met during the ' 08 @entity8 campaign say they 're frustrated by the @entity3 environmental track record so far			1
" there is an element of feeling something owed , " she says			0
" he made a promise			2
this was a big promise that he talked a lot about			0
and now he risks letting them down			0
" the green community , advocates say , will be watching			2
along with the pipeline , three other looming questions could serve as tests for the president 's commitment to the environment			2
-- how hard will @entity8 fight in @entity321 for proposed @entity323 rules to regulate mercury and other toxic pollution from power plants ? -- will @entity8 consistently stand up and block efforts in @entity321 to limit the @entity323 's authority ? -- how hard will @entity8 fight to establish the @entity323 's first - ever standards for greenhouse gas emissions from power plants ? but the giant green issue for many will be the pipeline			1
" it 's going to influence a lot of people , " says @entity71			0
" the cumulative weight of all these decisions will			0
" @entity340 , a top organizer of the @entity3 sit - in , calls it " gut check time " for the president			2
" it 's time for him to do some heroic things on the environment			0
" as @entity354 campaign staffer @entity179 put it , " if he 's going to win the election , i think he needs to get back to that guy that he was			0
