-- @entity2 @entity1 climbs into the cockpit of his @entity4			1
he straps on his helmet and slides his hands into his gloves			0
in his mind he prepares to go fast -- very fast			0
over the next two minutes he will navigate a hair - raising track , grappling for control of his " @entity11 " at speeds in excess of 90 mph as his body strains and contorts			0
but @entity1 is not behind the wheel of a @entity18 car and perhaps even more disconcertingly there 's no safety belt to restrain him should things go awry			0
instead he is at the front end of a bobsled and the driver for the @entity2 team heading to the @entity26			1
the bobsled @entity1 and compatriots will pilot is the latest product of collaboration between the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) and the country 's legendary automotive manufacturer , who are providing design input to hopefully deliver medal success in @entity36 in next year 's @entity37			1
" the idea was to share the knowledge between our institute and @entity4 to try to improve all the sports where technology plays a big part in the results , " @entity30 deputy general secretary @entity38 told @entity0			1
" the first option was to start with something that was very similar to the cars , to @entity18 and i think , in the world of sport , the bobsled was the first option			0
" @entity4 is synonymous with high performance , from its sleek , stylish road cars to the @entity18 machines which have made it the most the most successful constructor in the sport 's history			2
@entity30 's partnership with @entity4 dates back to 2006 , with a @entity64 - designed sled taking to the track at the @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68			1
two years later at the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity4 's two - man sled was piloted to gold by @entity74 and @entity75			1
now @entity1 will bid to replicate his younger countrymen 's success by guiding his sled to the top of the podium in february			0
" @entity4 has listened to our advice to the letter , studying every little detail and @entity30 has played a crucial role in coordination , " @entity1 said in a statement released by the @entity30 earlier this month			1
@entity18 and bobsled are sports where thousandths of a second can be the difference between success and failure , small margins within which @entity4 's team of engineers are used to operating			1
" we have selected from our @entity18 team and our road cars department some engineers who have achieved some brilliant results in @entity18 and were looking for new opportunities within the company , " explained @entity4 engineer @entity99			2
" after that we set up a brand new team , defined a new area and put this team to work on this new program			0
" clearly a new team is a new challenge , but it seems that results are coming , so we succeed			0
" @entity30 is not the only @entity115 committee looking to motorsport for a competitive edge			2
the @entity118 team will be riding a sled developed in conjunction with @entity121 , while the @entity122 will be piloting a @entity124 - crafted sled at the newly - built @entity126 sliding center			0
but @entity4 's involvement with @entity30 does n't end with bobsled			1
other winter disciplines such as skiing have benefited from wind tunnel testing and @entity4 's knowledge of aerodynamics , as well as @entity135 sports such as archery , rowing , canoeing and kayaking			2
@entity4 's work in all of those events involves helping an object move through the air , water or snow with minimal drag , which is where aerodynamics engineer @entity146 comes in			2
" at the moment our aerodynamic approach is based on wind tunnel tests and numerical simulation based on commutation of fluid dynamics , " explained @entity147			0
" this is the most important approach because every tool has its strengths and weaknesses and the integrated approach is telling us how to achieve the best possible results			0
" if @entity147 and his team get in right , then there should be nothing but clear air between the @entity2 team and @entity115 gold in @entity36 .			1

@entity2 will ride a @entity4 - designed bobsled at the 2012 @entity26
@entity30 has been partnered with @entity4 since 2006
a @entity4 bobsled won gold for @entity2 at the 2010 @entity173
