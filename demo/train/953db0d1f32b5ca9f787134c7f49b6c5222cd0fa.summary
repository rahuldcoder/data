@entity0 -- president @entity2 takes his first stab wednesday night at the role of fundraiser in chief			1
president @entity2 raised lots of money as he campaigned , but how will he do now that the election is over ? the president is the main attraction at two events in the nation 's capital for the @entity15 , making for the first fundraising test for @entity2 since he took over the presidency two months ago			1
as a candidate for the @entity19 , @entity2 , who was then a senator from @entity21 , had little trouble raising money : he broke all fundraising records , raking in nearly $ 750 million during his two - year campaign for the presidency			1
the money raised at wednesday night 's two events -- at the @entity30 and the @entity31 , where singer @entity32 is scheduled to perform -- will come in handy as the @entity15 struggles to keep pace with its @entity35 counterpart			1
@entity36 won back the @entity19 and increased their majorities in @entity38 in november 's elections , but when it comes to campaign cash , the national party is not having the same kind of success			0
the @entity15 raised about $ 3.3 million last month , while the @entity45 raked in more than $ 5 million			2
thanks to a larger transfer of campaign cash left over from @entity2 's presidential run , the @entity15 was able to report $ 5.4 million in total contributions last month , slightly edging out the @entity45			1
but when it comes to cash on hand -- the amount of money the parties have in the bank -- the @entity15 's $ 8.5 million trails the @entity45 's $ 24 million			1
@entity15 chairman @entity59 on tuesday dismissed the committee 's disappointing february cash haul , saying that his fundraising efforts were handicapped by a @entity64 law that prohibits officials from raising money during the state 's legislative session			1
" fundraising stories do n't interest me that much , " @entity59 said , according to the @entity69			2
" i was unable to raise any money in february , by law			0
" @entity59 , who is @entity15 chairman while finishing out his term as @entity64 's governor , wrapped up work with the state 's @entity77 on february 28			1
" that is the reason that the numbers are n't going to be what they 're going to be in future months , " said @entity59 , who became @entity15 chairman in late january			1
@entity59 said that observers should " stay tuned " now that he 's free to solicit donations			1
" historically , the @entity35 has almost always out - raised the @entity36 , regardless of who sat in the @entity85			0
it was n't until the 2004 cycle that the @entity15 was able to barely out - raise the @entity45			2
so the fact that @entity36 have n't brought in as much this year as the @entity35 is n't necessarily a huge surprise , " said @entity88 , the @entity89 's research director			0
the president 's appearances at the fundraisers come on the same day he spent some political capital , for the first time since taking over the @entity19 , in an effort to get another @entity98 elected			0
@entity2 e-mailed @entity99 @entity36 endorsing @entity100 , the venture capitalist who is running in the special election to fill the seat in @entity99 's 20th @entity103 that was vacated by @entity104 when she was appointed to the @entity105 in january			2
@entity100 's @entity35 opponent in next tuesday 's election is is @entity99 assemblyman @entity108			0
though the @entity15 and @entity35 campaign committees in the @entity111 have pumped resources into the race , the president had so far kept his distance			2
in fact , the president has largely avoided overtly political events since his inauguration two months ago			0
last week , that began to change : he sent a video to millions of his supporters through the e-mail distribution list of @entity124 , the remnant of his presidential campaign that is now under the umbrella of the @entity15			0
with @entity36 hoping to defend two governorships this november , the party hopes that the president will be able to bring in the big bucks			0
" controlling the @entity19 is still a big plus when it comes to fundraising			0
in the last midterms , president @entity135 raised at least $ 170 million on behalf of @entity35 candidates and party committees , even while his personal approval ratings were relatively low , " @entity88 said			0
" so there 's no doubt that president @entity2 can give the party a huge fundraising boost if he hits the campaign trail and stumps for other @entity36			2

@entity2 broke fundraising records during *general* election
he is appearing at two fundraising events for the @entity15 on wednesday night
