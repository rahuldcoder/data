-- " @entity2 " and flimsy evidence led to guilty verdicts in the nation 's oldest cold case ever solved , according to the man serving a life sentence for kidnapping and murdering a neighbor 's child in 1957			1
in his 80 - page appeal , former police officer @entity11 says he deserves a new trial because his mother was allowed to accuse him from the grave -- while he was kept from proving that he was elsewhere when a 7 - year - old girl was abducted and killed			1
the appellate brief , filed thursday by the @entity20 state appellate defender , noted that nobody saw who grabbed @entity11 from a street corner in @entity24 , @entity20 , or witnessed how or where she was killed			1
no forensic evidence ties @entity27 -- or anyone else -- to a crime so shocking it captured the attention of fbi director @entity31 , the appeal states			2
instead , the court papers say , prosecutors built their case on unreliable evidence , including inmate witnesses whose motives were suspect and others whose memories were dulled by the passage of time : " the evidence against @entity11 , " the appeal contended , " was so unreasonable , so improbable , and so unsatisfactory as to create a reasonable doubt that he was responsible for a 1957 murder , kidnapping , and abduction of an infant			1
" that evidence included " personal memories of what occurred 55 years ago ; a photo identification made 53 years after the incident ; testimony from jailhouse informants ; innocuous statements from the defendant ; and an improperly admitted and inconclusive statement from the defendant 's mother while on morphine and @entity64 just before her death			1
" the appeal cited many of the issues raised by legal experts who spoke with @entity0 for " taken : the coldest case ever solved , " a five - part multimedia series published in august			1
the series was the basis for an hour - long documentary that aired on @entity75			2
read the appeal ( @entity77 ) @entity27 was convicted in september 2012 of kidnapping and murdering @entity11 55 years earlier			1
the brown - eyed second - grader vanished from the corner of @entity24 's @entity81 and @entity82 on the evening of december 3 , 1957			1
her body was found the following spring in a grove of trees off a busy state highway about 120 miles away			0
the crime , which shook the small farming community to its core , is believed to be the country 's oldest cold case ever prosecuted			1
now 74 , @entity27 is serving a life sentence at a state prison in @entity94 , @entity20			2
he denied committing the crime in several letters to @entity0 and in a jailhouse interview last year			1
he also denied having anything to do with @entity101 's disappearance and death in a lengthy police interrogation in @entity104 hours before his arrest			1
prosecutors and investigators said his odd demeanor during questioning convinced them they had the right man			2
the @entity112 state 's attorney , which prosecuted @entity27 , declined comment and referred calls to the @entity20 state appellate prosecutor , which also declined to comment on a pending case			1
a court clerk said both sides should finish filing their briefs by late june and arguments could be scheduled by summer			0
" i think the problem with @entity126 's trial is , it was all emotion - based , " said @entity122 , @entity27 's stepdaughter and most outspoken defender			0
she said she hopes his lawyers can convince the appeals court to view the case with a more objective eye			1
" to find a man guilty based on conflicting stories , unconstitutional rulings and emotion and not allow @entity126 the chance to present the evidence that cleared his name in 1957 goes against our constitutional rights , " she said			1
testimony lasted little more than a week at @entity27 's trial , which was decided by a judge brought in from a neighboring county			0
for the most part , the appeal focused on judge @entity149 's pretrial rulings regarding what evidence to allow and what evidence to exclude			1
@entity149 used an exception to the hearsay rule to let @entity27 's sisters testify about a deathbed statement by their mother but excluded as hearsay police and @entity159 reports from the 1957 kidnapping investigation			1
he also excluded a @entity24 police detective 's investigation during the mid- 1990s that concluded that another man , now deceased , committed the crime			1
" in a court with murder charges at issue , the law demands more than nostalgia , " state appellate defender @entity166 wrote			0
" it demands proof beyond a reasonable doubt			0
" @entity166 did not represent @entity27 at his trial ; he was appointed by the state to handle his appeal			0
the appeal noted that prosecutors " took great effort to describe the gentle , small - town nature of @entity24 , @entity20 , in 1957			2
" it was a time and place where the abduction and murder of a child playing in the season 's first snow " was a shocking , defining and tragic event , " the appeal said , but criminal responsibility for kidnapping , child abduction and murder " needed to be proven to competent evidence			1
" in this case , the appeal stated , the evidence presented against @entity27 " woefully failed to rise to the level of proof necessary to sustain his conviction			2
" the appeal criticized @entity149 's rulings as a " gross abuse of discretion " that prevented @entity27 from receiving a fair trial			1
@entity149 declined to comment on the case , citing @entity20 ' code of judicial conduct			0
@entity27 's appellate lawyers focused their attack on a hospital bed accusation by his sedated , dying mother that prompted @entity216 to reopen their investigation			1
the defense has long argued that it should never have been disclosed in court			0
@entity27 's sisters testified that their mother told them " @entity222 did it " or " he did it " but gave contradicting testimony on what she meant by " it			2
" @entity229 , who was in the end stages of cancer , was sedated , " emotionally disturbed , " sometimes " basically comatose " and at other times " pleasantly confused , " the testimony showed			0
prosecutors persuaded @entity149 to allow the statement under a hearsay exception , arguing that @entity229 could have faced obstruction of justice charges herself for covering up for her son all those years			0
but the appellate lawyers countered that criminal charges were n't a realistic possibility for a terminally ill woman			0
" instead the statement was an out - of - court accusation , " the appeal stated , " the admission of which should have been strictly forbidden			2
" @entity248 was the prosecution 's star witness and the last person to see @entity101 alive , besides the killer			0
@entity248 , who was 8 at the time her friend vanished , was shown hundreds if not thousands of photographs as a child but did n't identify the stranger who called himself " @entity257 " until 53 years after the crime			0
she was in her 60s and living in a neighboring city when an @entity216 detective knocked on her door and showed her a group of photographs			0
she picked one she had not seen before -- a recropped prom photo showing 17 - year - old @entity11 , as @entity27 was then known -- and identified him as the young man who gave @entity101 a piggyback ride minutes before she vanished			1
she also identified the photograph in court , but the appeal asserts that the appearance of the man in the photo differs from the description she gave in court of the man she saw on the street corner			2
three jailhouse informants testified about conversations they said they had with @entity27 while he was awaiting trial			0
they gave varying accounts of how he described killing her : with a wire , strangling her with his hands or dropping her on her head			0
the informants and several police detectives from @entity104 , where @entity27 was initially questioned and arrested , also testified about odd statements he made about @entity11			2
they said he described her as " lovely , " with big brown eyes and " like a little @entity297 doll			0
" while the appeal referred to those statements and vivid descriptions of a little girl he knew 50 years ago as " innocuous , " others have described them as unsettling , even " creepy			0
" given the circumstantial nature of the prosecution 's case , the appeal asserted , the defense should have been able to expect some leeway			1
but , court papers say , the judge 's pretrial rulings prevented @entity27 from presenting his defense			2
he was unable to call a witness , former @entity24 police detective @entity315 , who concluded during the mid- 1990s that another man committed the crime			0
and he was not permitted to present police and @entity159 reports from the 1957 kidnapping investigation that indicated he was questioned and cleared from the list of suspects because he had an alibi			1
the reports indicated that @entity27 spoke with military recruiters in @entity327 , about 40 miles away , about the time @entity101 was taken from the street corner in @entity24			0
they also seemed to verify his story that he made a collect call home , asking for a ride			0
phone records at the time , long since lost , indicated that a collect call was placed from a pay phone in @entity327 to the @entity338 home in @entity24 at 6:57 p.m. by someone giving his name as " @entity342			0
" the call lasted two minutes			0
@entity20 law does not allow police reports and other documents as a substitute for witness testimony at trials			0
but in this case , almost all of the @entity159 agents and police investigators had died , and @entity27 's defense sought to introduce the reports as " ancient documents " or public records more than 20 years old			2
@entity149 , the trial judge , rejected that argument			0
" the judge 's decisions to prohibit @entity11 from introducing @entity159 records prepared at the time of the offense , despite their status as ancient documents and public records and their probative value in establishing mr. @entity368 's alibi , and to prohibit mr. @entity368 from presenting testimony showing another man committed the offense , amounted to gross abuses of discretion denying mr. @entity368 his fundamental right to present a defense , " the appeal stated			1
by blocking the defense while allowing prosecutors to introduce " irrelevant , but highly prejudicial evidence , " the judge violated @entity27 's right to a fair trial , the appeal stated , before delivering a final salvo : " no rational trier of fact would have found the defendant guilty			2
" police get break in missing girls ' cold case from 1975 arrest in 40 - year - old murder case four decades later , disappearance of 2 missing girls blamed on wreck			1
