if marrying design and engineering is a fine art , then who better for the job than sailing 's answer to " @entity8 with an @entity9 ? " like @entity8 , this is man whose canvas is a tablet			2
his subject ? @entity14 , quick racing boats			2
@entity16 , who counts @entity17 among his former employers , has been tasked with designing a vessel capable of winning the 2017 @entity20 -- sailing 's most prestigious race			1
his new boss is a man who knows a thing or two about winning , multiple @entity24 champion @entity22			2
the knight of the realm is behind a bold bid to bring the @entity20 to @entity29 shores for the first time			1
the competition is still two years away but at the temporary home of @entity34 on an industrial estate just outside @entity36 , they are plotting victory			1
" everyone wants to see the champagne flying at the finish -- that 's the sound bites and visual bites that people live for , " @entity38 told @entity0			2
" but the main chapters of this are being written now			2
the @entity20 is being won now			1
" @entity48 's temporary base -- they will relocate to a bigger headquarters next may on @entity36 's waterfront -- gives little indication of the expertise at work with its white , spartan interior			2
inside there are decades worth of experience among the 55 - strong workforce , which will rise to near 100 by the time of the @entity20			1
money and cutting - edge technology are key to this operation but , for @entity38 , who modestly downplays himself as " the old guy on the team " , the most valuable ingredient is far more simplistic			0
" most of the time it 's not the biggest spender that wins , " says the @entity67			0
" the most expensive commodity is time			0
you 're always learning and it 's the person that learns the most that will have the fastest boat			1
" with every minute precious in the countdown to the big race , no wonder the pictorial greeting on the first flight of stairs from the entrance for any visitor to @entity82 is a quote from @entity87 : " do n't count the days , make the days count			0
" " in terms of setting structure and design philosophy , that happens now , " says @entity89 as he reflects on the process of filling key management roles before steadily expanding the sailing , design and on - shore workforce			2
" if we get this bit wrong , we 'll never recover			0
and unfortunately until we 're on the start line , we wo n't know for sure how we 've done			0
" @entity89 's first call was to @entity104 , the team 's technical director			1
in @entity107 terms , he is like an @entity108 , who has since signed up to the @entity48 project , to a @entity110 during their time together at @entity112			2
@entity104 competed in the same era as @entity89 's coach @entity114 and has been involved in @entity20 racing since 1983			1
he and @entity89 got to know each other during the 2007 @entity20 when @entity89 was part of the @entity119 set - up			1
a keen engineer for as long as he can remember , @entity104 likens the project to , " a @entity123 set -- you have to make sure you pick all the right bits			1
" but , because of the sheer numbers involved , he admits " it 's like playing rugby with 100 players			2
" fortunately for @entity104 , it 's not a case of starting from scratch			1
" the thing is that someone 's always done something similar before so there are rules of thumb , " he explains			0
" a lot of projects are n't rocket science			0
we 're not going to invent some new technology that will win us the @entity20			1
what we will do is reassemble existing technology that can help us			0
" that starts with the simplicity of a @entity149 sketch either on paper or more often an @entity9 , which he started to use to share his ideas more easily with his colleagues			0
this is then fed into a @entity156 computer model overseen by @entity157			0
@entity158 's @entity157 is one of 11 nationalities currently represented on the design team , which also prides itself on a " best of @entity29 " approach			0
a rarity on the team as an @entity20 debutant , the former architect explains : " i try to model the ideas from everybody and try to make it as a 3d model so everyone can sit around and discuss			1
" everyone feeds it into me and i try to give everyone feedback because sometimes ideas clash and you can not physically fit them together so i try to come up with solutions and present solutions to everybody else and say ' this idea did n't really work - what about this ? ' " how versatile the team can be with their design is curtailed by the @entity20 rule book			1
for example , it tells you the boat must have two hulls a certain length apart and be of a certain length and width			2
" under the rules , it quickly becomes clearer in a picture what the boat looks like , " adds @entity104			1
" to the naked eye , all the boats will look similar			0
the disparity will come as these boats are fantastically difficult to sail			0
there 's lots of opportunity to do things well and badly			0
" the designers may use a wind tunnel to test a certain part but the computational tools at their disposal are so accurate it is not always required			0
so once sent through the 3d model , individual parts are sent to an external supplier with the touch of a button and , as @entity104 says , " it turns up in a box at the end of the week			1
" deciding how long to spend designing products while also minimizing manufacturing time is a balancing act			0
the first testing boat ( @entity227 ) is already out on the water , @entity225 is expected to be fully operational in may while the eventual boat on which @entity89 and his team will race for the @entity20 is set to be finalized in design terms by the end of next year 's sailing season			1
" there is an end point and that 's the $ 64,000 question when that is , " explains @entity104			1
" you 're balancing pushing the design time but also the amount of time the guys can spend on the water			0
" a myriad of different organizations are on board with @entity89 's team from the @entity29 @entity246 to big players in aerospace and engineering company @entity248 , which boasts a rich motorsport history			0
and while the majority of the staff have been picked for their @entity20 pedigree , others have been headhunted from elsewhere			1
@entity255 is the boyfriend of @entity29 @entity24 skeleton gold medallist @entity256 and previously worked at @entity258 and latterly @entity259			0
he helped design the sleds that @entity256 and , before her , @entity261 , drove to @entity24 glory			0
his role at @entity264 is simulation support and the once budding sailor is adamant his skills translate from ice to water			0
" it 's engineering and optimization and working with athletes with equipment so there are a lot of parallels , " he says			0
his job is to work on performance prediction programs and writing code to foresee how the boat will behave and react with sailors and new equipment			2
but for all the brains and cutting - edge technology behind it , there is no guarantee this $ 130 million project will ultimately prove successful			1
" that 's the elephant in the room , " admits @entity104 , though the buzz through the open - plan office suggests a team brimming with confidence that it is currently on the right path			1
ultimately , @entity89 is a fiercely determined sailor and he is adamant the team can " bring back the @entity20 to @entity29 " for the first time in the event 's history			1

we go inside @entity34 to find out how exactly an @entity20 boat is built
the $ 130m project currently has a workforce of 55 which is set to grow to 100 by the @entity20
technical director @entity104 likens it to a @entity123 set , *slotting* pieces together
