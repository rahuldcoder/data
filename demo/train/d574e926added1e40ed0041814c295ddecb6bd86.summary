the 22 - year - old has told @entity9 newspaper @entity8 he feels his career has stalled since his move to @entity12 , and if the situation does not improve soon he will seek a transfer in january 's @entity16 transfer window			1
@entity1 said that he had told @entity6 about his feelings but the situation remained unresolved : " i have tried to talk to the manager but it is n't of any use			1
i could n't really do anything with the feedback [ he ] gave me			2
how well is @entity6 performing in the battle of the managerial mind games ? " we have agreed to look at my situation during the winter			1
if there 's no improvement then , i have to be honest , i [ will ] want to play somewhere else			2
i do n't play a lot so i ca n't be happy and i ca n't cheer out loud			0
" certain emotions are blocked , they are pushed back by all the worries i carry with me			0
sometimes i wonder how long i can sustain it but i will fight for my position - what else can i do ? " he added			2

@entity6 has injury problems to contend with too ; @entity1 , who scored a against @entity46 in their last @entity16 encounter , @entity58 and @entity59 are all sidelined			1
however , the under pressure boss remained positive before the game in a pre-match press conference : " the last time we qualified it was amazing , '' said @entity6			1
" we did it in a good way with four goals against @entity68 , four goals against @entity70 and eight against @entity72			0
" it will be difficult , but we have to do our job , win against @entity40 and then look at @entity46 's result			0
@entity46 know that qualifying first is an incentive , it will be good for their confidence and they will get some money too			0
" @entity46 have this incentive and they are a good team			0
if we can play against @entity48 with options it will be fantastic			0
'' @entity3 defender @entity83 also remained upbeat : " we always believe at this club that we can do special things			1
we have done it in the past and we know we can do it again , " he told reporters			0
