he never touched me ! " or , "			0
never laid a hand on me ! " or " never looked at me " or " never listened " or " was too busy looking at the computer screen			0
" i take these statements as validating my belief that it is important for the physician to listen to the patient and to perform a skilled physical exam and it is more important than ever in this era of technology			1
of course , when you take that position , you run the risk of being called a @entity23			0
the truth is , i love and embrace technology , and have no desire to return to the @entity28 scan and pre-mri days of old			1
but i see no reason to let new technology make us lose the abilities we have had for over a hundred years to make sophisticated diagnosis at the bedside			1
indeed , it should make us so much better			0
there are clearly two very different ways of being a 21st - century physician in nations with advanced health care : in the first way , call it the old way , the patient 's story ( the history ) is critically listened to and examined , because the diagnosis often lurks in that simple step			1
after that , the physical exam begins : here the actual body becomes the text , a text that is changing and must be frequently re-examined and read by the time - honored methods of inspection , palpation , percussion and auscultation ( listening with a stethoscope )			1
the scent in the room that might signal liver failure , or the expression of a family member that contradicts what the patient says , or the feel of a giant spleen -- these are valid soundings , pieces of phenotypic information that are even more valuable than knowing the patient 's genotype			1
( in other words , it is great to have a genetic test that says you have a certain risk of skin cancer , but it would be just as important to have a physician who can detect that cancer — the phenotype - before it has spread			2
) indeed almost all of dermatologic diagnosis is made by this step , but so also many other diagnoses can be made by this method			0
the physician then judiciously asks for blood tests and selectively gets imaging ( by ultrasound or @entity92 ) and putting it all together , comes away with a holistic understanding of the unique individual who is wrestling with a problem			0
@entity97 : your health depends on where you live the other way of being a physician tends to pay less attention to the living patient — indeed , the patient can almost seem like a distraction , because it is the " @entity109 " , ( the term i coined for the virtual construct of the patient in the computer ) that is being treated and examined			2
increasingly , more and more physician time gets taken up with the @entity109 , leaving the real patient in the bed feeling neglected			1
and the bizarre way health care is funded and the way incentives are lined up in this country ( we are paid to do to people , rather than for people — sticking a needle in or performing a test pays more than listening ) , we are pushed to spend more time with the " @entity109 " ( much of it spent documenting the time we supposedly have spent with the live patient )			1
@entity97 : @entity131 on how we can avoid aging though we can debate the merits of the two methods ( and i think it is not much of a debate ) , it is clear that patients prefer the former method			2
that is because a visit to a doctor is not a cognitive exercise by two individuals and a computer — a crossword puzzle to be jointly solved			0
instead , it is a complex human - with - human interaction			2
indeed it is a ritual			0
rituals , i have learned from my anthropology colleagues , are all about transformation : the elaborate rituals of baptism and wedding are associated with crossing a threshold , a transformation			0
when one individual ( a patient ) seeks help from another individual , and confides in that other person , and then incredibly , disrobes and allows touch , that has all the trappings of a ritual — it is not a mere cognitive exercise			2
instead it is a ritual that is fundamental to the doctor - patient relationship and one , particularly in chronic disease or in terminal illness , that conveys to the patient a sense of the physician 's commitment to being there , to never abandoning the patient			1
indeed , it does not in any way negate the importance of technology but instead complements it			2
in short , it is just good medicine			0
moreover , it is what most patients want			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			1

@entity191 : in age of technology , old - *fashioned* physical exam still vital
technology , *reimbursement* push doctors to spend more time on *electronic* records , he says
patients complain that doctors spend too little time with them and do *n't* listen , he says
@entity191 : listening to and examining a patient can yield key *insights*
