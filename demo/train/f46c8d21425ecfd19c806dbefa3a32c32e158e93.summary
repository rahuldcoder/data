-- i do n't want to write this			0
as part of breast cancer awareness month , a 40 - year - old anchor had her first mammogram on morning television			1
and last week the anchor , @entity8 , underwent a double mastectomy after announcing she had cancer , and saying -- in front of 5 million viewers -- that " having a mammogram saved my life			1
" and i feel the obligation to point out that other possibilities are more likely			0
to understand why , you need to know how doctors now think about cancer : in terms of turtles , rabbits and birds			1
the goal is not to let any of the animals escape the barnyard pen to become deadly			0
but the turtles are n't going anywhere anyway			0
they are the indolent , nonlethal cancers			1
the rabbits are ready to hop out at any time			0
they are the potentially lethal cancers , cancers that might be stopped by early detection and treatment			1
then there are the birds			0
quite simply , they are already gone			0
they are the most aggressive cancers , the ones that have already spread by the time they are detectable , the ones that are beyond cure			1
before i go through the other possibilities , let me be clear about something : i know @entity8 has been through an emotionally gut - wrenching month			1
i know she is worried about her children			0
i know her parents are worried about her			0
and i truly hope the mammogram served a purpose -- that it saved her life			1
it is understandable that any woman with a screening - detected cancer would want to believe this			1
but all women contemplating mammography should understand the other possibilities			2
one possibility is that it could not save a life , that the woman will ultimately die from her disease			2
thankfully this possibility is the least likely			0
yet in every trial of screening , some women die from breast cancer despite its being detected early			1
it 's not the mammogram 's fault , it 's the bird 's fault			1
the birds are the reason why the rate at which women present with metastatic breast cancer in the @entity79 remains unchanged , despite three decades of widespread screening mammography			1
another possibility is that early detection was unnecessary -- that she could have done just as well had her cancer progressed to the point she noticed a breast lump			1
doctors are getting pretty good at dealing with rabbits			0
while the news media tends to focus on screening , the bigger story in breast cancer is the dramatic improvement in treatment over the last 20 years			1
ironically , the better we are at treating breast cancer -- the less important it is to screen for it			2
the final possibility is that she was overdiagnosed -- diagnosed with a cancer that may not have been destined to ever bother her			1
cancer biologists now recognize that small collections of abnormal cells may meet the pathological criteria for cancer , yet never progress to affect the patient			2
in other words , her cancer may have been a turtle : it may not have been going anywhere anyway			2
while doctors used to debate whether turtles really existed in breast cancer , now the debate is about how many turtles exist			2
even the program that promotes screening mammography in the @entity120 now acknowledges that women are three times more likely to be overdiagnosed than they are to have their " life saved			1
" some researchers think the overdiagnosed to lives - saved ratio is closer to 10 to 1			1
others might argue it 's considerably less			2
overdiagnosis is notoriously difficult to quantify			0
but most agree overdiagnosis is more common than having your life saved			1
that nuance is lost in the powerful survivor stories that appear regularly in the media			0
of course , everyone wants to interpret them as evidence of the benefit of mammograms			0
unfortunately , the more likely interpretation is that they represent evidence of harm : unnecessary surgery , chemotherapy and / or radiation			0
why is this important ? video images of individuals purported to be helped exaggerate the benefit of mammography , while hiding its harms			0
they impede efforts to balance the process , such as screening less frequently or starting later in life			2
and they give more weight to the idea that the way to deal with cancer is to find more of it			2
why do n't i want to write this ? because no one wants to dispute the interpretation of a well - meaning cancer patient who is trying to help people			0
and no one wants to make a difficult situation any harder			0
but news stories about health -- particularly on television -- are too driven by powerful personal anecdotes			0
the public deserves more nuance			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182			1

@entity182 : @entity8 had double mastectomy when mammogram *revealed* cancer
she says mammogram saved her life ; he says that 's not how it works . cancers all different
he says cancers may be very slow ; early discovery may lead to unneeded harmful treatment
@entity182 : study : women 3 times more likely to be overdiagnosed than to have " life saved "
