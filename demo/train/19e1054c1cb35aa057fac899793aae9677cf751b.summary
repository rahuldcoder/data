@entity1 's president announced progress on a ceasefire agreement wednesday with @entity4 , but @entity6 president @entity5 greeted it with skepticism and @entity8 downplayed it			1
@entity5 , speaking in @entity9 ahead of a @entity11 summit in @entity12 , said he was aware of the reported deal , as conflicting accounts emerged from @entity4 and @entity1			1
but he said it was too early to see if all sides would follow through			0
any ceasefire effort has not worked up to now , he said , " either because @entity4 has not supported it or pretended it is not controlling the separatists " in eastern @entity1			1
" having said that , if in fact @entity4 is prepared to stop financing , arming , training and in many cases joining with @entity4 troops ' activities in @entity1 , and is serious about a political settlement , that is something that we all hope for , " @entity5 said			1
meanwhile , @entity32 , a member of @entity11 , wo n't be delivering the first warship it is due to deliver @entity4 as part of a 2011 contract , the office of @entity32 president @entity31 said			1
" @entity39 has noted that , despite the prospect of a ceasefire that remains to be confirmed and implemented , the conditions for @entity32 to authorize the delivery of the first ( warship ) are not authorized , " the statement said			0
since mid-april , @entity1 forces have been battling @entity46 rebels in eastern @entity1			0
@entity47 and the @entity48 say the rebels are supported by @entity8 -- a claim @entity8 denies			0
@entity1 president @entity51 's office initially said he and @entity4 president @entity52 had agreed to " a full ceasefire " following a phone call , but subsequently indicated they had agreed on a process that could lead to a truce			1
" the conversation resulted in an agreement on ceasefire regime in the @entity62 ( eastern @entity1 region ) , " said the statement from the presidential press office			2
" the parties reached mutual understanding on the steps that will facilitate the establishment of peace			0
" earlier , @entity52 spokesman @entity69 told @entity70 there was " no confirmation of a ceasefire because @entity52 can not agree ( to ) a ceasefire because he is not party to the conflict			1
" what was agreed were steps that would lead to a ceasefire			0
the important thing is to bring an end to the bloodshed and to stop the firing			0
everyone is trying to de-escalate the conflict			0
" @entity69 also said the longer term issue of constitutional reform in @entity1 was not discussed			0
however , the spokesman told @entity4 state news agency @entity90 that @entity52 's view on possible ways out of the crisis " largely coincides " with that of @entity51			1
@entity52 's roadmap @entity4 's president presented his roadmap for a ceasefire to journalists wednesday , the state - run @entity97 news agency reported			1
setting out his seven - point plan , @entity52 said both parties in the conflict must negotiate immediately and stop " any offensive military operations by the army , armed forces and self - defense groups of the southeast of @entity1 towards @entity111 and @entity112			1
" @entity4 routinely refers to the rebels as self - defense forces			0
@entity52 called for @entity1 troops to pull back to a distance that would mean they ca n't fire shells on communities			1
he also urged an end to the use of military aircraft against civilians and an exchange of all hostages			0
the @entity4 president said the sides should " provide full and objective international control over the conditions for the ceasefire and monitoring of the situation			2
" humanitarian corridors also should be opened to permit delivery of aid to communities in @entity111 and @entity112 , he added , and workers should get access so they can rebuild cities ' infrastructure			0
@entity1 prime minister @entity140 dismissed @entity52 's roadmap as looking like a " rescue plan " for the rebels , and said @entity4 could not be trusted to stick to any agreement			1
" this plan is yet another attempt to trick the international community on the eve of @entity11 summit and avoid the @entity153 decision of the next level of sanctions against @entity4 , " he said , according to the @entity146 's press office			2
" @entity52 's real plan is to destroy @entity1 and renew the @entity157			1
" @entity5 flies to @entity158 with a warning for @entity52 rebels question ceasefire a rebel spokesman in eastern @entity1 expressed doubt a ceasefire could hold and demanded federal troops withdraw from the region , according to @entity97			1
an aide to another rebel leader , the @entity169 's first deputy prime minister @entity168 , told the news agency that @entity51 's ceasefire move was unilateral and was " impractical " while there were still @entity1 forces in the disputed region			2
" this is some sort of a game by @entity47			0
this decision was made without us , " @entity179 's aide quoted him as saying , according to the news agency			0
@entity52 has consistently argued that @entity4 has no say over ending the conflict because it is not involved in it on the ground			1
@entity6 and @entity11 officials say that in recent days @entity4 has sent its own troops and heavy weaponry into @entity1 , as well as training and arming the rebels			1
@entity5 vows support @entity5 , giving a speech in @entity194 , @entity9 , ahead of a @entity11 summit this week , said a vision of a @entity158 dedicated to peace and freedom is " threatened by @entity4 's aggression against @entity1			1
" it challenges the most basic principles of the international system : that no border can be redrawn at the barrel of a gun , @entity5 said			0
he vowed @entity11 will always come to the defense of its member states , including the @entity209 nations			0
" we will defend our @entity11 allies , and that means every ally , " he said , including @entity9			0
@entity1 is not part of @entity11 , but the alliance has said it will support @entity47 in the face of what it says is @entity4 aggression			1
defense secretary @entity220 defended the @entity6 response to the @entity1 conflict and dismissed any criticism that the diplomatic efforts have failed to de-escalate the tension			2
@entity226 blamed @entity52 for fueling the @entity1 crisis			1
the @entity4 president " continues to take very dangerous escalatory actions , " @entity226 told @entity70			2
the continued escalation by @entity52 would bring further consequences , but @entity226 added that " we 're not going to get into a military engagement , a war , over this with @entity4			1
" on the battlefield traces of warfare remained starkly evident in eastern @entity1 near the town of @entity240			0
one road was a graveyard for burned - out military vehicles stretching for 1.5 miles : tanks , trucks , armored personnel vehicles			0
there was even a surface - to - surface missile laying on the side of the road			0
shallow graves were dug a distance from the roadway , and an odor of decomposition permeated the air			0
@entity70 's @entity257 found a @entity4 military food box labeled " @entity259 , " an apparent indication that @entity4 has some involvement in the conflict , though @entity8 vehemently denies it			2
apparel belonging to the @entity264 was also found among battlefield debris , but it was unclear wednesday what happened in the recent fire fight between @entity46 separatists and @entity1 forces			0
military exercises @entity1 's @entity272 announced wednesday that @entity1 would host multinational exercises later this month with the @entity6 , @entity11 and other nations			2
it said 200 @entity6 soldiers are expected to take part in the exercise , alongside about 1,000 servicemen from @entity1 , @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 and @entity290			2
earlier , speaking alongside the @entity9 president , @entity5 announced that additional @entity6 personnel and aircraft are being rotated through the @entity294 as part of @entity11 operations			2
@entity5 's trip to @entity9 , before he heads to the @entity11 summit in @entity12 , is meant to reassure nervous @entity158 that @entity52 's support for separatists in @entity1 does n't mean he has a free pass for territorial gains elsewhere			1
the @entity6 and @entity153 have agreed that additional economic sanctions are needed to curb @entity4 's actions in @entity1			1
" the sanctions that we 've applied so far have had a real effect on @entity4 , and i think it 's important for us to continue to impose costs on @entity4 , so long as it is violating basic principles of international law , " said @entity5			2
@entity314 nations will consider proposals for " significant further steps " against @entity4 on wednesday afternoon , an @entity153 statement said			2
the proposed sanctions regard " access to capital markets , defense , dual use goods , and sensitive technologies , " the statement added .			0

@entity52 may face consequences but @entity6 wo n't go to " war " with @entity4 , @entity226 says
@entity52 presents a series of steps he says would *restore* peace to @entity1
@entity5 says a peaceful @entity158 " is threatened by @entity4 's aggression against @entity1 "
@entity52 spokesman says @entity4 ca n't agree to a ceasefire because it 's not party in conflict
