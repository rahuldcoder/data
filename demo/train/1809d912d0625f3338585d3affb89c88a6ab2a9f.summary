@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity1 's @entity4 set up shop in the capital , @entity0 , it found the cupboard was bare			1
" we only had $ 13.5 million in the @entity9 , " according to @entity10 , the oil and economy minister and one of the first senior officials of the @entity4 to arrive in the capital			1
@entity15 was on the run , but an acute shortage of @entity1 dinar -- the national currency -- threatened to stop the revolution in its tracks			1
" i was willing to do anything to get the urgent needs to the @entity1 , " @entity10 said last week			1
" we used parallel markets in the exchange of the money			1
" " parallel markets " meant wealthy currency dealers in @entity28 , who apparently had many more dinar at their disposal than @entity15 's @entity9 in @entity0 or the rebels ' own @entity33 in @entity28			1
with names like @entity38 and @entity39 , they became the financial lubricant of @entity42 forces			2
the @entity4 's financial arm , the @entity44 , had by then already tapped into this informal network of foreign exchange dealers , but not without some controversy			1
early in august , according to one source familiar with the @entity44 's dealings , it exchanged $ 10 million at a rate of 1.45 dinar to the dollar			2
the source said that was less than the prevailing market rate of 1.55 dinar , suggesting that the dealer involved did exceptionally well			0
another transaction later in august also appeared to be at less than the market rate			0
" on what basis did they choose those dealers and those exchange rates ? " the source asked			1
one currency dealer in @entity28 , @entity66 , said the @entity44 's dealings smacked of favoritism			1
. the @entity44 says all its dealings have been transparent			0
it says it had to use the " parallel " market and was sanctioned to do so by the rebels ' " @entity33 , " which was established in @entity28 soon after @entity15 's forces were ejected from the city			1
@entity44 officials said the central bank simply did not have the available funds to exchange large sums of cash , so it designated exchange dealers to be used			1
e-mails obtained by @entity2 suggest that those dealers drove a hard bargain with the @entity44			2
one wrote in august that he was withdrawing an offer to exchange at a rate of 1.45 dinar to the dollar because " no transfer was made , with situation changing in @entity1			1
... therefore we had to change the ex-rate to be @entity91			0
" in the chaos of the uprising , there was plenty of cash floating -- and flying -- around @entity1			2
much of it came from the @entity99 and went to groups and fighters beyond the @entity4 's control			1
on one occasion , according to the @entity44 's director , @entity104 , a currency trader arrived at @entity106 short of 20,000 dinar			2
the money was due to leave on a flight to aid civilians in the western mountains who had n't received salaries and pensions			0
@entity115 was short , and a @entity44 official who had previously spent his own cash on a project was told to take an equivalent sum from a stockpile of cash held on board the plane			2
a guard thought he was stealing and reported the incident			0
" it was a bad judgment call on his part , " says @entity126 of the official , " and i paid for it through the gossip channels			0
" " it was a big mistake not communicating every step of our work			0
we were too busy getting things done , " @entity104 says			0
but he insists the @entity44 has had plenty of oversight			0
" we have a steering board which includes a representative from the governments of @entity139 and @entity140			0
we have an independent financial managing agent ...			0
they have to approve every transaction , every exchange and every project we do , " he told @entity2 in an e-mail			0
as for the shortage of @entity1 dinar , that has eased , in part thanks to the @entity151			2
at the end of august it flew banknotes worth 280 million dinar to @entity28 , part of a stock of 1.86 billion dinar that had been frozen in the @entity159 with the passage of @entity161 1970 .			0

@entity1 's new government was faced with urgent financial needs , says an official
the @entity4 used " parallel markets " to exchange *incoming* monies for local currency
" parallel markets " meant dealing with wealthy currency dealers
*criticism* has arisen over exchange rates and *expenditures*
