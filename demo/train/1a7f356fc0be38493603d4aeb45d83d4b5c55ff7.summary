-- when passengers boarded @entity3 17 last week , they could n't have known they were about to fly over a battlefield			2
but hours later , at 33,000 feet above eastern @entity6 , a missile ended the lives of 298 innocent civilians			0
that flight was n't the only one in the corridor that day nor was it the lone one to fly above a conflict area			2
after @entity14 was shot down the @entity13 told @entity16 airlines they could no longer fly in that region			1
and after a rocket launched from @entity20 landed within a mile of @entity21 in @entity22 , the agency banned flights from the @entity16 to @entity24 for 24 hours			1
in other areas , including ones where there is violence on the ground , the @entity13 restricts what @entity16 planes can do			1
over @entity33 , @entity16 - based airlines can fly as long as their planes are above 20,000 feet			1
that is out of range of most -- but as @entity38 proved , not all -- missiles			0
there are warnings in effect for eight other areas , including @entity43 and @entity44			1
the threats include missiles and small arms fire , but airlines can fly there if they want			1
the decision for the airlines comes down to this : do they just adhere to government regulations , which in effect establish minimum requirements , or do they use more caution ? " government regulations are a floor			1
the government says , ' you ca n't be in the business unless you do this , ' " @entity0 aviation analyst and former inspector general for the @entity16 @entity64 @entity63 said on " @entity65			1
" " you can go above it			0
your airline can be safer , you can be more secure			0
" on the ground in @entity33 , the well - funded terrorist group @entity72 is fighting government troops , while above there is a busy highway in the sky with hundreds of flights			1
every day @entity79 7 travels from @entity81 to @entity82 and soars over @entity33			1
there are other flights with @entity16 ties that travel over fighting			1
@entity87 82 each day goes over @entity44 as it travels from @entity88 , @entity89 , to @entity90 , @entity91			1
it would be difficult to reroute these flights without increasing the time in the air by hours			0
" airlines have always had to make decisions about whether particular cities are safe to operate to , " said @entity95 , the chief executive officer of the @entity96			2
@entity38 's route from @entity101 in the @entity102 to @entity103 , @entity3 , would have been more than 6,000 miles			2
there were more than 800 flights that flew that corridor in the week before the shoot down			0
" we followed that flight path accordingly , " said @entity108 , commercial director for @entity109 said			2
" and it was accepted by the @entity114 air traffic control			0
and like many other airlines that had been flying that route for many , many weeks and with hundreds of airlines passing that route every day , we believed it was safe to do so			1
" after @entity14 was shot down in eastern @entity6 , that region joined @entity121 , north @entity122 , northern @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 as off limits to @entity16 aircraft			1
pilots have some input into the route			2
" we have a collaborative decision process with the dispatcher , " said 777 pilot @entity131 , a @entity0 aviation analyst			1
" myself as the pilot in command as captain of the plane and the dispatcher ( who plans the flight )			0
the dispatcher has a lot of the information ; i ca n't get all of it			0
we get it in a notam -- notice to @entity147 ( from the @entity13 )			2
so this information , whether it be intelligence information about air space , information about weather , it 's all part of that process			0
if there 's something that we see that says , ' hey , i do n't like this , ' we make a phone call			0
most of the time we get this electronically			0
" in the case of @entity38 , the minimum altitude requirement ( set by @entity6 authorities ) was 32,000 feet			0
it was supposed to be safe			0
" threat information is only as good as the intelligence supplied by air traffic control and its cooperating governments , " @entity131 says in an editorial on why @entity109 is not at fault for flying where @entity168 was traveling			0
opinion : do n't blame @entity109			0

planes also fly over @entity33 , @entity44 and other countries where *bullets* fly
the @entity13 does tell @entity16 *carriers* not to travel over some areas , issues warnings for others
@entity0 aviation analyst says airlines can go above and beyond government regulations
commercial pilot says captains work with dispatchers , can request adjusted route
