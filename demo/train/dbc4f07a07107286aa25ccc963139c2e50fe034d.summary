the @entity1 wrongful death trial , which promises dramatic revelations and legal fireworks , begins in a small @entity5 courtroom with opening statements monday			1
jurors earning $ 15 a day will listen to several months of testimony before deciding whether one of the world 's largest entertainment companies should pay @entity1 's mother and three children billions of dollars for its liability in the pop icon 's death			1
@entity19 family members , including @entity20 , will sit just a few feet from the jury as @entity1 's oldest son and daughter describe their father 's last days			1
but they will also endure weeks of tedious testimony from medical and financial experts offering opinions about the singer 's health , addiction and career			0
later in the trial , jurors will @entity1 's oldest son and daughter describe their father 's last days			1
but they will also endure weeks of tedious testimony from medical and financial experts offering opinions about the singer 's health , addiction and career			0
only 16 journalists and a few members of the public will be allowed inside the courtroom because many of its 45 seats are reserved for parties involved in the trial , including the @entity48			0
@entity50 judge @entity49 denied @entity52 's request to televise the trial			0
pretrial hearings have featured angry and personal exchanges between lawyers for the two sides , made more intense by the intimacy of the tiny courtroom			0
jurors chosen to decide @entity1 wrongful death case the central issue the central issue is simple : did @entity63 , the company promoting @entity1 's comeback concerts in 2009 , hire or supervise dr. @entity65 , the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in @entity1 's june 25 , 2009 , death ? @entity1 died two weeks before his " @entity69 " comeback concerts , organized by @entity63 , were to have debuted in @entity70			1
the coroner ruled @entity1 died from a fatal combination of sedatives and propofol , a surgical anesthetic that @entity65 told investigators he used to put @entity19 to sleep almost every night in the month before his death			1
the @entity78 will argue that @entity63 executives knew about the star 's weakened health and his past use of dangerous drugs while on tour			1
they 're liable in his death because they pressured @entity1 and the doctor to meet their ambitious schedule to prepare for the @entity70 shows despite that knowledge , their lawyers contend			1
a cornerstone of their case is an e-mail @entity63 co-ceo @entity94 wrote 11 days before @entity1 's death			1
the e-mail to show director @entity96 addressed concerns that @entity65 had kept @entity1 from a rehearsal the day before : " we want to remind ( @entity65 ) that it is @entity63 , not @entity1 , who is paying his salary			1
we want to remind him what is expected of him			0
" @entity1 lawyers argue the e-mail is evidence that @entity63 used @entity65 's fear of losing his lucrative job as @entity1 's personal physician to pressure him to have @entity1 ready for rehearsals despite his fragile health			1
@entity63 will defend itself by arguing that @entity1 was responsible for his own demise , that he chose @entity65 to be his full - time doctor and that his drug addiction led him to a series of fatal choices			1
@entity65 was never an @entity63 employee but rather was chosen and paid by @entity1 for nearly four years until @entity1 died , @entity63 lawyers contend			1
" i do n't know how you ca n't look to mr. @entity1 's responsibility there , " @entity63 lawyer @entity115 told @entity52			1
" he was a grown man			0
" child molestation accusations against @entity1 , for which he was acquitted after a trial , are relevant because they " resulted in an incredible increase in his drug intake , " @entity115 said			0
" mr. @entity1 is a person who was known to doctor shop , " @entity115 said			0
" he was known to be someone who would tell one doctor one thing and another doctor something else			0
" when @entity49 ruled in february that case warranted a jury trial , she found there was evidence to support the @entity78 ' claim that @entity63 executives could have foreseen that @entity65 would use dangerous drugs in treating the singer			2
@entity140 ' ghost haunts @entity1 death trial @entity1 's family seeks billions just before monday 's session began , the judge issued a series of rulings which allow @entity1 expert witnesses to testify , although limited some of their opinions			1
the lawsuit seeks a judgment against @entity63 equal to the money @entity1 would have earned over the course of his remaining lifetime if he had not died in 2009			1
@entity1 lawyers denied media reports that they were seeking $ 40 billion in damages if @entity63 is found liable , but it could cost the company several billion dollars , according to estimates of @entity1 's income potential			1
@entity63 is a subsidiary of @entity63 , a global entertainment company that was up for sale recently with an $ 8 billion asking price			2
@entity49 reversed an earlier tentative decision monday that would have limited the amount of damages the @entity1 's could argued @entity63 should pay if found liable in the singer 's death			1
the decision raises the potential damages by about $ 1 billion , bringing it to as much as $ 5 billion			0
one of the @entity78 ' experts , certified public accountant @entity170 , estimated that @entity1 could have earned $ 1.4 billion by taking his " @entity69 " tour around the world for 260 shows			2
@entity63 executives discussed extending the tour beyond the 50 shows scheduled for @entity70 , @entity1 lawyers said			1
@entity1 lawyer @entity177 , in arguing for the judge to allow @entity170 's testimony , said when " @entity69 " tickets went on sale in march 2009 , there was the " highest demand to see anyone in the history of the world			1
no one has ever come close			0
" " there was so much demand , they filled 2 million seats in hours , " @entity177 said , quoting an e-mail from @entity63 ceo @entity63 sent to @entity63 's owner			2
" we would have had to do 100 - plus shows to fill the demand " in @entity70 , he said @entity63 wrote			2
@entity1 could have packed the @entity196 several times in a world tour , he said			0
but @entity63 lawyer @entity199 called it " very speculative " that @entity1 would have even finished the 50 @entity70 shows before dying			2
@entity63 lawyers argued that @entity1 did n't perform 260 shows and make that much money even in his prime			2
" he never came anywhere close to that , " @entity205 said			0
" no one other than @entity207 has ever done that			0
" @entity170 also calculated @entity1 would have followed with four more world tours before he turned 65			0
@entity49 weighed in during a hearing on thursday , noting that the @entity211 are still touring into their 70s			0
the @entity78 will also try to convince jurors that he would have made a fortune off of a long series of @entity216 shows , endorsements , a clothing line and movies			0
@entity205 argued that @entity1 had a history of failed projects and missed opportunities , calling @entity224 's projections " a hope , a dream , and not a basis for damages			2
" @entity170 , under the new ruling , will be able to tell jurors about the " loss of earning capacity " suffered by the family because of @entity1 's death			1
this means the jury can consider how the @entity1 argument that he could have earned millions with a clothing line , endorsements and movies			0
the expert 's estimate that @entity1 would have completed five world tours before he was 65 , if he had lived , can also be considered			2
@entity63 can argue , however , that @entity1 's past failures diminished the potential earnings			1
none of the @entity1 experts can offer an opinion on the question of if dr. @entity65 was hired by @entity63			2
if @entity63 is found liable , the company 's lawyers want the judge to tell the jury to reduce any damages by the amount @entity1 's estate earned from the documentary made from video the company shot of his rehearsals			1
" if there is a benefit in it , then that is deducted from a loss , " @entity205 said			0
@entity1 lawyer @entity265 compared giving @entity63 credit for the " @entity69 " profits to being " like you murdered someone , wrote a book about them and gave them the money			2
" @entity265 , who will deliver the @entity78 ' opening statement monday morning , said he was not sure who his first witness will be tuesday morning			0
he did tell the court he will show several videos of the depositions given by @entity63 's top executives in the first week			2
@entity265 and @entity63 's @entity115 will each have two and a half hours to describe their cases to the jury in opening statements starting at 10 a.m. monday			0
the witness lists include many members of the @entity48 , including matriarch @entity287			0
other celebrity witnesses on the list are @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity296			0
