-- the recent closure of 32 privately owned radio stations and a proposed law to punish " media crimes " are signs that @entity7 president @entity6 is moving to quash criticism of his government , according to a recent @entity11 intelligence report			1
a group of @entity14 rioters beats @entity7 journalists in downtown @entity16 on august 13			2
@entity6 's government is " moving forcefully to silence critics , " said the unclassified @entity11 analysis prepared by the @entity18 , a @entity11 government office that translates and analyzes reports from foreign news organizations			1
the relationship between privately owned media in @entity7 and the leftist @entity6 has never been rosy			1
@entity6 has accused private television stations of supporting his brief ouster in 2002 , and the president was a driving force behind denying a license renewal in 2007 to one broadcaster he said cooperated with the opposition			2
but the decisions this month by the @entity6 government to close 32 radio stations and two television broadcasters and to support legislation that would create prison sentences for people who commit " media crimes " have created a new level of scrutiny from outside @entity7			1
" the media crimes bill is the most blatant example of the government 's steady encroachment on media freedom in an effort to establish a media monopoly and stifle freedom of expression , " said the unclassified intelligence report , dated august 3			1
the @entity7 government denies that the media crimes law and the closure of the radio stations are related and maintains that each initiative was grounded in @entity7 law			1
" as usual , much disinformation has shaped the debate surrounding these developments , " the @entity7 @entity59 said in a fact sheet about the developments			0
at the same time @entity6 was extolling these two measures , supporters of his government attacked the @entity70 television studio , one of few remaining networks that gives a voice to the opposition			2
in the august 3 attack , more than 30 members of a pro-government party threw tear gas at the studio and injured three people			0
the leader of the attack , ardent @entity6 supporter @entity83 , was arrested			0
@entity6 condemned the incident , but last week , people alleged to be among his supporters attacked a group of journalists who were passing out leaflets in the street			0
the leaflets that journalists from the private media conglomerate @entity93 were passing out criticized an education bill that they said would hamper press freedom			0
according to local news reports , a group of assailants threw the journalists to the ground and kicked them , sending 12 to the hospital			0
the intelligence report coincides with numerous critical statements against @entity6 by press freedom organizations			1
" the harassment ( of journalists ) is a permanent condition , " @entity105 , @entity106 program coordinator for the @entity107 , told @entity0			0
the shuttering of the radio and television stations and media crimes law are part of a larger strategy that @entity6 has followed since he was briefly deposed in a coup in 2002 , he said			1
@entity6 's goal can be described as a three - point strategy , @entity105 said : to control the flow of information , stop critical reports and disseminate pro-government propaganda			0
much of the pro-government propaganda comes through @entity6 's use of state - owned media outlets , critics say			1
the media crimes law in particular was an escalation from previous measures aimed at the press , @entity105 said			1
@entity6 has used the media as a scapegoat , the intelligence analysis said , but " he may be willing to give this up in order to clamp down on the negative news reporting and commentary , which have been hammering away at the country 's economic problems and @entity6 's increasing authoritarianism for the past year			2
" the media crimes law met resistance from the @entity144 and was tabled for the time being because of opposition to it			1
@entity6 's government defended the draft of the bill , as well as the recent closure of the broadcasters , as being within the law			2
the radio stations that were ordered off the air were all violating the law , either by operating with expired broadcasting concessions , failure to renew such licenses or illegally holding a concession , the @entity7 government 's fact sheet said			1
according to the document , " neither the regularization of the situation of radio and television ( stations ) that have been operating outside the law in @entity7 , nor the development of a law to clearly regulate subsequent imposition of liabilities in the case of serious media abuses are measures that limit freedom of speech in @entity7			1
" @entity6 's intervention with the press is also worrisome because of @entity6 's influence over other leaders in the region , including the leaders of @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 , @entity0 was told by @entity187 , chairman of the @entity189 's @entity188 and @entity190			0
" freedom of expression in general , for everyone , is under attack in these countries , " @entity187 said			0
" they all have a deep , abiding distrust of journalists and freedom of the press			0
" @entity184 president @entity199 was only days behind @entity6 in seeking to close radio stations for technical infractions , @entity187 said			1
@entity6 " has clearly been alienated by a free press and has seen it as a threat and a target , " he said			0
not only journalism advocacy groups have been vocal against @entity6			0
the @entity207 this month released a statement expressing concern about the closure of the radio stations			2
" there can be no freedom of expression , or even democracy , in the absence of media pluralism , " @entity207 secretary - general @entity212 said in a statement			0
the divisions over the media measures run deep , both locally and internationally , but on a trip this week to @entity184 , @entity6 continued to pitch his plans to other leaders			2
he has faced strong opposition before , and he has weathered it .			0
