@entity0 -- @entity0 's public schools mirror many of the problems of inner city life : gang activity , drug infestation , poverty , low academic achievement and a dismal graduation rate			1
within the past year , the school system has undergone a comprehensive and sometimes harsh reorganization in hopes of changing that reality			2
" our 54 % graduation rate was the major catalyst , " said @entity14 , chief of transformation for the @entity16			0
the school system closed 16 schools in 2010 , and there are more changes to come			1
the school board recently voted to offset a projected $ 74 million budget deficit by closing seven more public schools and laying off 702 employees , including 643 classroom teachers			1
closing schools is hard on the community , school leaders said , even if it 's better in the long run for financial stability and students ' educations			1
" i closed my alma mater , " @entity14 said			2
" it was n't producing			2
" her school , @entity38 , had about 800 students , although the building could handle about 2,000 , @entity14 said			2
the graduation rate was about 30 %			0
but 12 schools throughout the @entity43 are restarting with the help of the federal government 's @entity45 , which could bring more than $ 36 million to @entity0 schools over four years			1
in 2010 , the federal government provided $ 546 million for about 1,000 low - achieving schools across the @entity50			2
districts could use the money to reorganize or close down schools completely			2
@entity56 school 's turnaround wins @entity58 's attention in @entity0 , school officials chose to use a reorganization model for several of their schools , including @entity62 and @entity64 high schools			1
to receive the funds , they had to replace the principal and rehire no more than half the school 's staff			1
although the academic numbers for the year have n't been analyzed yet , officials at both high schools said they 're on the right path			1
as part of the reorganization , both schools were divided into smaller academies , each with its own principal and teachers inside the same large building			1
the smaller academies allow school personnel to keep better track of students , which officials say has led to a decrease in school violence			1
" @entity62 last year was one of the schools that stayed in the media because of gang violence , " @entity14 said			1
for this school year , " we actually have an 83 % decline in terms of serious incidents that are happening in the building , " said @entity91 , one of three principals at @entity62			2
" that includes number of suspensions			0
so , it directly impacts our attendance			0
" and attendance affects how students learn			0
" you ca n't be sporadic in your attendance and think that you 're going to turn on the light switch and it 's just going to work , " @entity62 principal @entity104 said			1
principal @entity109 echoes that sentiment			0
" ( students ) are in class , which is different from last year			0
they are paying attention in class , and they are getting the work done that the teachers are asking them to do , " she said			2
at @entity62 last year , there were often six or seven police cars in the parking lot in order to manage school violence			1
" our police officers , who used to come last year because of the violence that may go on outside , are here now to control traffic			2
... there 's no fights out there , " @entity104 said			2
across town at @entity136 there 's been a similar drop in violence			1
" a lot of people thought because of the different schools coming to @entity64 there would be a lot more			2
it 's actually been a lot less , " senior @entity144 said			0
@entity64 principal @entity147 attributes part of the improvement to the smaller academy system			0
" when you 're trying to manage a campus , a comprehensive high school , there 's no way possible you could learn 1,100 kids , " she said			1
" on my floor now , i have roughly 400			0
i know my 400 kids			0
i know them by face , i know them by name , i know the parents			0
" @entity162 , president of the @entity163 , said there are pros and cons to replacing half of the staff at public schools			1
" one of the benefits of the 50 % replacement that i 've seen is now that we 've got staff in these buildings from other schools , they are sharing strategies they believe worked at their previous school , and a lot of teachers are saying ' ok , let me try that strategy , ' " @entity162 said			1
on the downside , it takes time for the staff to become a team			0
" all of their principals are kind of learning their staff at the same time			0
that 's one of , i think , the biggest downfalls of replacing 50 % of the staff , replacing the principal and expecting immediate , good results , " @entity162 said			0
closing schools and shifting teachers and students around is not an easy task , even if the school is considered a failure			1
when they were working on the transition plan , @entity14 said , it was a challenge to convince parents that it was best for children			0
parents were willing to overlook a building that was falling apart and school that was in academic trouble			1
" it was almost as if some parents said ' i know the school is failing , i know it 's raggedy and falling down , but the people there love my child			1
i am comfortable sending my child here and this is ok , ' " she said			0
@entity64 's @entity221 said it was disheartening that the state report card did n't reflect teachers ' hard work			1
under the reorganization , she said , teachers are still working as hard as they did before , but now they are working smarter			1
principal @entity228 , who oversees ninth - graders at @entity64 , said he initially lost his job in the @entity0 schools overhaul , but was rehired in a different role			1
" the plan has nothing to do with the adults			0
and it should n't , " he said			0
" it 's all about the children and what is best for the children			0
" the children seem to be adapting just fine			0
when the students in @entity245 's 10th - grade biology class were slicing up an onion to look at under a microscope , they were n't thinking about the major transition in their school system			1
they were more concerned with drawing what they saw and learning science			0
" if you see air bubbles , you should draw air bubbles , " @entity245 told them as they peered into microscopes			0
" but i also want to see the onion underneath			0
" for all the improvements , there 's a lot more work to come , @entity14 said			0
" while those schools are able to do some major changing and reforming , " she said , " that 's 12 ( schools ) out of a hundred			2

@entity0 is working to transform its failing public schools
the district has closed several schools and laid off hundreds of teachers
academic statistics are n't in , but school leaders say there 's less violence on campuses
