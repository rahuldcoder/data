-- @entity1 has told @entity0 that cricket has helped the @entity5 - chasing @entity4 team recover from their darkest hour			1
as the co-hosts prepare to square off against rivals @entity10 in the @entity5 final on saturday , the batsman said the terror attack unleashed on his team in @entity14 two years ago is never far from their minds			1
@entity1 was one of six @entity4 players to be injured when masked gunman fired on the team bus in @entity20			1
six police officers and two civilians were killed in the attack			0
though the events of 2009 will never be forgotten , the 33 - year - old says the team have moved on as they eye their second @entity5 triumph			1
@entity1 told @entity0 : " once you go through an episode like @entity20 , i think you always do think about it			1
" i mean i wish that is something no one has to go through but i think the @entity34 team has moved on after that and playing cricket has helped us to do that as well			2
" the final is to be held in @entity40 which has also been blighted by terror			2
a co-coordinated shooting and bomb attack in 2008 killed 164 and injured over 300			2
but @entity1 says @entity4 will be focused firmly on cricket on saturday			1
he said : " security is always important and there are experts to handle that so we let them do their job and we accommodate that and we try to focus on the game and what we can control -- that 's the only thing we can do			0
" even for a cricket - mad region the hype surrounding the final has gone into overdrive , with the co-hosts set to battle it out at the @entity58 in front of a huge television audience			2
@entity1 says @entity10 and @entity4 were destined to meet each other			1
" i do n't think anyone scripted it better than this , it 's absolutely fantastic , " he said			0
" i mean you work so hard for quite some time to get to this situation and you know you 're just one step away from being @entity70			0
" @entity1 and his teammates will have to brave a fierce atmosphere inside the stadium but he says @entity4 want to repay their own fans for " brilliant " support throughout the tournament			1
" we have a different way of celebrating our cricket with a lot of music , a lot of dancing and a rich culture in that as well , and that goes down to our school cricket as well , " he explained			0
" when you have a big game , you have these bands playing , lots of music , lots of rhythmic moves where all the cricketers , even on the field , we feel that rhythm , so we had that in @entity98 for the quarterfinals , the semifinals , the entire group stage , all the stadiums were fully packed for each of our games , so the @entity34 fans have done their bit -- it 's up to us now			0
" as one of @entity4 's experienced players @entity1 says it is vital he and the other veterans of the team help to ease any nerves the younger stars have been feeling since the semifinal success over @entity114			1
" we wanted them to enjoy the moment as well because these kinds of moments do n't come our way very often but at the same time , especially playing in @entity10 , there will be a lot of distractions , a lot of people want to know how you 're doing and at the same time , there 's a lot of things happening in @entity10			0
are you going to the @entity5 ? go to @entity128 to send video and photos			0
" definitely , i think once you play in a final you know how to absorb that pressure and how to try to control things better			0
there are already about five or six guys who have already done that at the highest stage so hopefully the nerves will be calmer			0
