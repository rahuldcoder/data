@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 boasts quick check - ins , free , accessible parking and a convenient baggage claim			1
that 's not surprising , considering that fewer than 20 people fly out of the facility on any given day			0
and all three scheduled daily departures to @entity11 have a stop in @entity13 , @entity1 , only 35 miles away			0
but the airport offers a special treat as the end of the year approaches -- free sightseeing flights			1
thanks to a @entity22 program that gives small regional airports millions of dollars if they can reach a certain level of passenger traffic , the @entity0 , @entity1 , facility tries its best to get 10,000 passengers off the ground by the end of the year			1
for @entity29 , that meant she and her grandson @entity31 got an " awesome " bird 's - eye view of @entity0 and neighboring @entity33 , @entity1 , from a chartered @entity34 757 last december			0
" they were trying to meet the quota , and they were 300 passengers short , " said @entity35 , who saw an ad placed by the airport advertising the free flights			1
since the difference between 10,000 and 9,999 is the difference between $ 1 million and $ 150,000 in federal funds , airport managers in @entity0 and other small towns do whatever they can to get over that number			2
in @entity50 , @entity51 , residents get to take aerial tours of the city 's christmas lights for $ 15			2
in @entity56 , @entity57 , residents got free 10 - minute flights to reach the local airfield 's goal of 10,000 passengers			2
sen. @entity61 , an @entity63 @entity62 who is a frequent critic of federal spending , said " about 40 " airports are believed to offer similar flight programs to reach the threshold , which was set by @entity69			1
@entity61 is asking the @entity22 and the @entity70 , the investigative arm of @entity69 , to come up with a definitive figure			1
" the whole purpose for that is n't to say what you 're doing is illegal -- it 's probably not -- but to have a more cogent policy that truly represents the needs based on enplanements for every airport , " @entity61 said			0
he said federal support for small airports like @entity0 's " should be earned in terms of grant process , " not by gaming the system			1
" we created the incentive to kind of weasel on it so you can get more money , and it 's exacerbated now because of the economic downturn , " @entity61 said			0
@entity0 is about 200 miles west of @entity11 and about 110 miles south of @entity94 , @entity57 , where most area residents catch flights when they travel by air			0
but airport director @entity98 said an economic benefit analysis said the facility contributes about $ 395 million into the local economy , " so i definitely think there 's no question that we need this airport			0
" in addition to the $ 1 million based on passenger traffic , the @entity0 airport got $ 30 million to lengthen its runway in 1999 and another $ 1.6 million from the @entity112 administration 's economic stimulus bill in 2009			1
local students get free flights to @entity11 for school trips as well , @entity98 said			1
and the airport just got another $ 150,000 grant from the @entity22 to promote itself			1
@entity98 said the money is needed to meet @entity22 mandates for security , runway paving and safety , and he 's proud of what the facility has achieved -- particularly for students			2
" we 're trying to introduce aviation to them at a young age , so they can look at it as a career , " he said			0
" a lot of these kids have never had the chance to fly			0
we 've been able to share that opportunity , and the kids love it			0
" but @entity61 said at least five airports have used " creative ways " to keep the money flowing in and has managed to get support for a congressional investigation to find out how airports like @entity3 can get so much money for so few passengers .			2
