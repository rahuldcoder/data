-- just within the past week , a disturbing video released by the hacktivist group @entity2 exposed details surrounding the alleged sexual assault of a teenage girl in @entity6 , @entity7 ; more protests erupted over the horrific gang rape of a young woman in @entity11 ; and the final sessions of the 112th @entity13 did not reauthorize the @entity14			0
whether it 's here in the @entity18 , or in other parts of the world , violence against women persists and justice often falls through the cracks			1
the @entity6 rape case has come back into the spotlight due in large part to online activists who felt that it was n't being taken seriously			0
while the case against two teenage football players is being investigated , with a trial set for february , we as a society must do all we can to end sexual violence against women			1
the video footage and messages that surfaced on social media , which appear to depict the sexual abuse of a girl , highlight horrible attitudes and unacceptable behaviors toward women			2
one thing is clear : those " bystanders " who were present on the night of the alleged rape bear a responsibility			0
why did n't any one of them assist her or respond to what was happening ? and while three members of the football team have come forward to testify in the case , more should have			0
the " code of silence " that is often found among athletes , fraternities and other similar groups must be addressed			1
we call upon our athletic teams and coaches to speak up because they can play an important role in prevention			1
coaches can educate young men about the need to treat women with respect , encourage healthy relationships with the opposite sex , and promote non-misogynist behavior			1
we must ensure that young men see sexual violence against women as despicable and do all they can to stop it			1
according to a recent national survey , 1 in 5 women in the @entity18 reported having been raped			1
most rapes are perpetrated by someone the victim knows			0
victimization can start early in life			0
we still live in a culture where young women are not given a voice and victims of sexual violence are sometimes not believed			1
opinion : why do n't some boys see it as rape ? the @entity7 incident has sparked outrage since it first was reported			2
advocates and community members were glad that the case was turned over to special prosecutors in the @entity7 attorney general @entity98 to avoid potential conflicts of interest			0
when @entity102 reporter @entity102 took up the story in september , it inspired people who had been sexually assaulted to come forward about their own experiences			0
these people know that they were no longer alone			0
fewer than half of @entity7 's 88 counties have rape crisis services available for individuals who have been sexually assaulted , and many existing programs lack the adequate resources to provide needed prevention and community outreach to address the myths about sexual violence and promote a culture that supports rape survivors			1
in @entity6 , there is no prevention funding to address sexual violence			2
as for survivors , how can they seek justice and healing if they have little support and resources available ? we call upon house speaker @entity128 -- who 's from @entity7 -- to help us end sexual violence			2
opinion : end culture of rape in 2013 the @entity14 includes provisions for engaging men and boys as allies to ending sexual violence , providing bystander intervention and prevention in high schools and on college campuses			2
contact your @entity13 member and encourage him or her to reauthorize the @entity14			0
survivors and communities across @entity7 and the nation deserve your support			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity151 and @entity152 .			1

@entity151 , @entity152 : in the @entity18 or *abroad* , violence against women persists
they say there 's often a " code of silence " among athletes and fraternities
@entity151 , @entity152 : athletic teams , coaches should educate boys about respecting women
