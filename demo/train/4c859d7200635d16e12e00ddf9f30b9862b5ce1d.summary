-- why not use those last few vacation days ? given an average of 14 annual vacation days , @entity2 left four days on the table over the past year , according to @entity7 's 13th annual vacation deprivation study			1
that 's twice as many as the previous year			2
" no one retires wishing they 'd spent more time at their desk , " said @entity9 , @entity7 's vice president and general manager , in a statement			0
" there are countless reasons that vacation days go unused -- failure to plan , worry , forgetfulness , you name it			1
but rested employees are more productive employees , so taking regular vacations may well help the company more than failing to do so			0
" workers around the world cite a variety of reasons for not using those days			1
some 25 % say they like to stockpile days for possible trips in the future			2
other reasons include difficulty of scheduling vacations ( 22 % ) , getting paid for unused days ( 18 % ) , worry they ca n't afford a vacation ( 16 % ) and failure to plan ( 15 % )			1
but 8 % point the finger not at themselves and instead at the atmosphere of their workplaces , saying they resist using their allotted days off because taking vacation days may be viewed negatively			1
these figures and more were determined by @entity45 , which conducted this survey online from august 20 to september 12 in @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and the @entity50			2
in all , 24 countries were included , and 8,535 working respondents over age 18 took part			0
people had to be employed full time , part time or be self - employed			0
@entity2 are n't the most vacation - deprived citizens			0
that honor goes to both @entity60 and @entity61			0
@entity61 take seven out of 10 vacation days , while @entity60 workers take seven out of 18 vacation days			1
worldwide , working people get an average of 20 vacation days			1
the @entity71 top the scale in vacation days , getting 30 off each year and -- get this -- taking all of them			1
even so , 90 % agree with the phrase , " i feel vacation deprived " despite the fact that they and other @entity48 get more vacation time than most others			0
even though they have fewer vacation days than the @entity71 , some 59 % percent of @entity2 feel vacation deprived			1
@entity80 are much less likely to pout about their lack of vacation time : seventeen percent say they feel vacation deprived			0
fewer than half of those from the @entity85 ( 41 % ) , @entity86 ( 39 % ) and @entity87 ( 38 % ) feel the same way			0
once people do vacation , how successful are they at letting go ? nearly half of those surveyed say they leave work behind " as soon as i leave on vacation , " while 20 % do when they arrive at their vacation destination			2
only 10 % can " never " truly relax while away			0
yet 67 % of @entity2 remain connected to their offices via e-mail or voice mail , they say			0
more than 90 % of @entity71 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity87 travelers stay connected			2
that so many @entity71 workers stay connected to the workplace while away may -- or may not -- serve as consolation to others .			1

americans will not use four vacation days this year , study says
workers worldwide get an average of 20 vacation days
workers in @entity71 get 30 days and use all of them
