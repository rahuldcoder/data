-- the @entity1 has a simple answer for critics who claim the league should have been able to get videos of @entity6 knocking out his future wife and dragging her out of an elevator			1
it would have been illegal , commissioner @entity9 wrote in a memo wednesday to the top officials of the @entity1 's 32 teams			1
" once a criminal investigation begins , law enforcement authorities do not share investigatory material ( such as the videos here ) with private parties such as the @entity1 , " he wrote in a note to chief executives and club presidents			2
" in addition , ( @entity24 's ) @entity23 excludes material that is generated in the context of an active law enforcement proceeding			2
" the @entity28 , however , reported wednesday that a law enforcement official said he sent a copy of the video in april to an @entity1 executive and someone called him from an @entity1 office phone to thank him for sending the video			1
the @entity1 reacted to the story by saying the league is unaware of anyone in its office having the video in their possession and officials would look into the report			1
@entity1 toughens domestic violence policy with six - game bans @entity6 has been suspended indefinitely from the @entity1 and was cut by the @entity47 after a video surfaced this week showing him punching @entity49 , who at the time was his fiancee , in an elevator in @entity52 on february 15			1
@entity6 was eventually charged with third - degree assault by @entity55 prosecutors , but as a first - time offender was able to enter into a diversionary program			0
if he successfully completes the program in one year , the charge will be removed from his record			0
timeline of events in the @entity6 story critics have said the @entity1 should have been able to get the videos and should have banned @entity6 for life instead of initially giving him a two - game suspension			1
the ban was increased after the in - elevator video was posted online by @entity70 on monday			1
it was the second dramatic video in the case			0
the first showed the aftermath of the ferocious blow			0
in it @entity6 drags his unconscious fiancee off the elevator and talks to a security staffer			0
@entity9 does n't rule out a return for @entity6 @entity9 also said the hotel could n't legally provide the video to the @entity1 because of the investigation into the incident			1
" we did not ask the @entity52 casino directly for the video , " he wrote			0
" again , our understanding of @entity24 law is that the casino is prohibited from turning over material to a third party during a law enforcement proceeding , and that doing so would have subjected individuals to prosecution for interference with a criminal investigation			1
" @entity9 said the @entity6 legal proceedings are still an " open matter			1
" @entity1 's past penalties for domestic violence ' a different story ' @entity70 executive producer @entity103 told @entity0 's " the lead with @entity106 " on tuesday that they paid for the videos			2
" i think what happened was the casino closed			0
and when the casino closed , i think there were a lot of employees who just said , you know what : ' we want to do the right thing			0
' and ultimately we ended up getting this video because when you look at the video , clearly you see the @entity1 did not do the right thing , " @entity103 said of the second video			0
" and i think at a point somebody said that the gain here is worse than the risk , in terms of doing what 's right			0
" the @entity128 closed eight days ago			0
the @entity129 petitioned for the release of the elevator video under the @entity132 , but its request was denied by @entity24 officials			2
what if @entity9 ran the @entity136 and @entity137 captained the @entity1 ?			2
