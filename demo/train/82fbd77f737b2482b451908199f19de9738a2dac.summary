others said @entity75 need to set an example of tolerance to the rest of the world			0
" it would be giving in to bigotry and intolerance to demand that it be moved and i think in the end , it makes us less safe because we need to show the world that we are a tolerant , open society , " supporter @entity80 said			0
lt. col. @entity89 , an @entity90 reservist preparing to head to @entity91 , agreed , saying developers have " the right and the ability to do it wherever they would like			0

@entity142 said there is no local , state or federal statute that prevents the construction of the facility			2
