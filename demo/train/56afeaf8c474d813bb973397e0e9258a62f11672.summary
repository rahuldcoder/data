-- four days after the death of @entity4 , the digital innovator and blazing intellect , why are millions of strangers on the internet still mourning as if some essential part of us has died ? the answer is simple : it has			1
we can understand -- but of course not fathom -- the grief of @entity4 's loving parents , of his friends and of people like me who were privileged to have known @entity4 over his short years			1
to understand the depth of feeling among those who never met @entity4 , we have to get past the convenient pegs the media have used to explain his story			2
for example , the media like to shorthand @entity4 by calling him a " hacker			1
" yes , if by " hacker " we mean what software developers generally intend by the term : an exceptionally clever person who can make anything out of anything			0
to the general public though , it means a " black hat " who violates laws to get at protected information			2
@entity4 was a builder , not a hacker in the black hat sense			1
the list of the projects he contributed to is prodigious , as is appropriate for a prodigy who at the age of 13 anticipated the concept of @entity48 and at 14 was being consulted by senior technologists about a standard to ease the flow of content across the @entity2			0
tech : how @entity4 helped build the internet that was just the start			2
@entity4 went on to make serious contributions to @entity58 ( an organization that releases licenses so authors can let their work be more easily reused ) , @entity63 ( a public library of online works ) , @entity66 ( an immensely popular open discussion forum ) , @entity68 ( a simple way to write web pages ) , web.py ( making it easier for developers to create web applications ) , @entity75 ( type - and - post website ) and much more			1
but you ca n't explain the @entity2 's grief simply by referring to @entity4 's unearthly technical prowess			1
you may notice a pattern in the projects @entity4 worked on : they 're about making it easier to share information on the @entity2			2
that 's what got him in trouble with a reckless prosecutor who wanted to put him in jail for 35 years for downloading millions of academic research articles from a provider -- @entity93 -- that puts no limits on how many articles subscribers can download and that did not want to prosecute him			1
earlier , @entity4 had participated in making public court records much more readily available online			2
yet it would be a mistake to peg @entity4 only as a liberator of information for the public good			1
he also built services to enable social interactions around information and ideas , because that 's how ideas have effect in the world			0
@entity4 had a deep sense of the internet as the site of a new culture of ideas , connection and play			0
but it would also be a mistake to peg @entity4 simply as a champion of social connectedness			2
he was that , but he was also a hardheaded fighter for justice			0
he was acutely aware of the advantages conveyed by accidents of birth : country , race , class , gender , sexuality and more			0
access to information and to one another were , to @entity4 , tools in the struggle to lessen the world 's raw unfairness			1
@entity4 's suicide sparks talk about depression still , thinking of @entity4 mainly as a software activist is one more peg we should undo			1
the world has rarely seen an intellect as voracious and comprehensive as @entity4 's			1
he was a seeker after first causes and had the mental prowess to plow through massive amounts of information and ideas , simultaneously considering the data , the pragmatics , the theory , and the theory of theory			0
his insight helped inspire @entity162 's @entity161 - based anti-corruption campaign ( @entity163 ) and two groundbreaking progressive grass - root organizations ( @entity165 and the @entity166 )			0
from these platforms , and with his remarkable skills as a writer , he was able to play a crucial role in alerting the net to the dangers of the @entity173 that would have given the government more power to shut down sites at the blink of the content industry 's stink eye			0
put this together and you still do n't have that which the @entity171 is mourning			0
@entity4 did n't just contribute ferociously to the @entity171			1
it was n't just that he was persecuted out of all proportion for trying to contribute more			0
above all , he embodied what is best and hopeful about the @entity2 : its endless information , its ethos of sharing , its joy in connecting friends and strangers , its unflinching transparency about its own limitations , its promise -- by no means yet delivered -- of a world that is more open , more knowledgeable , and , above all , more fair ... a world that reflects the values of the internet at its best			1
that is why the @entity2 is so wracked with sadness			0
that is why we will never forget @entity4			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			0

@entity206 : with @entity4 's suicide , something essential about the @entity171 has died
he says @entity4 not just " hacker " but *prescient* prodigy who made huge contributions
he says *zealous* prosecutors wanted to jail him , but he saw information as public good
writer : @entity4 embodied what is best about the @entity171 -- sharing , connectedness , promise
