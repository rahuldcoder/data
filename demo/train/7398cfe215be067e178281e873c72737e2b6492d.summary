-- @entity1 is looking forward to the " ultimate challenge " of trying to win the @entity3 after again proving her dominance over biggest rival @entity6 and defending her @entity9 title on sunday			1
the @entity10 triumphed 6 - 1 6 - 4 to retain her no. 1 ranking and claim the 50th @entity13 crown of her career , becoming only the 10th player to do so			1
the 31 - year - old is the only player to have won on three different colors of clay -- and she is confident that the @entity9 surface 's reversion to red after the blue of 2012 will help her bid to end an 11 - year wait for her second grand slam success at @entity3			1
" this court is definitely different from last year , " @entity1 said			1
" it definitely plays more like @entity3 , so i think that 's a plus			1
it 's a little slower than it was last year and plays more like a true clay court			2
so i think it 's great preparation			2
it 's a good start in the right direction			0
" last year @entity1 fell at the first hurdle in @entity37 -- a tournament she won back in 2002 -- before going on to triumph at @entity39 , the @entity40 , the @entity41 and the season - ending @entity42			1
" it is the ultimate challenge , " @entity1 said			2
" whether i reach it , i do n't know			0
i 'm not going to put that pressure on myself			0
" i wanted to do it last year and i did n't get it			0
so this year i 'm just looking forward to @entity49 , and then after that @entity3			2
" @entity1 has now beaten second - ranked @entity6 in their past 12 meetings , and was in control for most of the match despite trailing 3 - 1 in the second set			1
" i do n't know if her start was shaky , but i felt i played well in the first few games -- playing such a great athlete and great tennis player like @entity6 , you have to come out and play well			2
i had no choice , " she said			0
" she definitely started playing better in that second set -- i think she came out with a different game plan			0
i missed a very crucial point in that first game , but after that i just had to refocus			0
" @entity1 is now three wins behind @entity68 on the @entity13 list , but a long way behind @entity72 's record 167			1
" i do n't know how many more i can win			0
like i say every day , ' who knows if i 'll ever win another title ? ' i just want to live in the moment , " said @entity1 , who returned to action in 2011 after a long injury break that caused life - threatening blood clots on her lungs			1
" i feel like every moment i play -- i do n't know if it 's because of what i went through -- i feel like i 'm so fortunate to be out there and healthy and to have an opportunity to play a sport and be really good at it			0
" hopefully i can just keep it going			0
" @entity6 arrived in @entity49 having retained her @entity89 title , but the @entity90 was once again unable to stand up to @entity1 ' power			1
" obviously it 's tough losing in the final today , but i think my preparation so far has been decent , winning a title in @entity96 and getting to the final in this tournament for the first time , " the 26 - year - old said			1
" one more tune - up to go before @entity3 , and everything seems to be going well			2
" @entity102 is in fine shape to defend his @entity3 title after winning a record - extending 23rd masters level tournament in @entity9 on sunday			1
the @entity106 crushed @entity108 15th seed @entity107 6 - 2 6 - 4 in the final to claim his fifth crown since returning from longterm knee problems in february			0
the 26 - year - old joined @entity113 in equal second on the @entity116 clay titles list with his 40th success on the surface			0
they are six behind @entity120			0
@entity107 can take some consolation in that he will return to the top - 10 rankings for the first time since 2008			0
it was @entity102 's third title in @entity9 , where he has been runner - up twice .			1

world no. 1 @entity1 beats @entity6 in final to retain @entity9 title
@entity10 *notches* up 50th win of her career , becoming the 10th woman to do so
@entity1 is hoping to win the @entity3 for the first time since 2002
@entity102 wins the @entity9 men 's title for the third time
