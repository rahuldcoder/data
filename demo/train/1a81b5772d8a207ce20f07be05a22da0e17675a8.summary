@entity0 -- when @entity4 president @entity3 flew to @entity0 this week for a state visit , he brought along a lot of baggage -- and it 's not his country 's famous @entity8			1
@entity3 left @entity4 amid sinking popularity ratings and swirling reports that he cheated on his partner of seven years with a younger movie actress â € ” making this week 's trip something of an escape for the embattled president			1
the former @entity4 first lady @entity18 -- whom @entity19 said in november he was looking forward to hosting -- is n't coming to the @entity20 now that @entity3 has announced their split			1
@entity4 president 's alleged lover nominated for acting award he says his private life is private , but @entity3 's not denying the affair			1
now he 's in @entity28 solo for one of @entity0 's most tradition - bound events , where protocol dictates nearly everything and a slip - up , however unlikely , could wind up offending a top ally			1
@entity19 and @entity3 : a strong alliance " the protocol that dictates how state visits are handled is something that 's steeped in hundreds of years of history , " said @entity36 , a former chief of staff to @entity37 who helped plan state dinners			1
over time , formal arrival ceremonies and high profile press conferences have become a part of the multi-day affair			0
finding ways to accommodate foreign leaders , even those with " it 's complicated " relationship statuses , is just another aspect of the highly choreographed state visit , said people with experience organizing them			2
it 's not the first time a @entity4 president has come to @entity0 alone			1
@entity3 's predecessor , @entity59 , attended a formal dinner at the @entity20 shortly after announcing his split from his wife			1
and at least @entity3 is showing up ; when @entity65 's president @entity64 caught wind of @entity68 spying , she canceled altogether			1
" there are so many changes that take place , some that are more prominent in the news than others , " said @entity69 , who until august was the @entity28 chief of protocol			2
" you have to be flexible , you have to be prepared , and you just sort of change course			0
" but questions such as who will sit next to @entity19 are still up in the air			0
typically the partner of the visiting head of state gets the chair next to @entity28 's president			1
when that position is vacant , @entity28 officials must consult their counterparts and even have the president himself weigh in			2
it 's not necessarily a hard task , said @entity36 , because plenty of people would jump at the chance to sit next to @entity19			0
the designee does n't have to be @entity4 , though it would n't be unexpected if he or she is			2
it 's just another piece of planning that requires painstaking attention to detail			0
" i 'm sure that they will have an imaginative way of doing their seating that 's absolutely appropriate , " said @entity69			0
it may seem antiquated to treat a guest so gingerly , but state dinners have always been about formality and gentle manners			0
they 've grown so much that they no longer fit in the @entity112			0
instead a sturdy white tent on the @entity114 holds the hundreds of invited guests , who usually include some top donors and key allies in @entity118			0
this year they 'll take trolleys from the @entity121 down to the structure			0
no detail spared for @entity4 president 's arrival at the @entity20 once there they 'll dine on four courses of @entity28 - grown haute cuisine â € ” osetra caviar and quail eggs , a winter salad " served in a wonderful glass bowl to make it look like a terrarium , " @entity137 - raised beef , and a chocolate dessert sourced from @entity19 's native @entity139			1
on monday the @entity20 released the names and vintages of the wines poured at each course â € ” a change from the last few state dinners , which listed only " @entity28 " bottles lest the price tag shock taxpayers			2
reds from @entity149 and @entity150 , and a sparking wine from @entity152 , are the selections			0
none retail for over $ 50 a bottle			0
it 's a much - sought - after invitation -- so much so that a @entity152 couple faked one to attend @entity19 's event honoring the @entity160 prime minister , @entity159 , in 2009			0
@entity162 's red - and - gold sari is likely forever imprinted in the mind of @entity164 , the former @entity20 social secretary who stepped down shortly after the incident			2
that kind of glaring fissure in the evening 's decorum is n't typical , said @entity36 , who did recall an incident during a visit by the @entity172 premier she said was marred when a journalist shouted a question at the formal arrival ceremony			0
and while the details still matter for staunch allies like @entity4 , a slip - up on protocol is n't likely to throw the @entity28 ' now - solid relationship with the country into jeopardy			1
@entity4 , to the @entity19 administration 's pleasure , has taken a more interventionist stance in global conflicts , a turnaround from the days when @entity28 responded to @entity4 's opposition to the @entity190 invasion with boycotts of @entity4 ( or just @entity4 - sounding ) products			1
" let 's just say that we 've come a long way from @entity196 , " was how one senior administration official described the relationship monday			0
in @entity198 @entity4 took a leading role in the mission that ended with @entity202 's death			2
and in @entity204 , @entity4 troops are working to prevent @entity205 from taking over in the northern part of the country			2
@entity4 was ready in september to launch air strikes in @entity209 as @entity19 was trying to rally support , making the country one of a few foreign allies to back the @entity28 plan after @entity215 's parliament voted against it			1
@entity19 eventually went to @entity118 for approval , but the issue never came to a vote			0
while @entity3 , like most other @entity221 leaders , has expressed outrage at allegations of @entity68 spying , the dust - up is n't likely to make any major dent in @entity4 - @entity28 relations			1
the same can be said for what @entity3 calls " tax evasion " by @entity28 - based tech firms ( after @entity0 , the @entity4 president heads to @entity229 )			1
@entity3 , a socialist elected in 2012 , is more closely aligned in policy with @entity19 than the center - right @entity59			2
his fluency in @entity236 might make him an easier dinner companion than his predecessor , as well as a more conversant travel buddy on the trip to @entity242 's @entity241 the pair took monday			0
not up for discussion ? his love life			0
opinion : why the @entity4 president needs @entity247 @entity4 president says it 's over ; first lady leaves residence @entity4 president meets with @entity251 amid scandal @entity1 @entity20 producer @entity253 contributed to this report .			1
