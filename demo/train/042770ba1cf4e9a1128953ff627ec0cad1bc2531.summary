a @entity11 lawmaker then shook @entity8 's hand			1
" may @entity14 help you , " he told him , according to the @entity13			0
he will likely need all the help he can get			0
@entity8 will inherit the political reins of a country deeply divided along sectarian lines , a split that has aided a brutal campaign by extremist @entity23 fighters with the @entity24 in @entity6 and @entity25 , which refers to itself as the @entity24			1
so who is the man that world leaders , diplomats and @entity6 hope can hold the country together ? on paper , @entity8 politically resembles the man he will replace			1
like @entity9 , he is a member of the @entity33 , one of the country 's biggest @entity11 political blocs			1
like the man he 'll take over from , his power base is with @entity6 's majority @entity11			2
and just like him , he was forced into exile by @entity42 and he returned to @entity6 after the @entity23 dictator was toppled in the @entity45 - led 2003 invasion			1
