-- a first half goal from @entity2 gave @entity3 a shock 1 - 0 win over 10 - man @entity6 at the @entity8 on friday to throw @entity9 wide open			1
@entity6 suffered an early blow in @entity11 when leading striker @entity12 was sent off for his second yellow card , shortly before @entity2 fired @entity3 in front			1
@entity15 then saw his second half penalty , given following a handball by @entity18 , blocked by @entity3 goalkeeper @entity19			1
the result was perennial challengers @entity6 's first defeat at the group stage of a @entity8 tournament since 1986 , when then - @entity6 were beaten by @entity25			1
that year , the three - times world champions went on to reach the final			0
it also marked the latest setback for the tournament 's traditional giants following @entity33 's win over @entity34 and @entity36 's win over @entity37			0
@entity39 coach @entity38 admitted it was a big setback for his team			0
" we had a lot of problems , the double yellow card for @entity12 , they got the first goal , then we failed to score from the penalty spot -- all in all it was difficult to come to terms with all this , " he told @entity49			1
" we 're devastated of course but i 'm still confident we will go through to the last 16			0
we have our fate in our own hands still and a good goal difference			0
" the result lifts @entity3 's chances of qualifying from group d following their 1 - 0 defeat by @entity61 in their opening game			2
they are now tied with @entity6 on three points following the @entity39 ' 4 - 0 win over @entity66			0
a win for @entity61 over @entity66 on saturday would put the west @entity69 side firmly on course for a place in the last 16 -- while a win for @entity66 would leave all four teams tied on three points match winner @entity2 turned in @entity75 's header from close range following good work down the right by the impressive @entity79 on 38 minutes			1
two minutes earlier , @entity6 had been reduced to 10 men when @entity12 picked up his second yellow card of the game for a clumsy challenge on @entity84			1
@entity12 , who is chasing @entity87 striker @entity86 's record of 15 goals in @entity8 tournaments , had earlier been booked for catching @entity92 's ankles , and suspension will now rule him out of @entity6 's final group game against @entity61 on june 23			1
but @entity12 appeared to be a victim of some fussy refereeing by @entity98 official @entity97 , with seven other players also picking up bookings for minor offences			0
@entity6 came close to equalizing in the last minute of the half following a series of corners when @entity106 slammed a shot against the bar but @entity3 's defenders scrambled away the rebound			2
@entity3 , one of @entity113 's most impressive sides in @entity8 qualifying , had seemed happy to concede possession and defend deep in the early stages with @entity39 midfielders @entity106 and @entity118 struggling to find space in the center			2
@entity15 flashed an early volley wide of the @entity3 goal and @entity123 combined neatly with @entity124 on 30 minutes to play in @entity12 , but the @entity39 striker was called offside before putting the ball into the net			1
@entity3 's main threat came from @entity79 down the right , with @entity130 and @entity131 both picking up bookings for fouls on the @entity135 midfielder			0
@entity136 went close from the second of those , clipping a freekick from the edge of the penalty area just wide of the post			0
@entity6 pressed hard for an equalizer early in the second half and looked to be back in the game when @entity3 defender @entity18 was punished for a handball in the penalty area in a virtual repeat of the incident that saw his side concede a penalty in their opening defeat by @entity61			2
but @entity15 's low shot was solidly blocked by goalkeeper @entity19 diving to his left			1
@entity15 had already twice gone close , flashing a shot across the goal from @entity118 's defense - splitting pass and then shooting into the side netting after being set up by the same player			0
@entity3 almost increased their lead on 66 minutes when the ever dangerous @entity79 cut in from the left to set up @entity2 but the striker 's low placed shot bounced to safety off the inside of the post			2
@entity75 then glanced the top of the bar with a header , again from a cross from the right by @entity79 .			0

@entity39 striker @entity12 sent off for second yellow card
