it was hot , but not live , and @entity54 tweeted that " people are leaving the awards show in droves right now during @entity40 and @entity38 clip # @entity58			0
" hit : @entity61 's opening monologue the comic hosted this year 's ceremony , and he killed			2

after declaring " i do n't look at myself as a female rapper ' cause i know what i do , " she went on to offer that " when you hear @entity80 spit , @entity80 wrote it , " which some took to be a diss directed at new rapper @entity95			1
