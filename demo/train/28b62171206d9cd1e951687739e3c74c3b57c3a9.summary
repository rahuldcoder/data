-- she had the most memorable entrance of any character on " @entity4 " so far			1
just as @entity6 was about to be set upon by a herd of walkers , a shadowy figure dispatched them -- with a @entity11 sword			1
it was one of the standout moments of the season two finale , and we would soon learn that this person 's name was @entity18 , a quiet warrior who had seemingly mastered how to survive in the zombie apocalypse ( one bright idea : bring along a couple of chained walkers with no hands or mouths to draw away the others )			1
ever since that moment , @entity18 , played by @entity26 , has been rivaled only by @entity27 in terms of rabid fans			1
at times , she is a silent force of nature , but has opened up a good deal to the rest of the survivors lately			0
the season 's midway point having ended with ( spoiler alert ! ) a brutal attack on the prison , sending the group off in different directions , not to mention the horrifying death of @entity44			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity26 about what fans can expect when the season returns on sunday			1
@entity0 : @entity18 has been through a lot already			1
where is her head after the attack at the prison ? @entity26 : it was deeply trying for her and a major loss for her			1
the idea of finally connecting with people -- that 's not easy for her at all			1
she 's very guarded and really has serious armor on			2
she 's slowly letting that armor chip away , opening up to people			2
she actually spent some time being in this community full time , so to have this happen under her watch , and to see all the trauma it causes , and the things she was trying to avoid , is very traumatic to her			0
she 's still just starting to invest again in people			2
she has suffered great loss and it 's a question of how she responds to it			2
there are a couple of ways it could go down			0
we 'll have to see which road she takes			0
@entity0 : she lost a good friend in @entity6 last year , and now more loss			1
does she still feel a connection to this group ? would you describe her as very loyal ? @entity26 : even in the first episode this season , you see how she 's very connected to @entity84 , bringing him comic books and candy			1
there are tons of little moments between her and @entity27 as well			0
in terms of her opening up to the group , she 's become very connected			2
yes , she was very loyal to @entity6 , very loyal to the people with whom she goes outside of the prison			0
she risks her life for them			0
she actually really wants the best for these people			0
most recently , she did n't run away , she went back to make sure that @entity99 was n't killed by the governor			0
@entity0 : where are things headed for the rest of season four ? is there a big difference from the first half ? @entity26 : it 's gon na be a very different tone			1
you see people going in different directions , you do n't know who 's going to align with whom , who 's going to make it			2
it 's going to be a whole different tone from what 's been done before on the show			2
it 's going to be very exciting and thrilling , and no one knows what 's coming next			2
there will be very powerful moments , and very powerful character developments			2
@entity0 : did you have to learn any different forms of fighting or different stunts this season ? @entity26 : i always like trying out different things			1
there are always ways that the writers will write something that will allow me to attack it in a different way			0
absolutely -- we try to make things a little different than they were last time			0
there 's always that journey i 'm taking with the physical demands of the character -- i want to do as many different things as i can ! @entity0 : this show has a very passionate fan base , and there is certainly a big fan base for @entity18 in particular			1
does this still surprise you ? @entity26 : it 's a worldwide thing now			1
i was in @entity156 and there were fans there who would stop me on the street			2
it does still take me aback how much the show has resonated across culture , class and creed			0
@entity0 : any interesting fan moments lately ? @entity26 : the one that comes to mind most immediately are two different guys who have me tattooed to them , so that was a little shocking and unexpected			1
i 've seen about three now like that			0
@entity0 : do you think @entity18 can be seen as someone to look up to , or do you try to play her that way ? @entity26 : what you have to do as an artist is invest your character with as much life and dimension , and stick to what 's written			1
you stay true to that -- you do n't think " let me make this character someone to look up to			2
" i do n't know how to play that			0
all you can do is function in the character that 's been crafted			1
however she resonates , i just have to go with that			0
you really ca n't bank on that			0
the beauty of the show is that -- and i share this with her -- we 're not people pleasers			0
and the writers are amazing , so they know exactly how to give her a story that 's rich -- we have wonderful conversations and i 'm able to collaborate with them in terms of what they 're going for , and i give my all to that fiction			0
@entity0 : what has been the toughest scene for you so far ? @entity26 : shooting the @entity44 death scene was very difficult emotionally for us			1
that was definitely way up there			0
@entity0 : do you own an action figure of @entity18 ? @entity26 : i get given them , i do n't go out and buy them			1
there 's been a lot of stuff lately , so i do n't know if i 've kept up with it ! the initial stuff that came out , i definitely have most of it			0
i 've given away some of it			0
@entity0 : was it interesting to see yourself as an action figure ? @entity26 : it was , it was ! the first time i got the model -- it was very different and unexpected			1
it was n't something i thought of in acting school			0
it was pretty darn cool ! " when i get into the world , i want to have an action figure ! " i never dreamed that dream , but to see it was very cool .			1
