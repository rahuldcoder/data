@entity0 this is n't how @entity3 speaker @entity2 wanted to start 2015			1
he 's presiding over a historic majority in the @entity3 while the @entity5 is controlled by @entity6 for the first time in nearly a decade			1
but the @entity8 @entity6 is still wrestling with a familiar problem that could threaten his agenda over the next two years : conservative unrest			0
that dynamic was on display tuesday when a surprisingly large group of @entity6 voted against giving @entity2 a third term as speaker			1
" i think a lot of @entity6 are looking for a new direction , " @entity19 rep. @entity18 , one of those saying he 'll back another candidate , told @entity1			0
this group , which includes about a dozen lawmakers , is almost certain to fail			0
but even if they do n't block @entity2 from another term wielding the speaker 's gavel , their opposition is a fresh reminder of @entity2 's struggles to control his rank - and - file just as he and incoming senate majority leader @entity34 try to prove that @entity6 can govern heading into 2016			1
and the drama is all playing out amid turmoil in the leadership ranks after revelations that @entity3 majority whip @entity39 once spoke to a white supremacist group , unfortunate news for a party that is trying to expand its reach to minorities ahead of the next presidential election			1
although he already got the nod to keep his post by the @entity48 after the midterms in november , @entity2 does n't officially get the gavel again until a majority of members vote for him on the @entity3 floor on tuesday			1
if 29 @entity19 members vote for someone else , they can force a potentially embarrassing second ballot -- with the scene playing out on live @entity60 cameras			0
the opposition movement is n't entirely unexpected			0
two years ago , @entity2 faced a similar , poorly organized effort when a dozen @entity3 @entity6 backed other candidates or declined to vote for him			1
some @entity2 opponents say their position is n't personal			1
they just do n't like the way he ran the @entity3			1
" this is n't about @entity2 , " @entity18 said			1
republicans looking for an alternative " just want to make sure that we 're doing the right thing on behalf of our constituents			0
" @entity74 rep. @entity73 and @entity76 rep. @entity75 , who are tea party favorites , announced they would run for the speaker			0
in an interview on @entity1 monday , rep. @entity79 of @entity80 floated @entity76 rep. @entity82 as another possible candidate			0
but even @entity18 conceded no one can defeat @entity2 outright			1
@entity86 @entity85 rep. @entity85 told reporters he opposed @entity2 not because he was n't conservative enough , but because he failed to give members enough input into legislation like the massive spending bill that passed in december			1
conservatives were angry that the bill did n't do anything to block president @entity96 's immigration executive order			0
@entity85 estimated there were between 10 and 50 @entity98 who could back an alternative to @entity2			2
still , he said he was only confident that those who have publicly announced they opposed @entity2 would actually follow through and vote for someone else on the @entity3 floor			1
@entity85 declined to tell reporters on monday night who he was supporting			0
@entity108 rep. @entity107 , another conservative @entity2 critic , told reporters monday he was still deciding who to back and was hoping he and others trying to force a change in leadership could agree on a " consensus candidate			1
" @entity2 's allies say they are n't worried about him losing his job and @entity19 members across the ideological spectrum left the first meeting of all @entity3 @entity6 on monday night predicting the speaker would be re-elected			1
even @entity74 rep. @entity121 , who told @entity1 he did n't always support @entity2 , said he thought the speaker would overcome the challenge , and that he deserved a chance to shepherd a conservative agenda through a new session			1
at a time when @entity19 leaders want to turn the page on the dysfunction that has dominated @entity132 , this latest effort feeds into the familiar narrative that played out over the past four years that @entity2 ca n't control his conference			2
" this is a last moment sideshow , " rep @entity135 of @entity19 , a @entity2 supporter , told @entity1			2
he added : " the sad thing is it distracts from what our messages ought to be			0
we ought to be talking about the @entity6 agenda -- about the possibilities now that we have the @entity5 -- about @entity145 , about fixes on @entity147 , trade regulatory reform			0
" @entity148 , a spokesman for the speaker , said @entity2 is " confident he 'll remain the speaker			1
" indeed , @entity2 has laid a groundwork for being re-elected			2
he reached out individually by phone to @entity3 @entity19 members after the midterms and was the party 's top fundraiser in 2014 , collecting chits along the campaign trail			2
according to his political staff , the speaker brought in over $ 100 million over the 2014 cycle , and traveled extensively for members and candidates , attending 150 events			0
in monday evening 's meeting in the @entity132 basement , @entity2 did n't specifically address his critics			2
but he made a general pitch to his fellow republicans on the need to stay united in the new @entity172 , according to several @entity19 members who attended the session			0
he noted his party had a real opportunity to get some of their top priorities done if they worked as a team			0
still , some outside groups are trying to whip up a grassroots campaign to get conservative activists to call in and demand members vote against @entity2			1
@entity184 , a group with strong tea party ties , is part of this effort , but @entity2 supporters say this group and others who have been critical of the speaker have a history of seizing on internal feuds to raise money			1
@entity2 slammed some of these conservative groups out after the 2013 government shutdown , arguing they are more concerned with their elevating their own profile than helping the @entity19 govern effectively			1
@entity202 rep. @entity201 , who did n't vote for @entity2 in 2013 , would n't say how he would vote on tuesday			1
but he appeared to criticize the @entity204 forces for not standing up and saying they wanted someone else earlier this fall			0
" we had an election for speaker in november and no one opposed @entity2			1
i find it hard to believe that those folks who really do n't like mr. @entity2 today suddenly discovered they did n't like him between november and today , " @entity201 said			2
in addition to his own political problems , @entity2 is also opening the new @entity172 grappling with a scandal caused by a top @entity6 ally			2
@entity217 rep. @entity39 , the third ranking @entity3 @entity19 leader who is tasked with counting votes , admitted last month he spoke to a white supremacist group in 2002			2
@entity39 apologized and renounced the group , which has ties to former @entity223 leader @entity222			0
@entity2 stood behind him calling him a " man of high integrity and good character			2
" but some @entity6 outside @entity172 are calling on @entity39 to step aside , to prevent any damage to the party 's efforts to diversify its supporters			0
@entity3 @entity231 are already using the @entity39 story -- targeting 30 @entity98 in competitive districts and challenging them to publicly say whether or not they support him remaining in his post			2
@entity3 press secretary @entity236 , asked monday whether @entity39 should stay , took a jab at the @entity19 , saying who @entity6 choose as their elected leaders " says a lot about who the conference is and what their priorities and values are			2
" he also repeatedly noted that @entity39 had referred to himself as " @entity222 without the baggage , " but said it 's up to @entity98 on who they elect as their leaders			0
as the former chair of a group of influential @entity3 conservatives , @entity39 is viewed as @entity2 's bridge to those on the right , so any effort to push him out could hurt the speaker at a time he needs to hold conservative support to keep his own job			1
for now , @entity39 seems poised to remain in the leadership			0
republicans are facing high expectations as they take full control of @entity172			0
many @entity3 @entity19 members and outside groups are saying they expect many items -- such as changes to banking rules , @entity147 , environmental regulations -- that @entity231 blocked to sail through now that @entity272 is in charge			0
that might be easier said than done since @entity5 @entity6 will still have to rely on @entity276 votes to overcome filibusters and pass legislation			0
@entity280 @entity279 sen. @entity279 , who is a close personal friend of @entity2 's said the speaker will have to guide @entity3 members to concentrate on things that are doable			1
" i think he has to tap down unrealistic initiatives and focus people on the tools we do have , " @entity279 told reporters , mentioning using spending bills to strip away money for programs or limit the @entity289 's actions			0
@entity1 's @entity295 , @entity296 and @entity297 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 is facing conservative opposition but is still expected to win
