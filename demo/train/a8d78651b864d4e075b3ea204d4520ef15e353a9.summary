almost every day for the past month , a crowd of curious onlookers has gathered in northern @entity3 to gawp at three mysterious structures			2
measuring 2.5 meters tall high and 1.7 meters wide , the large plastic blocks look like little more than oversized liquorice candy or a confusing attempt at surrealist art. appearances can be deceiving			2
according to @entity11 , the @entity12 company behind the project , these innocuous black objects are stage one of what will eventually be the world 's first @entity16 printed house			1
it is made using a " @entity24 " machine , a giant , custom - made version of a desktop 3d printer that produces a material 10 times thicker than normal			0
the finished structure will take the shape of a 13 - room canal house made from scores of separate but interlocking components ( like the three currently on show )			1
" these rooms will be structural entities on their own			0
we will then place them on top of each other to make a house , " explained @entity11 co-founder and director , @entity34			1
" originally , we had the small printers in our office and we were printing scale models with them			0
then we thought why not print it ( the full house ) right away , " she added			1
how does it work ? the interior and exterior walls of the house are printed at the same time with spaces left in between for electric wiring and pipes			1
these spaces are then filled in with concrete for insulation and reinforcement			0
as it stands , the primary material being used is a bio-plastic made from 80 % plant oil but other substances are being tested for their suitability			0
between six and ten blocks are required to make one room and the entire process of printing and assembling the house is estimated to take three years			1
according to @entity67 , the @entity3 project is an experiment to test out the feasibility , challenges and cost implications of fashioning a house in this way			2
" if you print in plastic you can recycle the materials , " @entity67 explained			0
" we also see the possibility to design something , send it digitally and then print it exactly in the place that you need it rather than transporting everything to the location			0
" on top of this , houses can be custom designed to suit individual owners tastes , moved piece by piece to a new location if required before being put together again and only the precise amount of material required would need to be used , reducing waste in the process			0
@entity94 even sees the possibility of building furniture , arts and crafts into the blocks that make up a @entity16 printed home			1
the canal house will feature a printed block containing a staircase			1
but while the potential benefits of building a house in this manner may be appealing , there remain many challenges before the technology is proven effective from a structural , living and economic sense			1
a note of caution @entity94 is clear that the final costs of the project are still unknown and admits that 3d printing is unlikely to replace existing house building techniques any time soon			1
others , however , doubt whether the concept has any long term value at all			0
according to dr @entity124 , managing director of @entity121 - based @entity16 consultancy and research firm , @entity122 , printing a house takes longer and runs counter to existing building techniques which are already relatively efficient			1
" a lot of housing projects are using very modular systems of building where things are built in a factory off site , bought and then assembled very quickly , " @entity124 said			2
" this is counter to that			0
it 's about much longer times on the building site			1
" @entity124 also points out the difficulty of altering wiring between walls or correcting faults as they arise after they have been insulated with concrete			0
yet despite these potential drawbacks , @entity67 and her colleagues remain hopeful the idea can provide benefits to the architecture and construction industries if the initial @entity3 project is successful			0
" i do n't think we 'll print all homes through 3d printing in future but i think it can be an additional , valuable tool to what we already use , " @entity67 said			2

@entity12 architects are building what they claim is world 's first @entity16 printed house
the 13 room canal house will take three years to construct
some experts question whether this is an efficient way to build new homes
