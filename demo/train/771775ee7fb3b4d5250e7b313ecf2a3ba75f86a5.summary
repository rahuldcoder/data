@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 lives in a small house in @entity0 , @entity1			0
she 's a full time psychology student at @entity5 and she is single - handedly raising 3 girls aged 9 to 14			1
their smiling faces are framed in photos on the walls at home -- the only ornaments in an otherwise sparsely decorated house			0
an emotional @entity14 said her daughter 's arrest made her world crumble like a pack of cards			1
but there is one family member missing from these photos : the oldest sister , @entity21 , now 21 , in prison in @entity23 charged with smuggling heroin			1
" my life , my world is crumbling like a pack of cards right before me , " @entity3 told @entity2 in an emotional interview			0
" @entity21 has never given me any cause to worry			1
" over the course of a 90 - minute interview with @entity2 , @entity3 frequently broke down in tears			0
at one point , she collapsed to her knees and begged for her daughter 's release			1
but @entity3 is clearly baffled and mystified as to how her daughter ended up in @entity23 in the first place			1
@entity40 was born in @entity41			1
her family sent her to @entity43 , @entity44 , to live with her aunt when she was 8 years old to escape the political strife back home			1
by many accounts , @entity21 was a happy and popular child			1
she achieved good grades and excelled in biology , hoping to become a surgeon			0
" a really nice child , who loved school , good friends , respected the staff , behaved herself and achieved good academic results , " recalls school headmaster @entity52			0
" we 're extremely surprised , " he says , " we 've had some of her ex-friends get in touch with the school saying ' what do you know ? ' well , we only know what the media has told us and what 's now coming out			2
and everybody is in the same boat			0
@entity21 could n't be involved in drugs , could she ? " @entity3 describes her daughter as quiet , petite and " fragile			1
" her daughter never mentioned any boyfriends and did n't smoke or drink , she says			1
in fact , @entity21 's life was so trouble - free that when her mother and three sisters eventually moved to @entity0 , @entity1 , the family decided that she should stay with her friends and school in @entity43			1
friends say she was popular and outgoing , but that she also had an adventurous streak			0
her former classmate @entity82 describes a fun - loving girl with a passion for travel			0
" the thing about @entity21 is that she likes to travel and do new things , " she explains			1
" she 's very funny , like extremely funny , the weirdest sense of humor , very articulate , very hard working			2
" but the last time @entity82 talked to her friend was in june last year			2
she did not mention any plans to go overseas			0
in fact , @entity21 was planning a holiday , says her mother			1
@entity3 last talked to her daughter in july when she was traveling with friends in @entity97			2
but @entity21 did not mention any details about who she was traveling with or where she was going next			1
in august @entity21 was arrested at the @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity23 , allegedly in possession of 1.5 pounds of heroin -- an offense punishable by death			1
how did @entity21 end up here ? @entity3 does n't know			1
@entity108 consular officials contacted her sister , the aunt who raised @entity21 , in september , informing the family that she was in jail			2
when @entity3 discussed it with her sister , both women dismissed it as impossible			0
" i just did n't believe it			2
it was totally out of character			0
" she told us , " i thought it was her passport that someone else was using			0
and i was furious that @entity21 had lost her passport or given it to someone else			2
" it was n't until january that @entity108 consular officials contacted @entity3 directly and confirmed that the woman inside the @entity127 prison in @entity23 was indeed her daughter			1
and the nightmare got worse : she was told @entity21 was five months pregnant			1
" i 've not been able to comprehend it			0
@entity21 ? arrested ? five months later she is pregnant ? " she says			1
" because it 's like a puzzle			2
i 'm still trying to figure out how she got there			0
i have not been able to figure that out			0
suddenly , she 's pregnant			1
" @entity82 and other friends have rallied to her side and support groups have sprouted across the @entity139 -- hoping public pressure will lead to her release			0
there is a glimmer of hope : the @entity23 government said @entity40 will no longer face the death penalty , because @entity23 law does not allow the execution of a pregnant woman			1
also , a new prisoner transfer agreement signed thursday between @entity23 and @entity108 may allow @entity21 to serve her prison term here in @entity108			1
" it is good news that she might be able to come here and if she 's found guilty and has to serve her sentence here , at least i can visit her because where she is no one can visit her , " said @entity82			2
" she 's a strong person			2
she has a strong character			0
she can defy any odds			0
" but for @entity3 , the ordeal is not over yet			0
she still fears that conditions in the @entity127 prison may be too harsh for her daughter			2
" technically , they have n't killed her by firing squad			2
they have killed her the other way around			0
because they can never give her the care she needs			0
because the circumstances of the pregnancy , the psychological torment she 's going through			0
" @entity3 says she is waiting for her @entity1 passport			0
she then hopes to travel to @entity23 and see her daughter before her trial starts , possibly as early as next week .			1
