-- i did n't know anything about " @entity3 " going in -- somehow missed the trailers , interviews and tv spots that must have been out there			1
all i knew was the cast : @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , which seemed like a good start			1
@entity9 narrates the movie , takes no time at all to declare his @entity18 town the best place in the universe and proudly introduces himself as the manager of a certain warehouse store that i wo n't name here ( but which must have swallowed up half the budget , judging by the constant name - checking )			1
then , weirdly , the movie ditches the focus on @entity28 ( @entity9 ) and stays with the store 's night - shift security guard , a guy called @entity32 who 's celebrating becoming a @entity34 citizen by helping himself to a little vodka and " @entity36 " on a dozen high - definition tv screens at once			1
and suddenly , there 's green gunk everywhere			0
what on earth 's going on ? what kind of @entity9 movie is this ? these are legitimate questions , i think , but neither director @entity46 ( from " @entity47 " and " @entity48 " ) nor screenwriting team @entity50 and @entity51 of " @entity52 " and @entity53 can muster entirely convincing answers			1
the basic plot : @entity28 forms a neighborhood watch committee to solve the @entity32 mystery , enlisting three misfit volunteers to the cause and soon enough comes face to face with the kind of illegal alien you 're more likely to meet in a @entity64 horror movie			2
in other words , this is your typical buddy comedy sci - fi paranoia thriller -- a lot like " @entity70 " and a bit like " @entity72 , " which @entity50 starred in and " @entity52 's " @entity74 directed -- but with less in the way of quirky charm and a whole lot more jokes about male genitalia			1
anyone who saw " @entity52 " knows the phallus looms large in @entity50 's and @entity51 's comic imagination			1
but that movie was about hormonal adolescents			2
apparently the specter of the penis is not diminished in the minds of middle - aged men			2
@entity28 is , in his words , " shooting blanks , " and ca n't bring himself to admit it to his ovulating wife ( @entity91 )			0
his partner in crime - busting , @entity93 ( @entity10 ) , is equally obsessed with the condoms he sees his teenage daughter 's boyfriend buying			1
as for the polite @entity100 who joins them , @entity99 ( @entity12 ) , he just wants to join in a community activity -- and fantasizes about the sexual rewards that may accrue to a local hero			0
that leaves @entity106 ( @entity11 ) , a dropout who failed to measure up in the eyes of town cop @entity110 ( @entity112 ) , and who 's willing to put on a dress and go all the way with a suspicious neighbor ( @entity116 ) just to prove his manhood			2
these are all funny guys , and they do their best to make up for a slapdash script that must have taken all of a weekend to toss off			0
but @entity46 shows his inexperience by playing everything for laughs			0
another director might have given us scares and suspense as well as these infinite riffs on emasculated men pretending to be cops			0
the movie has one exceptional sequence , though it froze the smile on my face			2
@entity28 has killed his first extraterrestrial , and the guys decide to take photographic evidence -- a ritual that immediately descends into sexual simulation			0
it 's a goof on the infamous @entity143 photos , a moment of jet - black satire that 's both subversive and tasteless			0
it 's also much toothier than anything else in this flaccid movie .			0

" @entity3 " stars @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11
movie is " your typical buddy comedy sci - fi paranoia thriller , " *reviewer* @entity152 says
@entity50 and @entity51 from " @entity52 " are among the screenwriters
