-- september 12 is always the day that reminds us that the war may never end			1
september 11 , each year , is the day for somber commemoration and prayers for those who were lost			2
september 11 is the date that lives in history			2
but as each september 12 dawns -- this year on sunday -- we realize anew that the uncertain slog continues , that the year ahead will be one in which unseen and hazily defined enemies continue to wish ill on a @entity13 that , in 2001 , dedicated itself to a war on terror			1
most wars eventually come to a close			0
this one , by its very nature , will not			0
one evening in the weeks after september 11 , 2001 , i was having dinner with @entity24			1
there is no @entity13 who has had the life that @entity24 has : a @entity29 fighter pilot who flew 59 combat missions , and who then returned to the skies in the @entity33 to fly 90 more ; the first @entity13 astronaut to orbit the @entity36 and the greatest national hero of his era ; a @entity13 senator for 24 years ; at age 77 the oldest man ever to leave the @entity36 's bounds as he returned to space aboard the shuttle @entity44			1
in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks , with an injured and angry country hungry for retaliation and victory , @entity24 , who had turned 80 , was realizing something before most people did			1
" all the other wars we had , " he said , " the object was to win the battlefield			0
use tanks , use planes , take their capital , and declare victory			0
this is like the wind			2
this is like fighting the wind			1
. you can hit them , but they 'll pop up somewhere else			0
this does n't seem to be the kind of war where you can look forward to them signing a surrender on the battleship @entity75			2
" he was referring to the end of @entity80 's involvement in that war began on december 7 , 1941 , and ended less than four years later on the september day in 1945 when @entity82 signed its surrender aboard the @entity75 in @entity84			1
by the ninth anniversary of the beginning of @entity88 , the victory had long since been won ; the surviving soldiers were home and raising families ; the terrible times were all past tense			0
nine years after the war on terror began , though , there is no end in sight , and even if there was , who exactly could sign a surrender ? in the first days of the war on terror , then - @entity13 secretary of defense @entity101 , perhaps inadvertently , put his finger on it			1
speaking to reporters , he said : " i 've therefore characterized this conflict , this campaign , this so - called war , as being notably different from others			1
" this so - called war			1
nine years ago the country went into what we were told was wartime footing			2
but unless you were a member of a family with a son or daughter , a father or mother , a brother or sister serving in the military , here at home it was n't always easy to figure out precisely what that entailed			0
nine years ago , the @entity128 moved into @entity13 airports when the terminals finally reopened to passengers ; the guard 's saturation presence ended soon enough			1
curbside baggage check - in was done away with because federal officials believed it provided an opportunity for terrorists ; that decision , too , was soon reversed as the airlines complained that it was hurting their business			2
the nation seemed uncertain of the appropriate rules in this new kind of war			1
it is largely forgotten now , but there were serious suggestions that salad bars be shut down because they were convenient targets for terrorists wanting to poison the citizenry			0
for a while a phrase from @entity88 -- " for the duration " -- re-entered the language , but that , too , soon disappeared when it became evident that the duration would most likely have no endpoint			0
life went on even as the war went on			2
last week , a @entity162 survey reported that 67 percent of @entity13 now believe that it is unlikely that the @entity13 will ever capture or kill @entity164			0
the subject of his capture , once a part of daily civilian conversations , seems to have been increasingly pushed aside			0
and so as another september 12 arrives we enter the tenth year of a war like no other			2
few among us would be optimistic enough -- or foolish enough -- to declare that placid times are just around the corner on this planet we all share			0
the anger in the world , especially during weeks like the one just past , does not feel as if it has cooled			0
when the rhetorical heat becomes especially fervid , i think of something else that @entity24 told me during that dinner			1
he was remembering the day in 1962 when he had looked out the window of a capsule hurtling through blackness and took in a sight that no @entity13 eyes had ever seen : the @entity36 , from the vantage point of space orbit			0
he recalled his thoughts with a combination of wonder and sadness			0
" you look down , " @entity24 said , " and you think about all the borders you fly over			1
you fly by those borders so quickly , and you think of all the things that people do to each other because of those borders			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			1

after commemorating 9/11 , we realize war against terror never ends , says @entity204
he says the nation 's immediate war footing ended soon after 9/11
@entity204 says battle continues against unseen , ill - defined enemies
@entity24 said , " this is like fighting the wind "
