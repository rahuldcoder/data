-- to create the future of @entity4 cuisine , chef @entity1 looked to the 16th century for inspiration			1
during a year - long odyssey to discover the origins of @entity4 's classic dishes , the 40 - year old chef tracked down food historians and visited auction houses across the country to bid on dusty , leather - bound tomes that held the secrets of traditional recipes and long - forgotten ingredients			1
" i wanted to find the roots of recipes and what the original idea was behind them , " he says			0
" i realized i could talk for hours about @entity4 products , but i could n't think of any ( @entity4 dishes ) that would stand at the same level			2
" the spark for @entity1 's desire to improve and update @entity4 cuisine was a month spent working in the kitchen of @entity28 with @entity29 , the culinary wizard who is often called the world 's greatest chef			1
" he changed my way of thinking , " says @entity1 , who first began his own epicurean education after dropping out of university to work in the kitchens of @entity36 restaurants			2
from @entity40 in the east to @entity42 in the south , @entity1 racked up 60,000 kilometers on his journey that also led him to the country 's best farmers and food producers , many of whom are now suppliers for @entity1 's award - winning restaurant in @entity53			1
" many of them were n't aware of how great their products were			0
i took their enthusiasm and passion and added it to my cooking			0
some of them struggled to keep up the standard that i needed , but they 're growing with me , " he says			0
@entity63 has been open for less than a year but became the first @entity4 restaurant to gain a " @entity65 " , indicating that @entity1 is on the right track in his quest to elevate @entity4 cuisine to a new international standard			1
@entity1 puts an emphasis on ingredients and reconstructing dishes from their essential elements , putting him in a similar mold as celebrated " food scientists " like @entity29 , @entity77 's @entity76 or @entity78 of the @entity80 restaurant noma that was recently voted the world 's best restaurant for the third straight year			1
at @entity86 , classic recipes like hare in cream are reimagined -- " we cook it for 72 hours at 65 degrees , so its more like fois gras or butter and is eaten with a spoon " -- while the kitchen is also a lab in which to experiment with @entity4 ingredients hardly used anymore like chokeberries , wild herbs and edible flowers			2
as @entity4 becomes more interested in their culinary culture , @entity1 believes the time is now right for @entity4 to takes it place at the table of internationally respected cuisine			1
" we 've spent 20 years ( since communism ) catching up in every department of life -- getting good jobs , starting companies , getting mortgages			0
now it 's a new country and people are starting to say , ' what about @entity4 products and our traditions ? ' " we ca n't be amazed anymore by pizza or some @entity115 dishes			0
we are ready to search for our products and be proud of them			0
" send in your best photos and videos of @entity4 outside of the country attitudes to @entity4 food have been slowly improving , says restaurateur @entity123 , the @entity77 owner of @entity36 's @entity125 restaurant and bar			2
" old school perceptions that its all potatoes and cabbage are being revised , but there are still suspicions , " he says			0
" in soups and stews @entity4 cooking is equal to or greater than other cuisines , and generally quality is improving , but for restaurants it can still be a bit tricky finding quality produce like charcuterie and supply lines are not great			0
" even if @entity4 gastronomy does n't challenge cuisine like @entity146 food as an international phenomenon , @entity1 hopes his restaurant can do for @entity4 food what @entity149 has done for @entity152 cuisine			1
" compared to @entity80 , @entity4 is much more diverse , so if we are wise and careful about promoting @entity4 cuisine ... we can be one of the most influential and really big cuisines like @entity115 , @entity156 and @entity157			1
there 's lots of work to be done , but i think its going to happen			0
