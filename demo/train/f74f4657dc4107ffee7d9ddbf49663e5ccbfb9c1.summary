-- clashing priorities of jobs versus the environment are provoking questions about how far the nation should go to promote clean energy alternatives like solar and wind power			1
" the actual debate happening in the @entity13 is not hard to understand , " wrote @entity9 on the @entity11 's blog			0
" we 're having an argument about whether doubling - down on fossil fuel extraction or promoting efficiency and renewal energy would be better economic policy			1
" each side has its experts			0
on one hand , economists at the @entity24 believe large - scale investment in clean energy would create about three to four times as many jobs as the same money would in fossil fuel industry			1
on the other hand , expanding development of oil and natural gas resources would create 1.1 million jobs and $ 127 billion in government revenue by 2020 , according to a new @entity39 study cited by the @entity40			1
those numbers could benefit the nation 's budget and some of @entity13 's 14 million unemployed			2
@entity44 of the @entity45 summed up his stance in an editorial for the @entity49 political web site , @entity50 : " it 's time for @entity13 to develop an energy policy based on reality rather than ideology , grounded in what works rather than in hopes and dreams			1
" as political pressure rises inside the @entity59 to slash unemployment , @entity58 -- a former member of the @entity59 -- says she doubts now whether president @entity67 is " seeing the opportunity for job growth within some of these clean energy standards and policies			1
" defending @entity67 's environmental record , @entity59 spokesman @entity68 pledged the administration " will continue to take steps to meet the president 's important goals of protecting the health of our families , increasing our nation 's clean energy generation , reducing our reliance on foreign oil , and supporting @entity13 industries and innovation			1
" criticism of @entity67 's clean energy initiatives resulted in the resignation of an administration energy official this week after solar panel maker @entity88 -- which got about a half billion dollars in federal loan guarantees -- went bankrupt			1
on thursday , @entity67 defended government help for clean energy companies because they 're " part of that package of technologies of the future that have to be based here in the @entity13			1
" the president said @entity100 and @entity101 are outpacing the @entity13 in clean energy because their governments are offering incentives			1
many smaller @entity13 clean energy companies , he said , find it difficult to find private investors			2
@entity110 ' gut check time ' for @entity67 ? nonetheless , environmentalists say they 're worried about other clean energy issues			2
the @entity113 is poised to decide later this year whether to approve a permit for a @entity116 company to build a new oil pipeline from @entity118 , @entity116 , to @entity119 , which supporters say will increase jobs and energy independence			2
in a move last month that angered much of the environmental community , @entity67 decided to delay implementing @entity127 rules limiting smog from vehicles , power plants and factories			0
business leaders applauded the decision , saying the rules would have killed jobs			0
poll : alternative energy trumps fossil fuel so , what do @entity13 think ? most ( 63 % ) say developing alternative energy sources should be a higher priority than expanding fossil fuel exploration and production , according to a @entity144 study			1
for so - called " main street republicans , " that number is 66 %			0
less than half ( 48 % ) of all @entity13 believe global warming is a proven fact caused mostly by cars , power plants and factories , according to a @entity0 / @entity154 poll			0
for self - described independent voters , that number is 38 %			0
" there 's really no evidence at all that most people see a conflict between environmental protection and job creation in fact in many ways they see them going hand in hand , " said @entity158 pollster @entity157			0
as for @entity169 politics , @entity67 is unlikely to lose many votes over his environmental record , @entity157 says , because most environmentalists will find themselves with few acceptable alternatives			0
@entity67 's 2012 @entity175 rivals include candidates who doubt that climate change is real and who favor eliminating the @entity127			0
what @entity67 does risk is voter turnout and enthusiasm -- key factors that helped him win in 2008			0
to what extent will clean energy advocates try to convince their friends , relatives , co-workers and colleagues at the water cooler or at cocktail parties or barbeques that they ought to vote for the president ? " i think many of them will , " says @entity157			2
" the question is , how many of them will ? and i think that is influenced to some extent by the administration 's policy decisions			0

*refiners* urge energy policy " based on reality "
economist : clean energy investments create more jobs
study : expanding fossil fuel industry would equal 1.1 million jobs by 2020
@entity59 pledges to take steps toward " clean energy generation "
