-- @entity1 ruined @entity3 ' 100th appearance for @entity4 on friday as the planet 's 87th - ranked team held the no. 1 side and defending @entity9 champion in a qualifier for next year 's tournament in @entity12			1
@entity13 defender @entity3 became the eighth player from his country to reach the milestone , and duly put his side ahead with a header from a corner four minutes into the second half in @entity21			0
@entity1 's dogged defending had frustrated @entity4 's intricate passing game , and the visiting side scored a shock equalizer in the 79th minute as @entity25 got behind the defense to slot in @entity29 's low cross			1
the draw extended @entity4 's unbeaten run to 19 matches , but left @entity34 's team second in @entity35 behind @entity36 ahead of tuesday 's trip to @entity38			1
only the top nation will automatically qualify from the five - side group , with the runner - up hoping to go into the playoffs			1

with away fans banned in @entity74 due to ongoing tensions , @entity72 took advantage of a mistake by @entity78 to score the opening goal and fellow striker @entity80 sealed @entity61 's fourth win in five matches			2
it put the @entity84 second on goal difference behind @entity86 , while @entity87 moved above @entity64 into third place with a 2 - 1 win over @entity90			2

@entity137 beat bottom side @entity138 to be four points further back in fourth place			0
@entity140 stayed top in @entity142 without kicking a ball , as @entity144 moved up to second on goal difference above @entity146 after their respective one - goal wins away to @entity149 and @entity150			1
@entity152 's hopes of automatic qualification from @entity154 suffered a big blow as @entity157 's team needed late goals from @entity159 and @entity160 to draw 3 - 3 in @entity161			1
the result left @entity161 second above the @entity163 on goal difference , with both teams four points adrift of @entity166 -- whose match in @entity169 was postponed until saturday due to heavy snow			0
@entity171 moved three points clear of @entity173 at the top of @entity175 after winning 3 - 1 against the previously undefeated 2004 @entity177 champions , with two goals from striker @entity179			1
third - placed @entity181 's hopes of a second successive @entity9 appearance were dented by a 1 - 1 draw with @entity184			0
@entity185 and @entity186 set up a crunch group h clash on tuesday after contrasting wins			0
