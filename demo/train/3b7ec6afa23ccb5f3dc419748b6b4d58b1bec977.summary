-- before two pirate leaders departed the captured yacht where they held four @entity4 earlier this month , a maritime source says they left instructions : kill the hostages if we do not come back from negotiations			1
@entity4 officials later took the two negotiating pirates into custody -- a move that goes against standard negotiation practices , the maritime source said			1
the four @entity4 were later killed , but it is not clear why			1
also not clear is when during the negotiations -- or why -- the @entity4 detained the two pirate negotiators			1
the pirates ' detention goes against standard negotiating practices , as the pirates came in good faith to make a deal to hand over the hostages , said the maritime source , who was briefed on the incident and has connections to @entity30 intelligence officials			2
the source asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation			0
@entity34 declined to comment on whether officials detained the pirates and said the @entity37 and the @entity38 have the lead in the case			1
the @entity38 had no comment sunday			0
on friday , the @entity37 said there was no comment due to the continuing investigation			2
however , a @entity4 government official told @entity0 the talks with the two pirate negotiators faltered when it was determined the men " had no authority to negotiate anything			2
" @entity4 officials then took the men into custody rather then let them return to the yacht , the @entity4 official said			2
" it would be unfathomable to have put them back on the boat where they might have done harm to the hostages , " the official said , disagreeing with a published report that the detention of two fellow pirates might have upset those still aboard the captured yacht -- named the quest -- who were holding four @entity4			2
" there was no change in mood , no escalation " and gunfire broke out on the quest more than eight hours later , the @entity4 official said			0
the official took issue with a @entity75 report that said the @entity37 's hostage negotiator aboard the @entity77 decided the two @entity78 were not serious about resolving the matter , which led @entity4 officials to take the two men into custody and ask for a new representative from the pirates			1
according to the the @entity4 official , who was not authorized to discuss the @entity67 hijacking on the record , the issue was not whether the two pirates were serious about negotiating , but that they lacked the power to cut a deal			2
the @entity4 side continued trying to negotiate via radio with those still aboard the yacht and made an offer , and were told by the suspects aboard the quest they would sleep on the matter before providing a reply , the @entity4 official said			0
the @entity99 also tried to contact @entity78 on land who might be able to exert influence over the men holding the @entity67			0
the @entity37 hostage negotiator is part of a special team based at @entity107 , @entity108 , and had field experience , the @entity4 official said			1
it was unclear if that experience included any previous negotiations with @entity78 pirates			0
@entity4 @entity114 and @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 were found shot to death after @entity4 forces boarded the quest around 1 a.m. tuesday , @entity4 officials have said			1
the 58 - foot yacht was being shadowed at the time by the military after pirates took it over off the coast of @entity126 on february 18			0
@entity4 forces had responded after a rocket - propelled grenade was fired at a @entity99 ship about 600 yards away -- and missed -- and the sound of gunfire could be heard on @entity67 , @entity99 vice admiral @entity131 has said			1
the killings took place as negotiations involving the @entity37 were under way for the hostages ' release			1
when @entity131 spoke last week , he said two pirates boarded a @entity99 ship monday for talks			1
he told reporters he had no information on details of the negotiations or whether a ransom had been offered			0
two pirates were found dead on board the @entity67 , said @entity131			0
in the process of clearing the vessel , @entity4 forces killed two others , he said			1
thirteen other pirates were captured and detained on the @entity67 , along with the other two already aboard the @entity99 ship			1
@entity131 said authorities believe the pirates were trying to get the vessel and hostages to @entity78 , or at least into @entity78 territorial waters			0
piracy has flourished recently off the coast of @entity78 , which has not had an effective government for two decades			0
globally , more than 50 pirate attacks have already taken place in 2011			0
as of february 15 -- the most recent statistic posted on the @entity165 's website , pirates were holding 33 vessels and 712 hostages			0
@entity0 's @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report			0
