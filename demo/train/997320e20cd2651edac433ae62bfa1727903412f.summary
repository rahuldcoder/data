-- last week , 19 - year - old @entity2 university student @entity1 was reported missing after she stopped responding to @entity3 and texts from her roommate			2
as it turns out , @entity1 was fine -- she 'd just turned off her phone for a while -- but the expectation of constant , instant communication was so normal in her social circles that taking a break was a shock to her friends			2
there 's a growing movement that wants to make taking such a break from our electronics the rule , not the rare exception			2
friday marks the start of the fifth annual @entity23 , an initiative launched by the national nonprofit group @entity25 to help people take a break from their always - on lifestyles			1
participants are encouraged to put away their phones , tablets , laptops and other @entity34 - connected doodads from sunset friday to sundown saturday for a digital sabbath			1
the time might instead be used for quiet reflection , communing with nature , reconnecting with family or friends , focusing on a project and even getting a rare , uninterrupted night 's sleep			1
" i think that people are overwhelmed			1
it 's physically taken a toll on people , " said @entity25 's communications manager , @entity47			1
" if you think you have to respond to everything all the time , that 's an unrealistic expectation			1
" participants are encouraged to sign a pledge on the event 's website and post a photo of themselves saying why they unplug			2
some recent examples : " ... to focus on the faces in front of me			2
" " ... to be open to the divine			2
" " ... to connect			2
" the concept has caught on since the first unplugging day in 2010			2
organizers have signed up more than 200 local and national groups as partners , including the @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			0
many will be hosting their own official events such as in - person gatherings and phone - free parties			0
without the safety net of a smartphone , event - goers will probably work on dying social skills like maintaining eye contact , making small talk and communicating verbally in more than 140 characters			0
although the official holiday lasts for just 24 hours , the idea is to create more awareness of how we interact with our devices and the impact this has on our work , family and mental health			1
then people can take smaller steps to carve out device - free pockets of time during the day and eventually find a balance that works for them			1
" day to day , throughout your day , you should be thinking about unplugging moments , " @entity47 said			0
concern about our dependence on our electronic devices has grown in recent years as it 's become increasingly difficult to step away from the online world			1
phones beep and blink and beg for our attention with e-mail , text notifications , breaking news or updates from social media			0
even when a phone is quiet , many of us still reflexively pick it up to check news and messages during moments of downtime			0
researchers are still studying the impact that smartphones and mobile technology have on our lives			1
in the work sphere , there 's increasing evidence that multitasking is inefficient			0
the brain ca n't fully focus on a task when it 's constantly jumping around to do bite - size tasks like checking e-mail			0
at home , the divided attention can have a negative impact on relationships with children and partners			1
@entity47 recently heard stories about overly connected families firsthand when she spoke to a class of eighth - graders about unplugging			0
the students shared tales of their parents working at all hours or not listening because they were glued to their smartphones			1
it takes willpower to step away from technology			0
@entity47 has some tips for people interested in cutting down			1
replace the phone on your bedside table with an alarm clock			0
that way , you 're not checking the device right before bed and first thing in the morning			0
the stimulation and even the light from the smartphone screen can disrupt sleep			0
set goals and schedule times when you think it would be beneficial to go sans phone			0
make sure some of those times are when you 're alone , not doing anything at all			0
people instinctively pick up their smartphones when there 's a lull in a conversation or when they 're waiting in line			1
look around , observe people , be alone with yourself and think about what you might be missing in those moments			1
psychologists have been researching something called attention - restoration theory			0
the idea is that people can better focus on tasks after taking a break to experience nature and giving part of their brains a rest			1
something as simple as taking a walk or looking at photos of nature can reset people 's attention spans and reduce stress			1
before you drop off the grid , be sure to give people a heads up			1
as the @entity1 incident illustrates , going cold turkey can be jarring when your friends or bosses expect instant responses to their messages			0
set boundaries -- like letting your workplace know you wo n't be checking e-mail after a certain hour -- and stick to them			0
the more people who participate , the less unusual it will seem , according to @entity47			2
" what we we need to do is reset society 's expectations , " she said .			0
