-- a @entity2 supermarket chain has defended the sale of a wearable @entity5 flag that has been compared to a @entity7 uniform			1
the white and red flag of @entity9 in stock at @entity12 outlets features a pointed hood which the store says will allow @entity5 fans to show support their national team during the @entity17 while keeping dry during the notoriously unpredictable @entity2 summertime			1
but some fans have taken to social media sites to register their disapproval of the similarities between the Â £ 3 ( $ 5 ) flags and the hooded outfits worn by the @entity7			1
twitter user @ beyondlimits posted " dear @entity12 , your wearable klu klux klan style @entity5 flag is not acceptable			2
" meanwhile , @ @entity30 said " i do n't think @entity12 thought the whole ' wearable flag ' thing through properly			2
" pictures of the offending item have since been tweeted and retweeted hundreds of times on the micro-blogging site			0
a subsidiary of the @entity40 retail giant @entity41 , @entity37 issued a statement to @entity0 friday addressing their surprise at the controversy and stressing that their hooded flag product is also available in other country 's national colors			1
" we know there 's chatter on twitter about our wearable @entity17 flags , but it 's simply a flag with a hood -- nothing more , nothing less , " the statement read			2
" we opted for a hood on our wearable @entity5 and @entity59 flags as you never know what the @entity2 weather will bring			0
" we want customers to get behind the team without getting wet			0
" the flag is just one of numerous @entity17 themed items @entity12 has been stocking in the run up to the tournament which kicks - off in @entity59 on june 12			1
other @entity2 supermarkets such as @entity71 and @entity72 's offer similar @entity17 items which extend into products like beers , food , barbecues and televisions			1
last year the @entity79 estimated that the @entity2 economy could lose Â £ 2 billion ( $ 3.5 billion ) if @entity5 failed to qualify for the @entity17			1
businesses are hence keen to cash in on the event while it lasts			0
however , it was n't just @entity85 users suggesting @entity12 might have struck the wrong note with the wearable @entity5 flag			2
" in theory it was a good idea because it 's @entity5 and it rains , " @entity88 , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at @entity90 , told @entity0			0
" however , i think it does show a lack of good judgment and discretion on the part of people working for @entity12			0
" " this is particularly the case in this country as there 's a debate right now about the @entity103 , about the flag , about immigration and the rise of @entity107 , " referring to the success of the @entity110 - skeptic political party in recent local and @entity112 elections			0
" i think this showed a lack of good judgment on the part of the management , " he said .			0
