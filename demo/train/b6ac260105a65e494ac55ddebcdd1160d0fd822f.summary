@entity0 -- president @entity3 will not be allowing new drilling in the eastern @entity5 for at least seven years , interior secretary @entity2 announced wednesday			1
the exploration of drilling possibilities in sensitive areas of the @entity9 will proceed " with utmost caution , " he said			1
@entity3 's decision effectively reverses @entity13 plans announced at the end of march to open the @entity15 -- along with other large swaths of @entity18 coastal waters -- to oil and natural gas drilling			2
under the plan , roughly two - thirds of available oil and gas resources in the eastern @entity5 would have been opened to drilling			2
areas located within 125 miles of the @entity29 coast would have remained off limits			0
@entity2 said the seven - year ban is being imposed as a result of lessons learned from the april 20 explosion of @entity37 's @entity36 drilling rig in the @entity5 , which killed 11 people and triggered one of the worst environmental disasters in @entity18 history			1
an estimated 4.9 million barrels ( 206 million gallons ) of oil gushed into the @entity5 before the broken well , 5,000 feet below the surface , was capped			0
there is a broader recognition of the need for a more " robust safety regime " and additional environmental analysis in the @entity5 , @entity2 told reporters			1
he dismissed concerns that the decision will seriously damage efforts to further develop domestic energy resources , noting that roughly 29 million acres already under leases in the @entity5 have not yet been developed			0
rep. @entity55 , one of the most vocal @entity37 critics in @entity57 , said the announcement shows the @entity13 " has heeded the lessons of the @entity37 disaster			2
" " this plan will move @entity18 forward on a prudent path until we can ensure that when an oil company drills ultra-deep , it is ultra-safe , " the @entity62 @entity61 said			0
" opening up wide swaths of our coasts to oil drilling before we put the proper regulatory measures in place would have been a mistake			0
" sen. @entity74 , @entity29 , said it is " good the president is listening to the people of @entity29			0
" the administration lifted a six - month moratorium on deep - water oil drilling in october			0
@entity2 has argued that the moratorium provided time to make sure accidents similar to the @entity37 disaster wo n't occur again , and that rig operators are prepared to deal with worst - case scenarios if they happen			1
critics of the ban , including @entity91 leaders , @entity5 state officials and @entity94 residents , said it only hurt oil and gas workers in hard - hit coastal communities , where hundreds of jobs were lost because of the disaster			2
@entity102 gov. @entity101 , a @entity91 and a frequent critic of the @entity3 administration 's handling of the @entity5 spill , said in a statement , " this announcement from the @entity3 administration today will undoubtedly send more economic capital and even more jobs overseas , in the wake of those oil rigs that already left our waters for @entity116 , the @entity117 and @entity118 during the ' arbitrary and capricious ' moratorium on deepwater drilling			1
" environmental groups and other supporters of the moratorium argued that it was necessary due to a lack of effective regulation of deep - water drilling that allowed the @entity36 explosion and subsequent spill to occur			1
@entity1 's @entity130 contributed to this report .			0
