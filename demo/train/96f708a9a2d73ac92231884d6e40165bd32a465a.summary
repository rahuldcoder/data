@entity0 -- @entity3 's government rejected a @entity6 offer to re-establish trade relations that would have allowed the @entity9 state to provide aid to @entity11 , two senior @entity3 government officials said thursday			1
one official , who did not want to be named citing the sensitivity of the matter , said there had been " tentative discussions " within the @entity3 government on the informal @entity6 proposal , which would have linked the re-establishment of economic ties with @entity3 with @entity3 's granting permission for the @entity9 state to send reconstruction supplies and other goods into @entity11			1
the official said that the idea was rejected because it was seen " as a way of bolstering @entity31 " and said @entity27 and @entity28 officials had expressed similar concerns			2
the same official said the proposal did not come as a " formal request or offer " from the @entity6 government but could offer no details on who initially presented the idea			0
news of @entity3 's rejection of the @entity6 offer was first reported by @entity3 newspaper @entity41 on tuesday			1
an official from the @entity27 @entity43 in @entity0 could not immediately comment			0
@entity6 officials could not immediately be reached for comment			0
another senior @entity3 government official said " we were favorable " to the idea of renewed relations , but that the @entity6 " precondition " of allowing " large amounts " of goods into the @entity11 was a deal breaker			1
the official said it was not clear who would have overseen the process			0
the proposal did not address @entity3 's concerns " about the unrestricted flow of material that can be used for defensive fortifications " by @entity31 and " we had to say no , " the official said			2
the @entity65 territory of @entity11 has been subjected to an @entity3 and @entity28 blockade since 2007 , when the @entity68 group @entity31 staged a violent coup ousting the @entity71 government lead by @entity72 , a rival political faction			1
@entity6 and @entity3 maintained trade relations from 1996 until last year			1
relations fell apart after the start of @entity3 's military operation against @entity31 in @entity11 at the end of 2008			1
the three - week campaign , dubbed @entity79 , ended with approximately 1,400 palestinians and 13 @entity3 killed			0
in protest , the @entity6 government in @entity81 ordered the @entity3 trade office closed			1
@entity6 was the only @entity9 country to maintain official relations with the jewish state			0
in a statement released earlier this month after a meeting of @entity90 leaders , the @entity6 prime minister @entity86 criticized @entity3 's @entity11 policy , saying it contravened international legitimacy			1
" we have to concentrate on confronting the @entity3 siege imposed on @entity11 which is oppressive and it is our duty to save the @entity65 who are part of us and we are part of them , " he said			2
@entity6 has long sought to bolster its role in regional diplomacy			0
bringing about a deal to send in construction supplies to @entity11 would be regarded by many in the @entity90 world as a diplomatic coup , though it is unlikely that @entity28 would be receptive to such an arrangement			0
the @entity3 daily newspaper @entity41 reported thursday that @entity28 had expressed its opposition to @entity3 over the @entity6 proposal , and that it was ultimately rejected so as not to upset the government of @entity28 president @entity111			2
@entity28 @entity113 spokesman @entity112 told @entity1 that " the @entity3 newspaper report is a fairy tale and quite illogical			0
" " since when do the @entity3 need to consult with @entity28 when they want to establish relations with any other party ? " @entity112 asked			0
" it is clear that the @entity3 do not want to offend the @entity6 and therefore they ( the @entity3 ) resorted to their usual game in striking a nerve in order to start trouble between @entity28 and @entity6 , just to make @entity3 look innocent , " the spokesman added .			2

@entity3 officials say @entity6 offered to re-establish trade relations
@entity6 wanted to provide economic aid to @entity11
@entity3 fears any aid would bolster @entity31 , officials say
