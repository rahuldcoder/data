@entity0 -- while saying there are no indications yet of dangerously high radiation levels in the atmosphere , a @entity3 government official said sunday that there is a " possibility of a meltdown " at two of the country 's nuclear reactors			1
chief cabinet secretary @entity14 told reporters that officials still do not know if there have been meltdowns in the no. 1 and no. 3 reactors at the @entity22 's nuclear facility in northeast @entity3			1
but as they attempt to cool down radioactive material and release pressure inside the reactors , he said authorities were working under the presumption that such meltdowns have taken place			1
" we do believe that there is a possibility that meltdown has occurred			1
it is inside the reactor			0
however , we are assuming that a meltdown has occurred , " he said of the no. 1 reactor			2
" and with reactor no. 3 , we are also assuming that the possibility of a meltdown as we carry out measures			1
" a meltdown is a catastrophic failure of the reactor core , with a potential for widespread radiation release			1
@entity14 's comments confirmed an earlier report from an official with @entity3 's @entity51 , who had told @entity1 , " we see the possibility of a meltdown			1
" though @entity54 , director of the agency 's international affairs office , said engineers have been unable to get close enough to the core to know what 's going on , he based his conclusion on the fact that they measured radioactive isotopes in the air saturday night			0
" what we have seen is only the slight indication from a monitoring post of cesium and iodine , " he said			0
but @entity54 added that he did n't believe a disaster was looming			2
" we actually have very good confidence that we will resolve this , " he said			0
@entity14 , too , raised few alarms during his press conference sunday			1
he based his optimism in large part on measurements of radiation outside the nuclear plant , conceding fluctuations may occur while stating that levels have generally decreased			1
" we are continuing to monitor the radiation , but it is ( under ) control , " he said			2
@entity14 said that nine people have tested positive for high radiation levels on their skin and clothing , with doctors now trying to determine if they were impacted internally			1
medical care , including radiation screening , will be offered to those who are being evacuated from the nuclear zone , the secretary added			1
the @entity3 government was preparing to distribute iodine tablets to residents , the @entity94 said			0
@entity98 is commonly recommended to block the uptake by the thyroid gland of radioactive iodine			0
the problems at the @entity22 plant began friday , when the 8.9 - magnitude quake struck off the eastern shore of @entity106			0
the quake forced the automatic shutdown of the plant 's nuclear reactors and knocked out the main cooling system , according to the country 's nuclear agency			1
a tsunami resulting from the quake then washed over the site , knocking out backup generators that pumped water into the reactor containment unit to keep the nuclear fuel cool			1
@entity14 said that there have not been any leaks of radioactive material at either of the affected plants			2
authorities deliberately have let out radioactive steam in order to alleviate growing pressure inside both of the affected reactors			2
pressure had been mounting inside the reactors as steam built up inside , because water meant to cool the fuel rods was boiling			1
as of sunday morning , winds in northeast @entity3 were blowing out to sea at 5 - 15 mph , said @entity134			0
but they were expected to reverse direction by monday night , he said			0
the @entity22 plant is located about 160 miles ( 260 kilometers ) north of @entity0			0
plant officials are also injecting sea water and boron into the plant in an effort to cool its nuclear fuel and stop any reactions			1
@entity145 , a chemical element , was being added to the water " to sort of stymie other potential nuclear reactions , " according to @entity148 , senior scholar at the @entity149 and a former senior policy adviser to the @entity152 secretary of energy			1
he described the plan to use salt water as " an act of desparation " by @entity3 authorities , who seemed unable to deliver fresh water or plain water to cool the reactor and stabilize it			1
earlier , @entity14 had pointed out another potential challenge -- saying , without elaboration , that " some of the readings in the measurement equipment were not accurate			2
" the detection of a cesium isotope -- as noted by @entity169 -- indicates that the reactors ' nuclear fuel cladding has failed , said @entity172 , a physicist and former scientist at @entity174			2
" now we have to hope that the containment building will succeed in preventing major amounts of radioactivity " from escaping , he said			0
@entity22 facility has such a building -- something that @entity182 , the @entity184 nuclear plant that famously melted down in 1986 , did not have			2
@entity185 can remain dangerous for 600 years and is associated with a number of cancers , said dr. @entity188 , a member of the board of @entity190			0
some experts said the flow of information from the agency has not been fast enough			0
but @entity94 director general @entity195 defended the @entity3 response			0
" i know the @entity3 authorities are working their hardest to gather the necessary details and ensure safety under difficult and constantly evolving circumstances , " he said in a statement			0
if the effort to cool the nuclear fuel inside the reactor fails completely -- a scenario experts who have spoken to @entity1 say is unlikely -- the resulting release of radiation could cause enormous damage to the plant or release radiation into the atmosphere or water			1
that could lead to widespread cancer and other health problems , experts say			0
authorities have downplayerd such a scenario , insisting the situation appears under control and that radiation levels in the air are dangerous			1
still , as what they described as " a precuation , " more than 200,000 people who live within 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) of the plant have been ordered to leave the area			2
a similar evacuation order has been issued for those with 10 kilometers of the @entity232 nuclear facility , a separate plant also in @entity232 prefecture			2
even absent this , nuclear materials expert @entity235 -- president of the @entity152 - based @entity237 , a firm involved in security and peace funding -- ranks this scenario third , behind @entity182 and the 1979 partial meltdown of a reactor core at the @entity245 nuclear plant in @entity246 , among history 's worst nuclear power crises			1
@entity3 is heavily dependent on nuclear power , with 54 plants and another eight slated for construction , said @entity252 of @entity253 , an environmental group			0
all are located in " very seismic " areas , she said			0
while experts acknowledged that @entity3 's nuclear program is very well respected , physicist @entity172 saying that now " we 're in uncharted territory			0
" " the bottom line is that we just do n't know what 's going to happen in the next couple of days and , frankly , neither do the people who run the system , " added dr. @entity188 , a member of the board of @entity190			2
what we do know , he added , is that @entity3 's nuclear facilities are " way out of whack			0
" @entity1 's @entity269 and @entity270 contributed to this story .			0
