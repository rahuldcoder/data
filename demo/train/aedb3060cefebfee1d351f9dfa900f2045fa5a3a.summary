@entity0 -- @entity3 regulators are directing 31 nuclear reactors similar in design to the @entity7 plant in @entity8 , where an earthquake and tsunami caused a meltdown two years ago , to take additional steps to help contain radiation and other damage from any accident that is not quickly halted			1
the @entity16 directive on thursday requires enhancements to systems for venting accumulated pressure from containment structures during an emergency			1
vents must also be able to safely handle rising temperatures , hydrogen concentrations and radiation levels			0
the changes also aim to ensure that plant personnel can continue to operate vents safely if a reactor core melts down , the agency said			2
plants in the @entity3 were ordered last year by the @entity16 to take other steps to upgrade their " hardened " venting systems after the 2011 disaster in @entity8 that crippled three reactors and released radiation into the atmosphere			1
it was the worst nuclear accident since @entity39 in 1986			2
" strengthened vents will help these plants continue to protect the public and the environment even if emergency systems ca n't immediately stop an accident , " @entity16 chairman @entity40 said in a statement			1
" by safely releasing built - up pressure and hydrogen , the plants will preserve the buildings that contain radioactive material , " she said			2
@entity3 plants covered under the directive are older , boiling - water reactors mainly similar in design to the @entity7 facility			1
during the meltdown in @entity8 , containment pressure exceeded twice the design limit , and there was no power or air to vent systems , according to an overview of the disaster by the @entity67			1
the goal for completing venting improvements in the @entity3 is 2014 , depending on refueling schedules			0
additional steps would take longer , if deemed necessary			0
the directive covers scenarios for structures meant to condense steam generated during an accident and control pressure and for the larger structures that surround the reactor			0
the @entity16 also plans to develop a rule to improve the filtering of radioactive material from any vented gases and to improve procedures for preserving the integrity of containment systems			2
an industry group said the new order is in line with its assessment of the " most effective means " to address venting			0
" venting to protect containment integrity and to mitigate the impact of a serious event is among the long - established training responses that are part of these facilities ' severe accident mitigation guidelines , " according to a statement from the @entity101 , a trade group for the industry			0
the organization said the timetable is achievable but it did not provide a cost estimate			0
plant operators may have to spend nearly $ 3.6 billion over the next three to five years on modifications to the nation 's 102 nuclear facilities in response to the @entity7 accident , according to a @entity113 survey released on thursday			1
this includes costs for government mandates to handle threats from flooding and earthquakes as well as related engineering studies , @entity113 , an energy industry information service , said .			0
