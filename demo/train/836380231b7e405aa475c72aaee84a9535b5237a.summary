@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 closed a sex - related criminal probe of former @entity7 rep. @entity6 on friday without filing charges , authorities said			1
" there is insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges , " said @entity9 , commissioner of the @entity4			0
authorities were investigating whether the @entity1 @entity14 , who resigned in september 2006 , might have used congressional computers to engage or solicit minors in any illegal activities			1
officials said they were hindered by refusal from @entity6 and the @entity21 to allow inspection of the computers			1
" @entity4 conducted as thorough and comprehensive investigation as possible considering @entity25 and mr. @entity6 denied us access to critical data , " @entity9 said in a written statement			1
" should additional information arise which is pertinent to this case , we will ensure it is appropriately investigated			0
" @entity6 is " relieved " that no probable cause was found to charge him with a crime , his lawyer , @entity31 , told reporters friday evening			1
but in a statement @entity31 read on behalf of the former congressman , @entity6 added , " i however recognize that while my behavior was not illegal , it does not by any means make it proper or approriate			2
to the contrary , i am deeply ashamed of my conduct , which was wrong and without question inappropriate			0
" @entity6 said he takes full responsibility for his actions and apologized , particularly to the recipients of the e-mails or instant messages			1
" i continue to pray for forgiveness from those i have disappointed " and emotionally harmed , @entity6 said in the statement			2
@entity6 entered treatment for alcoholism on october 1 , 2006 , he said in his statement , and has been clean and sober since the day he resigned from @entity25			1
@entity31 has denied that his client engaged in sexual activity with minors			1
" he is absolutely , positively not a pedophile , " attorney @entity31 said previously			0
" he is apologetic for the communications he made while under the influence of alcohol , which he acknowledges are totally inappropriate			0
" those communications included scores of e-mails and instant messages that were given to investigators by former @entity21 pages			1
the exchanges -- in which @entity6 used the screen name @entity70 -- were published in a @entity72 report in december 2006			2
@entity31 told reporters friday that @entity6 has no intention of re-entering politics and is focusing on his recovery			2
the @entity4 put the price tag for the nearly two - year investigation at about $ 37,800			0
@entity6 entered a treatment facility for alcoholism shortly after resigning , saying he is gay and was molested by a priest when he was between the ages of 13 and 15			2
a catholic priest living in @entity84 admitted in a tv interview that he molested @entity86 when he was a teenager			0
" once maybe , i touched him or so , but i did n't -- it was n't -- because it 's not something you call , i mean rape or penetration or anything like that , you know			0
we were just fondling , " said the priest , @entity95			0
the ethics committee 's probe concluded that @entity21 @entity14 leaders were negligent in not protecting male teenage pages from possible improper advances by @entity6			1
but the panel said there were no violations of the @entity105 and decided no one would be reprimanded			0
a @entity108 report issued a month later said the @entity109 should have notified the @entity21 or other officials when members first learned of the inappropriate e-mails			2
the @entity109 acted within its " range of discretion " when it initially decided not to open a criminal investigation in the case , the @entity108 said			0
but the internal watchdog 's investigation concluded that simply filing away the complaint from a public interest group was an inadequate response			0
the @entity4 's investigative summary notes that the @entity7 @entity21 's clerk of courts took possession of two computer hard drives from @entity6 's two district offices in @entity1 and the computer from his @entity130 office , along with backup material			1
the department said it did not seek a search warrant for the drives because it failed to turn up probable cause of a crime with a @entity1 connection			0
the department report said that @entity6 's attorneys voluntarily worked with the @entity108 to review computer data , but the @entity4 failed to work out a similar review with @entity6 's attorneys			1
the department said it was given no indication from the @entity109 or the @entity108 that there was any non-congressional data in the material that would violate @entity1 law			1
@entity2 's @entity149 and @entity150 contributed to this report .			0
