until now " sequestration " has been a word that only means something to people living inside the @entity3 or to political junkies who depend on their daily dose of @entity7 and @entity8			0
but if @entity11 and the president do not reach a deal by march 1 , which appears likely , @entity10 will quickly learn what it means -- namely deep spending cuts			1
the spending cuts pose a significant political threat to @entity18 , more so than to @entity19			1
although many @entity18 are standing firm , insisting that their party will be fine if the cuts go through , there are many reasons for the @entity18 , through a sober eye , to see the dangers that lay ahead			2
the cuts could push congressional politics in a liberal direction and establish the foundation for solid @entity19 gains in 2014			0
last week @entity32 argued that president @entity33 was responsible for the sequester idea , not the @entity18			2
but while people are squabbling over who owns the sequester , the @entity18 will take the hit regardless			0
the danger for @entity18 is that the budget cuts will severely weaken public support for the austerity theme that the party has been promoting since 2010			1
the cuts will make " deficit reduction " something very real to average @entity10 citizens and business and something that is often quite painful rather than an abstract debate over numbers			1
opinion : one cuts , @entity53 throws a tantrum while @entity10 have historically been hostile to government , they tend to support specific government services when asked by pollsters			1
so @entity53 's overall spending might not be popular as a concept , but @entity62 and @entity63 are			1
the spending cuts will shift the debate toward the specifics			0
@entity10 will watch as government services are retrenched			2
the last time this happened , things did n't go well for the @entity18			2
when the federal government shut down in 1995 - 1996 because of a budget standoff between @entity18 and president @entity72 , the @entity18 faced a huge backlash when @entity10 were unable to access basic government services , such as obtaining a passport or visiting the national zoo			1
opinion : the spending cut fairy tale president @entity33 has already been using the bully pulpit to make this case , appearing with first responders and warning of how the cuts will impact police , hospitals , teachers , airline workers and more			0
standing in front of a group of police officers , @entity33 said , " federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go			0
" while these speeches are a form of political theater , they are based on very real possibilities			0
the budget cuts that result from sequestration would just be the first of the threats the @entity18 faces			1
if the government has to shut down as a result of a standoff when the government 's general operating budget expires in late march or the debt ceiling is not raised this spring , @entity18 will continue to lose the public 's confidence in their ability to govern and the reduction in services will highlight to @entity10 what the government actually does			1
if the economy sputters as a result of the spending cuts , as some economists predict , deficit reduction will look even worse			1
an already frustrated workforce will become even more angry , and likely take out their frustration on a @entity18 that has been insisting deficit reduction should be the nation 's short - term goal , rather than stimulating the economy			1
conservatives will suffer as the focus of congressional debate will quickly shift from the issue of spending cuts , where the emphasis has been since 2011 , to the issue of spending more			0
once the cuts go through , frustration and anger with the impact on government services will certainly produce increased pressure on legislators in both parties to offer a fix , namely to restore spending to key areas			2
@entity144 : @entity33 ca n't kick his legacy down the road with legislators already thinking about the 2014 elections , this will be tempting			0
if this shift occurs , republicans , who have invested so much in making fiscal discipline their top issue , will be operating in a congressional environment where the debates center around areas where the government needs to devote more government resources rather than less			0
the automatic spending cuts are the ultimate symbol of a dysfunctional government			2
the reason the cuts were put into place was that president @entity33 and @entity11 were unable to reach an agreement on taxes and spending			0
government leaders agreed to put a gun to their own head by threatening unpalatable cuts if they were unable to reach a deal			2
now the trigger is about to be pulled			0
the problem for @entity18 is that the polls show that the approval rating of the @entity18 is in the tank while president @entity33 is doing relatively well			0
according to @entity181 , only 19 % of @entity10 approve of how republicans are handling their job			0
@entity33 is enjoying his highest favorability ratings since 2009 , with 60 % having a favorable rating of him in a @entity187 poll			0
the likelihood , as in 1995 - 1996 , is that the public will blame the dysfunction on the @entity18 rather than @entity19 and the party will suffer a further erosion of its standing as a result			1
according to a recent poll by the @entity196 and @entity197 , @entity18 would be blamed for the cuts by almost half of @entity10 , while only 31 % would blame @entity33			1
news : @entity201 @entity18 doubts damage from defense cuts sequestration will soon become a dirty word in the @entity10 political lexicon			1
while it is impossible to predict which way the political winds will blow , there is good reason for @entity18 to see how they can suffer politically if some kind of deal is not reached			2
republicans , who have now struggled through two presidential elections and are facing a demographic shift that does not work in their favor , might want to start thinking harder about their strategy on spending			0
deficit reduction is no longer a winning issue for the @entity18 .			1

@entity223 : @entity53 's budget fight will grab public 's attention if no deal reached
he says painful cuts will lead the public to blame @entity18 for @entity53 's dysfunction
@entity10 do n't like government spending in general but like specific *programs* , he says
@entity223 : @entity18 needs to *rethink* its reliance on deficit reduction as a prime strategy
