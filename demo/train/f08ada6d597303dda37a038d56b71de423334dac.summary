-- @entity1 is seeking to buy back @entity3 's home ground in order to switch to a new location that he hopes will help the @entity8 club remain competitive on an international scale			1
@entity10 , which dates back to 1876 , once hosted a crowd of almost 83,000 people			2
but many decades since that 1935 landmark , its capacity is now only 41,841 -- having been converted into an all - seater venue in the safety - conscious 1990s			0
however , ownership of the stadium was given to a fans ' collective long before billionaire @entity1 bought the west @entity22 club in 2003 , in order to fight off the prospect it would again be bought by property developers			1
the terms of the deal which eventually sold @entity10 to @entity29 ( @entity29 ) in 1999 , a move that required a Â £ 10 million ( $ 15 million ) loan from the club , meant the team can not keep its name if it relocates			1
can football chants ever go too far ? " we know only too well how close the club came to losing our home prior to the formation of @entity29 , but that threat has now gone under mr. @entity1 's ownership , " @entity3 chairman @entity36 told the club 's website			1
" and with the @entity29 structure in place , we can not plan with certainty for the future			2
i hope all shareholders vote in favor of the proposal			0
" the @entity29 members will make their decision at a special meeting on october 27 that will have a massive bearing on @entity3 's future plans			1
with the introduction of @entity64 's financial fairplay rules looming , @entity3 's need to maximize revenue and become less dependent on the club 's @entity60 benefactor is growing			1
@entity8 rivals @entity65 can entertain more than 75,000 fans at every home game , while @entity69 's @entity68 holds some 60,000			1
bigger grounds are seen as the way ahead , with @entity72 recently losing out to @entity73 in a bitterly - contested bid to take over @entity22 's new @entity75 after 2012			2
however , @entity77 clubs have some way to go before catching their @entity80 rivals			0
@entity82 's @entity81 has the continent 's largest capacity at almost 100,000 while @entity87 rivals @entity85 top 85,000 at the @entity88			2
@entity90 's @entity89 is the biggest football ground in @entity92 with a capacity of 80,000 for domestic matches , while @entity96 's @entity95 regularly brings in almost 70,000			2
in @entity99 , the two @entity98 clubs can draw crowds of 80,000 -- though @entity101 bucked the trend by moving to a smaller 41,000 - capacity ground this season , leaving behind the unpopular 60,000 - plus @entity105			0
success in @entity64 's biggest club competition , the @entity107 , still eludes @entity1 despite the vast fortune he has pumped into @entity3			1
a move to a new venue -- which would be within a three - mile radius of the club 's current home if completed by 2020 , under terms of the offer to the @entity29 -- would be a big statement of his desire to make @entity3 a worldwide force			1
" i am sure all @entity3 fans have enjoyed the football and success we have witnessed at @entity10 since 2003 , and @entity3 and mr. @entity1 are determined to ensure that the club continues to compete at the highest level of world football , " chief executive @entity119 said			1
" we continue to look at options for expanding @entity127 , and i should be clear that we have not identified a site for a new stadium elsewhere			0
" @entity3 's offer to the @entity29 's 12,000 stakeholders is at the original price of Â £ 100 per share -- an investment of Â £ 1.5 million			1
" bear in mind that no - one bought these shares as a financial investment , " @entity36 told the @entity135 @entity134			0
" everyone bought these shares as a way of helping the club and they also bought them as mementos and souvenirs			2
" we have n't considered making them a big offer because we believe that they are fans of @entity3 and want to do what 's best for @entity3			1
" on offer is a promise that 10 % of the planned minimum 55,000 seats will be available to families and fans aged under 21			0
@entity29 shareholders who vote for the sale will be listed on a roll of honor at any new stadium , and would get priority for buying season tickets			0
the @entity162 , however , is not convinced that the club should leave its longtime home			0
" where is the proof that @entity10 ca n't be expanded ? undoubtedly many fans would prefer to stay , and i suspect loss of hotels / restaurants would not be a major concern for many , " @entity167 wrote in a statement on its website			2
" the ' walk of honor ' proposal is risible and insulting			0
given that any new ground would be bigger , the ' priority season ticket ' offer is surely nebulous as well , as well as morally reprehensible			0
" he also questioned why the vote had been called at such short notice , without any future venues being identified , and why the offer did not take into account inflation since the original 1993 @entity29 deal			0
needing a 50 % majority approval from the @entity29 shareholders , @entity1 may yet find more obstacles in his dreams of world domination .			0
