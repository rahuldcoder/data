-- a sequel to @entity3 's classic 1946 film " @entity4 " is in the works , but it might take a @entity7 miracle to turn this reboot into a classic			1
according to a news release from film financier @entity13 and his company @entity14 , " it 's a @entity11 : @entity18 " will tell what happened to the @entity16 of @entity4 after the first movie ended			1
to help bridge the two films , producers announced that @entity21 , who at 6 - years - old played @entity23 alongside @entity24 and @entity25 , will reprise her role			1
@entity21 might have been charming as little @entity23 in the original , but her film resume ended roughly when her teens started in 1952			1
there are also talks with other living original cast members to see if they would sign on to the movie , which may sound like a holiday treat to some and like a lump of coal to many			2
" it 's a @entity11 : @entity18 " will be written by @entity39 , known primarily as a music producer , and @entity41 , whose resume largely consists of her work done on @entity45 specials in the 1980s and ' 90s			0
@entity13 has financed a long list of films -- including " @entity49 , " " @entity50 " and " @entity51 " -- but most of them were hits in the last century , and his credits as a producer appear to be minimal			0
despite a reported $ 25 million to $ 32 million budget and an projected release next holiday season , the movie resembles an independent film rather than a high - profile sequel			2
and that 's if it can even get off the ground ; the copyright to the original is its own complicated story			0
@entity68 controls the rights to " @entity4			0
" at one point , it was believed to have been part of the public domain and these new filmmakers seem to be operating as if it is			0
requests for comment from @entity68 have not been returned , but it 's worth noting the network has been protective enough of the classic 's legacy that it airs the film sparingly even during the holidays			1
for his part , @entity13 says this new movie would continue the classic story for " an entirely new generation of moviegoers " and he is proud " to be involved in moving this story forward			0

a sequel to the classic " it 's a @entity11 " is being planned
the plot follows the @entity23 family after the original movie ended
@entity21 , who played 6 - year - old @entity23 in the 1946 film , has been cast in the sequel
