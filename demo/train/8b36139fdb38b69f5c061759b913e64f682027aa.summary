@entity0 -- @entity2 and @entity3 have just celebrated the 50th anniversary of the @entity5 in @entity6			1
even @entity8 prime minister @entity7 had to respect this most symbolic date and wait another 24 hours before delivering his long - awaited speech on @entity11			2
in 2003 , for the @entity5 's 40th anniversary , @entity12 had lavishly received chancellor @entity14 , and the whole of the @entity16 to @entity17			1
in his speech , the @entity2 president had invoked @entity20 , @entity21 and of course @entity22 and @entity24 , the founders of the @entity2 - @entity3 rapprochement in 1963			1
this year , @entity6 was hosting the celebrations with a @entity16 bursting at the seams , having had to add 577 extra seats to accommodate the whole of the @entity31			2
@entity3 chancellor @entity32 and @entity2 president @entity33 gave a common press conference , met with students , answered their questions and went for lunch			1
some in the press corps , like @entity39 , @entity41 's @entity40 correspondent , complained about the food and tweeted a picture of the menu : beetroot , red cabbage and red berries , prompting the all too predictable comment : " why did n't they let the @entity2 do the cooking ? " opinion : why @entity33 must show clearer leadership there was pomp , emotion and comedy			2
as @entity33 made its way into a packed @entity60 for his speech , he missed a step			0
a broken leg would have sent the wrong message			0
luckily , the president did n't fall			0
a few moments later , when the first notes of the @entity68 started filling the @entity60 for the first time in the building 's dramatic history , even @entity2 mps held their breath and eyes got misty			2
for the @entity5 has no comparison in contemporary history : it still , to this day , offers a unique model of reconciliation between two states			0
@entity2 and @entity3 enjoy joint cabinet meetings and political partnerships at all levels			1
both countries have gone from hereditary hatred , to hereditary friendship			0
and this is no small accomplishment in light of the three wars @entity2 and @entity3 waged against each other from 1870 to 1945			1
as @entity91 from think - tank @entity92 ( @entity90 ) put it : " the @entity5 is to @entity2 and @entity3 what the @entity95 is to the church , even if people do n't read it every day			1
" with a combined total of 40 % of the eurozone gdp , 33 % of the entire @entity102 's population and 31 % of its budget , @entity2 and @entity3 are the locomotive of the @entity102 and remain so even when their respective heads of state are at odds			1
it always takes a @entity2 president and a @entity3 chancellor a couple of years to get along well			1
@entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , even when they both belonged to the same political family , took time to work together			0
but when there is a spark and personal chemistry between the two leaders , this means progress for the whole continent			0
during intermediary phases when they are getting to know each other -- like today , with a social democrat @entity33 and a conservative @entity32 -- progress is slow			0
nowhere better than in @entity40 is this more obvious			0
and it is especially damaging in time of a crisis such as the one we 're living			0
this is why @entity2 and @entity3 have no choice but to find a compromise or there could be consequences for the @entity11 project			1
@entity2 thinks financial solidarity should precede political integration , @entity3 suggest the opposite			2
no doubt the markets and their 25 @entity11 partners in the union will soon remind them to come up with a common view			0
at this time more than ever -- in the week that @entity7 has promised @entity8 a referendum on its @entity102 membership -- @entity11 's future depends on @entity2 - @entity3 unity of purpose and action			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .			0
