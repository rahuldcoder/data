-- just like those petite waifs that glide effortlessly down the @entity4 , seen at first - hand the beauty of @entity2 can be breathtaking			1
the @entity5 is one of the world 's most iconic buildings and is just one of the city 's many highlights			2
yet like those same @entity2 ladies who wear their hauteur like a badge of honor , the city is not without its dark side			2
in recent years the @entity19 capital has had its elegant facade ruffled by an explosion of discontent among the city 's disenfranchised underclass			0
young men -- many the offspring of @entity28 immigrants -- angry at the lack of opportunities and perceived racism from state institutions have taken to the streets , fighting violent pitched battles with police			2
all this has happened in the city 's ghettoized suburbs -- the banlieues			0
if you stay in the pristine center , you 'd never know it was going on			0
the ugly high - rises of the unkempt banlieue are a world away from the tourists ' @entity2 : a timeless masterpiece of tree - lined boulevards , majestic architecture and white - aproned waiters uncorking bottles of @entity53			1
the city 's abundant charms give it a unique ability to bring out the romantic side of even the most world weary			0
winding your way along the banks of the @entity62 near @entity63 on a spring day can feel like being in beautiful day dream			0
of course , you might find the illusion comes crashing down around you when you sit down at a cafe and discover the rudest man on the planet disguised as your waiter			0
but what would @entity2 be without those famously haughty @entity72 , regarding you with thinly veiled contempt when you try to order " deux billet pour le metro " in a bad @entity19 accent ? for all its classical beauty the city center is actually a fairly modern creation			1
the cramped and disease - ridden streets of medieval @entity2 were torn down in the 19th century			1
the work commissioned by @entity82 and supervised by the urban planner @entity83 transformed the center into the city of wide boulevards and grand squares that you see today			1
@entity83 's @entity2 might look like the set from a sumptuous period drama but it 's not untouched by the modern			1
competing for space alongside the @entity5 on the @entity2 skyline , is the post-modern strangeness of the @entity95 and the sleek glass arch at @entity97			1
these modern creations do n't get the approval of all @entity72 or of the tourists , and you sometimes get the impression contemporary @entity2 is slightly stifled by its past -- a victim of its own beauty			2
of course there 's only one way to contemplate this and the many other questions the city raises			0
that 's with a cafe au lait in hand , seated at a terrasse watching the world , and the waifs go by .			0

@entity2 remains one of the most charming and beautiful cities in the world
the center was *rebuilt* in the 19th century by @entity83
away from central @entity2 , the suburbs have suffered *rioting* by angry youths
@entity2 is represented in avante - garde creations like the @entity95
