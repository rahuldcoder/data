-- in the tense standoff between a @entity4 nurse and state officials , it was a surreal scene			1
nurse @entity6 , who recently returned to the @entity7 after treating @entity9 patients in @entity10 , went on a bike ride with her boyfriend thursday -- followed by a police cruiser and a throng of journalists watching their every move			1
her lawyer called the ride " a good way to exercise her right			2
" @entity6 told reporters she " just wanted to enjoy this beautiful day			1
" hours later , gov. @entity23 said negotiations with @entity6 over where she could go had failed , adding that he would " exercise the full extent of his authority allowable by law " to keep her away from public places			1
" i do n't want her within three feet of anybody , " @entity23 told @entity0 affiliate @entity32			2
" right now , she can come out of the house if she wants , but we ca n't protect her when she does that			2
the reason there 's a police car there when she does that is to protect her more than anybody			2
' cause the last thing i want is for her to get hurt , " he said			2
" but at the same token , her behavior is really riling a lot of people up , and i can only do what i can do			2
and we 're trying to protect her , but she 's not acting as smart as she probably should			2
" the state has made it clear it 's going to do something			0
but what ? " the first thing the governor has to do , which he has not yet done , is get a court order which requires her to stay in quarantine , " @entity0 senior legal analyst @entity58 said			1
" there is no court order now			0
she 's not violating anything by taking a bike ride or leaving her house			0
" there 's no guarantee the governor will be able to get a court order , @entity58 said , " because , according to the science , she is not in a communicable situation			1
" it 's unclear what the exact sticking point has been in negotiations between the state and the nurse			1
at first , @entity4 officials said they wanted @entity6 to remain at home for 21 days -- the deadly virus ' incubation period			1
since then , they 've said they want @entity6 -- who has twice tested negative for @entity9 and says she feels healthy -- to avoid public places such as stores during that time			1
she 's about halfway there ; the incubation period , in her case , is set to end the second week in november			0
" i 'm just asking her to be reasonable , " @entity23 told @entity32			0
" let 's get to november 10 , and then you can do whatever you would like			0
" attorney : nurse was making a point with bike ride @entity6 has said it 's state officials who are n't being reasonable			1
she contends the @entity100 and science are on her side			1
" i 'm fighting for something much more than myself , " she said wednesday after emerging from the home where she had been staying			1
" there are so many aid workers coming back			0
it scares me to think how they 're going to be treated and how they 're going to feel			0
" @entity6 has said she 's willing to compromise with the state , and that she 's open to travel restrictions barring her from public transportation and limiting her to @entity113 , a town of 4,000 on the @entity115 border			1
" so i think there are things that , i know , work , " she said			0
" and i know all aid workers are willing to do those things			0
but i 'm not willing to stand here and let my civil rights be violated when it 's not science - based			2
" one of her attorneys , @entity125 , told @entity0 that the couple went for the bike ride to make a point : she could be out in public " without freaking everyone out			0
" " you can take a bike ride , be in the public and not actually interact with people , " @entity125 said			0
" we thought this was a good way to exercise her right			0
we did n't want anyone in the town to be scared , even though the fear is based in misinformation			0
" what could be next ? when she returned from a month working with @entity144 in @entity10 last week , @entity6 had a temperature at an airport in @entity147 , @entity148 , officials said			1
she was put into an isolation tent .			0

negotiations in @entity4 over nurse have failed , governor says
@entity6 and her boyfriend leave a @entity113 home on bikes , return about an hour later
@entity6 says science and @entity100 on her side
