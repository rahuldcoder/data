-- when @entity2 gives you advice , it pays to listen			1
@entity5 did so last year , and he won his first major tournament			1
now , having missed three cuts in a row ahead of his @entity16 title defense next week , the world @entity7 has again acted on the wisdom of one of golf 's greatest champions			1
@entity5 had intended to pay his first visit to the host course , @entity21 's @entity20 , just days before the season 's second major tees off			1
but after a joint interview with @entity2 , hosted by @entity26 of @entity0 's @entity28 show , the 23 - year - old decided to go there early and use the free window that opened up when he missed the weekend action at the @entity32 run by the " @entity2			1
" @entity5 had planned to go straight from @entity33 to @entity34 for this week 's @entity35 in the hope that more competitive play would help restore the form that has made him the world 's most exciting young player			1
but it was @entity2 , winner of a record 18 major titles and joined by @entity44 on sunday in second place on the @entity47 roll of honor with 73 victories , pointed him in the right direction			2
" my wife has always had a statement , which is : ' there is no excuse for not being prepared , ' " the 72 - year - old said			0
" i know that there were times when i was n't prepared and i got exactly what i deserved -- nothing			0
" @entity44 revealed after his victory on sunday that he had visited @entity20 before the @entity32 , and that it had been perfect preparation			1
" not to disparage the @entity34 tournament , but nobody remembers who won last year in @entity34			0
they do remember who won last year 's @entity16			2
we will never forget that , " @entity2 said			2
after self - destructing in the final round at last year 's masters , @entity5 turned to @entity2 for advice			1
" i said it is really important to know what happened and that you understand what happened to you and that you will try not to make the same mistakes , " @entity2 said			2
" i said that i had given away a @entity16 where @entity78 ( @entity77 ) won , i gave away a @entity79 by not knowing how to win and i gave away another @entity16 not knowing how to win -- but i learned from it			2
" then he went right on to win a @entity16 and absolutely blitz the field			2
i dropped him a note saying that you obviously learned something in @entity85 , but more important did you learn something from your win ? " the two are a combination and are very important to his career			0
he has a great , great future in front of him			0
" @entity5 won by eight shots at @entity94 , setting the lowest score in @entity16 history as he smashed the previous best total set by @entity2 , @entity44 , @entity98 and @entity99			1
" i know @entity2 always went to the tournament 's venue a week before and spent four or five days there to prepare , " @entity5 acknowledged			1
" i think the reason that he won many more majors than anyone else was because he prepared more than anyone else			0
" you know when he stood on the first tee on thursday he felt like he was better prepared than anyone else -- that in itself gives you confidence			0
" @entity114 will tell if @entity5 's last - minute change of plans will solve his problems , but @entity2 is confident that the @entity118 will soon be back on track			1
" @entity5 right now is worrying how he is going to put that back together , but we all go through it , " he said			0
" i had the same problems			0
i went from 1967 to 1970 right in the prime of my career without winning a major			0
and you know i just found that i was probably lazy , i had too much success , i had n't worked hard enough to prepare myself			0
" i just worked myself out of it , then in 1970 i had success at the @entity79 and i was back again			0

@entity2 tells @entity5 to spend more time at @entity16 venue
world *no.* 2 *struggling* to find form ahead of his title defense next week
@entity118 visited @entity20 after missing cut at @entity32
@entity2 says @entity5 needs to learn from both his successes and *failures*
