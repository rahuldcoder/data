-- family members of the deposed @entity4 president @entity3 @entity2 are reportedly in @entity5 , a development now being denounced by some in the @entity4 community there			1
@entity10 - language media in @entity5 first reported that as many as 10 members of the @entity2 family arrived in @entity13 by private jet on thursday			1
@entity5 immigration minister @entity15 seemed to confirm their arrival by pointing out that some members of the @entity2 family have permanent residency status in @entity5 and therefore have the legal right to enter and stay without a visa			1
privacy legislation does not allow the government to disclose who is in the country			0
but @entity5 officials also stressed to @entity0 that @entity5 would not become a refuge for @entity2 or his family			1
" mr. @entity2 , deposed members of the former @entity4 regime and their immediate families are not welcome in @entity5			1
visas are only issued by our officers when they are satisfied that the individual will leave @entity5 once the visa expires			0
given that members of the regime can not return to @entity4 , that would be a challenge			0
" said @entity38 , a spokesperson for @entity39			0
permanent residency in @entity5 can be revoked if it is determined that a person falsely represented themselves , committed fraud or concealed material circumstances when they applied for citizenship or permanent residency			2
still , the fact that members of @entity2 's family , possibly including his daughter and son - in - law , may have the legal right to stay in @entity5 did not sit well with some members of the @entity4 expatriate community			1
a @entity4 business leader in @entity13 who declined to be identified told @entity0 he believed it was time the @entity5 government took a tougher stand with @entity2 's extended family			1
" even permanent residents should n't be protected if they are criminals			0
and @entity5 needs to investigate their affairs here			0
what about freezing their assets ? " there are reports in @entity5 that the former president 's daughter , @entity69 , and her husband , @entity70 , still own a @entity13 mansion that they acquired in 2008 for more than $ 2 million			2
@entity0 could not confirm that the couple still own the property			0
in an e-mail , @entity5 's @entity74 confirmed to @entity0 that there are a range of options that allow for assets to be frozen , including through the @entity80 , or at the request of a foreign government			2
" if there is evidence that assets exist in this country , or if they were acquired illegally , our government will act			0
" said @entity89 , press secretary to @entity5 foreign affairs minister @entity90			0
on monday , @entity10 president @entity91 stressed that his country would track down any assets in @entity10 that were stolen during @entity2 's time in power and return them to @entity4			1
a prosecutor in @entity98 also confirmed that the country was opening an investigation into @entity2 's @entity10 assets .			2
