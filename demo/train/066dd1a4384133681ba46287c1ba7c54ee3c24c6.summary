-- why do @entity1 always land in the @entity2 , wondered someone in " @entity4 " ? good question			2
@entity6 plays a bureaucrat forced into action in " @entity9 , " a film about extraterrestrials			1
but it 's not always the case , as @entity15 's adventurous sci - fi movie , " @entity9 , " goes to show			1
presented in the now - familiar fake - doc style -- at least until @entity15 gets bored with its limitations when the action heats up -- " @entity9 " is an edgy little b movie with an injection of impressive big - money special effects courtesy of " @entity19 " director - producer @entity20			1
the story 's origins are with the extraterrestrials ' arrival in the early ' 80s , when they park their spaceship a mile or so above @entity29 , @entity30			1
the ship is vast -- almost the size of the city -- but when after three months there has been no contact from the visitors , no sign of life in any form , the authorities decide to break in			2
what they find is a wretched cargo of pale , starving creatures : tall bipeds with scaly skin and stubby insect - like tentacles around the mouth			0
the humans call them " prawns , " and after establishing that the worst threat they pose is a cosmic @entity55 disaster , they bring them down to earth and stick them in a refugee camp			2
that would be @entity9 , a shantytown of makeshift wooden shacks , no electricity or running water , and scarcely enough space for the million or so newcomers			1
after a couple of decades of uneasy coexistence , even this set - up seems too cozy for the residents of @entity29			1
with civil strife and black - market gangsters getting out hand , it is decided the prawns should be relocated to a new camp , somewhere out of harm 's way			1
international law being what it is , the @entity30 are required to collect the signatures to indicate the prawns ' acquiescence			0
and that 's where mild - mannered bureaucrat @entity84 ( @entity6 ) comes in -- with a delegation of trigger - happy private security guards			2
" @entity9 " is a truly global affair			1
the @entity30 - born @entity15 learned his trade in @entity90 , and found a mentor in @entity92			0
but it 's the location that allows this allegory to resonate			2
here in @entity96 we may darkly imagine that interlopers not only mean us harm but that they have the wherewithal to back it up			0
in @entity30 , though , the story takes on more complex , queasy echoes			0
the @entity102 effectively invented concentration camps here at the turn of the 19th century , and the @entity106 , the victims then , would mandate that native @entity107 were nothing but second - class citizens			0
naturally the prawns come lower still down the pecking order			0
@entity15 indulges in grisly , blackly comic satire worthy of @entity114 " @entity113 as our man @entity115 ( @entity115 ) casually demonstrates the art of aborting alien offspring with the aid of a flamethrower , all for the edification of the viewers back home			0
complacent and overconfident in front of the cameras , @entity115 gets his comeuppance when he accidentally ingests an unidentified liquid substance , which incurs an alarming physical reaction			0
at this point , the movie changes tone , sometimes for better , sometimes not			0
" @entity9 " also begs plenty of questions ; not much of it makes sense if you stop to think about it			1
and @entity15 seriously overplays his hand in the long , thoroughly conventional climactic shoot - ' em - up			0
what should have been a taut 90 - minute nightmare flick -- a classic midnight movie -- has somehow pumped up into a 112 - minute approximation of a @entity145 action blockbuster			2
still , " @entity9 " has plenty of material to chew on			1
expanded from a six - minute short , it 's a brashly confident debut , full of sharp , inventive detail ( the prawns are crazy for cat food ) and rooted in a couple of @entity153			1
well worth the time , if not all of it			0
" @entity9 " runs 112 minutes and is rated @entity156 's review , click here .			1

" @entity9 " is a *winning* debut , says @entity0 's @entity160
film is about extraterrestrials who *emerge* over @entity29
eventually , they *'re* to be moved to a camp , and then the action starts
