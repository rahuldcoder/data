-- back in 2007 , when i was participating at a conference on @entity2 - @entity6 relations , the late @entity2 diplomat @entity1 repeatedly came back to the importance of not writing the @entity2 off , while warning against getting overexcited about the new emerging @entity6 imperium			1
" the @entity2 , " he said , " is not going away any time soon			1
" @entity1 's views are evidently shared by the current leadership of @entity6			1
while many commentators excitedly jabber about the end of the @entity2 era and comment on how president @entity17 -- diminished by his recent electoral drubbing at home -- is regarded as weak and irrelevant in @entity20 , the people that matter , namely the @entity6 leadership , have proved shrewd enough not to buy into this sort of talk			1
they see through the transient nature of presidents and their power , and as a strategic political and economic partner , understand that former secretary of state @entity27 was right : for them , the @entity2 is the one indispensable nation			2
the proof of this is the comprehensive agreements issued this year during the @entity33 meeting in @entity20			0
forget all the theater of @entity36 president @entity35 scowling at @entity17 minutes before trying to engulf the @entity6 president 's glamorous wife in a shawl , or the icy image of @entity6 president @entity41 shaking @entity44 prime minister @entity43 's hand			2
because the reality is that -- despite the narrative we might like to impose on all this of a world beating its tracks to @entity20 's door -- for policymakers in @entity20 , deals like the one just made with the @entity2 on slashing carbon emissions , or the ones on security and economic cooperation , are the one currency truly worth having			2
but the most misleading aspect of @entity2 - @entity6 relations is that while in public they are frequently conducted in snarling rhetoric , underneath both sides probably have more mutual links and increasing common ground than ever before			1
and while separating the sound and fury from the truth is tough , on the fight against terrorism , the need to find sustainable economic growth , preserving a benign , stable international environment , and increasing predictability in the global financial governance system , @entity6 and the @entity2 often pretend they are much further apart than they actually are			1
their main business now is tactical -- trying to search out spaces for strategic advantage			0
with its proposed @entity84 , along with building diverse energy supply links through @entity36 and central @entity86 , @entity6 is engaged in staking out discrete spaces where it can move without being hedged in			2
it knows that long arguments with neighbors like @entity44 peg it down and reduce its space to act			0
having as many friends as possible is @entity41 's diplomatic priority , after years of brittle tensions with so many countries around @entity6 's land and maritime borders			2
there is a simple reason for this			0
@entity6 is entering a period of tough economic transition			1
the @entity107 and @entity108 meetings of the @entity109 made this clear			0
many things need to be done , from raising consumption to addressing water supply issues and the dangerous state of the air quality in the country			0
too many rows with the world outside distract from the real business of dealing with these internal matters			0
and in all these areas , whatever the distrust and misunderstandings held by the world 's second biggest economy toward the largest , the gains from continuing to be constructive and mostly friendly , at least on the surface , far outweigh the benefits of acting tough			0
of course , all this might change one day , when @entity6 really feels it has to demand more international strategic space and sees the @entity2 as an impediment to that			1
but @entity33 this year has underscored that that day is a long time in the future .			0

talk of the end of a @entity2 era *premature* , says @entity138
