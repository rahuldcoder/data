@entity0 , @entity1 -- a team of experts gathered friday on @entity1 's @entity5 to decide how to deal with marauding bears that reportedly have killed two people recently			1
as many as 12,000 bears live on @entity1 's @entity5			1
the bears are blamed for the deaths of two guards at a geological station near a platinum mine on the peninsula in far eastern @entity1			1
@entity1 media reports cite local law enforcement officials as saying the remains of the two men had been " gnawed on			2
" groups of bears have been reported in the region since the deaths , and many people have refused to work at the mine , saying they are afraid			1
three hunters and a representative of @entity28 , employer of around 400 people at the mine , will evaluate the danger and decide whether killing a few animals is necessary , said @entity34 of the @entity35 in @entity5			1
" all decisions are made locally , " he told @entity2			0
" no licenses [ for shooting bears ] have been issued yet			2
reports came out that they were , but that 's incorrect			0
" hunters might need to kill only the most aggressive bears , he said			2
generally , bears are timid animals and need only to be scared off			0
exterminating wild bears that are not afraid of humans is relatively common in @entity48 and the @entity49			2
trouble in northeastern @entity5 began when the two unarmed geological station guards were found dead july 17			1
more than 93 miles ( 150 kilometers ) away , about 20 bears came into another station several days later			0
then , dozens more wild bears were seen 25 to 50 miles ( 40 to 80 kilometers ) away , around various stations and villages in the area			0
" @entity58 came out to where they used to live before , " @entity34 said			0
" it constantly happens on the @entity5 , on various rivers , places where people work			1
" humans are to blame because they attract the animals by leaving out trash or they frighten bear cubs , turning them into aggressive grown - ups , he said			0
@entity69 , senior adviser for the @entity70 in @entity1 , also said it 's the search for food that probably drives bears close to human camps			1
@entity5 bears are used to feeding on salmon in the summer , but there have been fewer of the fish in local rivers this year because of overfishing , contamination or natural causes			1
" when [ bears ] do n't have salmon , they go into some of the settlements , creating bad situations both for themselves and people , " @entity69 said			1
" when you 're in bear country , it 's important to know how to act when you meet a bear			0
" the @entity5 has long been known for its brown bear population , estimated at 8,000 to 12,000			2
in some areas of the peninsula , the population density is the greatest in the world			0
human deaths from bears are rare , and @entity69 said it would be an overstatement to say the situation this year is out of hand			0
@entity2 's @entity104 contributed to this report .			0

two guards killed july 17 near platinum mine , apparently by bears
groups of bears seen in other parts of @entity5 in eastern @entity1
@entity115 says it may be necessary to shoot some bears to *protect* people
experts say salmon *shortage* is driving bears into closer contact with humans
