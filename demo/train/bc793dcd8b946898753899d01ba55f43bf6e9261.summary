after sunday 's commuter rail derailment next to the @entity1 in @entity2 killed four passengers and injured scores more , observers are once again ready to assail the backwards state of the nation 's rail infrastructure			1
how could @entity9 let something like this happen in the 21st century in one of the nation 's greatest global cities ? the train was going a shocking 82 mph when it should have been traveling at 70 mph , slowing to 30 mph into the curve at @entity18 station in the @entity19			2
the engineer of the train said he was " in a daze " at the time of the accident			0
do n't we have technologies that can prevent trains from gathering and maintaining such speed at dangerous curves -- or technologies that can automatically deploy the brakes if they do ? if these technologies exist , and we know they do , are we simply not investing properly in our trains and tracks and signaling systems ? surely there will be an outcry about the sad state of @entity2 's @entity40 funding , and the funding of the nation 's rails and infrastructure networks as a whole			1
much of the developed world has invested heavily in high - speed rail and yet the @entity9 , with a massive market for long - distance intercity rail travel , has not even scratched its surface			1
our governors have balked at support for high - speed links , channeling federal subsidies instead to more politically popular state projects like roads , highways and bridges -- leaving high - speed intercity travel a dream and our regional rail systems an uneven patchwork of service			1
but the lessons of the @entity18 derailment wo n't be known for some time , and they likely are n't so simple as more investment			1
for a start , the technology that could have potentially prevented the fatal derailment -- positive train control , or @entity70 , is already being deployed on freight lines across the country			1
mandated by the @entity75 , tens of thousands of track side devices are being connected to rail signals and switches to communicate wirelessly with retrofitted locomotives up and down the country 's major rail thoroughfares			0
engineers operating trains with @entity70 systems will be told and shown in real time exactly where and how much they need to slow down , based on the curvature of the track , on congestion and on the train 's speed , weight and length			0
failure to respond to the computer data will result in automatic deployment of the train 's brakes			0
@entity98 says train crash victim was ' pure goodness " its nice to think that entirely new systems incorporating new and faster cars would make derailments disappear into the history books , but they probably wo n't			1
although the absence of high - speed technologies in this country means that rail travel is not an attractive option for certain long - distance journeys and contributes to higher levels of pollution and road congestion in places , it does n't really make rail travel any less safe			1
indeed , countries with high - speed rail have roughly the same rate of derailments and crashes as we do -- often with far more serious consequences			1
within five years of announcing its extraordinary $ 250 billion investment in 7,500 miles of high - speed rail , the country opened its first high - speed line			1
the same year , 2008 , a horrific train crash on the @entity133 to @entity135 bullet train line claimed 70 lives			0
three years later , in 2011 , a signal failure along one of the new high - speed rail routes out of the capital claimed another 40 lives and injured 192 -- leading to public outrage and questions about the integrity of the nation 's entire high - speed rail program			1
@entity148 's investments in its intercity networks are typically older and more established than those of @entity125 -- but they are not immune to rail tragedy either			2
despite extensive and popular programs of high - speed rail , both @entity152 and @entity153 have had their share of train accidents			1
video footage of a 2013 derailment in northwest @entity152 , just outside @entity160 , displays an eerie resemblance to sunday 's @entity163 accident			2
a passenger train rounded a bend at roughly twice the speed it should have , coming off the rails adjacent to a station and killing 78 people			0
the problem was apparently not mechanical -- it was human error			2
does any of this mean we should be complacent when an incident as tragic as sunday 's happens ? of course not			0
we should leave no stone unturned in identifying the cause of the crash			0
if it is ultimately attributed to an equipment failure , we should and will likely see a renewed call for greater capital investment on the part of the @entity40 -- and perhaps even legislative action to support it			0
but we should n't be na√Øve enough to think that more investment in our rail network in the form of newer or faster equipment necessarily makes the network safer			2
that investment must be smarter for it to really save lives			0
although unions across the transportation world typically balk at its introduction , increased automation is often the answer to transportation safety problems			0
the train control systems being deployed are likely to reduce the risks of accidents like that witnessed on sunday dramatically -- much the same way automation in planes and cars has reduced pilot errors in the sky and made road driving safer			0
but even the most sophisticated vehicle control systems in the world will not protect us completely from human error -- for that we have only ourselves to blame .			2

@entity216 : after *deadly* train derailment in @entity2 , people lament state of @entity9 rail system
@entity216 : technology that might have prevented accident is being deployed on freight lines
@entity216 : horrific rail crashes in @entity125 , @entity152 , @entity153 show high - tech is n't safer
more investment wo n't make trains completely safe , she says . it wo n't stop human error
