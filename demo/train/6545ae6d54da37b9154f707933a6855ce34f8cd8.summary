-- " @entity1 " has all the story arcs for romantic - comedy gold , including a newly brokenhearted protagonist trying to find her way in life and love , an unlikely meet - cute of opposite personalities and an advisory panel of cheeky best friends			1
but one of the film 's major through lines is a topic not often broached in theaters : abortion			1
the film , which premiered at the @entity20 and will open nationwide on friday , has been called " the most winning abortion - themed rom - com ever " by the dissolve , and in a piece called " no more @entity23 " on @entity24 , writer @entity21 deemed it " the most honest abortion movie i 've ever seen			1
" though the movie successfully mines the traditional rom - com tropes for laughs , groans and " awwwws , " abortion is emerging as its unlikely claim to fame			1
" we do n't feel like that description does it justice , " producer @entity35 told @entity0			2
" it 's as much about a stand - up comedian and her life in @entity42			1
( an abortion ) happens , but it does n't have to define her			2
" when @entity35 spoke with @entity0 , she acknowledged the filmmakers were " trying to humanize the experience , " even including a scene during the main character 's abortion procedure			2
but they " never set out to make an agenda - driven film , " @entity35 said			1
@entity54 wrote and directed " @entity1 " ; actress @entity56 stars as @entity57 , the bathroom - humor - prone comedian who chooses to undergo an in - clinic procedure after a booze - fueled , one - night stand with @entity63 - bred prepster @entity61 , played by @entity64			1
abortion has long been a hot topic in pop culture , from " @entity70 " in 1972 to @entity69 's " girls " in recent years			2
the release of " @entity1 " comes shortly after a woman faced criticism for filming and releasing footage of her own abortion in order to show that it was n't the traumatic experience for her that many assume it to be			1
in 2010 , the @entity81 reported 765,651 legal induced abortions , with women in their 20s -- like @entity86 's character -- contributing to the majority of that number			0
the debate in movies , tv and viral clips is a reflection of real life : according to a recent @entity0 / @entity97 survey of @entity98 , 27 % of respondents said abortion should be legal in all circumstances , 13 % said it should be legal in most circumstances , 38 % said it should be legal in a few circumstances , and 20 % said it should always be illegal			1
@entity35 says as a born - and - raised @entity42 , both she and director @entity54 came from a world where conversations about abortion happened " in a shame - free , regret - free , clear way " with mothers , friends and sisters -- and that was the experience that they wanted to show on - screen			2
in " @entity1 , " several characters along the way reveal they had abortions ( some legal , some not ) in their teens and 20s			2
as with any romantic comedy , the two leads , @entity61 and @entity57 , maintain a " will they / wo n't they " vibe throughout most of the film -- and that 's intentional , @entity35 says			1
but @entity57 's decision to terminate her pregnancy is n't wishy - washy , or even driving the plot			1
it 's the result of a drunken one - night stand that ends without exchanging phone numbers			1
she 's lost her job , and is trying to get a comedy career on track -- from @entity57 's perspective , the choice is clear			2
" it 's very decisive , " @entity35 says			0
in a scene filmed in an actual @entity144 , @entity57 says , " i 'd like an abortion , please , " then apologizes about sounding like a fast - food customer before repeating her request			1
@entity35 says it was crucial to illustrate the actual abortion process : a camera focuses on @entity57 's face as the sedative kicks in and vacuuming sounds hum in the background			1
" i think we 've seen a lot of movies where they fade off into the sunset before that action happens , " she says			0
" it was critical to show this moment where it 's safe and healthy and also vulnerable			0
" " this is an experience that many women go through without shame and regret , but not without emotion			0
hopefully it 's something that people can connect to and have a conversation about			0
whatever side you 're on			0
" framing the ever - contentious issue in a romantic comedy has captivated audiences			0
" it should n't be a particularly earth - shaking turn , but in a world of rom - coms like ' knocked up ' and ' juno , ' in which the heroines make the heartwarming decision to go ahead with their pregnancies , this modest little indie movie feels momentous , " @entity175 film critic @entity174 said of the film			1
meanwhile , a piece at the @entity189 asked , " has @entity186 hit a new low ? " its gist : " the film seems to be another @entity186 attempt to reinforce their idea of female empowerment			0
in this case , it includes one night stands and abortions			0
" @entity54 told nonprofit news organization @entity199 : " whatever other conversation occurs , we 're really excited			0
... ( conservatives bashing " @entity1 " ) have n't seen the movie ; they 're basing it on articles and trailers			2
" still , just as with any summer romantic comedy , the filmmakers hope the takeaway for viewers is sweet , sincere and relatable			0
" hopefully , the movie is one that makes people feel confident in who they are and the choices that they make , " @entity35 says			0
" and sometimes with confidence comes vulnerability -- and that 's a very human experience			0
" do you think abortion is a fitting topic to include in a romantic comedy ? share your thoughts in the comments , on @entity225 or on @entity227 's facebook page			0
