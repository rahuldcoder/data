a third successive year of @entity1 's worst drought in a century has the @entity3 's reservoirs at record lows			0
agriculture has been affected , hitting the local economy , while some small communities risk running out of water			1
but business is booming in @entity1 's @entity10 ( @entity11 ) , through a pioneering wastewater treatment facility that recycles used water -- or sewage -- and returns it to the drinking supply			1
the plant is expanding production from 70 to 100 million gallons per day , enough for 850,000 people , around one - third of the county population			1
as the @entity22 output is mixed with the main groundwater supply it reaches over 70 % of residents			0
global problem the facility is among the oldest and largest of its type in the world , and could represent a model solution for a global problem			1
the @entity32 warns that half the world population will face water scarcity by 2030 , accelerated by climate change and population growth			1
shortages on such a scale would threaten food production , as well as a health crisis through increased exposure to unsanitary water , which already kills millions each year through waterborne diseases such as cholera and diarrhea			1
but the introduction of reuse systems has been difficult , with a high degree of public skepticism			2
@entity10 began recycling water for non-potable use in the 1970s , but only began contributing to the drinking supply in 2008 , combined with a comprehensive pr and education campaign to allay public fears			1
operators now feel the system is well established and ready to scale up			0
" it 's a watershed moment right now , we 're seeing widespread acceptance of these technologies , " @entity11 general manager @entity58 said			0
" as the shortages become more extreme and water supplies are cut , it has raised awareness that we need to find alternative resources			2
" the process works by re-routing a proportion of the 1.3 billion gallons of waste water generated in @entity1 each day into a three - step treatment			1
the first is microfiltration of the treated waste water to remove solids , oils and bacteria , before the resulting liquid goes through reverse osmosis , pushing it through a fine plastic membrane that filters out viruses and pharmaceuticals			2
the water is then treated with uv light to remove any remaining organic compounds , before joining the main groundwater supply , which must pass strict quality controls to meet legal standards , and distribution to households			1
read this : machine makes drinking water from thin air the @entity11 says the water exceeds all state and federal drinking water standards			1
safety has also been established in pioneering projects around the world			2
water - insecure @entity102 , previously reliant on imports , now delivers 30 % of its needs through the newater reclamation facility			1
although only a small amount is added to its reservoirs , the output surpasses @entity109 standards for potable use to the extent that a high proportion is directed for industrial uses requiring ultra-clean water			1
one of the world 's earliest schemes , in @entity117 , @entity118 , has been in operation since 1968 and has tackled both shortage and water - borne diseases			1
over half of the @entity124 population faces water insecurity , and the greatest health risk , diarrhea , kills over a million people each year in the region			1
but research showed that in the 1970s disease occurred at lower rates for people supplied by the @entity117 plant than through conventional treated sources			0
" standards are stricter because of the novelty of the technology and process , " says @entity136 , president of the @entity137			0
" the quality from sewage is very good , as good or better than the tap water in any city in the developed world			1
" the message is now being heeded and the model is spreading			0
@entity1 has put $ 1 billion into funding recycling for potable use ( $ 800 million of that in low - interest loans ) , with new initiatives launched in @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156			2
@entity160 , parts of which are also severely affected by drought , aims to generate 10 % of all new supplies through reclaimed water by 2060			2
a facility in @entity164 has introduced the first " @entity167 " scheme in the @entity166 by sending recycled water to the final treatment plant without passing it through groundwater reserves			1
dealing with disgust in each case , public relations are key , as recycled water schemes have been historically shot down by public disgust at the concept			1
this was most vividly shown in the @entity180 city of @entity181 in 2006 when local activists represented by the group " citizens against drinking sewage " defeated plans to introduce reclaimed sources , citing health risks and emotive factors			1
but @entity180 also shows the extent to which attitudes have changed			0
after a three - year public trial , the city of @entity193 will receive up to 20 % of its drinking water from reclaimed sources in coming decades , with a reported 76 % public support			1
a network of similar programs is being established across the country , according to the @entity201			0
psychologists say the aversion is deeply held and difficult -- but not impossible -- to overcome			0
" the disgust comes from intuitive concepts of contagion , " says dr. @entity204 of the @entity205 , who has studied reactions to reclaimed water			2
" it is magical in nature , the same type of thinking that underlines voodoo practices			0
" " one of the best ways to get past it is perceptual cues -- if you can see sparkling fresh , clear water , and taste it that helps to overcome the concept ... the contagion type thinking decreases with familiarity , " says @entity204 , adding that necessity can also be a key driver			2
" if you 're desperate you 'll override anything for survival			0
" energy and cost in @entity10 and other facilities , mixing the output with groundwater is a largely unnecessary , confidence - building measure to allay public fears			2
but as awareness improves , operators hope to move from indirect to direct potable reuse , which would bring down energy use and costs , while avoiding the counter-intuitive step of re-contaminating purified water			2
" the main cost is energy and that is coming down all the time , " says @entity58			0
" improvements in membrane technology allow us to use less pressure to do the same thing			0
" the energy cost of reverse osmosis has come down by 75 % since the 1970s , he says , while emerging technologies such as @entity256 may reduce it further			0
even now , the cost is favorable compared with desalination or imported water in @entity1			0
@entity58 hopes such advances will allow for the creation of portable modular units that can be cheaply transported to the areas of the world with the greatest need			0
campaign group @entity267 does much of its work in education outreach , through messages such as the " @entity273 " concept , that all water is ultimately recycled			1
" it 's the same water now as when dinosaurs walked the earth , " says executive director @entity275			0
" it 's about understanding the water cycle and how we fit into it			0
once people think about it , they become more open - minded			0
" if costs continue to fall and public acceptance continues to grow , waste water can become a major defense against the projected scarcities of this century			0
the @entity137 projects that recycled sewage will be a normalized source of drinking water in cities around the world within 30 years , and much of the infrastructure and technology is already in place			1
it 's up to us now to get used to it .			0

@entity166 and beyond increasingly looking to reusing sewage water for drinking
half the world population will face water scarcity by 2030
reused water is completely healthy , but psychological *barriers* remain
@entity102 produces large amounts of high - quality recycled water
