@entity0 -- june 29 , 2007 transcript this is a @entity3			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity7 , @entity8 : thanks for checking out our latest summer edition of @entity11 , where today 's show , all about tech. i 'm @entity15			1
a college professor has found a way for his students to listen to his lectures even when they 're not in the classroom			1
and we talk to students and experts to find out some of the ways technology is being used in schools			1
first up : gadget gifts @entity26 : it 's better to give than to receive			1
you 've probably heard it a hundred times			1
but when that gift is for a techie , there 's a gaggle of gadgets to go through			1
so how do you know which present to pick ? @entity37 is here to help with the breakdown on some cool tech toys			1
( @entity40 ) @entity41 , @entity0 reporter : are you searching for that perfect gift , but you are just a little bit stumped ? well , no worries			1
@entity45 from @entity46 is here to help us out , steer us clear and hopefully give us some great ideas			1
and i know you have some great ideas for us			1
@entity45 , @entity51 , @entity46 : look at these beauties			1
first of all , for gaming , you know the @entity55 is hot , but you ca n't find one ? the @entity56 is a pretty good placeholder			1
the dual screen that it 's known for , they 've slimmed it down from its original ds. and of course that great legacy of all those great @entity56 games			1
for $ 130 or less you can get one of these			1
check out this music player , @entity71			1
it 's gon na be the next kind of @entity74			1
it 's called the @entity78			1
that little bump is a @entity81 antenna			1
this can connect wirelessly to the @entity83 or to other devices like it to share music , download music and stream internet radio			1
that is really the future of @entity74 - like devices			1
if you want to give a phone , but you also want to give a music player , this one does both			1
@entity98 's @entity97 is a great music player			1
it 's not an @entity74 , but it 's not bad			2
transport controls and volume buttons out here tell you that it 's something different			2
and then for a camera , i like this very flat @entity107			2
it 's pocket - size , which is very hot these days			2
nice slide - down door			2
8 mega pixels , image stabilization and a great big screen for sharing photos			2
@entity114 : @entity45 of @entity46 , thank you so much			2
( @entity117 ) @entity118 @entity119 , @entity8 : time for the shoutout ! when did the first @entity74 debut ? if you think you know it , shout it out			2
was it : a ) 1997 , @entity127 ) 1999 , c ) 2001 or @entity128 ) 2003 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! if you guessed @entity129 , you 've got the right tune			2
the popular portable players first made the scene in the fall of 2001			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! tech in the classroom @entity26 : whether it 's an @entity74 , @entity107 , @entity141 or @entity142 , it seems like you ca n't go anywhere these days without seeing people plugged in to some type of mp3 player			1
and if you 're on a college campus , you might think students walking around with their ear buds in are listening to music			1
but do n't be fooled			2
they could just be studying up for class			2
( @entity40 ) @entity26 : walk around any college campus and those famous white earplugs seem to be everywhere			1
but sometimes the playlist is n't quite what you 'd expect			2
lectures on @entity158 instead of @entity159			2
not so much @entity160 as history 101			2
some teachers have used the audio @entity74 in their lessons , but at the @entity165 , professor @entity164 hopes to transfer his visual web lectures to the video @entity74			2
@entity168 , user interface design teacher : the students who did web lectures earned grades that were about 10 % better -- we did that three years ago			2
@entity26 : as mp3 players become essential parts of students ' lives , they have the potential to rival the laptop as learning tools in the classroom			1
with a graduate student 's help , @entity164 records lectures before class , so that students can raise questions when they arrive			2
students from @entity164 's user interface design course say they find it valuable to review lectures when convenient			0
@entity192 , student in professor @entity195 user interface design class : it takes 15 minutes to walk from one side of campus to the other side of campus			1
and to be able just to download the mp3 to my @entity74 and just walk across campus , would be very beneficial			1
@entity204 , student in professor @entity195 user interface design class : a lot of people ca n't get to a full desktop computer whenever they need to listen to the lectures , and it 's nice to be able to take them with you			0
@entity26 : although students show enthusiasm towards @entity217 players , there are limitations because they 're small			1
@entity168 : the screen resolution is smaller and navigating between pages will be a little bit slower than on the computer because on the computer i just use the mouse			0
with the @entity74 i have to use the scrollwheel and scroll around			0
@entity26 : like the laptop , the mp3 player is a popular and revolutionary way to gather and disseminate information			0
regardless of what teachers decide to use , players and laptops will remain allies			1
besides , you need a laptop to operate an @entity74 and vice versa			0
( @entity117 ) @entity240 @entity26 : and if downloading lectures is n't enough , we 've got another cool thing you can do with an mp3 player : watch @entity0 student news ! that 's right , you can download our podcast at @entity251 or at @entity252			0
so you wo n't miss out on the news when you 're on the go			0
now and then @entity255 : with cell phones , thin is in			0
but you had to flex some muscle to handle its oversized ancestor			0
an @entity74 can hold your whole music library			0
but a vintage @entity260 let you jam out one cassette at a time			0
microchips keep getting smaller and smaller			0
but old school computers took up a lot more space			0
and game controllers have buttons for every possible move			0
but the retro version ? one button , one joystick , tons of fun			0
learning with technology @entity26 : it 's not just slimmer cell phones and smaller computers			0
advances in technology are changing the world we live in all the time			0
and one of the places where those changes are taking place is schools			0
so we talked to some students and experts to hear what they have to say about teaching with tech. ( @entity40 ) @entity291 , president , @entity293 : we started off , when we were first starting to integrate technology , kind of at that basic level			1
@entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 : we of course use laptops and computers			0
each teacher is assigned a laptop			0
and also , we have computer labs and a media center with computers inside			0
@entity306 , ceo , @entity293 : certainly just dropping technology into a learning environment does n't necessarily improve it unless you are sure that the activities that you are doing align with the expectations that you have for learning			0
@entity314 , junior , @entity315 : i think many careers today require for people to know how to use technology , so it 's important to learn that in school @entity323 : so you ca n't convince me that a student without basic fundamental technology skills is on equal footing for employment			0
@entity328 : i do n't think schooling should be technology dependent , because i think that , at the same time , we should n't rely on something that does n't have a mind of its own			0
@entity323 : you can certainly abuse technology			0
you can abuse the printed word			0
you can abuse access to external resources			0
certainly if teachers and school leaders and parents use the same standards that they would use for any resource for technologies , then we 're in fine shape			0
@entity348 : i can see people in the future having something where you just scan , and all of your , you know , personal information comes up and everything about you can come up on a screen , and i think that 's really cool			0
@entity359 : customization , very innovative , lots of gaming , lots of 3 - dimensional spaces and just social spaces that feed on the needs of young learners			0
( @entity117 ) goodbye @entity26 : and that is the last word in this special edition of @entity11			0
we 'll see you back here soon for our next summer show			0
and of course we thank you for watching everyone			0
