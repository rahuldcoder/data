after three years of avoiding it , president @entity0 finds himself being pushed toward military action in @entity3			1
defense secretary @entity4 and joint chiefs chairman gen. @entity5 both made clear that defeating @entity8 jihadists ' rampage through northern @entity9 would require going after them in neighboring @entity3			2
" that will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a non-existent border , " @entity5 told reporters thursday			0
on friday , deputy national security adviser @entity16 said the administration was looking beyond the current airstrikes within @entity9 's borders			2
" if we see plotting against @entity22 , see a threat to the @entity22 emanating from anywhere , we stand ready to take action against that threat , " @entity16 told reporters			2
the @entity22 is already gathering intelligence on the locations of @entity31 leadership and troops in @entity3 , two @entity22 officials said			1
separately , @entity22 officials said the military has been talking about increasing airstrikes in @entity9 and possibly carrying out tailored airstrikes inside @entity3 against @entity31 targets			1
@entity31 savagery the @entity31 fighters are helping @entity0 make his case with their savagery , which includes mass killings , abductions and other atrocities , such as the video - taped beheading of captured @entity22 journalist @entity46			1
brother : ' more ... could have been done ' to save @entity46 but the president , who has declined to arm rebels fighting the government of @entity3 president @entity51 , faces a policy change certain to embolden critics in both parties of his reticence back then			2
@entity0 had avoided what he called reckless interventions of the past , particularly the @entity58 , launched by his predecessor			2
critics could argue that @entity0 's decision to previously keep out of the @entity3 conflict contributed to @entity31 ' growth			1
his former secretary of state , @entity64 , has distanced herself from him on @entity3 strategy during his first term as she prepares for a possible presidential run in 2016			2
legal barrier evaporated the @entity0 administration has acknowledged sending @entity22 forces into @entity3 earlier this year in a failed attempt to free @entity46			1
that established a precedent of acting in @entity3 to protect @entity22 citizens and interests , superseding any legal considerations such as being asked by the host government to enter , argued @entity78 , @entity0 's former point man on @entity3			1
" there 's a pretty good possibility that we and / or some kind of multinational effort will engage in hitting @entity31 targets inside @entity3 , " he said			1
@entity9 escalation @entity0 already escalated @entity22 military involvement in @entity9 to combat @entity31 less than three years after ending a lengthy war there			1
in june , he sent military advisers to work with @entity9 and @entity91 forces against the lightning isis sweep through the north			0
earlier this month , the president authorized limited airstrikes on @entity31 targets and sent additional advisers to @entity9 to protect @entity22 personnel and minority groups threatened by the @entity101 extremists			1
@entity102 emphasized the @entity31 threat on thursday			2
" they marry ideology , a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess			0
they are tremendously well - funded , " he told reporters			0
" this is beyond anything that we 've seen			0
" broad - based approach @entity102 and @entity5 also said that defeating @entity31 requires a broad - based approach that includes forging an international coalition and better governance in @entity9 and @entity3 to build public opposition to the extremists			1
" political reform will make it harder for ( @entity31 ) to exploit sectarian divisions , " @entity102 said			2
the @entity22 and other powers will shore up @entity9 at the same time			0
the @entity22 should build a coalition against @entity31 that includes regional countries such as @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 that can contribute air power -- much of it provided by @entity22 , @entity78 said			1
" all agree at some level or another that @entity31 presents a threat , " he noted			0
risky move @entity22 bombs exploding in @entity3 also would allow @entity138 extremists to argue that @entity22 remains an imperialist bully			1
that could play into @entity31 ' hands			0
" you have an adversary that is so proud of its accomplishments and so driven by its ideology that they want to appear on the world stage as our peer , " said @entity142 , a former @entity143 counterterrorism official			0
strikes could boost their fund raising and recruiting			0
at the same time , @entity142 says , if the @entity22 wants to really hurt @entity31 , it has to strike at its base -- which is @entity3			1
but that also could empower @entity51 , who has long dismissed the uprising against his leadership as a fight against terrorists , @entity78 said			0
until now , @entity51 has allowed @entity31 to grow in @entity3 because it joins his government in fighting the anti-government forces			1
however , @entity31 fighters have taken over rebel - held territory and even some government - held areas , causing @entity51 to launch airstrikes against them in some places			2
@entity174 's strategy " this is basically two criminal gangs who often in effect collaborate but now have a difference over real money over who controls oil fields and the like , " @entity78 said of the relationship between @entity51 and @entity31			0
wiping out the @entity3 opposition would leave only @entity31 and @entity51 , who would then position himself to the @entity185 as the lesser of two evils and an ally in fighting the jihadists , @entity78 said			1
@entity22 public opinion intervention abroad has become unpopular with many @entity22 , weary from long wars in @entity9 and @entity192			0
@entity0 " needs to reassure people that this effort does not presage boots on the ground or some kind of repeat of the @entity9 experience , " @entity78 said			0
@entity16 called @entity0 " very deliberate toward the use of force			0
" " the @entity22 people also understand that there 's some threats that have to be dealt with , " he said			0
who is the @entity31 ? where are they ?			0

the @entity22 is gathering intel on the locations of @entity31 leadership in @entity3 , officials say
*ex-cia* official : @entity31 is empowered when @entity22 calls out , attacks them
administration officials leave open the possibility of airstrikes on @entity31 in @entity3
