-- a toy helicopter controlled by nothing but brainwaves could be available to the public just in time to hover under this year 's christmas tree			2
currently touted on crowd - funding website kickstarter -- where it has already exceeded its pledge goal twice over -- the @entity9 comes equipped with an electroencephalography ( @entity11 ) headset , capable of reading electrical activity along the scalp			1
" as you focus your mind on something -- whether it be a math equation or the lyrics of a song -- your brain produces electric signals , " explains @entity15 , ceo and co-founder of @entity17 , the @entity18 - based company behind the project			1
" the headset monitors those signals and converts them into flight commands , " he says			1
there are future plans to enable multi-directional control , but in its present incarnation signals sent from the brain can only be used to lift the helicopter off the ground			1
" when you concentrate , up it goes ; when you mentally relax , it comes back down again , " explains @entity15			2
aside from its obvious entertainment value , @entity17 are pitching the @entity9 as an educational toy that will help improve concentration and relaxation skills			1
according to @entity15 , the art of keeping mentally focused is inherently difficult to master			0
" if you 're learning how to ride a bike , there 's a very obvious , physical indication when you improve -- you stop falling off , " says the 34 - year - old computer science graduate			2
" it 's much harder to know when you 're concentrating properly and , to a lesser extent , relaxing , because there is little scope for accurate , real - time feedback			2
" @entity15 believes that by providing powerful visual reinforcement in the shape of his telekinesis - powered floating sphere , users will become better able to channel their attentions in other tasks			0
when it goes into mass production at the end of this month , the @entity9 will be available in two models			1
the first is designed to be used with mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones , which connect via @entity68 to the accompanying @entity11 headset , and communicate with sensors on board the helicopter			0
the second model , available later in the year , comes with a @entity74			0
the @entity74 acts as a home base and remote control unit for the @entity9 and features a custom - designed , reprogrammable micro-controller			1
infrared leds lining the rim of the @entity74 send signals to the helicopter			0
these can also be reprogrammed to control other infrared gadgets			0
" so instead of controlling the helicopter , you could modify the programming of the @entity74 to turn the volume up or down on your television , " @entity15 says			0
the idea behind the @entity74 is to encourage users to make the transition from a simple consumer to an active participant in the products they buy			0
" we want to stimulate curiosity about how it all works , and actively invite anyone who buys the @entity9 to take it apart , modify it and reprogram it as they see fit , " he says			2
as such , @entity17 will also freely distribute all material in relation to the project , from the source code to the hardware schematics to how - to guides for dismantling and reassembling the whole thing			1
" sure , it 's a fun toy first and foremost , but once the initial novelty wears off it does n't have to end up at the bottom of the toy box ... it 's yours to reinvent , " he says .			0

the @entity9 uses electrical brainwave signals to issue flight commands
@entity18 - based makers *puzzlebox* say the toy *enhances* ability to concentrate
to encourage future *adaptations* , all *software* and schematics for the @entity9 are open source
