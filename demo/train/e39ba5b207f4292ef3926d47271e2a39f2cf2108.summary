-- @entity2 newspaper columnist @entity1 accused @entity3 of taking " acting lessons " before his testimony at his murder trial			1
@entity3 has claimed that he accidentally killed his girlfriend , @entity7 after mistaking her for an intruder to his home in @entity10			1
i have to admit , as a criminal defense attorney , i found his testimony unusually well - focused and on - point as he attempted to accomplish what he needed to			1
it was this : to convince the judge ( there is no jury in this case ) that he was acting out of instinct and fear -- rather than anger and hatred -- when he fired four fatal shots through a locked bathroom door			2
is it not @entity3 ' right to figure out how to best present that position to the judge ? is it somehow wrong for a defendant to craft or polish his presentation to positively affect the judge 's ( or jury 's ) decision ? yes , it is his right , and no it 's not wrong ; welcome to the underbelly of litigation			1
however , it 's the same underbelly that exists in business and even in social interactions			2
we all learn even as children to speak properly , to " mind our manners " and to " put our best foot forward			0
" suggesting that people do n't prepare for or rehearse important interactions is not just folly ; it goes against what we 've been taught since we 've learned to listen			2
on that first date , we try to look as good as we can , be as funny as we can , appear as insightful as we can			0
before a job interview we study the employer and the industry			0
before asking for a raise , we present our value in the warmest light possible			2
good lawyers have spent their careers learning how to present their clients in the most favorable light possible during litigation			1
criminal defense lawyers learn how to be persuasive and genuine when presenting their side of the story			2
we are trained to represent clients , any clients , as best we can and to seek the proper result for that client			0
prosecutors know how to polish their presentations as well			0
in civil law , when many millions of dollars are on the line , corporate representatives plan for hours , days , weeks , months -- even years -- to properly present their side of the case			0
they take part in mock trial , the sole purpose of which is to identify and correct weaknesses in their presentation , to gain insight from how that presentation worked with mock jurors			0
back to the question at hand : did @entity3 have acting lessons ? this will now sound insincere , but i have never , not in 30 years of practice , had a client take " acting lessons " or any other lessons regarding how to testify			1
but i have spent hours with witnesses and clients reviewing with them how to present themselves and their story in the most compelling and believable way			1
but remember this : law enforcement officers also go through extensive training in how to present themselves in a courtroom , from subtleties as simple as turning toward the jury when answering a question to presenting their testimony in simple , easy - to - understand phrases , to raising and lowering their voices at just the right time			0
expert witnesses are paid well for their ability to communicate their testimony effectively and believably to a jury			0
so is it any less appropriate for @entity3 to have reviewed his testimony with his lawyers ? would it be wrong if @entity3 had the benefit of a " testimony presentation expert " ? the answer is no , it is not inappropriate , as long as @entity3 was telling the truth			1
the important question is : did he present his testimony in a way in which the judge believed he was sincere ? or will the judge believe he was coached and acting ? judges and jurors alike are not easily fooled , and they bring to the courtroom life experiences that prepare them to detect deception and insincerity			1
it is also the duty of the advocates on both sides of the story to advise or remind the fact finders that testimony is what it is : prepared , coached , rehearsed and presented as well as possible			0
my belief is that @entity3 was absolutely coached			1
i also believe the judge thinks so , too , and when she weighs @entity3 ' testimony , she will take into consideration that it was perhaps too well polished and that it was too well rehearsed			1
that was , after all , a significant goal of the blistering cross examination , to show that coaching			0
i say we trust in fact finders -- in this case the judge , and , in the @entity155 , the jurors -- and understand that they know how to balance the content of a testimony with the sincerity , or lack of sincerity , with which it was delivered .			0

@entity164 : *writer* charged murder defendant @entity3 took " acting lessons " for court
@entity164 : true , he seemed on - point , but why should n't he be ? he 's trying to show *innocence*
he says in litigation , as in life , we show ourselves in best light . lawyers indeed coach clients
@entity164 : police , prosecutors , witnesses do it , too . welcome to litigation . @entity3 is entitled
