-- @entity1 is a triple - nipple baby bottle , some extinct goat dna , and a @entity4 survival kit			0
is that really too much to ask ? not if you happened to walk past a particular neon - lit convenience store in downtown @entity8 -- the flashing sign in the window advertising " cash for genes			2
" inside the unremarkable 99 ¢ shop you 'd find the usual assortment of hair accessories , shoelaces , and cleaning products ; the only thing binding them together being their " @entity19 ! low ! " price			1
but take a closer look and you 'd also discover strange items from the future -- a universal language translator , a liquid cash injection kit , even some spacesuit lining ( for when those bothersome transgenic moths eat through your helmet )			2
this is the world according to the @entity33 -- a group of @entity35 designers using a mixture of expert reports and crowd - sourcing to create products anywhere from 10 to 10,000 years in the future			1
made in @entity8 now items from their " 99c @entity41 " -- a one - off installation where space - age objects were sold in an ordinary shop -- has gone on display in @entity48 's first state - run contemporary art gallery			1
the @entity50 power station of art -- a former power station turned museum overlooking @entity53 -- last week launched its @entity50 2013 exhibition , showcasing over 500 works from around the world			1
" we 're contributing 30 products that came from the 99 ¢ store -- very peculiar , bespoke future objects , " said @entity57 , co-founder of the @entity33			1
" by putting these ideas out there , we 're pushing the way people think about consumerism far beyond the immediate			0
it 'll be interesting to see how people 's reactions in @entity50 differ from those in @entity35			2
" @entity71 the surreal project is part of a growing movement in design called " @entity71 " -- which as the name suggests , involves creating products for the future			1
" the incorporation of futures thinking into the design world has picked up pace hugely since the mid- 2000s , " said @entity79 , professor of foresight and design at @entity82			0
" with massive global challenges looming , like climate change , peak oil , and economic volatility , we need to develop a cultural capacity for thinking ahead and creating options -- so we are n't just reacting to crisis after crisis			0
" but " @entity71 " is n't just about developing environmentally - friendly cars or search - and - rescue robots			0
as the @entity33 showed , it can also be found in the ordinary 99 ¢ store down the road , or what candy describes as " @entity71			1
" " the 99 ¢ store project is interesting because it 's a rare invitation to imagine the future 's mundane side , " he added			1
" popular notions of the future often get stuck in a kind of glossy rut - gleaming buildings and whiz - bang inventions -- and it 's not often that we see the futures of everyday life brought into focus			2
" design so how did the @entity33 create their intriguing objects ? the group -- comprising 33 - year - olds @entity57 and @entity119 , who met after studying design interactions at @entity123 's @entity122 -- put the call out for members of the public interested in " futuring			0
" on a snowy day in @entity35 , they gathered 40 people -- ranging from seven - year - old kids to middle aged architects -- and asked them to read think - tank reports on the future			2
" the forecasts were from a broad spectrum -- obesity as a percentage of the @entity139 population , robots in the homes of @entity142 , shortages of chocolate , acceptance of drug use , and technology , " said @entity57			0
the participants then wrote a short story imagining a world where these forecasts came to life			0
a table was laid out with various items from other 99 ¢ stores , which they used to create new products for their fantastical fables			1
" we got some very bleak futures where environmental scenarios were really devastating , like the dying out of coral reefs			0
so products like the " @entity165 " responded to those issues , " said @entity57			2
" at the same time there were people who imaged a future of great possibilities			0
one of the children was responding to the idea of robots in all our homes , who would help her brush her pet chinchilla			0
so the product she made was an arm attachment for your chinchilla - brushing robot			0
" what next ? there 's an interesting parallel in seeing objects from the 99 ¢ store of the future going on display in @entity48 -- one of the world 's biggest makers of cheap , mass - produced products			1
" it seems appropriate that the project be brought from @entity35 to @entity50 , " said candy			2
" it prompts us to think about the supply chains - in which @entity48 is a critical link - which make the phenomenon of 99 ¢ stores possible in the developed world			1
" so could these fantastical 99 ¢ items become reality ? " we 're not asking people to predict , but more to dream , " said @entity57			1
" or produce nightmares , if that 's what will help us make decisions in the present			0

what would 99 ¢ store of the future look like ? two @entity35 designers found out
created *hundreds* of futuristic products , and sold them in ordinary shop
now surreal items have gone on show in @entity223 2013 exhibition
