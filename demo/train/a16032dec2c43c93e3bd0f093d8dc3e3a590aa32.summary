@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the rolling hills of northern @entity1 , about 180 miles south of the @entity5 border , lies a community that stands out for its religious roots			1
the houses in this community surrounded by peach and apple orchards look more like homes you would find in the @entity13 than in @entity1			1
on top of a hill stands a gleaming white @entity17 temple , a rarity in this largely @entity20 country			2
@entity21 is a resident in this community called @entity0 and a practicing @entity17			2
the 50 - year - old owner of orchards and a fruit packing plant says his family descends from @entity17 who settled in this area more than 125 years ago			2
" they established the apple orchards , the peach orchards , farms , ranches , and that 's basically what we do today , " @entity21 said			0
" we come from a hardworking family			0
we come from honest people			0
" @entity21 tied with @entity38 in latest poll @entity41 's great - grandfather led the first group of @entity17 to the state of @entity44 , the same @entity17 to whom the family of @entity5 presidential candidate @entity46 traces its heritage			1
in fact , @entity46 's father , @entity49 -- who also ran for president in the @entity5 -- was born in this area himself in a town called @entity54			1
and @entity21 is @entity46 's second cousin			1
@entity55 is so proud of @entity46 's political career that he managed to get a @entity21 bumper sticker sent to @entity1 which he proudly displays on his pickup truck			1
he also has a @entity21 campaign sign on his window			0
and he says he ca n't understand why @entity46 's religion is an issue for some people			1
" i think it 's a misunderstanding on their part			0
i know people try to use that against @entity46 , but they just ca n't find anything on him to dig up about him , " @entity21 says			1
the first @entity71 arrived in this part of @entity1 around 1885			1
they came from @entity74 , said @entity75 , where as @entity17 , they felt they had to deal with religious persecution and the controversy over polygamy			1
there are still about 40 members of the @entity21 family here in @entity0 who trace their roots back to those first settlers			0
@entity88 is also a resident of @entity0			0
the 69 - year - old is @entity46 's second cousin as well			1
he says that , among the first settlers , " it was actually a very small percentage of the church that practiced polygamy			0
" the community has n't practiced polygamy since the church banned it in the late 1800s			1
his peach and apple orchards , together with those owned by other members of the @entity21 family , are a crucial source of employment in this part of @entity1			1
a fruit packing cooperative owned by several of the @entity71 is also an important economic engine in the community			0
the @entity21 family and other @entity17 settlers built a bilingual school in 1904 that is attended by the children of all the members of the @entity17 community			0
@entity88 says @entity46 himself has never been here , but the fruit grower says he saw him once in the @entity5			1
" i was on a plane one time from @entity114 to @entity115 and he was on it			0
my wife kept trying to get me to go meet him , but i guess i was a little timid and thought , ' well when we get off in @entity115 i 'll meet him , ' but we got off and he went on to @entity122 , " @entity88 said			0
as much as he admires his second cousin , @entity88 says he disagrees with his position on immigration			2
" there should be guest worker programs for these [ @entity1 ] people that are practically starving to death to be able to go over there and do work that the @entity13 people would not do , " @entity21 said			2
more than anything , this branch of the @entity21 family defines itself by the teachings of its church , and feels allegiance to both @entity1 and the @entity5			2
@entity88 says he knows the national sports of both countries equally well			0
but when asked what country he would root for in a soccer match between the @entity5 and @entity1 , he replies " @entity1 ! " with a quick smile			2
" we have a loyalty to this country			0
we were born here , " @entity21 says .			0

@entity146 @entity46 has cousins in @entity1
