@entity0 -- watching president @entity2 react to what he called his " shellacking " in the midterm elections had me remembering then - president @entity7 back on november 9 , 1994 -- the day after he and his fellow @entity8 lost control of the @entity10 and the @entity11			1
i was then @entity1 's senior @entity10 correspondent and i vividly remember attending @entity7 's news conference			1
like @entity2 this week , he was humble in defeat			1
none of us knew what to expect from @entity7 on that day 16 years ago , but he came out and was direct -- he said that he took responsibility for the political disaster			2
on wednesday , @entity2 was clearly somber and sad			2
but like @entity7 in 1994 he answered questions for nearly an hour			1
what a difference it was for both presidents from their election days			0
@entity7 was in @entity25 in november 1992 when he was elected : @entity2 was in @entity26 on november 4 , 2008 , when he was elected -- exactly two years ago today			1
how quickly their political fortunes changed			0
a fundamental lesson in @entity31 politics is that things can -- and often do -- change rather dramatically and very quickly			0
and that means that things can dramatically change over the next two years as well			0
so the issue for @entity2 is what he does next			2
does he follow @entity7 's playbook and move toward the center -- what was called " triangulation " ? will @entity2 separate himself from the liberal base of the @entity8 -- as @entity7 did ? as much as @entity2 does n't want to do that , he 's a politician , and politicians have a very powerful instinct for their own political survival , especially when they face re-election in two years			1
he pushed for welfare reform and a balanced budget -- to the deep concern of his liberal base			0
but he beat @entity51 and was re-elected .			0

@entity53 attended @entity7 's 1994 news conference after @entity8 lost @entity55
*similarities* between @entity7 's *situation* and @entity2 's are striking , @entity53 **writes**
@entity2 faces a *choice* : " @entity61 " like @entity7 or forge your own path , @entity53 **writes**
