@entity0 -- two top international cricket players from @entity3 were found guilty tuesday of plotting to cheat and to take bribes in a major match against @entity6 last summer			1
@entity7 and @entity8 could potentially go to prison for up to seven years for the criminal offenses , part of a scandal that rocked the international sport			1
a third player , @entity14 , pleaded guilty to the same charges			1
the court barred the press from reporting his plea until the jury reached their verdict on @entity7 and @entity8 , for fear of affecting the deliberations			1
they are due to be sentenced on wednesday			2
" this is a case of cheating , pure and simple , " metropolitan police detective chief superintendent @entity24 said in a statement after the verdict			2
" the defendants , who are world - class cricketers , sought to cheat to enhance their substantial legitimate earnings			2
" he said they had " let down the cricketing world , their fans and the hardworking people that buy tickets to watch			0
" " they were role models to countless children around the world and have betrayed their trust , " the officer said			0
the @entity42 were accused of spot fixing , which involves deliberately throwing parts of a game rather than the whole match			0
prosecutors accused @entity7 and @entity8 of taking part in a betting scam , allegedly arranged by @entity50 , during a match between @entity3 and @entity6 played at the @entity53 's cricket ground in @entity0			1
the @entity54 , the @entity55 tabloid that first reported the allegations , said players deliberately bowled " no balls , " or fouls , at specific points in the game and that the alleged ringleader made 150,000 pounds ( about $ 230,000 ) in the scam			1
the @entity54 has since folded in an unrelated scandal			1
but @entity24 praised the newspaper 's work , saying it was " unlikely " the corruption would have been exposed without " the good work of investigative journalism ; and as an investigator i acknowledge the skill involved in such work			0
" prosecutors used audio and video recordings the newspaper made secretly last year involving @entity50 , a 36 - year - old businessman from @entity0			2
in one , @entity50 is heard telling an unknown contact it is " not a problem " to fix the result of a match , adding : " @entity81 , you know how many [ players ] i have got , you know that they do it			0
" the jury also heard a series of audio and video recordings of conversations and meetings between @entity50 and a reporter from the newspaper , who was posing as a rich @entity93 businessman			0
one of the recordings showed the reporter handing over $ 140,000 in a @entity0 hotel room that had been fitted with secret cameras			2
@entity50 is heard to give the reporter precise details of events in the match , due to start the following day , that would be rigged by the @entity42 players			0
specifically , he describes three no - balls -- illegal deliveries -- that the @entity42 bowlers would concede at particular points in the match			0
the price of fixing a no - ball , @entity50 was heard to say , is $ 10,000 ; he went on to tell the undercover reporter that his contact in @entity93 made four to five times that amount by betting on no - balls			2
the jury was then shown extended clips from the @entity53 's match , during which the @entity42 bowlers did exactly as @entity50 had promised			0
before one of the no - balls , the cameras even showed @entity7 , who was captaining the @entity42 team , consult with @entity14 , the bowler			1
earlier in the trial , the jury was told the betting market in the @entity125 subcontinent is " breathtaking in size			1
" conservative estimates , the prosecution said , puts the value of the market at between $ 40 billion to $ 50 billion dollars per year			1
@entity131 , an anti-corruption official at the @entity132 , told the court that the betting market had developed over the years from a focus on fixing match results , to spot fixing : contriving small events within the game , like no balls , or particular patterns of scoring			1
@entity8 and @entity7 denied the charges			1
@entity50 was not on trial ; the jury was told there is " nothing sinister " about this apparent inconsistency			0
@entity149 , the parent company of the now - defunct @entity54 , said tuesday 's guilty verdicts were to the credit of its reporter , @entity152 , who now works for the @entity154			1
" the convictions secured today are a clear example of where his professional investigative journalism has served the public interest , " a spokeswoman said in a statement			0
the @entity132 was happy with the outcome , having earlier suspended the trio for periods between five to seven years			2
" we hope that this verdict is seen as a further warning to any individual who might , for whatever reason , be tempted to engage in corrupt activity within our sport , " the ruling body 's chief executive @entity165 said			0
" i am satisfied that we have worked closely with the @entity173 and @entity174 throughout this entire process , and i believe that this case has shown that it is possible for criminal authorities and sports bodies to cooperate with each other , in difficult circumstances , in the best interests of the sport and the public at large			0
" @entity1 's @entity185 and @entity186 contributed to this report .			0

the outcome is a credit to reporting by @entity54 , its parent firm says
@entity7 and @entity8 are guilty of plotting to cheat and take bribes
@entity14 earlier pleaded guilty to the same charges
the @entity125 betting market is worth up to $ *50b* a year , a cricket official estimates
