-- the presents had been opened ; the wrapping paper was stuffed in the trash bin			2
watching his 2 - year - old daughter @entity6 playing with her brand new @entity8 toys , @entity4 was suddenly struck by a thought : " i need to be here to walk her down the aisle			1
" startled by the idea , he turned and caught his reflection in the window , noticing his substantial arms , belly and neck			2
it was a sight he had grown accustomed to as the years passed , but on this particular day , a new resolve animated him			2
" i can control this , " he thought			2
" and i 've never really tried before			2
" at that moment , he made a promise to himself that he would lose the extra pounds -- he did n't know how just yet , but he would do it all the same			1
at 6 feet 1 inch tall , he weighed 343 pounds			1
it was n't always this way			2
" i graduated ( high school ) at 250 pounds , but not necessarily fat			1
i was from a very small town , and football was king			1
i started lifting weights at about 13 , " @entity4 said			1
the problem was , " i never did any cardio			2
i could care less about running			2
... i ate whatever i wanted			2
" that was the status quo until after he graduated college and got married			2
" i lost my father to liver disease when he was 55 , " @entity4 said			1
" i think i was subconsciously using food as a coping mechanism because i loved to cook , and i loved to eat , and i still do			2
... hindsight is 20 - 20			0
" the day after his " aha " moment -- december 28 , 2011 -- @entity4 joined a new gym near his house			1
he also scheduled an appointment with the doctor for @entity47 2012			1
the doctor performed a routine checkup , noting that @entity4 was already on medication for both high blood pressure and high cholesterol			1
but @entity4 wanted one more question answered			1
near the end of the physical , he requested that the doctor test his blood sugar			1
it was 277 , almost 200 % above normal			0
it was official : he had diabetes			0
" i told the doctor , and this is a direct quote , ' i 'm going to lose over 100 pounds , and i 'm going to cure myself of diabetes			1
' " the doctor was skeptical , telling him that many people decide to lose weight on @entity69 's , and that very few succeed			1
@entity4 decided to try anyway			1
the first day of his new exercise regimen began with a shrill alarm at 5:30 a.m. he had made a commitment not to take time away from his family , so early morning workouts were the logical choice			0
when he arrived at the gym , it was completely empty			0
immediately , he was struck by the astounding variety of exercise equipment that was available , and his complete lack of experience with any of it			0
" i did n't know what speed to try , what incline			0
i just tried the treadmill because it seemed simplest			0
i was terribly out of shape , did n't know what a good calorie burn was , how long to go -- i did n't know anything			0
" even so , he kept it up , five days a week			0
his wife , @entity93 , was surprised at his commitment			0
" he was so determined , " she said , " and any small positive change in his body kept him moving forward			0
" the most difficult obstacle for @entity4 was changing his diet			1
" once you 're addicted to food , you 're always addicted to food , " he said			0
" if somebody put a fresh plate of brownies in front of me , it would be just as hard to say no as it was at the beginning			0
( but ) you can never outwork a poor diet			0
" @entity4 began keeping track of his caloric intake with a smart phone app , limiting himself to 2,000 calories a day			1
he also tried to find healthy versions of his favorite foods : cheese made with skim milk , pizza made with wheat dough and even black bean brownies			0
over the course of the year , @entity4 made swift progress			1
as the holiday season rolled around again , he made another trip to the doctor			1
when the results came in for his blood pressure and sugar level tests , both he and he doctor were stunned			2
" the doctor called all the nurses and doctors and pediatricians out of their rooms and said ' this guy actually did it , ' " @entity4 remembered proudly			1
" but that was not the end			0
today , @entity4 weighs 190 pounds			1
in order to maintain his healthy lifestyle , he continues to wear a calorie tracker every day			0
he also keeps two pictures beside his bed , one from before his weight loss and one after , reminding himself every morning and every night , " never again			0
" @entity4 also continues to look for new ways to improve his personal fitness , describing himself as " a fitness dork			1
" earlier this year , he participated in his first triathlon			0
after training " like crazy , " he snagged first place			0
from 343 pounds to a lean 190			1
from not knowing how to use a treadmill to winning a triathlon			0
from " newbie " to " fitness dork			0
" in a short time , @entity4 made a drastic change			1
after that , he just kept going .			0

@entity4 was a fit football player until he lost his father to liver disease
@entity4 told his doctor on @entity47 2012 he would lose 100 pounds
@entity4 lost *153* pounds , now weighs 190
