@entity1 administration officials said monday the federal government would not become a willing partner in the state of @entity6 's efforts to arrest undocumented people -- unless those immigrants meet federal government criteria			1
and they said the administration is rescinding agreements that allow some @entity6 law enforcement officers to enforce federal immigration laws			1
the administration made the announcement hours after monday 's @entity17 decision on whether states can enforce immigration laws			0
issues and ruling at a glance in a conference call with reporters , an administration official said the administration will not allow @entity6 's immigration priorities to become the @entity29 's priorities			1
the official said while @entity29 expected more calls from @entity6 authorities , it will not increase staffing in @entity6 to deal with them			1
" we have limited resources			0
it does n't make sense ... to spend those resources in a scattershot or random fashion			0
instead they need to be focused on individuals who pose a public safety threat or challenge the integrity of our borders , and going forth that is how we anticipate handling our response to ... @entity6 's law , " he said			2
accordingly , he said , federal officials will not respond to the scene of state or local traffic stops or similar law enforcement encounters to enforce immigration laws unless the individual meets @entity29 enforcement priorities			1
to meet those priorities , the individual must be a convicted criminal or a recent border crosser , or must have been removed from the @entity63 previously and re-entered unlawfully			1
@entity29 will continue to comply with its legal requirement to verify , by telephone , the individual 's immigration status , officials said			0
states affected by ruling the administration also said it is rescinding the so - called 287 ( g ) agreements with the state of @entity6 that allowed some local police departments to enforce federal immigration laws			1
under the 287 ( g ) program , state and local law enforcement agencies entered into a partnership with @entity29 's @entity80 and were delegated authority for immigration enforcement within their jurisdictions			2
the program was initiated under the @entity87 administration , which heralded it as a top immigration enforcement tool			0
but the progam has fallen into disfavor with the @entity1 administration , which said in its 2013 budget proposal that it intended to phase out the program , an administration official said			0
five things we learned @entity6 gov. @entity97 responded to the end of the 287 ( g ) agreements with an angry statement monday			0
" as though we needed any more evidence , president @entity1 has demonstrated anew his utter disregard for the safety and security of the @entity6 people			0
within the last two hours , i have been notified the @entity1 administration has revoked the 287 ( g ) agreement under the authority of which @entity6 law enforcement officers have partnered with the federal government in the enforcement of immigration law , " the statement said			1
" since 2006 , the @entity63 @entity29 credits the 287 ( g ) program with identifying nearly 300,000 potentially - removable aliens nationwide			0
@entity80 has trained and certified more than 1,500 state and local officers to assist in the enforcement of immigration law , including many in @entity6 , " the statement added			2
" in fact , even as the president was wiping out @entity6 's 287 ( g ) agreements , the @entity80 website itself continued to herald the collaborative approach of the 287 ( g ) program , noting , ' @entity125 and criminal activity are most effectively combated through a multi-agency / multi-authority approach that encompasses federal , state and local resources , skills and expertise			2
' " the @entity133 announced it has set up a telephone hotline and e-mail address for the public to report potential civil rights concerns related to the implementation of the @entity140 provision requiring immigration status verification during certain law enforcement encounters			1
the hotline number is 855 - 353 - 1010 and the e-mail address is @entity145			0
a @entity133 official said the @entity6 hotline was set up in reaction to the @entity17 's ruling			1
" the hotline was not previously set up because the provision had not gone into effect , " the official said			0
" in @entity157 , we similarly set up the hotline when its immigration law went into effect , " the official said , referring to a hotline set up in that state late last year in response to @entity157 's immigration reform law law .			2
