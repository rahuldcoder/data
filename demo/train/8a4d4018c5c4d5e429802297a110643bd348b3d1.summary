@entity0 -- millions of phone calls have been made			0
thousands of yard signs are posted on @entity5 lawns			0
television ads blanket the @entity8 airwaves			2
all of this frenetic activity in tuesday 's gubernatorial recall in @entity8 comes at an unprecedented price tag : upward of $ 63 million , and that does n't take into account money raised the last three weeks that has n't been registered yet			1
" when we come up with a final tally for this race , it 's going to be in the $ 70 ( million ) to $ 80 million range , " predicted @entity15 , who runs @entity16 , a nonpartisan campaign watchdog group			1
@entity23 's fate comes down to ground game the money raised in the recall already shatters @entity8 's record of $ 37 million , set just 18 months ago when @entity23 gov. @entity23 was first elected			1
it 's a mind - blowing amount of money , especially for a state as small and inexpensive politically as @entity8			1
recall vote is judgment day for @entity5 governor " this is way out of proportion to a state this size , " said @entity15 , sitting in his @entity36 office surrounded by workers entering a continuous stream of fund - raising data onto his group 's website			1
what 's also out of proportion : @entity23 has raised 7Â½ times that of his @entity48 challenger , @entity47			1
to date , @entity47 has raised just under $ 4 million			1
@entity23 has pulled in $ 30.5 million			1
that wide disparity can be attributed in part to a quirk in the election law			0
public officials in @entity8 who are targeted for a recall are allowed to raised unlimited sums of money until the recall is formally set			1
in @entity23 's case , that was march			1
so a lot of rich @entity61 , seeing the @entity8 recall battle as a preview of the presidential race , wrote @entity23 huge checks			1
what 's at stake in @entity8 ? @entity8 billionaire @entity68 gave @entity23 more than $ 500,000			1
@entity70 @entity69 , who bankrolled the infamous 2004 " @entity73 " attacks against @entity72 , also contributed half of $ 1 million directly to @entity23			1
@entity76 casino magnate @entity75 and @entity78 millionaire @entity77 each donated $ 250,000			0
in fact , 70 % of @entity23 's donations in the last month came from outside @entity5 -- hundreds of thousands of contributors large and small from all over the country			1
@entity83 has raised money for @entity8 @entity61 for 25 years			1
he said when former @entity61 gov. @entity85 was on the ballot in 2000 , he had 50,000 people on his donor list			0
" it was actually controversial , " @entity83 said			0
@entity23 's list of at least 250,000 dwarfs that one			1
@entity83 remembers potential donors laughing at him when he tried to raise money from out of state for a @entity8 political campaign			2
" anything over $ 100 was a hard ask			0
now apparently you can ask for a million dollars and get it in the same moment , which is amazing , " @entity83 said			0
he said he knew things were different with the recall when he went to a party in @entity103 several months ago and met people from @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity70 and @entity107 who had already contributed to help @entity23 beat back the recall			2
" i was shocked , " @entity83 recalled			0
individual contributions only tell part of the story of big bucks in @entity8 's recall			2
outside groups supporting both candidates flooded the state with some $ 25 million			1
they look like a who 's who of @entity0 special interests --- from @entity120 to the @entity121			0
when the dollars are tallied up in this category , @entity48 outside groups supporting @entity47 will have outspent those backing @entity23			1
labor unions , which have an enormous stake in the recall since the backlash against @entity23 began when he all but did away with collective bargaining rights for public employees , have given $ 8 million in traceable donations to help @entity47			1
it 's likely unions have given much more to @entity48 groups not required to disclose their donors			2
opinion : fix , do n't destroy , public worker unions the @entity139 is another big contributor -- at least $ 9 million , including $ 1 million from @entity61 high roller @entity141			2
these groups register and advertise with names that appear to be homegrown			0
we are @entity8 is organized and funded mostly by national unions in @entity0			2
@entity8 is really an arm of the @entity139			0
then there are the stealth super @entity149 whose donors are anonymous			0
they have given $ 8.5 million			0
the @entity16 lists eight such groups on its website			0
most , such as @entity154 and the @entity155 , are groups on the right trying to help @entity23			2
one , @entity158 , is trying to help push @entity23 out			0
again , the donors are anonymous			0
" elections are being poisoned here , but the people of @entity8 ca n't know who is paying for most of the poison , " @entity15 said			0
the irony is that despite the tens of millions raised and spent on the recall election , it is an open question whether it will make a real difference			0
@entity8 's electorate is so polarized , that public and party polls suggest most people 's minds are already made up			2
what both parties agree on , however , is that the extra campaign cash does help where it matters most : identifying voters and making sure they get to the polls on @entity178 .			0

to date , gov. @entity23 has raised 7Â½ times that of @entity182 , @entity47
watchdog group expects final recall tally to be $ 70 million - $ 80 million
some 70 % of @entity23 's donations in last month came from outside @entity8
outside groups backing both candidates flooded state with some $ 25 million
