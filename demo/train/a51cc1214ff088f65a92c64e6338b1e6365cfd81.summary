-- a road trip , @entity2 and a drunken @entity3			1
sounds like a recipe for a summer blockbuster , right ? that 's what @entity2 and her husband , @entity8 , are hoping to pull off with their july 2 comedy , " @entity12			1
" the pair co-wrote and co-produced the feature about an unhinged woman who 's suffered a job loss and an unfaithful husband in too short a time span			2
@entity2 stars as the titular troubled @entity12 , while @entity8 took a seat in the director 's chair for the first time			1
and according to the duo , they have a peculiar dream to thank for their inspiration			0
" apparently ( @entity8 ) goes and has really strange dreams about alcoholic grandmothers , but it 's working out great for us , " @entity2 joked at the movie 's june 30 premiere			1
" i know it sounds a little bit creepy , " @entity8 added , " but i came downstairs and i just told @entity2 , ' would you want to do a road trip movie ? ' and " a mere seven years later , " here they are , with " @entity12 " having ridden @entity2 's reputation for perfectly executed physical comedy right to the top of this summer 's " must - see " list			1
the only nightmare in the realization of their literal dream comedy is that the critics are n't laughing			1
@entity47 's called it " a well - meaning personal project that never rises above the level of amiable mediocrity , " and the @entity49 was n't any kinder			2
" there 's only one genuinely funny scene in ' @entity12 , ' and of course it 's the first			1
" rather than a production team , the @entity49 continues , " @entity12 " needed " an intervention			0
" @entity58 thought the marketing campaign 's emphasis on just one scene -- you know the one , where she 's robbing a fast - food restaurant of its pie -- was because if " anyone understood what the actual movie consisted of , they 'd probably stay away in droves			0
... ' @entity12 ' is a boring , unfunny road movie that limps along idly , consisting of a string of nonsensical set pieces and halfhearted stabs at character development that come across as off - putting and odd			0
as soon as our screening ended , a woman behind us sighed and said , ' that was uncomfortable			0
' we could n't agree more			0
" the @entity83 does n't expect " @entity12 " to have a long ride through the summer , suspecting that @entity2 's fans will show up initially before the title fizzles out			1
" the film progresses from merely unfunny to unconvincing to dull , " thr reviews			0
" it 's a waste of a good cast as well as a serious trip wire for @entity2 , who may know what 's best for her talents but , on the evidence , needs a deft - handed outsider to make sure she 's maximizing them			2
" no wonder @entity100 sympathetically acknowledges that " it 's hard out here for a @entity12			2
" the movie 's script is " lumpy " and the supporting actors " never quite get to tap into what they can do , " @entity100 observes , but at the very least , " even when the material falls short , ( @entity2 's ) never not worth watching			2
