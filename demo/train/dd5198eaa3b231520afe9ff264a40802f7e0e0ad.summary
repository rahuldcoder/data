-- it is the ultimate breeding ground for any @entity3 star of the future , and a medium endorsed by one of the sport 's greatest drivers , @entity6			1
right up until his tragic death in 1994 , the three - time world champion from @entity10 still raced go - karts , a rough and ready forerunner for those youngsters hoping to make the giant leap to the multi-million - dollar arena of @entity3			1
@entity6 's passion for karts is shared by @entity19 , who started on his path to stardom as part of the all - conquering @entity23 team by speeding round miniature tracks as a teen			1
according to the @entity27 , who still squeezes his giant frame into a go - kart every once in a while , there is no better place to see if kids have what it takes to thrive in the fast - paced world of motorsport			2
" karting is very purist if you like , it 's very basic , " @entity19 , who was second fastest in practice for sunday 's @entity39 , told @entity0			1
" @entity6 was still a huge fan right until the end			1
" for him he really enjoyed it and he said he had some of his best racing in go - karts and he had some of his toughest opposition in go - karts , so there 's no better endorsement than that			2
" i suppose it 's like learning new languages when you 're young			0
karting is the best way for you to get a feel of how to race each other , dealing with the competition , dealing with winning , dealing with losing , and you soak up so much at a young age and learn very fast			0
" all of @entity3 's stellar names , such as double world champions @entity67 and @entity69 , @entity71 's @entity70 and seven - time drivers ' championship winner @entity72 , started out on karting tracks			2
@entity6 , one of the sport 's most dynamic drivers , became transfixed with an improvised go - kart made for him as a four - year - old by his father using old parts of an old lawnmower			1
and though there can be little comparison between the speed and the danger of the two driving disciplines , @entity19 insists the challenge presented by karting is one that still excites him			2
" the difference between go - karts and @entity3 is obviously quite extreme			2
it 's from the junior , the most basic form to the most extreme form , " the 36 - year - old said			1
" but a lot of @entity3 drivers , including myself , still love driving karts because it 's very , very raw			1
" they still give us a great feel of adrenalin and sensation of speed even though they 're not as powerful as what we race week in , week out , but we are low to the ground , you 've got to be very precise -- all the things we have to deal with in our profession			0
" talent on the track is one thing but @entity19 says it is vital to have an understanding of the financial workings of motorsport even from an early age			0
anyone who reaches the top will reap the rewards that come with @entity3 success , but it can be an expensive hobby to fund at the start of a driver 's career			1
" it 's not a cheap sport , obviously , so you 've got to try to find sponsorship if you can to help mum and dad pay for your go - kart tires and go - kart engines , " he said			0
" if you can , have a good nous and good awareness for the sponsorship side of things as well			0
i know they 're only young but it 's important for them to understand that			0
" @entity19 's first love was motorbikes , but his switch to four wheels as a 14 - year - old paid instant dividends as he won his state go - karting championship in @entity154			1
but aside from the titles , the thing he most cherishes about his time in the junior ranks of motorsport was traveling round @entity27 with his father , who was otherwise kept busy at work			0
it was n't until @entity19 started to enjoy success on a more prestigious stage that he thought his dream of becoming a @entity3 driver could turn into a reality			1
" there was definitely a moment when i was young and it clicked and i wanted to be a driver at the highest level , " he said			0
" i was completely dreaming then and every day i was dreaming about how far i could get in the sport			0
" no - one 's that arrogant when they 're racing go - karts that ( they think ) for sure i 'm going to be a world champion one day or i 'm going to race @entity3 or i 'm going to do this			1
" it 's just a process and you get more confidence and you win and you keep moving up			0
i think it 's not until you start getting to @entity183 and winning races over there that you feel that you can go all the way			0
" because it 's in your wildest dreams that you 'd ever get to race a @entity3 car when you 're racing karts			2

@entity23 's @entity3 driver @entity19 tells @entity0 of his love for go - karting
the @entity27 cut his teeth on karts at the start of his motorsport career
@entity19 says *legendary* @entity10 driver @entity6 was a huge fan of karting
the 36 - year - old says karting is a " pure " form of racing and is " very , very raw "
