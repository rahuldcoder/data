-- two @entity2 school administrators were due to appear in federal court thursday to face contempt charges for saying a prayer at a school luncheon			1
rep. @entity7 is one of three members of the @entity9 backing the school officials			0
@entity11 , principal of @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity2 , and school athletic director @entity14 are accused of violating a consent decree banning employees of @entity18 schools from endorsing religion			1
they face a nonjury trial before @entity23 district judge @entity22			0
if convicted , they could be sentenced to up to six months in prison and fined , subject to sentencing guidelines			1
defense attorneys have said it is it outrageous @entity11 and @entity14 are facing prosecution for " a simple prayer			0
" but the @entity32 , whose lawsuit led to the consent decree , maintains students have a right to be free from administrators who foist their personal religious beliefs on them			1
however , an @entity32 representative said the organization " never suggested " people should go to jail for violating the decree , and the organization is not involved in the criminal proceedings			1
the @entity32 filed suit last year against the school district in northwest @entity2 on behalf of two @entity13 students who alleged that " officials regularly promoted religion and led prayers at school events , " according to an @entity32 statement			1
both parties approved the consent decree put in place january 9 under which district and school officials are " permanently prohibited from promoting , advancing , endorsing , participating in or causing prayers during or in conjunction with school events , " the @entity32 said			1
@entity11 was a party in the initial lawsuit , and his attorney was among those approving the consent decree , according to the organization			1
in addition , the court required that all district employees receive a copy			0
but on january 28 , " @entity11 asked @entity14 to offer a prayer of blessing during a school - day luncheon for the dedication of a new field house at @entity12 , " according to court documents			2
" @entity14 complied with the request and offered the prayer at the event			0
it appears this was a school - sponsored event attended by students , faculty and community members			2
" attorneys from @entity88 , a conservative legal group helping defend @entity11 and @entity14 , have said that attendees included booster club members and other adults who helped the field house project -- all " consenting adults			0
" three @entity23 lawmakers who are members of the @entity9 have written a letter in support of the two school administrators , saying that " many of @entity23 's @entity98 were resolute in their faiths , and the impact of such is evident in the @entity101 , the @entity102 and many of their writings			2
" the letter from @entity106			0
@entity107 , @entity108 ; @entity7 , @entity110 - @entity109 ; and @entity111 , @entity2 , said the congressmen were writing as members of the @entity9			2
" the tradition of offering prayer in @entity23 has become so interwoven into our nation 's spiritual heritage that to charge someone criminally for engaging in such a practice would astonish the men who founded this country on religious liberty , " the lawmakers wrote .			0
