@entity2 became more isolated tuesday than it has been at any time since the end of the @entity4 after new , hard - hitting sanctions were announced by the @entity6 and the @entity1 , @entity1 officials said			1
@entity1 president @entity7 said the measures would take an " even bigger bite " out of the stagnant @entity2 economy than sanctions @entity18 and the @entity6 had already implemented against @entity2 over its disputed annexation of @entity10 and its support of @entity13 rebels fighting the @entity15 government			1
" the major sanctions we 're announcing today will continue to ratchet up the pressure on @entity2 including the cronies and companies supporting @entity2 's illegal activities in the @entity15 , " he said from the @entity20			1
" in other words , today @entity2 is once again isolating itself from the international community , setting back decades of genuine progress			2

the @entity6 sanctions also will block new arms contracts between @entity36 and @entity2 , prohibit the export of @entity36 goods that can be used for both civilian and military purposes and limit the export of energy - related equipment , the @entity6 said in a written statement tuesday evening			1
the @entity6 had previously been reluctant to issue harsher sanctions against @entity2 because both regions rely on one another for about $ 500 billion in trade and investment each year , according to @entity90			1
" it is meant as a strong warning : illegal annexation of territory and deliberate destabilization of a neighboring sovereign country can not be accepted in 21st century @entity36 , " the @entity93 's statement reads			0

it does not have to be this way , " @entity7 said			2
