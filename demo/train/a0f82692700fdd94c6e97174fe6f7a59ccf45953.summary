-- @entity2 lawmakers gave final approval to a measure that requires a woman to wait 72 hours from her initial doctor 's visit before she gets an abortion			1
the @entity10 - controlled @entity9 voted 111 - 39 in favor of the legislation late wednesday			1
gov. @entity13 , a @entity14 , has not said whether he 'll sign it			1
if the governor signs the bill into law , it will triple the time a woman has to wait to have an abortion in the state			2

@entity23 , who sponsored the bill known as @entity32 , said the legislation would give the woman more time to review her decision			0
" this bill is a way to give a potential mother some additional time to think about this life - altering decision , and to talk to family and friends who can help provide support during what is undoubtedly a difficult and emotional time , " @entity23 said in a statement			2
" this bill is really an effort to balance the rights of the mother with the rights of the unborn child			0
we are not denying the mother her rights , but simply asking her to give more thought before making a decision that she may later regret			0
" abortion rights advocates slammed the bill , describing it as an intrusion on personal lives			0
" governor @entity13 must veto this bill and stand firmly with a woman 's right to make her own private medical decisions , including the decision of whether to have an abortion , in consultation with her doctor , " said @entity57 , president of @entity58			1
but anti-abortion group @entity66 said the measure is long overdue			0
it " will save babies and protect all women , both adults and minors , from abortion clinics seeking to make a profit on an abortion , " it said in a statement			0
the @entity77 approved the bill tuesday in a 22 - 9 vote after @entity80 decided to forgo a filibuster , @entity0 affiliate @entity76 reported			2
if it 's signed into law , @entity2 will join @entity83 and @entity84 , both of which have a 72 - hour waiting period .			1
