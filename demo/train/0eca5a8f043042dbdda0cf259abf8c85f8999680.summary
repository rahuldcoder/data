-- when discussing his favorite images from the " @entity5 of the @entity6 " traveling photography exhibit , @entity2 president @entity1 , who curated the exhibit , starts with the oldest : @entity9 's " mountain of the @entity8			1
" taken in @entity11 on august 24 , 1873 , the photograph would become as legendary as the mountain itself -- not for the effort it took to get the picture , but for what it signified to a country healing from the @entity20 and pushing ever westward			0
hauling hundreds of pounds of photo equipment up to a vantage point on an opposite ridge to capture snow - filled crevasses that created a perfect vertical cross on the mountain face , @entity9 produced an image that , according to @entity1 's introduction in the exhibit 's companion book , came to symbolize " the union of @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 that fulfilled a romantic destiny			1

it 's just one of the thousands @entity1 and his curatorial team of @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 considered from the @entity47 archives when putting together a landmark exhibition that 's currently on display at select museums around the country ( see below )			1
the final cut -- winnowed to 185 images for the show and 75 for the award - winning book -- shows the @entity6 's myriad faces thematically grouped into @entity58 , corralling into categories an epic visual record of almost a century and a half of exploration of the @entity6 with the camera			1
there are cowboys and debutantes , @entity64 spotted owls and bison , cityscapes and pueblos , mesas and dams , gathering storms and controlled burns			0
from early documentary efforts like @entity78 ' celebrated @entity80 portraits to @entity82 's contemporary impressions of modern @entity84 life , from the pristine glories of awe - inspiring landscapes to the gritty exploitation of the region 's resource wealth , @entity1 's opus is both a loving gaze at the magnificence that attracts so many to the @entity6 , and an unblinking eye on the pressing challenges of keeping the romance alive			1
