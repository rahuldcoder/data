-- vampires that sparkle , a human / vampire hybrid baby and something called a @entity3 -- even a fan would admit that " @entity8 " gets complicated toward the end			1
what begins as a pretty standard girl - meets - vampire love story quickly evolves into a girl / vampire / shape - shifter love triangle , one that eventually includes a memorable ( as in , we 're still trying to forget ) at - home birth scene			0
all of that leads up to the final " @entity17 " installment , " @entity18 -- part 2			1
" with the final chapter now in theaters , some of you might be in need of a brief refresher			1
you can always speed - read @entity27 's four novels or spend at least eight hours watching the first four films , but why do that when we 've broken it all down for you here ? let 's start with basics -- what 's a @entity34 ? first , you 're forgiven if you have absolutely zero firsthand knowledge about this character			1
honestly , it 's admirable you 've been able to avoid " twilight " for this long			1
@entity34 ( @entity40 ) is the heart , eyes and voice of " @entity17			0
" at the start of the series she 's a 17 - year - old girl who relocates from @entity46 to @entity47 , @entity48 , to live with her dad when her mom remarries			1
@entity34 is awkward and accident - prone and never really feels in step with everyone else , but these are qualities that make her endearing in the " @entity17 " world			0
she quickly falls for ...			0
the vampire @entity56 @entity56 ( @entity57 ) is a vampire who 's been around for the past century , but he 's also eternally 17			1
he lives with his vampire " family " that 's been cultivated over the years by " @entity61 ( head vampire in charge ) , dr. @entity64 ( @entity65 )			1
they eat animals rather than humans -- their version of vegetarianism -- and being a vampire for them means sparkling " like diamonds " when in sunlight			1
@entity56 can also read minds , with @entity34 's being the exception , and @entity77 ( @entity78 ) , gets visions about the future			1
@entity27 certainly puts her own spin on vampire lore , but @entity56 's still a would - be killer , and he does want to kill @entity34 at first			1
( romance ! ) when @entity34 figures out @entity56 's secret , she remains pretty calm about his vampirism -- even though he admits to thirsting for her blood , which to him basically smells like doughnuts to a dieter			1
life after ' twilight ' : readers pick new teams @entity34 + @entity56 = 4ever @entity56 gets over the " i want to eat you " thing as he gets to know @entity34 and as she 's constantly put into life - threatening situations			1
the ever - present vampires out to kill @entity34 are problematic , considering that these two say they ca n't live without one another			0
they 're each other 's " personal brand [ s ] of heroin , " if you will , and they 're both strung out			1
as best we can tell , this sentiment is established after an impromptu dinner date , some chaste sleepovers and @entity56 saving her from the natural -- an out - of - control car -- and the supernatural -- vampires , including his own brother at @entity34 's 18th birthday party			1
by then , @entity56 ca n't deal with endangering her all the time and he bails			0
@entity34 falls into deep despair , but soon realizes she can conjure visions of @entity56 rescuing her if she puts herself in dangerous situations			0
this leads to a cliff - jumping and near - drowning incident that causes @entity77 to believe that @entity34 's dead , and word works its way back to @entity56			1
share your review of ' @entity126 ' enter the @entity3 the @entity3 , which in the movies includes the lovely @entity128 and esteemed @entity129 , are a group of lethal ( and nattily dressed ) vampires who instill a sense of order in " @entity17 's " vampire universe and shield it from being exposed			1
going against their laws is a great way to get killed			0
since @entity56 ca n't bear living without his soulmate @entity34 , he goes to @entity3 home base in @entity140 on a suicide mission , ready to expose himself as a vampire and attract the @entity3 's wrath			2
@entity34 shows up in time to stop @entity56 , but the @entity3 consider her a risk thanks to her extensive knowledge of the vampires ' ways			0
@entity77 saves her life by revealing a vision that @entity34 will soon become a vampire , a transformation @entity34 's wanted since the first movie , anyway			2
that way she would be with @entity56 for eternity and never age to boot			0
@entity56 , however , is against it -- as is @entity157 , the other guy			2
here 's where the girl / wolf / vampire triangle comes in @entity160 , played by the supremely sculpted @entity161 , is @entity162 and has a gene that causes him to shape - shift into a wolf when vampires are in town			2
his friendship with @entity34 deepened when @entity56 left , and his feelings turn romantic			0
he makes a strong case for @entity34 's affections , and by " @entity173 " has the girl so confused she winds up kissing him			2
to be fair , she was worried about what would happen to him in a standoff between the @entity176 and a new army of vamps created by a vengeful @entity179			0
( she was out for @entity34 's blood ever since @entity56 killed her lover @entity181 in " twilight			2
" ) but even after that , @entity157 still gets second place to @entity56 , whom @entity34 agrees to marry			0
the birth from " twilight " hell @entity34 and @entity56 did n't have sex until after they got married because of @entity56 's old - fashioned ways ( the guy 's been around since 1901 , after all )			2
plus he was worried he 'd crush her to death in the heat of the moment			0
( again , with the romance			0
) the deal was to turn @entity34 into a vampire after she tied the knot , but they hold off a bit so she can experience her wedding night without the distraction of unquenchable bloodthirst			2
after @entity56 swept @entity34 away to a family - owned island for their honeymoon , the sex " @entity17 " fans devoured three books and three movies for finally happens			0
@entity34 's bruised , but satisfied ... and also pregnant			2
through some technicalities that were never covered in our sex education class , @entity34 and @entity56 made a hybrid baby , which means the part - vampire fetus slowly kills her from the inside			2
in what some have read as an anti-abortion plotline , @entity34 insists on keeping her baby against the wishes of loved ones , including @entity56			0
the majority of " @entity18 -- @entity226 " chronicles @entity34 's torturous pregnancy , which demands that she drink a steady diet of blood ...			1
even before she actually becomes a vampire			0
ok , you 're caught up now giving birth to a vampire / human child is a spine - breaking horror show , one so gory that @entity56 had no choice but to turn @entity34 into a vampire to save her			0
but before they can be a happy , mostly vampire family with their new baby @entity236 -- who ages at a much faster rate than a human child -- the threat of the @entity3 rises once again			0
and that 's where we pick things up in " @entity18 -- part 2			1
" the last installment has not only promised us an epic battle and a twist ending , but @entity34 finding out about @entity157 's " imprinting , " when he becomes uncontrollably attached to @entity236 on sight and completely devoted to her for life			0
like we said -- it gets complicated .			1

" @entity8 " gets a bit complicated toward the end
the prior four films have been building up to this *weekend* 's " @entity18 -- part 2 "
*writer* *authors* a " refresher course " for those who need to catch up
