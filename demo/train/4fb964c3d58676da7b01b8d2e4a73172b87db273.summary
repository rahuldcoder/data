@entity0 , @entity1 -- ten minutes ago a woman called me and told me she was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer			2
as i 'm standing in the garage , writing her story onto the huge canvas with the others , the only audible sound was my sharpie scraping against the paper , but her voice never stopped spinning in my mind			1
telling a story is like an invitation for others to share their stories with you			2
that 's what i discovered at @entity23 when i shared my story about a limitation that held me back from my dream			1
after delivering my talk , i found myself constantly being stopped by people eager to share their stories , as hearing mine made them reflect on their own struggles , triumphs , hopes and fears			1
this sharing experience stuck with me , and now two months later , i 'm in the midst of receiving thousands of stories through my current art project			1
i had the idea to crowdsource stories about facing limitations			1
these stories are written onto the canvas , and collectively they create my current art piece			1
what started out as connecting with people through a work of art quickly turned into a documentation of our modern culture			1
if we either rewind or fast forward 1000 years , many of these stories would still be relatable			2
no matter how individualized our stories are , and no matter how much times have changed , we share the same core human experiences in faith , self - identity , health , addiction , love , loss , etc. @entity23 : how i became 100 artists here are two stories that have been shared : " on paper , i have the perfect life			1
i 'm married to a man who loves me more than i deserve , beautiful , healthy children , and a great career			2
but i 'm in love with someone else that i ca n't be with and it impairs me every day			2
" " i was 14 and my mom and i were in a really bad place			2
we had just gone through a messy divorce from an abusive marriage			2
she had also been diagnosed with breast and skin cancer and we were very worried about how we would pay for the medical costs without her job			0
we were standing in line at a pharmacy , we both had pneumonia			0
this really nice elderly women was in line behind us and my mom let her go in front of us and the woman introduced herself , and put her hands over us and started praying , right in the middle of the @entity93			0
my mom got a check from the insurance company a few weeks later			0
a few months after that she was hired at a new job			0
she is currently in her 8th year of breast cancer remission and her 3rd year of skin cancer remission			0
my faith has been renewed and we could not be in a better place			0
my mother is my hero			0
" @entity23 : the painter and the pendulum there are also many stories that encapsulate our society and culture at this very moment -- from the first openly gay couple being able to adopt in @entity111 , to the innumerable amount of people struggling with obesity , to the increasing number of parents raising autistic children			1
what stands out to me the most is that given the opportunity for anonymity in this project , many people are brutally honest about how lonely they truly are in their experiences , thinking no one could possibly know what they 're going through			1
@entity23 : @entity127 's moving sculpture within this wired culture , we 've become edited versions of ourselves			1
we may tweet , " just got a @entity130 , new bottle design			0
sweet ! " but we do n't say , " i 'm sad and alone			0
i had no one to talk to so i went to the store to chat with the clerk while buying a @entity130			0
" i ca n't help but wonder , what 's the cost of becoming our " edited " selves instead of our authentic selves ? we should n't share just gumdrops and butterflies , because the hearty and rocky parts are what help us find our authentic selves			0
this slice of life , our lives , that are being captured in this piece are still ongoing and developing			0
what will continue to come out of it ? i do n't know , but i wait with fascination and a tired writing hand			0
what 's your story ? share it and be part of art at @entity159			1

@entity162 gave a @entity23 describing how a shake led him to different forms of art
in new project , people describe their limitations and he writes them onto a huge canvas
hansen : a project that began with goal of connecting people is also a *portrait* of our cultue
