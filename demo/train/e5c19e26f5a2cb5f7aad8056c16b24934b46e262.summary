the @entity18 senator saw firsthand the intensely hot fire 's wrath : melted cars , burned out skeletons of houses			2
at a news conference later , she said it was hard to put into words how a beautiful neighborhood almost disappeared			1
" many questions must be answered by all of us whose job it is to protect our people , " @entity3 said			1
" what was the cause of this blast of course , first and foremost ? " she asked			2
" were there reports that there were odors escaping from the pipeline ? if there were those reports , what actions took place in response to those complaints ? were emergency systems such as water supply up to the task ? was the gas flow shut down as quickly as possible ? does danger lie in similar pipelines in populated areas ? " lt. gov @entity55 said he has written a letter to the @entity57 , seeking information on gas pipelines across the state , including their age , inspection dates and records			1
new remains were found in the debris left by the large fire , @entity67 , a city spokesman , said on saturday , though he could not immediately confirm whether they were human			2
he had initially told @entity2 two more bodies were found			2
@entity0 police chief @entity70 said five people were still missing			1
residents packed a town hall meeting later saturday , seeking answers from public officials about when they can go home and other rebuilding and compensation issues			2
@entity80 president @entity79 said the company has been scouring phone records and so far , there is no evidence that complaint calls were placed			2
nor was there evidence , he said , that utility crews had been in the area thursday , the day of the blast			2
firefighters were able to fully contain the blaze friday , but federal and state investigators had not yet determined the cause			0
" we are not hear to determine liability or blame , but we are here to determine the cause of the accident , " @entity98 ( @entity98 ) vice chairman @entity97 said			1
@entity97 said the 30 - inch natural gas pipe was installed in 1956			1
" we have seen that piece of pipeline that was blown away , and it is really quite amazing to see this huge piece of pipeline blown the distance it was blown , " he said			0
@entity97 said investigators will look closely at the pipe 's welding and whether the pipe properly emitted an odor that may indicate a gas leak			1
there have been allegations of a smell in the neighborhood at least a week before the blast			1
officials have identified three of the dead			1
rescue workers initially feared the death toll would climb higher as they combed through the smoldering scene with cadaver dogs			0
@entity128 , 44 , and her 13 - year - old daughter @entity129 were killed , @entity127 deputy coroner @entity126 said			0

some residents remained in shelters and watched the harrowing drama unfold on television in a @entity151 or other restaurants at the @entity153			0
@entity154 did not know whether to laugh or cry			0
anger , she told @entity155 , has not yet set in , even though she watched her entire block burn to the ground and her home of seven years vanish into ashes			0
@entity154 was still worrying about some of her neighbors			0
she did n't know whether they were lying in a hospital or whether they had escaped unscathed			0
outside in the parking lot , food and other donated items piled up as @entity0 residents chipped in to help their neighbors			1
one person even left a baby stroller			0
the @entity98 investigation will include analyzing many aspects of the blast and its aftermath , @entity97 said , including the history of the pipeline , the training and performance of its operators , emergency response and injuries sustained			1
employees involved in operating the pipeline have been tested for drugs and alcohol , he said			0
the fire destroyed 37 homes and damaged eight , @entity189 secretary @entity188 said			0
those numbers were considerably lower than the estimate of roughly 170 homes that @entity98 's @entity97 originally said were affected by the blaze			1
companies operating natural gas transmission pipelines reported an average of one death per year from 2004 to 2008 , a february report from the @entity201			2
@entity202 , head of the watchdog group @entity203 , told @entity2 that , unfortunately , when it comes to pipelines , for most of the public it 's " out of sight , out of mind			2
" " i 'm betting in @entity0 most people did n't even know the pipeline was under their neighborhood , " he said			1
@entity202 noted that there can be multiple causes for a pipeline failure , including unintentional excavation - related damage and , more often , age and corrosion			0
