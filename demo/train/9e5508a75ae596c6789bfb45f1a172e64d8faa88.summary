do a similar search in @entity6 and your screen is quickly inundated with piles of scattered hacked bodies , grisly mountains of skulls and long columns of fleeing refugees			0
it 's been 20 years since the devastating violence that left about one million people dead in @entity3 , but global perceptions of the tiny country in east - central @entity20 are often still stuck in 1994			1
images of horror and ruin , as captured by the lenses of foreigners , are still circulating internationally , even though the country has come a long way since those dark days			2
to address this , a new exhibition opens friday in @entity30 , showcasing insightful snapshots of daily life in today 's @entity3 as seen through the eyes of local photographers			1
called " @entity3 in @entity35 : death then , @entity38 , " the show aims to " communicate the complexities of survival after mass violence , " organizers say , while helping international audiences to " understand the scale and scope of the country 's journey			1
" the exhibition features arresting images by more than 10 professional and amateur photographers who back in november took part in an eight - day workshop led by the prominent @entity54 photographer @entity53 and the @entity57 - based @entity56 photojournalist @entity55			2
" we worked with the @entity3 photographers to give them the opportunity to visually tell how they see their country , " explains @entity53 , whose work has been exhibited around the world			1
" it was a platform to allow people to come together to tell their stories , " he adds			0
" often , if you see images coming from @entity3 , the majority has been taken by @entity71 -- this is a chance for them to question the way their country is being interpreted			1
" the final result is a collection of diverse images ranging from intimate portraits to eye - catching landscapes that provide an insight into the complex changes that are currently underway in @entity3 -- snapshots of the rising capital @entity84 , where new buildings pop up and assertive women take a leading role in urban commercial life , are accompanied by scenes of rural life , where poverty and hardship endure			2
the exhibition also features " returnees , " a series of portraits taken by @entity97 capturing @entity3 from all walks of life who 've come back to help in the redevelopment of their country			1
" the people make the country , " says @entity53 , who decided to extend his stay in the landlocked country after the workshop to shoot the " returnees " and also produce a @entity3 version of his popular series of photographs of @entity110 barber shops			2
" it was quite interesting to see young , vibrant people coming to add value to the society , " he says			0
