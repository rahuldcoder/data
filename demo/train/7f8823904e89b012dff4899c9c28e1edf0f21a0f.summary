@entity0 -- military prosecutors have recommended the death penalty for the accused mastermind of the deadly 2000 bombing of the destroyer @entity7			1
the announcement wednesday from the @entity9 is another signal the case against @entity12 will be moving closer to trial before a military commission			1
as one of 16 " high - value " detainees , he has been held for years at the @entity19 's detention facility at @entity20 , @entity21			1
if approved , this would be the first death penalty trial in the reconfigured military trial system			2
intelligence sources have said @entity12 headed @entity26 operations in the @entity27 before his 2002 capture by @entity30 intelligence agents			1
@entity32 director @entity31 confirmed six years later that @entity12 and two other high - value terror suspects were subjected to waterboarding , a harsh interrogation technique			1
the chief prosecutor recommended capital charges against the 46 - year - old @entity39 native			1
he has been formally recharged with planning the bombing attack on the @entity19 vessel , which was in the @entity42 near @entity43			1
two suicide bombers rammed a garbage barge full of explosives into the @entity7 during a refueling stop			1
seventeen sailors were killed , and 47 others were injured			1
the blast left a 40 - by - 40 - foot hole in the port side of the @entity54 , @entity55 - based guided - missile destroyer , which was carrying a crew of 293			0
@entity57 also is charged with heading the aborted attack on the destroyer @entity60 that same year			2
the decision to formally move ahead with the prosecution had been expected for weeks , ever since defense secretary @entity63 in january lifted a previous order that had prevented any new cases from moving forward			0
the final decision about whether the death penalty can be pursued is now in the hands of retired vice adm. @entity69			0
in military terminology he is the convening authority of the military commissions , the equivalent of a civilian criminal court			2
the @entity75 , however , said the " broken military commissions system " should not be used to try @entity12			1
" we are deeply disturbed that the @entity81 administration has chosen to use the military commissions to try a capital case in which much of the evidence is reportedly based on hearsay and therefore not reliable enough to be admissible in federal court , " said @entity77 , director of the @entity75 's @entity78			2
" allowing hearsay is a backdoor way of allowing evidence that may have been obtained through torture			0
" all of our concerns about the inherent unfairness of the military commissions are compounded in cases like this one , in which the result could be death , " @entity91 said			2
" the @entity99 and international law rightly require enhanced protections in death penalty cases , but the military commissions are incapable of providing those necessary protections			0
" @entity43 had separately sentenced the man to death in absentia for his alleged role in the @entity7 attack			2
his four - year custody in secret overseas @entity32 prisons before his 2006 transfer to @entity20 is expected to be a key point of contention in any trial , since @entity12 did not have access to legal counsel for months nor had any charges been filed against him			1
it is unclear what rules of evidence the government could present that would withstand judicial scrutiny			0
military justice rules allow @entity12 to have defense counsel represent him			1
he was charged in december 2008 before a military commission in @entity20 , but the charges were suspended a few months later when the @entity81 administration took over and sought a fresh review of all detainees at the overseas prison			1
later that year attorney general @entity133 announced @entity12 , alleged 9/11 mastermind @entity134 and several other key terror suspects would face prosecution in the military justice system			1
the @entity81 administration had considered transferring some terror suspects to the @entity30 for prosecution in either special military or civilian courts			0
but the president earlier this month announced all prosecutions would be in military courts in @entity20			1
the @entity32 has admitted tapes of @entity12 's interrogation at a secret location in 2002 were destroyed in 2005			2
waterboarding involves strapping a person to a surface , covering his or her face with cloth and pouring water on the face to simulate the sensation of drowning			0
critics have called it torture			0
destruction of @entity32 tapes sparked concerns during his @entity162 -- a preliminary court proceeding -- at @entity20 in march 2007 , @entity12 acknowledged knowing @entity26 leader @entity164 and said he had accepted money from him			1
but @entity164 gave many people money to help them get married or conduct businesses , @entity12 said			2
@entity57 said he is not a member of @entity26 , according to the 4 - year - old documents			0
he said he knew the perpetrators of the bombing because he had business dealings with them in the fishing industry			0
the suspect said he " was tortured into confession , and once he made a confession his captors were happy and they stopped questioning him , " according to a statement read during a 2007 hearing			0
" also , the detainee states that he made up stories during the torture in order to get ( the torture ) to stop			0
" in addition to @entity134 , charges could be forthcoming against @entity189 -- a @entity39 man accused in the failed plot to bomb oil tankers in the @entity193 ; and @entity194 , an @entity195 accused of planting explosives			0
the last military execution was in 1961 , involving a @entity199 private who had been convicted of rape and attempted murder of an @entity204 girl			0
@entity1 @entity206 correspondent @entity205 contributed to this report .			0
