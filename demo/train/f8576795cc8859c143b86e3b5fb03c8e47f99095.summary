-- it 's the most romantic of all settings for a grand slam			1
@entity4 in the spring sees the sweeping boulevards and majestic parks of the @entity8 capital in full and glorious bloom			1
nestled in the chic 16th arrondissement near the @entity12 , @entity10 is much loved by spectators and players alike -- a perfect venue for the second major of the season			0
but for some of the biggest names in tennis , its red clay courts meant only heartbreak and shattered dreams			2
for them it 's the slam that got away			2
the one missing piece of the jigsaw in an otherwise perfect career			0
only seven men in history have achieved the feat of winning all four of the grand slams : @entity34 , and the @entity35 , @entity37 and @entity8 opens			1
@entity38 was the first , back in the 1930s , while in recent years @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 have joined the exclusive club			0
agonizingly short @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , however , were left agonizingly short of the career sweep -- and all three missed out because of their inability to excel on the slower surface at the @entity8			1
until @entity41 broke his record , @entity51 was the all - time leader with 14 grand slam titles , including seven on the grass at @entity34			1
" @entity44 " usually blew away the opposition with his trademark big serve and volley game -- but unfortunately at the @entity58 he had feet of clay and often exited in the early rounds			1
a semifinal appearance in 1996 was the closest he came to lifting the title , being beaten in straight sets by the eventual winner @entity64 of @entity65			0
looking back on his career , the 41 - year - old @entity35 still has a nagging regret that he could not adapt his formidable talents to clay court play			1
" i could have worked a little harder , " he told @entity0 's @entity72			0
" i mean i worked hard but you always look back at your career and feel i should have done			0
" @entity51 legendary tennis journalist and broadcaster @entity76 told @entity0 that the match against @entity64 summed up @entity51 ' problems on clay			0
" he was playing really well against him then reverted to his old serve and volley type and his chance was gone			0
" he was stubborn about it			0
he was going to be @entity44 and it did n't work out			1
" of the three , it was @entity46 who came closest to adding the @entity88 to his impressive haul			1
" i think we all tried to win the @entity58 and we all tried to prepare the best way we could , " the 47 - year - old told @entity0			1
in the 1989 final he faced a 17 - year - old @entity94 and was heavy favorite , despite the @entity35 teenager 's incredible heroics en route to the title match			1
@entity46 led by two sets to one and looked set to end @entity94 's fairytale , but could not finish it off			2
" it was a match that maybe i should have won , i was in the lead but somehow he got out of the grip and he won in five sets , " he recalls			0
@entity46 denied @entity94 became the youngest grand slam winner in history , but @entity46 did not begrudge him his moment of triumph -- the @entity112 believed he would have other opportunities to win in @entity4			1
" at the time i thought i played a great tournament and i thought i would get another chance to win it , but i never really got another chance after that , " he added with some regret			0
@entity76 believes the six - time grand slam winner was just unfortunate to have run into an inspired opponent			1
" @entity46 had a good shot , but it was just @entity94 's tournament			2
" @entity46 enjoyed his greatest triumphs at @entity34 -- where he was twice champion and once a losing finalist -- and maybe a clue to his @entity58 failures lay in his underlying attitude to the clay - court grand slam			1
" i knew that i was n't going to get my best results on the clay , but at the same time i saw it as a preparation for @entity34 as well , " he said			2
" the more matches i could play on the clay and get ready physically , you know the easier it was on the grass			0
" in that respect he was similar to @entity45 , with whom he enjoyed a titanic rivalry at @entity34 , meeting in three straight finals			1
@entity45 's disappointment but @entity45 's style of play was even more unsuited to clay - court perfection , which requires patience and skill and long baseline rallies			2
nicknamed " @entity45 " because of his massive service and crunching ground strokes , he just could not adapt -- despite having grown up playing on clay courts			2
" @entity155 was difficult because it was against my personality , " he admitted			0
" on clay you win by making less mistakes , on any other surface you win by making more winners			0
" i am not a guy that waits for the opponent to miss. so psychologically it was always difficult for me to play on clay			0
" but despite his perceived disadvantages , it was not for want of trying to claim his place in tennis history			0
" trust me , i tried everything to win			0
" i reached finals , semifinals of big clay - court tournaments and the semifinals of the @entity8 three times but i was n't good enough , " he told @entity0			2
those three appearances in 1987 , 1989 -- losing in five to @entity46 -- and 1991 all ended in disappointment			2
" i lost to @entity180 , who was better than me on clay , i lost to an @entity40 who was better than me , " he admitted			0
" it was just about the quality of play , and my quality of play was n't good enough to win a major on clay			0
" never suited @entity45 also won six grand slams in total -- three at @entity34 , two in @entity37 and the @entity190 on his only final appearance -- plus four end - of - season @entity193 world championship crowns			1
despite his @entity58 misses , the @entity195 superstar refuses to be downbeat about his efforts on the red dirt			2
" i ca n't complain , " he said			0
" @entity180 , @entity40 and @entity199 were better			0
" @entity45 was just @entity45 , going to the net , diving around everywhere			2
i think he felt he was going to make it , but never did			0
" @entity46 , who was also brought up on clay courts in his formative years and swept all the grand slam titles for junior players in 1983 , was in @entity76 ' opinion the best suited of the three to sample success in @entity4			1
but his serve and volley tactics could only work to a point as baseliners adapted to his style of play , particularly in the latter stages of the tournament			0
" some players hated playing against me on the clay , but the difficult thing with winning on clay was playing well for two weeks , " @entity46 said			2
" you know i could win the tournament for one week , but i think playing serve and volley for two weeks , that was the tough part of it to play really well for two weeks on the clay and that 's what you need at the @entity58			1
" @entity229 regret other tennis legends have also come between a rock and a hard place on the unforgiving clay -- none more so than @entity235 , who has often expressed his regret at not adding the @entity58 title to his seven other slams			1
in 1984 he was on a 43 - game winning streak and having reached the final was slicing and dicing @entity199 in clinical style in the @entity8 title match			2
two sets up in under an hour , a disputed line call disrupted his concentration and @entity199 eventually wrapped up a five - set win			0
@entity235 's @entity35 arch rival @entity247 was also stuck one short of the grand slam sweep by virtue of failing to win the @entity58			1
and @entity251 , who famously upset @entity247 to win the 1975 @entity34 crown , was another to fall short on a surface he found difficult			1
it seems some greats are destined never to taste the warm glow of success in @entity4 and current world @entity259 just needs a @entity8 title to complete his career grand slam			1
@entity259 's goal " @entity42 " @entity42 denied him in last year 's final and also prevented the @entity264 taking his place in the record books this year with a five - set victory in friday 's semifinals			0
@entity41 claimed his sole @entity8 crown in 2009 after @entity42 lost his only match in eight years in @entity4 in the fourth round to @entity273 , and the @entity275 maestro will be grateful he seized his opportunity to complete his grand slam set			1
@entity76 , now 83 , believes @entity37 great @entity278 is the greatest player he has seen on clay at the @entity58			1
" i 'm a guy who goes overboard for @entity278 but realize ( @entity282 ) @entity281 and @entity42 would be tough to beat			0
" @entity278 , however , is also in the group of legends who ended stuck one short of a career grand slam			1
in his case he never won @entity34 , despite reaching the final four times -- the last as a 39 - year - old veteran , but losing to @entity247 in 1974 .			1

grand slam in tennis consists of @entity34 , @entity8 , @entity35 and @entity37 opens
only seven men have completed a career grand slam in singles
@entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 all won three of the slams
each missed out on the career grand slam by failing to win @entity58
