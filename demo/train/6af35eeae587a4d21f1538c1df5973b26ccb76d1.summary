" you 'll never look at sand and water the same way again			2
( keep reminding yourself — it is just sand and water			2
) on @entity18 of a contest , a solo sculptor or " carver " is presented with a 10 - ton pyramid of sand ( two - person teams in doubles competition work with 20 to 25 tons )			1
then , through a rigorous process of shoveling , packing , stacking and carving , a sculpture takes shape			2
spectators can watch it all -- from the first day " pound up " in which the sand is compressed , to the hours of carving with manual tools such as trowels , butter knives , tablespoons and drinking straws , plus some that the sculptors devise for themselves			2
( @entity40 sculptor @entity39 's patented @entity41 -- inspired by the base of a wine glass -- makes perfect sand spheres			2
) " the first question anyone asks us is what happens when it rains , but wind and sun are worse than rain when you 're sculpting sand , " says @entity45 , who with @entity46 is co-owner of @entity47 and co-hosted the @entity49 series " @entity50			2
" " we wet down the sculptures as we work			2
the surface tension of the water holds the sand together			2
" finished sculptures may be sprayed with a solution of water and school glue to preserve them for long - term viewing			2
nevertheless , many sand sculpture events are held under tents or temporary shelters safe from the elements , and quite a few take place off the beach in parks and open spaces where sand is brought in especially for the event			1
@entity82 's best little beach towns " the sand is always different , " @entity45 notes			2
" @entity84 dug out of the ground has sharp edges that lock together			0
beach sand is rounded because it 's been washed by the waves			0
you have to listen to the sand			0
it tells you what to build			0
sand sculpture is a brilliant mix between engineering and artwork			1
