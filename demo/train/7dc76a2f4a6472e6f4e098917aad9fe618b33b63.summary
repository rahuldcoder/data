-- @entity1 is reporting that @entity2 will cease development of its family of @entity6 - branded music players due to weak demand and a desire to focus on its smartphone platform			1
@entity6 will live on as a software and services platform , according to @entity1 's source			0
@entity12 embeds the @entity6 player for media playback on the phone , uses the @entity16 for online music sales , and the @entity6 pc software for media syncing and firmware updates			0
these uses will be unhindered by the cancellation of the standalone @entity6 hardware			0
