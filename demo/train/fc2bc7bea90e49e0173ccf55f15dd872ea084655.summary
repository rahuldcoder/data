-- a group of @entity3 clinics that provide abortions are asking the @entity6 @entity5 for emergency action to keep their facilities open , in the face of state restrictions that went into effect last week			1
a ruling by a federal appeals court earlier this month gave @entity3 the green light to move forward on the mandate requiring all abortion clinics in the state be " ambulatory surgical centers , " regulated under the same standards as hospitals			1
another challenged provision would force doctors performing abortions to first obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital			2
abortion rights groups said 13 reproductive health clinics were forced to immediately close friday after the court ruling , leaving only a handful still operating			1
the time - sensitive appeal was filed with justice @entity30 , who gave @entity3 officials until thursday to respond in writing			0
@entity30 would then presumably ask his other eight colleagues to weigh in before issuing an order on behalf of the court			0
any order would only have temporary effect , until more appeals can be filed on the larger questions of the @entity3 law 's constitutionality			0
that process may take several months , at least , to resolve			0
the @entity5 refused to intervene previously when other sections of the @entity3 law were challenged in court			1
lawmakers in the state 's @entity48 - majority @entity47 have said the regulations would improve patient care and safety			1
abortion rights groups counter , saying the law is designed to make it nearly impossible to operate an abortion clinic in @entity3			1
the @entity56 had sued @entity3 this past spring , on behalf of a coalition of abortion clinics			1
in august , a federal judge ruled that the " ambulatory surgical centers " requirement was unconstitutional and imposed an injunction			0
thursday 's appeals court ruling lifted that injunction and allowed the measure to go into effect immediately			0
@entity67 , spokeswoman for the state attorney general 's office , said in a statement after that ruling , " this decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the @entity47 to craft a law to protect the health and safety of @entity3 women			2
" abortion rights groups counter the mandate will leave women of reproductive age in the state with minimal health care options , and called the appeals court decision " demonstrably wrong			1
" " over 900,000 @entity3 women of reproductive age , more than a sixth of all such women in @entity3 , now reside more than 150 miles from the nearest @entity3 abortion provider , up from 86,000 prior to the enactment of the challenged act , " said the clinics in their emergency application to the high court			2
" women 's ability to exercise their constitutional right to obtain an abortion will be lost , and their lives will be permanently and profoundly altered , " by having those clinics remaining closed			2
supporters said before the bill was enacted , there were 41 facilities in @entity3 providing abortions			0
@entity104 2 also bans abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy and tightens usage guidelines for " abortion - inducing drugs " such as @entity108			2
critics contend the law , in addition to eliminating abortion across huge swaths of the state , will further deny access to many women in rural communities and will force women to seek dangerous " back - alley " abortions			1
@entity121 gov. @entity121 signed the bill into law last year			0
the high court case is @entity125 v. @entity126 ( @entity127 )			0
@entity0 's @entity128 contributed to this report .			0

abortion clinics ask @entity5 to intervene
ruling last week was on section of law requiring clinics to *adhere* to hospital - level standards
*legislators* have said this would improve patient care and safety
abortion rights groups decry ruling , say it cuts off access
