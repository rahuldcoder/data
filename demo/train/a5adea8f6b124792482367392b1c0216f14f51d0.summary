-- whether or not @entity2 's @entity1 will be the world 's tallest building upon completion is subject to debate ( last week , it was announced @entity7 just might thwart the @entity1 's ambitions )			1
even if it only ties for the honor , there 's no doubt that the 3,280 - feet ( 1,000 meters ) tall structure will be a luxury experience			2
as it turns out , even the elevators will be @entity17			2
not only will the elevators reach a record height of 2,165 feet ( 660 meters ) , but the elevators responsible for shuttling visitors directly to the tower 's observation deck will be the world 's fastest double - decker lifts -- traveling at speeds of 30 feet ( 10 meters ) per second			1
according to @entity28 , head of technology for major projects at @entity31 -- the company contracted to build the structure 's elevators -- high - rolling residents will also be able to communicate directly with the lifts through their phones			1
" you can call the elevator as you step out of your car so you have it practically there when you arrive , " he says			2
@entity31 , who are leaders in elevator technology , will also be doing away with what for decades has been one of the most defining elevator features : buttons			1
" instead , we will have keypads outside the elevators , where people can type in their destination , " says @entity28			2
the advantage , he says , is that people traveling to the same destination can be grouped together in one elevator			0
it 's a system that not only speeds up the journey by enabling each elevator to make fewer stops , but is more energy efficient as well			0
even crafting an elevator that can reach heights above 1,600 feet ( 500 meters ) is a technological marvel			1
the reason is that steel cables , which have long been the traditional means of pulling up an elevator , are heavy			0
the taller the building , the more cables are needed to lift it			0
in order to travel the distance to the observation deck , a single elevator in the @entity1 would require nearly 20 tons of steel rope			1
getting that much weight to where it needs to be for installation is near impossible			0
new technology , in the form of the @entity81 , has made it newly possible for an elevator to reach great heights			1
made from carbon fiber , the new rope is both lighter and stronger than its steel predecessors			0
by comparison , a single lift would only require around three tons of the new cable to operate			0
the savings in weight , says @entity28 , equals a further reduction in energy consumption			0
" because of the rope , these elevators will reduce typical energy consumption by as much as 21 % , " he says			0
first dinosaur bones in @entity2 discovered inside the world 's largest mall when the elevators do n't work in the world 's tallest building			1

vips visiting the building will be able to call an elevator using their cell phones
the elevators at the @entity1 will not have buttons inside
new cable technology makes it possible for an elevator to reach a height above 1,600 feet
