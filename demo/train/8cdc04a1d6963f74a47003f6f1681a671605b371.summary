-- rather than getting the relaxing vacation they paid for , more than 3,000 passengers on @entity2 have endured five days stranded in the @entity4 , smelling backed - up toilets and watching sewage slosh on deck			1
" a floating petri dish " is how one passenger , a doctor , put it			2
as tugboats bring the ship to @entity15 , @entity16 , on thursday , many on board might be considering what to do next			2
could @entity2 passengers sue the cruise line ? they could , @entity0 legal analyst @entity20 said , but whether the claim has merit will depend on the paperwork they signed when they purchased their ticket			1
negligent infliction of emotional distress would be the main justification for a suit , said @entity31 , an experienced maritime lawyer based in @entity32			1
tensions are high on board			0
there was the stress inflicted by the fire in the engine room , which began the mess , a scary experience for sure			0
apart from the uncomfortable situation with bad smells , there is a risk of health problems because of poor sanitation			0
and passengers have reported minor fights			1
all of this is justification for going to court , @entity31 said			0
but it is n't that simple			1
five things we 've learned about cruising what can make suing a cruise line complicated ? carnival has a prohibition on class - action suits in its tickets , information that would n't be obvious to passengers who did n't read the fine print when they bought tickets			1
@entity67 courts have said that ship owners and operators can not put that language on tickets			0
but carnival , though headquartered in @entity32 , is incorporated outside the @entity67 , partly in @entity73 and @entity74 , experts say			1
@entity2 is a @entity76 - flagged vessel , so the @entity77 is the primary investigative agency			1
why did the rescue take five days ? what else is detailed on the ticket ? @entity2 's ticket contract says the cruise line is not " liable to the passenger for damages for emotional distress , mental suffering / anguish or psychological injury of any kind under any circumstances , except when such damages were caused by the negligence of @entity2 and resulted from the same passenger sustaining actual physical injury , or having been at risk of actual physical injury			1
" while no physical injuries have been reported , if a passenger contracted a significant disease such as hepatitis from unsanitary conditions aboard on the ship , maritime trial attorney @entity97 believes , physical injury could be argued			0
" i think that a case can be made that everyone on that ship is at risk of actual physical injury , " he said			0
opinion : what cruise lines do n't want you to know what else should a passenger consider ? would it take a long time to see a resolution after filing suit ? it would be incredibly expensive for a lone plaintiff to sue			1
and no matter how a suit is brought , it would probably take two years for it to wind through court , @entity31 said			2
but it could still be done			0
consider the case of @entity123 , the cruise liner that ran aground off @entity125 in january 2011			0
thirty - two people were killed			0
many people from different countries sued the owners of the @entity123 with varying results			0
in at least one example , the cruise liner reportedly offered to pay 11,000 euros to each of 235 @entity135 nationals affected			0
is there another remedy ? could passengers be compensated by their travel insurance ? @entity141 of travel site @entity140 said that 's unlikely			2
" @entity144 really does n't cover this sort of thing			2
their trip was n't interrupted , and they are n't incurring extra expenses ... so they ca n't be compensated that way , " he said			2
opinion : how @entity2 can clean up the pr mess what does a passenger have to weigh before moving forward ? " in the real world , a big company like @entity2 is going to want to try to make these passengers as happy as possible as quickly as possible , " @entity20 said			1
the cruise line said it would give each passenger $ 500 , a free flight home and a full refund for the trip and for most expenses on board , as well as a credit for another cruise			0
" do these people want to take what @entity2 is offering and get on with their lives , " @entity20 asked , " or do they want to get into a long legal struggle that may not yield the results they want ? " my celebration trip on the @entity2 : from joy to misery @entity0 's @entity180 contributed to this report .			1

passengers could sue carnival , lawyers say
but filing a suit is n't easy
more than 3,000 passengers on @entity2 have been stranded for five days
