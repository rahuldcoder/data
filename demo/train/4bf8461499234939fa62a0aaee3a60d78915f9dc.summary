the @entity2 debate between @entity3 and @entity4 -- it 's an obvious choice for me			1
@entity9 called the next day to say that @entity2 never would have passed without that show			1
so all things considered , i chose this for its impact and importance -- it had the largest viewership in cable history at the time			2
so that 's why it 's my number one			1
@entity23 -- he is , in my opinion , the foremost entertainer of the 20th century			1
and one of the hardest gets to get			2
and it was his last interview as well as a great conversation			2
@entity29 -- @entity30 , like @entity23 , was impossible to get			1
i think @entity29 was the foremost actor of his time			1
and as with @entity23 , it was just an incredible interview			1
plus , i got a kiss out of it ! 4			0
@entity37 -- such an important show			2
having three leaders -- of @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 -- on at the same time had worldwide relevance			0
@entity45 chairman @entity44 , @entity46 of @entity40 and @entity41 prime minister @entity47			0
it was worldwide diplomacy happening right there			0
how can you top that ? 5			0
@entity53 -- it was the worst thing to ever happen to the @entity55 in modern history			0
just getting to go there two weeks later , to walk among the rubble , to interview firemen and policemen , the first responders , to go to the burn center at the hospital , to see what happened up close -- it was living history			0
it is something i 'll never forget .			0
