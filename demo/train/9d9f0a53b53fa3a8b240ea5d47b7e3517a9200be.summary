some days start out historic			1
the gay civil rights movement has reached the @entity1 -- a milestone by any measure			1
we wo n't know what the justices will decide until june , but it is not too early to reflect on how we got here			0
the sea change in public opinion on gay rights in general and same - sex marriage in particular has been unprecedented			1
a decade ago , just 27 % of @entity12 backed same - sex marriage ; today it is a clear majority			1
in recent weeks , politicians like @entity15 and republicans @entity16 and @entity17 have declared their support for marriage equality			2
and while far more elected @entity21 than @entity22 support same - sex marriage , polls show that this is increasingly more of a generational divide than a partisan divide			1
in fact , a majority of @entity22 under age 50 now support the freedom to marry -- including more than 60 % of evangelicals under 30			2
how did this happen ? first , give the activists their due			0
thought leaders like @entity35 and @entity36 deserve a lot of credit for taking early stands in favor of the freedom to marry			0
former @entity43 mayor @entity42 also brought recognition to the issue by officiating over same - sex marriage ceremonies at @entity47			1
@entity49 poll : " @entity17 effect " fuels support for same - sex marriage the movement to encourage gays and lesbians to publicly come out has also broken down barriers , forcing friends and family members to confront reality , leading to greater compassion and recognition of the moral imperative of civil rights , rooted in the golden rule : treat others as you would like to be treated			1
but the mainstreaming of marriage equality reflects a strategic shift as well as a cultural shift			2
instead of activists bringing attention to the cause with street theater tactics that often alienate more people than they attract , there has been a relatively recent move to build bridges beyond the base			0
this means outreach to republicans as well as making counter-intuitively conservative arguments for same - sex marriage			1
embodying this strategic shift is @entity85 , the former @entity86 administration solicitor general who teamed up with @entity87 , his opponent in the @entity86 v @entity88 case , to argue that @entity92 's @entity91 banning same - sex marriage was unconstitutional			1
i interviewed them in 2010 and their comments reflected many of the arguments @entity98 made at the @entity1 on tuesday			0
" we as conservatives should support the right of decent taxpaying citizens and individuals who want a stable relationship that forms a building block of our neighborhoods and our economy and our society , " @entity98 said			0
" these are people that want to participate in life as citizens the way the rest of us do			0
we should be supportive as conservatives and as liberals			0
it 's not exclusive to either party or either part of the political spectrum			0
" " this is not and should not be viewed as a conservative or liberal or @entity22 or @entity21 issue , " @entity87 added			0
" this is a civil - rights issue and a human - rights issue			1
" opinion : will gay rights infringe on religious liberty ? this is an essentially centrist strategy : define the common ground that exists on any given issue and then build on it , proceeding from broad principle rather than partisan politics and positional bargaining			1
@entity98 and @entity87 , a @entity22 and a @entity135 , are proud members of their parties			0
but their powerful partnership represents an understanding of the vital center as a dynamic way of solving problems , creating new coalitions that can help overturn decades of stubborn stereotypes about the split - the - difference impulse of the " mushy middle			2
" look at the ads that have been run in favor of marriage equality , especially this effort by the @entity153 for marriage coalition ( which , full disclosure , my wife and fellow @entity49 contributor , @entity159 , participated in ) that included public testimonies in favor of marriage equality by @entity163 , @entity164 and president @entity165 , highlighting unexpected common ground			2
notice the images of apple pie @entity168 that begin the ad , making the visual case that marriage is an essentially conservative institution that leads to societal stability and reduced dependence on the government			2
likewise , look at the 131 republicans who signed on to the amicus brief in support of the freedom to marry , including prominent members of the @entity86 administration and the @entity185 campaign , both of which had pledged to pursue a federal marriage amendment			2
it is a heartening sign of centrists and libertarians breaking the social conservative stranglehold on the @entity22			0
it is a reminder that the essence of evangelism is winning converts			0
to some ears , " gay marriage " is more polarizing than " freedom to marry " ( the preferred term for conservatives ) and " marriage equality " ( a phraseology that unites liberals )			1
the emphasis on individual freedom and civil rights helps humanize the issue			2
opinion : the real ' modern family ' in @entity12 all this is a form of triangulation : trying to achieve progress on policy by depolarizing an issue , creating new coalitions			1
and it is built on a sturdy foundation because it reminds us of deeper truths , namely that there is more that unites us than divides us as @entity12			1
perhaps not coincidentally , it also is the type of argument that might sway swing votes on the @entity1 -- as well as swing voters -- to support this extension of individual civil rights			0
the shift in public opinion overturns centuries of established thought about marriage influenced by culture and religion			0
the fact that it has been comparatively rapid is a reflection of the durability and flexibility of our democracy			0
we can adapt as part of our never - ending effort to form a more perfect union			0
whatever the @entity1 ultimately decides about the constitutionality of @entity91 and the @entity249 , the movement of same - sex marriage from the margins to the mainstream has been achieved			1
opinion : @entity92 wants a do - over on same - sex marriage vote the centrist model by which it moved forward can be replicated as we try to call a ceasefire in the culture wars and actually start to solve problems through the process of addition rather than division .			1

@entity266 says the *success* of the gay rights movement is historic
@entity266 : whatever court decides , same - sex marriage has been endorsed by majority in @entity12
supporters of gay rights *skillfully* positioned the movement as *bipartisan* and centrist , he says
@entity266 : progress on gay rights is a model for reaching *consensus* on other issues
