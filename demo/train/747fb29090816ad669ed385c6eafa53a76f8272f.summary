@entity1 , @entity0 -- schools worldwide book him to put a stop to bullying			1
one @entity0 community promised him $ 20,000 to get him to come to town for two weeks last fall			0
he calls himself the @entity9 , and his price tag can run as much as $ 6,500 a day			1
the @entity9 is his legal name -- we checked			1
it 's safe to say his presentation is unlike anything most students have ever seen			2
the kids love him , and many school officials sing his praises			1
but @entity2 learned not every past customer believes he offers a real solution to the difficult problem of bullying in @entity26 's schools			1
beyond the strange name and the four - figure daily rate , what 's most eye - opening is how this in - demand bully prevention guru defies the squeaky clean image expected of educators			0
he 's no mr. @entity35 leading sweet sing - alongs in a sweater vest and tie -- far from it			0
he 's a tough - talking former tattoo artist covered in ink			1
lacking formal academic credentials , the @entity9 acknowledges his looks and his lesson plans are a bit unconventional			1
scary , as he likes to be called , delivers a shock - and - awe approach			2
speaking before a packed auditorium of schoolchildren in @entity1 , @entity0 , he barfs up apples , groans and rubs his ink - stained belly and intentionally pokes fun at the shortest middle - schooler , the bald pe teacher and the " geek in the wheelchair			0
" he explains he 's demonstrating classic bullying behavior to make kids aware of the problem			1
the entertaining antics are followed up with fist - pumping and a steely look as he delivers his takeaway : " you travel around on this world , and you put out hate and anger , and you cop an attitude , you 'll draw all this into your life wherever you go			0
" @entity9 calls his performances " edu - tainment " -- a way to grab the kids ' attention with humor and throw in a positive lesson at the same time			1
playing the bully , he says , is how he role plays his young adult years when he would find fault with just about everyone			0
when pressed for his strongest message about bullying , he says it 's to " show [ kids ] they have the power to make the choice to be who they want to be and not become what they see and hear around them			1
" kids seem to hang on to his every word , and schools and communities are buying into his act			1
over the past 13 years , @entity9 says he has visited schools in 19 states , and he gets requests by countries worldwide			1
he 's even been booked by law enforcement and the @entity26 military			0
some school administrators we talked to , however , wonder whether visiting outsiders like @entity9 are more than just " clanging bells , " as one @entity0 principal put it , rather than the culture change desperately needed in @entity26 's schools			1
" you can have these kinds of folks come in and they are , in a sense , a bit of a mercenary -- a one - time , one - shot deal , " says principal @entity109 of @entity110 , @entity0			0
" does that really change kids ' lives ? and my answer is no. " @entity9 visited @entity109 's middle school last year			1
the cost was covered by a federal grant			0
parts of @entity9 's performance were positive , @entity109 says , but other parts were inappropriate enough to convince @entity109 he would never invite @entity129 back			1
@entity109 recounts how scary , in an attempt to show that hand - shaking and hugging is harmless , reached out to shake a student 's hand and sarcastically said , " oh , that 's the best sex i 've had all day ! " to a room full of middle - schoolers			1
after the crude comment , @entity109 says , he immediately knew his phone would light up			0
" well , what got left with the kids ? " he says , " the kids got , ' oh , that 's the best sex i 've had all day , ' not that it 's ok to shake someone 's hand or to hug them			2
" @entity9 says he was just role playing , and that most people find it funny			2
in his interview with @entity2 , @entity9 also did n't seem overly concerned about discrepancies in some of his business and professional claims			2
his invoice to schools and his website -- before we sat down for an interview -- claimed his charity , @entity160 , is a nonprofit			2
( he changed his website after our interview			0
) the truth is @entity160 lost tax - exempt status nearly two years ago			0
" it probably fell out because i did n't report all of my taxes for the last seven years , " admits @entity9			2
@entity2 also learned his for - profit business , @entity168 , was dissolved in the @entity26 so his earnings from past gigs have been going to his bank account tax - free			0
he says he 's trying to work out his taxes and is restructuring his business now , but his life on the road has made it difficult			0
and , he says , schools do n't care whether he 's for - profit or a charity			2
middle school @entity180 of @entity1 , @entity0 , the community that booked @entity9 for two weeks last fall , is still a true believer			1
" i think his credentials are stellar			0
and we looked into them because this is risky , " @entity180 says , when " you bring someone in that looks like @entity9 , that talks like @entity9			2
" @entity180 , who together with a parent - initiated bullying committee booked @entity9 to come to austin - area schools , says a messenger with shock value is exactly what the community needed to wake up and take action against bullying			1
" i just love his approach , " says @entity180			0
" it 's not perfect			0
some would say not beautiful			0
maybe shocking to look at , but it gets everyone 's attention			0
" the fact that @entity9 never finished college and has no formal training does n't bother @entity180			1
" in our world , the academic world , you have to have a degree , the law says you have to have a degree from an academic institution in order to do the job , " @entity180 said , " but that does n't make you a good teacher			2
" scary is also quick to defend his self - styled teaching methods and shared with @entity2 a curriculum he 's developing to go along with it			0
" my teaching is researched - based in my personal experience and how i read people			0
no , it 's not out of a book , " @entity9 says , " but the truth is i do n't know where anyone would go to teach what i 've been doing			2
" and @entity9 says he has letters to prove he 's making a difference in kids ' lives			1
" [ the letters ] just tell me what it 's like to make a difference , to make a change -- to wake up to the idea that they do n't have to live with stress and negative behavior around them , " said @entity9			1
@entity109 recognizes some communities benefit from a scary visit because his controversial approach can start a much - needed conversation about bullying ; however , he says , what really matters is the daily interactions adults have with kids from the bus drivers to the school counselors			1
as he points out , people like @entity9 come and go			2
" it is an ongoing process and the adults in this building , the adults in this community , the connections we make with kids -- that 's what creates the culture , the anti-bullying culture that you 're trying to provide , " says @entity109			0
" i think a lot of people are just asking for somebody else to do what we need to do ourselves			0

the scary @entity9 has an unusual presentation to stop bullying in schools
scary is a former tattoo artist with no academic training
not every school has been *enamored* of his show
he says the letters kids send him *reinforce* the idea he is making a difference
