@entity0 -- a nurse who administered propofol to @entity4 more than a dozen times said the pop star did not appear to be a drug - seeker			1
@entity8 was called as a witness thursday by @entity10 in an effort to convince jurors that @entity4 was so deceptive and secretive about his drug use that its executives had no way of knowing his health was in danger as he prepared for his comeback concerts			1
an economist hired by the concert promoter 's lawyers will testify friday in an effort to downplay how much money @entity4 might have earned had he not died at age 50 -- an important issue if the jury decides @entity10 is liable in his death			1
@entity4 's mother and three children contend the company negligently hired , retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death -- which the coroner ruled was caused by an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol			2
@entity10 argues that @entity4 chose and controlled dr. @entity37 , who told investigators he gave @entity4 nightly infusions of propofol to treat his insomnia			1
@entity8 , a certified nurse anesthetist , testified about an incident on june 3 , 2003 in which @entity4 stopped breathing while under sedation for a procedure with @entity46 dermatologist dr. @entity45			1
after @entity4 suffered a " somewhat bizarre reaction " during the sedation , @entity45 told @entity8 it might be because the singer had an " opioid antagonist " implant			2
it was intended to help treat a dependence on @entity54 , he said			0
" you expect your clients and doctors be honest with you and i felt ambushed and was upset , " @entity8 testified			0
the nurse said it made him angry at both @entity45 and @entity4			0
@entity10 lawyers hope jurors see the incident as evidence that @entity4 was dishonest about his drug use , which would support their contention that their executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments he was getting from @entity37			0
@entity8 also testified that @entity4 failed to follow his instructions in two instances after being sedated for procedures			1
@entity4 went to a @entity76 restaurant for a bucket of chicken instead of going home and eating crackers , he testified			0
another time he went to a rehearsal for a @entity83 show performance and sprained his ankle , he said			0
every instance where @entity4 was given propofol was medically justified , @entity8 said			2
the 14 times he administered it between 2000 and 2003 involved plastic surgeries , dermatological procedures and oral surgeries , he said			1
he first sedated @entity4 in 1993 when he was being treated for serious scalp burns suffered while filming a @entity93 commercial several years earlier , he said			0
some of the 25 times he was hired to assist with @entity4 's procedures no drugs were given , he said			1
he would just hold his hand and assure him it would be all right			0
@entity4 never asked for specific drugs and never quarreled with him , he said			1
all of the doctors who treated him were respected physicians , he said			0
@entity8 's friendly relationship with @entity4 ended in november 2003 when he canceled a procedure because @entity4 was " a little goofy , a little slow to respond			2
" @entity8 said he refused to sedate @entity4 because he suspected he was lying to him about his use of drugs			2
" despite 10 years of good quality care and taking good care of him for a long period of time , he never called me , " he said			0
@entity10 's lead lawyer has said he would call as witnesses " many , many , doctors " who have treated @entity4 to make their case that he was a secretive drug addict			1
the trial in a @entity0 court concludes its 13th week friday and is expected to last into september .			0
