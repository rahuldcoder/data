-- @entity1 says it has more than 100 million active users -- a pretty impressive chunk of the online population who are , if nothing else , checking in to see what other people are sharing			1
with that many folks on the six - year - old microblogging site , @entity1 is always good for a few surprises			1
sure , you already know about such famous tweeters as @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			2
but did you expect funnyman @entity17 to create a photo series of his foot in interesting places ? and , sure , @entity22 political strategist @entity21 uses the site to share talking points and links			2
but who would have expected him to post a candid picture of president @entity28 with " @entity29 , then turn it into a not - so - subtle jab at @entity33 front - runner @entity32 ? and then , there are the @entity35 who surprise you by being there in the first place			2
whether because of their age , image or interests , some people just do n't seem like likely fans of @entity1 's 140 - character bursts of wit and wisdom ( or ... you know ... other stuff )			1
and yet there they are , tweeting to thousands , if not millions , of followers			0
here are 10 well - known people whose @entity1 accounts caused us to do a double - take			1
let us know in the comments if you think we missed somebody good			0
@entity59 first , he 's 80 years old			1
second , he was fresh off of a brutal few months , during which the flagship paper of his media empire folded in shame after a phone - tapping scandal			2
but that did n't stop the media - empire tycoon from leaping with both feet into the @entity1 pool last month			1
there have been a few gaffes ( chatting with a fake @entity72 co-founder @entity71 , and not seeming to realize that an account set up in his own wife 's name was not real ) but @entity59 is active on the site and appears in for the long haul			1
sample tweet : @ rupertmurdoch @entity80 a brilliant achievement , but $ 75 - 100bn ? would make @entity82 look really cheap			2
@entity83 if you 're the creator of the world 's biggest social networking site , it might be surprising that you 'd pop up on another			1
( it 's worth noting that @entity83 also has an account on upstart @entity92 and , for a while , was its most - followed member )			1
that said , @entity83 ca n't exactly be accused of lighting his @entity1 feed afire			1
he had n't tweeted since 2009 before january , when he posted a message opposing the now - shelved @entity99			0
so , if you follow him , be patient			0
sample tweet : @ finkd tell your congressmen you want them to be pro-internet			0
my @entity80 post is here ...			0
@entity106 ok , maybe it 's just because this one feels like such a time warp			1
he was born in 1926 and broke into the comedy business in the 1950s			0
but , by all appearances , that 's really " @entity106 " on @entity1 ( witness the photo he posted with his dog @entity116 who , he explains , writes all of his tweets )			1
he tweets at a clip of about once a day and , as you might expect , they 're just about all zingers			0
and by the way , you may ask ... whom does @entity106 follow on @entity1 ? nobody , hockey puck ! sample tweet : @ donrickles just finished " @entity129 " - i keep telling @entity130 i 'm happily married 46 years , but she keeps saying we can work something out ! queen @entity133 it 's not every day you find real - live royalty on networking sites			1
but not all royals are @entity133 , the queen of @entity139			1
she 's answered questions of followers online and told interviewers that sites like @entity1 can be used to achieve real social change			1
but we 're particularly fond of her @entity1 bio : " a mum and a wife with a really cool day job			1
" her more - than 1.8 million followers seem to agree			0
sample tweet : @ @entity154 special day			0
my youngest turns 7 & his majesty 50 ! one life full of potential , the other full of accomplishments			0
# @entity161 @entity162 how much direct input does his holiness have in running this account ? it 's , of course , hard to say			1
but while the frenetic pace of the micro-blogging site might seem an unlikely home for the @entity174 leader 's gentle musings , the format works surprisingly well			1
few links , no " text - speak " ... and the thoughts certainly feel authentic			0
after a long day of @entity179 rants , this is as good a place as any for your moments of @entity1 zen			2
sample tweet : @ @entity162 if the twentieth century was a century of violence , let us make the twenty - first a century of dialogue			1
@entity187 " true believers " of a certain age will find @entity187 's tweets familiar			2
they 're clearly from the same mind that penned all of those back page letters that appeared in @entity195 comic books through the years			0
some of us here at @entity0 had a chance to meet the @entity187 a while back and it 's not surprising that , at 89 , he 's still got plenty to say			2
sample tweet : @ therealstanlee pres. @entity201 gave an actress an award and kissed her cheek			0
when i was to get my award i said , " we do n't haveta kiss , do we ? " we both broke up ! pope @entity208 why are we surprised to see him tweeting ? well , because he 's the pope , he 's kind of old school , and as the leader of more than a billion @entity213 worldwide , he probably has better things to do than sharpening his message into 140 - character chunks			2
maybe that 's why he 's tweeted only five times -- mostly inspirational nuggets -- since joining @entity1 last june			1
sample tweet : @ @entity222 the universe is not the result of chance			0
we are invited to read something profound into it : the inexhaustible creativity of @entity227 @entity228 except for her infrequent movie projects ( " burlesque , " anyone ? ) we do n't hear much from @entity228 these days			0
so it 's a little startling to see the 65 - year - old diva so prolific on @entity1 , where she has 478,000 followers			1
it 's not unusual to see @entity228 post more than a dozen tweets a day , engaging with fans about her music , politics and son @entity242			2
and , bless her , @entity228 's profile pic makes her look 35			0
sample tweet : @ cher when i tour i want to keep a @entity247 & get all the @entity248 to @entity1 with me @entity249 @entity249 may be 85 , but he 's no newbie to @entity1 -- the @entity252 founder fired off his first tweet back in 2008 , ahead of the cultural curve			1
these days the robed @entity255 is padding about the @entity256 while posting daily updates about his tv viewing and current girlfriends , @entity260 and former playmate @entity261			0
sometimes he even retweets their stuff			0
sample tweet : @ hughhefner both @entity261 & @entity260 have early modeling assignments tomorrow , so we 'll be going to bed early tonight			0
@entity268 we 're all fans of the gifted , yet troubled , ms. @entity268 here , so no disrespect intended			0
but when someone 's dead , it definitely qualifies as a surprise when you see them active on @entity1			1
sure , @entity268 's official account was managed by others even before her death on july 23 ( it was silent between july 7 - september 12 )			2
but it 's her name ... and seeing stuff pop up under it even still is just weird			0
sample tweet : @ amywinehouse @entity268 's final track " @entity285 " w / @ itstonybennett is out today on @entity287 , proceeds to the @entity289			0
@entity0 's @entity290 contributed to this report .			0
