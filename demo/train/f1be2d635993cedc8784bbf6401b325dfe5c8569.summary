@entity0 , @entity1 -- a court clerk at the trial of @entity5 , who was convicted of capital murder in a 2007 @entity1 home invasion , read tuesday from writings of @entity5 ' alleged accomplice describing the incident in graphic detail			1
" i swung again , and then again ... a look of stunned shock in his eyes , " wrote @entity5 about the nighttime attack with a bat on dr. @entity5 , who was sleeping on the porch when the attack began that july night , and proved to be the lone survivor			1
prosecutors allege @entity5 and @entity24 invaded the @entity26 home , beat @entity28 's husband bloody , strangled @entity28 , set the house afire and tried to flee			1
the crime shocked the well - to - do @entity0 suburb of @entity33 and drew national attention			2
the writings , read aloud to the jury by a court clerk during tuesday 's penalty phase of @entity5 ' trial , were selected from a 40 - page letter @entity24 wrote to author @entity41 in 2008			1
they describe the men moving on to the bedrooms where @entity5 and her daughters , 17 - year - old @entity5 and 11 - year - old @entity5 , lay sleeping			1
" all were compliant , " he wrote			2
" this time i took a risk , pulled the trigger , and the chamber was loaded			2
... the @entity28 family passed through their fears and into terror			2
... it was captivating , validating that this pain in me was real			0
... i was looking right at my personal demon , reflected back in their eyes			0
... @entity62 is a fighter ; she tried time and time again to free herself			0
... mr. @entity64 is a coward ; he ran away when he thought his life was threatened , and ran away to leave his wife and children to madmen			0
... i was cheated of my retribution , and so was @entity71			0
... i am what i am ; i make no excuses			0
... i 'm a criminal with a criminal mind			0
" police testified that , after finding evidence of a bank account containing $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 , the two forced @entity28 to go to a bank in the morning and withdraw money from the account			0
prosecutors said @entity5 took her to the bank while @entity24 stayed behind			1
when @entity5 and @entity28 returned with the money , the two men allegedly set the home afire and fled			1
inside the home , authorities said , @entity28 , 48 , was found raped and strangled			2
her two daughters , one of whom had been sexually assaulted , died of smoke inhalation			0
@entity28 , the sole survivor , escaped to a neighbor 's home			2
@entity24 added in his writings , " i 'm ultimately responsible for my own actions			1
... had mr. @entity64 fought back in the very beginning , i would have been forced to retreat			0
... you 're the first line of defense for your family , not law enforcement			2
" @entity28 , who was in the courtroom , showed no visible reaction as these passages were read			2
afterward , outside the courthouse , he told reporters , " i really do n't want to dignify the ravings of a sociopath who appears to be a pathological liar as well			0
" referring to the 11 - year - old , @entity24 continued , " i tasted her fear			1
" after she was dead , he wrote , he took " blackmail pictures " of her body that he " intended to use against mr. and mrs. @entity28			0
... what i was not prepared for was my demons getting the better of me			0
" the reading continued : " how could i have gone oh so far , far wrong ? ... @entity119 , angel of my nightmares , my pain to yours does not compare			0
... you call me from beyond the grave			0
... if only i could simply lie here and will myself to die			0
... @entity119 , @entity62 , and @entity127 , forgive me ; i am damned			0
... i ca n't believe i lost control ; i hate myself / i love myself			0
" @entity24 added , " my forthcoming death sentence will be an action of mercy			1
" prosecutors had objected to the defense 's plan to read excerpts of @entity24 's letters and journal , calling the writings " fiction and fantasy			1
" " it 's kind of like ' @entity144 according to @entity145 , ' " prosecutor @entity141 told judge @entity142			0
but @entity5 ' attorney , @entity146 , said the writings show that @entity24 -- who is to be tried separately -- " is the mastermind here ... and mr. @entity5 ' culpability is less			1
" @entity151 denied the prosecutors ' motion to bar the writings , saying , " mr. @entity5 is fighting for his life at this stage , and he 's allowed great latitude			1
" @entity5 , 47 , was convicted earlier this month of 16 of the 17 charges against him -- including nine counts of murder and capital murder and four counts of kidnapping -- in the deaths of @entity28 and her two daughters			1
after hearing testimony in the penalty phase , the same jurors who convicted @entity5 must decide if he should be executed			1
earlier in the day , the writings read like a how - to manual on breaking into homes			2
" my fundamental trademark is cat - type burglaries , " @entity24 wrote			1
" i 'm a burglar ; everybody knows i 'm a burglar			0
... you 'd be surprised what people contract me to steal			0
" " as my skill progressed over the years , i 've reached the point where i can get into a house without any tools , only night vision , " @entity24 wrote			1
when he believes a home 's occupants are sleeping heavily , " i make my way to the breaker room and start shutting down the electricity			2
... i have night vision ; they have darkness			0
" four journals were found in @entity24 's cell , testified @entity193 , a detective with the @entity195 major crimes unit			1
in the journals , which were seized by authorities , @entity24 discusses the @entity33 case , he said			1
@entity193 testified that what he read in the journals led him to believe @entity24 was communicating with @entity41 , whom @entity193 described as " a book author			1
" visitor logs showed that @entity41 had visited @entity24 once , he testified			1
in the penalty phase , jurors are allowed to consider evidence they heard during the guilt phase of the trial			0
they can also consider new testimony or evidence that attorneys introduce , which might include the defendant 's long history of prior convictions and anything that casts @entity5 in a positive light			1
the defense offered testimony monday from witnesses who had interacted with @entity5 through work , from his apartment complex or because of his drug addiction			1
that testimony continued tuesday with @entity222 , a building contractor who said he knew @entity5 through his girlfriend and gave him work as a painter			1
@entity229 described @entity5 as a hard worker and said he loaned @entity231 his truck on the weekend the attack took place , but " on monday morning he failed to show up			1
" he told jurors he had met @entity24 before , and tried to call him after @entity5 did not show up			1
when he first heard from the police , he said , he thought @entity5 " had done something stupid			2
" when he heard what @entity5 was accused of , @entity229 said , he was " shocked			2
... i could n't believe it			0
" @entity5 has said he will not offer a victim impact statement during @entity5 ' penalty phase , saying in a statement he " regretfully " decided against doing so because @entity1 's law on victim impact statements is unclear and could provide convicts with grounds to appeal their sentences			2
after wednesday , when just one witness is scheduled to testify , no testimony will occur as the judge and attorneys work on jury instructions			0
testimony is to resume monday .			0
