@entity0 , @entity1 -- rebels pushed thursday northward on three fronts toward the coastal cities of @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 , with their ultimate goal being @entity0 , rebel field commander @entity3 told @entity2			1
six rebels died and dozens more were wounded in fighting wednesday and thursday , he said			1
he predicted that the fighters would reach the coastal road that leads to the capital city within days			1
@entity7 is strategically important because the coastal road through the city is the main supply line from the @entity19 border to areas held by @entity1 leader @entity21			1

fighting was continuing around @entity25 , where rebel spokesman @entity26 said the main hospital reported four rebels killed and 54 wounded			1
meanwhile , in @entity31 , a spokesperson for @entity30 said the @entity38 secretary - general " is deeply concerned by reports of the unacceptably large number of civilian casualties as a result of the conflict in @entity1			1
" @entity30 is urging " all @entity1 parties " to engage with his special envoy , @entity39 , " and respond concretely and positively to the ideas presented to them , in order to end the bloodshed in the country , " the spokesperson said			2
his remarks came three days after allegations that a @entity48 strike in the village of @entity50 near @entity51 wound up killing 85 civilians --- 33 children , 32 women and 20 men			0
the @entity0 government called it " a massaacre " of civilians ; @entity48 has said its warplanes struck two farms used as a staging point for @entity21 's forces " this is a legitimate target			2
and by striking it , @entity48 has reduced pro-gadhafi forces capabilities to threaten and attack civilians , " said col. @entity65 , a spokesman for the @entity48 operation			0
" we do not have evidence of civilian casualties at this stage , although casualties among military personnel , including mercenaries , are very likely due to the nature of the target			0
" but , on tuesday , officials from the government in @entity0 escorted international journalists to a mass funeral in @entity80 , and to the site where the government and residents said the @entity48 airstrike killed civilians			2
journalists saw the bodies of children and women among the dead and wounded at the site of the attack			0
it was impossible for @entity2 to confirm the extent of the casualties			0
a spokesman for the @entity0 government , @entity97 , called it " a crime beyond imagination			1
" for weeks , @entity48 warplanes have been bombing @entity51 on a daily basis			0
meanwhile , rebels have been pressing toward @entity51 's eastern gates from the nearby opposition - held port of @entity25			0
speaking to journalists in @entity80 on tuesday , @entity26 accused @entity48 of bombing @entity108 to clear the way for rebels to advance on the @entity21 - controlled city of @entity51 , a few kilometers north			0
maj. gen. @entity112 , spokesman for the @entity114 @entity113 , said thursday that @entity114 aircraft have been in action in recent days " as part of @entity48 's mission to protect civilians at risk of attack from col. @entity21 's former regime			1
" the latest operations included @entity114 aircraft carrying out precision airstrikes on several sites in and around @entity51 , @entity112 said in a statement			0
the report of civilian deaths stirred anger in @entity131			2
" if such reports are true , it further highlights the increased risks to civilians that has occurred as a result of military intervention in @entity1 and is further evidence that continued bombing by @entity48 ... is an inappropriate tool to protect civilians or force @entity21 from power , " wrote rep. @entity132 in a letter to @entity30			2
" how can they continue to cause the deaths of innocent civilians under the color of international law and not be held accountable ? " the @entity147 @entity146 continued			0
the changing nature of who controls what in @entity1 was underscored thursday by events in @entity131 , where the @entity1 @entity157 officially reopened under the control of the @entity159			1
" this is a message that @entity21 can no more rule @entity1 , " said @entity160 , who was accredited thursday as head of the @entity1 mission			1
@entity165 said he talked thursday with @entity167 officials about the @entity170 administration 's efforts to help the @entity159 gain access to some $ 30 billion in frozen @entity1 assets			1
the @entity167 had ordered the embassy closed in march and expelled diplomats loyal to @entity21			0
@entity160 had resigned his post as the @entity21 regime 's ambassador to the @entity178 in february and has since represented the opposition in @entity131			2
the @entity178 on july 15 recognized the rebel movement based in @entity181 as @entity1 's rightful government			1
