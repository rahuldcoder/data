@entity0 -- talk about a tall order			0
a @entity3 that can agree on little has 12 scheduled work days to forge a compromise on one of the most volatile issues -- immigration -- before going home for all of august			2
failure to find agreement in the next three weeks means no immediate help for a @entity14 immigration system overwhelmed by tens of thousands of children from @entity16 illegally entering the country in recent months			1
republicans and @entity19 are refining their opening positions this week as officials scramble to keep up with the unprecedented influx amid the hyperpartisan political climate of a congressional election year			0
both sides appear supportive of spending more money			0
the sticking points involve how much to spend on what , as well as the broader policy issue of who gets deported and how fast			0
what 's happened so far facing chronic violence at home and motivated by the belief they wo n't get sent back by the @entity14 , an unprecedented surge of unaccompanied minors from @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 continues traveling through @entity41 to cross the border into @entity43			1
administration officials told a congressional hearing last week that almost 60,000 arrived since october 1 , with up to 30,000 more expected by the end of the current fiscal year on september 30 -- well over twice the figure of the previous year			0
they face an immigration limbo of overcrowded holding centers , followed by transfer or release to await deportation hearings that can take months or years to happen and many do n't attend			0
president @entity55 last week requested $ 3.7 billion in emergency funding from @entity3 to respond to what his administration calls an urgent humanitarian situation			1
the request includes $ 1.8 billion to provide temporary care for children while they are in government custody , and $ 1.6 billion to bolster customs and border efforts while cracking down on smugglers			1
another $ 300 million would help @entity41 and the @entity16 governments discourage desperate parents from paying smugglers to get their children into the @entity14			1
also , the @entity71 announced monday it had sent about 40 recent arrivals including adults and children back to their home country of @entity38			1
it said more deportations to the three @entity16 nations were expected soon			1
first group of @entity38 deported from new @entity14 facility @entity80 contend @entity55 created the problem by halting deportations of some child immigrants in recent years , a move they say invited more to come			1
they want any additional resources now to bolster border security and swiftly send back the new arrivals			2
@entity19 argue that additional resources should speed up the processing of the child immigrants , with faster hearings to determine if they have the right to stay and quicker deportations if a judge issues a removal order			2
meanwhile , the divisive issue plays out on streets in some affected areas , with protesters in one @entity100 town blocking buses transporting new arrivals to temporary facilities			0
the @entity104 a @entity80 working group appointed by @entity104 speaker @entity106 to come up with recommendations for legislation reports back tuesday , with its findings expected to outline the @entity80 negotiating stance			0
@entity106 already is under pressure from @entity55 and @entity19 to bring up a broad @entity113 - passed immigration reform measure that would boost border security while providing a path to legal status for millions of longtime undocumented immigrants in the country			1
conservatives oppose the @entity113 plan as an amnesty , knowing it would add millions of likely @entity19 voters to election rolls			0
however , moderate @entity80 fear continued @entity80 resistance to immigration reform supported by a broad coalition of business , faith and social leaders undermines the party 's chances to increase its popularity with @entity133 -- the nation 's largest minority and an increasingly crucial election demographic			0
@entity106 and other @entity80 leaders may consider the current border crisis an opportunity to show their willingness to agree on a narrow immigration measure while avoiding the sweep of comprehensive reforms pushed by @entity55 and @entity19 in the @entity113 proposal			1
the 2008 trafficking law republicans and some @entity19 appear focused on changing a 2008 law designed to crack down on child trafficking			0
the @entity149 requires deportation hearings for child immigrants who show up at the border from all countries except for @entity14 neighbors @entity41 and @entity155			1
it distinguished between neighboring and non-bordering countries because @entity41 or @entity155 turned back at the border are in their home country , unlike those from @entity16 nations and elsewhere			1
@entity163 border bill proposed a proposal by two @entity43 legislators -- @entity80 sen. @entity166 and @entity19 rep. @entity167 -- would remove the hearing requirement , treating child immigrants from all countries the same			1
to address @entity19 concerns , the measure also would allow children who are the victims of human trafficking or have a credible threat of persecution to appear before a judge to seek asylum in the @entity14 , with a decision required within 72 hours of a child 's claim			1
it was unclear if the @entity166 - @entity167 proposal would gain support from @entity185 , while a group of conservative southern @entity104 @entity19 planned to meet monday night with homeland security secretary @entity187 to discuss the issue			0
no @entity113 @entity19 have signed onto the @entity166 - @entity167 plan , with several party leaders including assistant majority leader @entity191 of @entity192 , @entity194 chairman @entity193 of @entity195 and @entity197 chairman @entity196 of @entity198 expressing skepticism at the concept			0
@entity191 set two conditions for his support : legal representation for child immigrants at deportation hearings , and proper social conditions back home if they get deported			2
the @entity166 - @entity167 proposal relies on existing law that calls on the @entity209 to seek out pro bono legal counsel for the child immigrants , but it contains no requirement that they have legal counsel			2
" i think that would be a disaster for our immigration system , " @entity166 said , warning of a prolonged hearing process that would " serve the goal of some of the people who want to come because it would be years before they were ever deported			2
" at the @entity104 , spokesman @entity222 said monday that talks with legislators continued on possible revisions to the 2008 law , or leaving it intact while coming up with a separate proposal to give @entity187 more flexibility			2
@entity222 made clear that the administration wants arriving immigrants to get a full determination of their legal right to stay in the country			0
" we certainly would ensure that they receive the due process to which they are entitled , " @entity222 said			0
" but once that due process has run its course , if it 's found that those individuals do not have a legal basis for remaining in the country , we would like the secretary of homeland security to be able to exercise the discretion necessary to repatriate that individual or those individuals			0
" political fallout with all 435 @entity104 seats and about a third of the @entity113 up for election in november , both parties seek maximum political advantage from the issue			0
@entity80 criticize @entity55 's policies for causing the border crisis and complain his administration has been slow to react			2
some democrats joined @entity80 in saying the president should have gone to the @entity43 border to witness the situation for himself when he visited the @entity43 last week			1
@entity55 and @entity19 argue the broad reforms they support , which @entity104 @entity80 have blocked after the @entity113 passed them , demonstrate their commitment to the plight of immigrants			1
@entity222 noted that @entity55 proposed his $ 3.7 billion emergency funding request last week , with no substantive response as yet			1
" we 've seen a lot of talk from @entity80 about how urgent and pressing the situation is , but not a lot of action when it comes to acting on ... a detailed proposal that the president put forward eight days ago , " he said			2
in a display of the high stakes involved , the @entity104 planned to meet wednesday with the @entity279 to discuss concerns over expedited deportations , and also provide a briefing on @entity55 's funding request to the @entity113			1
use ' safe zones ' to end immigrant crisis @entity1 's @entity286 , @entity287 and @entity288 contributed to this report .			0
