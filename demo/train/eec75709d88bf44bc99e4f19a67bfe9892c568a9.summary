-- @entity1 , who made history as the first amputee to run a marathon , has a message of hope and triumph to those who lost limbs during the @entity11 bombings			1
" if i lost a leg in @entity16 , you know what i would be thinking of is that i 'm going to come back next year and slay the monster , " said @entity1 , who ran the @entity12 in 1976 on a prosthetic leg			1
@entity19 , now 72 , participated in last week 's @entity11 in a hand - cranked wheelchair			1
he finished the race three hours before the twin explosions struck near the marathon 's finish line , killing three and wounding more than 260			2
his personal story demonstrates how the victims of last week 's @entity16 terror bombings can overcome the devastating setback of losing a limb			1
at least 13 of those injured in the @entity16 attacks underwent amputations			2
while it might sound crazy to even think about running 26.2 miles after a devastating injury , @entity19 has invited the amputees to join him and his nonprofit group of disabled runners , @entity36 , to participate in next year 's @entity11			1
" i would tell them the marathon is a lunatic fringe , but as they progress out of the hospital , we 'd love to have them join us in @entity16 , " said @entity1 , who lost his leg when a car hit him in 1965			1
his work with disabled athletes earned him a @entity50 nomination last year			0
the patients do n't have to run in the first year of recuperation -- although it 's been done before			1
newcomer amputees can use hand - cranked wheelchairs as @entity19 did this year , in an act of mercy on his 72 - year - old joints			0
as these victims work on physically recovering from their injuries , they also must cope with the emotional shock of losing a part of their body			1
" i do n't think i ever had a more horrifying moment in my life than when i pulled the cover up after my surgery and i saw my leg was gone , " said @entity66 , a triathlete and softball player who lost her right leg below the knee four years ago at age 23			1
" it was like , this is your life now and there 's no looking back			0
unfortunately you ca n't grow a limb back , and it is very frightening			0
" while she did not compete in this year 's @entity11 , she had an emotional reaction after learning of the horrendous attacks			1
" my first reaction was i just want to give them a hug , to let them know they will be ok , " @entity66 said			1
" i have no doubt in my mind that any of the marathoners who lost a limb will run a marathon again			1
" waking to the new reality can be tortuous			0
the patients confront the anguish of a loss just short of life itself , and yet they must find a way to advance themselves			1
" the initial phase of recovery for the victim is going to be psychological , accepting what happened to them and stop asking ' why did this happen to me ? ' and move forward to the next step , " said @entity103 , senior director of programs for the @entity105 , which supports people with disabilities in their pursuit of athletics and an active life			1
dr. @entity118 , executive vice chair of emergency medicine at @entity120 , which treated victims of the marathon blasts , described recovery as " an extended process			1
" " it 's going to take a long time , " @entity118 said			0
" as the patients come to more realization as to what happened , there 's going to be a lot of work to be done in a lot of places			1
" everyone is going to figure how to go forward , " he said			0
opinion : amputees never say ' i ca n't ' @entity140 and friends will play key roles in overcoming grief and depression			0
" there 's so many times when i got down on myself , and my confidence would waver , and parents and friends would say ' you can do this , hang on , ' " @entity66 said			0
" they tried to be as encouraging as possible			0
that helped me cope a lot			0
" @entity154 , a quadruple amputee , urged the victims to be resilient			1
as hard as it may seem , life does improve , she said			0
her limbs were removed in 2006 after she suffered from @entity160 's disease and organ failure brought on by septic shock			1
" i 've been there , and i could tell them that it gets better			0
just never give up , " @entity166 said			1
counseling and physical therapy become like a " full - time job , " she said			0
" that 's huge , " she said , " because for a long time i did n't want to take any pills that would make me happy			0
i did n't want to accept that i needed the medication to stabilize			0
" you have to realize that it 's not forever , " she continued			0
" it 's something that you have to deal with and fight , and keep fighting			1
" the rewards can be profound			0
" you will love yourself even more afterwards because of how much you have gone through and overcome , " @entity166 said			0
" and other people probably will never be able to relate			0
and in a way that 's a good thing , because they did n't have the opportunity to have a near - death experience and live			0
" @entity184 ran this week 's @entity11 as a guide to an amputee runner who had completed a sports camp operated by @entity184 's getting 2 @entity188			1
the two men were about four blocks from the finish line when they heard the bomb blast , which @entity184 said sounded like a garbage truck dropping a dumpster			2
he and amputee runner @entity195 were n't injured			2
@entity184 attests to how science keeps improving an amputee 's quality of life			2
his foundation promotes people with disabilities swimming , cycling , running and racing wheelchairs as a way to integrate in their communities			0
" we 're at a point in this country where the technology is much more advanced than 20 years ago regarding prosthetic limbs , " @entity184 said			2
" it used to be , 20 years ago , you got an ugly rubber foot and it was n't very functional			0
and now they 're very functional			0
" insurance companies will pay for a prosthetic leg used for walking , but they do n't typically cover prosthetic legs used for running or cycling , which can cost between $ 25,000 and $ 40,000 each , said @entity219 of the @entity105			2
that 's why the foundation awards annual grants -- $ 1.9 million to more than 1,200 para-athletes around the world this month -- to pay for the running prosthetic legs and other adaptive equipment , @entity219 said			2
the foundation has also started a fundraising web page for the @entity16 victims who lost limbs			1
@entity66 , 27 , did n't trust her prosthetic leg at first			2
would it support her next step ? she spent about six months learning how to walk on it			0
after two more months , she learned how to run			2
" i feared falling , " said @entity66 , who was a collegiate softball player when she broke her leg sliding into second base on a steal , leading to infection and ultimately amputation			1
" and there 's always a fear that if i ca n't run , then it would be a reminder of what my life used to be , that i would never be that speedy little center fielder			2
my entire life i identified myself as an athlete			2
" eight months after she learned how to run , she tested her old identity : she signed up for a women 's softball league in @entity251 , @entity252 , as the only amputee in the league , she said			1
she conquered the amputation in her first at - bat , she recounted proudly			2
she hit a home run			1
and because the field had no fence and an outfielder chased down the ball , she enjoyed no home run trot			1
@entity0 's @entity263 contributed to this report .			0

para-athletes offer hope to @entity11 blast victims who lost limbs
recovery is " an extended process " as patients deal with amputation , a *doctor* says
" just never give up , " a quadruple amputee urges
an athlete who lost a leg below the knee at age 23 tells of her *comeback* with a home run
