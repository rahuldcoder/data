@entity1 rep. @entity0 may have attended a gathering of a white supremacist group , @entity5 , the former @entity6 leader who founded the group said on @entity2 saturday			1
" i 've got conflicting reports , " @entity5 told @entity2 's @entity8			1
" one person said that he was a no - show , that he was scheduled to come — one person said that he did come			0
i just do n't know what the truth is			0
" @entity15 added that " it seems that mr. @entity0 thinks he may have			1
that 's why he 's — he 's covering himself			0
" @entity15 was in @entity18 at the time of the 2002 conference of the @entity21 , considered by many civil rights groups to be a hate group			1
the event in question has drawn intense scrutiny after a local @entity28 political blogger uncovered comments on an online forum suggesting @entity0 spoke there in 2002			1
the controversy surrounding @entity0 's appearance has sparked calls for the @entity28 @entity35 to resign from his @entity37 @entity35 leadership position and created unwanted headaches for the @entity35 as they prepare to take over full control of @entity40 next week			2
while he said he remains murky on the actual details of who spoke at the event thirteen years ago , @entity15 threatened to " name names " of lawmakers with whom he 's " had relationships " if they continue to attack @entity0			1
" i would name names of any @entity48 — and i know some @entity49 and @entity35 in the @entity37 — who tried , in fact urged me , to support them , " he said			2
he added while he respects the privacy of those with whom he 's had relationships , " i would call them out if they [ were ] hypocritical			0
" @entity0 himself has said while he does n't remember speaking to the group , he may have , as he was barnstorming his district as a state representative seeking support for a proposal			1
the lawmaker has distanced himself from the group 's viewpoints and apologized for speaking there , calling it a " mistake			0
" but conflicting reports from @entity15 and his advisor , @entity70 , who organized the event , continue to raise questions about what actually happened that day			2
@entity70 has said previously @entity0 did n't in fact speak to the group , and only came to talk to a meeting of a civic association gathering before the @entity21 event			1
@entity15 on saturday insisted that even if @entity0 spoke to his group , they were not supporters of one another			1
" i was not his supporter , he was not my supporter			0
i did not contribute to him , he did not contribute to me , okay ? " @entity5 said			2
" he was not a member of my organization — he was an early young representative who just got elected in @entity28 , and he was pushing a tax program , and he was coming to constituents			0
and again , i believe that every elected official has a responsibility to hear out people who are right wing , left wing			0
" @entity15 also downplayed the controversy surrounding his group , comparing it to the @entity95 , a hispanic - american rights group , or the @entity97 , an @entity98 rights group , and noting that elected officials speak to both of those without blowback			1
" but he came to a @entity104 organization — big problem , " he noted			0
" and do n't forget , he was an elected official			0
so what is @entity107 all about ? do n't we , are n't we supposed to believe that if you 're an elected official ... you 're representing all the people in your district ? " @entity15 said that at the time he was a very popular figure in @entity28 , forging multiple unsuccessful statewide runs and at one point contemplating a run for president			2
and @entity15 alleged that the " national media " was " racist " and may have contributed to the controversy			2
" maybe the national media , which i consider to be very racist against @entity121 , i think that they have really caused the incitement of @entity98 against @entity121 , and i also think that they 've also facilitated @entity121 being angry against @entity98 , " he said .			0

@entity5 said saturday that rep. @entity0 " may have " attended a gathering of his group in 2002
he defended the group as *similar* to @entity98 or @entity129 rights groups
@entity15 threatened to " name names " of lawmakers who have sought his support
