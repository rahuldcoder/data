-- even in the midst of the @entity3 , there was still one thing the @entity5 shared -- a serious addiction to caffeine			1
@entity9 troops were less likely to get a cup of coffee			1
in that respect , the @entity12 clearly had an advantage			0
not only did the @entity16 have more than two - thirds of the population and control most of the heavy industry , railroads , and financial reserves in the country , it hoarded supplies of the highly addictive little bean , leaving the @entity9 to wage its own war against java deprivation			1
coffee : it 's what 's for breakfast , lunch and dinner throughout the @entity3 , coffee was as prevalent on the battlefields as it is in offices today			1
in fact , the @entity12 army was fueled by the stuff to the point that , if there was no time to boil water , the @entity40 would chew on whole beans as they marched			1
and at night , @entity12 campsites were dotted with tiny fires , each boiling a pot of coffee like a million miniature @entity50			2
beyond caffeine cravings , @entity12 troops loved their coffee because it was , literally , the best thing on the menu			1
before the advent of helpful ( and tasty ! ) artificial preservatives , a marching soldier 's rations were neither varied nor particularly appetizing			0
typically , they consisted of salted meat , unleavened bread ( accurately christened " hardtack " ) , and a little sugar and salt			0
it did n't help that @entity12 supply chains were riddled with corrupt food contractors who charged the government top dollar for rotten , stale , and insect - ridden foodstuffs			0
coffee , however , was almost always fresh because it was delivered in whole - bean form -- making it difficult for even the most dishonest supplier to skimp on quality			2
not that they did n't try , of course			0
in fact , officials began requesting coffee as whole beans after some crooked contractors tried to up their per - pound profits by slipping sand and dirt into packages of ground coffee			1
in 1861 , hoping to cut down on the time soldiers spent roasting and grinding beans , the army switched to a concentrated proto - instant coffee			1
the new concoction , called " essence of coffee , " was made by boiling prepared coffee , milk , and sugar into a thick gloop , which soldiers then reconstituted by mixing it with water			2
the product reportedly tasted every bit as bad as you 'd imagine , and thanks to the corrupt dairymen who sold the army spoiled milk , it also tended to cause diarrhea			0
needless to say , the @entity12 army was soon back on the bean			0
southern discomfort @entity116 as essence of coffee was , @entity9 soldiers would have gladly downed a cup or two			1
but , because of a @entity12 naval blockade , coffee ( along with weapons , machinery , medicine , and other vital materials ) was in short supply in the @entity125			1
before the war , a pound of beans would have set you back around 20 cents in yankee dough			2
once pre-war stockpiles ran out , however , the same amount was running as high as $ 60 in @entity9 money			1
( despite the undervalued currency , that was still a lot			0
) there was some coffee that made it into the @entity9 -- usually carried by steam - powered blockade - runner ships			1
but , for the most part , @entity125 had to rely on coffee substitutes , including various forms of roasted corn , rye , okra seeds , sweet potatoes , acorns , and peanuts			2
unfortunately , all these imitations lacked potency , tasted awful , and upset the bowels			0
the only slightly better alternative was tea made from the leaves of the native yaupon shrub			0
the good news was that it contained caffeine ; the bad news was that it was incredibly difficult to digest			0
luckily , there was one surefire way for @entity125 folk to get their coffee -- by making peace with the @entity12			2
soldiers on the front lines often called informal truces so @entity169 could swap tobacco for @entity172 coffee and then dash back to their camps before they were reported missing			0
