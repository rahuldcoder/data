-- the other night , as i sat in the telescope operation room at the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , preparing with colleagues to measure light from some of the most distant galaxies known , the phone rang with startling news			1
an exploding star had been sighted in @entity13 , one of the nearest big galaxies			1
the " supernova " ( as such stellar explosions are called ) was a special , rare " @entity18 " -- the kind that led to the @entity21 - worthy discovery of dark energy			1
@entity18 supernovae have happened in our galactic neighborhood only three times in the last 80 years			1
like astronomers around the world , we were excited to be at a world - leading telescope , where we could collect new information about this rare event			2
the new supernova , @entity34 , is 11.4 million light - years from @entity35 , a mere stone 's throw in cosmic terms			1
the previous record - holders were found in 1937 ( 14 million light - years away ) and 1972 ( 16 million light - years away )			1
supernovae occur at the end of a star 's life when its furnace runs out of fuel			2
because gravity then overcomes the star 's ability to remain puffed up , there is a violent collapse , followed by an explosion that produces radioactive elements such as nickel and cobalt			2
most of the light we see from a supernova is emitted as those radioactive elements decay , so the brightness falls sharply over a period of weeks			1
incidentally , all the iron in your blood came from the decay of radioactive nickel manufactured in a stellar explosion			0
so most of the atoms in your body were once in the interiors of stars			0
because supernovae change brightness very quickly compared with galaxies ( months compared with billions of years for galaxies ) , we quickly diverted the @entity4 telescope from our intended targets to @entity34			1
our galaxies will look the same another night , but the supernova wo n't			1
amazingly , a professor and his students at the @entity83 had discovered @entity34 well before it reached its peak brightness			0
" the weather was closing in , with increasing cloud , " said professor @entity85			0
" so instead of the planned practical astronomy class , i gave the students an introductory demonstration of how to use the ccd camera on one of the observatory 's automated 0.35 - meter telescopes			0
" deciding to look at @entity13 was almost pure luck -- there were fewer clouds in that direction , and the galaxy was pretty and bright			1
but @entity85 quickly noticed @entity13 did n't look right : it seemed to contain a bright new star			1
he realized this might be a supernova and , together with his students , worked feverishly to rule out other explanations ( such as a flaw in the camera or an asteroid in our galaxy appearing to pass by @entity13 )			1
in short order , the discovery of the new supernova was confirmed , and the e-mail alerts and notifications began			2
@entity116 , one of the students , said , " one minute we 're eating pizza , then five minutes later we 've helped to discover a supernova			0
i could n't believe it			0
" the only supernova that 's more extraordinary is @entity122 , which was discovered in 1987			0
it is in a tiny satellite galaxy orbiting the @entity125 , about 160,000 light - years away and 70 times closer than @entity34			2
here 's an analogy for the vast distances across which we see supernovae : imagine if @entity122 were on the back porch			0
then @entity34 would be just down the street ; a garden - variety nearby supernovae would be in the next town , and the most distant supernovae would be over in the next state			0
space is very empty -- there are only a few big galaxies near us			1
on average , the distance to the nearest big galaxy is about 100 times its size			1
but space is also huge , and there are billions of galaxies			0
in an ordinary big galaxy such as the @entity125 , one supernova -- of any type -- happens only every hundred years or so			1
but since there are so many galaxies in the universe , millions of supernovae go off every year			2
from @entity35 , we can see hundreds of these			0
one recipe we can use to find a supernova is to take pictures of a few hundred galaxies , repeat a few weeks later and look for the difference			2
the supernova will look like an overly bright star compared with the galaxy in which it lies			0
finding one supernova in several hundred galaxies is equivalent to staring at one galaxy for several hundred years			1
@entity13 is an unusual galaxy because it has a high rate of star formation			2
that 's why two other supernovae were found in @entity13 as recently as 2008 and 2004			1
but they were not the special @entity18 supernovae			0
because we have a good idea of how much light is emitted by @entity18 , the brightness we observe is a direct indicator of the distance to the host galaxy			2
this makes @entity18 supernovae incredibly valuable for measuring cosmic distances			1
careful observations of @entity18 across the universe were essential to measuring the expansion history of the universe over billions of years			2
this led directly to the discovery of dark energy , a sort of fifth fundamental force that is now one of the most important unknowns in physics or astronomy			1
the reason @entity18 supernovae are special is their uniformity			0
basically , they all explode at about the same mass , so they are all roughly equally luminous			0
better understanding the physics of that explosion and the effect of local galactic environment will make @entity18 even better " standard candles " and improve our understanding of the properties of dark energy and the cosmological evolution of the universe			1
the more data we can get , and the closer the supernova , the better the calibration			0
we are lucky that @entity34 was discovered about two weeks before it will reach its maximum brightness , rather than after			0
for the next week or so , the data will get better as the supernova gets brighter			0
on tuesday night , it was reported to be 11th magnitude ( astronomer units ) , which is about 100 times fainter than can be seen with the naked eye			0
but it should get at least 10 times brighter , with a maximum around 8th magnitude -- not visible to the naked eye but certainly discernible with a good pair of binoculars			0
@entity13 lies far north in the sky , in the constellation @entity230 , near the @entity231 , above the @entity231 's bowl and about a third of the way over toward @entity235 , the @entity236			2
so if you can see the @entity231 and the @entity236 , take a shot at seeing one of the most unusual supernovae in your lifetime			0
of course , you ca n't get too excited about the timing			0
we see this light 11.4 million years after the explosion happened , because of the time light takes to reach our galaxy			1
so it was a really special time in @entity13 11.4 million years ago			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			2

in one of the nearest big galaxies , @entity13 , a rare type of supernova exploded
@entity250 : its uniform luminosity makes it valuable in measuring cosmic distance
she says finding supernovae has led directly to the discovery of dark energy
@entity250 : we are seeing this light 11.4 million years after the real explosion
