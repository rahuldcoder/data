-- giant natural disasters have a way of putting everything in perspective			1
when it comes to politics , they sometimes put it all in the wrong perspective			2
with nature suddenly grabbing our attention with both hands and reminding us we have much less control over our world and our lives than we believed , everything else moves to the background			1
like a diagnosis of a deadly disease or another personal tragedy , when the earth itself has unleashed its wrath , we look at all that transpires around us through the lens of the new overpowering reality			2
in the aftermath of a natural disaster , opinions about politicians , about leaders , can change			1
covering natural disasters and politics around the world , i have seen people change political opinions			1
and then wish they had not			2
politics : will you be able to vote on @entity42 ? a country 's leader will receive the credit or the blame for what comes during and after the event , somehow blinding many voters to all they knew about him or her before			1
of course , the chief executive does bear responsibility			2
and the response to a major crisis should be used as one gauge of leadership			0
but there is a tendency to suffer temporary amnesia : nothing matters but the reality of the moment			0
everything else is clouded in a fog of temporary irrelevance			0
there are plenty of examples of a temporary surge of emotion following a disaster , which later receded into regret			1
each country is different and no circumstances are identical			0
but it 's worth noting the experiences of other voters			1
will @entity79 affect your vote ? i arrived in @entity83 not long after the massive earthquake and tsunami that devastated @entity86 in december of 2004			1
@entity83 voters were scheduled to go to the polls just a few weeks later			1
prime minister @entity89 rolled up his sleeves and got to work on the crisis			0
he traveled to the regions wiped away by the tidal wave , he visited the survivors , showed himself on television leading the rescue and recovery effort , giving instructions to local officials , refusing international aid , declaring proudly that @entity83 could take care of itself			1
the voters ate it up			1
amid the devastation , anxiety and uncertainty , it was reassuring to see a man in charge			0
and the response was , for the most part , quite good			0
before the storm , @entity89 's party was losing ground			1
but when the february elections came , voters turned out in droves for the prime minister 's party , giving him a landslide victory			1
the seeming consensus did not last long			0
@entity89 was eventually deposed and charged with corruption			0
the @entity127 earthquake , tsunami , and nuclear meltdown last year threw a political lifeline to then - prime minister @entity131 the prime minister , wearing worker 's clothes , appeared to be in control of the situation			1
but as time passed and the @entity127 started questioning the government 's response to the disaster , his approval ratings collapsed and he ended up resigning			1
in 2007 , a violent earthquake shook @entity142			0
president @entity143 moved his presidential offices to the disaster zone			1
he brought his cabinet with him and personally managed -- some say micro-managed -- the response			0
his political advisers were delighted with the impact			1
polls showed 76 % of @entity142 approved of his handling of the crisis			1
his personal approval rating soared			1
after the crisis , the polls started sliding again , dropping to dismal levels , as if the earthquake and his heroic efforts had never happened			2
in @entity163 in 2010 , one of the world 's strongest earthquakes came just after an election			1
the outgoing government was criticized for failing on many fronts			0
the newly elected @entity168 ± era benefited from the disaster			2
the businessman - turned - politician was praised for his effective management style , and he used it to give himself a lower baseline from which to be judged			0
" this calamity is much deeper , much more damaging and much more serious than we thought , " he said			0
as others , his approval ratings were bolstered by his competent response to the disaster			1
but they later collapsed like a ramshackle building in an earthquake			0
voters discovered there was more to a good presidency than an impressive display of post-earthquake leadership			2
when the response is ineffectual and it fits in with a particular narrative , however , the impact can be indelible			0
that was the case with @entity193 and @entity194			0
the " heck of a job , @entity196 " cluelessness matched an impression of carelessness and incompetence			0
natural disasters , like violent storms , can reshape the political landscape			1
sometimes the topography returns to its previous state			0
sometimes it is changed forever			0
when a major calamity strikes just before an election , it is a test for politicians , as many have observed			0
that 's why in the @entity214 , with just a week to go before the presidential election , both camps are handling the aftermath of @entity79 with excruciating political care			1
that 's the politicians ' challenge			2
opinion : @entity79 debunks ' nanny state ' there is also an important -- an even more important -- challenge for voters			1
this is a time of maximum manipulation			0
it is a time when political operators will seek to mold perceptions to craft a political outcome ; to score votes			2
voters must make a superhuman effort to not let the storm carry any more weight than it deserves in their judgment of politicians ; not to let the storm wash away the knowledge about the candidates and their ideas accumulated over a much longer period			2
the storm and its aftermath do matter			2
we want a president who is competent and capable , able to guide the country through a crisis			0
a presidency is more than crisis management			0
the storm has indeed given us useful information			0
it has reminded us of topics ignored during the campaign , such as climate change			2
it has cast a spotlight on the need to have a strong enough government to handle huge , sudden challenges			0
and it has put an interesting twist on the idea of privatizing emergency disaster operations			2
we should keep in mind that much of what we see the candidates doing at this very moment amounts to political theater			1
as @entity214 voters see images and hear stories of death and destruction , of water gushing into subway tunnels , of ferocious winds toppling construction cranes , of homes burning , of hospital workers carrying critical patients down emergency stairs , and of brave efforts to recover , it 's crucial to remember this is an important moment , but it is not the only moment , not the only test to determine who should be the next president			1
because choosing the wrong president could prove an even greater disaster			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity297 .			0

@entity299 has seen disasters around the world change people 's vote
approval ratings soar or *plummet* depending on disaster performance , she says
@entity309 : both political camps are handling the aftermath of @entity79 with exact care
voters must keep in mind all the candidate stood for before disaster happened , she says
