-- @entity1 , whose initiative to forge peace in war - ravaged @entity4 failed to take hold , said he has resigned as the @entity8 and @entity9 joint special envoy because of " increasing militarization on the ground " and " the clear lack of unity " at the @entity14			1
@entity1 said he told @entity15 ban ki - moon and @entity9 secretary - general @entity16 that he did n't want to renew his mandate when it expires august 31			1
@entity4 state - run tv said the nation " expresses regret for the resignation , " and @entity15 said he and @entity16 are looking for a successor to take on the " crucial peacemaking effort			1
" in @entity24 , @entity1 said he accepted the job despite its challenges , a task that some had dubbed " @entity29			1
" he said it was a " sacred duty " to bring about peace , end the killings and abuse of civilians , and set a course toward political change			0
" the severity of the humanitarian costs of the conflict , and the exceptional threats posed by this crisis to international peace and security , justified the attempts to secure a peaceful transition to a political settlement , however daunting the challenge			0
the increasing militarization on the ground and the clear lack of unity in the @entity14 have fundamentally changed the circumstances for the effective exercise of my role , " he said			2
@entity56 authorized covert support for @entity4 rebels , sources say " yet the bloodshed continues , most of all because of the @entity4 government 's intransigence and continuing refusal to implement the six - point plan , and also because of the escalating military campaign of the opposition , all of which is compounded by the disunity of the international community			2
at a time when we need -- when the @entity4 people desperately need action , there continues to be finger - pointing and name - calling in the @entity14			1
" the nearly 17 - month - long @entity4 crisis started when the regime brutally cracked down on peaceful protesters in march 2011 and morphed into a nationwide uprising			0
among the five permanent members of the council , @entity81 and @entity82 have persistently disagreed with tough action against the regime of president @entity87 that is favored by the @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			2
the utter failure of world diplomacy and @entity4 leaders to end the fighting has resulted in a humanitarian catastrophe			0
opposition groups say that more than 20,000 people have died , thousands have been imprisoned by the regime and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes			0
@entity88 boost humanitarian aid to @entity4 the conflict is now internationally regarded as a civil war between an armed resistance movement and @entity87 's regime			1
" without serious , purposeful and united international pressure , including from the powers of the region , it is impossible for me , or anyone , to compel the @entity4 government in the first place , and also the opposition , to take the steps necessary to begin a political process			0
you have to understand : as an envoy , i ca n't want peace more than the protagonists , more than the @entity14 or the international community , for that matter , " @entity1 said			1
the appointment of the former secretary - general in february was supported by world powers and the @entity4 government			1
after he took the post , he helped formulate a six - point peace plan for @entity4 that included a cease - fire			0
the @entity8 established the @entity130 in @entity4 to monitor the efforts to forge the plan			2
the plan called for establishing a cease - fire between @entity87 's government and the opposition , allowing humanitarian groups access to the population , releasing detainees and starting a political dialogue			2
it also called for government forces to withdraw from city centers			0
despite an initial and small drop in violence after his plan was announced , fighting raged nonstop			0
the terrain became so dangerous in @entity4 that @entity8 monitors had to suspend their observation missions			2
in an opinion piece published thursday in the @entity153 , @entity1 said regional and international players have " clear common interests " in a " managed political transition			2
" he said @entity87 " must leave office			0
" read more : from rocks to @entity159 @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity167 , friends of the @entity4 regime , " must take concerted efforts to persuade @entity4 's leadership to change course and embrace a political transition , realizing the current government has lost all legitimacy , " he said			0
the @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity170 and @entity171 must press " the opposition to embrace a fully inclusive political process			2
" " none of this is possible , however , without genuine compromise on all sides , " he wrote			0
" @entity4 can still be saved from the worst calamity			0
but this requires courage and leadership , most of all from the permanent members of the @entity14 , including from presidents @entity182 and @entity56			2
is ours an international community that will act in defense of the most vulnerable of our world , and make the necessary sacrifices to help ? the coming weeks in @entity4 will tell			0
" the @entity1 initiative disappointed opposition groups			2
@entity190 , @entity191 - language spokeswoman for the opposition @entity193 , said @entity1 's replacement " will be equally constrained by @entity87 's failure to adhere to any sort of plan , and the ongoing complicity of @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity167 in mass killings and exodus in @entity4			1
" " the @entity1 resignation was expected , since his plans have failed			2
while this may cause discomfort for the @entity8 and prove that it was unable to provide a solution for the @entity4 people , it means nothing to the @entity4 people			0
the revolution will continue until we achieve our goals of freedom , democracy and dignity			0
" it is sad to watch the diplomatic process die in such indignity , but millions of @entity4 had indicated that @entity87 had no intention of implementing any diplomatic or political solution to the current crisis in @entity4 , " she said			0
" @entity1 's plan was fatally flawed for several reasons , chief among them that 300 unarmed observers under the near - constant supervision of regime monitors could not possibly have been effective in observing , enforcing or even reporting on a cease - fire , let alone the other tenets of the @entity232			1
" read more : @entity4 regime failed to protect civilians @entity235 , @entity81 ambassador to the @entity8 , said he hopes @entity1 uses the rest of the time on the job to be as effective as possible " under these very difficult circumstances			1
" " we understand that it is his decision			0
we regret that he chose to do so			0
we have supported very strongly @entity1 's efforts , " he said			1
" i 'm very encouraged that the secretary - general is already working on finding a successor for @entity1 who would be able to pick up this daunting task of putting an end to the crisis in @entity4			1
" ambassador @entity248 , the @entity88 ' permanent representative to the @entity8 , said @entity1 took on a " thankless and difficult task at great personal cost			1
" " when the @entity14 failed to heed mr. @entity1 's repeated calls for collective and significant consequences for non-compliance with its prior resolutions , those members who blocked this action effectively made mr. @entity1 's mission impossible , " she said in a written statement			1
@entity259 , the @entity260 's foreign policy chief , said @entity1 's resignation " makes clear how unfortunate it has been that the @entity14 was unable to agree to a resolution			1
" " the @entity260 continues to support the efforts of the @entity8 and the @entity9 and calls for the early appointment of a successor to carry on mr. @entity1 's work towards a peaceful political transition in @entity4 , " @entity264 said in a written statement			1
@entity15 , who was first to announce the move , praised @entity1 's " determined and courageous efforts " and said the news left him with " deep regret			1
" he said that @entity1 worked within the mandate provided to him by the @entity276 and that he is " indebted to him and his team for all they have tried to achieve			0
" but @entity15 also said the government and the opposition have been determined " to rely on ever - increasing violence , " and there have been " persistent divisions within the ( @entity8 ) @entity14			1
" " @entity1 deserves our profound admiration for the selfless way in which he has put his formidable skills and prestige to this most difficult and potentially thankless of assignments , " @entity15 said			1
@entity1 had been secretary - general from 1996 to 2006 and was involved in other initiatives , including the mediation of the election dispute a few years ago in @entity294			1
@entity15 said peace can come only if there 's a " firm commitment to dialogue " among the players in @entity4 and international unity			1
" tragically , the spiral of violence in @entity4 is continuing			0
the hand extended to turn away from violence in favor of dialogue and diplomacy -- as spelled out in the six - point plan -- has not been taken , even though it still remains the best hope for the people of @entity4			0
