he plays the only sport approved by the @entity2 , and @entity3 hopes the game he learned as a war refugee will play a big part in uniting his country			1
" now it 's very popular			2
the young generation really like cricket , supporting the @entity18 team , " he told @entity10 's human to hero series at the team 's training base in @entity14			1
" when we were children it was nothing			0
now in @entity18 we have big support			2
" it 's a country ravaged by war since the @entity28 invasion of 1979			1
following the @entity2 's subsequent harsh period of rule , which ended in a @entity33 - led intervention after the 9/11 terror attacks , @entity18 's government is now battling to forge its own path of democracy between the opposing forces of @entity39 expectation and fundamentalist @entity41 tradition			1
cricket , however , is being supported by @entity18 's opposing factions , says @entity44 , chief executive of the sport 's national association			1
" this is a game that can bring @entity18 together and be a very good tool for peace and stability , " he told @entity10 in a phone interview			1
" despite all these difficulties , the anti-government groups and armed groups hanging around , cricket has been progressing very well			0
" we have been receiving very good support , even from anti-government people as well , because we have been going frequently to the remote areas			0
" @entity42 has a very bright future here			0
the mountains cover 75 % of land in the country -- despite the fact land is very expensive , we have been offered a huge amount of land to build cricket grounds , in the north , the east and the west			0
" @entity71 has come a long way since his family had to flee @entity18 in the 1980s during the war with @entity75			1
" i was taught cricket in @entity77 , where there 's a lot of cricket in the street , in schools			1
we were a lot of guys , we played together , with a tennis ball , " he said of his upbringing in the border region of @entity85 -- once the gateway to some of @entity89 's richest trade routes , now a breeding ground for extremist elements			1
since then , not only has he had the chance to play for @entity18 in one - day and @entity97 internationals , he has also been appointed team captain			1
and the 28 - year - old is doing everything he can to achieve the country 's dream of being accepted at the top levels of cricket			1
" it 's a big pressure to take this challenge , as a captain , " @entity71 said			1
" it 's a big challenge to me to lead in the front , and perform well			0
that gives me more motivation			0
" @entity44 says that , in a country where 70 % of the population is under the age of 30 , it is important to not only target but also to educate young people in order to develop the sport			0
" that 's why we are going to be working with the @entity121 so that this game will be part of the sports period and will officially be taught in schools , " he said			2
" we do n't need only cricketers , we need educated cricketers			0
we are appointing coaches to go to the schools and train their teachers			0
so instead of taking boys to academies outside of schools , we are in fact taking cricket into their venues			0
" @entity71 's big break came when he was invited to spend three months at the home of @entity140 cricket , @entity141 , in 2007 as part of the young player program run by the @entity144 -- which governed the sport until the advent of the @entity147 in 1993			1
" it 's a beautiful ground , a beautiful academy , beautiful facilities			0
it 's a very interesting and moving experience for me , " he recalls			0
by that stage the @entity18 national team had been in existence for only six years , despite cricket having been played in the country as early as the 19th century by @entity158 soldiers			1
it rose quickly through the ranks of the minor nations -- those not accorded full status by the @entity147			0
in 2009 , the team finally won through to the final qualifying round for the @entity147 's 50 - over @entity167 tournament , scraping through after winning a rain - affected match against @entity169			1
" it was a very important match at that time			0
if we lose that match we did n't qualify , " @entity71 said			2
that was just a small step in @entity18 's journey to join cricket 's elite			1
the team has twice played at the @entity97 finals , but despite earning one - day international status , has yet to win a place at the @entity167 -- and hopes of becoming a full member @entity185 - playing nation are yet far away			1
" there is a lot of thirst for this game but it is difficult to persuade the international community to come and play some matches -- that will further develop and promote the game , " @entity44 said			2
outside of official tournaments , @entity18 does not play many matches -- which hinders its chances of moving up the rankings			2
it is 13th of the 50 - over nations , and 12th in @entity97			0
two victories over @entity202 last month kept alive @entity18 's hopes of qualifying for the @entity204 , but it will likely need to beat @entity205 and @entity206 in its remaining games to have a chance of claiming one of two places on offer for the tournament from the eight - nation @entity213			1
the other six teams will have another chance to qualify , with two more places up for grabs at a final eliminator in @entity219 next year			0
the full member nations automatically qualify			2
" it is disappointing that we are not receiving expected support from full member countries , apart from @entity77 , who is comparatively supporting us , " @entity44 said			2
" but we are not hopeless , we together with media can motivate these countries , especially @entity89 counties , who can provide @entity231 and @entity232 opportunities			0
" it is difficult to convey our message at @entity147 level because we are an affiliate member			0
hopefully this will change in the future , and we 're hoping the @entity147 will come and see how crazy people are for cricket			0
" for @entity71 , it would be a dream to lead out his national team on home soil at the highest level of cricket			1
at present , the @entity18 play their " home " internationals in @entity14 in the @entity248			2
" we are not playing in @entity18 , one - day internationals or @entity97 , " said @entity71 , who this year signed a contract to play in the @entity250			1
we have good supporters in @entity18			2
we want the @entity147 to allow some teams to @entity18			2
" that 's what we want , to become a test nation			0
