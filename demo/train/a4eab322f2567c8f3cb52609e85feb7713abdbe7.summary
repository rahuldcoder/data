the @entity0 riots 20 years ago this week were sparked by the acquittal of four @entity0 police officers in the brutal beating of suspect @entity4 a year earlier			1
the turbulence that led to more than 50 deaths and $ 1 billion in property damage all began with a traffic violation			2
a poor decision to drink and drive led to a 100 - mph car chase and a chain of events that would forever change @entity0 , its police department and the racial conversation in the @entity16			1
@entity4 , then a 25 - year - old convicted robber on parole , admittedly had a few drinks under his belt as he headed home from a friend 's house			1
when he spotted a police car following him , he panicked , thinking he would be sent back to prison			2
@entity4 : what happened in 1991 " i had a job to go to that monday , and i knew i was on parole , and i knew i was n't supposed to be drinking , and i 'm like , ' @entity30 , ' " @entity4 told @entity27 last year			1
realizing he could n't outrun police but fearing what they might do to him when they caught him , @entity4 said he looked for a public place to stop			1
" i saw all those apartments over there , so i said , ' i 'm gon na stop right there			2
if it goes down , somebody will see it			2
' " it did go down			2
four police officers , all of them white , struck @entity4 more than 50 times with their wooden batons and shocked him with an electric stun gun			1
" ' we are going to kill you , n * * * * r , ' " @entity4 said police shouted as they beat him			1
the officers denied using racial slurs			1
@entity4 was right in his expectation of a beating , but his hope of having a witness was fulfilled in a big way			1
not only did somebody see it , somebody videotaped it -- still a novelty in 1991 , before people had cellphone cameras			2
the video showed a large lump of a man floundering on the ground , surrounded by a dozen or more police officers , four of whom were beating him relentlessly with nightsticks			1
one officer 's swings slow down as he appears worn out by his nonstop flailing			2
@entity4 was beaten nearly to death			1
three surgeons operated on him for five hours that morning			2
the dramatic video of the episode appeared on national tv two days later			2
at last , blacks in @entity0 -- and no doubt in other parts of the country -- had evidence to document the police brutality many @entity16 had known about but had denied or tolerated			1
overheard on @entity27 : @entity4 ' had demons			1
but called them his own ' " we finally caught the @entity89 with a camcorder , " @entity4 attorney @entity87 said			1
four @entity92 officers -- @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and sgt. @entity96 -- were indicted on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and excessive use of force by a police officer			1
in april 1992 , after a three - month trial in the predominantly white suburb of @entity105 , three of the officers were acquitted of all charges			2
but the jury , which had no black members , was deadlocked on one charge of excessive force against @entity94			0
a mistrial was declared on that charge			0
@entity94 's attorney , @entity114 , said the unedited video worked against @entity4 and helped prove the officers ' case			1
" most of the nation only saw a few snippets where it 's the most violent			0
they did n't see him get up and run at @entity94 , " @entity114 said			0
" in a use - of - force case , if the officers do what they 're trained to do , how can you find them guilty of a crime ? and the jury understood that			2
" still , black @entity0 exploded in outrage			1
rioters rampaged through the streets , looting businesses , torching buildings and attacking people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time			0
on the third day of rioting , @entity4 emerged from seclusion to make a plea that echoes to this day : " people , i just want to say , can we all get along ? " he said			1
" can we get along ? " the rioting ended , but the divisions and debate did not			0
nearly a year later , the four officers were tried in federal court on civil rights charges			2
this trial would be very different from the first : it took place in @entity0 , two african - americans were picked for the jury and @entity4 actually testified this time			1
" there was no way in the world that any jury would acquit all of the defendants again , " @entity114 , the defense attorney , told @entity27			0
@entity4 's own testimony may have hurt the federal case , as he hedged on whether police had used racial slurs during the beating			1
@entity4 told @entity27 in 2011 that slurs definitely were uttered , but he said he vacillated on the stand because his mother had advised him to avoid talking about race			1
ultimately , @entity96 and @entity94 were found guilty , while @entity93 and @entity168 were acquitted			0
" it was like ... i just hope we just get one			0
i hope we just get one on that , " @entity4 said			1
" if we get one , we 're good			0
so to get the two , i was really happy			0
" " we got half - justice , " his attorney , @entity87 , growled , but the verdicts and the 30 - month sentences seemed to satisfy the community			0
one more trial awaited : @entity4 's lawsuit against the city of @entity0			1
this time , there was only one @entity185 on the jury , and she was a force to be reckoned with			0
" half of them had no sympathy whatsoever , " @entity188 told @entity27 , referring to her fellow jurors			0
" they did not care at all			0
they just did n't care			0
like , ' he broke the law			2
he deserved what he got			0
' " " i told them they were crazy ! " she recalled			0
" it was about justice for what happened to him			0
no one deserves to get beat like that			2
" eventually , the other jurors came around , and @entity4 was awarded $ 3.8 million in damages			1
but the aftereffects continue to this day			0
@entity4 sometimes still wears a protective vest in response to a fear of reprisal and some genuine threats			1
and he 's had several more run - ins with the law , including a 90 - day jail stint in 1996 for a hit - and - run involving his wife at the time			0
last year , on the 20th anniversary of the beating , @entity4 was pulled over without incident and ticketed for a minor traffic violation			1
later in the summer , he was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving			0
he pleaded guilty in february to a misdemeanor reckless driving charge in connection to that arrest			0
he was fined $ 500 , given 20 days ' home detention , placed on probation for three years and ordered into a nine - month sobriety education program			1
people have long wondered why @entity4 kept getting into trouble			1
" the trouble that they see me in is a part of my life that i 'm working on , " he told @entity27 last year			0
in 2008 , he appeared on the @entity239 reality show " @entity240			0
" " i 'll always have an issue when it comes to alcohol			0
my dad was an alcoholic , the addiction part is in my blood , " he told @entity27			0
" what i 've learned to do is to arrest my addiction			0
arrest it myself , so i do n't get arrested			0
" things have changed at the @entity92 in the past 20 years			1
the upper ranks are much more diverse			0
changes also have been made -- sometimes under court order -- in the way certain neighborhoods are patrolled and in how complaints are handled			0
" the main impact that the @entity4 case had is that it accelerated change , " journalist @entity257 said			1
" it 's not tenable any longer in the @entity16 for a police force of a major city to govern without having the community being a part of that governance			0
" @entity4 has just released a memoir , " the riot within , " in which he describes his difficult upbringing and reflects on the beating and its aftermath			1
in an interview this week on @entity27 , @entity4 said he has forgiven the officers who beat him nearly to death			1
" yes , i 've forgiven them , because i 've been forgiven many times , " he said			2
" my country 's been good to me , and i 've done some things that was n't pleasant in my lifetime and i have been forgiven for that			2
" ... it 's like something happening bad in my own house , " he continued			0
" this country is my house , it 's the only home i know , so i have to be able to forgive -- for the future , for the younger generation coming behind me , so ... they can understand and if a situation like that happened again they could deal with it a lot easier			0
