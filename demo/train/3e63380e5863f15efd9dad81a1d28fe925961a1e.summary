@entity0 -- @entity2 says he has n't made up his mind yet on a 2016 presidential campaign , but that did n't stop him wednesday from taking a thinly veiled shot at the top contender for the @entity9 nomination			2
@entity2 , the former governor of @entity10 , did n't mention former secretary of state @entity11 by name , but @entity14 was clearly the butt of his remarks in @entity17 : " this last week i saw something that was breathtaking			1
a candidate , a former secretary of state , who was campaigning in @entity21 where she said that ' do n't let them tell you that businesses creates jobs , ' " @entity2 said , referring to a line @entity14 made last week			1
while campaigning in @entity21 friday , @entity14 told the crowd , " do n't let anybody tell you that it 's corporations and businesses that create jobs , " adding that trickle - down economic policies have " failed rather spectacularly			1
" @entity14 backpedaled on those remarks three days later explaining that " our economy grows when businesses and entrepreneurs create good - paying jobs here in @entity39 where workers and families are empowered to build from the bottom up and the middle out " instead of handing " tax breaks to corporations that outsource jobs			1
" @entity46 have since pounced on the remarks and the former @entity10 governor also used @entity14 's line to build on his own economic vision			2
" well , the problem in @entity39 today is that not enough jobs are being created			0
they are created by businesses where people 's income rise where they can live a life of purpose and meaning independent of government			0
that should be the mission			0
and the only way that we do that is to create a climate of high sustained economic growth where everybody , everybody in this country has a chance at earned success , " @entity2 said			1
and while that might sound like a stump speech , @entity2 insists he has n't made up his mind yet , though he is seriously considering a bid and has met with top donors			0
his son @entity78 even said it 's " more than likely that he 's giving this a serious thought in moving forward " last weekend			0
his father is expected to make a decision after the holiday season			0
the former governor is n't the only potential @entity46 presidential candidate who knocked @entity14 this week over the jobs comments			2
sen. @entity88 of @entity89 slammed @entity14 earlier this week while campaigning for @entity46 candidates in @entity91			1
" @entity11 comes up and she says , ' businesses do n't create jobs			1
' anybody here think businesses do n't create jobs ? " @entity88 said , according to @entity98			1
" i 'm here today to endorse @entity99 and @entity100 , because you know what ? they know that businesses do create jobs , and i hope you know that too			2
" @entity88 also used his time at the mic to tie @entity14 's comments to a comment from president @entity111 on the 2012 campaign trail that was used repeatedly by @entity46 to attack the president during his reelection bid			2
" the president says , ' you did n't build that , it just sort of happened , ' " @entity88 said			0
@entity111 's comment that " if you 've got a business , you did n't build that " during a campaign rally in 2012 came while @entity111 was talking about the importance of infrastructure and public services			0
the remark caused the @entity111 campaign quite a headache in 2012 , and it looks like @entity14 's comments on jobs could have the same impact in 2016 , if she were to run .			0

while campaigning in @entity17 , @entity2 hit @entity14 over her comments that businesses do n't create jobs
@entity14 later *walked* back those remarks saying tax breaks for corporations do n't spur economic growth
but that has n't stopped @entity2 and sen. @entity88 from hitting @entity14 over the quote
