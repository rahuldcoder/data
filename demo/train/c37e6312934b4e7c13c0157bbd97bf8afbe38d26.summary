-- @entity2 marine experts have laid their hands on an octopus that 's missing two of its own : a six - limbed creature that they have dubbed ' hexapus			1
' @entity8 the ' hexapus ' photographed by staff at @entity11 's @entity10 , in northwest @entity2			1
ordinarily , octopodes have eight arms and legs			2
and should they lose one or more in an accident , they can grow the limbs back			2
which is what makes ' @entity8 ' -- as staffers at @entity22 in northwest @entity2 have dubbed their find -- so unique			2
his missing limbs stem from a birth defect			1
" if you look closer between the legs , there 's webbing that attaches each of the arms together , " @entity26 of the @entity10 told @entity0 tuesday			2
" you 'd assume if he 'd lost one of his legs in an accident , there would be space for an arm to grow back			1
" but there 's no space for two extra legs to grow back			1
that 's just how he is			0
" staffers called others zoos and aquariums and scoured the @entity48 to see if there were records of similar creatures			0
" no one has ever heard of another case of a six - legged octopus , " said display superviser @entity52			1
' @entity8 ' was picked up from a local zoo along with seven other octopodes for a new exhibit at the center			0
no one noticed his missing legs until he attached himself to the inside of his glass tank			0
they named him ' @entity8 ' because it alliterated well with ' hexapus			0
' " it has also been mentioned in the grapevine that he was named after @entity8 who had six wives when he should have had eight , " @entity26 , the centre 's marketing director , said			0
until @entity8 , the most famous six - legged octopus was one that appeared in a 1955 b - movie , ' @entity75			1
' as was common of many science fiction movies of the era , the film was made on a shoestring budget -- and designers left off two legs from the creature because of budget contraints			0
octopuses are renowned for having three hearts , blue blood and the ability to alter their skin complexion in the blink of an eye			0
but , said the center , " ( e ) ven these astonishing characteristics however are commonplace compared to @entity8 's unique tally in the leg department			1
