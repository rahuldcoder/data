-- it may have been a simple misunderstanding that led to a horrific lynching			1
on october 5 , four @entity4 students , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , and @entity8 left campus for the village of @entity11			1
according to @entity5 's mother @entity12 , @entity6 was owed some money and he asked his three classmates to accompany him to the village to collect on the debt			1
within minutes of their arrival , a rumor spread that the students were not there to collect but to steal			1
an enraged mob stripped them naked while beating them with sticks and rocks then wrapped car tires around their necks -- a form of torture known as " necklacing			1
" as the four men sat on the muddy ground dazed and pleading for their lives , someone doused them with gasoline , lit a match and set them on fire			0
more : @entity39 demand justice over brutal murders the killing of the " @entity43 four " was filmed and posted on the web for the world to see and now serves as a stark reminder of what can happen when the rule of law fails and communities turn to vigilante groups to carry out summary executions of criminal suspects , said @entity53 , @entity54 researcher at @entity55			1
" @entity59 justice and mob justice generally takes place when there is a culture of impunity for crimes and in @entity54 , the @entity54 authorities have failed to crack down on this culture of impunity , " @entity53 told @entity0			1
mob justice is not unique to @entity54 and it would be unfair to characterize it as such			1
one infamous lynching in particular shocked the world and helped to spark the civil rights movement in the @entity72			1
in august 1955 , 14 - year - old @entity73 was beaten , his eyes gouged and shot in the head			0
his body was then thrown in the @entity77 with a 70 - pound cotton gin tied around his neck with barbed wire			0
his crime ? allegedly whistling at a white woman			1
@entity73 's mother insisted on a public funeral service with an open casket showing the horribly mutilated and bloated body of her child so that the world would see the brutality of the lynching			2
@entity5 's mother felt the same way when @entity0 approached her to talk about her son 's killing			2
" i want the world to know how our security failed us			0
i want the world to know that my son and his three friends are innocent of what they said they did , " @entity5 said			0
according to news reports , the village of @entity11 was on edge after several incidences of armed robbery -- and in a country where critics say corrupt police are sometimes considered more dangerous than criminals , mob justice is how many disputes ranging from pick - pocketing to kidnapping are often resolved			1
but @entity116 says her son and his friends were just innocent kids			0
" he was a very kind hearted boy and we ( were ) so close , " she said			0
" if my son sees you 100 times he will greet you 110 times			0
" @entity5 says the boys also had promising futures in music			0
they had already recorded a song together called " @entity129 " -- a title she now says seems eerily like a premonition of what came to pass			0
" it 's almost as if they knew they were going to die , " @entity5 said			2
@entity5 and her husband , @entity137 , an oil executive at @entity138 ( @entity138 ) , says that he watched the video because he would n't have believed it if he had n't seen his son 's killing with his own eyes			2
" i want them to know from beginning to end the barbaric nature with which they chose hunt them down , " he said			0
" even your worse enemy should not be treated in such form in the 21st century that people are still behaving and killing human beings as if they were rats			0
" the @entity54 police have arrested 13 people and , shockingly , one police officer who was on the scene and may have encouraged and even participated in the killing			1
while that officer is awaiting trial , the @entity54 police force has denied broader charges of rampant corruption and abuse			1
spokesman @entity165 says while @entity54 's police is not perfect , the police " are committed to improving our competency through training and retraining and to improve our service , deliver to protect law and order and to stabilize democracy in @entity175 's largest country			1
" @entity53 says it is not enough			0
he told @entity0 : " generally if you are the victim of a crime and you go to the police , you are asked to fund the criminal investigation			2
if you do n't have the money to fund it and meet the incessant bribe to the police the case is often dropped			2
on the other hand , the criminal suspect , if he or she has the financial means , can simply pay off the police			2
" this is why these extrajudicial executions are still all too common across @entity54			1
it is impossible to find official statistics , but a quick search of the words in @entity199 pulls up dozens of clips showing what happens to someone accused of crime when a mob sets themselves up as judge and jury			2
this incident however , has seemingly galvanized the public			0
there are petitions and websites springing up to raise awareness of the issue and to pressure government and police officials			2
but many also say there are already laws against assault and murder which , when it comes down to it , is what mob justice is all about			1
for things to change , they say , the culture has to change			0
@entity229 believes her son is now a martyr , and hopes that his lynching will lead to change -- much in the way that @entity73 's killing did			0
" if justice is done , then i will be happy , " she said			0
" because i know my son died a hero			0
he paid the price for @entity54 students in generations to come			1
" at least 11 killed in suicide attacks on church at @entity54 military base			1

@entity244 may have led to four @entity54 students being killed by mob
" mob justice " is reportedly how many disputes are resolved in @entity175 's most *populous* country
