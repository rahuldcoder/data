" ( for ) people who were down there , the most important thing for them was recovering people , even when they knew there were no survivors , " @entity86 said			0
when an official was sent to pick up the flag a week or so later , he apparently received a larger flag , and it was flown at subsequent events			2
" they had no reason to believe it was n't the flag , " @entity86 said			2
the story of the missing flag includes a larger , more philosophical question : is it the actual flag that is most important -- or the ideals it represents ? for its part , the @entity20 flag photo -- taken by @entity113 of the @entity115 newspaper in @entity116 , @entity117 -- quickly became a symbol			1
it was plastered on the cover of @entity122 , with the words , " @entity128 , " and the image could be seen on everything from coffee cups to tattoos			0

among those interviewed were the couple who owned the yacht from which the flag was taken by a firefighter to hang at the @entity20 site			1
they wanted to donate the flag to the @entity154 and asked about a year after the attacks to borrow the signed flag briefly for a ceremony			2
" when we got the flag , we were quite stunned that it was the wrong flag , " said @entity158			2
" ... this wraps around the two of us , and we 're not the thinnest people on @entity165 ... so we knew right away it was the wrong flag			2
" learn more than you ever knew about " @entity51 " does it matter whether it was the real flag ? woven throughout the film , which is based on a book by @entity171 , are discussions about the powerful nature of a flag			1
" we 're not a country based on religion or ethnicity , or even cultural heritage " @entity27 told the filmmakers			0
" we 're a country based on ideas and a philosophy			0
and that 's what the flag is			2
" @entity186 , who works for @entity187 , said a flag " makes you feel that we are bigger than just ourselves			2
" a young crew member of the @entity67 wiped away tears as she described having the supposed @entity20 flag on board			1
" it just makes what you 're doing so much more , wow , meaningful , " she said			0
when asked whether it mattered whether the flag was recovered , a visitor to the 9/11 memorial said , " it would matter			2
it would matter to me			0
" another said , " i think it would to the families who lost their loved ones			0
" among those who died were 343 firefighters			0
@entity208 , a retired detective with the @entity209 , said he would rather not know what became of the @entity20 flag			1
" if you had the actual flag ... the cynic in me ( would say ) , people want it			2
you put a price on it			0
... then it becomes something else			0
" @entity86 got a firsthand taste of a flag 's power while making " @entity225 " with @entity87			0
released in 2004 , the documentary tells the story of a group of @entity13 soldiers who fought in @entity230			1
the @entity232 insurgency was growing , and @entity86 , an @entity13 , wanted to leave in spring 2004 for his home , then in @entity234			1
he stayed at a @entity13 facility at the airport and awoke to find a small folded @entity13 flag under his pillow , a customary gift made by some group			1
" i was so overwhelmed with emotion			0
that flag means home , " @entity86 said			0
" while that experience is not uniquely @entity13 , when you are thousands of miles from home , under stress , and you see the colors -- it reminds you of your people			1
" the flag : what makes an image unforgettable ?			0

@entity52 production looks at flag raised at @entity20
