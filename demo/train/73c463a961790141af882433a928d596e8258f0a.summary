-- a six - page rant to @entity3 's sir @entity2 about a woeful in - flight meal attracted so much attention on the internet that it was rumored to be a clever marketing stunt			1
image one : " look at this @entity2			1
" the author was reported to be @entity11 , a 29 year old art director who works at a @entity13 advertising agency			1
both he and @entity3 have insisted the letter , described as possibly " the world 's best passenger complaint , " is authentic			1
here 's what @entity11 had to say after a flight he described as a " culinary journey of hell			1
" the letter dear mr @entity2 @entity24 : @entity25 to @entity26 7th december 2008 i love the @entity3 brand , i really do which is why i continue to use it despite a series of unfortunate incidents over the last few years			1
this latest incident takes the biscuit			1
ironically , by the end of the flight i would have gladly paid over a thousand rupees for a single biscuit following the culinary journey of hell i was subjected to at the hands of your corporation			1
just look at it : [ see image one , above ]			1
i imagine the same questions are racing through your brilliant mind as were racing through mine on that fateful day			1
what is this ? why have i been given it ? what have i done to deserve this ? and , which one is the starter , which one is the dessert ? you do n't get to a position like yours @entity2 with anything less than a generous sprinkling of observational power so i know you will have spotted the tomato next to the two yellow shafts of sponge on the left			1
yes , it 's next to the sponge shaft without the green paste			1
that 's got to be the clue has n't it			1
no sane person would serve a dessert with a tomato would they			1
well answer me this @entity2 , what sort of animal would serve a dessert with peas in : [ see image two , above ]			1
i know it looks like a baaji but it 's in custard @entity2 , custard			1
it must be the pudding			1
well you 'll be fascinated to hear that it was n't custard			1
it was a sour gel with a clear oil on top			1
it 's only redeeming feature was that it managed to be so alien to my palette that it took away the taste of the curry emanating from our miscellaneous central cuboid of beige matter			1
perhaps the meal on the left might be the dessert after all			1
anyway , this is all irrelevant at the moment			2
i was raised strictly but neatly by my parents and if they knew i had started dessert before the main course , a sponge shaft would be the least of my worries			2
so let 's peel back the tin - foil on the main dish and see what 's on offer			2
i 'll try and explain how this felt			2
imagine being a twelve year old boy @entity2			1
now imagine it 's @entity121 morning and you 're sat their with your final present to open			2
it 's a big one , and you know what it is			2
it 's that @entity130 stereo you picked out the catalogue and wrote to @entity132 about			2
only you open the present and it 's not in there			2
it 's your hamster @entity2			1
it 's your hamster in the box and it 's not breathing			2
that 's how i felt when i peeled back the foil and saw this : [ see image three , above ]			2
now i know what you 're thinking			2
you 're thinking it 's more of that @entity147 custard			2
i admit i thought the same too , but no. it 's mustard @entity2			1
more mustard than any man could consume in a month			1
on the left we have a piece of broccoli and some peppers in a brown glue - like oil and on the right the chef had prepared some mashed potato			2
the potato masher had obviously broken and so it was decided the next best thing would be to pass the potatoes through the digestive tract of a bird			2
once it was regurgitated it was clearly then blended and mixed with a bit of mustard			1
everybody likes a bit of mustard @entity2			1
by now i was actually starting to feel a little hypoglycaemic			2
i needed a sugar hit			0
luckily there was a small cookie provided			0
it had caught my eye earlier due to its baffling presentation : [ see image four , above ]			0
it appears to be in an evidence bag from the scene of a crime			0
a crime against bloody cooking			0
either that or some sort of back - street underground cookie , purchased off a gun - toting maniac high on his own supply of yeast			0
you certainly would n't want to be caught carrying one of these through customs			0
imagine biting into a piece of brass @entity2			1
that would be softer on the teeth than the specimen above			0
all i wanted to do was relax but obviously i had to sit with that mess in front of me for half an hour			0
i swear the sponge shafts moved at one point			0
once cleared , i decided to relax with a bit of your world - famous onboard entertainment			0
i switched it on : [ see image five , above ]			0
i apologise for the quality of the photo , it 's just it was incredibly hard to capture @entity217 's face through the flickering white lines running up and down the screen			0
perhaps it would be better on another channel : [ see image six , above ]			0
is that @entity223 ? a question i found myself asking over and over again throughout the gruelling half - hour i attempted to watch the film like this			0
after that i switched off			0
i was the hungriest i 'd been in my adult life and i had a splitting headache from squinting at a crackling screen			0
my only option was to simply stare at the seat in front and wait for either food , or sleep			0
neither came for an incredibly long time			0
but when it did it surpassed my wildest expectations : [ see image seven , above ]			0
yes ! it 's another crime - scene cookie			0
only this time you dunk it in the white stuff			0
what is that white stuff ? it looked like it was going to be yoghurt			0
it finally dawned on me what it was after staring at it			0
it was a mixture between the @entity147 custard and the @entity253 sauce			0
it reminded me of my first week at university			0
i had overheard that you could make a drink by mixing vodka and refreshers			0
i lied to my new friends and told them i 'd done it loads of times			0
when i attempted to make the drink in a big bowl it formed a cheese @entity2 , a cheese			1
that cheese looked a lot like your baaji - mustard			1
so that was that @entity2			1
i did n't eat a bloody thing			0
my only question is : how can you live like this ? i ca n't imagine what dinner round your house is like , it must be like something out of a nature documentary			0
as i said at the start i love your brand , i really do			0
it 's just a shame such a simple thing could bring it crashing to it 's knees and begging for sustenance			0
