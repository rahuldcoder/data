-- an elk 's close encounter with a photographer prompted @entity5 officials to euthanize the animal			2
the video of the young bull elk nudging and head - butting @entity10 , who was sitting on a @entity13 roadside , spread quickly through @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 last week			1
while most people saw a fascinating exchange between human and beast , wildlife biologists saw danger			0
" by initiating physical contact with a visitor , the elk displayed an unacceptable risk to human safety , " a park statement released monday said			1
humans visiting the @entity32 area of the national park had apparently been feeding the young bull elk , which then " lost his instinctive fear of humans , " officials said			1
" after becoming food conditioned , the elk did not respond to any attempts to keep it out of the area and away from humans , " they said			0
" when wildlife exhibits this behavior it often escalates to more aggressive behavior creating a dangerous situation for visitors			0
" the animal had a history of " approaching visitors seeking handouts , " they said			1
wildlife biologists " made the difficult decision to euthanize an elk " last friday			0
park officials knew of this elk 's familiarity with humans before the video racked up millions of views online			1
" between september and last week , park biologists aggressively hazed this elk 28 times to discourage it from approaching the road and visitors , " they said			1
" they captured , sedated , tagged , and re-released it on site			0
" " the behavior that it learned from park visitors who had given it food had been too strongly ingrained , " making it unlikely the elk would change his offensive ways , they said			0
@entity10 , who hunched over and and remained still through much of the encounter , was not injured , but " if the animal had approached a child instead of an adult , the outcome for the visitor could have been very different , " park officials said			2
this elk was the first euthanized in the park since the animals were reintroduced there by park officials 13 years ago , the release said			2
@entity93 once were populous in the area but were gone from the region by the mid- 1800s due to over-hunting and loss of habitat , according to the national park 's website			2
