@entity1 , @entity0 -- from " gladiator " to " @entity9 " , " @entity10 " to " @entity11 , " film composer @entity3 's versatile and imaginative scores have added aural color , light and shade to the on - screen action			1
composer @entity3 , interviewed by @entity2 's @entity13 nominated for an @entity16 seven times ( he won for 1995 's " @entity9 " ) , @entity14 had just two weeks of formal music lessons as a child			1
he worked as an assistant to film composer @entity20 in @entity1 where he learnt " how to wrestle an orchestra to the ground " while making the coffee			2
that led to a job with @entity20 on @entity28 's epic " @entity26 " -- and the rest is film history			1
@entity2 's @entity31 talked to him about the magic that music can bring to the movies			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... @entity2 : what is the reality behind the glamour of working as a film composer ? @entity3 : it 's an industry that relies so heavily on the idea that i will wake up tomorrow morning with a great tune in my head			1
this usually does n't happen , so it 's a whole industry based on the fallacy that we , the filmmakers , will actually come up with some good ideas and meet our deadlines , when really we sit in our rooms by ourselves and knock our heads against the wall until something happens			1
most of my ideas are terrible and occasionally there 's a glimmer of hope and a decent tune comes out ; but to make a movie you have to rely very heavily on the creative input of everyone else			1
i love speaking with the editors , hanging out with the director and whoever			2
the movie shapes itself through these conversations			1
@entity2 : which comes first , the music or the film ? @entity74 : it changes all the time			1
you grab a fragment of something to start an idea with ; tiny ideas			0
it 's a complete hodgepodge of ways of sneaking up on the beast			1
for instance , on " @entity10 3 , " a lot of the music was written while @entity87 was shooting or before he went off shooting the movie			1
finally , i moved the whole studio to @entity92 's cutting rooms because being in the same space as the movie makes a difference and part of what i should do is try to inspire the production			1
with " @entity11 , " i thought , " hang on a second , they 've been around for years but none of the characters have any themes really			0
" so i was just noodling around			0
i try to understand my characters			0
why are they like this ? and why would i find it even remotely compelling to watch a story about a weird character like this and what 's funny about it ? and after all this semi-intelligent talk it really comes down to flailing around and hoping that some of those notes make sense and that they can tell a story			1
@entity2 : your score for " @entity121 " really stands out			1
what inspired you on this film ? @entity74 : it started off with @entity125 phoning me			0
he goes , " i 'm going to be shooting this big battle scene south of @entity1			0
why do n't you come over and we 'll have a chat ? " and i 'm driving through this wood and i get to a dirt track ; and it 's a miserable day , only the way @entity0 in november can be			1
suddenly i 'm in this @entity135 encampment with these beautiful tents and in the background there are guys just killing each other with swords in the mud			0
it 's a big battle scene and it 's grubby as hell , but @entity125 and i are having this meeting in the @entity148 tent set and he 's got this beautiful bed in there with a mink throw on top of it and it 's all purple and red and silk and there are all these amazing marble busts			1
i started thinking about antiquity and about going to @entity160 and seeing these fantastic artifacts which enrich our life nowadays , and how it was really all built on the blood and sweat of slaves			0
and i thought , " how benign , how wonderful			0
we see these sculptures and we forget how people have suffered for this			0
" i thought , " i want to find the most benign , banal music and sort of savage it up and make it our battle music			1
" i thought of @entity176 waltzes			1
so all the battles are scored with these @entity176 waltzes			1
@entity2 : is your relationship with the director the key to getting the score perfect ? @entity74 : yes , there has to be an element of friendship and trust and at the same time an element of give and take			1
a director can be in control on pretty much everything : he can rewrite lines in the script ; he can act a little for the actors ; he can look into the camera and adjust all that			0
but when it comes to music , it 's tricky territory : what 's he going to say to me ? c major to f major ? that would be good here ? it 's meaningless , so the conversation becomes different			1
you want to take their vision , whatever it is , beyond what he had			0
@entity2 : how do you find sounds ? @entity74 : i go there			0
with @entity125 's " @entity215 , " i sent @entity216 , who 's now composing @entity125 's new film , out into the desert to these villages to see what they play			1
i told him , " see if you can buy any instruments or record some of the stuff			0
" @entity216 came back with a plethora of weird instruments which we then had to wonder , ' do you blow into this or do you hit it ? ' i 've spent a lot of time going to @entity232 and recording indigenous instruments or choirs or whatever			0
anything can become a musical sound			0
the wind on telegraph wires is a great sound ; get it into your machine and play it and it becomes interesting			2
@entity2 : describe the moment of playing your first musical sketches to a director			0
you ca n't defend it and it 's very simple : however it lands , this thing that you have slaved over , if it does n't resonate ; if it does n't communicate , you got ta start again			2
it 's -- i 'm hedging around having to say the sentence because it sounds pretentious -- you write stuff from your heart			2
when you play anything for anybody for the first time it 's terrifying because you 're letting them having a look at a very vulnerable part of you			2
@entity2 : you have to be such a chameleon as a composer			0
@entity74 : i love ducking and diving			0
i did " @entity268 " and " @entity269 " in the same month			0
i finished " pirates , " had one day off and got into " @entity11 " and it 's a very different language			2
and i think that 's what keeps it interesting ; certainly for me			2
@entity2 : tell us a bit about the relationship between a movie score composer and a songwriter , for example @entity280 in " @entity9			1
" @entity74 : this was pretty early on in my career			0
i 'm a huge @entity280 fan and always was			0
@entity280 had done these piano demos			0
i took the first one , ' @entity286 , ' and made up my mind there were two ways i could approach it : i could either be really respectful of @entity280 's notes and what he had done , and very slavishly try to orchestrate it , or i could try to make it my own , usurp it , throw my stuff at it and go crazy , which is pretty much what i did			2
then they had to show it to @entity280 and i 'm sitting next to him , pretty nervous -- and on the cd you get @entity280 's version and my version and you can see how radically different they are -- and the great thing about him is he 's so secure in his artistry as a songwriter that he loved it			1
and it was the beginning of a very good friendship			0
@entity2 : are there particular challenges working on animated films as opposed to live action films ? @entity74 : with animated film you have to create the sonic world ; there 's nothing there			2
you get to color things in more and you 're allowed to overreach yourself a little bit more and it 's great fun			1
@entity2 : you 've also mentored a number of others			0
why is that important for you ? @entity74 : when i first started working here i noticed there was the a-list and then no one else got to work , and the a-list was pretty small			0
the other thing that really bugged me was that people who had an enormous amount of talent did n't get to do these movies ' cause they could n't get hold of the technology			0
and i thought ' hey i have a studio ' and these are my friends			0
so i let them have access to the tools and let people hear their music ; simple as that			2
@entity2 : when do you think a score works best as opposed to a soundtrack of pre-existing songs ? @entity74 : it depends			2
" @entity361 " must be the best use of songs ever in a movie ; it adds a layer to the movie you would n't ever get from a score			1
" @entity362 , " " @entity363 , " " @entity364 " -- i ca n't imagine those movies would have worked as well with just a bunch of songs put into them			0
it does n't matter how good they are			0
a score usually does n't -- a score is strictly for that moment in time			2
@entity2 : what distinguishes a great score from a good score ? @entity74 : there are very few great scores			1
i can think of a handful : " @entity395 , " @entity387 's score for " @entity388 , " " @entity389 , " @entity391 's score ; just using one song and creating a whole world out of it			1
" the movie and the score are truly one and it gives you an incredibly complete experience			1
they are of a musical quality ; they transcend background music			2
they have a point of view , they have a great tune attached to them and incredible craftsmanship			2

@entity3 's scores *include* " @entity9 " and " @entity414 "
@entity14 *contrasted* bloody battles with @entity176 waltzes in " gladiator "
@entity14 says a great score is when " the music and the movie are truly one "
