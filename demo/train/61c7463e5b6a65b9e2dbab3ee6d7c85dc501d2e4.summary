one of the victims was also identified			1

" we heard from so many people who want to help , as well as from people who fear their loved ones may have been among the women abused			0

" there are still two more suspects whose images have been shared who have not yet been identified , as well as ... other suspects			1

i had to turn it in and i pray that you find these ( expletives ) in the video 's molesting handicap people , " the letter continues			0
