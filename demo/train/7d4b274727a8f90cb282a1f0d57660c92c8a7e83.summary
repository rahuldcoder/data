-- amid concerns over adult content popping up on its new vine video app , @entity1 appeared tuesday to have restricted how users can share sexually explicit clips			1
as with @entity1 , @entity8 users can create and search hashtags ( # @entity0 , # news , # tech , for instance ) to share posts with a wider audience or find lots of content about the same subject			1
by tuesday morning , hashtags that had worked monday -- including searches for the terms " porn , " " nude , " " sex " and " naked " -- were among those that delivered no results			1
that does n't mean that pornographic content has disappeared from the @entity8 app. but it 's no longer as easy to find , or share , huge caches of the stuff with a single click			0
@entity1 did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story			0
rolled out last thursday , @entity8 is a mobile app that lets users create six - second video clips and share them through the app , on @entity1 , or both			1
while @entity8 has already been used to post some creative videos , like virtually any web tool that allows user - created content it has also been used for the mass display of naughty bits			0
the issue came to the forefront over the weekend when an explicit video appeared under the prominently displayed " @entity52 " section on the app 's main page			2
@entity1 said the video appeared due to an employee 's error and it was removed			2
the porn issue was a public - relations stumble for @entity1 and for what appears to be a quickly adopted app. since its release , @entity8 has been among the most popular free apps in @entity62 's app store			1
currently , @entity8 is only available on @entity62 mobile devices			0
with its restrictions , @entity8 's new model appears to more closely resemble the one used on @entity67 - owned @entity66 , the popular photo - sharing app. salacious hashtags also deliver no results there			2
on tuesday , there were still some workaround - style hashtags on @entity8 with which users were sharing adult videos			0
presumably , @entity1 might monitor and start deleting those as well .			0

naughty hashtags are no longer working on @entity1 's vine video app
users had begun using the app 's 6 - second clips to post porn
on tuesday , # porn , # sex , # nude and # naked no longer delivered results
