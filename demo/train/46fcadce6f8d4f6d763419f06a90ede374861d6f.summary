@entity0 -- parts of @entity4 's sweeping immigration law received a surprising amount of support from a short - handed @entity7 wednesday			1
states throughout the country considering their own tough immigration laws are closely following the proceedings over what has become a thorny issue			1
@entity14 up with illegal immigrants crossing from @entity16 -- and what they say is the federal government 's inability to stop it -- legislators in @entity4 passed a tough immigration law			1
the federal government sued , saying that @entity4 overreached			1
" if , in fact , somebody who does not belong in this country is in @entity4 , @entity4 has no power ? " asked justice @entity23			0
" what does sovereignty mean if it does not include the ability to defend your borders ? " even liberal justice @entity33 told the federal governments ' lawyer that key parts of his arguments were " not selling very well			1
" federal courts had blocked four elements of the state 's @entity40 , known as @entity40			1
while intense oral arguments took place among the justices , outside there were competing demonstrations on the courthouse plaza , with the law 's opponents saying it promotes discrimination and racial profiling			2
backers say illegal immigration has created public safety and economic crises			2
at issue is whether states have any authority to step in to enforce immigration matters or whether that is the exclusive role of the federal government			1
in dry legal terms , this constitutional question is known as pre-emption			0
other states watch for outcome @entity67 , lawyer for @entity4 , told the high court the federal government has long failed to control the problem , and that states have discretion to assist in enforcing immigration laws			1
but the @entity76 administration 's solicitor general , @entity74 , strongly countered that assertion , saying immigration matters are under the federal government 's exclusive authority and state " interference " would only make matters worse			1
several other states followed @entity4 's lead by passing laws meant to deter illegal immigrants			1
similar laws are under challenge in lower courts in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			1
@entity4 's appeal is the first to reach the @entity7			2
@entity4 is the nation 's most heavily traveled corridor for illegal immigration and smuggling			1
opinion : what if justices let states make immigration policy ? justice @entity105 did not hear this case			1
before taking the bench last year , she had been involved in the administration 's initial legal opposition to the law as solicitor general			1
a 4 - 4 high court split would be likely to keep the @entity4 law in legal limbo , preventing the four provisions of the law from going into effect but not settling the larger constitutional questions			2
it would also shift the election - year fight over the issue to other states with current or pending crackdown laws			1
the four @entity4 provisions on hold are : -- a requirement that local police officers check a person 's immigration status while enforcing other laws if " reasonable suspicion " exists that the person is in the @entity132 illegally			1
-- a provision authorizing police to arrest immigrants without warrant where " probable cause " exists that they committed any public offense making them removable from the country			0
-- a section making it a state crime for " unauthorized immigrants " to fail to carry registration papers and other government identification			1
-- a ban on those not authorized for employment in the @entity132 to apply , solicit or perform work			0
that would include immigrants standing in a parking lot who " gesture or nod " their willingness to be employed			0
although the specific question before the high court relates to the law 's enforcement , the justices could use the appeal to address the broader constitutional questions			1
@entity16 migration slows , but debate is n't over during the 70 - minute arguments , @entity67 faced relatively little tough questioning from left - leaning members of the bench			2
" there will be a significant number of people who will be detained at the stop , or in prison , for a significantly longer period of time " if the state law is allowed to be enforced , warned justice @entity171			2
justice @entity180 said the provision on carrying registration is especially problematic			0
" @entity183 enacted a complete registration scheme which the states can not complement or impose even auxiliary regulations , " she said			2
" we want the registration scheme to be wholly federal			2
" but the consistently tough questions were aimed at @entity74 from conservative members of the high court			0
even before the solicitor general began speaking midway through the argument , chief justice @entity191 framed the debate away from what has become a major complaint about the law : that it would target mostly @entity200 people for scrutiny and detention			1
" i 'd like to clear up at the outset what it 's not about , " @entity191 said			1
" no part of your argument has to do with racial or ethnic profiling , does it ? " @entity74 readily agreed			0
later the chief justice raised more serious concerns			0
when enforcing other law , " the person is already stopped for some other reason			0
he 's stopped for going 60 in a 20 ( mph zone )			0
he 's stopped for drunk driving			0
so that decision to stop the individual has nothing to do with immigration law at all			0
all that has to do with immigration law is whether or not they can ask the federal government to find out if this person is illegal or not , and then leave it up to you , " @entity191 said to @entity74			1
" it seems to me that the federal government just does n't want to know who is here illegally or not			1
" justice @entity231 echoed the thought , suggesting the federal government is not doing enough on illegal immigration , which might give states discretion to intervene			1
suppose , he offered , " the state of @entity4 has a massive emergency with social disruption , economic disruption , residents leaving the state because of a flood of immigrants			0
let 's just assume those two things			0
does that give the state of @entity4 any powers or authority or legitimate concerns that any other state would n't have ? " @entity231 was echoing what the state had long been arguing , and he later suggested there is such authority			1
@entity74 argued the law would hurt @entity0 's ability to carry out diplomatic relations with other nations , noting , " we have very significant issues on the border with @entity16			0
" " well , ca n't you avoid that particular foreign relations problem by simply deporting these people ? " @entity23 asked			0
" free them from the jails and send them back to the countries that are objecting			0
what 's the problem with that ? " we have to enforce our laws in a manner that will please @entity16			2
is that what you 're saying ? " the @entity279 said @entity4 's population of 2 million @entity281 includes an estimated 400,000 there illegally , and 60 % to 70 % of deportations or " removals " involve @entity16 nationals			0
a tale of opposing views in @entity4 the court hearing over the illegal immigration law comes at an interesting time			2
the @entity290 this week released a report that found that @entity16 immigration to the @entity132 has come to a standstill			0
the economic downturn in the @entity132 and better conditions in @entity16 , along with deportations and other enforcement , has led many to return to @entity16			0
however , the debate continues as more than 10 million unauthorized immigrants -- from @entity16 and other countries -- continue to live in the @entity132			0
even if immigration has slowed to lows not seen in decades , proponents of tough immigration laws want to beef up enforcement ahead of any future pressures			2
after the arguments , @entity4 gov. @entity307 expressed hope the state would prevail at the high court			2
" we likely will not know the court 's decision for weeks , " she said			1
" but i am filled with optimism -- the kind that comes with knowing that @entity4 's cause is just and its course is true			0
" the administration , backed by a variety of immigrant and civil rights groups , says allowing such discretionary state authority would hurt relations between the @entity132 and other countries , disrupt existing cooperative efforts and unfairly target legal immigrants			0
the legislation has a variety of supporters and detractors			0
@entity333 lawmakers , outspoken @entity334 , @entity4 , sheriff @entity335 and various state governments were among those filing briefs supporting the law			0
the @entity16 government , the @entity339 , the @entity339 and the city of @entity341 , @entity4 , were among those supporting the @entity279 's side			2
the outcome of the @entity4 appeal could set important precedent on similar laws pending across the country			1
the case is @entity4 v. @entity132 ( 11 - 182 ) and is to be the last argued before the high court this term			2
a ruling could come in late june , just before the justices recess for the summer .			0

@entity191 says it seems the federal government does n't want to know immigration status
the solicitor general warns against state " interference " in immigration
@entity33 says the federal government 's case is " not selling very well "
the court 's ruling will affect similar laws in several other states
