-- @entity1 likes to tout his conservative credentials			2
" i 've been a great , consistent leader of the conservative cause , " the former two - term @entity4 senator from @entity5 told @entity0 's @entity6 recently			1
" i 've been someone who 's had ideas , fought for those ideas and have been able to accomplish things			0
" @entity1 formally announced his bid for the @entity4 presidential nomination on june 6 , telling an audience that , " i 'm ready to lead			1
i 'm ready to do what has to be done for the next generation			0
" @entity1 made his kickoff comments at a campaign event in @entity19 in the western part of his home state , near where his grandfather worked in a coal mine after coming to @entity24 from @entity25			1
@entity1 said his grandfather came to @entity19 to escape fascist italy , to " give his children , my dad , who 7 years old when he came in 1930 , the opportunity for freedom , to live your dreams , because he knew @entity24 believed in him , believed in people , gave people a shot , if they worked hard , they could succeed			1
" @entity1 is arguably the most frequent flyer in the battle for the 2012 @entity4 presidential nomination			2
since 2009 , he has made 15 trips to @entity41 , where the caucus is the first contest in the election cycle , 18 to @entity45 , which holds the first primary , and 15 to @entity47 , the state that holds the first primary in the @entity47			0

@entity1 will appear june 13 at a @entity0 / @entity61 / @entity60 debate in the @entity45			2
for all his travel and appearances , @entity1 still has very low name recognition among most @entity24 , and according to just about every poll , he registers in the low single digits nationally among @entity4 voters when it comes to the choice for their party 's next presidential nominee			1
because of his poll numbers and because he faces much better - funded rivals , @entity1 faces long odds in his bid for the @entity4 presidential nomination			1
but because of his strong opposition to abortion rights and gay rights , @entity1 remains popular with many socially conservative voters who have long had an influential role in the @entity4 primary process			1
earlier this spring , @entity1 made headlines by winning a much - watched straw poll at the @entity85 , @entity47 , @entity4 convention			1
at the @entity93 , a recent gathering of social conservatives in @entity92 , @entity1 highlighted his credentials saying , " i had always been pro-life , i had always been for traditional marriage , but i had always been like a lot of folks -- a lot of folks who were n't here last year but are here this year who come and make the pledge , vow to social conservatives that they 'll check the boxes , they 'll be for the things social conservatives care about			1
ladies and gentlemen , i do n't just take the pledge , i take the bullets			0
" @entity1 also emphasizes his pro-israel stance as well as his experience in the @entity109 when it comes to foreign policy , which could distinguish him from most of his rivals			0
and he is hyping his fiscal conservative credentials			0
in recent interviews , @entity1 suggested that @entity117 chairman rep. @entity116 's controversial budget is not strong enough , saying " not even @entity116 and his budget now has the temerity to go after @entity121 , " @entity1 was elected to the @entity117 in 1990 , at age 32 , and first elected to the @entity109 four years later			0
he lost his 2006 re-election bid by 18 points to @entity126 @entity125 and until last year was largely out of public view except for appearances on the @entity129			1
he 's married with seven children			0
