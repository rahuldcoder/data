the world 's highest railway rolls even closer to @entity2 this month when @entity3 inaugurates a stretch of track connecting the @entity7 cities of @entity8 and @entity9			1
traversing valleys , mountains and crossing the glacier - fed @entity13 , the line takes in breathtaking views of snow - capped peaks and majestic plateaus as it wends from the territory 's capital to its second city			0
the track is an extension of the @entity25 - @entity24 line -- an engineering marvel named the " closest stretch of railway to the sky " after it first carried passengers above 5,000 meters ( 16,404 feet ) in 2006			0
work on the new $ 2.1 billion line across the roof of the world began in 2010			0
when it opens , it will allow passengers to connect by rail from @entity38 all the way to @entity9 , a gateway to @entity2 , which lies just 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) away , on the border with @entity42			1
@entity43 , an officer with @entity9 's tourism department , told @entity45 the railway would be inaugurated at the end of august and would initially carry @entity3 visitors			1
" the first batch of tourists are from @entity52 provice , " she said			0
huge investment with the arrival of the train , the journey from @entity8 to @entity9 shrinks five hours of driving over terrain ranging in altitude from 3,600 to 4,000 meters , to two hours by rail			1
the railway is part of a huge @entity3 investment program in the infrastructure of its remote western territories that is seen as an effort to consolidate @entity38 's economic and political control of the autonomous region			1
such developments have not been welcomed by some @entity7 who say @entity3 invaded their land in 1950 and dispute @entity38 's claim that the @entity72 plateau has historically been part of @entity3			2
political tensions mean that access to the railway for @entity78 tourists is likely to be subject to tight controls			0
in addition to @entity3 visas , foreign visitors already require special permits to enter @entity24 and the availability of these is subject to sudden change			0
anyone hoping to travel on from @entity9 to @entity2 or @entity42 will have to wade through further red tape .			2
