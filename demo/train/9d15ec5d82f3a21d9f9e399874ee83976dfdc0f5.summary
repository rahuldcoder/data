-- we 're all thirsty and we do n't even know it			2
but an @entity4 start - up called @entity5 aims to solve this problem			1
although they 're only in a developmental stage right now ( read : give us your money ! ) , the company managed to turn more than a few heads online this week when prototypes of their new products were featured on @entity14 and several other websites			2
the product is a @entity18 band ( or sleeve )			1
you attach it around your water bottle and it monitors your fluid intake , reminding you , with sounds and led indicators , that , perhaps , its time to drink more water			1
or , if you 've filled your @entity29 with vodka , then perhaps it 's time to stroll through the hallway naked , stealing office supplies			2
" @entity33 , that 's my highlighter			2
" naturally , the band will also sync up to your mobile device via @entity37 so you can check your hydration stats			1
presumably while you urinate for the next 30 minutes			2
what you might actually do with this water - consumption info is sort of a mystery , but i suppose sharing it with friends is no less ridiculous than pontificating over your fantasy football results			1
in fact , i 'd rather hear all about your fluid intake far more than how many fake points @entity51 scored in your week 3 win over the @entity53			2
hopefully , unlike those super-fantasy nerds , @entity55 fanatics will eventually give it a rest			2
because the start - up claims their crusade is " to make sure we never forget it			0
" " it " being to drink water			1
that , or the @entity64			0
so , it 'll be interesting to see if this product eventually takes off			0
especially since at least one similar product already exists in the market -- the @entity69			0
( now with the special @entity71 ! when it 's time to drink , @entity69 will call you a homophobic slur and launch basketballs at your head ! operators are standing by ! ) sadly , however , despite all these innovative devices , and despite the fact that water is so important to our health , i do n't think i 'll ever actually give up on @entity84			1
i 'm in the cult			1
and i 'm in it real bad			1
you see , the day you start selling black market copper wire to pay for @entity84 is the day you realize you have a serious problem			1
and when you then find yourself missing your kid 's t - ball game to slug down 20 - ouncers under a bridge with actual addicts , that 's when it 's time to officially re-evaluate your life			0
" hey , man , beat it ! this place is for serious drugs ! " fortunately , for me , it never came to that			0
but there was certainly a semi-dangerous period in life where my body 's entire liquid intake consisted only of @entity84			1
and i say that without a hint of hyperbole			0
on a normal day i would drink three or four cans at work and then come home to literally chug out of a 2 - liter bottle from the fridge			1
but they do n't dig me nearly as much as my dog , @entity121 , who would anxiously stare up into my eyes as i power - blasted " daddy 's medicine			0
" @entity121 stared partly because i think he was amazed at what a disgusting , chemically infused human pig i had become			0
but he also stared because he was ( and is ) always a grateful recipient of the empty plastic bottle			0
which , for a dog , is basically like getting a new @entity131 64 every single day			0
you know , back when that was actually a relevant analogy			0
of course , despite the 100 % scientific fact that @entity84 is made from the tears of angels and unicorns , and carbonated by the gentle vibrations of @entity141 's voice , i believe -- though , some research does n't necessarily agree -- that a major negative side effect of this addiction is chronic dehydration			1
but it 's not water			1
either way , it probably was n't a smart way to live , and i was always parched			0
so i 've worked out some rules to help ease me back into healthy hydration			0
mind you , they 're terrible rules , and i routinely bend them to achieve a far more important goal			0
namely , to drink more @entity84			1
i 'm enjoying one right now			2
they 're everywhere ! the basic idea is that i can only have @entity84 on the weekends and days off from work			1
however , business travel counts as a weekend			0
and , if @entity84 is provided free as part of a work lunch or company event , that also negates the not - at - the - office rule			1
additionally , friday at 12:00:01 a.m. is when weekends officially start			0
and if i 'm going on vacation , the last actual day of work that week counts as a friday			2
other exceptions include national holidays , important televised soccer matches ( including pre- and post-game analysis ) , and whenever somebody says the secret magic word			0
today it 's " @entity178			0
" so , if you 're a betting man , the smart money is on another @entity84 ! i also have a good feeling about the @entity53 .			1

@entity5 hopes their prototype band will *encourage* *people* to drink more water
the band would use @entity37 to snyc up to your mobile device to record stats
