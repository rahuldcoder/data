@entity0 , @entity1 -- a survivor of the fatal @entity5 flotilla incident in may headed out saturday on a new convoy to bring medical supplies to the @entity9 territory			1
@entity10 departed @entity0 on saturday morning with about a dozen vans and more than 30 international volunteers as part of the @entity15 5 convoy			2
two other convoys were being organized at the same time from @entity18 , @entity19 , and @entity20 , @entity21 , his group said			1
the three convoys will aim to meet in @entity24 before traveling together to @entity5 , organizers said			1
" our mission last time was to take aid in and to highlight the siege , " @entity10 told @entity2			2
" that 's our mission this time			0
" nine @entity30 activists died may 31 when @entity32 troops boarded the @entity33 , a flotilla of activists heading to @entity5			1
@entity32 has maintained its troops used force on the activists after they were attacked by those onboard , but passengers on the boat insisted they were fired on without provocation			0
" i witnessed the man one meter in front of me being shot in the leg , a man 50 centimeters to the back right of me being shot through the abdomen , " @entity10 said of the experience			0
" neither of them had anything in their hands			0
there was no @entity32 commandos within the immediate proximity			0
they were shot from above , so it was simply unfeasible -- in that incident i saw -- for anyone to claim they were in fear of their lives when they rang out those shots			0
" the incident drew international outrage and badly shook a wide - ranging military and diplomatic alliance between the jewish state and @entity30 , its powerful regional ally			1
@entity32 maintains it must inspect all goods entering @entity5 so that weapons do not get into the hands of militants			2
@entity5 is run by @entity73 , the @entity9 @entity74 movement that has said it is dedicated to the destruction of @entity32			2
unlike the flotilla in may , the convoy aims to enter @entity5 by land , through the @entity80 border crossing with @entity81 , @entity10 said			1
when the three convoys meet in @entity24 , they plan to be shipped past the point at which the @entity33 was attacked and down to the @entity81 port of @entity86 before going to @entity80 , he said			0
organizers said it is the largest convoy set to break the @entity5 embargo			1
