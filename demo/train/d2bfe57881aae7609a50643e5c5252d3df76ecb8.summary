it remains a concern that the virus will spread beyond those areas , he said , and " this is most likely to be done by somebody traveling			0
" however , he said , exit screening for those leaving hotspot countries -- which can include taking travelers ' temperature , asking them to fill out a questionnaire and checking out any fever for a risk of @entity1 infection -- " probably does have a quite important deterrent effect			2
