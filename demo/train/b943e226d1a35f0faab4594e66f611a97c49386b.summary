@entity0 -- president @entity2 marked the one - year anniversary of his controversial economic stimulus plan wednesday , declaring the $ 862 billion package an unequivocal success that has created or saved millions of jobs			1
house speaker @entity8 and members of @entity2 's cabinet also fanned out across the country in a slew of separate events designed to amplify the president 's claims			1
@entity17 opponents belittled the president 's assertion , and characterized the plan as a massive waste - filled @entity0 special - interest giveaway that expanded the deficit while failing to slow rising unemployment			1
the radically different claims reflected the high political stakes tied to the public perception of what many observers consider the signature legislative achievement of @entity2 's first year in office			1
" we have rescued this economy from the worst of this crisis , " @entity2 said at the @entity32			1
" we acted because failure to do so would have led to catastrophe			0
we acted because we had a larger responsibility than simply winning the next election			0
we had a responsibility to do what was right			0
" the measure " was never intended to save every job , " he said			0
" businesses are the true engine of growth [ and ] always will be			2
but during a recession ... what government can do is provide a temporary boost			0
" the program , he said , has " run cleanly , smoothly and transparently			1
" vice president @entity52 , the administration 's point man on implementation of the plan , argued that " without any question " the package is working and " laying the foundation " for long - term economic growth			1
" we know times are [ still ] tough for too many people , " he said			0
but there is " no reason we 're not going to come out of this [ downturn ] stronger than when we went into it			0
" the bulk of the money initially allocated for the plan has not actually been spent yet			2
through the end of january , roughly $ 334 billion in spending has been approved , of which $ 179 billion has actually left federal coffers			0
another $ 119 billion has gone to tax cuts			0
the federal government now expects to distribute $ 32 billion in stimulus funds per month , up from an average $ 27 billion a month over the past year , according to @entity52			1
now that the economy is no longer in free fall , the mix of spending will change , senior administration officials said			2
until this point , the bulk of the spending has been on tax relief and direct aid , such as unemployment benefits			0
to date , only $ 31 billion has been spent on projects such as infrastructure , high - speed rail , broadband and health technology			2
but in the second phase of the act , the amount of money going to these initiatives will more than double to $ 7 billion a month as work on them ramps up			0
the administration views this spending as setting the stage for a lasting expansion			0
" many projects are just now getting under way , and will be creating jobs throughout 2010 and beyond , " @entity52 said earlier this week			1
" work on many @entity108 projects will accelerate in the spring and summer months as weather conditions permit work on roads , bridges , water projects , and @entity115 site cleanups			0
" in depth : the stimulus project payments to states and individuals will fall to $ 11 billion per month , from $ 14 billion			2
much of this spending -- such as @entity123 funding and additional unemployment benefits -- was meant to stabilize the economy during the recession			2
the administration will reach its goal to disburse 70 percent of the @entity108 funds , or $ 551 billion , by september 30 , senior administration officials said			0
the nonpartisan @entity131 recently hiked the cost estimate of the stimulus plan to $ 862 billion , though the administration still uses the original $ 787 billion figure			1
@entity17 have torn into what they argue is the stimulus ' failure			1
the @entity139 released a video wednesday claiming that " the @entity142 people are tired of politicians who do n't admit when their policies do n't work			0
the president and the @entity146 can either admit their policies failed and change course now or continue their binge spending agenda and face certain defeat at the polls in november			0
" @entity32 minority leader @entity152 , @entity153 , said earlier in the week that taxpayers " are n't getting their money 's worth from the trillion - dollar ' stimulus ' and struggling families and small businesses are rightly asking , ' where are the jobs ? ' " @entity162 rep. @entity162 , @entity163 , said states have lost a total of 2.9 million jobs between the bill 's enactment last february through december , though the administration projected stimulus would save or create 3.5 million positions			1
@entity2 teased congressional republicans on wednesday for slamming the plan " even as many of them show up for ribbon - cutting ceremonies for projects in their districts " funded by the act			1
in the final quarter of last year , the @entity108 directly funded nearly 600,000 jobs , according to the web site @entity182			1
the figure is based on about 160,000 reports from state , local and corporate recipients who have spent $ 57.9 billion in stimulus money			2
it does not tally jobs created indirectly through companies buying supplies for stimulus projects , people spending their tax cuts , increased unemployment benefits and the like			1
in total , the economic stimulus program has boosted employment by 1.5 million to 2 million jobs , the president 's chief economic adviser said in mid-january			1
that figure is derived from a mathematical formula based on how much money has flowed out the federal door			0
a @entity208 poll conducted last month found a majority of respondents -- 56 percent -- opposed the stimulus plan			1
forty - two percent supported it			2
fifty - eight percent , however , believed the stimulus had stabilized or improved the economy , while 41 percent said it either had no effect or had made the economy worse			1
the poll of 1,021 adults was conducted by telephone from january 8 - 10 , and had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points			2
@entity1 's @entity224 and @entity225 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 says stimulus plan rescued economy from " worst of this crisis "
program , one year old , has run " smoothly , cleanly , transparently " , @entity2 says
@entity17 charge the program expanded deficit without creating jobs
stimulus laid foundation for long - term growth , *vp* @entity52 says
