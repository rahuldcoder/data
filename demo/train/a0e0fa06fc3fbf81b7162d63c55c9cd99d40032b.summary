-- an @entity2 man is demanding a direct apology from a @entity5 agent in @entity6 who , the man says , spilled his grandfather 's ashes during an airport bag check and then laughed off the incident			1
and @entity14 is also demanding that the @entity5 release any security surveillance tapes of the incident , tapes that the federal agency said simply do n't exist			1
@entity14 , 30 , was returning home from visiting family in @entity19 , @entity6 , on june 19 , carrying with him a portion of his grandfather 's ashes that had been passed along by an uncle -- a " real sentimental kind of guy , " said @entity14 -- when he approached @entity5 screeners			1
a female agent wearing blue latex gloves inspected the contents of his bag , says @entity14 , including the jar clearly labeled " @entity31			0
" air rage : passengers ' quicker to snap ' " i said , ' please be careful , these are my grandpa 's ashes , ' " @entity14 told @entity0 wednesday			1
but , he said , the agent proceeded to stick her finger in the jar then accidentally spilled its contents on the airport floor			1
she then laughed , according to @entity14 , not an uproarious cackle , but a chuckle that he found offensive nonetheless			1
" she thought it was funny , " he said			0
" i wanted to smack her			0
" while not directly contradicting @entity14 , the @entity5 said it believes his sequence of events is incorrect			1
triumphs and woes : a timeline of the @entity5 's evolution " our initial review concluded that the circumstances as described in some reports are inconsistent with what we believe transpired , " an initial statement from the @entity5 said			2
that pronouncement prompted @entity14 , who said he would otherwise be content to drop his contention , to once again assail the agency			0
" i do n't want this to continue , " he said wednesday in an interview with @entity0 , but " now i 'm really heated because the @entity5 is coming back and saying there 's inconsistencies in the reports			2
" report : @entity5 security breaches mishandled the @entity5 statement added that " under no circumstances should a container holding remains be opened			2
" " @entity5 recognizes the importance of screening human remains with utmost respect and dignity while remaining vigilant of our security mission to protect the traveling public , " its statement said			2
@entity5 spokesman @entity83 said tuesday that there is no surveillance video relevant to the episode , and the agency followed that on wednesday by adding that the security cameras in question are being upgraded			0
gross , however , said he believes the agency is concealing the truth			0
" if they do n't have any tapes , it obviously shows they are hiding something , " he told @entity0			0
the situation calmed later wednesday , after @entity14 said he received what he viewed as a " sincere " and " heartfelt " apology from a @entity5 administrator , but he was still bothered by the federal agency 's public declaration that his story had " inconsistencies " with what the @entity5 said happened			1
and he still wanted " the apology from the person who did it ... " as for the spilled ashes of his grandfather , @entity14 said he did the best he could to recover as much as possible			1
" i could n't get a broom and dust pan , but i picked up the bigger pieces on the ground and i put them in the jar , " @entity14 said			0
i tried getting what i could but there was a long line behind me			0
