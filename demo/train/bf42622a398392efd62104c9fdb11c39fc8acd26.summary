-- " death rays " sound more like a sci - fi creation than a pool - side concern , but guests soaking up the sun at the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , might want to take cover			1
according to a report in the @entity14 , the reflective hotel 's south - facing tower can bounce rays that will melt plastic and singe hair at certain times of the day and year			1
visiting lawyer @entity19 from @entity20 , @entity21 , had a scorching encounter and said hotel pool employees told him they call it " the death ray , " according to the report			1
@entity19 , who co-owns a @entity6 condo , told the @entity14 his hair was singed as he was reclining on the pool deck around noon on a mid-september day			1
" i was effectively being cooked , " @entity19 said			0
" i started running as fast as i could without looking like a lunatic			0
" the rays also melted the thin plastic bag around his newspaper , @entity19 said			0
hotel designers were aware of potential solar " convergence " and applied a film that reduced the problem by about 70 percent before the @entity6 opened in december 2009 , according to @entity38 spokesman @entity37			1
" what remains are seasonal hot spots that are most acute of course in the summertime , " @entity37 said			2
historic high temperatures in @entity7 this summer have intensified the problem			0
hotel staffers are aware of the hot spots and move guests around the pool deck when necessary , @entity37 said			2
planners are also looking at additional shading options or putting planters where the rays get particularly hot , he said			2
the hotel has n't received any complaints of injury beyond those reported by @entity19			2
" death ray " media coverage in recent weeks has n't had any effect on bookings , @entity37 said , and a 72 - hour rate sale under way now is unrelated to the buzz			1
" i suppose there might even be folks who are very passionate about the sun who want to come see it , " @entity37 said			0
" it is n't a visible thing ... if you were standing in the middle of it when it 's 110 [ degrees ] , you 're going to feel it			0
we happen to be in a much cooler week this week so right now , today , it might actually feel good , " he said , laughing .			0
