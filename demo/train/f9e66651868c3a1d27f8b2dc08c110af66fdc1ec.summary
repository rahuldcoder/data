@entity0 -- there is no basic human right to barge into a church to make a political statement , jump around near the altar , and shout obscenities			1
but there is most certainly the right not to lose your liberty for doing so , even if the act is offensive			1
but that is exactly what happened friday			0
a court in @entity0 sentenced the three members of the feminist punk band @entity17 to two years in prison			2
in my two decades monitoring human rights in @entity21 i 've never seen anything like the @entity17 case -- the media attention , the outpouring of public support , the celebrity statements for the detained and criminally charged punk band members			1
the image of three young women facing down an inexorable system of unfair justice and an oppressive state has crystallized for many in the @entity35 what is wrong with human rights in @entity21			1
to be sure , it is deeply troubling			0
for me , even more shocking were the images of @entity40 , a human rights lawyer , lying on the sidewalk with the back of his head blown off in 2009 , or the body of tax lawyer @entity46 , who died in prison in 2009 after he blew the whistle on a massive government extortion scheme			1
the @entity17 case shines a much needed , if highly disturbing , spotlight on the issue of freedom of expression in @entity56 on february 21 , four members of the group performed what they call a " punk prayer " in @entity0 's @entity61			1
they danced around and shouted some words to their song , " @entity64 , get @entity65			0
" the stunt lasted less than a minute before the women were forcibly removed			0
the same day , a video widely shared on social media showed a montage of the stunt with the song spliced in			0
the song criticizes the @entity74 's alleged close relationship with the @entity75 and the personally close relationship of president @entity77 with the patriarch of the @entity74			2
three of the band members were tried on criminal " hooliganism " charges			0
their trial was theater of the absurd			0
in their closing statements , the women and their lawyers delivered devastating critiques of the state of justice and civic freedoms in @entity21			1
during the @entity94 era , the human rights landscape in @entity21 was stark			1
but since then the situation has been harder to figure out , often making it easier for outsiders simply to give the government a pass			2
but the devil is in the details			0
it has been incredibly difficult to pin down any involvement of officials in the beatings and murders of investigative journalists and human rights activists			1
and the government , while not silencing civil society groups outright , tries to marginalize , discredit , and humiliate them , and crush them with heavy - handed bureaucracy , trumped - up accusations , threats and the like			0
whatever misdemeanor the three women incurred for their antics in the church should not have been transformed by the authorities into a criminal offense that in effect punishes them for their speech			0
it 's typical , though , of how the authorities try to keep a lid on controversial issues			0
the @entity21 think tank @entity128 has documented dozens of cases in recent years in which the authorities used the threat of extremism charges to silence critics			2
this also is n't the first time @entity21 authorities have misused criminal legislation to stifle critical artistic expression			2
in 2010 a @entity0 district court found the co-organizers of a controversial art exhibit guilty of the vague charge of " inciting religious hatred			0
" the art exhibit organizers were fined			0
by making the @entity17 band members await trial in jail for almost six months , the authorities made clear how they plan to set boundaries for political criticism			1
after a winter of unprecedented , peaceful opposition protests , a dozen demonstrators whom the authorities claim were involved in a scuffle with police during a mass demonstration in may have been arrested and are being charged with crimes grossly disproportionate to their alleged actions			0
police have searched opposition leaders ' homes			0
laws rammed through @entity21 's parliament this summer sent more signals : criminal liability for leaders of nongovernmental organizations for " serious breaches " of new restrictive regulations ; much tougher sanctions for violating rules on public assembly ; and new restrictions on the internet that could easily shut down big social networking sites			1
critics of the @entity75 have been subject to vicious harassment , intimidation and grotesque public smear campaigns			0
for years @entity21 human rights defenders have tried to draw attention to the lack of independence of the courts			1
with the unprecedented attention to the @entity17 trial , the surreal state of justice when political interests are at stake is there for all to see			1
what we really should be wondering is n't why @entity17 is so distinctive , but whether it 's just the tip of the iceberg			1
too often , foreign governments have resorted to wishful thinking about the direction @entity21 is heading			2
talking about human rights at a high level -- where all things in @entity21 are decided -- is unpleasant business			1
it might be hard , but @entity21 wo n't respect other governments if they shy away			2
if three women in the defendants ' cage had the courage to speak out about where @entity21 is headed , surely members of the international community should too			1
they , at least , wo n't be thrown in jail			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			2

@entity212 : no on should lose liberty for dancing on an altar to make a political statement
she says guilty **verdict** on @entity17 shows @entity21 's unfair justice system , oppressive state
she says : *modern* @entity21 *slippery* on human rights ; other nations *mistakenly* give it a pass
@entity212 : **verdict** is tip of iceberg of @entity21 oppression ; world community must speak out
