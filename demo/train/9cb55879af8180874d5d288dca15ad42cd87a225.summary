@entity0 -- @entity3 , @entity4 , residents could see one of the region 's biggest political footballs flying overhead this week : a drone			2
the use of an unmanned aircraft was approved tuesday by the @entity11 to help search for missing @entity14 student @entity13			1
the drone deployment , while legal , highlights an ongoing political debate -- at the local and state level -- on whether use of the aviation technology is a violation of civil liberties			1
legal limits on unmanned aircraft use by state and local law enforcements were instituted by the @entity4 state legislature in february 2013 , earning the support of civil liberties proponents and marking an historic first across the nation			1
the moratorium lasts until july 2015 , when the legislation will be reconsidered and some proponents say it ca n't come quickly enough			0
" there 's been an overreaction on the part of state legislatures with respect to this technology , " said @entity35 , who represents drone operators as special counsel at @entity38			1
authorities say the drone , an @entity47 , could be used in the @entity3 area for as long as they are useful -- news that might anger proponents of the ban , where the city itself voted to outlaw the use of drones even beyond the restrictions of the state moratorium			1
" drones will spy on us without our permission in violation of our constitutional rights under the 4th amendment , " said @entity58 , an activist who brought the initial anti-drone resolution to the @entity3 city council , in february			1
@entity35 pointed out that state legislators ' " knee - jerk reaction " highlighting privacy concerns is often overblown given state laws which prohibit invasions of privacy			0
instead , he said , drone opponents should consider their financial and safety benefits			0
" there is absolutely no question that using a battery powered small drone is much more cost effective than a manned helicopter , " he said , noting that in some circumstances , unmanned aircraft can often replace as many as 100 ground - based volunteers			2
" this is like any other technology , " he added			0
" there are great benefits that we can obtain from it when it 's used appropriately , and we should not curtail those benefits on the premise that the technology is always going to be abused			0
" @entity94 , chief engineer of the @entity95 , said the drone being used this week will be used to " look closer " at objects of interest , and will be able to cover areas across the region too difficult to reach with an atv or even see with a manned helicopter			2
more than 50 law enforcement personnel are also participating in the search on the ground			2
so far , police have searched more than 175 square miles in the mission to find @entity108 , which is now in its third week after she disappeared from the @entity111 area of @entity3 on sept. 13			0
investigators have identified @entity113 , 32 , as the last person seen with @entity108			0
he 's been charged with abduction with the intent to defile			0
while the search continues both on ground and in air , some groups who supported the moratorium agree that use by local law enforcement should be allowed			1
the @entity125 , a @entity3 - based civil liberties organization notable for its hand in advocating for the local moratorium , has rallied behind the use of drones in the @entity108 case			2
" we are all concerned about what has happened to @entity13 , and if using aerial drones can find her or at least provide some leads to law enforcement , all the better , " @entity133 , president of the @entity125 , said in a statement			1
" the key moving forward is to ensure that appropriate civil liberties safeguards are in place , but that is a conversation for another day and time			0

the @entity11 approved drone use for helping in the search for @entity13 .
state *lawmakers* issued moratorium on drone use in february 2013 .
drones are used to record images of places hard to reach on the ground .
