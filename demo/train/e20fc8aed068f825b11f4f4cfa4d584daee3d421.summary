@entity0 , which was until recently the world 's largest producer of solar panels , has said its main subsidiary in @entity5 is bankrupt , in a further stark illustration of the declining fortunes of the global solar industry			1
@entity0 's @entity10 subsidiary is the first big @entity5 solar group to declare insolvency and the world 's biggest such bankruptcy , following a string of failed western solar companies including @entity17 in @entity18 and @entity19 in the @entity20			1
" what the @entity0 case shows us is that the @entity5 companies are not too big to fail , " said @entity21 , head of solar analysis at @entity23			1
" we are entering a period of great difficulty for @entity5 solar manufacturers			2
" @entity5 is the world 's biggest producer of solar panels , but the sector is suffering from overcapacity after rapid expansion fuelled by cheap loans and preferential government policies			1
@entity20 - listed @entity0 was the posterchild of the country 's swift entry into , and then dominance of , the market			2
it announced on wednesday that eight @entity5 banks had filed a petition for insolvency and restructuring of @entity0 in a court in @entity50 province			1
the bankruptcy is a milestone because , until now , @entity5 's larger struggling solar companies have been kept afloat by cheap credit and indirect state support			1
@entity0 defaulted last week on a $ 541m convertible bond issued by its @entity58 subsidiary , which triggered cross-defaults on other loans outstanding			2
according to the company 's most recent reports , @entity0 's net debt stood at $ 1.6bn at the end of march 2012			2
the case is set to be a big test of @entity5 's new bankruptcy law , which came into effect in 2007 but has rarely been applied to overseas - listed companies with assets in @entity5			0
it will be complicated by the fact that neither the @entity20 - listed entity , @entity0 , nor any subsidiaries other than @entity10 are declaring insolvency			0
" it 's going to be a test of what , exactly , do the @entity20 entities and the @entity58 entities really own ? " said one @entity77 - based analyst who asked not to be named			0
under @entity5 law , the courts will have six months to come up with a restructuring plan that is then presented to creditors , with the possibility of an additional three - month extension			0
bankruptcy specialist @entity89 , a partner at the @entity90 in @entity91 , said : " it is rare for such a big company to get into bankruptcy proceedings , even though many companies can not pay off their debts			0
" he cited local government bailouts , and creditor reluctance , as two main reasons why insolvent @entity5 companies avoid bankruptcy			0
the government of @entity10 , the city where @entity0 is headquartered , has come to @entity0 's aid in the past -- and appears to be taking an even more active role in the company with the appointment earlier this week of a new president , @entity108 , who previously worked for the government - backed @entity109 mr @entity89 said the co-ordinated action of the eight banks suggested the local government had given its blessing to the proceedings			0
" without government support , even if creditors file a petition , the court would n't accept it , " he explained			0
@entity120 , @entity0 's chief executive , said : " while we evaluate restructuring initiatives and strategic alternatives , we are committed to continuing to provide high - quality solar products to our global customer base			1
