@entity0 -- in the wake of a teacher misconduct scandal , @entity0 school officials have referred the discipline cases of 604 teachers from the past four years to state authorities to decide whether the teachers ' licenses should also be revoked , a school spokesman said thursday			1
of the 604 cases in which teachers were fired or facing discipline , 60 teachers were accused of sexual misconduct with pupils on or off campus or with minors who were n't students , school officials told @entity1			1
the @entity22 will investigate 366 of the 604 teacher cases , spokeswoman @entity21 said on thursday			1
most of the cases focused on allegations of teacher misconduct that involved student safety			1
the referral of the cases to state licensing investigators is the latest turn in the nation 's second largest school system			1
it has been reeling from a scandal at @entity37 , where two teachers have been charged with lewd acts on pupils , including one teacher accused of putting children in adult - like bondage situations and placing semen - filled spoons at their mouths			1
the lurid allegations prompted an internal review of the system 's handling of past teacher misconduct cases , and the district determined that 604 cases needed to be referred to state licensing authorities for review , though " a substantial number " of other misconduct cases had already been reported to the state , school officials told @entity1			1
" protecting @entity61 's schoolchildren is always a priority for the commission			0
the workload has been a challenge , but a necessary one , " commission executive director @entity66 said in a statement			0
the 604 cases include teachers who were disciplined or were about to face discipline since july 2008 , according to @entity71 , @entity37 director of employee relations , and @entity73 , the district 's chief human resources officer			1
the cases also include teachers who were fired by the school board or who left the district after termination proceedings were initiated or while an allegation of misconduct was pending , @entity83 and @entity73 said			1
the system does n't know whether any of the teachers who were fired or who left the district are still in the classroom in other school districts , according to @entity83 and @entity90			2
the 604 figure also includes teachers who were suspended for 11 days or more for a variety of reasons not involving sexual misconduct with students , the two officials said			1
" the safety of our students is our no. 1 priority , " @entity73 said in explaining why the system referred the 604 cases to the state			1
the @entity105 , the teachers ' union , had no comment thursday on the school board 's action , spokeswoman @entity104 said			2
the system 's internal investigation arose after parental outrage at @entity37 , where a teacher resigned from the system last year but was not referred to the state for possible license revocation , school district spokesman @entity110 said			1
that person is former teacher @entity37 , 61 , who pleaded not guilty in february to allegations he bound young students , then photographed them with semen - filled spoons held at their mouths and three - inch cockroaches crawling across their faces , among other graphic depictions			2
" we had not informed @entity129 to revoke mr. @entity131 's credentials , " @entity110 said			0
@entity131 's teaching credentials have been suspended , @entity21 said			0
@entity131 is being held on $ 23 million bond and faces 23 counts of lewd acts on a child			0
the 23 victims were between 7 and 10 years old , and all but two of them were girls , the @entity138 's @entity137 said			0
authorities have said they have discovered roughly 600 images allegedly taken by @entity131 in his classroom			0
@entity145 superintendent @entity144 has said @entity131 was removed from his teaching job in january 2011 after school officials learned of the police investigation			1
a teacher for 30 years , @entity131 initially challenged the school district 's decision to dismiss him			2
but he eventually dropped his appeal and resigned last spring			0
his arrest in january led to a broader fallout over the adequacy of safeguards for the school 's students and the prospect of more victims			2
days after @entity131 was taken into custody , another @entity37 teacher -- @entity37 , 49 -- was arrested and charged with three felony counts of lewd acts with a girl younger than 14			0
he has pleaded not guilty			0
the school board subsequently shut @entity37 for two days , during which the board reconstituted the entire staff in the 1,400 - student school			0
@entity37 is in unincorporated @entity138 within the @entity172 area , about six miles south of downtown @entity0			2
meanwhile , the @entity61 state auditor is going to carry out an emergency $ 300,000 audit of the @entity37 's actions in managing and documenting child abuse claims , said state assemblyman @entity177 , @entity178 , who sponsored the performance audit proposal			0
the incident at @entity37 and similar allegations of child sex abuse at other @entity0 public schools prompted the audit , @entity180 said			0
@entity1 's @entity186 contributed to this report .			0

@entity0 school officials submit 604 teacher discipline cases for state licensing review
state teaching licensing authorities say they will investigate 366 of the teachers
the action is fallout from a teacher misconduct scandal in the school system
" the safety of our students is our no. 1 priority , " @entity0 school official says
