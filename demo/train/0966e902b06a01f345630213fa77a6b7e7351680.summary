@entity0 -- president @entity3 's critics have the right to be upset by his decision to shield from deportation , at least temporarily , some groups of undocumented immigrants			1
but they do n't have the right to twist the facts , use inflammatory language and create confusion			2
they 're the ones who are most confused			0
they do n't appear to have the foggiest idea how the process would work			0
that 's their own fault			0
they should have paid closer attention two years ago , the last time the administration did something like this , with the program known as @entity26			2
simply put , @entity3 is using the executive power granted to him by the @entity28 to reshuffle the immigration enforcement deck and prioritize deportations so that , for instance , the undocumented parents of @entity33 - born citizens get a temporary " deferred " status and thus ca n't be removed for three years			1
but you should read the fine print			0
there are a lot of strings attached , and there is no guarantee that some of these people wo n't be deported			0
it 's a crap shoot for undocumented immigrants , which explains why only a little over half of the young people who were eligible for @entity26 took the risk and applied for it , according to the @entity51			1
no one can say what will happen when @entity3 's new deferment expires			1
a lot will depend on the political mood at the time , and what the new president will decide , in 2017 , to do with immigrants who are holding these deferments			0
there could be extensions offered , or it could be the end of the road			0
if it 's the latter , a large number of undocumented immigrants -- media reports have put the potential figure at 5 million , although the actual figure is likely to be much lower , given the response to @entity26 -- will be deportable once again			1
the administration has said that the new program -- which it is calling @entity74 , @entity75 -- would work much the same way as its predecessor , @entity26			1
@entity3 announced that program in june 2012 and it took effect about six months later			2
under @entity26 , undocumented young people brought here as children can apply for a two - year " deferred action " that lets them remain in the country temporarily without fear of being deported			1
yet there is a catch -- when you deal with government , there 's always a catch			0
i 'll explain what it is in a minute			0
but first , let 's listen to what has been coming from the sky - is - falling chorus in the @entity99			0
@entity3 's conservative critics really do say the darnedest things			1
a recurring theme is that @entity3 is acting outside the law , rewriting the law or ignoring the law			1
when i asked one conservative commentator to explain , he said : " well , there was a law on the books that said a person ca n't be in the country illegally ? now they can			2
he did no such thing			0
@entity3 merely applied to the enforcement of immigration laws something that all police , prosecutors and judges have : discretion			1
now it turns out i have to explain this simple concept to @entity3 himself			2
this week , the president responded to hecklers at a speech in @entity130 who were demanding that he ease up on deportations by insisting that he had just taken action to " change " the law			2
meanwhile , law professors and other legal experts have come forward to say that @entity3 did not , in fact , change the law and that he has the @entity28 on his side when it comes to using executive power			1
conservative critics are wrong that he went so far as to " change " the law , and @entity3 was wrong to agree with them			1
other critics went even further and suggested that @entity3 was n't just changing the law but actually " canceling " it			1
no president can cancel a law , or repeal a law , or strike down a law			0
only @entity149 can do that			0
but this brings us back to the " catch " in @entity3 's executive action			1
those of us who have interviewed @entity26 recipients and studied how that program works will find it difficult to take seriously the concerns raised by critics who are unfamiliar with the subject matter			2
you see , while the administration has n't yet released the procedures for applying for @entity74 , @entity163 officials have said that the new program will be modeled on @entity26			1
this means that qualifying for this temporary reprieve from deportation wo n't be a walk in the park			0
here 's what happens under @entity26 : the first thing that an undocumented immigrant must do is contact the friendly neighborhood office of @entity177 and declare that he or she is in the country illegally			2
immigrants who do that are then subjected to background checks and fingerprinted			0
files are created with their names on them , where the government will keep their home addresses , the names of their employers , if any , the names of everyone else who lives in their houses , etc. then each application is considered by @entity177 officials , and either approved or denied			0
if the application is approved , under @entity26 the immigrant could remain in the @entity33 for three years -- unless the policy is rescinded by a future president			2
if it is denied , there is no appeal and the government has all of the immigrant 's personal information			0
so much for staying in the shadows			0
so tell me again how @entity3 is " canceling " existing immigration law			1
if that is the case , then how it is that the whole process for obtaining deferred action for @entity26 -- and likely for @entity74 too -- begins with undocumented immigrants , in essence , surrendering to authorities ? if immigration law is really no longer in effect , why do these people have to bother turning themselves in at all , getting fingerprinted and all the rest ? also , if immigration law is really being repealed , then under what authority will immigration agents be deciding the fate of @entity74 applicants ? in fact , if the immigration law is canceled , would n't these agents be out of a job ? after all , once you strike down a law , it 's difficult to enforce it			1
you think all this makes for a sweet deal for the undocumented ? not exactly the free ride that @entity3 's critics think it is -- that is , if they were thinking at all .			1

@entity239 : critics can *disagree* with @entity3 immigration action , but should get facts right
he says use of executive power to defer deportations is not " changing " or " canceling " the law
he says under @entity26 , and likely @entity74 , immigrants turn selves in , risk deportation if *rejected*
@entity239 : it 's no free ride for immigrants ; conservative critics wrong to suggest it is
