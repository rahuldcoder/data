-- as far as i 'm concerned , @entity1 said everything there is to say about professional football back in 1979 when he was playing the role of a bent lineman in " @entity8			0
" @entity1 , or " @entity1 " as players and fans knew him , was something of a renegade individualist in the @entity13 and the movie 's script gave him the opportunity to unleash a rebel yell : embittered by his team 's tough loss , and by an assistant coach 's lame scolding , his character goes off on the coach , shouting at one point , " every time i call it a game , you call it a business			1
every time i call it a business , you call it a game			0
" and it 's that very dichotomy that looms even larger during @entity37 week			1
the media keep insisting there 's a game being played sunday night in @entity41			1
but all anybody really cares about is the business -- as in , the torrents of revenue being raked in from advertising ( have you seen that there are now trailers --- for the commercials ? ) , the marketing , the gambling and , of course , the partying that goes on not only in @entity54 and @entity41 in the lead - up to the @entity56 , but from sea to shining sea sunday night			0
players know it , for sureâ € ” and it continues to embody my own ambivalence about @entity66 tackle football			2
i get caught up in the game 's drama , its unexpected twists , its ongoing tension between best - laid game plans and the ever - looming potential for their disruptions			1
i get caught up , too , with the sideline rants , growls , collisions and screw - ups caught at varied speeds by the wizardry of @entity79			0
but while football 's orchestrated aggression and violence may entertain me , my family and friends -- and the rest of @entity87 € ” we 're all newly alive to the physical and mental risks these players are taking			1
how does one stay passionate about football in the face of the grim , steadily mounting number of cases involving ex-players undergoing physical and mental injury and anguish over the sport 's long - term effects ? in last sunday 's @entity101 , author @entity100 wondered whether it was immoral to watch and enjoy the @entity37 while knowing full well that playing the game has caused " catastrophic brain injury ... not as a rare and unintended consequence , but as a routine byproduct of how the game is played			1
" i 've expressed similar misgivings here about the flood of disclosures about long - term injury and the manner in which the @entity13 tried at first to either disregard or demean this peril			1
it 's not just the dementia , memory loss and other symptoms that cast shadows over the @entity13 's gaudy , golden image			1
this seems the right place to mention that @entity1 , who was so physically imposing as a player that he seemed invincible , died 10 years after " @entity8 " was made			0
he was only 39 years old and his death was attributed to an overdose of prescription pain medication			0
@entity128 , who publishes the weekly tuesday morning quarterback column for @entity131 , wrote this week that painkiller abuse " may be pro football 's next scandal			2
" over time , watching these players run into each other at top speed while imagining what their minds and lives will be like 20 years afterward could finish me off as a fan			0
so could the sheer fatigue of witnessing , year after year , the @entity13 's seemingly inexhaustible capacity for inhaling money , which only compounds its overbearing corporate culture			1
i already have little patience with the game 's ethos as articulated in such bromides as " doing whatever it takes to win " or that deathless line that the late , exalted @entity153 coach @entity152 appropriated from a @entity155 movie , " winning is n't everything , but it 's the only thing , " which even @entity152 , the man for whom the @entity159 is named , came to believe was too simplistic			2
such platitudes have made tackle football a useable , if not overused metaphor for what it 's like to work , live and , above all , prevail in modern corporate society			1
but it 's not just a metaphor			0
hard - working men such as my father found release , empathy and satisfaction watching the comparably hard work of his beloved @entity174 for decades			0
it used to be enough for he and millions of fans over the decades of professional football history to watch skilled craftsmen ply their trade , defy the odds , impose their wills , share their joy and passion			2
it 'd be nice , too , if somewhere in the hype and hysteria , we could all calm down enough to see the @entity37 in such elemental terms			2
but as near as i can tell , it 's the business that now holds an overpowering edge over the @entity192			0
and what 's worse : i ca n't tell how much longer the @entity192 itself will hold out			0
opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			2

@entity197 : @entity37 points up how @entity13 's money machine mars joy of game
he says that and *coverup* of players ' long - term injury make him ambivalent about football
some question whether it 's moral to support @entity13 , especially its overbearing corporate culture
@entity215 : can we not simply enjoy football ? @entity218 has overpowered the game
