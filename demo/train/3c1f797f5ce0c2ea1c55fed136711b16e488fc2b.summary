-- [ caution : read no further if you 're not up to date on " @entity3			1
" ] some critics have called @entity6 's first season as " @entity3 " one of the best since the series relaunched eight years ago , and it looks like it 's ready to go out with a bang			1
last week 's episode had one of the greatest twists ever for a television show that started way back in 1963			1
it wrapped up a story line involving @entity16 , a mysterious character who fans of the time traveling series had been seeing since the eighth season started			1
@entity16 was revealed as the doctor 's arch enemy , the master , having regenerated into a woman with a penchant for victorian - era fashion			1
this was just after the doctor 's companion , @entity27 , lost her boyfriend , who was in the master 's clutches			1
so how will it all end this week ? it has been an emotional , thrilling season to say the least , and @entity0 spoke to @entity34 ( @entity27 ) and @entity35 ( the master ) to get the lowdown on what to expect when the season winds down on saturday -- and of course the big question is , will @entity42 be returning for the ninth season ? @entity0 : first , i have to ask how it 's been working with this new doctor , @entity6			1
@entity34 : it seems to have been received really well , which is lovely			1
what it 's done is it just keeps catapulting the story forward			1
it 's nice because it 's never had time to settle			1
the relationship between @entity27 and the doctor this series has always been a rocky road			1
they 're still finding their way			0
but they have this history -- she 's met all incarnations of the doctor , so they 've got this bond that 's unbreakable			1
they are really strong -- it leads to some good drama			0
@entity35 : i knew @entity6 through a mutual friend , and @entity6 and i are from the same part of @entity75 in @entity76			1
i felt like we knew each other as we share a friend			0
coming from the same town , we have the same @entity82 sense of humor			0
i remember sitting to his right in the read - through eating a banana , which he liked			0
we found each other funny , and that helped with bringing fun on the day			0
@entity42 : it 's a very complicated relationship			1
it 's really intricate but [ @entity27 ] 's so weaved through each of his lives			1
it 's not a relationship you can compare to anything else , really			1
ultimately they 're best friends , kind of parent to one another , they absolutely annoy each other			0
it 's a rich , really complicated relationship that i personally love			2
in theory , it should n't work -- he 's an alien that 's been alive for 2,000 years and she 's a schoolteacher			1
across all of that , they have a really strong friendship			0
because it 's so offbeat , it 's really charming and unusual			2
somehow , they belong together			0
that 's what i really love about their relationship			2
@entity124 : finally we have an age - appropriate doctor -- i feel like i 'm in safe hands			2
i feel that he 's experienced with his age , maturity and wisdom			2
i love his attitude , his energy			0
i find him fascinating -- a multifaceted , contradictory enigma rolled into one			0
he 's like @entity135 -- he 's more rock and roll			2
@entity0 : you have both played characters with big secrets - @entity27 was " @entity142 " - have you enjoyed that ? @entity124 : it 's been great and i 'm a fan of " @entity3 " as well , i 've enjoyed all the different theories , and everyone 's different theories and ideas about who she might be			1
@entity42 : it 's great to hear the theories and keep people guessing			2
@entity35 's secret -- she 's so bonkers and absolutely brilliant -- she 's my favorite villain we 've had in the show			1
her and @entity6 are just so well matched together			0
@entity0 : do you get recognized by the fans ? @entity124 : sometimes , but hopefully i do n't much resemble @entity16 , because i do n't dress like that , thank @entity160			2
being in @entity162 dress can be difficult when you like to eat a lot of pies , and i like to eat a lot of pies			0
@entity0 : what about the world tour this past summer ? @entity42 : it was such an experience			0
@entity6 's family came and i brought my mom and dad			2
to suddenly , after all that work in @entity175 , to come out for some air , and to meet people who are so enthusiastic about the show and what they like and do n't like -- it makes you excited to go back and film some more			2
we 'd often be in a city for 30 hours			0
it was the closest we 'd ever get to being in a band -- quite a strange band			0
@entity0 : what can you tell us about what to expect in the finale ? @entity42 : it 's not what you 'd expect			1
@entity27 keeps learning how to survive -- hopefully people will cry and be surprised			1
how general is that for you ? [ @entity194 ] @entity124 : even i do n't know what 's happening			1
we have three different endings , and i have no idea what they 're going with -- i 'm just as excited as everyone else to find out how it turns out			0
@entity0 : will we know at the end of the episode if you 're returning to the show ? @entity42 : that is how it 's gon na work			2
there 's been a lot of secrets this year -- for the sake of [ executive producer ] @entity216 [ @entity217 ] 's brilliant storytelling -- it 's so good to keep people guessing			2
back to my first episode , " @entity225 , " the fact that that was a surprise ; it was good to get that shock factor			0
it 's gon na work out so much better to watch it and see what 's gon na happen			0
we 're teasing it out , basically			0
@entity0 : and finally , a fan on @entity232 asked @entity34 : given that you 've been in " captain america : the @entity237 " and " @entity3 , " would you ever play a superhero given the chance ? @entity42 : i 'm buddies with all the superheroes			1
[ @entity194 ] depending on what it was , it would be an awful lot of fun			0
@entity27 gets her share of heroic moments , and gets to do stunts			1
even though she is just a schoolteacher , i 'm getting my fair share of action stuff			0
if it 's a good story , then that 's great			0
i 'd like to do something quite theatrical -- i 'd like to do something bold and big .			0

the stakes could n't be *higher* for " @entity3 " in the season finale
the doctor 's *current* companion , @entity27 , as played by @entity34 , may not stay
@entity35 was recently revealed as *...* ( *spoiler* alert ! )
