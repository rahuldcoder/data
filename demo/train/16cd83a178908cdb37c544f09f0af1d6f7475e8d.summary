@entity0 -- @entity6 and @entity7 , the two men vying to be @entity4 's prime minister in the september 7 national election , offer contrasting views on @entity9 , the country that looms largest on @entity4 's economic and strategic horizon			1
@entity6 , the @entity9 - speaking incumbent prime minister in the @entity12 - led government , says the @entity9 resources boom is over and @entity4 needs to prepare for that transition , given how important @entity9 has become as a trade partner in the past decade			1
@entity9 is a key destination for @entity4 resources such as iron ore , coal and @entity20			2
but in recent months , even @entity9 's breakneck economic pace has hit some speed bumps			0
on the broader geopolitical front , @entity6 wants @entity9 and the @entity24 to carve out a new @entity26 " strategic road - map " that will enhance trade , investment and security in the region			1

" but he notes that @entity4 's friendship with @entity9 is more recent than that with @entity40 , and less developed than that with the @entity24			1
in a major policy speech to a business audience in @entity43 last year , @entity7 said he believed it would take time before @entity4 's ties with @entity9 approached " the warmth that we take for granted with @entity24			1
" still , he believes it is an effort worth making			0
like his mentor , former @entity4 prime minister @entity50 , @entity7 is a rock - solid supporter of @entity4 's military alliance with the @entity24 , and believes that it is possible to be friends both with @entity55 and @entity43			1
@entity50 , he said , " understood that you could make a new friend without losing an old one			0
" @entity7 said @entity4 accepted @entity9 's modernization of its armed forces and so @entity4 's strong military relationship with the @entity24 should be seen more as a means of " building trust than picking sides			1
" his objective in government would be engagement with @entity9 rather than containment , and cooperation rather than strategic competition			0
where they agree where @entity6 and @entity7 are in agreement is on the need to wrap up a free trade agreement with @entity9 that has been in the works since 2005			2
the two countries recently began their 20th round of negotiations , but differences over agriculture , investment access and intellectual property protection continue to stymie a result			0
in contrast , neighboring @entity85 signed a free trade agreement with @entity9 in 2008 and has seen its exports of meat , dairy and other foodstuffs grow significantly			0

during a visit to @entity9 in april , @entity98 , the @entity12 leader who took over when @entity6 was dumped by his own party in 2010 before she suffered the same fate at @entity6 's hands on june 26 , signed a " strategic partnership " agreement with president @entity104 that calls for annual high - level leadership meetings			1
@entity6 has already invited @entity104 to visit @entity4 next year			2
@entity7 has said that if he wins government , his first overseas trip would be to @entity109 , and his second would include @entity9			0
he has also pledged to sign a @entity9 free trade agreement within 12 months of taking office			0
but @entity7 has also expressed wariness about @entity9 state - controlled investment in @entity4			1
" @entity9 investment is complicated by the prevalence of state - owned enterprises , " he told the @entity4 @entity116 in @entity43			2
" it would rarely be in @entity4 's national interest to allow a foreign government or its agencies to control an @entity4 business			0
" in that same speech , @entity7 pushed the need for @entity9 political and legal reforms			0
" in the long term , @entity9 should prosper even more if its people enjoyed freedom under the law and the right to choose a government , despite the difficulty of managing this transition in a country with a tumultuous history , " he said			0
but whatever disagreements @entity4 had with @entity9 , @entity7 said it was important to acknowledge the vast improvement in living standards that @entity9 people had enjoyed since the 1970s			2
where @entity7 is comfortable with @entity24 primacy and policy , @entity6 argues that it is up to both @entity9 and the @entity24 to take the lead in creating a more integrated , secure and prosperous @entity26			1
@entity6 's record in @entity9 the first time @entity6 was @entity4 's prime minister ( 2007 - 2010 ) , he irritated the @entity9 leadership through his criticism of @entity9 's human rights record in @entity154 during an april 2008 speech to university students in @entity43			1
@entity6 , a lifelong student of @entity9 history and a fluent @entity159 speaker from his time as a diplomat in the @entity4 embassy in @entity43 in the 1980s , maintained he was simply speaking frankly , as befitted one of @entity9 's " zhengyou " or " true , critical friends			1
" @entity6 's enthusiasm for all things @entity9 has n't waned			2
for the last year he has been banging the drum about the need for a new @entity9 - @entity24 strategic road map -- something that may have seen its formative steps in the informal discussions between @entity24 president @entity173 and president @entity104 at @entity175 in @entity176 in early june			1
@entity6 believes that @entity104 is " a @entity9 leader that the @entity24 can do business with			2
" in a speech to foreign correspondents in @entity0 late last year , @entity6 described @entity104 as " experienced , confident and self - assured and because of his family 's political pedigree ( his father @entity183 was a @entity184 member ) , comfortable with the mantle of political leadership			0
" read more : @entity6 writes on @entity9 's leadership change certainly the @entity175 meeting between @entity173 and @entity104 looked to have increased the personal chemistry between the two leaders			2
unlike some of his predecessors , @entity104 is relaxed in an international setting and has spent considerable time in the @entity24			0
@entity6 sees a role for @entity104 that goes beyond the development of long - term @entity24 - @entity9 relations to one that involves " shaping the broad architecture of a new rules - based order for @entity202			1
" this is how @entity6 described @entity104 just before the latter 's elevation to the top job in @entity9 : " given the formidable strategic and economic challenges that lie ahead , both for @entity9 itself , and @entity9 's place in the region and the world , on balance i believe @entity104 to be the man for the times			2
" road map for @entity9 @entity6 's road map for @entity24 - @entity9 ties includes more regular meetings between the @entity24 and @entity9 presidents -- about five times a year -- and the appointment on both sides of an undisputed " point person " who would be the main channel for the relationship , in the style of @entity226 in the @entity228 era			1
for the @entity24 , that person is current national security adviser @entity229 , who replaced @entity230 on july 1			0
for @entity9 , @entity104 's top foreign policy advisor is former ambassador to the @entity24 , former foreign minister and current state councillor @entity234 , though academic and @entity184 member @entity236 is also regarded as an influential " behind the scenes " figure			2
in @entity6 's view , any @entity24 - @entity9 strategic road map for @entity202 should seek to include @entity40 and @entity9 in a new @entity241 that ideally would become a " genuine free trade area of @entity202 and the @entity243			1
" @entity6 is the first to acknowledge the difficulties in getting @entity9 and @entity40 together			0
to achieve this , he says , would require proactive political leadership from @entity43 , @entity55 and @entity247			0
for his part , @entity7 says that while @entity24 policy is not infallible , " its interventions abroad are invariably in favour of democracy and human rights , not against them			0
" because of the history and values shared by @entity4 and @entity24 , @entity7 said there were easy returns for @entity4 from the relationship with @entity55			1
but to get anything like comparable returns with @entity9 , @entity4 would have to work much harder .			0
