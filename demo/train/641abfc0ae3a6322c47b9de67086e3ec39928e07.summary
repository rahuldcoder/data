-- keeping global warming down to a level people can live with means cutting carbon emissions to " near zero " by the end of the century , even in an increasingly industrialized world , the top @entity2 experts on the issue reported sunday			1
that may be doable , but it will take " substantial investments " in everything from planting more trees to replacing fossil fuels with low - carbon power sources like solar , wind and nuclear energy , the @entity18 announced in its latest report			1
" what this report clearly shows is that the challenges to resolve the global common problem are huge , " said @entity21 , a @entity22 economist and one of the lead authors of sunday 's document			1
" but also this report shows that there are some steps to resolve this issue			2
i would say in that sense the report also outlines the challenges , but it provides hope -- modest hope			1
" @entity40 , the director of the @entity41 at the @entity42 , agreed			0
" the report shows that the scale of change require to tackle climate change is massive , but the ability to solve it is possible , " she said sunday			1
" we need to do it quickly , before it will get so expensive to respond that we may hit the points of no return			0
" little time left to turn down the world 's heat , @entity2 says ' substantial investments ' @entity21 's modest hope will require more than tripling the share of electricity produced by renewable sources or nuclear power , along with refining the still - evolving technology of capturing carbon emissions and storing them underground			1
and it will take a coordinated global effort , likely including taxes on emissions , he said			2
no direct price tag was attached to that scenario , but @entity21 said it would require " substantial investments , " and more delays just drive up the expected cost			0
the impact could amount to shaving the projected average growth of the global economy by six - hundredths of a percentage point -- from about 2 % per year to 1.94 % -- over the coming century			1
the total global economy was about $ 72 trillion in 2012 , according to @entity80 figures			2
" we are clearly arguing that achieving these goals is a huge technological and institutional challenge			0
we are not saying this is a free lunch , " @entity21 told reporters from @entity85 , where the final document was approved over the weekend			0
" climate policy is not a free lunch , " he said			2
" but climate policy could be a lunch worthwhile to buy			2
" in the @entity92 , the second - biggest producer of greenhouse gases , a boom in natural gas along with conservation efforts , more renewable energy and a steep recession combined to reduce carbon emissions by about 10 % in the last decade			2
@entity92 secretary of state @entity101 , who in february called the issue " the greatest challenge of our generation , " said sunday 's report is an economic opportunity			1
" so many of the technologies that will help us fight climate change are far cheaper , more readily available , and better performing than they were when the last @entity18 assessment was released less than a decade ago , " @entity101 said in a written statement			1
" these technologies can cut carbon pollution while growing economic opportunity at the same time			1
the global energy market represents a $ 6 trillion opportunity , with 6 billion users around the world			1
" minds must change , supporter says but addressing the issue involves more than technological changes , said @entity40 , who worked as a review editor for one of the chapters of the report			1
" it is about shift of mindsets of political leaders and business leaders to step it up and have the will to implement changes , " she said			2
despite more than two decades of efforts to restrain carbon emissions , not only are emissions still going up , they 're going up faster than ever , @entity21 said			0
though there 's been an increased emphasis on generating power from renewable sources , the use of coal has gone up in the past 10 years , he said			2
limiting the projected increase in global average temperatures to 2 degrees @entity150 ( 3.6 degrees f ) over preindustrial times will require cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases by 40 % to 70 % by 2050 " and to near zero by the end of this century , " the @entity18 concluded			2
sunday 's report is the third part of a benchmark @entity2 assessment that comes out every six years			1
the first , in september , reaffirmed the science behind the warming of the planet ; the second , at the end of march , warned that chances to limit the increase in temperatures are slipping away , with the world 's poor expected to bear the worst of the effects			1
@entity40 said it will be important to craft solutions that are fair and take care of those people who are being impacted already or soon will be			0
blueprint for national leaders the reports are aimed at guiding world leaders as the @entity2 attempts to work out a new treaty to limit emissions in 2015			1
previous rounds of talks have been strained by disputes among the biggest emitters -- @entity183 , the @entity92 and @entity184 countries -- and poorer countries whose populations could see the worst impacts first			0
about half of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere since the dawn of the industrial age has been produced since 1990 , the scientists behind sunday 's report concluded			1
on the current path , global average temperatures could go up anywhere from 3.7 to 4.8 degrees c ( 6.7 to 8.6 f ) over preindustrial levels by 2100			0
that would produce a world with higher sea levels , deeper droughts and more intense storms , along with oceans made more acidic by the absorption of carbon dioxide , with impacts on vital marine life that " we can not estimate at this point in time , " @entity18 chairman @entity200 said			0
there 's " a broad set of technologies " that could be deployed to head off that future , @entity21 said -- many of which are listed in the report			1
and the document points to potential benefits of the effort , including cleaner air and healthier populations			0
one of the most controversial is carbon capture and sequestration technology , which would reduce smokestack emissions and put the carbon dioxide in storage			0
but the technology is expensive			0
" it 's not fully proved yet in terms of being commercially viable , but it looks like it has the most promise of all , because it can be coupled with lots of sources of carbon dioxide and essentially be used to neutralize them , " said @entity231 , a report co-author and an environmental economist at @entity234			1
if paired with renewable bioenergy sources , it could lead to net negative emissions , he said			0
act now , environmentalists say other leaders of some of the world 's biggest environmental groups called the report a positive one			2
" the @entity18 is clear that acting on climate change is possible , beneficial and affordable , " said @entity253 , the head of the @entity255 's climate and energy program			1
" if we act now , costs will be only a very small fraction of global economies			0
those who say it 's too hard and too expensive are wrong			0
" she said the report should convince investors " to pull your money out of dirty fossil fuels and put it into renewable energy and energy efficiency			0
" @entity40 said individuals can also do that by seeking greener power sources and ways to save energy , and by keeping a close eye on where they invest their 401 ( k ) plans and other savings vehicles			0
she also said it would be a a challenge for her organization to make sure that people see there is still hope			0
" there is a chance that their children wo n't have to deal with this problem , " she said			0
carbon dioxide benchmark hits new heights , worries scientists opinion : is it time for international agreements to recognize national laws ? @entity0 's @entity298 contributed to this report .			1

new : @entity101 calls the report a wake - up call to an economic opportunity
new : environmentalist says political will must change too
