@entity0 -- palestinians hurled rocks and burned tires in several neighborhoods in @entity0 tuesday to protest the reopening of a landmark synagogue after more than 60 years			1

at least seven people in the @entity19 neighborhood were wounded when police fired rubber bullets			1
in all , 91 people were wounded in the clashes , the @entity2 @entity22 said			1
about 3,000 officers were deployed in the city after the militant group @entity27 declared tuesday a " @entity28			2
" the group was protesting the reopening of the @entity31 on monday			0
however , rumors swirled that right - wing groups were planning to ascend the @entity34 , where @entity35 is located			0
senior @entity27 leader @entity36 , in a speech monday in @entity38 , called on @entity2 to take to the street to protect @entity0 and its @entity41 and @entity42 shrines			1
the @entity43 suggested @entity44 was " preventing citizens from reaching the @entity46 ... to pray in @entity35 , as part of increasing provocative policies violating international law and human rights			2
" " pay no attention to malicious slander , " said rabbi @entity51 , chief rabbi of @entity44 , told the @entity55 news agency @entity54 on monday			2
" all we are doing is resurrecting the @entity31 that was destroyed 60 years ago			1
all the rumors that suggest we will later march on @entity34 are just that -- rumors			0
" however , the incident is only the latest to ratchet up tensions between @entity44 and @entity2			1
the synagogue is located in the @entity62 of @entity0 's @entity46			1
the @entity46 also includes @entity0 , seen as @entity2 as the capital of their future state			1
@entity44 claims sovereignty over all of @entity0 since it took over @entity0 and the @entity67 in 1967 in the six - day war			1
the rededication has underlined @entity2 concerns that @entity44 is attempting to bring more @entity55 into @entity0 and drive @entity2 out , particularly as it comes on the heels of an @entity44 announcement last week that 1,600 more housing units would be built in the @entity75 neighborhood of @entity0			1
the synagogue rededication , however , had been planned for months in advance , according to organizers			0
in a statement tuesday , the @entity79 said it " strongly condemns recent measures taken by @entity44 in @entity0 , the latest of which has been the inauguration of a synagogue in the old city			1
@entity79 holds @entity44 responsible for the escalation of the situation in the occupied @entity2 territory			1
" @entity44 defense minister @entity89 , meeting in @entity91 , @entity92 , with the @entity92 minister of defense , said , " @entity44 will not allow extremists to dictate and force political arrangements			2
" i have said this times before and i repeat : @entity44 is strong ... and must reach political arrangements out of this position , " @entity89 said			2
" lack of political negotiations will strengthen and encourage the extremists of both sides and the riots in @entity0 today proves so			1
a political arrangement will only be achieved by direct negotiations			0
" construction on the synagogue began in 1700 , but halted , according to the web site of @entity109 , which describes itself as an educational and travel resource			0
it was restarted in 1836 and the synagogue was completed in 1856			0
the synagogue was destroyed by the @entity112 in 1948			0
conservation and investigation of the ruins began in 1977			0
@entity36 also warned the international community that @entity44 is " playing with fire " that could lead to a regional blowup			2
speaking to reporters monday , @entity120 spokesman @entity119 said there were @entity124 concerns " about the tensions regarding the rededication of a synagogue in the jewish quarter of the @entity46			0
and we are urging all parties to act responsibly and do whatever is necessary to remain calm			0
" at a memorial service tuesday for late @entity44 prime ministers and presidents , president @entity132 said : " we can not afford to unravel the delicate fabric of friendship with the @entity124			2
" today , we are also at a decisive moment and we must decide without the determination of external parties			0
that is , decide that even in a time of threats we will not give up on peace			0
the heritage of our leaders guides us and our children as such			0
" last month , protests erupted after the @entity44 government announced it would include two @entity67 religious shrines as part of a larger list of 150 @entity154 heritage sites			2
