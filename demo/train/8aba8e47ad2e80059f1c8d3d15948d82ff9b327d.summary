@entity0 -- from rising rhetoric between the president and top republicans over the economy to a marquee @entity8 campaign showdown , politics are heating up in the summer sun and could boil over in the week ahead			1
economic tug of war with budget showdowns looming , president @entity11 continues to try to take his case directly to the @entity15 people			1
the president travels to an @entity18 distribution center in @entity19 , @entity20 , on tuesday and will again speak on the economy , which remains the top issue on the minds of @entity15			1
the @entity25 touts the address as the first in a series of policy speeches on @entity11 's " better bargain for the middle class			1
" @entity32 : @entity11 thinks he 's getting the upper hand " tuesday 's speech will focus on manufacturing and high - wage jobs for durable economic growth , and the president will discuss proposals he has laid out to jump - start private - sector job growth and make @entity15 more competitive , and will also talk about new ideas to create @entity15 jobs , " @entity25 press secretary @entity34 told reporters			1
the @entity19 address follows similar speeches last week where the president 's tone was sharper and more partisan than many had expected			2
@entity11 : i wo n't ' twiddle my thumbs ' waiting for @entity52 " if the @entity5 do n't agree with me , i want them to lay out their ideas			1
if they have got a better plan to create jobs , rebuild our infrastructure , to make sure that they have great ports all along the @entity63 , come on , let me know what your ideas are , " the president said thursday in @entity55 , @entity56			1
congressional @entity5 leaders are pushing right back at the president -- with deadlines to continue funding the federal government and raising the nation 's debt ceiling as well the date for implementing a crucial part of @entity75 on the horizon			1
@entity11 touts economic agenda ; @entity52 says he 's ' all sizzle , no steak ' " look , this president is a terrific campaigner			1
he has got a way with words , too			0
but at some point campaign season has to end and the ` working with others ' season has to begin , " @entity52 leader @entity86 said on the @entity8 floor thursday morning			1
" his speech turned out to be all sizzle and no steak , that 's assuming there 's any sizzle left after you 've reheated this thing so many times , " house speaker @entity91 chimed in later			2
with one week left before the congressional summer recess , both @entity100 and @entity5 will ramp up the rhetoric over the strong possibility of a government shutdown in the autumn			1
both sides are pointing fingers in a heated blame game , and the fight will continue into the @entity110 as the action moves to lawmakers ' home states and districts			2
@entity8 showdown begins what could ultimately be the most expensive and bitter @entity8 battle in the 2014 midterm elections formally begins tuesday when @entity120 secretary of state @entity119 kicks off her @entity100 challenge to @entity122 , who 's running for a sixth term in the @entity8			0
in a preview of how nasty things could get , @entity119 blames @entity122 for greatly contributing to the gridlock in @entity0 , saying in a video previewing her rollout that the @entity129 leader is " the biggest part of the problem			2
he 's wasted decades blocking legislation that would have helped @entity120 and our country			0
and over the last few years he 's done it for the worst possible reason -- out of spite			0
" web wars start in crucial 2014 @entity8 race even before announcing her candidacy this month , @entity119 had already come under attack , both by an internet ad put out by the @entity122 campaign that poked fun at the amount of time she was taking to make a decision , and by a @entity150 independent group that went up with an ad that called her " @entity11 's cheerleader in @entity120			1
" @entity122 is known for taking the fight to his political opponents , and he quickly welcomed @entity119 to the race by linking her to the president , who is unpopular in @entity120 , a red state in presidential elections			2
" accepting the invitation from countless @entity0 liberals to become president @entity11 's @entity120 candidate was a courageous decision by @entity119 , and i look forward to a respectful exchange of ideas , " @entity122 said in a statement this month			1
in her video , @entity119 fired back , saying , " i do n't scare easy			0
" next weekend both @entity119 and @entity122 will attend the annual @entity171 picnic in the rural western tip of @entity120			0
the picnic is famous as a traditional political gathering that attracts statewide candidates			0
also expected to attend that gathering is @entity176 , a @entity120 businessman who a few days ago formally launched a conservative primary challenge to @entity122 , adding more political fire to an already combustible race			2
conservative challenger takes on @entity122 3			2
@entity25 @entity52 to make another statement pegged to the scandal involving @entity184 targeting some political groups for special scrutiny , the @entity52 - controlled @entity182 will vote on a series of bills in the week ahead to curb the power of the @entity184 and other federal agencies			1
@entity25 majority leader @entity191 packaged 10 measures for floor votes and dubbed the final week before a monthlong summer recess as " @entity195 " week			1
republicans to make big push on oversight legislation in addition to the @entity184 , another chief target of the @entity5 legislative push is @entity75 , which the @entity25 @entity52 has continually tried to roll back			1
one bill sponsored by rep. @entity203 , @entity204 , would prohibit the @entity184 from implementing any provisions of the health care law			1
since the @entity184 is the agency that would enforce the mandate that individuals must carry health insurance , this legislation essentially hamstrings the program			2
this bill is the latest in a string of more than three dozen times @entity25 @entity5 have tried to repeal entirely or change parts of the health care law			1
@entity218 @entity217 criticized the effort , saying , " it is only fitting that @entity5 would waste the last week at work this summer voting for the 40th time to repeal the @entity75 and continue their record of no jobs bills , no budget agreement and no solutions for the middle class			1
" many republicans expressed outrage after @entity184 employee @entity230 was placed on administrative leave but is still being paid , which the current law allows			2
a @entity52 bill sponsored by rep. @entity235 , @entity236 , would change that law and allow federal agencies to suspend employees who are under investigation without pay			0
other @entity5 bills would limit bonuses for federal workers and impose a ban on any new @entity184 conferences until new changes are in place			1
one topic the @entity25 wo n't address before its five - week break is immigration reform			2
the @entity8 passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill last month , but @entity91 said instead the @entity25 will take a " step - by - step " approach but has not given any details yet on when it will vote or what specific measures will be taken up on the floor			2
scandals from coast ... it 's the tabloid political blockbuster of the summer : amid falling poll numbers and a rising " sexting " count , @entity260 mayoral candidate @entity259 had a horrible week			0
opponent : @entity259 is immature , disconnected from the truth but the former seven - term @entity100 representative , who resigned from @entity267 two years ago following a similar scandal , has so far resisted calls to end his bid for a second chance in politics			0
all eyes will be on @entity259 in the days ahead			0
will @entity259 's poll numbers continue to plunge ? will more women who had inappropriate online relationships with @entity259 speak out ? will @entity259 's wife , @entity277 , a longtime top adviser to @entity278 , continue to support her husband 's bid for political redemption ? @entity259 acknowledged sunday that campaign manager @entity282 has left his team			1
a lot of questions remain , and as of now , @entity259 's still giving answers			0
@entity259 says he has no response to @entity288 " but there 's going to reach a point fairly soon that i 'm going to say i think i 've said enough about it , and i 'm going to keep just talking about other things , " @entity259 told reporters friday			0
... to coast on the left coast , it 's a similar story as another former @entity100 congressman is facing calls to quit			0
@entity300 mayor @entity299 is dealing with an explosion of sexual harassment allegations			0
@entity299 said friday he will take a two - week hiatus for " intensive counseling			0
" his move came one day after fellow @entity100 called for his resignation			0
amid calls to resign , embattled @entity299 to enter clinic saying he had apologized to his staff , the citizens and the " women i have offended , " the mayor said , " it is simply not acceptable to explain away my conduct as the product of the standards of a different generation			0
" on thursday , the @entity318 voted 34 - 6 to ask the mayor to step down			0
seven women have said they were targets of the mayor 's advances			0
a group has begun a campaign aimed at getting more than the 100,000 signatures needed to try and recall @entity299 , who was a five - term congressman before being elected mayor last year			0
@entity1 's @entity327 , @entity328 and @entity329 contributed to this report			0
