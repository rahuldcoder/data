@entity0 -- just moments after departing @entity0 's @entity3 , as the tour bus drove past the @entity5 , @entity2 made an announcement to a handful of tourists			1
" most sadly for us , we close the doors after 42 years of service			1
today is the final run for @entity13 , " said @entity2 , a tour guide for @entity13			1
the company announced that monday would be its last day of operation			1
the company claimed unique status among tour operators in the nation 's capital by having the exclusive contract for sightseeing bus tours of @entity24			1
for many @entity13 employees , the end of the line means more than the end of a job			1
" it was just a shock , we were just stunned by it , " @entity2 , 63 , said after dropping off a group of tourists at @entity24			2
for @entity2 , giving brief history lessons to out - of - towners came easy , since growing up in the area gave him the chance to witness history firsthand			0
" i was at the @entity44 with my family to hear firsthand @entity46 deliver his ' @entity48 ' speech , " @entity2 said over the loudspeaker as the bus drove past the newly dedicated memorial to the civil rights leader			0
@entity2 became a tour guide for the company in the summer of 1972 -- when @entity13 was in its third year of business -- but he left after four years to try his luck on @entity53			1
after a 33 - year absence , he returned in 2006			0
much remains the same , he said			0
" everyone in the world is still eager to see the sights that they have only seen up to now in paintings , books and magazines			0
" according to the company 's website , @entity13 , which started operations in 1969			1
employs 300 seasonal workers and serves " upwards of 2 million riders annually			0
" the tour buses take visitors to many of the capital 's most famous sites , including the @entity44 , the @entity72 and the @entity73			1
what 's next for the company is unclear			2
" we are currently unable to provide any information regarding future tour services , " a message on the company 's website said			2
@entity2 blamed the company 's demise on the sagging economy and more competition in the area offering similar services			0
starting tuesday , wlth @entity13 no longer running , there will be no bus tours for visitors at @entity24 until a new contract is awarded through bidding that will be overseen by the @entity93			1
the cemetery covers 624 acres and has 4 million visitors a year , many of whom may find walking the sprawling hallowed grounds too difficult			0
the park service hopes to have a new tour bus company in place before the end of the year			1
" this is a bittersweet time for the ( @entity93 ) and @entity13 , as they have faithfully served the needs of millions of visitors for over 42 years , " said @entity103 , regional director of the park service 's @entity104			1
" times change , and we are ready to enter a new era for visitors to access our national parks in greater @entity0			2
" tourist @entity114 , from @entity116 , @entity117 , was visiting @entity0 for the first time and could not imagine touring the cemetery on foot			0
i mean , you have to have some mode of transportation other than your own car , " @entity114 said , sitting on the @entity13 bus as it left the cemetery			2
families with loved ones buried at @entity24 and those with disabilities will still be able to drive their own cars on the property			0
another thing that set @entity13 apart from other tour operators was the type of buses it used -- more like trams that are common at theme parks			2
the red , white and blue @entity13 trams that many @entity139 have become used to seeing came from @entity140 in @entity141			0
" they are truly relics of a whole other era , " @entity2 said just before making his final trip of the day			0
" it seemed that that operation worked so well in @entity141 that they wanted to try it out here , and that 's how it was born			0
" what was born over 40 years ago is coming to an end , but @entity2 said he 's not ready for retirement and wants to keep showing off the place where he grew up			1
" i greet the world every day , and it 's a privilege for me to show the world my hometown , " he said .			0
