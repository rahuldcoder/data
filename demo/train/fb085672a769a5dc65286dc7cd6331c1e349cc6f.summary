-- amid fierce fighting , @entity2 tv on thursday showed video of president @entity5 , the first images broadcast of him since a deadly attack on top officials a day earlier			2
the development came as rebels fought government forces in @entity13 and its suburbs and made significant attacks on strategic border points , officials said			1
half a world away at @entity18 headquarters in @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 vetoed a new @entity24 resolution aimed at halting the violence , prompting fierce criticism from the @entity27			1
the video , showing @entity5 with newly named defense minister gen. @entity29 , came amid growing speculation about @entity5 's whereabouts			2
some reports suggested he might have left the capital			0
there was nothing in the video to indicate immediately when it was taken , but @entity2 tv reported that @entity40 had taken his oath in front of @entity5			0
although @entity5 has not often appeared on television or in public events during the near 17 - month crisis gripping his country , it is unusual for a leader not to address a nation in the wake of a major bombing , and as violence rages in the capital			0
wednesday 's blast at a government building in @entity13 killed three top officials , one of whom also was the president 's brother - in - law			2
what we need to know about @entity2 at least 217 people were killed thursday , including 40 in @entity13 suburbs , 70 in @entity66 and 33 in @entity67 , the opposition @entity63 ( @entity63 ) said			1
the @entity13 suburb of @entity69 was under heavy fire thursday , according to an opposition activist			2
rebel fighters fought thursday for control of the country 's borders with @entity76 and @entity77 , with success reported in the latter			1
two main crossing points , @entity85 and @entity86 , and seven additional security posts were in the hands of the rebels , a senior @entity81 official in @entity83 province told @entity0			1
@entity77 security forces have increased their military and security presence at the border in @entity83 as a precautionary measure , the official said			1
the @entity96 and other rebels were no longer in control of a compound they had seized at the @entity76 border			1
forces attacked three to four border crossings , according to @entity104 , deputy head of the rebel @entity96			1
" there was a battle at the border crossing , @entity109 , and government forces withdrew from the new gate to an older gate , @entity104 said			1
outnumbered rebels eventually were forced to withdraw from both gates , @entity104 said			2
videos posted to @entity116 from inside a border station at the new gate showed a rebel tearing up a poster of @entity5 , while another rebel smashed portraits of the president and his father , @entity124 , who led the country until 2000			2
numerous world leaders slammed @entity5 's regime thursday and condemned @entity20 and @entity21 for vetoing the @entity24 resolution			1
@entity20 , @entity21 veto sanctions on @entity2 western countries were pushing for a resolution that threatened new sanctions if government forces do n't stop attacks against civilians			1
the resolution also called for renewing the 300 - member @entity18 observer mission for 45 days after it was suspended because of violence			1
@entity20 and @entity21 , which have major trade deals with @entity2 , have said they want more balanced resolutions that call on all sides to halt the violence			1
@entity20 said thursday 's vote should never have taken place			1
@entity20 had " very clearly and consistently explained " that it would not accept a resolution that " would open the path for pressure of sanctions and further to extend military involvement in @entity2 domestic affairs , " said @entity152 , @entity20 's ambassador to the @entity18			1
@entity160 diplomats " could have done something , anything , to promote dialogue " rather than " fan the flames of extremists , " @entity152 said			0
he described the draft resolution as " biased , " saying it threatened sanctions exclusively at the @entity2 government			0
@entity165 , @entity27 ambassador to the @entity18 , told @entity0 's " @entity169 " that the @entity27 will push other approaches to the conflict , including through the @entity168			1
" what @entity20 and @entity21 did today by vetoing a third resolution was really to slam the door , at least in the short term , on any effective action out of the @entity24 , " she said			1
she called the two countries " isolated outliers " on the issue			1
" history will judge them as having stood by a brutal dictator at the expense of his own people and at the expense of the will of the international community and the countries in the region , " @entity178 told @entity0			0
the fate of the @entity18 observer mission was unclear after the vetoes			1
competing drafts , sponsored by the @entity193 and @entity194 , are expected to be considered by the @entity24			2
they highlight the simmering differences among members			0
the @entity193 mission said its resolution will be considered friday morning			2
that draft measure extends the observer mission in @entity2 for a final period of 30 days			1
@entity20 , which backs @entity194 's resolution , wants observers to stay in the country and promote dialogue			1
western countries are concerned about the safety of observers and want one final deployment			0
see the @entity2 crisis in photos @entity21 's @entity18 ambassador , @entity213 , said his country is " highly concerned " about the violence , but thursday 's draft resolution was " seriously problematic , " because it intended to pressure only one side in the conflict			1
it would not help resolve the issue " but derail the issue from the track of political segment , " further aggravating turmoil , he argued			0
@entity2 's @entity18 ambassador , @entity225 , slammed the council for not issuing an official condemnation of wednesday 's bombing , although he noted that @entity229 , joint envoy to @entity2 for the @entity18 and the @entity230 , condemned it			1
the lack of an official condemnation by the council indicates that talk of " supporting a peaceful solution in @entity2 is but a slogan , " @entity225 argued			2
he rejected a " misleading picture " of @entity2 as a tyrannical regime killing its people and said a solution should be found through a " political process that satisfies the @entity2 people			0
" all will participate to help " establish democracy " and " free elections , " he insisted			0
the @entity244 has ruled @entity2 for more than 40 years			0
video : fighting rages around @entity13 residents trying to flee the @entity2 violence have nowhere to go because clashes are raging in most of @entity13 province , said @entity251 , a spokesman for the @entity252 of @entity13			0
" it is surrounded by tanks , and anything that moves is currently being shelled , and rockets are falling on the homes , " he said			0
@entity258 , a journalist in @entity13 with @entity260 tv network @entity259 , a @entity0 affiliate , said , " one hour it can be quiet and the next hour all hell breaks loose			0
" a resident of the @entity69 neighborhood in @entity13 said he fled with his wife and two sons after an explosion shook a house next door			0
the man , who @entity0 is not identifying for security reasons , said his sister and her family joined them in @entity274 , and she described the government assault on @entity69			0
" there were tanks , helicopters , armored personnel carriers and gunshots fell like rain			0
we were terrified , " he quoted her as saying			0
the @entity96 warned them the neighborhood was " going to be a war zone			2
" @entity2 , which blames the violence on " armed terrorist groups , " said it " repelled " some groups that attempted to enter @entity2 from @entity291 on wednesday night			0
the regime said wednesday 's bombing was carried out by people " implementing foreign plots			2
" the @entity2 military issued a statement stressing its " resolution to decisively eliminating the criminal and murder gangs and chasing them out of their rotten hideouts wherever they are until clearing the homeland of their evils , " state - run news agency @entity296 said			0
anyone who thinks that targeting leaders will " twist @entity2 's arms is ' deluded , ' " the statement said , according to @entity296			2
video : @entity2 government says it will fight back the officials killed in the blast were the defense minister ; the deputy defense minister , who is the president 's brother - in - law ; and @entity5 's security adviser and assistant vice president , state tv reported			0
the @entity96 's @entity104 said the attack was coordinated by rebel brigades			1
but some other rebel commanders say it 's unclear who was behind the attack			0
since the crisis began in march 2011 , the @entity18 estimates , more than 10,000 people have been killed in the violence ; the opposition @entity63 estimates that more than 16,000 have died			2
@entity0 can not independently confirm reports of violence in the nation because the government restricts access by foreign journalists			0
attack threatens @entity2 president 's grip on power @entity0 's @entity342 , @entity343 , @entity344 ; @entity345 , @entity346 and @entity347 contributed to this report .			0
