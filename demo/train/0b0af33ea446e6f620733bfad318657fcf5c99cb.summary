-- history is against @entity2			2
a black jockey has n't won @entity5 's most prestigious race -- the @entity6 -- for over a century			1
but in @entity2 's mind , history has already been rewritten -- we just do n't know it yet			2
" i know i 'm going to win			0
why ? because i 'm riding @entity14 , " he told @entity0 in his lilting @entity13 accent			0
" i could n't be this confident on any other horse			0
" the bookmakers appear equally assured , placing @entity2 as the second favorite to win the $ 2 million " @entity6 " -- so called for its iconic blanket of ruby - coloured flowers draped over the winner			1
@entity6 is the first race of the @entity5 @entity24 series -- followed by the @entity25 and @entity26			1
but for many , the @entity6 -- run on @entity28 ' historic dirt track -- is also a fabulous festivity , capturing the public 's imagination in a way few horse races can			1
history repeats ? if @entity2 's prediction is right , he 'll be the first black jockey to win the premier race since @entity38 took the trophy back - to - back in 1901 and 1902			1
today , look out across any @entity5 race track and you 'll likely see an ocean of white -- and increasingly @entity44 -- jockeys at the helm			2
but turn back the clock 150 years and @entity47 ruled the field -- when the @entity6 first launched in 1875 , 13 of the 15 jockeys were black			1
much like the @entity51 today , black athletes dominated horse racing for the next three decades , winning 15 of the first 28 derbies			1
" they were the premier horsemen in the world , " says @entity54 , author of " @entity55 , " which tells the story of champion jockey @entity38			0
" it was the first professional sport for black athletes in @entity5			2
they were at the forefront of horse racing and it was a place where they could earn a good living			0
" but the rise of @entity68 laws in the late 1880s -- segregating blacks and whites -- spelled an end to the golden era of jockeys like @entity38			0
listen : @entity6 's forgotten history is rekindled they would later be replaced by successive waves of plucky immigrants ready to try their luck on the track -- from the @entity80 to @entity44 riders today			1
in 2013 , @entity2 is one of 50 black jockeys competing in the @entity5 -- out of an estimated 1,000			1
so could the 29 - year - old from the @entity84 be the one to return the trophy the original godfathers of racing ? " if someone is going to be the first @entity47 in 111 years to do it , then why not me ? " he said			1
childhood dreams the same thought ran through @entity2 's mind as a youngster watching the @entity6 on tv , from his home on the island of @entity98			1
horses were a part of life for the rural community , and as a four - year - old @entity2 would pull the animals next to cars so he could clamber on board			0
at 10 - years - old he was given his first mare , challenging other children to races on the beach and down dirt roads			0
horse - mad @entity2 would even balance his saddle on the arm of the sofa and pretend to ride it			2
" i was born riding horses -- walking came second , " he said			0
" i watched the @entity6 every year and i knew that one day i would ride in it			0
it was always my dream			0
" moving on up at 17 , he headed to the @entity5 to follow that dream , competing across the country with some success , though failing to crack into the top - ranked competitions			2
his time would come a decade later			0
in 2011 @entity2 finally found his stride , winning 124 races and notching up $ 2.8 million in prize money			0
the racing world took notice -- @entity2 got a call from famous @entity130 agent @entity129 with an offer to compete at some of the top southern @entity134 circuits			0
he need n't have asked twice			0
@entity2 packed up his family of four children and long - term girlfriend , and moved them from @entity138 to a hotel , and then a trailer , before settling into a rented house			0
he came under the tutelage of reigning @entity6 winning trainer , @entity143 , with a chance to ride the horse of his dreams -- @entity14			1
it 's little wonder @entity2 is feeling confident about this saturday 's derby -- the pair has won four of their six races together			2
expectation and dedication since winning the @entity156 last month -- the first black jockey in the 78 - year history of the race to do so -- hype has been building around the possibility @entity2 could make a repeat performance at @entity162			1
@entity134 's @entity156 is seen as an important precursor to @entity162 , with seven of its winners going on to take the " @entity6			0
" but despite the enormous expectation , @entity2 remains cool as ice : " every one of my races i approach the same way -- at the end of the day , it 's just another race			2
" he 's trained hard to reach this momentous point in his career -- he rises at 5am each morning -- and success will have nothing to do with his skin color			1
" i do n't think my win is a win for @entity47 jockeys -- every one of us has to earn the respect of our trainers , " @entity2 said			1
" the next black jockey is n't going to ride in the @entity6 because of me -- it 's going to be down to them			1

@entity5 's most prestigious horse race -- the @entity6 -- is run saturday
@entity2 is *adamant* he will be first black jockey in 111 years to win
@entity47 riders used to dominate the sport , winning 15 of first 28 @entity191
@entity193 says success will have nothing to do with skin color
