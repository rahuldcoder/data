-- for @entity2 , movie comedy is rock & roll — not just a way to make people laugh , but a way to strike a pose of scruffy defiance			1
at 45 , he 's still playing overgrown boy - men , but his characters these days are n't just emotionally stunted basket cases			2
they 're jerks and rubes and loutish vulgarians , the more hideously unpresentable the better			0
and since we 've all grown used to seeing @entity2 play these incorrigible idiots , in a sense he has to keep upping the ante			2
it 's his equivalent of playing that power chord just a little bit louder			0
watching @entity2 in " @entity34 , " his latest assault on subtlety , good taste , and other values that we critics like to trash the star for dumping on , i ca n't say that i laughed a lot ( though when i did laugh , it was big and loud )			2
but on some level i marveled at the conviction that @entity2 pours into playing a character like @entity40 , a boneheaded , loud - mouthed alcoholic loser from @entity42			1
wearing his hair in a greasy ' 80s shag , @entity2 does n't phone it in			2
he delivers every single line with the unspeakably annoying rasp of a rusty nail scraping on your brainpan , and he gives @entity40 what is , in a sense , a full range of moods : angry , irritated , pushy , noodgy , grasping , wheedling , whining			2
just to make sure we know what kind of role model @entity40 is , hardly a scene goes by in which he does n't have a @entity58 in his hand , and the vulgarities , too , spew out of him like beery foam			0
a lot of actors , by now , have learned to do a @entity42 accent , but @entity2 gets something else : the blinkered , bellowing high dudgeon of a certain kind of in - your - face leech whom you can still find hovering in @entity42 sports bars			1
he makes @entity40 the @entity73 from hell			0
long ago , @entity40 enjoyed a moment of tabloid infamy			0
back in 1984 , when he was just a teenager in gold chains , he got seduced by his sexpot high - school teacher , and when it came out that they were sleeping together , the scandal of it all made national headlines			1
the teacher , sent to prison for statutory rape , even had @entity40 's baby , whom @entity40 named @entity88 and ( once he turned 18 ) raised as a single parent			1
but he was such a dismal father that his son disowned him			0
he also renamed himself @entity91			0
as an adult , @entity91 is played by @entity93 as a persnickety hedge - fund manager about to be married to a stuck - up @entity96 princess ( @entity95 )			1
and that , of course , is when @entity40 comes crashing back into his life			0
" @entity34 " is one of those comedies about a walking irritant , like @entity103 ? , in which the joke — ultimately spun off from @entity105 — is that the mild , ordinary guy at the center of everything keeps trying to distance himself from the pest who has arrived to ruin his life , but everyone around him ... adores the pest ! the more @entity40 disgraces himself , the more he makes the kind of cringe - worthy sexual jokes that @entity117 would have turned up his nose at , the more everyone in @entity91 's circle thinks he 's the life of the party			1
i only wish it were a fresher party			0
@entity40 wins everyone over , for instance , by reviving '' wassup ! '' as a catch phrase			0
seriously ? that 's what @entity2 now regards as a mischievous joke ? still , for a while , @entity93 makes a good squirmer			1
his @entity91 is so neurotically nice that he does n't even experience his own exasperation , even as we see the steam coming out of his ears			0
where @entity2 compromises his whole comedy - as - rock - & - roll thing is that he 's so into making @entity40 a big teddy bear inside , a guy who just wants to bond with his son , that the movie starts to lose its edge			1
it also stretches out far too long			0
( did it really need to clock in at nearly two hours ? ) @entity40 takes @entity91 and his friends out for a bachelor party , and it 's on this voyage into the night that @entity91 begins to lose his inhibitions and get won over to the ways of excess — to the @entity153			1
big mistake ! lots of jokes about strippers and happy endings follow , and @entity91 gets so unhinged that he barfs all over his fiancée 's wedding dress			2
the movie was a lot funnier when @entity40 and @entity91 were foils			1
of course , never underestimate the importance of guy - on - guy sentimentality in the @entity2 universe			2
it 's his way of making his fans feel as if he 's high - fiving them , or maybe giving them a group hug			1
but @entity2 , bottom line , is too good at playing louts like @entity40 to spend this much energy getting us to like them			1
