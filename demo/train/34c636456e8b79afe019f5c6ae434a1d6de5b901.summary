-- the seeds just ca n't stop tumbling out of @entity2 and on monday it was the turn of world @entity4 and five - time champion @entity6 to experience that sinking feeling			1
the @entity8 crashed out of the grass court grand slam in the last - 16 following a shock defeat by @entity13 's @entity12 -- her first reverse in 35 matches			1
favorite for the title , @entity6 lost the opening set 6 - 2 before roaring back to level a pulsating contest by taking the second 6 - 1			1
but @entity12 , seeded 23rd at the tournament , produced one of the greatest performances of her career , coming from a break down to take the final set 6 - 4 and send shockwaves through tennis			2
after knocking out the defending champion , the 23 - year - old @entity13 burst into tears of joy when addressing the media for the first time			1
" i am still shaking , i am so happy , " she told the @entity34			0
" @entity6 played a fantastic match , she is such a tough opponent			0
it is an amazing feeling to win this match			0
" this is such a special place for me and the crowd were brilliant to me			0
i gave it everything i had , i fought for every single point to try to win it somehow			0
" a @entity2 semifinalist in 2011 , @entity12 will play @entity45 's @entity44 for a place in the last four			1
the @entity13 has never gone past the fourth round at any grand slam outside of @entity2 but she has an impressive record at the @entity50 , having reached the quarterfinals three times , and a curious one as well			1
for she has beaten the reigning @entity54 champion at all four of her last @entity2 championships			2
since she missed the 2010 edition through injury , the run starts in 2009 when she beat @entity59 , a success that has now been followed by defeats of @entity62 in 2011 , @entity63 the following year and @entity6 herself on monday			2
in a tournament packed with shocks , the dethroning of 16 - time grand slam winner @entity6 is arguably the greatest of all -- despite the defeats for @entity69 and @entity70 in the opening rounds last week			1
the win was all the more surprising given that the powerful @entity8 bounced back so strongly from losing the first set that she won nine consecutive games on the way to taking a 3 - 0 lead in the deciding set			0
but @entity12 broke back and even though @entity6 responded in similar style , the @entity13 once again overcame the @entity8 's serve to level the set at 4 - 4			1
after the match had gone past the two - hour mark , @entity12 earned her first match point and after that went begging she made no mistake for the second to claim surely her greatest win to date			2
@entity6 ' remarkable twelve months - a spell where she won the @entity2 , @entity86 , @entity54 and @entity88 titles - was finally at an end however and she was quick to praise her opponent			1
" it 's not a shock , " the 31 - year - old said			0
" she plays really good on grass			0
for me any loss is extremely tough to overcome			0
i just have to go back to the drawing board and figure out a way to win those matches			0
" the last time @entity6 lost a match on court was when she was beaten in the final of the @entity103 by @entity104 on 17 february			2
@entity12 will face @entity44 after the @entity45 ended @entity106 's dream of becoming the first @entity107 to reach the quarterfinals at @entity2 in 29 years			1
the 19 - year - old was the first @entity110 woman to reach the second week at @entity2 since 1998 but left the court in tears after being beaten 7 - 6 7 - 5			2
should @entity44 reach her first grand slam semifinal , she will meet either @entity114 , last year 's runner - up , or @entity62 in the semifinals			0
the fourth seed from @entity118 overcame @entity120 's @entity119 4 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 3 while the @entity122 sixth seed demolished @entity124 11th seed @entity125 6 - 2 6 - 0 in just 55 minutes			0
looking to win her second grand slam after her @entity54 title two years ago , @entity62 has reached the quarterfinals for the third time at @entity2 and is seeking her maiden semifinal appearance			1
few would have predicted that @entity131 would be the last @entity8 left standing in both singles draws but after her 4 - 6 7 - 5 6 - 1 defeat of @entity135 youngster @entity134 , the 20 - year - old is through to the @entity2 quarterfinals for the first time			1
the 17th seed will meet the 15th seed after @entity141 , the beaten finalist in 2007 , defeated @entity124 's @entity142 in straight sets			0
in the remaining quarterfinal , 2011 @entity2 winner @entity144 will face @entity147 's @entity146 .			2

@entity6 suffers shock defeat in last - 16 of @entity2
@entity6 beaten by @entity13 's @entity12 in three sets
@entity4 and five - time @entity2 champion had been favorite for title
@entity12 , seeded 23 , reached semifinal in 2011
