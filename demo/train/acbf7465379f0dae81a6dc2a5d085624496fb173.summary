-- when @entity2 missed a six - foot putt last year , it cost him a coveted place at the masters			1
the @entity7 golfer made up for it on sunday , clinching the last spot in the field for @entity11 next week after snatching his first @entity13 victory in 156 starts at the @entity15			1
while his lip - out at the @entity17 in august denied him a spot at the @entity19 , which guarantees entry to the following year 's opening major , this time the 33 - year - old made sure in dramatic style			1
he drained a 46 - foot birdie putt to force a playoff with longtime leader @entity26 , and then sunk a 42 - yard chip on the first extra hole while the @entity29 could not match it from the greenside bunker			1
@entity2 will make his @entity32 debut alongside fellow @entity7 @entity33 , who last week clinched entry when he caught @entity26 with nine holes to play at the @entity36 and also went on to win his first @entity13 title			1
that makes four winners from the @entity41 continent this year , with @entity42 having won the @entity43 in february and @entity44 the @entity45 last month			0
compatriot @entity46 , who will be defending his @entity32 crown , was third at the @entity48 the week after @entity44 's win after blowing a big lead on the final day			2
@entity2 shot 66 while @entity26 -- who blew a four - stroke overnight lead -- carded 72 as both finished on 15 - under 273			1
@entity55 's @entity54 was two shots back after a 70 , with @entity57 fourth ahead of fellow @entity29 @entity58 and @entity59			0
former world no. 1 @entity60 showed form ahead of @entity11 with a seven - under - par 65 that left him tied for seventh in a group including fellow two - time major winner @entity65 of @entity66 , who closed with 70			2
" i wanted to shoot something in the 60s at least today to give me some positive vibes going into @entity11 , " @entity60 said			0
" i could n't be in a better mood getting on the plane and heading over ( to @entity11 ) tonight			0
" @entity29 veteran @entity72 confirmed his fitness ahead of his bid for a fourth @entity75 at @entity11 as he finished tied for 12th after a final - round 71 , alongside former world no. 1 @entity76 and 2003 @entity78 champion @entity77			2
" i 'm a little nervous heading into next week , " said @entity72 , yet to win in 2014 and battling injury setbacks			0
" i have n't had the results , i have n't been in contention , i have n't won this year , so i 'm certainly nervous about my chances , but it 's my favorite week of the year			0
" @entity66 's @entity84 , the @entity84 winner , was tied for 19th .			0
