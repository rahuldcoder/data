editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity3 strategist , is a political contributor for @entity5			1
she also is the chairwoman of the @entity7 's @entity6 , an adjunct professor at @entity9 and founder of @entity11 , a @entity13 - based political consulting firm			1
@entity2 , who was the campaign manager for the @entity16 - @entity15 ticket in 2000 , wrote " cooking with grease : stirring the @entity18 in @entity19 , " a memoir about her life in politics			1
@entity2 tells those in losing campaigns it will take weeks to readjust and for the world to appear normal			1
( @entity5 ) -- as someone who knows from experience , i write this open letter to all staff members , volunteers and supporters of candidates who lost last tuesday			1
no matter how much it hurts to lose a campaign , know that this , too , shall pass			1
the campaign is finally over , and you are exhausted and ready to transition to your new life or careers			1
but before you clean off your desk and throw away everything in the back seat of your car and the apartment you rented during the campaign , take a moment			1
shake the hand of someone with whom you worked			1
e-mail a thank - you note to a person who helped get you through this long political season			1
in other words , exhale			1
campaigns are not for the fainthearted			1
they are tough -- mentally , physically and spiritually			1
once a campaign ends , an emptiness comes over you			1
you find yourself struggling to figure out how to become human again			1
suddenly , you 're going to the grocery store , reading the entire newspaper instead of the clips , and , yes , speaking in complete sentences , not sound bites or barked replies			2
i know what it 's like to lose a presidential campaign or two or three			1
no matter how close the results ( @entity74 ) or wide the blowout ( @entity77 - @entity76 and @entity79 - @entity78 ) , you 're in a state of emotional disrepair and in need of a home - cooked meal			2
think about the nonstop pace that you thrived in but would crush less hardy individuals			2
you lived for and met multiple deadlines			2
you essentially lived with the people you work with and , @entity90 bless you , you did n't kill them , though you probably picked up a few bad habits and gained more than a few unwanted pounds			1
now you 're sitting at that desk and trying to figure out what to do with everything you 've accumulated throughout the quest to reach the city hall , the statehouse , @entity99 or the @entity100			2
no matter how hard you try to contain it , you 're both angry and sad			2
try not to vent and point fingers			2
it only creates wounds , mostly self - inflicted , and worse , the candidate you believed in and gave your all for does n't deserve it			2
just thinking back to 2000 still gets me upset			2
once the @entity108 ruled and @entity16 made his concession speech , i remember feeling lost and disillusioned			2
i was empty inside as if someone had used a vacuum cleaner and sucked out every bit of my passion for politics and public service			2
i had no idea what to do with my life			2
nobody seemed interested in hiring me ; the taint from losing closed every door on which i knocked			2
for a while , i was convinced i would never be accepted again as a political operative			1
i had no life beyond politics and no idea how to spend my days or evenings			2
i did n't have a dog back then			0
it was hard listening to the opposition announce members of the transition team who had just spent months beating us over the head			0
worse , it was hard to go back to a house i had not lived in for almost a year			0
in fact , i have not unpacked some boxes from my life in @entity140			0
it 's still too painful			1
i had no energy to start looking for work			1
i was obsessed with those chads : hanging , swinging and , my favorite , pregnant			0
above all else , i did not want to quit fighting			0
i was angry over the election and the recount			0
soon , i realized the world was going to move on , and i would be stuck in the past			0
the only people who understood my mood were former colleagues			1
it 's like the death of someone close to you , except there 's no funeral to help bring closure , just more election analysis and pundits spewing out what you did wrong			1
it will take you weeks to readjust and for the world to appear normal			0
let it be a period of self - reflection and trying to answer the unanswerable " what ifs			0
" but then let it go			0
in a world of nonstop campaigning , the next season starts now			0
rent videos and catch up on the movies you missed			0
do n't read the front section of the newspaper -- they are full of the other campaign right now			1
pick up a copy of @entity185 or @entity186 instead			0
turn off cable and switch to the @entity188 -- snakes and flies are healthier than exit polls and demographic trend lines			0
above all , call your family			0
get back in touch with friends who do n't do politics for a living			0
remember why you made the decision to give up your life in the first place			0
and remember this -- you 're one of the lucky few			0
you were on a team that made the effort			1
you fought the good fight			0
and you had a front - row seat to history			0
so forget wearing the loser label			0
the next team will snatch you up			0
or you 'll decide to find some other adventure that fulfills your passion			0
either way , know your efforts were never in vain			0
congratulations to all the team players , the winners and nonwinners who fought gallantly until the end			0
take it from an old - timer who still loves politics : you will rise again to fight the next battle			0
so go get yourself some much needed rest and arise in a few weeks renewed with the spirit of making a difference by serving a cause greater than oneself			1
