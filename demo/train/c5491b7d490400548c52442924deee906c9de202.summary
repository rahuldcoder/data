-- the taste of success is sweet for @entity3 -- in more ways than one			1
the @entity7 tennis star is focused on completing a coveted career grand slam of titles at the @entity10 starting next week , but she already has plans for her next off - court project			1
the 25 - year - old is the world 's highest - paid female athlete due to her top - end endorsement deals , according to @entity17 , and she has another lucrative sideline in the works			1
having already designed clothes for @entity21 and luxury label @entity22 among her projects , @entity3 is planning to release a line of confectionery called " @entity27			1
" " i 'm doing everything			0
the branding and all the shapes of the candy and the gummy - bears , " she told @entity0 's @entity29			1
" and it is going to launch before the @entity35 ( in september ) , fingers crossed , so that is my next project			0
" @entity3 is big business , and she takes it seriously			1
" it 's such a different type of work to being a tennis player , working with consumers and understanding what people buy , trend reports , what 's in and what 's out , whether it 's something that is going to last for years , " she said			1
" i look at it as something that is fun for me , that is creative for me , the thought process of seeing something that is on paper or just an idea			0
you 're traveling and you see somebody wear a cross-body bag and you 're like , ' wow i love the handle on that , ' and something clicks and you put it on paper and a year later you see it in the stores for people to buy			1
" i am just fascinated by that , i think it is an amazing process and i 've been so fortunate to work with so many great people that teach me so much about different things			0
i am not a designer , i never went to school for it , but i love being creative and i love learning and understanding what works and what does n't work			0
" that attention to detail has also helped put @entity3 in a position to join an exclusive club of nine tennis players who have won all four grand slam titles , known as a " career slam , " having resurrected her fortunes in recent years after a serious shoulder injury			1
despite having once described herself as " a cow on ice " on clay , @entity3 has improved her game on the surface to the point where the world no. 2 is now a top contender to win the @entity10 and add to her @entity96 , @entity35 and @entity98 crowns			1
last year she reached the semifinals at @entity10 for the second time , and she already has two tournament wins on red dirt under her belt this season after retaining the @entity106 title last weekend			1
" the @entity10 is always a big goal of mine because i have always said it is going to be the most challenging grand slam for me to win , " she said			1
" whether it was when i called myself that cow on ice or whatever it was , but if i go there and play well and physically , i feel healthy and i feel great			2
there is no reason i ca n't win it			2
" i 've been in a couple of semifinals , i believe , last year as well			2
so , it 's really about ( whether ) i put myself in that position and win it			2
i believe in that definitely			0
" @entity3 has suffered just one defeat on clay all season -- to @entity126 in the final of the @entity128 -- and is coming into form at the right time			1
but despite her fluency on court in the past few weeks she revealed just how taxing the transition from hard courts to the much slower clay surface is every year			1
" the first few days on clay are brutal , especially with the practices ; you 're just getting your footwork down and the movement , " she said			2
" it 's so frustrating			0
i never crack rackets but those first few days i crack rackets all the time			0
i 'm like ' get me extra rackets ! ' " over the years i think the key for me is being physically stronger , where i have been able to play a match whether it 's three sets or two tough sets and recover for the next day			0
" in @entity152 one of the challenges you have is in one week you could be playing five , six matches a week then you have the next tournament coming up then a week off , then you have a grand slam			1
" the physical aspect of all that and mentally understanding that your body has to be ready for all those matches in a short period of time on clay has always been tough for me			2
" i have always recovered so much better and i move a lot better on it , so yeah it 's nicer , less rackets cracked ! " the women often suffer from comparisons to the men , with the exploits of @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 cementing this as a golden age of competition in the male arena			0
but @entity3 insists the women 's game is on an upward curve , with players like @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity126 battling it out for major honors , and a new generation of talented youngsters snapping at their heels			1
" the level of the game from the first round that you play at a women 's event is so much higher than you would see five , 10 years ago , " she explained			0
" i kind of felt that i 'd come to a tournament , take the first few matches and see it as a warmup , in a way			0
everyone in the press was saying why is it always 6 - 1 6 - 0 6 - 2 ? but now you do n't see that very often			2
" you could be facing someone in the first round that is maybe not as consistent but they are experienced , they have beaten top players before and it 's difficult			0
" i think that is why you see so much more attendances from the beginning of the week higher than you saw years ago			0
" despite perching on the shoulder of history , @entity3 insists such landmarks do not dominate her every thought , though a newfound dedication to her profession was brought into sharp focus due to a serious injury			1
" i 've played tennis since i was four years old and when you 're in a match situation -- you could be losing or you 're winning -- there are so many emotions that go into that , " she said			0
" even when i was away from the game for nine months with shoulder surgery and trying to get back , i never , never ever felt that			0
" there were so many things i did off the court , just great experiences , wonderful people , i got to work on amazing projects but nothing gave me that feeling of being in those positions where i had to pull out of a match when i was losing			2
" ( when i ) had to close it out when i did n't expect myself to win , it was such an adrenaline rush that you do n't get in many things in life			0
" whether it 's playing some small tournament in a small city in front of 2,000 people or whether it 's the finals of @entity96 where you have an amazing crowd and all that history behind it , it is really at the end of the day trying to make yourself better			0

@entity3 plans to branch out with another business venture this year
@entity7 is working on a new line of confectionery to be called " @entity27 "
on the court , the 25 - year - old is determined to win the @entity10
she can complete a career grand slam on clay at @entity10
