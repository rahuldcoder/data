-- ruthless pirates try to hijack an unarmed @entity3 ship			2
they seize the captain and , after negotiations fail , @entity5 stage a daring rescue			2
it reads like the plot of a @entity11 movie			0
and now it is one			0
the real - life events that surrounded the 2009 attempted seizure of the @entity15 inspired the film " @entity17 , " which will be released on friday			1
when asked about taking on the leading role in the film , @entity19 - winning actor @entity18 said his main focus was accurately portraying capt. @entity24 ' story			1
" i do n't want to ruin his life by , you know , turning his motivations into something they were n't , " @entity18 said earlier this month			1
that can be difficult , @entity18 said , because of " the fakery that goes on " in creating a cohesive screenplay based on real - life events			1
" when we met , i told @entity35 , i said , ' hey , look , i 'm going to say things you never said and i 'm going to be places you never were , but what i 'm going for is ... authenticity			0
' " @entity24 ' crew members say he is not the hero the film will likely present him as			1
( " if you want to shoot someone , shoot me ! " @entity18 bravely yells at one of the armed @entity48 pirates , in the movie 's trailer			1
) in reality , @entity24 ignored numerous warnings to stay farther off the coast of @entity48 , the site of dozens of hijackings , which hit their peak in 2008 and gained international attention			1
many of the @entity65 's crew members are suing the shipping company , the @entity61 shipping line @entity62 , in part because they say @entity24 deliberately sailed the ship into harm 's way to shorten the trip to @entity71 , @entity72 , and save money			1
on april 8 , 2009 , four armed @entity48 pirates boarded the @entity15 about 380 miles off the @entity48 coast			1
after failing to take control of the ship , the pirates seized @entity24 and held the captain on a small lifeboat for five days until @entity5 shot and killed three of the kidnappers and captured the fourth			0
@entity48 pirate retires before the incident , a private maritime security agency called @entity84 had sent e-mail warnings about piracy in the region to all ships in the area ; one was sent specifically to @entity24			1
each e-mail was based on information from @entity94 and @entity3 naval authorities and one urged the @entity15 to stay clear of the shipping lanes where @entity24 was heading			1
" vessels should consider maintaining a distance of more than 600 nautical miles from the @entity48 coastline , " one of the @entity84 messages advised			0
@entity24 said to @entity0 's @entity102 in 2010 and in a court deposition last year that he ignored the numerous warnings that urged him to go farther out to sea			1
accused high - ranking @entity48 pirate gets life sentences @entity24 is a witness in the lawsuit between some of the crew and the shipping company , scheduled to go to trial in december			1
when asked last year why he decided not to take the boat farther offshore , @entity24 testified , " i do n't believe 600 miles would make you safe			0
i did n't believe 1,200 miles would make you safe			0
as i told the crew , it would be a matter of when , not if ... we were always in this area			1
" after his rescue by @entity5 commandos , @entity24 was lauded as a hero and wrote a book about his ordeal , " a @entity126			0
" the publisher promoted him as a sea captain who risked his life by offering himself as a hostage " in exchange for the safety of the crew , " something @entity24 later acknowledged was a falsity spread by erroneous media reports			2
" i did n't give myself up , " he told @entity102 during his book tour in 2010			0
" i was already a hostage by then			0
" he later said , " the media made everything out to be me			0
but that 's the media			2
when i came home , i really did n't go and put myself in front of the media			0
a lot of my crew did			2
" he said the real heroes are the @entity5 and his crew , who he said stayed calm , followed orders and instincts , and prevented a tragedy			2
" they did a wonderful job , " he said			0
" it 's in the book			2
everywhere i speak , i say what a great job they did			0
