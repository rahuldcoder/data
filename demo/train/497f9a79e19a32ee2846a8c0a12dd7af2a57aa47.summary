@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 @entity3 senator and possible presidential hopeful @entity5 told @entity2 he believes that the nurse who was quarantined in @entity7 is a " hero			1
" in an interview in @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity5 said @entity9 is " someone that went abroad and was willing to literally put her life on the line in the service of her fellow man			2
" @entity9 is in a public spat with @entity7 governor @entity17 over her 65 - hour mandatory quarantine after returning from @entity19 , which she argues was unnecessary			0
there is a dispute between state officials and @entity9 about whether she was showing symptoms that required quarantine			0
@entity5 , a potential rival of @entity17 's for the @entity3 presidential nomination in 2016 , was careful not to criticize the @entity7 governor 's actions , saying he does not know all the details			1
" i can only say that at the end of the day if in fact she was showing symptoms , i know there was some dispute about whether or not those symptoms were real , but the fact that she was showing symptoms there is a public health need to address that and protect the general population , " @entity5 said			0
several leading republicans and @entity3 candidates have also called for a travel ban from @entity19 to fight the spread of @entity46 to the @entity47			1

@entity17 on possible @entity46 lawsuit : ' whatever ' " we should not be issuing new visas to citizens of those counties until such time as @entity46 in those nations have been brought under control , " @entity5 said			2
