-- no , there 's no need to remortgage the house to visit @entity4 and @entity5			1
despite a reputation for opulence and exclusivity , it 's perfectly possible to visit these dreamy islands on a limited budget -- if you make the right decisions			1
affordable accommodation glossy brochures focus on ultra-swish resorts , but @entity5 actually has a pretty wide range of accommodation options			1
you can keep lodging costs down by staying in small guesthouses and pensions ( homestays ) that are sprinkled around the islands			1
they 're nothing glam or ostentatious , just modest operations that blend perfectly into the tropical surroundings			2
at the cheaper end of the scale ( around us $ 80 a double ) , they consist of simple , local - style bungalows with cold showers and thin walls			2
upmarket versions ( plan on us $ 100 - 120 ) have lots of amenities and are more comfortable			0
@entity0 : the world 's finest freebies these options are generally excellent value , and they offer good opportunities for cultural immersion ; they 're mostly family - run operations ( which ensures your money goes straight into local pockets ) and provide much more personal , idiosyncratic experiences than hotels -- the perfect island experience			1
most pensions are in scenic locations , tucked away in greenery - cloaked hills or near the ocean			0
in the @entity56 archipelago , they feature a fab lagoon frontage -- at us $ 90 a double , how does a bungalow facing the turquoise waters of the lagoon sound ? good news , too , for those who want to spend their holiday under canvas : @entity5 has a smattering of camping options			1
do n't expect full - blown camp sites , though ; generally it 's a matter of guesthouses having areas where you can pitch your tent and have use of the facilities			1
the price ? around us $ 15 per person			0
choosing the best - value islands as much as @entity79 does n't represent @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity4 and @entity82 ( the beloved islands of tour operators ) , do n't sum up @entity5			1
there are about 30 islands ( scattered in five archipelagoes ) that have tourist facilities , which means that you 've got plenty of choice			1
tip : skip the heavily - publicized islands , such as @entity81 , which are very expensive , and consider lesser - known , off - the - radar islands , which offer greater value for money			1
a few suggestions : @entity98 ( @entity100 's little sister ) , @entity101 , @entity102 ( in the @entity103 ) , @entity104 , @entity105 ( in the @entity56 ) , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 ( in the @entity109 ) , @entity110 , and @entity111 ( in the @entity112 )			0
@entity0 : how to plan the perfect destination wedding how to eat cheaply it 's possible to eat reasonably cheaply by patronizing snack stands and getting takeaway meals like sandwiches , salads , grilled fish and meat or fish burgers			0
most pensions offer half board ( bed , breakfast and one other meal ) at around us $ 20 to us $ 30 per person ( set menu ) if you reserve in advance ( usually the day before )			1
this is a fantastic way to meet locals and sample the local cuisine at economical prices			0
self - catering can also save you a lot of money ; many pensions have well - equipped kitchens			0
fresh fish , fruits and vegetables are easily found at roadside stalls found on most major islands			2
budget - friendly ways to get around @entity4 , the domestic airline , has six island - hopping air passes offering inclusive fares to a number of islands			1
thus , you 'll save about 30 % on regular flights			2
if you 're looking for adventure and have plenty of time on your hands , boat travel is even cheaper			0
cargo vessels serve most islands on a regular basis , especially within the @entity159 and the @entity56			2
hiring a car is expensive but it 's possible to get around by bike on many islands ; distances are rarely great , the traffic is rarely heavy and the roads are rarely hilly			2
bikes can be rented for less than us $ 15 per day			0
picking the right season it helps to travel off - season : prices are generally discounted and there 's more chance of being able to bargain			0
flights are full to bursting in july and august and prices skyrocket accordingly			0
the @entity175 to @entity176 period is also particularly busy			0
the best deals can be found during the shoulder seasons -- april to june and september to november			2
