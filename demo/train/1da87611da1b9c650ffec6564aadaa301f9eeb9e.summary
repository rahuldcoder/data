two international crises are giving republicans new reasons to break out a familiar rallying cry -- secure the border -- just weeks before the midterm elections			0
a @entity8 man 's death in @entity9 from @entity10 is triggering worries that the disease could spread beyond @entity13 , while efforts by @entity15 to recruit @entity16 is stoking fears that its influence could reach into the @entity19			1
the seemingly disparate issues are gelling into a single talking point for republicans arguing that weak border security is leaving the @entity19 vulnerable			1
the most direct link came from rep. @entity25 , who is sticking by his claim that at least 10 @entity15 fighters were caught by border security officers trying to cross the @entity19 ' southern border			1
on thursday , the @entity32 @entity31 's spokesman , @entity30 , pointed to the sept. 10 arrest of four people in @entity9 who " identified themselves , while in custody , as members of a specific , known - terrorist organization			2
" he cited @entity40 information " provided internally " about those suspects ' claimed affiliations , saying they " met an individual in @entity44 who spoke their own language and assisted in the smuggling attempt			0
" @entity30 said the department 's determination that those four are n't part of @entity15 - linked groups is no surprise " because foreign nationals with terrorists associations , captured on the border , does n't really play well for an administration trying to convince the world that the border is secure			1
" however , a @entity19 government official who has reviewed the detention records said @entity25 's claims are false			1
the official said the four men are @entity65 and identified themselves as members of the @entity67 , also known as the @entity67 , whose affiliates are the chief @entity67 group fighting @entity15 in @entity69			2
the @entity67 is listed by the @entity70 as a terrorist group at the behest of @entity65 's government , which has fought against a @entity67 insurgency for years			0
but the official said the men 's links to terrorism were investigated and the @entity40 concluded they do n't pose a threat to @entity19 national security			2
substantiated or not -- and no cases of @entity10 have yet been identified in @entity82 -- linking @entity10 and @entity15 to border security is a way for @entity31 to raise an issue that president @entity86 and @entity87 had sought to keep off the table until after november 's midterm elections			1
the president delayed his announcement on a long - awaited and politically - charged executive order dealing with illegal immigration until after the elections in an effort to keep from galvanizing the conservative base and handing @entity31 candidates a new club to whack endangered @entity87			1
but the international crises dominating news cycles less than a month from the midterms are giving republicans a way to push the issue anyway			0
much of the criticism comes from @entity86 's most reliable opponents in @entity107			1
but some @entity31 candidates -- including @entity110 hopeful @entity109 -- are playing up their border security concerns on the campaign trail			1
" if people are coming in from normal channels , can you imagine what they can do through our porous border ? " @entity109 , the @entity31 challenging @entity119 sen. @entity118 , told @entity121 radio station @entity120 on thursday			1
" it 's so critically important to really use every tool , shut off every mechanism , for them and that disease and other potential diseases to come into our country , " he said , adding that @entity118 has voted against @entity31 - backed border security measures and he wants to " call sen. @entity118 out on that issue			1
" @entity133 , the @entity31 @entity134 speaker who is challenging sen. @entity135 , did just that during a debate tuesday			2
" sen. @entity135 has failed the people of @entity140 and the nation by not securing our border , " he said			0
" ladies and gentlemen , we have an @entity10 outbreak , we have bad actors who can come across the border			2
we need to seal the border and secure it			0
we need to make it very clear that blanket amnesty is not on the table and then we need to solve for the first time in decades the problem we have with immigration in this country			0
" also linking @entity10 and @entity15 to border security on thursday was @entity31 rep. @entity157 of @entity9			1
he told @entity158 that @entity86 and secretary of state @entity159 believe climate change is " more deadly to this country than @entity10 is climate change , more deadly than the @entity164 to @entity165 is climate change , " in an apparent references to @entity162 , a journalist who was beheaded by the group			2
he said the reason the @entity19 has n't yet closed its borders is that @entity87 want " everyone to feel included			0
" " countries that recognize that they have an obligation to protect their people regardless of whether or not its politically correct have done just that , " @entity157 said			0
" we used to have quarantines of serious diseases that would kill people			0
but this day in time , gee , we do n't want anybody to feel like they 're being left out , " he said			0
" so therefore some of my @entity119 friends , including this president , they want everyone to feel included			0
so let 's do n't quarantine , let 's do n't close our borders			0

@entity31 say the southern @entity19 border is vulnerable to @entity10 and @entity15 fighters
president @entity86 's administration says there 's nothing to their concerns
@entity31 rep. @entity25 and candidates @entity109 and @entity133 have pushed the issue
