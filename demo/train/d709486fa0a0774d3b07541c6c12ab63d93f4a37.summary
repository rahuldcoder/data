-- maybe it 's the cobwebs , the skulls and the creepy books , but somehow one gets the feeling that this is no ordinary library			2
in fact , it 's the inner sanctum of @entity9 , a tortured exorcist condemned to hell			1
more accurately , it 's the set of the upcoming @entity13 series " @entity9 , " and it 's based on the cult favorite " hellblazer " comics ( from @entity15 , which shares a parent company with @entity0 )			1
but " @entity9 " is n't alone : a number of upcoming new shows pull their inspiration from comics			1
just as superheroes have become a cash cow for movie studios , the comic book is now the choice source material for tv			1
there 's " @entity34 , " which premiered in 2010 and is now one of the most popular series on the small screen , and then there 's " @entity33 , " @entity31 's @entity30 prequel that debuts to high anticipation monday			1
the show follows the immediate aftermath of the death of young @entity30 's parents , which parallels the story of @entity44 ( @entity45 ) as he struggles to fight @entity47 's underworld while maintaining his ethical beliefs			1
and the place is already populated with up - and - coming supervillains , including @entity51 ( the @entity51 ) and @entity52 ( @entity52 )			2
while " @entity33 " may seem tailor - made for the hardcore @entity30 fan , 15 - year - old actress @entity53 , who fills the role of the future @entity52 , is confident all audiences will understand the show			1
no matter " if you 're a ' fanboy ' or a newcomer , it 's entertaining , " she said			2
the fans will appreciate the fresh perspective , she added , while " newcomers get to see a whole new kind of show			2
" fast track to tv success ? while @entity31 has the future @entity30 , the @entity69 has " the flash , " which is set to premiere on october 7			1
most people are at least somewhat aware of the " @entity70 , " a.k.a. @entity72 , who 'll be played in this series by @entity76			1
the previous small screen flash , @entity78 , plays the hero 's father this time around			2
with that awareness comes high expectations for the new title , but members of the cast say they 're ready to live up to the challenge			2
" everyone who is part of this production is very aware of the love for @entity70 , " said @entity87 , who plays @entity72 's love interest , @entity89 , noting that the producers are first and foremost fans of the character			2
" our series feels and looks like the comic book in a lot of ways			1
the design is so incredible			2
" as with any adaptation , for a feature film or network series , a huge hurdle can be the way the source material is interpreted and adapted on screen			1
with " @entity111 , " they 've stuck close to the comic , but with its @entity69 cousin " arrow , " another comics - based series from which " @entity111 " was spun off , there 's a more unique approach			1
so far , with the series having enjoyed two successful seasons , the risk has worked			1
the trick to getting it right , says " arrow " executive producer @entity125 , is having a deep love of the character			2
" comic books are an operatic medium , " @entity125 explained			2
" that 's harder to get right or produce			2
unless you love comics and that world , i do n't know how anyone else would do the job			1
so it starts with love of the character and the source material			0
" @entity141 , @entity142 's head of television , agreed that the secret to success with comic book heroes is a focus on people			0
" you 're invested in @entity149 and care about what happens to @entity149 , so you start from there , " he said			0
" [ ' agents of @entity153 's ' ] @entity154 gave his life , literally , for an agency he believed in , only to find out that agency was raft with corruption			0
combine that with the extraordinary , and you have something special			0
" a bonafide phenomenon with @entity164 ' announcement friday that it was picking up a " @entity166 " tv series , every major network now has a show based on comic books			1
( meanwhile , cable and others continue the trend , from @entity173 's " @entity172 " and @entity175 's possible future series " @entity180 " to @entity177 's " @entity176 " and @entity179 's " @entity178			1
" ) if " arrow " and " @entity34 " could be considered preludes to a trend , that trend is officially in full swing			0
but as with much in pop culture , the superhero adoration is cyclical , mainly because it 's a timeless story , said " @entity183 " actress @entity188			0
" it 's always interesting to see a hero 's struggle and hide behind an identity , " @entity188 said			0
back at @entity9 's inner sanctum , @entity9 himself , @entity194 , has his own theory as to why comic characters resonate			1
" it comes down to hope and heroes and people really wanting to lose themselves in a form of escapism , " he said			0
" we all want to be able to do something that we ca n't			0
" yet aside from the natural romance of heroic storylines , there 's also an economic variable			0
" [ comic books ] already have that built - in fanbase , ( so ) they 're easily adaptable , " observed @entity210 , a " @entity34 " fan - turned - actor on the show			0
" they have stories that are already established			0
i do n't blame all those shows for jumping on the train -- the fan base is already there and they 're rabid			0
" essentially , networks are launching series that have been " field tested " first , said " @entity226 " creator @entity225 , who 's now executive producer of the upcoming comics - based zombie series , the @entity69 's " @entity229			1
" " [ comic book shows ] gives studios and networks a comfort level to see something succeed in another medium and see where a story might go			0
it 's a business built on risk , " he said			0
" anything that mitigates that risk they 're eager to jump on			0
" obviously , crafting a tv series from a popular comic does n't mean an automatic sure bet			1
that built - in audience will go right out the window -- or to another channel -- if creators fail to deliver a product that lives up to fans ' stiff standards			0
@entity225 , for one , can admit to some " trepidation " of how readers of the " @entity229 " @entity15 series will react to his screen version			1
" my mom found a letter not too long ago that i wrote to @entity258 about something i found wrong with @entity149 , " he said			0
" at 13 , i was that kid berating somebody about getting the comic book wrong			0
flash forward 35 years later , and it 's all karma			0

@entity31 is premiering the @entity30 prequel " @entity33 "
the @entity69 is revealing its take on " @entity111 "
