@entity0 -- using the most unlikely of clues -- a pretzel bag -- authorities in @entity5 and the @entity6 are zeroing in on a suspected child abuser , and they are asking for the public 's help in ending the exploitation of a small girl			1
@entity12 on tuesday released five photographs of a man carefully edited from four videos in which the man sexually assaults a young girl , believed to be 7 to 9 years old			1
three of the videos , which contain a clear image of the man , are date - stamped april 14 , a fourth is dated april 27 , and all four appear to have been posted on the @entity23 several days later , on may 2			1
@entity24 discovered the videos soon thereafter and notified @entity6 authorities on may 3			2
three factors led @entity5 investigators to believe the crime occurred in the @entity6 : the background , some products visible in the video , and the man 's appearance			1
in the @entity6 , investigators with @entity36 , the law enforcement arm of @entity12 , saw a @entity38 rold gold bag for thin pretzels in the videos			1
by studying @entity38 web sites , they learned that @entity43 pretzels are packaged differently within the @entity6 and @entity44			2
@entity12 investigators believe the bag in the video is exclusively distributed in the @entity6			1
with leads coming to an end , the investigators are asking the public for help in identifying the man			0
" we kind of hit a wall in this investigation			0
without the public 's help , we may not be able ( to find the man ) and more importantly stop the ongoing abuse of this victim , " said @entity56 , a special agent with @entity12 's @entity57 , @entity58			2
publication of the man 's photo " will greatly increase our chances of locating this individual , " said special agent @entity64			0
" since the videos were created so recently , we feel there 's a child in danger right now			0
" @entity56 and @entity64 say investigators routinely identify both technical and visual clues in videos for evidence to identify criminals and to rescue victims			0
@entity36 is asking anyone with information about this man to contact the agency immediately by calling the @entity84 at 866 - 347 - 2423 or completing an online tip form at @entity86			0
tips remain anonymous , @entity12 said , and individuals should not attempt to apprehend the suspect			2
@entity12 filed a criminal complaint in the @entity91 of @entity0 on friday , charging the man in the photos , identified as a " @entity94 , " of producing , possessing and distributing child pornography .			0
