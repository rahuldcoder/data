@entity0 -- the computer hacking collective @entity3 denied that a teenager arrested this week was a key player in the group , and claimed wednesday it brought down the @entity8 government 's website			1
" @entity16 , " the group announced on @entity10 , using military slang that has been appropriated by hackers to say they have interrupted service to a website			2
the websites of the @entity8 government and presidency were failing to load wednesday morning , hours after @entity3 said it attacked them			1
it also downplayed the role in @entity3 of @entity30 , whom @entity26 media have named as the 19 - year - old hacker who was arrested in @entity29 , outside of @entity0 , on monday			1
" @entity32 is not part of @entity3 ; we house one of our many legitimate chatrooms on his @entity37 server , but that 's it , " the group tweeted			1
" clearly the @entity26 police are so desperate to catch us that they 've gone and arrested someone who is , at best , mildly associated with us			1
" the suspect remains in custody but has not yet been charged , @entity0 's @entity41 told @entity1 wednesday			2
they did not confirm his identity			0
naming suspects who have been arrested is illegal in @entity26			2
on tuesday they announced the arrest of a 19 - year - old suspected of hacking into systems and mounting denial of service attacks against " a number of international businesses and intelligence agencies			1
" a police spokesman , who declined to be named in line with custom , said the arrested man 's computers will be examined for activities related to hacks against the @entity26 's @entity63 , the @entity64 and @entity65			1
@entity65 's @entity66 went down on april 20 after what @entity65 said was a massive data breach			1
it had more than 70 million subscribers at the time			0
it began coming back online in mid-may			0
the @entity72 did not reopen until june 2			0
the company estimated the cost of that attack will total $ 171 million			0
hackers later broke into @entity78 ' website , compromising the accounts of over 1 million users , and the gaming company @entity81 , stealing nearly 1.3 million users ' details via a @entity26 subsidiary of the @entity86 company			1
@entity81 makes games for @entity66 and other gaming systems			0
the suspect 's computer will also be examined for links to @entity3 , another police spokesman told @entity1 , who also declined to be named in line with custom			1
" this link has not been established yet as it is still early days , " the spokesman said			0
@entity3 posted an irreverent denial that its leader was the one arrested			2
" seems the glorious leader of @entity3 got arrested , it 's all over now ... wait ... we 're all still here ! which poor bastard did they take down ? " they said on @entity10 several hours after the announcement of the arrest			1
@entity3 claimed recently to have attacked the @entity64 website , and took credit for hacking into the website of the @entity113 public broadcaster @entity114 and posting a fake story saying the rapper @entity116 was still alive			1
he was killed nearly 15 years ago			0
it 's unclear whether @entity3 members played a role in the @entity66 breach			1
but they have posted on their website what they claim is proprietary information from @entity78 and other @entity65 properties ' websites			1
on friday , on the occasion of their 1,000th tweet , the group posted a manifesto of sorts in which they said people , including their targets and advocates of internet freedom , should be thankful			0
" the main @entity138 argument suggests that ... our actions are causing clowns with pens to write new rules for you , " the group wrote			0
" but what if we just had n't released anything ? what if we were silent ? that would mean we would be secretly inside @entity149 affiliates right now , inside @entity114 , inside @entity65 ... watching ... abusing ...			2
" they seemed to suggest that by making their attacks public , they 'll push websites to increase security			2
they said they 're sitting on account information for 200,000 players of the online game @entity161 , but moments later said that releasing people 's information is worth doing sometimes because it 's fun			2
" yes , yes , there 's always the argument that releasing everything in full is just as evil , what with accounts being stolen and abused , but welcome to 2011 , " they wrote			0
" this is the lulz lizard era , where we do things just because we find it entertaining			0
" analysts said the group appears to be some sort of spin - off of " @entity181 , " the loose coalition of hackers that grew to prominence through their support of the whistle - blower site @entity187			0
but while @entity181 has its own set of moral codes and is largely politically motivated , @entity3 seems to be random			2
for every hack like the one on @entity114 , which the group said came out of anger over a documentary about @entity187 , there 's the cracking of porn site @entity197 -- and a subsequent public list of members ' e-mail addresses and passwords			0
@entity1 's @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 contributed to this report .			0
