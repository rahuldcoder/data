editor 's note : @entity2 is president & ceo of @entity4 , a 35 - year - old consultancy that specializes in diminishing cross-cultural biases that has worked with clients such as @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , the @entity12 and @entity13			1
he is also an adviser to the @entity14 for diversity and cultural affairs			2
@entity2 says @entity17 was right to urge @entity18 to confront diversity issues now			1
@entity20 , @entity21 ( @entity13 ) -- privilege can be a dangerous thing			1
it releases you from the task of thinking about things that others must			2
i am an @entity30 male and i am privileged			0
not on race ; but on gender , education , religion , income and many other areas			0
as a man , my authority and intellect are not second - guessed			0
as a @entity41 , my moral code is not questioned , nor am i subject to post-september 11 profiling			0
i have privilege in these areas , and i realize that this privilege creates blind spots			1
an advantage to any group creates a corresponding disadvantage to all others recently attorney general @entity17 made some statements concerning @entity18 's need to confront its racial history , and the need for @entity18 to engage in cross-racial dialogue			1
@entity17 's comments offended some and motivated others , not uncommon when dealing with the touchy issue of race			1
on confronting our history he said : " to get to the heart of this country , one must examine its racial soul			1
... in things racial we have always been and continue to be , in too many ways , essentially a nation of cowards			1
" concerning cross-racial dialogue he opined : " if we are to make progress in this area , we must ... have frank conversations about the racial matters that continue to divide us			1
" in a recent interview , president @entity76 responded by saying , @entity18 has made " enormous progress , and we should n't lose sight of that ... i think it 's fair to say that if i had been advising my attorney general , we would have used different language			1
" the president went on to say , " i think what solves racial tensions is fixing the economy , putting people to work , making sure people have health care , ensuring that every kid is learning out here			1
" they were both right ; but they were addressing two different things			0
@entity76 was talking about fixing the economy to ease racial tensions			1
@entity17 was talking about overcoming our fears to dialogue and confronting racial privilege so that we can eliminate inequities that cause the racial tensions			1
additionally , @entity17 was not saying that progress had not been made			1
he was saying that there is much yet to be done in order to fully engage and leverage the abilities of all of the nation 's human capital			1
elaborating on history , we must acknowledge that whites have been the benefactors of centuries of history that included half - truths that socially affirmed them to the detriment of all others			1
addressing this privilege will take extreme courage , for there will be many loud dissenting voices			1
for example , there has never been a discussion in @entity18 about whether we should or should not celebrate a @entity126			1
that would be an irrelevant waste of time , because white history has been the basis of practically all that we have been taught			1
being able to sit in a classroom and open history books that positively portray a plethora of people that resemble you has been , and continues to be , the exclusive historical privilege of whites			1
this privilege psychologically and economically benefits every member at every level of the advantaged category so profoundly that its members never have to question their place in society			2
and that place is on top : the expected and accepted norm			0
if you are white , consider how different life might be for you now if you had grown up from meager beginnings , while simultaneously being denigrated by a society that had denied equal access to you , your parents and every member of your race during every prior generation			2
this is the history of black @entity18 that @entity17 is saying we must understand to truly know the heart of @entity18			1
history is history , and these are the facts			2
when we choose to exclude vital portions of history , we are no longer teaching history ; we 're teaching ideology			2
and if you 're a person of color , you 're excluded			0
the classroom experience for those who are not white tends to fit the following quote by poet @entity173 : " when someone with the authority of a teacher , say , describes the world -- and you are not in it -- there is a moment of psychic disequilibrium , as if you looked into a mirror and saw nothing			2
" it 's impossible to grasp the true significance of any groups ' contributions when they are taken out of context , and told as a separate story during some isolated month			0
it 's like reading a great novel and leaving out chapters			0
what 's missing is what the late @entity194 would have called " the rest of the story			0
" @entity198 , a black man , had many breakthrough inventions utilizing the peanut			0
his contributions could sound insignificant until put into context			0
the south , as a region , made its money through agriculture , primarily cotton			0
poor crop management practices eventually damaged the soil throughout the south until it was almost impossible to successfully grow cotton anywhere in the region			0
the south needed a new cash crop -- then came the peanut			0
@entity198 @entity198 revitalized the agricultural south ; thus the financial south			0
but because we tell his story out of context , no one understands the significance of his contributions			0
@entity221 invented the light bulb , which was a tremendous invention			0
however its paper filament was only operable for short periods of time , until a black man named @entity228 contributed his invention , the carbon filament , to the project , making possible the widespread use of electric light			0
had there been no @entity228 , there would not have been a successful @entity221			0
but most history books have no mention of @entity228			2
textbooks currently teach that our great nation became a democracy in 1776			2
great nation , strong republic , yes ! democracy , no. the very foundation upon which democracy was built demanded that the political leadership be selected for the people , by a vote of the people			2
to deny this right to millions of our citizenry for no legitimate reason was to abort democracy before it was born			0
the uncomfortable and blunt truth is , the @entity18 did not legitimately become a democracy until the @entity258 made it law that no citizen could be denied the right to vote based on their race			1
until we as @entity18 change course , grow a spine , teach true history that is inclusive of all races and replace these fallacies and half - truths with reputably documented facts , our citizenry will continue to be relegated to racially segmented ideology instead of history			1
we are a great democracy , and thus ready for honest dialogue			2
the time is now , and this discussion must go beyond black and white			2
it must be inclusive of @entity277 , @entity278 , latinos and others			0
it must also go both ways			0
people of color can not only talk			0
all parties must be willing to be critiqued as well as offer criticism			0
as @entity17 said , this will be uncomfortable , but " this way we can hasten the day when we would truly become one @entity18			1
" it 's unusual when someone who is out of the norm makes his or her way into the seat of privilege , because those with whom you now share this privilege do not expect you to speak for those who do not			2
welcome to your seat mr. @entity17 , it fits you well			1
and thank you for not taking the coward 's route			0
by the way , mission accomplished			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : privilege creates blind spots that conceal the harm they do
he says whites have had a *longstanding* racial privilege in the @entity18
@entity318 : history has *largely* been written from perspective of white americans
@entity17 was right to make his " nation of cowards " speech and urge dialogue
