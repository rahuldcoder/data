less than a week later , @entity7 was removed from power with the help of the military , putting @entity1 on course for more pain			1
@entity7 still has support and his @entity15 group is likely to still have an important role in @entity1 's future			1
even prominent reform figures say the @entity15 should be part of @entity1 's future			2
but the fallout from @entity7 's removal will be felt across the region , and @entity23 warned that some of the nations that cheered @entity7 's downfall may change their view if it sparks people - power protests at home			1
@entity7 was elected president of @entity1 in 2012 but went on to push a @entity33 agenda that angered opposition liberals , @entity30 said			2

@entity7 was given two deadlines on monday			0
the opposition gave him 24 hours to quit ; the military gave him 48 hours to " meet the demands of the people			0
