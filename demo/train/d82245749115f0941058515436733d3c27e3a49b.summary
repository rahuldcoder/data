-- " the guys would say they 'd be tortured so bad , they 'd be screaming , ' tell me what you want me to say ! tell us what to say and we 'll say it ! ' they 'd agree to confirm anything @entity9 wanted			0
" the words are those of one @entity12 speaking to @entity13 - and alleging torture by @entity12 's security services against his fellow detainees			1
another man , a 22 - year - old taxi - driver , told @entity13 last year about his detention by @entity12 police : " they had whips and hit me on the legs , on the bottom of my feet , and on my back			1
when they took me down , they brought a black electric device and applied electro - shocks four or five times to my arms until it started smoking			0
" they are two of many cases documented by @entity13 in a 96 - page report on mistreatment of detainees in @entity12 entitled " work on him until he confesses : @entity41 in @entity12			1
" the report , which was published monday but compiled before the current unrest , concludes that the @entity12 security forces carry out torture and ill - treatment of detainees with impunity and the " government is failing miserably to provide victims of torture and ill - treatment effective remedy			1
" the international human rights group says those guilty of human rights abuses have little expectation or reason to fear they will be held to account			1
it cites the @entity12 government 's own figures that criminal courts convicted only six police officers of such abuses between 2006 and 2009			1
the @entity65 reported to @entity13 that 10 other officers were acquitted , and three received suspended sentences			1
the @entity68 said that it had reduced the salaries of 47 officers , suspended 17 , issued one warning and acquitted 11			0
there were at least 70 cases ( some involving more than one officer ) referred to the courts or a disciplinary tribunal during that period			0
it 's not clear how many complaints are filed each year , but @entity13 said that human rights lawyers have documented numerous incidents that never reached court			1
the @entity12 government told a @entity86 panel in november 2009 that " the @entity87 investigates every complaint it receives about torture or cruel treatment			1
" @entity0 was unable to get a response from the @entity12 government on the report			1
in the event that officers are convicted of ill - treatment , the law does not provide meaningful penalties that might represent a deterrent , @entity13 said			1
abuses are classified into three categories -- contraventions ( a fine of less than us $ 17 or 100 @entity12 pounds ) , misdemeanors ( a fine of more than us $ 17 or a jail term ) and felonies ( prison , prison with hard labor or the death penalty )			1
torture and " assault leading to death " are felonies ; cruelty and other categories of assault are classified as misdemeanors			0
according to the @entity12 penal code , any official " who deliberately resorts , in the course of duty , to cruel treatment in order to humiliate or cause physical pain to another person shall be subject to a penalty of up to one year 's imprisonment or a fine of up to @entity129 ( us $ 34 ) ]			2
" assault leading to death carries a prison sentence of three to seven years in prison , possibly with hard labor			0
" the result is an epidemic of habitual , widespread , and deliberate torture perpetrated on a regular basis by security forces against political dissidents , @entity142 allegedly engaged in terrorist activity , and ordinary citizens suspected of links to criminal activity or who simply look suspicious , " the report concludes			0
one case highlighted by @entity13 is that of @entity151 , a young businessman in @entity152 whose death prompted street protests last year against police brutality and has been a rallying cry in the current protests			1
he was accosted by police at an internet cafe because he had posted a video online allegedly showing police dividing up drugs seized in a bust			0
the son of the cafe 's owner told @entity13 : " they grabbed his head and banged it against the marble shelf			2
at this point we tried to get them outside , thinking that they wanted to arrest him , but they dragged him into the entrance of the building next door ...			0
they kicked him so hard that he fell on the stairs			0
they held him by the throat and by the hair and banged his head against the stairs			0
" an official autopsy said @entity151 died after swallowing a bag of drugs , but photographs of his body showed severe injuries			0
@entity13 says the @entity191 ( @entity192 ) is responsible for the disappearance of many people			2
" @entity192 officers will summon individuals or arrest them , after which he or she " disappears " for a period of time , usually up to two or three months ... longer - term detention occurs at @entity192 headquarters in @entity204 according to recent witness testimony and human rights groups			0
" one such detainee , according to his lawyers , was a member of the @entity209 , @entity210 , who was allegedly held blindfolded for 60 days last year			2
@entity210 told @entity13 that his interrogators warned him : " this is the biggest citadel in the @entity214 for extracting information			2
you are 35 meters below the ground in a place that nobody except the minister of interior knows about			0
" his account is consistent with the findings of a @entity224 mission to @entity12 in 2010 that found : " there is an alarming lack of judicial oversight of facilities run by @entity192 , which as such are not subject to any inspections of the kind referred to above			2
with this in mind it becomes difficult to fully ignore many reports about terrorist suspects being arrested , transferred to , and held incommunicado in what are mainly referred to as @entity192 secret underground cells			0
" in february 2010 , the @entity237 responded to accusations by @entity13 : " there is no truth to the allegations regarding the unlawful detention of some individuals inside @entity192 headquarters			2
in @entity12 law no citizen can be unlawfully detained			2
" @entity13 says the @entity12 government maintains that incidents of torture are isolated -- and the @entity250 tends to respond to accusations of torture " by denying the facts , discrediting the complainant , and pointing to training programs and internal disciplinary measures			1
" it says there is significant gap between the number of torture incidents that victims or their families document or file with prosecutors , and the very small number of complaints that prosecutors transfer to court and result in convictions			0
the @entity13 report says the offices of the public prosecutor in @entity12 " operates very much as an instrument of the executive " , despite its formal independence as a judicial body			1
" another factor contributing to impunity is the clear conflict of interest that arises when police are involved in investigating allegations of abuse within their own ranks , " it says			0
in its recommendations , @entity13 urges the @entity12 government to take steps towards ending torture and ensuring effective investigations			1
" officials at the highest levels , including the president and minister of interior , should publicly acknowledge the scope of torture in @entity12 and declare that they will tolerate neither torture nor ill - treatment			1
" and it adds : " the ministry of interior should immediately end the illegal practice of enforced disappearance and detention in @entity192 offices , and allow prosecutors to conduct unannounced visits to such sites to verify compliance			0
