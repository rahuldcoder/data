-- " when you want to know how things really work , study them when they 're coming apart			0
" that bit of wisdom from @entity7 , the brilliant @entity9 billionaire at the center of sci - fi author , @entity13 's latest novel , " @entity14			1
" @entity7 ( pronounced @entity15 - jhan ) is the morally ambiguous mastermind behind a global marketing operation , the @entity18 of trend forecasting			1
he 's a " cool hunter , " reminiscent of @entity21 with an @entity23 eye for spotting emerging underground trends			0
also returning is @entity26 , a semi-famous former singer from a 90s indie band , she 's been hired by @entity7 to uncover the identity of the designer behind the mysterious clothing brand , the @entity31			1
" @entity14 " is the final chapter in a trilogy that @entity13 began with " @entity34 " in 2003 and continued in 2007 's " @entity35			1
" the @entity37 - based caper also involves paramilitary contractors , computer hackers , base - jumping spies , black market jeans dealers and something called the @entity43			2
it 's a long way from @entity13 's 1984 award - winning debut novel , " @entity46 , " a classic which helped launch the " cyberpunk " genre			1
he 's been called a sci - fi prophet , and is credited with coining the term , " cyberspace " when the @entity54 was still largely unknown			1
mystical @entity55 in ' @entity56 ' more recently , @entity13 is n't writing so much science fiction but what he calls , " speculative fiction of the very recent past			1
" instead of an imagined future , in " @entity61 examines the present - day impact of new technologies , the current tension between the cutting edge and the mainstream and how all of it is branded , marketed and manipulated for profit			2
@entity0 recently spoke with the author ; the following is an edited transcript			2
@entity0 : " @entity14 " seems like it could take place in the very near future or an amplified present			1
does the rapid pace at which the world is changing make your job more difficult or just more interesting ? @entity13 : actually , it takes place in the year before it was published			1
literally in the year in which it was written			0
a speculative novel of the very recent past			0
historically , it will be seen as having taken place before the @entity90 / @entity89 era			0
so @entity7 's warning to @entity26 , to assume all phones in the @entity93 are tapped , will have a little sheen of prescience			2
but i 'm not really shooting for prescience			0
i 'm trying to realistically describe the inherently fantastic world we live in			0
@entity0 : you 've written about 21st - century inventions like the @entity54 , reality tv and guerilla marketing before they became part of everyday life			1
what new developments or technology trends do you find interesting right now ? @entity13 : all of those things existed before i wrote about them ; they just were n't that big a part of life yet			1
with reality tv , " cops " was running when i wrote " @entity119 , " and i knew about but had n't seen the @entity93 's " @entity116 , " likewise the @entity118 show that had inspired " @entity116			1
" so i was working with something real , but something that struck me as inherently surreal , and trying to imagine it having extremely powerful pop culture legs			0
which fortunately it turned out to have			0
my current stock of things like that is always quite small , so i try not to give them away ! @entity0 : @entity7 is one of your most memorable characters			2
for new readers , give us a little background on who he is and what role he plays in " @entity14			2
" @entity13 : @entity7 is the founding genius behind @entity140 , a global pr / ad firm			1
i originally assumed he was just a standard walk - on evil figurehead , but the other characters started falling into a weird kind of love - hate with him , and i suppose i did , too			0
i do n't always believe his explanation of our world , and i doubt he does either , but he 's definitely been a delight to work with			0
fantasy fans ready to ' @entity152 ' @entity0 : you 're a frequent user of @entity154 , how does it or other social media influence you as a writer or as a culture consumer ? @entity13 : i only know @entity154			1
the others seem too socially engineered			0
i see @entity154 as a virtual extension of " the street			1
" you can run into anybody			0
and it makes breaking news more fun			0
@entity0 : anything you 're reading , watching or listening to you 'd care to recommend ? @entity13 : i 've already entered my pre-book stage , in which i quit reading fiction			2
if i could magically see anything i want , today , it would be " @entity171 , " @entity173 's first feature horror film			0
zombie plague in @entity175 , deadpan @entity173 comedy			0
i recently saw @entity179 's brilliant staging of @entity181 's " the @entity180 , " in @entity37			0
i imagine that was my cultural high point for the year			0
@entity0 : what 's next for you ? @entity13 : i 'm edging into a new book , not a @entity7 one , and my collected nonfiction , " @entity188 " should be out fairly soon			1
out of this world heist leads to ' @entity191 ' @entity13 is the award - winning author of nine previous best - selling novels			1
his latest " @entity14 " comes out in paperback on tuesday .			2
