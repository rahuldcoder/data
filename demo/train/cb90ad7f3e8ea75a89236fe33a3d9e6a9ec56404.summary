at least one country will leave the eurozone in the next five years , according to a survey of central bank reserve managers who collectively control more than $ 8,000bn			1
the results of the poll , conducted by @entity7 , highlight the concern among some of the world 's top central bank officials ahead of the @entity13 election this weekend that is widely seen as a pivotal moment for the future of the single currency			1
@entity7 surveyed more than 80 central bank reserve managers , sovereign wealth funds and multilateral institutions with more than $ 8,000bn in assets at its annual seminar for sovereign institutions			1
the results were not weighted for assets under management			2
the central bankers and swf managers said that a break - up of the eurozone was the greatest risk to the global economy over the next 12 months			1
nearly three quarters of them said at least one country would leave the eurozone within five years			1
of those , roughly a quarter said that more than one country would drop the euro			1
their views stand in contrast to the attempts of some central banks to shore up confidence in the single currency			1
but they carry weight because the reserve managers hold significant influence over foreign exchange markets with their decisions about how to allocate their assets			2
the prospect of a eurozone break - up has unnerved investors of all types in recent months , triggering a sharp sell - off in @entity58 equities , a jump in the bond yields of peripheral eurozone governments and a slide in the value of the euro			2
the uncertainty over @entity13 's future in the eurozone -- which is coming to a head with a crucial election this weekend -- has combined with a banking crisis in @entity71 to undermine investor confidence			1
that has already prompted some sovereigns to diversify away from the euro			0
the @entity76 revealed last month that it had doubled its holdings of sterling in the first quarter of the year as it reduced its exposure to the euro			0
analysts and traders say that other reserve managers have been doing the same thing			0
the reserve managers ' caution about the future of the euro was borne out in their forecasts			0
they predicted that by the end of the year the euro would be trading between $ 1.15 and $ 1.25 , compared to a level of around $ 1.26 on thursday			0
a small minority said that the euro would no longer exist by the end of the year			0
in contrast , the central banks and swf mangers were more bullish on the prospects for gold			2
they predicted that the precious metal , together with emerging market debt , would be the best performing asset class between now and the end of the year			0
the price of gold has stagnated so far this year , as investors have grown wary of its ability to act as a haven in times of crisis			0
on thursday it was trading at $ 1,620.70 a troy ounce , up 3.5 per cent since the start of 2012 .			0
