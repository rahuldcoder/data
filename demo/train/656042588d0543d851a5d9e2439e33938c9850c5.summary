two weeks of campaigning to go			0
president @entity2 put @entity4 challenger @entity3 on the defensive on foreign policy in the final presidential debate monday night , with analysts and an immediate poll giving @entity2 the victory			1
with 15 days before the november 6 vote , the candidates now hit the road for the final sprint to @entity15 -- focusing on the handful of vital battleground states that could decade the closely contested race			1
@entity2 kicks off his " @entity25 " tour tuesday with events in @entity21 and @entity22 , where he will be joined by vice president @entity24 , while @entity3 and his running mate , rep. @entity27 , campaign in @entity28 and @entity29			1
in monday 's debate , @entity2 sought to highlight his experience after nearly four years leading the nation 's military and foreign policy efforts			1
@entity3 , a former governor with less foreign policy experience , tried to paint @entity2 as an ineffective leader even as he expressed agreement with many of the administration 's steps in @entity41 , @entity42 and other hotspots			1

analysts agreed that @entity2 won on points , but questioned if the result would have a big impact on voters and the race as a whole			0
" there 's no question debate coaches would score this one for the president , " said @entity0 chief national correspondent @entity55 , while @entity0 senior political analyst @entity62 said @entity2 " dominated the middle of the debate " and emerged as the winner			1
both @entity55 and @entity62 agreed that @entity3 avoided sounding like an overzealous advocate of military action -- which is how @entity2 and @entity67 seek to portray him			2
@entity68 , a @entity4 strategist and @entity0 contributor , conceded @entity2 " won tonight on points , no doubt about it , " but added that @entity3 showed the leadership style of a commander - in - chief to demonstrate that making a change in the @entity76 would be safe			1
a @entity0 / @entity78 poll of people who watched the debate showed 48 % favored @entity2 compared to 40 % for @entity3 , numbers barely within the margin of error range of plus - or - minus 4.5 %			1
another poll by @entity86 scored it a clear victory for @entity2			2
at the same time , the @entity0 / @entity78 poll showed viewers thought @entity3 established credibility as a leader , which former @entity76 press secretary @entity92 , a @entity4 strategist and @entity0 contributor , said was very important			1
" this is n't going to change the trajectory of the result , " @entity92 said , noting that 24 % of those questioned said the debate made them more likely to vote for @entity2 while 25 % said it nudged them toward @entity3 , and 50 % said they were not influence either way			1
the poll also reinforced a gender gap in the race , with women favoring @entity2 as a strong leader by 59 % to 39 % , while men chose @entity3 by 53 % to 43 %			1
@entity2 needs to repeat the strong support from women voters -- who comprise half the electorate -- that helped him win in 2008			0
the third and final face - to - face showdown occurred with the candidates running even in national polls and the race hinging on a handful of battleground states -- particularly @entity22 , @entity21 and @entity118			1
according to the latest polls , @entity2 has a slight lead in @entity22			0
@entity3 is ahead in @entity21 , and @entity118 is a dead heat			0
in the debate , @entity2 more than once sought to highlight @entity3 's lack of foreign policy experience			1
the president took a jab at his challenger 's world view -- paying him a backhanded compliment for his analysis of the threat of terrorism to the @entity133			2
" governor @entity3 , i 'm glad that you recognize that @entity140 is a threat , because a few months ago when you were asked what 's the biggest geopolitical threat facing @entity133 , you said @entity143 , not @entity140 ; you said @entity143 , " @entity2 said , adding that " the 1980s , they 're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because , you know , the @entity137 's been over for 20 years			1
" @entity3 countered that in that speech , he had argued @entity42 was the nation 's greatest security threat and identified @entity143 as a " geopolitical foe			0
" " attacking me is not talking about how we 're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the @entity150 , and take advantage of the opportunity there , and stem the tide of this violence , " he said			0
@entity3 added that @entity2 's foreign affairs policies have made the @entity133 less respected and more vulnerable , particularly as it relates to @entity42			1
" i think from the very beginning , one of the challenges we 've had with @entity42 is that they have looked at this administration , and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be , " @entity3 said			0
@entity3 also repeatedly tried to shift the discussion to his strongest issue -- the continued high unemployment and slow economic recovery under @entity2 -- arguing that a strong foreign policy and national defense depends on a strong economy			2
" we want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible , " @entity3 said			0
" but in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world , @entity133 must be strong			0
and for that to happen , we have to strengthen our economy here at home			0
" @entity3 also accused @entity2 of supporting policies that undermine the nation 's military preparedness			1
" @entity182 is smaller now than at any time since 1917 , " the @entity4 nominee said , also noting that " our @entity184 is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947			0
" @entity2 fired back , suggesting @entity3 " maybe has n't spent enough time looking at how our military works			2
" " you mentioned the @entity182 , for example , and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916 , " @entity2 said			0
" well , governor , we also have fewer horses and bayonets because the nature of our military has changed			0
" sarcastically noting that the @entity182 now has " these things called aircraft carriers , where planes land on them " as well as " ships that go underwater , nuclear submarines , " @entity2 concluded that " the question is not a game of ' @entity204 , ' where we 're counting ships -- it 's what are our capabilities			0
" how foreign policy hits close to home @entity3 applauded the @entity2 - approved mission that killed @entity212 and his efforts to take out other @entity140 leaders but insisted that " we ca n't kill our way out of this mess			2
" rather , he pushed for " a comprehensive strategy " to curb violent extremism in the @entity150			0
" the key that we 're going to have to pursue is a -- is a pathway to get the @entity227 world to be able to reject extremism on its own , " @entity3 said , proposing @entity133 policies to promote economic development , better education , gender equity and to help create institutions			1
however , he was unable to express any significant policy difference with @entity2 on how that would happen			0
@entity2 responded by criticizing his opponent on a host of foreign policy issues -- claiming @entity3 had favored positions that would have hurt the @entity133 or offered sometimes contradictory views			1
" what we need to do with respect to the @entity150 is strong , steady leadership -- not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map , " the president said			0
read the full debate transcript @entity3 's economic plan seeks trillions in tax cuts while increasing defense spending , which would increase the deficit , @entity2 said			1
for his part , @entity3 repeatedly shifted back to his stump speech criticism of the nation 's sluggish economic recovery under @entity2 's policies , which he says have hindered growth through high taxes and onerous regulations			1
the candidates were at odds as well about how @entity256 should ultimately respond to the continuing violence in @entity41			0
checking the candidates ' facts on foreign policy and national security talking about the need to provide those fighting @entity41 president @entity265 's forces with arms , @entity3 said the @entity67 incumbent has not done enough to curb violence that has left tens of thousands of people dead and also destabilized the region			2
" we should be playing the leadership role , " @entity3 said			0
that precipitated a quick response from @entity2 , who pointed to @entity133 efforts to organize international efforts to address the issue as well as its support for opposition factions			2
" we are making sure that those we help will be our friends ( in the future ) , " he said			0
a strong performance by @entity3 against a lackluster @entity2 in the first debate october 3 in @entity285 helped the @entity4 challenger tighten the race and even pass the president in some polls			1
where they stand : candidates and issues the president fought back to win the second debate last week in @entity296 , according to polls and pundits , setting up monday night 's showdown at @entity300 in @entity301 , @entity21 , moderated by @entity304 chief @entity256 correspondent @entity302			0
until recently , polls showed @entity2 ahead of the former governor on foreign relations issues , and the @entity3 campaign has mounted pointed attacks in an attempt to narrow the president 's advantage			1
other issues discussed in the debate included @entity42 's nuclear ambitions , @entity316 and the war in @entity318			0
both candidates pledged to support @entity320 if the jewish state comes under attack , and @entity3 backed the 2014 date set by @entity2 and @entity324 for withdrawing combat troops from @entity318			2
@entity3 has landed blows thus far in the campaign by promoting his own business background while arguing that continued high unemployment and sluggish growth showed failed policies under the president			2
@entity0 / @entity333 : ads , money and travel in a major foreign policy address on october 8 , @entity3 promoted a traditional @entity133 foreign policy dating back decades , based on exerting global influence through military and economic power			1
while the speech sought to distinguish himself from @entity2 on foreign policy , specific proposals he cited then were similar to what the administration is doing			0
@entity2 's campaign has accused @entity3 of shifting positions on foreign policy matters and mishandling a trip to @entity351 , @entity320 and @entity352 this summer when he publicly questioned @entity354 's preparedness to host the @entity355 and cited cultural differences as a reason for economic disparities between @entity320 and @entity359			2
defense : $ 2 trillion divides @entity2 and @entity3 @entity0 's @entity361 contributed to this report .			1
