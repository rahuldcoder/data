@entity0 -- there are few historical figures that can compete with @entity5 's celebrity			1
this , despite what little we actually know about him			0
other than the complex and often mysterious works of art and writings that are his legacy , what 's left today amounts to a few basic facts , and anecdotes told by 16th - century art historian @entity18			1
and yet , nearly 500 years after his death , @entity5 continues to fascinate , standing in popular culture as a totem of the supernaturally gifted individual			1
an exhibition , which opened in @entity0 this week , includes nine of @entity5 's 15 surviving paintings -- the first time so many of his paintings have been shown off together -- with an estimated insurance value of $ 2 billion			1
" the big cultural figures like @entity29 and @entity30 and @entity31 and @entity32 , they all have their cults and their ' loonies ' as i call them -- but @entity5 is in a league of his own , " he said			1
the quintessential renaissance man who was brilliant in the fields of both science and art , @entity5 is widely regarded as a genius			1
" he really was a polymath , " said art historian @entity42			2
" he worked on everything -- he studied anatomy , he studied the natural world , he saw himself as a painter - philosopher really , " he continued			0
@entity5 was born in 1452 , the illegitimate son of a @entity50 landlord and notary , on his father 's estate in @entity5			1
he was apprenticed at the workshop of @entity50 artist @entity55 when he was just a teenager			0
in 1482 , he entered into service of the @entity57 as an official painter and engineer and remained there for 17 years , during which time he created such masterpieces as the first version of " @entity63 " and the " @entity64			0
" it was also in this period that he turned to scientific studies			0
" in his mid- 30s , he starts to diversify and towards the end of his life he would have seen himself essentially as a scientist who also did a bit of painting on the side , " said @entity68 , senior curator of prints and drawings at the @entity71 in the @entity72 , which contains an extensive collection of drawings by @entity5			1
@entity5 's mechanical drawings included prototype designs for such modern contraptions as helicopters and tanks			1
but it was during his second stint in @entity50 , from 1500 to 1506 , that he painted his masterwork , the " @entity89			0
" though we are now so used to this image of the smiling noblewoman , the painting 's " startling originality , " according to @entity68 , is still visible today			0
" there 's simply nothing out there like it before , this sense of looking at an individual and yet taking the individual out of the context of her own life and presenting her as this mystical , idealized figure who stands outside of time , " he said			0
@entity5 spent his last years in @entity107 , serving as a painter , architect and engineer to the @entity111 , and died there in 1519			1
the " @entity89 , " which he brought with him to @entity107 , stayed			0
today , the portrait -- with its notoriously enigmatic smile -- remains the star attraction at the @entity116 in @entity117			0
the aura of mystery around the " @entity89 " and , indeed , the artist himself could be what draws people into the cult of @entity5 , according to @entity126 art historian @entity125			1
" even he could not explain himself completely , " she said , referring to the unfinished nature of many of his works			0
" he continued to create question marks , he always created problems , he created the curiosity to know more , " she continued			0
perhaps our best clues to who @entity5 really was are to be found in his paintings , writings and drawings			2
but as with all art , his works are open to interpretation			2
" on a religious level , i think he was a probing person -- he questions ( things ) a lot , " said monsignor @entity142 , a priest in @entity5 , where @entity5 was born and baptized			2
however , according to art historian @entity149 , the idea that @entity5 was either a divine talent or a supernatural being detracts from what we are able to read in the works themselves			1
" ( we ) no longer ( have ) an image of @entity5 that is all one piece -- a @entity159 , a magician -- but a multi-faceted @entity5 , a contradictory @entity5 , who changes ( his ) ideas , " he said			2
many of the drawings featured in the " @entity5 -- the @entity165 " are held in the @entity71 : @entity164			2

few historical figures continue to enchant like @entity5
renaissance man considered mysterious and inscrutable
*intitally* a painter , towards end of life he became a scientist
works show a questing , never *satisfied* mind , according to art historians
