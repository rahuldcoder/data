-- the 43 - year - old gunman who set fire to his apartment in suburban @entity5 and then fatally shot six people in and around the building had given authorities no reason to believe anything was amiss until friday night , police said saturday			1
" nobody seems to know why he acted the way he acted , " @entity12 spokesman @entity11 told reporters about @entity14			1
police were looking into the possibility that @entity14 -- described by some as a " quiet " man -- may have had a dispute with the building managers , who were among his victims , @entity11 said			1
but that had not been established			0
an initial check indicated that @entity14 had no criminal history and no history of irrational behavior			1
" we do n't have an explanation , " @entity11 said			1
the incident began around 6:30 p.m. friday , when callers to 911 reported that smoke was emanating from @entity35 , which @entity14 had recently rented and where he was living with his mother , @entity11 said			1
the @entity39 police spokesman said @entity14 used a flammable liquid to spread the fire			1
as the two building managers -- @entity43 and @entity44 -- ran toward the smoking apartment , @entity14 exited the apartment and shot them both several times , killing them , @entity11 said			1
@entity14 returned to his apartment balcony , shooting 10 to 20 times into the street			1
@entity53 , 33 , was returning home from work when he was struck in a parking lot across the street , @entity11 said			0
he identified the victim as a father			0
@entity14 then ran down to the third floor , kicked the door open of an apartment and fatally shot @entity63 , 69 , and @entity64 , 51 , and their 17 - year - old daughter , whose name was being withheld , @entity11 said			2
" @entity14 then ran out of the apartment , ran throughout the building firing shots at random in a very irrational fashion , " @entity11 said			2
by now , firefighters had arrived at the approximately 90 - unit building but were unable to enter the burning apartment because of the gunfire , @entity11 said			0
@entity39 police -- aided by officers from nearby police agencies -- responded in droves , with more than 100 at the building , he said			0
" our main objective at that point was to neutralize an active shooter , " he said			0
" he fired at us and we fired at him			0
" after eluding police for about three hours , @entity14 entered another apartment , where he holed himself up with two hostages and began negotiating with police , @entity11 said			1
but when the negotiations failed after about three hours , " the @entity90 unit made the decision to enter and neutralize -- and shoot -- mr. @entity14 , " @entity11 said			2
" when they entered the apartment , he resisted , he fired at them			0
there was an exchange of gunfire , he was ready to fight			0
" the officers returned the fire , and @entity14 died on the scene early saturday , @entity11 said			2
the hostages were " shaken up , " but not hurt			0
police found a 9 mm pistol and " plenty of ammo , " @entity11 said			0
