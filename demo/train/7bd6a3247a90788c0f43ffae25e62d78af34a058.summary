-- amidst reports that the @entity2 may be touting inflated numbers for sales of its @entity6 tablet -- and reports that those that do buy the device are returning it at an alarming rate -- one might jump to the conclusion that @entity13 has little to be worried about in the way of competitors to its @entity16			1
however , that would be a mistake			0
while @entity13 sold nearly 15 million @entity16 in 2010 and closed the year with 75 % market share in the tablet space , that was down from 95 % in the third quarter of 2010 , before the @entity6 went on sale			1
and regardless of whether or not the @entity6 is a hit or a dud -- @entity2 claims its return rate is actually 2 % -- a slew of better @entity28 devices are about to invade the market -- not to mention offerings from other players including @entity32 and @entity33			1
one advantage that upcoming tablets like the @entity36 have on the @entity6 is that they 'll be using @entity38 , @entity39 's operating system that 's optimized for tablets that was officially revealed on wednesday			0
believe it or not , the @entity43 tablet is running an older version of @entity28 that 's designed to run on smartphones , which essentially renders the device as an awkwardly sized @entity47 also , let us not forget recent history			1
it was less than two years ago that pundits were beginning to suggest that @entity28 was a failure			2
at the time , there were only two @entity28 smartphones on the market , despite the dozens of partners that @entity39 had announced at the launch of @entity28 in late 2007			1
to many , the features of the nascent operating system also seemed underwhelming			0
fast forward to today and @entity28 smartphones are outselling @entity60 , thanks to the multitude of manufacturers now offering devices at a variety of price points -- all the way down to free			1
@entity68 says : " if you consider where @entity28 was when it started versus how far it 's advanced in 18 months with @entity28 2.2 , you might get brain freeze			2
" all of which should signal that the tablet race is far from over			0
the next few months will see not only the introduction of the @entity36 , but also devices from manufacturers like @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			2
much like smartphones , having more than one manufacturer to choose from is one of @entity28 's big advantages , as each device offers its own unique features that consumers can weigh when making their selection			1
that 's no different in tablets , where consumers will be able to choose based on things like operating system , screen size and front - facing cameras , not to mention price			0
and price could ultimately prove a huge driver of sales of @entity16 alternatives			0
whereas @entity13 and its carrier partners , @entity101 and @entity102 , have thus far offered data plans for the @entity16 on a month - to - month basis , @entity100 is enticing customers with a $ 249 retail price when you sign a two - year data contract for the @entity6			2
while the contract-less @entity16 has its advantages , namely the ability to switch devices more than every two years , it also means you 'll need to drop at least $ 629 initially to get a 3g version of the tablet			0
meanwhile , much like we saw with netbooks , pricing is likely to drop further -- perhaps all the way to free -- as carriers look to lock in customers on their expensive new @entity122 data networks and manufacturers churn out devices with lower manufacturing costs -- something @entity78 , for example , does well			0
an @entity16 2 ( very likely ) and subsidized pricing ( less likely ) could give @entity13 another pop in the middle of this year , but make no mistake : the same tides that lifted @entity133 in the smartphone world will soon do the same with tablets			2
that 's not to say that @entity13 wo n't continue to build a huge , lucrative and ever - growing market for itself , but rather to point out the inevitability of its competitors also cashing in on the tablet craze			1
the opinions expressed here are solely those of @entity143 .			0

it 's a mistake to think @entity13 has little to be worried about in the way of competitors
a slew of better @entity28 devices are about to invade the market
