-- the @entity1 must use its global reach and immense popularity to help save a generation			1
that 's the mantra from one of the men bidding to become to the next president of the @entity9 -- @entity10			1
the legendary @entity12 pole vaulter , who won @entity15 gold and broke the world record 35 times , says sport must act now to pluck today 's youth from the clutches of health problems			1
" we need to save the generation , " @entity10 told @entity22 ahead of the start of the @entity24 in @entity25 on saturday			1
" we need to bring them to sport			1
" today they have so many different interests			2
they have so many distractions , and we see a lot of health problems : obesity , diabetes			1
" and we need to encourage them , not just to play sport in front of the tv , to use social media computers			2
we need to use this to engage them to sport , to make their lives better			2
" when we look to the age of ( our ) sport audience it 's around 50 years old ; it means we need to work in this direction			2
" @entity10 's passion is clear , as is his conviction that the outgoing president @entity55 -- who relinquishes his role in september -- has done much to encourage youth participation in sport			1
the @entity1 , which features participants aged between 14 and 18 , debuted in 2010 and is now an established part of the calendar			1
a key part of @entity10 's manifesto is using modern methods to promote sport among the younger generation			1
" we must go to the modern way , to use social media , to engage society , to engage the youth , to bring them with us to be active sportsmen , " he said			2
" this is a very important , key moment			2
this is a time not to lose a generation and president @entity55 is leaving a fantastic legacy , and financially we are very healthy			1
" it 's now time to invest , to invest in the future , to integrate the movement to different parts of society			0
to change the life of the youths , and of course to continue to build a successful @entity15 movement for the future			1
" to this end , @entity10 acknowledges the huge costs involved in staging the biggest sporting spectacle on the planet provide a significant challenge for most modern hosts			1
@entity94 's eventual spend was an estimated Â £ 9 billion ( $ 13.9 billion ) with the next host , @entity96 , setting aside $ 2.45 billion for its organizing committee and a further $ 10 billion to be spent by the government on infrastructure , according to its official website			0
@entity10 says it is vital to try and drive down costs so that the @entity103 do n't become an event that is out of reach for countries in poorer parts of the world			1
" of course the cost of the @entity103 today and for tomorrow , for the future it will be prohibitive , " he said			0
" we need to look not to exaggerate , not to expand the @entity103 when it 's become really heavy			0
" for that we try to control the size of the @entity103 , we try to control the cost of the @entity103 to make them cheaper , and more possibility for different parts of the world to get the opportunity to host the @entity103 and promote the values in different parts of the world			0
" it 's a very important issue and it will be one of the priorities for the movement			0
" another priority is to stamp out cheating in all its forms			0
athletics has been tainted by a string of doping scandals in recent weeks			0
former world champion @entity133 , from the @entity134 , and @entity136 's @entity135 tested positive for banned substances in july , along with another @entity136 sprinter -- @entity139			0
this on the back of a failed test due to a banned diuretic from @entity136 @entity15 champion @entity144 , who will also likely miss the world championships in @entity146 depending on the outcome of her case			1
@entity10 is unequivocal in his stance			1
" regarding doping , of course it 's a very sad , and very negative example , " he said			0
" and in some cases we can understand it			0
" the system , which is developing , and also the role of the international federation , of @entity159 ( @entity159 ) is getting stronger and stronger			2
i can see this positive trend			0
" we eliminate the cheaters			0
we protect the honest athletes			0
we will not keep any excuse to anyone			0
this is a very important issue			0
" in the wake of those glut of positive tests from his country , six - time @entity15 champion @entity167 was quick to declare himself clean			1
and @entity10 says the fastest man alive sets a perfect example for others to follow			1
" @entity167 is an amazing athlete , it 's unbelievable talent , " he said			0
" for myself , i first saw him compete in 2002 in @entity179 and already at that time i realized this is a future great , great champion			0
" and of course for sport in general , and of course for athletics , he 's very , very respected , and a very big champion and star			2
this is a really good model to promote sport and get used to follow good example			2
