-- the horrific loss of life from the three week conflict in @entity4 can never be valued -- but the economic fallout from war is also devastating the local population			1
in the case of @entity4 , a seven year air and sea blockage imposed by @entity11 since @entity12 came to power has isolated its economy			1
the blockade has limited supplies of concrete and basic construction materials as well as medical supplies and food stuffs			0
according to the @entity22 , half of @entity4 's 1.8 million residents live in poverty and one out of every three workers is unemployed			2
as @entity4 's official economy has contracted , the shadow economy -- also known as the tunnel economy -- blossomed			1
underground tunnels were built by @entity30 to circumvent the blockade allowing goods to be illegally smuggled from @entity33			1
but the tunnels have also been used by @entity12 to bring in weapons and launch attacks on @entity11			1
@entity0 's @entity37 sat down @entity39 strategist @entity38 to ask what could reverse the isolation of the @entity4 economy			1
he started by asking how the situation has changed over the last six to 12 months			0
@entity38 ( @entity44 ) : what 's changed in the last year is the closure of the tunnels by the @entity33 government this was handling up to 200 tons of trade every day			1
fuel was running through , cars ( too )			0
it was a thriving ( entryway ) for bringing things in and of course @entity12 was collecting a lot of revenue from customs and licenses on these tunnels			2
@entity37 ( @entity61 ) : what are the conditions on the ground for @entity65 today with the tunnels shut and before the strikes ? @entity44 : about half of the @entity4 population receive humanitarian support from the @entity71			2
there 's also salaries coming in from the @entity74 to its members of the civil service -- there 's about 70,000 of those			0
but without that trade coming in through the @entity83 crossing from @entity33 , the situation is becoming increasingly more subdued and desperate for the people on the ground			0
@entity61 : grinding poverty and the desire by @entity12 to strike at @entity11			2
would you say there is a direct link ? @entity44 : well , i think the timing of this escalation is linked to a number of things			0
obviously we have the breakdown of the peace process			0
we have the reconciliation if you like , the unity government between @entity12 and @entity102			0
but certainly from the @entity12 point of view , the desperation they were in may have driven them to risk getting involved in this escalation on the assumption that a major crisis would result in a major reappraisal of the entire economic situation .			1

blockade has brought @entity4 economy to its knees
tunnels have been used to smuggle up to 200 tons of goods a day into @entity4 in recent years
escalation of conflict in recent weeks could be sign of @entity12 desperation , says @entity39 strategist @entity38
