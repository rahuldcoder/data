-- here is the question : can it be called a @entity5 film if there are no explosions ? with " @entity14 , " the director best known for action - packed films such as the " @entity11 " franchise and " @entity12 " goes decidedly smaller , though no less hefty in the over-the - top nature			1
the film -- which opens friday -- stars @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 as a trio of hapless bodybuilders who launch a harebrained kidnapping scheme			0
an action - comedy , it 's based on the true story of a murderous gang in @entity26 in the 1990s , which included a group of bodybuilders			2
unlike @entity5 's other projects that have found him alternately hailed and crucified ( he appears on both an @entity30 list of all - time worst and best movie directors ) , there is a dearth of stylized car chases , massive guns and things blowing up			1
" @entity14 " was not conceived as a massively budgeted , summer blockbuster			1
" i wanted to do a quirky movie , " @entity5 told @entity38			1
" i wanted to do something small , just actors acting			0
it was almost like film school again for me			0
" film school ? for the man who brought the world " @entity47 " and " @entity48 " ? perhaps that is why @entity50 at the @entity52 site penned " the case for @entity5 as @entity54			1
" " a @entity5 picture is many , many things , " @entity50 writes			1
" the global showman has made his career off shiny money shots , a broad sense of humor , solid on - screen pairings , well - orchestrated chaos , and much more			0
" despite the fact the new film is n't like most of his other movies , @entity50 sees elements of @entity68 in in it			0
" the director 's newest movie , the abrasively entertaining ' @entity14 , ' carries on those trademark signatures in many ways , " he says			1
" it 's not the explosions which make him an auteur , it 's the little things that make his human stories more meaningful than what we see from most blockbuster directors			2
he told @entity0 his latest project reminds him of another of his summer films from many years ago			0
" i do like releasing films in summer , but this is a small little movie , but it 's got a little of that ' @entity47 ' vibe to it , " @entity5 said			1
" so this kind of goes back to my roots			0
i like low - budget movies , and this is a character piece			2
" @entity97 contributor @entity95 notes that " it 's no secret that films like ' @entity101 ' ( an epic romantic drama set during the @entity104 attack on @entity101 ) and ' @entity105 ' ( a science - fiction thriller that serves as a parable for the perils of genetic science and / or abortion ) were @entity5 's attempts at artistic legitimacy			2
" they did n't quite work out , leading @entity5 to somewhat surrender and helm a big budget trilogy based on a toy line about cars / planes that turn into robots and fight each other , " @entity95 writes			1
" so here in ' @entity14 ' we see the return of ' serious ' @entity5			1
" @entity16 told the @entity38 he had full faith in @entity68 -- who has also cast the star in his next " @entity11 " film			0
" you get the artsy - fartsy guys of the world who do these little quirky comedies or dramas , that think they 're cool and they 're the artists , " the actor told the paper			0
" but he can do the stuff that other guys ca n't do			0
" co-star @entity136 , who is best known for " @entity138 " films , told @entity139 that " @entity14 " is " one of best @entity5 's films ever			1
" for his part , @entity5 seemed to have enjoyed the respite that came with being scaled down			2
he told @entity0 he tried to keep things intimate on the set			0
" it 's really refreshing just to have actors act , you know ? on ' transformers ' you are dealing with 2,000 people			0
this is much smaller , intimate , like a 100 - person crew ! "			2

" @entity14 " is not your usual @entity5 fare
the director is known for big , *flashy* *productions* with plenty of explosions
his new dark comedy had a smaller budget and crew
