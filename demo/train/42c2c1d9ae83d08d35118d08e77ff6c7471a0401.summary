@entity0 -- four months before the @entity4 crackdown in 1989 , a woman fired a gun in @entity7 's @entity6 -- all in the name of art. @entity10 fired two shots at her installation on the opening day of the " @entity7 / @entity14 " in @entity15			1
the show was temporarily closed			0
the artist and her boyfriend were apprehended but later released			2
among the stunned onlookers was @entity15 - based gallerist and @entity22 founder @entity22			0
" the army and the armed police came in and we had to leave , but we did n't really understand what was going on , " she recalls			0
twenty - four years on , the authorities ' reservations over performance art has not recovered			1
@entity30 , a leading curator at @entity7 's @entity31 , says there is an unwritten rule against performance art in state - owned exhibitions			1
" performance art has become very sensitive , " says @entity30			1
" ( but ) we need to have a general tolerance to this kind of expression			0
we need to build an open cultural policy			0
" @entity30 is tasked with building that policy as the curator of the @entity43 at this year 's @entity44			1
" this year , the @entity45 wants to show a good @entity7 image			1
they are in charge of the @entity49			2
" the theme of @entity30 's proposal is " transfiguration , " emphasizing a change in @entity7 contemporary art in both practice and definition			1
his curated selection includes works of painting , video , mixed media and an installation by a non-artist -- a house , once torn down in @entity15 , pieced back together and made anew for the @entity44			2
@entity30 says the @entity7 @entity45 gave him enough space to curate the @entity43 , but with conditions : " they gave me enough freedom , but they did give me some suggestions			1
for example , ' if this painting is too religious , let 's not put it in			0
' " to be an officially recognized contemporary artist in @entity7 , you must stay on script and veer away from the politically taboo			1
sensitive topics like the @entity4 crackdown and the @entity81 can not be touched as subject matter			2
erotic subjects must not be depicted explicitly			0
" and you can not paint any leader directly ( as ) a deformed figure , " adds @entity30			0
" besides that , anything you can try			0
" given such strict guidelines in a land known for censorship and government control , is there room for authenticity in @entity7 contemporary art ? for @entity7 activist / artist @entity98 , the answer is surely no. in a recent op - ed for @entity103 newspaper the @entity104 , @entity98 says outright that " @entity7 's art world does not exist			1
" " in a society that restricts individual freedoms and violates human rights , anything that calls itself creative or independent is a pretence , " he writes			0
despite a travel ban imposed on him by @entity15 , @entity98 's work will be at the @entity44 -- but representing @entity112			2
but to gallerists like @entity22 or @entity115 's international chairman of asian arts @entity116 there is indeed a vibrant contemporary art scene in @entity7 -- not just despite the restrictions -- but because of them			1
" it 's the sand in the oyster which creates the pearl , " says @entity116			0
" and i think that 's something which is rather exciting			0
" @entity22 adds : " there 's a certain level of struggle in contemporary art generally that makes things more exciting			0
a lot of @entity7 artists would say if you 're an average middle class @entity134 artist , life is too comfortable and things come easy to them : ' that 's not real contemporary art. ' " the @entity44 opens on june 1			1
visitors to the @entity43 can decide for themselves if @entity30 's " transfigurative " show can manage to be both on script and on the cutting edge .			2

@entity7 authorities are wary of performance art , *partly* *due* to an *incident* in 1989
an artist fired two shots at her installation ; she and her boyfriend were *briefly* detained
@entity30 is curating the @entity49 at this year 's @entity44
taboo subjects must be *avoided* he says , like @entity4 and overly explicit scenes
