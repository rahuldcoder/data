-- watching @entity2 being put through his paces at @entity5 's training facility in @entity6 , @entity7 , you could be forgiven for thinking he was a lot younger than his 40 years			1
but the veteran @entity10 goalkeeper , who is coming to the end of his first season with the @entity14 club , has no plans to hang up his gloves just yet			1
" i enjoy playing football so much that i try to keep disciplined			2
i do yoga -- i 've done that for eight or nine years now , " he told @entity19			0
@entity2 's fitness levels have allowed him to notch up over 450 appearances in @entity24 's top division in a career spanning 15 years and four clubs : @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity5			1
he has not missed an @entity14 game in almost eight seasons			0
footballers ' health has rarely been out the headlines in recent weeks after @entity36 ' @entity35 collapsed at @entity37 in the @entity39 quarterfinal against @entity5 last month			1
although he was n't on the pitch that day , the incident left @entity2 in shock and disbelief			1
" here you have a 23 - year - old , an incredibly fit footballer that collapses and goes into cardiac arrest and then 72 hours later you start to hear about the miracle , and it gave everyone a lift			1
" inevitably , the incident brought the issue of heart - screening of footballers to the fore , but @entity2 is confident that procedures in place are already pretty good			1
" i think it 's going to be better at some clubs than others			2
when i came here i was fully screened , also at @entity29 and @entity28			0
i think we have to take into consideration as well that these things just happen sometimes , " @entity2 said			1
" take what happened to my good friend @entity65 ( @entity29 player who was recently diagnosed with acute leukemia ) -- that was n't something that was openly going to be detected years prior			0
hopefully they 've caught it really early			0
" the most heartening aspect of both stories has been the positive response , he said			0
" the great thing about football is that it can bring everyone together and help do a lot of good around the world			2
" it 's nearly two decades since @entity81 - born @entity2 left his homeland in search of a professional career abroad			1
" soccer in the @entity10 has come a million miles from when i started			2
there was n't a professional league back then , " he said			0
" we all got scholarships into university if you were good enough and then if you were one of the lucky ones you would get into the youth national team			0
then , if you were really fortunate , you got a chance to play overseas			0
" @entity2 will return to the @entity10 in mid-year as @entity5 embark upon a preseason tour , with friendlies lined up against @entity97 and the @entity98			1
" i think the style of soccer we 've played over the years and especially since @entity102 ( @entity103 ) took over , has gone down well in the @entity10 , " he says			2
" we 're one of the teams people really enjoy watching and hopefully with the branding efforts we 'll become bigger in the @entity10			1
" but for now , @entity2 and @entity5 have more pressing matters to attend to with @entity109 qualification to secure			1
the club are currently lying fourth in the table , the final qualifying spot in the @entity14 , having dropped from third place after a poor run of results			0
" it 's very important that we 're in the @entity109 next year ... to attract the best players from around the world			2
it will be a disappointment if we do n't			0
i think the gaffer would say the same			0
