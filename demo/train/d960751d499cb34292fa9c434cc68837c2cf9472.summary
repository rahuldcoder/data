-- recently , one of the hottest trending articles on @entity3 was a picture collection of " the 18 worst things for left - handed people			1
" i clicked on this story with the index finger of my dominant right hand			2
i would do it again			2
the collection was cleverly put together by @entity3 editor @entity14 and featured simple things that , at least to us righties , are n't normally such a big deal			1
clearly , this is because we are the chosen ones			2
fortunately , i was chosen to do very little , and it works rather well with my current lifestyle			2
so long as we agree that power - binging on " @entity24 " counts as a lifestyle			1
actually , to be completely fair , there 's probably better evidence suggesting that , disproportionately , lefties are far more destined for greatness			1
perhaps they are the true chosen ones			2
consider , for example , that not only is @entity32 a lefty , but so too are three of our past four presidents			2
plus they also get to claim @entity36			2
and really , that 's the one that counts			2
in a fantasy lefty draft , @entity36 goes first			0
granted , that 's also about as far as the draft continues before somebody asks , " wait , why are we doing this ? " all that said , our world is custom - fit for righties , and nobody would willingly choose to be left - handed			1
there 's no tangible advantage			0
unless , i suppose , you strategically parlay having a naturally weaker handshake into low performance expectations at the office			0
which , mind you , is n't a horrible idea			0
my motto : promise mediocrity			0
" @entity63 job , @entity64			0
" sports are arguably the only place where being a lefty might have benefits			1
@entity70 needs left - handed pitchers			1
soccer needs left - footed wingers and backs			1
and apparently there 's a great advantage to being left - handed in fencing			1
but none of these translate into the real world , and one of the sports is , well , fencing			1
understandably , then , lefties have a bit of a complex			1
enough so that they 've even created their own holiday on august 13			0
they celebrate by spending the whole afternoon not being able to cut things with scissors			1
righties , on the other hand ( ugh -- i ca n't believe i just wrote that ) , do n't have a holiday , and that seems a little unfair			0
thus , i hereby declare july 27 as @entity97			1
our official @entity99 hashtag : # @entity101 ( for absolutely no good reason whatsoever , i just crowned him @entity103 of the @entity95			0
so , let 's see if we can get it to trend			0
he 'll be really confused			0
) but back to the trending @entity3 collection of worst things for lefties			1
the list actually begins with spiral notebooks and three - ring binders			1
these seem to be the bane of lefty student existence			0
in college i was keenly aware of this horrible injustice , and as an act of solidarity i refused to take notes			0
one more quick , noteworthy inclusion on @entity3 's list that 's worth mentioning here is the standard can opener			1
this is sort of the poster child for left - handed culinary inequality , and i desperately wanted to know what it felt like to fail at peas			1
to experience the anguish , i stopped writing , went over to the kitchen , grabbed a can opener , turned the handle away from me and pried off a lid just like a lefty			0
conclusion : it was n't that hard			0
we really need to stop giving this device so much respect			0
nevertheless , let 's support the lefties in our lives			2
according to most expert estimates , roughly 10 % of the population is left - handed			1
and you probably know one			0
so , as we 're here celebrating the very first @entity97 , take a moment to look a lefty in the eyes and offer a few words of encouragement			1
" @entity157 , i just want you to know that despite the fact that you ca n't use a dry erase board , i respect you			0
but not as much as @entity160			0
" you 're welcome .			0

" @entity164 " is a *skewed* look at trending social - media topics
@entity166 contemplates a @entity3 article on the 18 worst things for left - handers
a minority in a right - handed world , lefties seem only to have advantages in sports , he says
he supports left - handed pride but declares july 27 @entity97 handed @entity179
