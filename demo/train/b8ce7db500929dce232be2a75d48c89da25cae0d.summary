-- nine weeks after @entity2 underwent a double mastectomy to prevent cancer , the actress had another surgery to reconstruct her breasts using implants			1
" there have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years , and the results can be beautiful , " @entity2 wrote in her op - ed piece for the @entity9			1
breast reconstruction is not right for everyone , says @entity0 contributor dr. @entity16 , a plastic surgeon in @entity19			2
but studies have shown that women who undergo immediate reconstruction following a mastectomy benefit psychologically			2
" to most women , their breasts are really a part of how they see themselves , " @entity16 says			2
" when you take it away ... it 's like you 're losing a part of yourself and a part of what you identify with as being a woman			2
" infographic : breast reconstruction options the majority of patients who want to proceed with reconstruction have options available , says dr. @entity40 , a surgeon at @entity41 in @entity42			1
there are two main types to choose from : implants or reconstruction using the patient 's own tissue			1
some patients have a history of radiation treatments for breast cancer , which may prevent them from receiving implants ( radiation can cause scarring , which makes the skin less flexible ) ; others do n't have enough donor tissue available on their body to use in a reconstruction			1
otherwise the decision is left up to the patient 's preference , @entity40 says			1
five reasons we love @entity2 if the patient chooses to have breast implants , there are usually two procedures involved			1
the first is done to place a tissue expander under the muscle in the breast cavity			2
over the next few months , the expander is injected with saline regularly to stretch the muscle			0
" if you just put an implant into the breast , it 's basically going to sag because there 's nothing to hold it up , " @entity16 explains			2
this option allows the patient to decide what size implants she 's most comfortable with , @entity40 says			1
" women who choose implant reconstruction will often choose to go slightly smaller or larger ( than their original breast size ) , depending on how much the skin stretches , " she says			0
tough choices in fight against breast cancer gene the second implant surgery involves placing the permanent implant -- either filled with silicone gel or saline -- in the enlarged cavity			0
this procedure generally takes between 1.5 and 3 hours , @entity16 says			0
" it 's typically easier , less painful and less invasive " than the second option utilizing the patient 's own tissue , he says			1
breast implants are not lifelong devices , according to the @entity103			1
a tear in the silicone shell can cause a leak			0
@entity108 implants will visibly show the leak by sagging ; the @entity103 recommends silicone gel implant patients get a follow - up mri every couple of years			0
the second option is a more complex surgery and has a longer recovery period			0
patients generally choose it because it 's done in a single procedure and they want a more natural result , @entity40 says			1
breasts reconstructed with the patient 's tissue are softer and will age like a normal breast			1
what is the brca gene ? in this procedure , tissue is taken from the patient -- most often from their abdominal area -- and moved to the breast			1
this can be done with muscle or without , and there are several ways to keep blood flowing to the tissue , @entity40 says			1
these decisions depend on how much tissue and / or blood flow is available for the surgeon to work with			0
" other options include ( taking ) tissue from the back , thigh and buttocks , " she says			0
the @entity148 of 1998 ensures all reconstruction services are covered by insurance			0
that includes any surgery that needs to be done on the opposite breast to make them symmetrical and any nipple reconstruction procedures			2
almost 80 % of patients have nipple reconstruction done following a breast reconstruction surgery , according to the @entity159			0
@entity16 takes skin from the breast to recreate the nipple			0
he then sends his patients to a tattoo artist who will fill in the darker color to create the areola			0
with both types of breast reconstruction the patient will retain some sensation			2
but numbness is to be expected afterward , @entity16 says			0
why more women are choosing double mastectomies			0

@entity2 opted to have breast implants following her double mastectomy
another option is to have breasts reconstructed from the patient 's own tissue
both procedures have their positives and *negatives* , dr. @entity40 says
