meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord			0
it is usually caused by an infection , frequently with bacteria or a virus , but it can also be caused by less common pathogens like fungi , according to the @entity2			2
fungal meningitis is very rare and , unlike viral and bacterial meningitis , it is not contagious			1
symptoms of fungal meningitis are similar to symptoms from other forms of meningitis , but they often appear more gradually and can be very mild at first , the @entity2 says			1
dr. @entity136 , chairman of the @entity137 at @entity138 , told @entity1 that fungal infections are not usually mild			2
he said when a fungus invades small blood vessels , it can cause them to clot or bleed , which can lead to symptoms of small strokes			0
in addition to typical meningitis symptoms like headache , fever , nausea and stiffness of the neck , people with fungal meningitis may also experience confusion , dizziness and discomfort from bright lights			1
patients might just have one or two of these symptoms , the @entity2 says			2
health officials say any patients who received an injection at one of the facilities beginning july 1 and who began showing symptoms between one and three weeks after being injected should see their doctor right away			2
the earlier a patient gets treatment , the more likely he or she will survive			0
patients are treated with anti-fungal medication , which is given intravenously , so patients have to be admitted to the hospital , the @entity2 said			2
patients may need to be treated for months			0
the @entity39 is urging anyone who has experienced problems following an injection with the @entity28 product to report it to @entity183 , the @entity39 's voluntary reporting program , by phone at 1 - 800 - @entity39 - 1088 or online at @entity186			0
