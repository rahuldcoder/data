the @entity0 passed a spending bill to fund the government through next september — so why have n't they gone home yet ? here 's a look at what lawmakers could get done before they can hit the road and head home for the holidays			1
so what 's left on the agenda for @entity12 ? the @entity0 has to confirm about two dozen nominations , including some higher profile candidates for key administration spots			2
there are also two major policy items that remain unfinished — a reauthorization of the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , a law that helps insurance companies cover @entity22 in case of terrorist attacks , and the extension of a package of tax breaks that expired in 2013			1
the @entity29 - passed version of @entity19 remains somewhat controversial among @entity30 and @entity31 sen. @entity31 , so its future is unclear			2
and though senate majority leader @entity34 has indicated he 'd like to extend those breaks , he has n't yet given a timeline for action			0
did n't @entity30 already approve most of those nominees this weekend ? they did clear procedural hurdles on most of those nominees during their rare saturday session — an unintended consequence of @entity45 sen. @entity44 's insistence that the @entity0 stick around and vote on the constitutionality of @entity48 's executive action on deportations			2
the conservative troublemaker was hoping to emphasize @entity52 frustration with @entity48 , but instead drew the ire of his colleagues by making them stick around on a saturday , and by opening the door for @entity30 to get a lot of the work of confirming those nominees out of the way			2
related : @entity0 sends spending bill to @entity48 , avoiding government shutdown will they get all two dozen nominees confirmed ? many face minimal opposition , but there is a chance that the mere volume of work could leave some of the candidates unconfirmed , if fatigued lawmakers choose to get out of town and home to their families rather than tackle the less important nominees			1
but @entity76 , @entity48 's nominee for deputy secretary of state , has drawn @entity52 opposition for comments he made lauding @entity81 's stability			0
republicans might also make some noise over @entity84 , who was nominated to head @entity85 and @entity86 , as a way to show their distaste for @entity48 's executive action on deportations			0
but those other two items seem pretty straight forward — why are they still up in the air ? the controversies surrounding @entity19 and the tax extenders bill are in the details			1
a number of @entity30 oppose @entity19 because it includes a provision that rolls back a part of the @entity100 financial reform bill , much the same reason @entity30 in both the @entity29 and the @entity0 opposed the government funding bill this weekend			1
and @entity31 , a @entity52 from @entity103 known for his outspoken commitment to fiscal responsibility , objects to a provision that creates a new federal bureau dealing with insurance companies without allowing states to opt out of it			0
@entity31 is so staunchly opposed , he 's said he does n't mind if it expires and the new @entity52 - led @entity0 has to take it up in january			0
the tax extenders bill is simply an extension of more than 50 tax breaks that expired at the end of last year , and while some lawmakers say the short - term extension creates uncertainty for businesses down the line , it 's largely uncontroversial			1
that seems the more likely of the two to happen this week			0
but votes do n't typically take that long , and the @entity0 's first votes on monday are n't scheduled until 5:30 p.m. how are they going to fill all that downtime ? by saying goodbye			0
with 11 senators retiring or leaving after losing this cycle , all are taking their final moments on the @entity0 floor to thank their colleagues and reminisce on their time in office			1
most have said their farewells already , but there may be more tributes to come this week .			0

the @entity0 still has around two dozen nominees and two policy items to consider
still unfinished : a reauthorization of the @entity19 and the extension of a number of tax breaks
