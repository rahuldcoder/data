with parts of his capital ablaze , @entity4 said he was asking his government to resign and would soon announce a new one , pledging to address the concerns of thousand of @entity3 protesting in @entity16 's streets			1
" i just spoke to him after his speech , " @entity1 said , " and told him he has a responsibility to give meaning to those words , to take concrete steps and actions that deliver on that promise			0
violence will not address the grievances of the @entity3 people			1
suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away			0
" this moment of volatility has to be turned into a moment of promise , " @entity1 said			0
the @entity35 president repeated his administration 's call for the @entity3 government to restore access to the internet and cell phone service and urged " concrete steps that advance the rights of the @entity3 people			1
" @entity1 's remarks , delivered from @entity45 , were the strongest yet from the @entity35			1
" there must be reform , " he said , " political , social and economic reforms that meet the aspirations of the @entity3 people			2
" in the absence of these reforms , " he said , " grievances have built up over time			0
" the @entity35 will continue to stand up for the rights of the @entity3 people and work with their government in pursuit of a future that is more just , more free and more hopeful , " he concluded			1
in his remarks , @entity4 was clear that he had no intentions of stepping down -- yet his resignation is what the protesters are demanding			0
and privately , @entity35 officials fear that @entity4 may be in over his head as protests against his 30 - year rule showed no signs of ending			1
a senior administration official said the @entity67 saw @entity4 's address as " hardly conciliatory and highly disappointing , but what did you expect ? " it 's clear , the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that @entity4 believes he can ride this out , " and this time , we 're not so sure that is the right assumption			1
" administration officials had hoped @entity4 would promise an immediate and open dialogue , the official said			2
before the speech , senior @entity35 officials had similar thoughts , worrying that the @entity3 government may not realize all it is up against or what the protesters are saying			1
@entity4 , they said , has two choices : to embrace meaningful reforms or to continue the crackdown			0
the @entity35 is being very careful not to be too tough on the @entity3 leader directly , the senior officials said , because they fear that might drive the government into a survivalist mentality , causing a further crackdown			1
the officials said conversations with the @entity3 government are taking place across the @entity35 administration , including with @entity35 ambassador to @entity3 @entity101 , who has participated in several videoconferences with @entity103 during the day			1
a senior @entity105 official said , " our initial impression is that he emphasized security far more than reform			0
" " we 'll see what the implications for the government reshuffle are , but he was not particularly forthcoming in the speech , " said the official , who could n't speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation			0
earlier , @entity67 spokesman @entity118 said the administration is " very concerned " about the situation in @entity3 , adding that at risk could be economic and military aid from the @entity35			1
" this is a situation that will be solved by the people of @entity3 , " @entity118 said			1
" we are watching very closely the actions of the government , the police and all of those in the military			0
" the @entity35 will review its " assistance posture " to @entity3 based on events that take place in the coming days , he said			1
@entity118 declined to elaborate how the @entity35 might alter relations with a key ally in the region but urged restraint as massive demonstrations have resulted in widespread property damage , including at the offices of @entity3 's ruling party			1
that building was burned and ransacked by protesters in @entity16 on friday , @entity142 reported			0
a @entity0 witness saw the building ablaze			0

" the die is cast , " said @entity157 , the president emeritus of the @entity158			0
" the administration has made clear that it leans toward the demonstrators			0
" @entity118 said , " we 've reach a point where the grievances of the people have to be addressed through concrete reforms " but would not elaborate on the potential fallout if the @entity4 government -- considered a strategic ally in the region -- does not survive the protests			1
" we do n't know who these people are or if they are at all capable of putting a government together , " @entity157 said , cautioning of a power vacuum left by the possible collapse of the three - decade - old government			0

former @entity193 defense secretary @entity270 said @entity1 is likely reluctant to call @entity4 " without it appearing that we are directing what @entity4 should do and he is responding to the control of the @entity35			1
" " i think that , if anything , one might ask why has n't president @entity4 called president @entity1 and said , ' are you with me or against me ? ' i mean , that would be a call that might also be worthy of consideration , " @entity270 said			2
