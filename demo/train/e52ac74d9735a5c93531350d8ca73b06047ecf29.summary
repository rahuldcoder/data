@entity0 , @entity1 -- officials working to free 33 trapped miners in a collapsed @entity1 mine said tuesday they had cleared a drilling hole that was blocked by a shattered drill bit			1
engineer @entity8 said all the pieces of the broken drill bit that were in the hole drilled by the @entity13 operation had been removed , and drilling could begin again soon			1
the @entity13 drill is widening a narrow hole drilled when rescuers first searched for the miners after the mine collapsed august 5			1
that drill was making the fastest progress of the other rescue operations -- plan a and @entity23 -- when it hit an obstruction , possibly a reinforcement beam , at a depth of 268 meters ( 879 feet )			1
" this bit was upside down and we used a spider ... to pull it out , " @entity8 said , holding up the " nose " of the bit that he said weighed about 12 kilograms ( about 26 pounds )			2
" @entity34 " are specially designed claws that were made to pull out the broken drill pieces			1
a second customized bit was expected to arrive later tuesday , and @entity8 said a camera was being lowered into the hole to check it out before drilling restarts			1
but a rescue crew member who is not authorized to speak to the media said workers are not certain all the pieces of the drill bit have been pulled out			1
" we 're not out of the woods yet , there may be some steel down there , " the crew member said			1
meanwhile , the @entity51 drill -- the only drill currently operating at the mine -- reached a depth of 283 meters ( 928 feet ) tuesday , @entity8 said			1
the @entity55 oil platform drill was under construction and about 70 percent finished			2
drilling in that operation , which is expected to go faster than the other two , will likely begin september 20 , @entity8 said			2
the miners are trapped in a safety chamber , 2,300 feet underground			0
officials have acknowledged that it could be november before they 're freed			0
@entity63 , whose @entity65 - based company @entity64 is rushing the replacement bit for @entity13 to the site , described what happened when the drill hit the beam			2
" all of a sudden , the penetration rate stopped , the drill string torqued up violently , and we tried to pull off bottom , " he said monday			0
" we were hung in the hole -- we worked at that for a while , and the bit passed out of that obstruction and then out of the hole			0
" at that point in time , we really did n't know what the problem was until we cleared the rotary table and brought it back to surface			0
" a power line dropped down to the men sunday will allow them to install electrical lights in their safety chamber , officials said			0
they also were granted a long - standing request for cigarettes			0
officials are sending down two packs a day to be split among the miners who smoke , @entity1 mining minister @entity93 said			2
cigarettes were among the first requests made by some of the miners , but they were instead supplied with nicotine patches and gum			0
upgrades made to ventilation in the mine led officials to decide to allow them to smoke , @entity93 said			0
@entity2 's @entity106 in @entity0 contributed to this report .			0
