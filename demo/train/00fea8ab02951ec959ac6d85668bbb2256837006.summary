-- lawyers for a man who ran a notorious torture prison in @entity4 where more than 14,000 people died during the 1970s @entity7 regime are appealing his conviction			0
the lawyers for @entity10 , @entity11 , say he should be acquitted since he was " a witness of the events of the relevant period " and should be in witness protection -- not detention			1
@entity11 was convicted of war crimes , crimes against humanity , murder and torture in july in a @entity20 - backed war crimes tribunal also known as the @entity22 in the @entity23			1
@entity11 's lawyers also say the court did not have jurisdiction , the appeal states			1
" to interpret the applicable law in reliance on international customary law is inconsistent " with the law of the @entity22 , according to the appeal			0
earlier this month , prosecutors in @entity4 appealed @entity11 's 30 - year sentence , saying the punishment was too light			1
" the co-prosecutors are of the view that the judgment gives insufficient weight to the gravity of @entity11 's crimes and his role and his willing participation in those crimes , " they said in a statement			1
" at the same time , the co-prosecutors believe that undue weight is placed on any mitigating circumstances applicable to @entity11			2
" some survivors had been angered by the sentence for @entity11			1
his prison term would have been about 19 years after the court took off 11 years for the time he has already served behind bars			0
the verdict sparked strong reactions as word spread outside the courtroom			0
some said it made them lose faith in the @entity20 - backed war crimes tribunal			1
" it 's becoming a sham , " @entity62 , chairwoman of the @entity63 , said after the verdict			0
at least 1.7 million people -- nearly a quarter of @entity4 's population -- died under the 1975 - 1979 @entity7 regime from execution , disease , starvation and overwork , according to the @entity73			0
@entity11 , 67 , was the head of the @entity75			2
few people brought to the prison made it out alive ; only about a dozen were found by the @entity80 , who invaded @entity4 in 1979			0
prosecutors had initially sought a 40 - year sentence			1
the judges first gave @entity11 35 years , but took five years off that for the time he was illegally detained before the tribunal was established			2
prosecutors have said the judgment failed " to reflect the full extent of @entity11 's criminal conduct " and he should be " separately convicted of the crimes against humanity of enslavement , imprisonment , torture , rape , extermination , and other inhumane acts			1
these crimes should not have been subsumed into the crimes of persecution and torture			2
" the judge , in announcing @entity11 's sentence , said he took into consideration that the defendant had expressed remorse , admitted responsibility and cooperated with the court			1
the judge also took into account the " coercive environment " of the @entity7 , he said @entity11 pleaded guilty , but he said he was only following orders and asked for forgiveness			2
last november , he asked to be freed after spending some 11 years in detention			0
in the last week of his trial , @entity11 argued that international law did not apply to him because he was following orders			2
the tribunal began its work in 2007 after a decade of on - and - off negotiations between the @entity20 and @entity4 over the structure and functioning of the court			0
@entity11 's verdict was the court 's first			0
another four of the ultra-maoist regime 's former leaders are waiting to see if they will stand trial before the @entity20 - backed tribunal for war crimes and crimes against humanity			1
co-prosecutors filed a final submission in these cases and asked that the four be indicted and sent for trial , according to a statement from the prosecutors ' office			0
it 's not known when the court will make a decision .			0

attorneys : @entity11 was " a witness of the events " and should be in witness protection
@entity11 is convicted of war crimes , crimes against humanity , murder and torture
prosecutors : 30 - year sentence is too light
