as demonstrators walked the near mile from @entity121 to @entity106 -- and then back -- police were peppered on the periphery , and there were many moments when none was in sight			2
@entity128 , assistant commanding officer of the @entity129 , said the force established a working relationship with the protesters , and " they approached us in the very beginning , " he said			2

" protester @entity175 claims the monthlong protests are " rooted in targeting those financial institutions that tanked our economy in 2008 , made a profit out of it , and have not been held accountable by anybody			2
" @entity175 argued that " corporate power has come to dominate politics " and blamed institutions such as the investment firm @entity186 for " selling these packages of derivatives , that they knew were junk , to everybody , and at the same time betting against them			2
" @entity186 and other firms underwent intense scrutiny in april this year after a @entity196 report found that it had misled clients and later @entity198 about short - selling securities linked to the housing market just prior to the 2008 financial crisis			2
the investment house has said the report exaggerated the bets , and -- along with other firms -- has been subject to high job losses in the wake of the crisis			2

' " @entity228 turned out amid debt troubles and austerity plans in @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity239 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity243 , that analysts say have contributed to volatility in @entity9 markets			0
