-- @entity1 had no idea what he would say to a family dealing with unthinkable grief			1
he just knew he had to be there			0
that , on this emotional day , was enough			0
the star @entity10 receiver drove to @entity11 , @entity12 , this week to meet with the family of @entity14 , one of the 20 children killed in the @entity14			1
the 6 - year - old boy had been buried a day earlier , wearing the no. 80 jersey of his favorite football player			1
@entity1 did n't have any speech prepared			1
he came to deliver a pair of cleats he had worn two days earlier when the @entity10 lost to the @entity24 -- he had scrawled the words " @entity14 , @entity26 " on one and " @entity28 " on the other -- but mostly he was there to offer support			1
he listened to the family talk about @entity33 , sitting in the same chair where the boy 's father watched the @entity10 beat the @entity37 in the @entity38 10 months earlier			1
he played the @entity40 video game with the kids , quickly discovering that being there was more important than anything he could say			0
" i was a little nervous , " @entity1 said			1
" i just did n't know how i was going to be received			0
you never know , when they 're going through something like that , how it 's going to go down			2
once i got there and i saw all the kids there with my jersey on , the family ... the family was outside , and they were still pretty emotional , crying			2
i saw how affected they were by just my presence alone			0
" we hear a lot about the " power of sports , " and usually , that phrase is little more than a @entity63 ©			2
but as 2012 comes to a close , there were plenty of examples of athletes using their popularity and influence to make a difference in their communities and beyond			1
strangers inspired to honor @entity11 victims there were the @entity78 players , past and present , who rallied around a team employee named @entity80			1
the media relations director and young mother was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer , so the team organized a massive charity dinner and auction			0
up for bids : pitching lessons with former @entity90 winners @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 ; hitting lessons from @entity78 third baseman @entity95 ; and signed bats from @entity99 stars @entity97 and @entity100			2
there was the story of the @entity104 , canceled in the aftermath of @entity106			0
with nowhere to run , thousands of athletes instead spent the weekend in the hardest - hit areas , unloading supplies at shelters or helping to clean up wrecked homes			0
some had seen a lifelong dream washed away but instead accomplished something even more fulfilling			0
there were the @entity116 players and cheerleaders who shaved their heads to support cancer research			0
the team 's head coach , @entity120 , was forced to leave the team after he was diagnosed with leukemia			2
in the months that followed , the team raised more than $ 250,000 , and several local businesses also held successful fundraisers			0
and then there was the support after the @entity11 tragedy			1
@entity132 running back @entity131 wrote the names of all 20 young victims on his cleats and then scored on a 94 - yard touchdown run			0
@entity97 , the iconic @entity99 shortstop , called the family of teacher @entity138 , who hid her students in a bathroom and died trying to protect them from shooter @entity141			2
simple gestures like these ca n't make the pain go away			0
but @entity10 head coach @entity146 might have summed up their potential impact the best when he talked to @entity1 about his trip to @entity11 : " that family will remember that all their days			1
and hopefully , some of their grief might at least temporarily be spent in being able to embrace @entity1			1
" @entity1 first heard that one of the victims at @entity157 was a fan through his @entity159 feed			1
he spoke to the @entity28 family on saturday night from his hotel room in @entity162 , making a promise to the boy 's 11 - year - old brother , @entity164 , that he would stay in touch			1
so on tuesday , the @entity10 ' off day , he drove with his @entity168 © e and 11 - month - old daughter to keep that pledge			1
he played football in the front yard with some of the other kids in the neighborhood , " we got to smile a little bit , which was good for them , " @entity1 said			1
" it was a time where i just wanted to be a positive voice , a positive light in a time where it can be really negative			0
they 're a great family , and they 're really united right now , and it was good to see			2
" we reached out to them , and we exchanged information , so we 're going to try as much as we can to keep in contact			0
just little things , just to say hello a couple months from now , years , and just say ' how you doing ? ' and stuff like that , just to see how they 're doing from time to time			0
" sometimes , the little things can show that the " power of sports " is more than just a @entity63 ©			2
ways to donate in memory of the victims			0

@entity10 ' @entity1 was @entity11 victim @entity14 's favorite player
@entity1 visited the family in @entity11 this week
he says he plans to stay in touch with the @entity205
