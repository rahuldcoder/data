" she became an icon of the country 's reform movement and co-founded the @entity66 ( @entity66 )			1
@entity4 : the lynchpin of @entity68 but the uprising came to a shuddering halt in september 1988 , when the military restored control after a brutal crackdown and imposed martial law			1

despite continuous harassment from the military -- including a ban imposed on her standing for election -- she continued to campaign until she was placed under house arrest in july , 1989			1

her release came too late for the national elections that year , which saw the military - backed @entity176 led by president @entity177 -- prime minister under the junta -- declare victory despite accusations of voting irregularities and voter intimidation			2

with the spotlight on the electoral process after the problems of 2010 , @entity2 claimed that the april vote would not be " free and fair " but that she did not " at all regret having taken part " because the election campaign had raised political awareness among @entity4 's population			1
