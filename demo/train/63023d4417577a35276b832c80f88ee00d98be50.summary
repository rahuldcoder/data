-- after releasing two generations of @entity3 with exactly the same form factor , @entity1 is expected to show off a new chassis design -- and possibly new materials -- in its sixth - generation smartphone			2
and a little - known alloy that @entity1 has quietly been using for the past two years could be just the ticket to make consumers swoon			0
@entity11 reported wednesday that the @entity12 is likely to be housed in @entity13 , the commercial name for an alloy of titanium , zirconium , nickel , copper and other metals			1
it would make the outer surface of the phone " smooth like liquid , " according to the report			0
" the next @entity12 needs to truly stand out from the crowd , " @entity27 analyst @entity26 told @entity0 via email			1
" a change in materials is a likely way to differentiate its form factor			0
" @entity13 was discovered at the @entity34 in 1992			1
it 's a class of patented amorphous metal alloys ( basically metallic glass ) with unique properties including high strength , high wear resistance against scratching and denting , and a good strength - to - weight ratio			2
@entity1 was granted rights to use it in august of 2010			0
" @entity13 allows precision parts to be fabricated similar to plastic injection molding , but with similar properties to metal , " @entity46 senior principal analyst @entity45 said			1
in today 's metal - based gadgets , you either need to bend a piece of sheet metal , or die - cast with an inferior alloy like aluminum or magnesium			2
in die - casting , the alloys tend to be brittle and have poor wear resistance			0
@entity13 's injection molding process is still a relatively new technology , and it 's fairly expensive -- but that 's not necessarily anything that @entity1 would shy away from			1
@entity13 has been used in @entity1 products ( as well as those of other manufacturers ) for several years			1
the sim card ejector tool in some @entity68 first - generation ipads was made of @entity13 , and since then , @entity45 said , it 's been used in a number of other internal parts and small mechanical components			1
" we expect @entity1 and other manufacturers to start using this not only for larger and more visible portions of devices , but also entire enclosures , " @entity45 said			0
thus , a @entity12 chassis seems entirely reasonable to expect in the not - too - distant future			1
@entity26 also noted that the discovery and use of new materials was one of @entity85 ' obsessions			0
" but @entity1 will need to ensure a change in material does not compromise the performance of the device , " he added , noting the infamous " antenna-gate " issue with the @entity87			0
reports that an upcoming @entity12 could have a metal back and a unibody case have been circling since well before the @entity94 was announced			2
