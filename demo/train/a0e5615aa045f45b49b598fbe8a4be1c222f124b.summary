-- long before @entity4 became internationally known as a human rights crusader , villagers near his home knew him as the man to go to when they had trouble with local authorities			1
despite having little formal legal education , @entity4 began advocating on behalf of villagers in 1996 at the age of 25 , according to @entity11 , a @entity12 - based human rights group			1
@entity4 has been at the center of a burgeoning international impasse since his dramatic escape last week from the guards who kept him under house arrest in a small village in eastern @entity12			1
he was confined to his home after serving four years in prison , apparently over his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices such as forced abortions by @entity12 's family planning officials			0
fellow activists say he made his way to the @entity28 in @entity29 , where he remains as the @entity30 and @entity12 try to sort out the future for @entity4 , who has sought to call attention to the practice of forced abortions and sterilizations in @entity12			1
yet he never sought out to be a rabble - rouser , said @entity38 law professor @entity37 , who first met @entity4 when the activist traveled to the @entity30 as part of a @entity42 program in 2004			1
" you got the feeling you were in the presence of some @entity12 equivalent of @entity47 or something , " @entity37 said			0
" he had this gentle but steely moral force			0
" @entity4 was born in 1971 in @entity50 , a small farming village in eastern @entity52 province , more than 400 kilometers ( 248 miles ) from @entity29			1
after an eye infection left him blind as a child , @entity4 seemed destined to a farmer 's life , just like his parents			1
but at the age of 17 , @entity4 's fortune turned when he learned of a school for the blind in a nearby city			1
@entity4 learned the law from television and radio broadcasts , newspapers and books			1
he also took a few constitutional law classes at the college for the blind -- where the primary course of study was massage therapy			1
" when he came back to his village , he did n't want to spend his time giving massages , " @entity37 said			0
" he wanted to help people who were n't getting help elsewhere			0
" he quickly became known locally as an advocate for farmers and the disabled in @entity52 , where he offered free advice on taxes and corruption and stood up for the disabled			1
" someone has to fight for people with no voice , " @entity85 quoted him as saying			0
" i guess that person is me			0
" he also helped his village obtain a system to pump well water , making clean water easily accessible to villagers for the first time and helping cement his local reputation , @entity37 said			0
his desire to continue helping the disabled and voiceless led @entity4 and his wife , @entity100 , to take on concerns that officials in @entity103 , a city in @entity52 , were using violence and coercion in a campaign to enforce @entity12 's policy limiting many couples to one child			1
the investigation carried him to @entity29 , where he pressed national officials to take action against the local authorities			0
it also carried him to prison , where he spent four years behind bars on what supporters called trumped - up charges before authorities confined him to house arrest in 2010			2
what @entity4 was fighting : forced abortions in a video released after his escape last week , @entity4 said he and his family were beaten and cut off from the outside world during their detention			1
the case that brought him to international prominence began in 2005			1
that 's when he learned of claims that local officials were requiring parents with two children to be sterilized and forcing abortions in women pregnant with their third child , according to human rights groups			1
the officials were trying to meet birth quotas set by the national government , according to @entity144			0
in june 2005 , three months after beginning his investigation , @entity4 organized a lawsuit against local officials and traveled to @entity29 to meet with legal experts and tell international journalists about his findings			1
hours after meeting with journalists from @entity85 , he was taken into custody by government agents and sent back to his home , where he was placed under house arrest			0
authorities also refused to allow his lawsuit to proceed			0
@entity4 escaped from house arrest at that time as well and ventured to @entity29 , where he met with supporters -- including @entity37			1
@entity4 was pale , anxious , with little appetite , @entity37 said			2
but it was apparent even then that the people he was trying to help with his legal efforts was what concerned him , not his own welfare , @entity37 said			0
" one day , when he was especially frustrated by the county court 's refusal to accept the lawsuits he brought on behalf of impoverished pro bono ' clients , ' he asked me : ' what do the authorities want me to do ? lead a protest in the streets ? i do n't want to do that , ' " @entity37 said in testimony to the @entity174 in november			2
ironically , that 's what authorities soon accused @entity4 of doing			2
his august 2006 conviction on charges of " intentionally damaging property and gathering crowds to disturb transport order " led to a four - year prison sentence			2
human rights groups roundly called the charges trumped - up and demanded his release			2
instead , @entity4 went to prison where , according to @entity144 , fellow prisoners beat @entity4 on orders of guards , authorities refused him medical treatment and limited visits with his wife and lawyers to no more than 30 minutes a month			2
by this time , the detained activist had turned into an international cause celebre			0
@entity85 selected him as one of 2006 's " @entity201 , " along with premier @entity202			0
the following year , the @entity203 , which grants prizes to @entity205 who excel in their fields , named @entity4 among its honorees for his " irrepressible passion for justice in leading ordinary @entity12 citizens to assert their legitimate rights under the law			1
" after serving his sentence in september 2009 , @entity4 was released to house arrest , but he and his family continued to endure abuse , according to human rights groups and @entity4 himself			2
in a video released april 27 , @entity4 said guards repeatedly beat him and his wife and prevented visitors from reaching their home			2
" all the stories online about the brutal treatment i received from the @entity103 authorities , i can personally testify they are true , " he said in the video posted to @entity226			0
" the reality is even harsher than the stories that have been circulating			0
" in the video released after @entity4 's escape , he called on @entity12 authorities to leave his family alone and punish the officials who he says illegally detained him and engaged in abuses against him and his family			2
the man whose ever - present dark sunglasses have become a symbol for supporters worldwide also posed a question to @entity12 officials who have taken great steps to keep his name and likeness out of the national media and discussions			0
" if you continue to ignore me , " he said , " what would the public think ? " @entity0 's @entity29 bureau chief @entity251 contributed to this report .			0
