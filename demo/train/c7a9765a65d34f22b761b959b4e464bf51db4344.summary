@entity0 in the @entity1 is a combination of traditions from around the world			0
evergreen trees inside homes were popularized in @entity6 during the 16th century			0
decorating with poinsettias ? that idea came from @entity9 ( and the name of the plant came from @entity12 , the first @entity1 minister to mexico )			0
and 18th - century @entity13 helped to change mistletoe 's image from a poisonous plant to a poisonous plant that 's also a festive kissing trap			2
however , there 's one favorite tradition with an @entity21 origin : electric christmas tree lights			1
it started when @entity24 , a friend and business partner of @entity26 , put a string of 80 hand - wired red , white and blue electric lights on a christmas tree in 1882			1
since the majority of @entity1 did n't have access to electric power until the 1930s , it took about 50 years for @entity24 's creation to become popular			0
since then , it 's become an essential part of @entity1 @entity0 celebrations , whether that means a couple of strings of " tasteful " white lights around the family tree or a pulsating public display synchronized to " @entity46 " that can be seen from low orbit			2
with a nod to mr. @entity24 's first tree , here are eight of the best locations in the @entity1 where the electric light tradition continues to shine brightly			2
