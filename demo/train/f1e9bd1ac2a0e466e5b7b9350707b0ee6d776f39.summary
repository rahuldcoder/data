-- large volumes of gas continued friday to gush into the @entity3 from an offshore oil platform , with energy giant @entity5 trying two divergent methods in hopes of stopping the leak			1
@entity10 environment secretary @entity9 said friday that authorities are prepared for the worst , but he added that it is believed that the " gas condensate " now flowing into the water " will evaporate naturally into the atmosphere			1
" " as such , the current environmental risk continues to be minimal , " @entity9 said			1
the @entity18 platform sprang a leak sunday , prompting the evacuation of 238 people from the platform and the adjacent @entity24 drilling rig , according to total executive @entity25			1
the leak seems to have started as workers were sealing the well in the @entity3 , about 150 miles ( 240 kilometers ) east of the @entity10 city of @entity30			1
since then , energy company and government officials have weighed what to do about it , with one option being waiting for the gas to stop leaking on its own			2
on friday , one day after announcing it had pinpointed the source of the leak , @entity5 detailed its dueling approaches to stop it : blocking the outflow with " heavy mud " ( consisting of a mixture that contains mineral compounds ) and drilling a pair of relief wells			1
until then , " the leak remains ongoing , " according to @entity25			0
gas is now gushing into the @entity3 at an estimated rate of 2 kilograms per second , which translates to about 200,000 cubic meters per day			1
the @entity3 was the scene of the world 's worst offshore rig disaster , the @entity51 explosion , which killed 167 people in 1988			2
the @entity18 leak has echoes of the @entity56 oil spill in the @entity57 in 2010 -- including the fact that both emerged as workers were closing off wells -- but there are differences			2
the @entity18 is in shallower water than the @entity56 spill , which could make problems easier to fix			2
and instead of oil , it is leaking gas , which can disperse faster but ignites more easily			2
" this is nothing on the scale of the @entity57 spill two years ago , " oceanographer @entity70 said			0
" this is a relatively light spill			0
the gas itself is dispersing quite rapidly			0
" after @entity5 's share price fell sharply earlier in the week , it rebounded slightly on friday with a 0.9 % gain			1
guys , the executive from the energy giant , said friday that " all other " total wells in the vicinity are in " safe condition , " signaling that there is no expectation of further problems			0
@entity89 has also partially evacuated two of its nearby platforms , @entity90 and @entity92 , as a " purely precautionary " measure , it said wednesday			0
satellites and spotter planes are being used to assess the latest spill , while several vessels are on standby nearby ready to help , @entity25 said			0
@entity9 , @entity10 's environmental minister , said he was " pleased " that " more information " on the incident had been released by @entity5 and the @entity99 government			1
while expressing faith that the long - term impact on the environment should n't be major , @entity9 said that the hard work is far from over			0
" we can not be complacent , and @entity107 @entity10 is continually assessing the situation and scenario planning for all eventualities , " @entity9 said			0
" additional scientific resources , manpower and vessels can be utilized at short notice , should the situation change			0

@entity5 's @entity18 platform in the @entity3 began leaking gas on sunday
currently , about 200,000 cubic meters of gas a day are leaking into the water
two methods are being tried to stop it : drilling relief wells and *plugging* it up
a @entity10 official says the environmental risk appears to be minimal
