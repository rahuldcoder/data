@entity0 -- when @entity5 economist @entity4 coined the term @entity6 at the turn of the century -- referring to @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , countries he predicted would be future economic powerhouses -- it was difficult to imagine how big an impact the acronym would have			1
in the following years , the four @entity6 countries formed a federation that has met annually since 2009 to discuss their role in the global economy			0
" who would have ever dreamt that there would be a @entity6 political club ? it certainly is n't something that i ever imagined , " @entity4 , now chairman of @entity24 , told @entity1 's @entity25			1
the @entity6 partnership took a new turn last december when its four members invited @entity30 to join them at their third heads - of - states summit , to be held in @entity32 this month			1
but the news of the formal invitation , which came after persistent lobbying by the @entity30 government , has left some economists puzzled			0
according to @entity4 , @entity30 's economy of about $ 350 billion ca n't come close to matching the prospects of the @entity6 countries , which account for about half of global growth			1
" it is nowhere near constituting a @entity6 , and without staggering productivity improvements and major immigration or improvements in birth rates , etc. , it is never going to get there , " said @entity4			2
some analysts argue that @entity30 is simply too small to join the group of the world 's top - four major emerging markets			1
its population of about 50 million can not be compared to the @entity6 nations , which represent around 40 % of the world 's people			1
but @entity30 officials have said that it is the country 's strategic importance that matters and not its size			1
in december 2010 , following the @entity6 nations ' invitation , @entity30 's minister of international relations and cooperation @entity64 said : " the rationale for @entity30 's approach was in consideration of a matter of crucial importance to @entity6 's member states -- namely the role of emerging economies in advancing the restructuring of the global political , economic and financial architecture into one that is more equitable , balanced and rests on the important pillar of multilateralism			1
" @entity4 said : " @entity30 has played on the notion that because they do have developed markets and @entity88 governing standards in some areas they 've said ' look , we are the gateway to the rest of @entity30			2
' " he said this argument had some legitimacy but added that it would be interesting to see how it would resonate with the rest of the countries on the continent			0
" what intrigues me is whether other big @entity30 countries accept that and i doubt that @entity104 is going to be very happy about that , " @entity4 said			2
" in the context of the continent , @entity104 is the place that really matters , " he added , pointing to the country 's 155 million population			0
@entity104 has been identified by @entity24 as one of the nations that constitute the " @entity114 " group -- a phrase used to describe the 11 most - populous countries from the emerging world after the @entity6 block ( besides @entity104 , these are @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and the @entity128 )			1
@entity4 says that within that group , there are four countries that could potentially join the @entity6 block			1
" @entity127 , @entity121 , @entity125 , and @entity119 are big enough to stand on their own feet and are increasingly similar economies to the so - called advanced ones of the four @entity135 , " he said			0
when asked whether the @entity6 label would bring with it a huge degree of international investment interest for @entity30 , @entity4 remained cautious			2
" being part of the @entity6 political club does n't guarantee that you are going to be regarded as a @entity6 economically , " he said			0
" at this particular point in time , just because @entity30 has been accepted into that club does n't change the way that i 'll think about it in terms of how we focus on what constitutes a @entity6 or not and whether it affects others in terms of investment flows			2
" but @entity4 is not entirely negative			0
he urges @entity30 leaders to be bolder about basic policies to boost productivity and not be too concerned about which " club " they belong to or not			0
he said : " stop thinking that the world owes @entity30 something for its past and do things to create a better environment where you can attract a lot more international businesses			0
" and most importantly , embrace all your own people in a competitive , open way and find everybody jobs -- unemployment in @entity30 is a huge dilemma still			0
" @entity25 and @entity170 contributed to this report .			0
