@entity0 -- @entity2 has never voted for @entity3			1
he has no connection to her paid staff			0
and he is not collecting a paycheck from a cadre of groups anticipating a @entity11 presidential run in 2016			1
all of this bothers him			0
@entity2 , a 23 - year - old " @entity11 - ologist " from @entity13 , devotes much of his online life to supporting , defending and responding to her every move			1
in what he calls his " own little war room " -- his computer and @entity23 account -- the @entity18 employee has carved out a space as one of @entity11 's most ardent unpaid supporters			1
" i have yet to vote for @entity3 , " said @entity2 , who was too young to cast a ballot the last time she was on one			1
" i am really looking forward to fixing that in the coming years			0
" @entity2 is an unsalaried @entity11 warrior			1
and he is n't alone			0
all over the @entity36 , bloggers and their circles of friends with no backing from the @entity11 orbit defend the former first lady from attacks			1
while their defenses do n't have the weight of a @entity11 spokesperson or a former top aide , they are influential in their small community of friends and family			1
and they are standing up for the person they hope becomes the next president			0
" i am very , very passionate obviously about @entity3 , " @entity2 said , if that was n't already clear			1
" i just want to make sure that @entity3 has , if she does run , a kind of presence on social media that she has n't always had			1
" @entity2 is dogged and devout			0
he regularly tussles with reporters			2
" i do n't know if @entity59 still hates me or not , " he said referring to a @entity57 reporter he sparred with over a story			0
and he touts @entity11 's many appearances			1
" she was so good last night , " he tweeted after @entity11 's sit - down on the @entity62			1
why does he do this ? " when i see a story that is like , ' yuck , ' i feel like i should just stick up for my girl , " he said with a laugh			1
since may 2012 , @entity2 has tweeted nearly 30,000 times			0
most of them -- especially recently -- have been about @entity11			1
and while he only has 780 followers , many of those include reporters following @entity11 and representatives from the groups looking to help her if she runs again			1
@entity11 's unpaid army does far more than tweet			1
some , like @entity79 , have devoted years to blogging about her every move			0
since 2008 , @entity79 -- who keeps her identity private because of her paid employment -- has kept detailed records of @entity11 's comings and goings , including nearly every speech she delivered as secretary of state			1
the process , is admittedly , consuming			0
" you have to find ways to squeeze it in , " she said			0
" i cheat a little bit ( and blog ) during a lunch hour or something like that			0
but most of the time i do it at night			0
" still 4 @entity79 started her blog after @entity11 ended her presidential campaign in 2008			1
she began to write about @entity11 's events at the @entity106 and once @entity11 stepped down as @entity108 's top diplomat in 2013 , still 4 @entity79 began writing about @entity11 on the paid speaking circuit			1
" i see it as documentation , " still 4 @entity79 said about her blog			0
" i want to be able to go back and look at this speech or look at that speech			0
" amid all the glow for @entity11 , there is also pushback against her critics			2
when the @entity119 's conservative blogger @entity118 wrote a lengthy critique of @entity11 's time at @entity122 responded to what she called " repetitive and tiresome ... empty bloviating " from @entity125			2
there is more to the online response , though : people like @entity2 and still 4 @entity79 have received a little notoriety for their persistence			2
ask people within the @entity11 universe about @entity2 and they laugh about his exuberance			1
though he was never paid , @entity133 sent the @entity11 devotee to a finance meeting earlier this year to act as an example of a " grassroots supporter			2
" still 4 @entity79 's blog receives upwards of 10,000 hits a week			0
as of late -- given @entity11 's book tour and regular appearances -- the blog can gets as many as of 2,500 clicks a day			2
and when @entity79 met @entity11 at a @entity144 book singing this year , she was sure to mention her blog			2
according to blogger , @entity11 responded , " @entity79 ! i love it			2
yeah , i love it			0
" there is a downside to all of this , too			0
both @entity2 and still 4 @entity79 are building a online record of their thoughts and feelings about @entity11 and that record -- at some point -- could come back to haunt them			1
what 's more , in the anything goes nature of a campaign , comments made by @entity11 followers and fans can blow up into bigger stories			1
what happens when those fans have years of logs and comments that opposition groups could cull ? " to the extent that the actors join @entity3 's campaign or official groups that support @entity3 's campaign , their views and statements online become relevant , " @entity172 , executive director of @entity173 , an @entity174 , told @entity1			1
still 4 @entity79 's post- 2008 actions seemed to recognize this			0
shortly after @entity11 conceded defeat to @entity186 after a bitter primary battle , the blog took a negative , sometimes anti-obama turn , still 4 @entity79 told @entity1			2
after giving it some thought -- and after @entity11 patched up her relationship with him -- the blogger decided to delete some of those posts			2
" i am reading her book now and when i read the first chapter it was like tearing a scab off a wound of something , " still 4 @entity79 said , capturing how she is still hurt over that campaign			0
" that primary season was so brutal			0
... i removed a lot of the pages from june 2008 to the general election campaign			0
" but @entity11 's previous run might not be her last			2
so what if she runs again , how much work are these devotees willing to commit ? and is all of their internet devotion an audition for something bigger ? " i would love it if a role is available for me			2
if there is one , i would love it , " @entity2 said			0
" but whether or not i get an official role wo n't stop me from doing work on social media			0

@entity11 followers devote online presence to supporting and defending @entity3
many have jobs , but they use *downtime* to tussle with reporters and tout @entity3
" i feel like i should just stick up for my girl , " said a " @entity11 - ologist "
*anti-clinton* groups say if these people go to work for @entity11 , their comments are fair game
