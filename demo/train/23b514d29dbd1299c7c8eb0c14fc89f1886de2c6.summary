-- i get asked by political candidates all the time " what can i do to learn how to grow my @entity5 following ? " after last night , i have a new and simple answer			0
" or at least , watch and emulate @entity7 's savviest tweeter			1
@entity7 drivers and politicians have the same objective on @entity5 : grow an echo chamber of supporters for unfiltered communication to build loyalty			1
in one incident during monday night 's @entity17 , a 28 - year - old @entity7 driver named @entity19 delivered perhaps the most useful campaign schooling on the keys to effective use of the fastest growing social media tool			1
by the time most @entity25 politicians were asleep monday , a freak accident caused a 200 - gallon jet fuel fire on the track in the closing stages of the rain - delayed @entity17 race			1
@entity19 ( his twitter handle is @entity32 ) , used his camera phone to take a picture from his car of the disaster in front of him and then tweet it out to his 55,000 followers			2
his tweet went viral instantly , ballooning his @entity5 following by more than 100,000 followers over the next couple of hours			1
as of this tuesday afternoon ( a 12 - hour stretch ) , his following was up 300 % to 201,000			2
that surge makes @entity19 one of the most followed figures in racing , but also way up there in the larger world of sports			0
as a reference point , the winner at @entity17 , @entity54 ( @ mattkenseth ) , has more than 72,000 followers and racing scion @entity57 ( @ @entity59 ) has around 91,000			0
@entity7 driver tweets from car , gains 100,000 followers to be sure , @entity63 's band is but a fraction of the ones behind early @entity5 adopters @entity66 of the @entity67 and @entity68 of the @entity69 -- but his number is now four times larger than the @entity5 following of one of baseball 's biggest names , @entity76 star @entity75 ( @ @entity77 )			1
mere stardom does not build a social media presence ; it takes regular tweets that are good enough to inspire followers to spread them further via re-tweets to their own networks			2
what can politicians take from this ? compared to nationally known politicians , many of whom are in the news every day , @entity19 's " instant " following is bigger than @entity92 's ( 147,000 ) , closing in on @entity99 's 351,000 , double sen. @entity93 's ( 73,000 ) and double the size of the @entity96 senator who is perhaps most talented at @entity5 's use , @entity98 ( 64,300 )			1
the relative sizes of those followings put into perspective how hard it is to grow an audience , what a big move @entity19 made in just a few hours and the huge potential for those who know what they 're doing on @entity5			0
how did that one tweet ( and the conversation that followed ) do it ? yes , it was about a sensational event -- a fire during a @entity7 race			1
but i would argue it was something more than that			0
it bore all the characteristics of effective communication on this most personal broadcast medium : 1 ) it was authentic , 2 ) it was revelatory to what the tweeter was thinking and experiencing , 3 ) it was time - sensitive , 4 ) it added value to a national conversation that was already ongoing			0
these same four lessons have great teaching values to political candidates and campaigns as they seek to build a following on social media and thus develop a new and powerful way to reach out to voters			0
a few have already heeded them			0
for starters , @entity98 ( @entity145 ) and sen. @entity146 ( @ @entity147 ) thrive on @entity5 because they do their own tweeting , unlike politicians who leave @entity5 duty to staff members -- it 's a personal medium and authenticity is the most important quality			1
second , we got a window into @entity19 's attitude : when it works in politics @entity5 reveals things about the candidate 's sense of humor or values as much or more than his or her positions			0
third , @entity19 's tweet did n't wait until the next business day or until he could get to pit row			2
it happened on track , and in the moment			2
finally , a good tweet becomes a viral sensation beyond one 's current pool of followers when it adds a new chapter to a broader conversation already raging			1
@entity63 's tweet did n't start a conversation about the jet - fuel fire , it fed it , and then steered it in a new direction			1
that 's why @entity5 is a must - use tool during key national events like debates , presidential speeches , major sporting events , etc. it 's like having 20 million of your closest friends in your living room			2
political candidates who take @entity5 seriously should be active in the conversations millions of @entity198 have during those big events , whether they are about politics or not			0
to put these two worlds together , imagine if @entity92 had been the first to react to @entity19 's on - track tweet and engaged the driver 's fans in " can - you - believe - it " conversation ? his own following would have grown -- adding new followers he likely would never give up			1
campaigns and elected officials should work hard at developing a @entity5 following that is organic and earned			0
it provides a mechanism to communicate directly to the people most interested in what they have to say , for free , and without the filter of a hostile opponent or a skeptical media			0
any questions ? just follow @ keslowski			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			2

@entity221 : @entity7 driver 's viral tweet monday could be *instructive* for politicians
he says tweet of track fire spiked driver 's *traffic* ; made him instantly a most - followed
he says politicians should try more to *connect* with voters in this same " in - the - moment " way
@entity221 : politicians should write their own tweets ; they should be organic
