@entity0 -- @entity3 's job crisis is a result of decades of shopping on credit and underinvesting in research to fuel new industries , says analyst @entity8			1
in a recent cover story in @entity10 and in a special on @entity1 this weekend			2
@entity8 traces the growing loss of faith in the @entity3 dream and the ways that technology and globalization have put millions of middle - class jobs at risk			1
the author and host of @entity1 's " @entity22 " spoke to @entity1 on thursday			2
here is an edited transcript : @entity1 : what can we do about the threat to @entity3 jobs ? @entity8 : the first thing we have to do is to stop doing what we 've been doing for almost 20 years , which is pretending we do n't have a problem			1
we 've been kicking the can down the road , we 've blamed other people , blamed other countries for these issues			2
and most important , we 've deluded ourselves that there is no crisis because we 've kept the economy going by overconsuming			1
from the 1950s , @entity3 had a very stable pattern of consumption			1
consumer expenditures made up between 60 and 65 percent of @entity44 [ @entity44 ] -- in the 1950s , the 1960s , the 1970s , that was the pattern			2
then in the early 1980s , that starts going up , and it goes up to 70 percent of gdp by 2001 and it stayed there ever since			2
now this would n't be a problem if we actually had that money , but we have been consuming using borrowed money for the last 20 years			2
so the average @entity3 household now has 13 credit cards , 40 percent of which have an outstanding balance			1
debt has gone from $ 700 billion in 1974 to $ 14 trillion now			2
a fundamental way to think about it is that we have to shift this economy from an over-reliance on consumption and move it more toward investment			1
@entity1 : how do we do that ? @entity8 : let 's talk about what we need first			1
one of the things i 'm struck by in talking to corporate ceos -- these are all real free - market types -- but they all agree that the key to getting growth and middle - class jobs back is that we make massive investments , investments in technology , investments in research and development , investments in infrastructure			1
that is in a sense , investing in the middle class , because that is investing in the industries of the future , the industries that will create middle - class jobs			2
we used to spend 3 percent of gdp on research and development			1
we do n't do that now even though @entity91 has raised it a lot			2
i would argue that we actually need to do a lot more than we did in the 1950s , because in the 1950s there were millions of jobs for semiskilled labor , manufacturing jobs , making steel , making cars			2
all those jobs are under enormous competitive pressure from both technology and globalization			2
and so we need jobs in the new industries , industries of the future , knowledge based industries , scientific industries			2
to get those jobs and to make sure that @entity3 companies dominate them will take huge investments			1
@entity1 : should they be government investments ? @entity8 : that 's what 's produced the semiconductor industry , it was government investment			1
that 's what created the internet			2
@entity123 may not have created the internet , but @entity125 certainly did			2
that 's the @entity127 venture capital group			2
and @entity22 , the technology that 's now fueling the next internet revolution , the mobile revolution , that was also a @entity127 project			2
those are now producing hundreds of billions of dollars for the private sector , all started by government funding			1
@entity8 : the middle class is being hollowed out there 's another urgency			1
just today in the news , on the front page of the @entity140 , @entity138 has developed the fastest computer in the world			2
why was that ? was it because of unfair trade practices or an undervalued currency ? no. it was because the government of @entity138 has made massive investments in technology ... in many of these areas we 've lost a lot of ground			1
@entity1 : how can the @entity3 pay for this ? @entity8 : i do n't believe in a free lunch			1
for 20 years we 've pretended that we can have our cake and eat it , too			0
we could have tax cuts and prescription drugs for the elderly and a war in @entity166 and @entity167 and nobody has to pay for it			0
the government did it just as individuals did it -- by borrowing			1
this is going to cost money and you 're going to have to raise revenue			0
the best revenue raising device is a consumption tax , sometimes called a value added tax , or a national sales tax			0
every industrialized country in the world has it			0
we are the only ones who do n't			0
if we were to have a 5 to 7 percent consumption tax , it would be the lowest in the industrialized world			0
it would raise a lot of revenue			0
you could set it up so that the revenues from that tax would only go into investment , none of it is for current expenses			1
and if there is a consequence of this tax , which is that @entity3 consume a little less , that ai n't the worst thing in the world either			1
@entity1 : you wrote in your piece in @entity10 about immigration and skilled labor			0
how is that a part of the equation ? @entity8 : perhaps the most intelligent investment we can make is in human capital , particularly in talented people in science , math and computers			1
so what do we do ? well we can try to revitalize science education in @entity3 , which we must do , but it 's going to be a long slog			1
we 've fallen quite far behind			0
but we have been this amazing magnet -- the brightest students in the world come to @entity3 because we have the best colleges and universities in the world , and we are also seen as a place in which people find it attractive to study and work			1
but then , after we train all these hundreds of thousands of students from all over the world , the cream of the crop , we throw them out of the country , we tell them do n't you dare work here , because that would mean you would invent here , and hire people here , create new companies here , file new patents here , pay taxes here			0
no , no , no , go back to your country			0
we 've trained them often at taxpayer expense			0
someone getting a computer science degree at the @entity253 is being trained at the @entity256 government 's expense and is then thrown out of the country			1
we do n't reap any benefits from it			0
this is a great investment strategy for the future of @entity138 and @entity262			1
but it 's a terrible investment strategy for the @entity3			1
@entity1 : what can be done ? @entity8 : [ @entity265 has suggested that everyone who gets a science or math phd in this country should be given a green card along with their degree			1
and i think that 's a wonderful idea			0
we should frankly make it incredibly easy for these people to stay here			0
they are the people who overwhelmingly create jobs			0
... within a year or two they begin to pay back into the system at multiples of what they might have ever cost			0
and yet because of the usual political paralysis and dysfunction , it is right now unthinkable that we would ever enact a program like that			0
on the contrary , we 're trying to throw more people out			0
@entity1 : you do n't think there could be consensus on this in @entity296 right now ? @entity8 : the problem in @entity296 is that the minute one side suggests something , the other side demagogues it			1
so the incentive to come to the center is vanishing			0
the minute you try to come to the center , if you 're a @entity307 , @entity304 will denounce you , @entity308 will denounce you			0
there will be a primary opponent in your district who will be able to raise money			0
@entity1 : will tuesday 's election change that ? @entity8 : no. i fear it will actually exacerbate it			1
a lot of @entity307 will get elected , will tell you they are mad as hell about the deficit , and the solution is to cut taxes			0
this is insanity , cutting taxes will create an even larger deficit			0
this is math , this is not politics			0
... in the face of the problems we have , to have one more experiment in the idea that if we cut taxes , this will somehow goose the economy , we 've been there done that			0
[ president @entity339 ] @entity339 had this massive tax cut and it produced almost no growth			0
what it did produce was an $ 800 million hole in the budget			0
@entity1 : how does education fit into the picture ? @entity8 : the countries that have been able to maintain a manufacturing base , such as @entity350 , are really worth studying			1
the @entity350 have high taxes , they have lots of regulations , they have strong unions and yet they 've seen their imports increase year after year			0
they 've weathered the economic crisis very well , they 've had 15 months of falling unemployment numbers , and why is that ? because they have really focused on scientific education , technical education , apprenticeship programs , retraining			0
they focus on high - end manufacturing , they train and retrain their workers			0
we do n't have any such systems in @entity3			1
we need there to be more of a coordinated effort by government , business and educational institutions -- a triangle of training			1
we 've been too cavalier about letting skills of higher manufacturing erode among @entity3 workers			1
that work has not gone to @entity262 or @entity138 , that work has gone to @entity350 and @entity386 and @entity387 , other high wage , high income countries .			0

for decades , @entity3 have been overconsuming on credit , says @entity8
he says government has to fund major investments in research and development
@entity8 says investment will have to be paid for through new revenues
