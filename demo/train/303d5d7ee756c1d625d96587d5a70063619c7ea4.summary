@entity0 -- it 's hard to remember a presidential candidate who seemed more , er , unacquainted with the national dialogue -- or presidential prerequisites -- than @entity6			1
at first , he seemed a likable enough fellow			0
with exactly one idea : a 9 - 9 - 9 tax system			0
not a truly @entity12 - minted plan , since it includes a national sales tax , which @entity12 loathe			1
he was genial and a welcome addition to those early debates in which some of his fellow contenders seemed so humorless , angry and , in some cases , downright unfriendly			0
of course , @entity6 was unfriendly in that first moment in which he said he would n't allow any muslims to serve at high levels of government ( now a @entity6 classic ! )			1
but he backtracked , so the matter seemed to slip away			0
that 's because @entity6 was still a gadfly -- one of those folks never destined to get the center podiums at the debates			1
not serious , and not a serious threat			0
but as the weeks wore on , @entity6 became a phenom			1
maybe it was the @entity36 element			0
or the anti-politician crowd gone wild			0
eventually , he rose to the top of the pack			0
) but when the gaffes continued -- and the sexual harassment allegations surfaced -- it was no longer harmless			1
@entity6 became a parody of the empty - suit candidate , and his campaign proudly carried his baggage			1
a silly web ad with the campaign manager taking a drag of a cigarette said it all : grabbing for attention , blowing nothing but smoke			0
as for the sexual harassment allegations , the man - who - would - be - president alternately could n't recall them or could mildly recall them			1
the @entity62 , where @entity6 worked at the time , recalled one settlement just fine			1
but @entity6 never asked for the records to be released to clear his name , so his name remains far from cleared			1
and do n't expect the woman he recently dubbed " tutti - frutti " -- @entity71 rep. @entity70 -- to bail him out either			1
if this is the way @entity6 wants to behave , i suppose it 's a free country			1
but there is a cost to @entity12			1
the pursuit of the presidency is a serious undertaking			2
it requires ideas , beliefs , preparation , discipline , diligence			0
it is not vaudeville ( although it may sometimes look that way )			0
and it 's not a book tour or the ticket to a future tv deal ( although it may sometimes look that way			0
) to state the obvious , the president is the person who sends our sons and daughters to war , who manages the economy , who is our face to the world			0
so when i speak with @entity12 who have been around awhile and who have served in top government jobs , @entity108 posts or even in the @entity109 , they 're genuinely upset			2
not because they support @entity36 or @entity111 or @entity112 , but because they believe that @entity6 just might be sucking all of the oxygen out of the @entity12 race			1
and , more to the point , they worry his antics -- and his behavior -- could bleed onto the @entity12 field , as if the pursuit of beating @entity122 is somehow trivial			2
while the other candidates treat him like the silly uncle , he 's becoming dangerous to their own brand			2
sure , there are always inadequate presidential candidates			2
but here 's where @entity6 truly distinguishes himself : he defends his inadequacies , even wears them as a badge of honor			2
so what if he did n't know the president 's @entity139 policy ? " i 'm not supposed to know anything about foreign policy period			1
just thought i 'd throw that out , " he told the @entity141 this week -- the same day as the @entity139 gaffe			2
' i want to talk to commanders on the ground			0
because you run for president ( people say ) you need to have the answer			0
no , you do n't ! " oh yes you do			2
@entity111 spent days trying to recover from a brain freeze in which he could n't remember the name of a government agency he wanted to eliminate , because he knew he made a real mistake			0
it was bad , but it was n't as bad as @entity6 's @entity139 moment			1
" the only thing @entity111 could n't remember was the name of a @entity108 agency , " @entity158 , @entity12 political consultant who is unaffiliated with any of the campaigns , told @entity1 's @entity160			1
" for @entity6 , it looked like he could n't remember what he actually believes			1
" so far , no other candidates are defending @entity6 's behavior and lack of serious intent or world view			1
no one is saying it 's a good thing not to know what side we are on in @entity139			2
but they 're not hitting him for it either , as they should			0
and who is going to be the first serious @entity12 candidate to come out and say more about the harassment charges other than calling them " troubling ? " i 'll give you this : it was far worse with @entity186			1
after she was chosen as @entity189 's running mate , everyone whispered she was inadequate -- but said nothing publicly			0
in trying to win , the party became complicit in defending an indefensible choice			0
that ca n't possibly happen again			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			2

@entity196 : @entity6 seems to know little about national issues , presidency
she says he has n't adequately dealt with allegations of sexual harassment
@entity6 seemed to have little sense of @entity71 policy on @entity139 , @entity196 says
@entity196 : other @entity12 candidates should *challenge* @entity6 on his lack of *fitness* for candidacy
