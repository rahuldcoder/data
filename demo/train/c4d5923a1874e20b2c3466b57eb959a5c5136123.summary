-- who says the media are n't interested in good news ? @entity4 has been broadcasting lots of it for @entity6 this week			1
never have so many gray clouds had silver linings as those hovering over the hapless @entity11 candidate and his deflating campaign			0
i bring you this report after having ventured into @entity17 's " @entity16 , " and believe me , his initial shout - out urging viewers to exercise " caution " before watching is fully , if unintentionally , appropriate			1
apparently in @entity21 , " no - spin " means " i am now going to share my news - based fantasies			2
" the wednesday broadcast featured @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , an a-cappella chorus humming @entity17 's favorite tunes : that the mainstream media is rooting for @entity32 ; that the polls consistently misrepresent a race that is still a dead heat ; that @entity6 will re-emerge from this autumnal swoon by winning the october 3 debate through his superior if often - invisible oratorical skills ; that @entity6 is in decline simply because voters do n't yet understand the necessity of top - end tax cuts , the sanctity of corporate profits and the horror of social welfare spending run amok			1
across its programs , the @entity4 mantra is " there 's still plenty of time			1
" that 's a truism , but chanting the obvious is not among the standard definitions of journalism			0
institutionally , @entity4 is in denial about the state of the campaign			1
@entity6 is looking very weak very early			2
the attempt to avoid reporting this state of play in a " fair and balanced " way is producing comical results			0
stylistically , the @entity17 quartet may be on to something new			2
we 've had mainstream journalism , alternative journalism , conservative journalism			0
this appears to be vaudeville journalism			0
wednesday , the verisimilitude of the performance was maintained by the illusion that of the four , only @entity28 is a stand - up comic			0
@entity72 : why are candidates silent on @entity74 ? @entity27 's role is nuttily professorial			0
he has adopted one of those erasable white slates popularized by the late @entity78			0
on it he scribbles integers with plus or minus signs			0
these , he alleges , are the amounts being added to president @entity32 and / or subtracted from @entity6 by such daredevil organizations as the @entity84 , the @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity0 , @entity88 and the co-opted poll - averagers at the website @entity90			1
bottom line : this vast conspiracy is downgrading @entity6 three to nine points by using screens that overstate the votes of blacks , @entity98 , @entity99 , women and the young			2
@entity26 , who is beginning to bear a waxen resemblance to @entity102 , explained , i think , that pollsters cheat by using false baseline figures from previous elections			0
@entity26 did n't have time to explicate fully how every news organization except @entity4 has signed up to help @entity32 by disseminating these cooked figures			1
even so , @entity17 thanked @entity26 for explaining polling mysteries he said he had not previously understood			2
opinion : why @entity6 's rallies are a waste of time the effect was somewhat spoiled by an unscripted guest from reality , @entity116 , the scholarly political scientist from the @entity118 , who immediately dismissed @entity26 ' rant as " grassy - knoll " statistics			1
he added that the poll averages on @entity90 had things about right			0
@entity32 was ahead by about four points nationally			2
of the big - three swing states , @entity116 said , perhaps in order not to appear rude to his host , only @entity126 is still close			0
the presence of @entity28 is apparently driven by commercial considerations			0
he and @entity17 now have a lecture - circuit act that is selling out in such venues as @entity135 and @entity136			0
the closest i 've heard @entity28 come to elegant public - policy analysis was to call @entity32 a " crap president " earlier this week			0
as a nod to factuality , @entity17 does call @entity28 a " satirist " and , less plausibly , an @entity146 expert , due to his badly reviewed stint on @entity143			0
in any event , it 's hard to imagine anyone with a master 's in public policy from @entity152 , which @entity17 has , consulting @entity28 on an important national election -- unless there 's money in it			1
which brings us to the interesting case of @entity17 himself			1
@entity17 is no dummy , and he did work as a broadcast news professional before veering into infotainment with " @entity164 " and the @entity4 gig			1
for all his pugnacity , these days @entity17 has the look of a man doing beautiful pirouettes on increasingly thin ice			0
he 's clearly angling to survive a @entity6 train wreck with some credible deniability by leaving the delusional commentary to @entity27 et al			1
and hinting at his suppressed misgivings about @entity6 's chances			1
opinion : for @entity11 , it 's the social issues , stupid he 's not a man easily knocked off balance by contrary evidence			0
thursday he opened with @entity4 's own poll , which presumably lacked the evils defined by @entity27 and @entity26			1
it showed @entity32 's favorability up by 51 % to @entity6 's 48 %			1
it was , from a @entity190 point of view , a nicer number than @entity32 's five point head - to - head lead , 48 % to 43 %			2
cannily , he drops in terms such as " in fairness to @entity32 , " praises the president 's campaigning skills and takes note of criticism of @entity6 by other conservatives			1
he hangs his hat on the observation that october 3 is @entity6 's last chance to get back in the race			1
this leaves him room to turn around if the polls -- we 're talking the real ones here -- do n't			0
@entity17 's newest hedge , unveiled with @entity4 's bleak new poll , is that the " likability " factor gives @entity32 an advantage with " uninformed , casual voters			1
" i think there 's a secret behind @entity17 's trademark smirk			2
were it in his interest to say what 's on his mind about the candidates ' performance to date , he 'd almost certainly admit that @entity32 has come on like a superstar candidate of the @entity229 ilk , and so far @entity6 is one of the biggest duds in @entity232 presidential elections			1
right now , @entity4 ' general excuse for @entity6 is that he 's not getting his " message " across			1
i 'll tune in from time to time to see when the news from the real world arrives in the @entity4 studios			2
the message of @entity6 's tooth - and - fang financial - market capitalism is driving down the polls , and the messenger is coming across as an unlikable empty suit , even when he ditches his tie and jacket			1
at a certain point , campaigns in early decline begin to reek of impending defeat			2
i ca n't wait to see how they spin that in the no - spin zone			0
meanwhile , we can contemplate the dilemma of another @entity17 regular , the @entity254 in the @entity255 , aka pollster @entity253			0
he 's telling @entity17 the race is tied within the margin of error around 46 % or 47 %			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity261 .			0

@entity263 : @entity4 has been *contorting* to deliver good news for @entity6 's campaign
he says commentators ' spin *attributes* @entity32 gains to media *distortion* , voter ignorance , etc.
@entity261 : @entity17 says *evenhanded* things for deniability if spin is wrong , @entity6 fails
@entity261 : it will be interesting to see @entity4 spin if campaign should begin to reek of defeat
