@entity0 -- this week i was sent on a three - day work trip to @entity0 because , for some unfathomable reason , these people trust me outside the confines of my cube			1
generally speaking , i do n't mind being there			1
nevertheless , they were sending me out on an assignment with real journalistic merit			1
( mind you , this was n't it			1
this will make you dumber			0
) so , on the morning of my flight i poked around several sites to see what was trending in the @entity22			0
surely there was something locally interesting going on that people were talking about all over the @entity26 -- something culturally relevant and noteworthy that could give us a deeper glimpse into the psyche and spirit of @entity0			1
conclusion : it seems they like a sports team known as the @entity34			0
fortunately , when the rest of the @entity26 gives you @entity34 , there 's always @entity38			2
and after a simple search for " @entity0 , " i found a newly uploaded photo that was becoming somewhat popular with users on that site			1
the image showed wall art from somewhere in the city depicting one of @entity48 's @entity47 throwing a vitamin and yelling , " @entity50			1
" locally interesting ? not really			0
but it was popular on @entity38 , and that 's good enough for me			2
i have fairly low standards			0
which is to say , i have none			0
) later i learned the art was actually the character dr. @entity61 , who i believe was an alter ego of @entity64 -- the @entity66 plumber who got freaky with a princess in the @entity68			1
i was n't immediately aware of this because my fascist parents would n't let me have a @entity48 as a kid			1
i admit it was a bit of a first - world problem , but to this day i 'm still bitter to be the only one from my generation who does n't know the secret " @entity76 " cheat code to " @entity78			1
" speaking of my parents ... this is the part of the column where my dad turns to my mom and asks , " what the hell is he talking about ? " and then my mom says , " some sort of video game thing			2
" and then he says , " this is stupid			0
" and he 's right			2
but finding dr. @entity61 was a good excuse for an urban adventure in @entity0			1
and a short flight later i was there , walking through the terminal at @entity98 , which is the city 's way of immediately reminding visitors to use @entity102			2
as soon as i checked into my hotel i quickly logged onto @entity38 and found that some of the commenters had already discussed the art 's location			2
dr. @entity61 was in @entity109 at the corner of @entity111 and @entity112			1
also on that corner ? nothing you ever need to see			0
so , after a short ride downtown on the @entity118 train and wandering about with the help of maps on my @entity121 , i finally spotted the art off in the distance			0
@entity124 ! right ahead ! there it was			0
that thing i saw on the @entity128 ! sadly , it was a feeling similar to poking your head through the sun gate at @entity133 and seeing the ancient ruins for the first time after four days of hiking the @entity136			0
only , @entity133 is one of the most amazing wonders on the face of the planet			0
and this was dr. @entity61 throwing a vitamin			1
anthropologists wo n't be knocking on my door			2
but i guess it says something about the spirit of discovery and the possibilities that stem from random curiosities found online			2
there 's usually fun involved with a completely pointless adventure			1
without dr. @entity61 , i would n't have ventured off into this particular part of town			1
i would n't have enjoyed roasted pork and wonton soup at a little hole - in - the - wall called @entity159			1
and i would n't have met two really nice tourists from @entity161 on the subway			2
granted , i might have otherwise napped and built a small fort out of my hotel bed sheets			0
so , that was kind of a lost opportunity			0
but , still ... totally worth it			0
the moral of the story is this : somewhere in your city there 's something completely unimportant and you should totally go see it			0
the world is a strange , dirty place			0

" apparently this matters " takes a *closer* , off - *kilter* look at *topics* getting *traction* on *social* media
this week , a photo of " @entity61 " *graffiti* leads @entity188 on a trek through @entity0
even the most pointless discoveries online can lead to an *entertaining* real - world outing
@entity188 's parents did n't let him have a @entity48 -- not that he 's bitter
