editor 's note : @entity2 has written about movies , music and culture for the @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and the @entity9			1
he lives in @entity10 , @entity11			2
@entity2 says we want to relive @entity14 's youth , not the sad and bizarre aspects of his later life			1
( @entity17 ) -- seconds after the news first hit the airwaves , your own shock merged with everyone else 's in the immediate vicinity			2
and you could feel it rolling through the rest of the planet like a runaway diesel			0
as with most things you neither expected nor wanted to hear , you thought that there had to be more to it than what was being said			0
especially because it was @entity14 , who seemed too dominant , too other - worldly and , more than anything , too complex to be brought down by anything as simple as cardiac arrest			1
and also because most of what we 'd been hearing about @entity14 's personal life over the last decade and a half had been bizarre , sordid and sad			1
it was to those aspects -- the deepening isolation , the child molestation trials , the financial woes , the " @entity14 " moments like that 2002 interlude on the balcony with the baby -- that the talking heads on tv devoted tentative attention within minutes of the official announcement			1
the commentariat presumed it had a responsibility to poke those embers for clues of something beyond the single , dreadful fact of @entity14 's death			1
even if we did n't care for this conversation , we had been conditioned by the most recent events to wonder , deep down , if there was something stranger or more unpleasant attached to his passing			0
but acceptance came easier -- and sooner -- than any of us expected last night			0
and when it did , we wanted the talking heads to go away and leave us with our memories ... and nothing but the good ones , thank you very much			0
we wanted the loop of performances and hit singles			0
retrieve for us , please , the electricity of the 10 - year - old wunderkind who literally leapt into our consciousness in that shattering year of 1968 with " @entity82 " and " @entity83			0
" let us see that transfiguring moment 15 years later at the @entity86 tv special when @entity14 seized dominion over the pop firmament with his shattering , moon - walking recital of " @entity91			1
" we wanted the videos -- " beat it , " " @entity94 , " " @entity95 , " " @entity96 " and all that incredible , unearthly dancing			1
that was all we needed to see and hear			0
save the armchair psychoanalysis for later			0
no one would have understood or indulged such yearnings as quickly or as intuitively as @entity14			1
as surely as he was the @entity14 , @entity14 was also a high priest of wish fulfillment			1
his performances as both precocious child and child - like adult made growing up or growing old the only unimaginable things in the known world			0
this @entity110 mystique even became part of the @entity14 brand to the point of naming his combination of retreat and theme park the @entity117			1
the promise of eternal youth was embedded in pop music way before @entity14 and his four brothers emerged from the grit of @entity123 , @entity124 , to jump - start @entity86 's winning streak			1
but it 's when that promise expands to shatter boundaries and expand possibilities beyond @entity131 parameters that pop music becomes pop phenomena			2
and @entity14 , in the early 1980s , was a pop phenomenon powerful enough to pool together previously polarized audiences -- heavy metal , disco , funk -- and get them all on the same bandwagon			1
only twice before -- with @entity141 and the @entity142 -- had the cultural landscape been changed as decisively by a pop star			0
it has n't happened since -- and may never happen again			0
certainly , " @entity95 , " the best - selling lp of all time , wo n't be surpassed because @entity147 have been superseded twice over by discs and downloads			1
@entity14 's off - stage public diffidence gave the impression that his transformations of both self and society were all happening by off - hand magic			1
but his wispy speaking voice belied a steely resolve to control his image , his artistry and his product			0
the energy he devoted to keep what he considered " negativity " at bay was meant to nurture his audience 's dreams of release -- and to maintain his primacy in the pop marketplace			2
even the eccentricities , at the peak of his influence , seemed calculated to promote , if not perpetuate , his product			0
but time ( by far , @entity14 's worst and most formidable enemy ) could n't stop even his most devoted admirers from wondering what drove him to change his appearance so drastically over the years			1
or why he wanted to both save the world and hide from it with the same ferocious intensity			0
if he 'd been able to stop the clock at 1985 or even 1987 ( the year of " @entity94 " ) , life would have been so much easier			2
setbacks and embarrassments were occasionally offset by a tour or show that transported us back to the better , happier times when we were willing to overlook real life for our most elemental dreams of release			2
we seek those dreams even more urgently now that we know , for certain , that we 'll never again see him on stage -- the one place where he was happiest and most assured			0
but perhaps the hardest dream to give up -- and the reason so many people in so many countries were almost physically leveled by yesterday 's news -- is of finding common ground and sharing common awe in a song or a dance or a single act of outreaching , transcendent audacity			2
however divided ( or worse ) we may have felt about @entity14 at the end , we cherish how he brought out the best in us at the beginning			2
whatever the days ahead , that will be more than enough for now , forever			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2
