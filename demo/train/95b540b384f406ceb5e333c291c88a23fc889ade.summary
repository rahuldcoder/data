@entity0 , a tight end for the @entity1 , came home monday night after a tough loss to the @entity4			1
it was late and surely he was worn out			1
he turned on the television and saw everything that was going on in @entity8 , @entity9 , in the wake of the grand jury decision			1
as he fixated at the screen , his heart hurt for the people there			1
the next day , he started to deal with his emotions -- and there were many			1
@entity0 , in his 11th @entity19 season , likes to write down his feelings , so throughout the day he jotted them on his @entity22			1
while sitting in a @entity24 parking lot as his wife shopped , @entity0 went back and put the notes together into an emotional @entity28 post			1
one you 've probably heard about			2
that post has 427,000 shares and more than 760,000 likes			1
there were 78,000 comments at last look			2
in 611 words , @entity0 writes he is angry , frustrated , fearful , embarrassed , sad , sympathetic , offended , confused , introspective , hopeless , hopeful and encouraged			1
he told @entity38 's @entity37 on friday the two sections that resonated the most with him are the ones about introspection and encouragement : -- i 'm @entity44 , because sometimes i want to take " our " side without looking at the facts in situations like these			2
sometimes i feel like it 's us against them			2
sometimes i 'm just as prejudiced as people i point fingers at			2
and that 's not right			2
how can i look at white skin and make assumptions but not want assumptions made about me ? that 's not right			2
-- i 'm encouraged , because ultimately the problem is not a skin problem , it is a @entity62 problem			2
@entity62 is the reason we rebel against authority			0
@entity62 is the reason we abuse our authority			0
@entity62 is the reason we are racist , prejudiced and lie to cover for our own			0
@entity62 is the reason we riot , loot and burn			0
but i 'm encouraged because @entity69 has provided a solution for sin through ... his son @entity72 and with it , a transformed heart and mind			0
one that 's capable of looking past the outward and seeing what 's truly important in every human being			1
the cure for the @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity85 tragedies is not education or exposure			0
so , finally , i 'm encouraged because the @entity89 gives mankind hope			1
while the religious nature of that final section may turn some readers off , @entity0 says he thinks it points to a way that people of different races can solve some of the issues they face			1
" internally our sin makes us prideful , it makes us judgmental , it makes us prejudice , which leads to racism , it makes us lash out at people that do n't look like us			0
it makes us do all those things			0
it makes us lash out in anger and makes us point fingers , " he told @entity38			0
he finds the answers in the @entity89 of the @entity112			1
the message also spoke to many , many people			0
a comment about his boldness in proclaiming his faith landed 24,000 likes			0
@entity0 began his post facing his anger			1
" it 's ok to be angry and to identify your emotion as being angry , because like i said later we like to protect our own , " he told @entity38			0
" because of our life experiences , whether it is being a black @entity128 or a white @entity128 , because of stories that you 've heard over time , because of injustices that have happened or maybe being accused of something you did n't do or being accused of being racist when you 're not , we have these certain histories and we react because of those			1
" he said the key is to get past that first level of emotion			1
you have to understand why you are angry , he said			0
and then take it a step further			0
we need to understand the other side brings his own experiences to each situation			0
" it 's really important that we take a step back sometimes and think about the other side before we make accusations and assumptions , " he said .			0

@entity0 sometimes shares his *thoughts* about life on his @entity28 page
a post about the emotions he felt on day after @entity8 decision was read by many
he *closed* by saying @entity112 offers hope that we can get past *divisiveness*
@entity0 plays tight end for the @entity1
