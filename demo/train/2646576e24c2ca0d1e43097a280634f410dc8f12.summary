-- despite all the talk about next - generation gaming consoles , pc gaming is still going strong , and with it , demands for more powerful machines to play those games continue to grow			1
titles such as " @entity7 " and " @entity8 " are drawing legions of players to their computers to play games , pushing the limits of towers and laptops			0
@entity16 , a high - performance gaming hardware manufacturer , wants to let gamers skip the tower entirely and go straight to its laptop , pushing its hardware to meet the needs of those players with the newly redesigned @entity24			1
the original @entity24 was released in august 2011 , and while ceo @entity25 said the laptops were selling so fast the firm could n't keep them in stock , some gamers wanted more performance from the sleek 17 - inch laptop			1

externally , the new blade wo n't look much different than its predecessor			0
