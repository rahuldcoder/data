all other arguments aside , the @entity0 should not militarily intervene in @entity2			1
regardless of what might be said by politicians , @entity2 or not , @entity0 intervention to aid @entity6 in the fight against the @entity8 in @entity2 and @entity9 ( @entity10 ) does not constitute a solution to the current crisis , nor does it work towards one			1
far from it : direct military intervention by a western state -- even if prime minister @entity15 is requesting it -- would dramatically worsen the situation , and @entity10 , contrary to what pro-interventionists might say , would inevitably come out on top			1
while all options might , as @entity21 said this week , remain on the table at this point , some are more " on it " than others			0
indeed , it seems there is an international consensus that there is no appetite for @entity0 " boots on the ground " ( besides a very limited presence to secure national assets )			1
if there were to be any intervention , therefore , it seems likely it would take the form of " targeted strikes " from the air -- be they via drones , jets or missiles			0
and we are told that in that case , the focus would be exclusively on " @entity10 strongholds " in order to " minimize civilian casualties			1
" removed from the rhetoric of politicos , though , @entity0 intervention would bolster the propaganda efforts of @entity10 , for any attack would inevitably kill or injure @entity58 civilians , regardless of how well it had been planned or how good the intelligence behind it was			1
this would be good news for @entity10			2
indeed , the group actually relies on its ability to attribute civilian casualties to its enemies			0
by doing so , it bolsters the skewed jihadist narrative of international politics and presents an opportunity to exaggerate the non-existent " crusader threat " and defend the group 's false legitimacy			0
in short , the more civilians that die , the more events in @entity2 can be internationalized , and the wider the appeal of @entity10 can become			2
this effect would be grossly amplified if there were deaths at the hands of the @entity82 or the @entity83			0
after all , one of the central tenets of the jihadist narrative is the so - called " @entity87			0
" through this much abused paradigm , any international involvement in a conflict involving @entity90 is used by jihadists to fortify their ever - tenuous relevance in the modern world			1
and even were we to set aside all of the above , we still could not in any way justify intervening against @entity10 in @entity2 but not against @entity98 in @entity9			2
rightly or wrongly , this would be read by the region 's most vulnerable as incontrovertible evidence that the @entity0 will only intervene when its own economic prosperity is at stake			2
why else would it defend the rights of civilians here and not against @entity98 after his apparent use of chemical weapons ? the @entity109 must ignore @entity6 's plea for military assistance			0
we must not play into the jihadists ' hands			1
instead , we must focus on humanitarian assistance for refugees and diplomatic pressure on @entity15 to force him into profound and far - reaching reforms			0
in the long term , the only solution there can be is a political one : @entity2 's economically and politically marginalized @entity122 need to be brought back into @entity2 's decision - making process			0
but even if it is not our place to carry out military action , this is not to say that military intervention is categorically inappropriate			1
indeed , if the @entity2 national army can not pull itself together , i would argue it is absolutely necessary			0
however , it must be at the hands of a @entity58 - majority country , in order to diffuse the narrative of @entity0 armed forces once again attacking @entity90			1
if a country like @entity140 or @entity141 acts against it , @entity10 's " @entity87 " rhetoric would not have anywhere near the same impact			1
leaving its operational and strategic capacity to regional players , the @entity109 's focus needs to be on @entity10 's ideological heart			2
we need to undermine its greatest rhetorical asset : that @entity90 , worldwide , are under attack by the " @entity109			0
this can only be achieved with a policy of restraint .			0

@entity157 says @entity0 military intervention would play into @entity10 hands
jihadists use ' war on @entity163 ' to fortify their tenuous relevance to the modern world
to undermine that , there needs to be @entity0 restraint
@entity140 or @entity141 could *provide* *firepower* ; the @entity0 the humanitarian aid
