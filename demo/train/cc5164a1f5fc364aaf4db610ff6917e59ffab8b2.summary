@entity2 @entity1 prime minister @entity0 on wednesday announced " exceptional measures " to respond to the " change of scale " of the terrorist threat in the wake of deadly attacks two weeks ago in @entity2			1
@entity0 said close to 3,000 people in @entity1 with jihadist ties needed to be under surveillance -- and that the number of people with links to networks in @entity17 and @entity18 had increased by 130 % in the past year			1
in response to the threat , 2,680 new jobs will be created , of which intelligence services alone will account for 1,100 , he said			1
many of the new jobs will be dedicated to tackling the threat from online jihadism			1
@entity1 will allocate 425 million euros ( $ 490 million ) over the next three years to boost the fight against extremism , @entity0 said			1
these resources will be used to buy new equipment , such as bulletproof vests and better weapons for police officers			1
@entity0 also said a new bill would be presented in april aimed at reinforcing the intelligence services ' legal position in conducting surveillance			1
efforts for early detection of radicalization will be enhanced within the @entity42 , he said			1
people charged with or convicted of acts of terrorism will be placed on a list and required to report trips abroad or changes of address			1
other measures are aimed at preventing radicalization in prisons and online			1
internet companies and social networks will be expected to cooperate closely with authorities , @entity0 said			1
the prime minister also detailed the " consequences for those who attack the nation , " which may include removal from @entity1 territory for radical @entity63 , or loss of @entity1 citizenship			1
the latter measure will need to be validated by the @entity67 on friday			1
the costs of the new anti-terrorism provisions will be met through savings in other areas of public spending , @entity0 said			1
through these measures , he concluded , the government was sending a " message of relentless determination " to the @entity1 people			1
@entity79 ' announcement comes as @entity80 ramps up efforts against @entity83 extremism in the wake of the @entity2 attacks			1
the attacks this month against the satirical @entity88 magazine and a kosher supermarket have turned the spotlight on links between radical @entity63 in @entity80 and terror networks elsewhere			1
@entity95 's @entity94 affiliate , @entity93 ( @entity93 ) , has claimed to be behind the january 7 massacre by gunmen @entity98 and @entity99 at the offices of @entity88			1
and gunman @entity101 , who attacked the kosher grocery store on january 9 , proclaimed his allegiance to the @entity104 in @entity17 and @entity18 , or @entity105			2
the suspects in the @entity2 attacks may have urged their associates to leave @entity1 before the plot was carried out , law enforcement sources told @entity3			1
@entity80 authorities are concerned that about half a dozen people with ties to the terror suspects are believed to be in @entity18 and could return to @entity80 to launch more attacks , the sources said			1
a @entity117 official added the recent arrests across @entity80 are similar to the " hyper - reactivity " after 9/11 in the @entity120			1
" we 've become hyper - reactive to any suggestion of @entity63 extremism and are chasing a lot of ghosts out of an excess of caution , " the official said			1
" some are legitimate , and some are not			2
" from @entity130 to @entity131 and back : @entity80 's nightmare in a video released this week , a senior @entity93 leader and spokesman urged all would - be jihadists to wage war at home , when possible , as opposed to traveling abroad			1
" if he is capable to wage individual jihad in the @entity117 countries that fight @entity63 -- such as @entity120 , @entity141 , @entity1 , @entity142 , and others of the countries that represent the head of disbelief in waging war against @entity63 ... if he is capable of that , then that is better and more harmful , " said @entity148			1
he continued : " but if that is impossible , and he is able to serve his brothers on the front lines , then let him immigrate , for it is better			2
" an off - camera interviewer asked why attacks have abated in the @entity120			1
" by the grace of @entity159 the great ( and ) the almighty , we have made efforts in external work , and the enemy knows the danger of that , " @entity148 said			2
" we are preparing and lurking for the enemies of @entity159			2
we incite the believers to do that			2
" @entity2 prosecutor @entity170 told a news conference that progress has been made in the investigation into the attack carried out by @entity101 , but less so in the probe into the @entity99 brothers			2
@entity170 identified four suspects still in custody as @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 , giving only the first initial of their last names , and outlined details of the charges against them			2
none of the four men has been charged with complicity in the kosher market attack			2
the first three , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 , were present when @entity101 bought the @entity193 car that he used to reach the site of the attack			2
it was found parked near the @entity197 after the attack			2
the fingerprints of the fourth suspect , named as @entity182 , were found on one of the weapons that police discovered in @entity101 's secret apartment in @entity206 , authorities say			2
his dna was also found on a glove discovered at the scene of the crime , the prosecutor says			2
in the days leading up to the attack , @entity182 had exchanged 362 text messages and 18 phone calls with @entity101 , the prosecutor says			2
the two men met on january 5 , four days before @entity101 's attack			2
the four men in custody , all in their 20s , were among nine people arrested in a police operation friday			1
five other suspects held since friday were released monday night			0
amid heightened concern over the threat posed by radical islamists in @entity80 , @entity226 and @entity227 have cracked down on alleged extremists in recent days			0
@entity226 authorities continue the hunt for the ringleader behind a terrorist cell targeted in countrywide raids last week in which two suspects died			0
the suspected key link between senior @entity105 operatives in @entity18 and the @entity226 terrorist cell -- @entity226 - @entity241 @entity105 fighter @entity240 -- is still at large , a senior @entity226 counterterrorism official said monday			1
his last known location was @entity244 , the official said			0
one line of inquiry being looked at is whether @entity240 tried to fake his own death last year while fighting with @entity105 in @entity18 so that he could disappear off the radar screen of @entity117 intelligence services			0
in october , his family in @entity252 received word he had been " martyred , " his sister told a @entity226 newspaper			0
@entity226 investigators believe @entity240 , rather than dying on the front lines , traveled to @entity244 and suspect he was communicating by phone from there with the terrorist cell in @entity226			0
despite an international manhunt , involving both @entity120 and @entity80 intelligence agencies , @entity240 remains at large			0
the concern is he will return to @entity18 before he can found			0
the @entity226 prosecutor 's office , meanwhile , said wednesday that custody had been extended for three suspects arrested in last thursday 's raids			0
all three are charged with participation at the activities of a terrorist group and violation of weapons laws			0
one is also charged with armed rebellion , in a group , with premeditation			0
that last is @entity278 , who survived the police raid in @entity281 in which two suspects died			0
his attorney said he was not involved in terrorism , but was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time			0
the @entity244 authorities have also agreed to the extradition of an @entity291 suspect named as @entity292 , the @entity226 prosecutor 's office said			0
the extradition could take place in the following days			0
when he arrives in @entity226 , he will be brought before the investigating judge , who will decide on an arrest warrant , the prosecutor 's office said			0
another suspect , named as @entity299 , was arrested tuesday and charged with participation in the activities of a terrorist group			0
he 's due to appear before a @entity252 court on friday , the prosecutor 's office said			0
federal prosecutor @entity305 said last week that the alleged terror cell targeted in the countrywide raids was on the brink of an attack and planned to target police officers			0
meanwhile , police in @entity312 , @entity313 and @entity314 raided 13 properties linked to suspected radical islamists overnight monday to tuesday			0
the raids are part of the investigation into two alleged islamists who were arrested friday , identified as @entity321 and @entity322 , @entity312 police said			0
both of them are accused of providing logistical aid to @entity105			0
those subject to the raids have not yet been accused of any crimes , but had contact with @entity321 and @entity322 there are no indications that the group was preparing attacks in @entity227			0
@entity101 killed four hostages at the kosher grocery store in @entity2 before police killed him			0
he 's also believed to have killed a policewoman a day earlier			0
new surveillance video obtained by @entity3 purportedly shows @entity101 and @entity339 -- believed currently to be in @entity18 -- outside a @entity341 institution in @entity2			1
a source familiar with the ongoing investigation into the @entity2 attacks says there is a high degree of confidence that the video shows @entity101 and @entity339			0
the video was recorded at the end of august or beginning of september and stored on a security camera			0
the source says the nature of the video makes it clear that the couple were carrying out surveillance of possible targets for months before @entity101 launched his attack against the kosher supermarket			1
the video was stored because it showed possible signs of unusual activity at the location , says the source			0
@entity3 's @entity364 reported from @entity2 , and @entity365 wrote from @entity366			0
@entity3 's @entity367 , @entity368 , @entity369 , @entity370 , @entity372 - @entity371 , @entity373 and @entity374 contributed to this report .			1
