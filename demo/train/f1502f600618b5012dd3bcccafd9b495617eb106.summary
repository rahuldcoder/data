the @entity4 nurse 's aide who contracted @entity6 after treating virus - stricken patients in @entity9 is now free of the virus , her doctors announced tuesday after another test on her			1
@entity15 is clear of @entity6 , physicians at @entity14 hospital said			2
she received an initial test , which turned up no virus in her blood , doctors said sunday			1
more tests were administered to be sure she was virus - free			2
while @entity4 welcomes the good news about @entity6 , the @entity22 is doing more to help prevent the spread of the virus			1
the @entity26 said tuesday that all arriving passengers from @entity29 countries that @entity6 has hit hardest -- @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 -- must land in one of the five @entity22 airports that have enhanced @entity6 screening			1
those airports are @entity38 's @entity37 ; @entity40 's @entity39 ; @entity41 's @entity42 ; @entity44 's @entity43 ; and @entity45 in @entity46			2
on its website , the @entity26 shows how many people have been screened and then taken to health care facilities for further checks			0
@entity37 appears to be outpacing the other airports in screenings			2
also tuesday , the @entity53 announced that testing was underway at the @entity55 in @entity56 for an @entity6 vaccine ; and a trial for a second vaccine , initially developed in @entity60 , has started at the @entity61 in @entity62			1
the goal is to launch vaccine trials in @entity29 by january , said dr. @entity65 , the @entity53 's assistant director general for health systems and innovation			1
the initial vaccine tests are being given to volunteers in countries such as @entity71 , the @entity22 and @entity72			1
it is impossible to get @entity6 from the vaccines , @entity65 said , because they do not contain enough of the virus 's genetic material			1

that wo n't be determined until after test results come in			0

debate over experimental drugs the @entity53 said it is also visiting sites in the three countries most devastated by @entity6 -- @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity30 -- to see which treatment centers could participate in the testing of experimental @entity6 drugs			1
but there is debate among medical ethicists about the drug trials -- namely , whether to use placebos in testing			2
while some say placebos are necessary to gauge the effectiveness of drugs , others say it 's unethical to withhold treatment for a disease with a mortality rate of about 50 %			0
@entity111 gives new guidelines the news from the @entity53 comes a day after the @entity111 issued updated @entity6 guidelines , focusing on better protecting health care workers			2
dr. @entity116 , the director of the @entity111 , stressed the importance of more training and supervision , and he said no skin should be exposed when workers are wearing personal protective equipment , or @entity123			0
" we 're increasing the margin of safety with a real consensus guideline that has three key changes			0
