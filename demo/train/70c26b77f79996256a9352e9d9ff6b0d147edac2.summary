-- slouching over coffee in a booth at a @entity5 diner , @entity1 looks so ... @entity7 , you might think he was shooting a scene from the old sitcom			1
but this is a different @entity1 : a husband and father of three , who , at 55 , finds himself comfortably bemused by the strange intricacies of marriage			1
it 's his current obsession and the subject of the new show he 's coproducing , " @entity19 " -- a stand - up / reality - tv hybrid that features clips of real couples in real tussles , plus a panel of celebrity " experts " and a referee ( comedian @entity28 ) who ultimately declares the husband or wife in each standoff the winner			1
if you 've seen the show , you already know that the niggling mundanity of other people 's lives provides its share of laughs , yet @entity1 is expecting even more			1
" i hope it 's not grandiose to say , but maybe it 'll save a marriage here and there , " he explains			1
" i got ta believe that somewhere , someone out there is going to go , ' i 'm not the only one ! ' " @entity47 : this is a pretty big topic you 're taking on			2
@entity1 : i feel like @entity51 , frankly			1
i feel like the first person to explore the ocean			2
and we 're just gon na go out and search and -- @entity55 : @entity56			2
@entity57 : @entity56 is for caves			0
i 'm talking about oceanography			0
caves are small ; the ocean is vast			0
in the comedy business , you deal with scarcity all the time			0
you never have enough funny things			0
but in this show , it 's the exact opposite			1
you talk about , what 's a great sitcom ? what 's a great romantic comedy premise ? well , here it is : here 's a man and here 's a woman , and they have decided to shackle themselves together			1
let 's see how that works out			1
@entity0 : the definitions @entity1 thinks every couple needs @entity55 : tell me about the spat between you and your wife , @entity86 , that prompted the idea for @entity19 @entity57 : a friend of hers was over			1
i do n't even know what it was about , but we got into something			1
and the friend started to get uncomfortable and said , " maybe i should go			0
" and i hit upon the idea of , " no , you have to stay			0
you have to solve this for me			0
" and we each pleaded our case			0
@entity55 : who won ? @entity57 : well , it was n't me			1
but the simplicity of it was exciting			0
@entity55 : do you think there should be ground rules for marital fights ? @entity0 : the fight that can save your marriage @entity57 : the best piece of advice i received before i got married was , " be careful what you say when you 're in a fight , because it could stick in someone 's head			1
" i do n't think i 've ever said anything i really regretted			1
i 'm very sympathetic to women			0
i 've really studied wife - ology , and i know you 've got to figure out the feelings			1
@entity55 : so what 's your fighting style ? @entity57 : i can get very lawyerly when my wife and i get into a thing			1
i get very logical and i try and channel my emotion through that			0
@entity55 : well , that 's one approach			1
@entity57 : if you 're a man , you have to figure out what she needs to hear			1
so ask her : " what do you need to hear me say ? " and then just say it			1
that 's a very good way out of an argument			1
but then you have to act -- you have to say it like you mean it			0
even our kids have this thing where , if you say , " i 'm sorry , " they go , " no , say a nice sorry			0
if it 's not a nice sorry , it does n't count			1
" @entity55 : any other ground rules ? @entity57 : i 'm very big on staying in the room			0
in fact , i said this to my wife the other day : " i understand that you 're so upset that you just want to walk away			0
but , you know , i do n't care that it 's hard			1
" you stay in the room until you feel better			0
@entity55 : how about the classic , " do n't go to bed angry " ? @entity57 : i remember agreeing to that on the night of our wedding			2
i do n't think we 've kept it once			2
@entity0 : what 's wrong with being angry ? @entity55 : so monogamy -- is it natural ? something we ought to aspire to ? @entity57 : my personal viewpoint is this : the problem with humans is our heads are just way too big			2
and one of the greatest appeals of monogamy is the simplification of the mental process			0
i do n't have any friends who are n't faithful to their wives , but if i did , my main question would be , " who 's got time to figure all that out ? " it 's just too much work			1
the emotions that have to be disposed of , the values , the ethics ...			0
all i see is this gigantic amount of work for a fleeting pleasure			0
people should get married because they have finally seen the folly of being single : " oh , this is all just kind of a bad magic trick			0
i just keep bending over to reach for this wallet on a string			0
how much longer am i gon na do that ? " @entity55 : what 's one of the things you most like about being married ? @entity57 : i love being made fun of , if it 's done well			1
i love being brought down to size			1
@entity55 : and your wife is good at that ? @entity57 : yes			0
i feel like humor is the answer to everything			0
for example , let 's look at @entity206 and @entity207			2
now , there are some differences to the two situations			0
the biggest difference is , what can a guy who has humor do that a guy who does not have humor can not do ? you 're looking at a guy who knows how to make fun of himself , and a guy who has n't the first clue how to make fun of himself -- and the resulting difficulty			2
if you have a little bit of humor in the shaker and you can sprinkle that on , that 's your answer			2
@entity55 : so ultimately , is marriage worth it ? or is it the most foolhardy thing we could do ? @entity57 : no more foolhardy than " i think i 'll take human form for 75 years and try to negotiate the planet i see below me			2
" there 's a tremendous power and energy in sharing your life with another person			2
i 'm married ten years next week , and it 's as big a joy for me now as it was when we first started dating			2
i love these two puzzle pieces that do n't quite fit , you know ? somehow you make them fit			1
