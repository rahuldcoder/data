beginning to turn red , with my stomach fluttering as i begin to think about the busyness and complications of the fall			0
ever since i was a little boy , i 've thought to myself : ca n't it stay summer forever ? so what is it , exactly , that seems so wonderful about summer , and makes us so terribly regret its passing ? in a climate where four seasons are sharply distinct , it 's mostly about the long and lazy days when you can get up early , sit under a tree with a mug of coffee to watch the sun rise , or wander into the garden in bare feet			1
it 's about warm and green - leaved surroundings , and the aura of infinite time			2
this timelessness may be , of course , an illusion , but there 's no doubt that the pressures of everyday life , in summer , seem less pressing			1
even the night takes on a special quality in summer , with the crickets playing on their little musical instruments underneath the bedroom window as breezes push through the screens , offering a form of natural air conditioning			2
i 've even noticed that in summer dreams seem especially vivid , as if the membrane between sleeping and waking were somehow permeable			2
it 's not for nothing that we associate summer with childhood , as most children like nothing better than the last minute of the last day of the school year , when the bell rings and they are set free for two or three months , to run wild in the neighborhood , ride bikes , swim , play games			1
none of that boring stuff , such as reading and writing and arithmetic			0
long after our lives are governed by school bells and academic calendars , there is still a feeling of relief when the cold and slantwise rains of spring stop , when we can sit on the steps outside and feel the sun on our faces			0
in june , the summer stretches before us , tantalizing , full of possibilities			1
we somehow believe it will continue forever as we walk beside dusty country roads , seeing the corn " knee high at the @entity80			0
" but the corn grows tall , ripening as the days shorten			0
august arrives too soon , and time rushes to the brink of autumn -- what @entity85 in his memorable poem called " @entity87 " refers to as that " other fall we name the fall			0
" is this the @entity92 that he alludes to in this ominous way ? @entity85 tells us that the bird frames for us the essential question that everyone faces at the end of summer : " what to make of a diminished thing ? " our summer garden , like @entity102 , ca n't stay put			1
it 's impossible to sustain the idleness , the hopefulness , the sense of endless options that summer affords , however briefly			2
we begin to hear the waterfall in the distance as the stream quickens , gliding over the rocks			0
too easily we imagine the dying leaves of autumn , the icy winds , a feeling that once again we have entered the stream of life in a big way			0
on the other hand , we also like the fall , do n't we ? there 's a quickening of life as we gather our wits and launch again into life , full tilt			1
the pleasures of autumn , even its melancholy overtones , have also attracted a fair share of poets			0
but summer is summer , and it 's not easily replaced			2
as @entity133 arrives , with its last gasp of summery pleasures -- picnics and boat rides , family reunions , a table groaning with the best that gardens can offer -- i ca n't help but wish we were at the beginning , not the end , of this loveliest of seasons			1
i wish it were may , and that we could all join voices with the anonymous medieval @entity149 poet , who famously wrote : " summer is a-coming in ! / loud sing , cuckoo ! " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity154 .			1

as @entity133 arrives @entity154 ca n't help but wish summer were n't ending
@entity154 : what is so wonderful about summer and makes us regret its passing ?
he says it 's not for nothing that we associate summer with childhood play
@entity154 : the summer garden , like @entity102 , makes us feel that life is full of hope and possibilities
