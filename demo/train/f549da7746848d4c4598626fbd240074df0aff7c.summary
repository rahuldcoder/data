@entity0 , @entity1 -- alleged @entity5 camp guard @entity4 had no choice but to bring @entity7 to their deaths in extermination camps , @entity4 's defense argued monday as his long - awaited trial got under way			1
@entity4 , 89 , faces charges of being an accessory to about 27,900 murders during @entity15 but his defense attorney , @entity16 , said monday the court was imposing a " moral and judicial double standard			1
" the retired auto worker from @entity21 , @entity22 -- a native @entity23 -- was a prisoner of war during the conflict , and would have been killed had he not done what the @entity26 ordered , the defense team argued			1
the defense line that @entity4 was forced to help the @entity26 represents a change for the defendant , who has denied in the past that he was a camp guard			1
the guards forced to help the @entity26 were " victims , not culprits -- survivors , not murderers , " defense lawyer @entity16 said			0
higher - ranking @entity1 ss officers in a similar situation have been found not guilty of war crimes , the defense argued			1
the @entity0 state prosecutor brought the charges against @entity4 for his alleged role at the @entity43 death camp in @entity44 , where the @entity26 and their accessories killed at least 167,000 people , according to the @entity47			1
about 30 relatives of victims have joined the prosecution case			0
in @entity1 it is possible for the families to join the prosecution case as co-plaintiffs , representing named individuals who died in the death camps			1
if @entity4 is found guilty , it will not be only for 27,900 anonymous murders , but for the murders of victims specifically named by the co-plantiffs			2
there are very few remaining survivors of @entity43			0
@entity4 's defenders say he was a @entity65 prisoner of war at the @entity67 camp , where @entity26 trained prisoners to assist with the extermination of about 2 million @entity7 in occupied @entity44			1
those prisoners of war had no choice but to assist , the defense said			2
@entity4 was brought into the court in a wheelchair , accompanied by medical personnel and a @entity1 - @entity23 translator			1
he did not speak in the opening phase of the trial , and had his eyes shut most of the time			0
the trial is expected to last until may of next year			0
he was deported in may from the @entity81 to @entity1			2
the @entity1 court originally accused him of complicity in about 29,000 murders			2
the prosecutor 's office said it revised the number because some of those who had allegedly died in the camp when @entity4 was there were already dead during the transport to @entity43			1
@entity4 lost a @entity81 @entity94 case against his deportation			1
his lawyers had asked the high court to consider their claims that he was too ill and frail to be sent overseas			0
they also raised human rights and other legal issues			0
the @entity101 ruled earlier this year he was fit to stand trial			0
but doctors have restricted the time he can be tried each day to two sessions of 90 minutes each , said @entity106 , @entity0 state prosecutor			0
the accusations against @entity4 date to the late 1970s , when the @entity109 accused him of being a @entity5 guard known as " @entity111			1
" his @entity81 citizenship was revoked in 1981 , and he was extradited to @entity113 in 1986			0
@entity4 was convicted in an @entity113 court in 1988 and sentenced to death , but that conviction was overturned in 1993 amid evidence that someone else was " @entity111			2
" a federal court restored @entity4 's citizenship , ruling the government withheld evidence supporting his case			2
but his citizenship was revoked again in 2002 after a federal judge ruled his 1952 entry into the @entity81 was illegal because he hid his past as a @entity5 guard			0
@entity2 's @entity129 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 , a retired *autoworker* from @entity22 , denies any role in the @entity133
he says he was a prisoner of war during conflict , not a camp guard
@entity4 , 89 , moved to @entity1 after losing legal fight against deportation
