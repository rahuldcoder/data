-- an @entity3 man told police he " messed up " by killing a woman in @entity1 , then came clean , leading them to several more bodies in nearby @entity7 , hammond police chief @entity1 said monday			1
@entity1 stopped short of calling @entity8 a suspected serial killer , but left the possibility open if police are able to connect the convicted sex offender to any of the six women found in @entity7 over the weekend			1
" if we directly attach him to it , we can make that assumption , " he said , adding that @entity8 's statements lead authorities to believe there are " possible other victims			1
" some cases may date back 20 years , based on what @entity8 has told police , the chief said			1
text messages would be @entity8 's undoing , @entity1 said			1
@entity8 , 43 , ordered a prostitute through the backpage.com site serving @entity30 and arranged a friday meeting at a @entity32 in @entity33 with @entity34 , 19 , the chief said			1
the person who arranged the meeting , whom @entity1 described only as " a facilitator , " later texted @entity34 and received " suspicious texts " she believed were from @entity8 , the chief said			1
she and another person went to the motel to check on @entity34 , according to a probable cause affidavit			2
they found her body in a bathtub			2
using a phone number provided by the facilitator , police electronically tracked @entity8 down , the chief said			1
a search warrant obtained for the vehicle police believe @entity8 drove to the motel as well as his home yielded a number of items that connect him to the scene , according to the affidavit			1
the search turned up clothing similar to the clothing worn by a man captured on surveillance video leaving the motel room , the same brand of condoms found inside the room and a cell phone that matched the description of @entity34 's			1
in addition , @entity8 was wearing a shirt with a missing button			2
a button was found inside the room where @entity34 was killed			2
the police affidavit said the shirt @entity8 was wearing when police questioned him matches the button from the room			1
@entity8 told police he " messed up " and expressed surprise that he was found so quickly , @entity1 said			1
" he admitted his involvement in the @entity1 incident " and began leading police to other bodies in @entity7 , @entity1 said , adding that at this point , @entity8 is charged in only @entity34 's death			1
according to the affidavit , police found signs of a possible struggle in the motel room : a broken fingernail on the floor and the beds moved away from the headboards			1

@entity1 declined to say how the other five women died			0
as for a motive , @entity1 told reporters , " i do n't have a specific reason he does this			0
" the @entity7 homes where the bodies were stashed were all within a 5 - mile drive of each other			0
@entity8 cooperated , gave police descriptions and accompanied officers to certain locations , the chief said			1
asked why @entity8 chose to cooperate , @entity1 said he wanted to cut a deal with prosecutors but did n't provide further details			2
" it was just something he wanted to do			0
that 's all i can say , " he said			0
a man living next door to where one of the bodies was found told @entity0 affiliate @entity162 that he believes the crimes occurred recently			2
" somebody had to come in there like last week or something , because ( @entity169 ) and the water company were there turning off the power and stuff , so there was no one in there , " @entity164 said			0
