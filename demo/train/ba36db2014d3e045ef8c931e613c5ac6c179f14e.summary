-- @entity1 is extreme @entity2			1
in this booming metropolis all the wealth , inequalities , colors , flavors and passions of @entity2 are magnified to an almost unbearable degree			0
for many @entity2 , @entity1 is the place where dreams can come true			2
somewhere between 13 and 20 million people are squeezed into the city that is @entity2 's leading financial and industrial center and the home of the @entity17 movie			2
for countless migrants from all over the country , be they business school graduates , aspiring actors or destitute laborers , @entity1 is the place where dreams can come true			2
those who like to think of @entity2 as a land of tradition and mystery would be shocked by the way modern @entity1 has embraced western consumerism			1
in @entity1 the rigidities of @entity2 's traditional caste system are being replaced by a kind of brutal meritocracy in which the winners become extraordinarily rich and the losers struggle for survival			1
while @entity1 is fearlessly embracing modernity , minting millionaires and erecting skyscrapers , its infrastructure is hopelessly outdated and creaking under the weight of the city 's ever - expanding population			1
@entity1 's road traffic is legendary -- a chaotic melange of cars , mopeds , motorized rickshaws and red double - decker buses , seemingly fused together in a writhing , gridlocked mass. all big cities have deprived areas , but in @entity1 the deprivation is impossible to avoid			2
up to half of @entity1 's residents live in slums , about a million in the shacks of @entity61 , the biggest slum in @entity63			1
in these cities within a city children play next to the sewers that run through the streets , whole families often live in a single room and clean water is scarce			0
yet while the slums can be grindingly poor , they are also buzzing with activity			0
many residents of @entity61 work in cottage industries and in the thriving recycling trade , and their biggest threats are the annual monsoon floods and the developers eager to clear the slum in order to exploit the prime real estate it occupies			0
for outsiders , the contrast between rich and poor can be jarring , but @entity85 have learned to live with adversity			0
while the @entity1 terror attacks of november 2008 horrified the world , the killings were tragically familiar to those living in a city where hundreds have been killed by terrorists over the last 15 years and religious and social tensions simmer beneath the surface			1
yet , despite its very visible problems , @entity1 simply will not be denied			0
constantly growing in population and wealth , @entity1 is a world - class city when it comes to culture , commerce and consumption			1
@entity85 are incredibly enterprising and their ability to bounce back from tragedy is testimony to their resourcefulness and resilience			0
@entity110 , director of award - winning movie " @entity113 , " set and filmed in @entity1 , said of the city , " despite all that has happened there recently it is a city moving towards happiness			1
" you have these incredible extremes but it feels like there 's a destiny that binds it all together			0

@entity1 is fearlessly embracing modernity and western consumerism
despite the city 's growing wealth , up to half of its residents live in slums
@entity1 has been the target of *numerous* terrorist attacks in recent years
@entity140 are resilient and the city is " moving towards happiness "
