@entity0 has spent 17 years in a tiny cell in @entity3 of the @entity4 , close to the death chamber			1
every execution is a reminder that his turn will come one day			2
he got that reminder again thursday when @entity11 became the first inmate to be executed in @entity4 since last april			1
that 's when @entity14 died in what was widely seen as a botched lethal injection process			1
" i 've seen it on tv , " says @entity0 , 51 , in a telephone call from death row			1
he says he 's reconciled with his fate , though he has always maintained his innocence			0
he says he has long believed that without mental preparation , things will not go well in his final moments			0
but when he learned that @entity14 's was one of the longest executions in @entity28 history and that he moaned and writhed on the gurney for 43 minutes before dying of a heart attack , a new anxiety set in			1
" i am worried they will botch it again , " he says			0
the bungled execution horrified people around the world , and the state put a moratorium on carrying out the ultimate punishment until it could fully review what happened			1
but @entity42 's decision to go forth thursday with a variation of the same drug formula concerned death penalty lawyers who say the state still risks violating the @entity48 by inflicting cruel and unusual punishment on inmates			1
attorneys for @entity11 , @entity52 and two other @entity42 inmates facing execution appealed to the @entity28 @entity55 on wednesday for stays until the new protocol could be evaluated			1
but the justices voted 5 - 4 to deny the application			0
in her dissent , justice @entity60 wrote that she was " deeply troubled " by the continued use of midazolam , a sedative at the heart of the lethal injection controversy			1
attorney @entity67 , one of the lawyers who filed the suit , says the @entity55 will have to revisit this issue in the near future			0
" the drugs and drug combinations used in executions today vary tremendously across different jurisdictions , " he says			2
" this experimentation has led to the predictable but tragic result of multiple botched executions			1
the court 's guidance on the practices currently employed in lethal injection is urgently needed			1
" @entity42 officials say , however , that they have addressed the concerns that surfaced after @entity14 and put new equipment and protocol in place			1
so , shortly after 7 p.m. ( 8 p.m. et ) , in a renovated death chamber , the lethal cocktail began flowing into the veins of @entity11 , convicted of the first - degree rape and murder of his then - girlfriend 's 11 - month - old daughter			1
he was pronounced dead at 7:28 p.m. @entity52 is scheduled to die next , on january 29			1
@entity42 spent $ 71,000 renovating the chamber and the adjacent witness rooms so that executioners have more space			1
the state also spent $ 34,000 on new equipment , including a $ 12,500 gurney that replaced one from the 1950s and an ultrasound machine to help detect veins			2
but the state did not deem it necessary to change its controversial three - drug formula			1
of particular concern is the use of the sedative midazolam , also used in two other executions that went awry : @entity115 agonized for 26 minutes in @entity116 , and @entity117 gasped more than 600 times and took two hours to die in @entity119			1
witnesses in @entity4 said @entity14 regained consciousness after the sedative was administered			2
they said he grimaced and suffered for many minutes			0
@entity14 's execution was halted after his iv needle dislodged and spewed blood , but he later died			2
a state investigation linked the problem to the iv lines not being inserted correctly			2
this has been a problem in other executions as well			2
" what they have not done is investigate whether their use of midazolam in the @entity14 execution contributed to the fiasco that resulted , " says @entity132 , executive director of the @entity133 , which does not officially take a position but is widely seen as anti-capital punishment			2
@entity42 upped its dosage of midazolam to 500 milligrams , compared with the 100 milligrams @entity14 got			1
but @entity132 says there is no proof that increasing the dosage will avoid problems			0
" they have not shown that this drug will produce the necessary level of unconsciousness to allow the execution to proceed humanely , " he says			2
@entity153 uses the same three - drug cocktail and it , too , executed a convicted murderer thursday after the @entity55 gave the green light			1
@entity157 was declared dead at 8:16 p.m. at the @entity158 in @entity159			0
until 2010 , states employed a fairly standard drug formula to carry out the death penalty that included the anesthetic sodium thiopental			0
but after the sole @entity28 manufacturer stopped making the drug and @entity167 companies refused to sell it for use in executions , states faced drug shortages for the lethal cocktail and searched desperately for alternatives			1
@entity174 , commonly used as a sedative before surgery , was first used in @entity153 in 2011 without any guarantees that the inmate would remain sedated long enough			1
witnesses who watched convicted murderer @entity181 die said that he remained conscious longer than those who were killed with the old formula			2
death penalty opponents say the use of midazolam amounts essentially to experimentation on human beings			0
but four states use the drug in their lethal injections			2
the executions thursday in @entity4 and @entity153 began with midazolam			1
then the inmates were injected with a paralytic agent to prevent the inmate from flailing , followed by potassium chloride , which stopped their hearts			2
@entity0 thinks about what he might feel after he is strapped into the gurney and the drugs begin coursing through his veins			1
he has spent the last few weeks imagining a disastrous end like @entity14 's			0
@entity203 , a @entity204 nun who ministers to the condemned and has spoken with @entity52 , says he is haunted by @entity14 's agony			0
" he 's scared , " she says : that the sedative wo n't do its job , that he will be helpless to stop the pain			2
it 's difficult for many people to feel any sympathy for a man who was convicted in a hire - for - murder scheme that resulted in the 1997 death of @entity218 , owner of a @entity219 in @entity220			0
@entity218 's family appeared at a clemency hearing for @entity52 in october and spoke of the many ways they missed a husband , father and brother			0
they said too often , victims of crime are forgotten in the capital punishment process			0
" i will speak for my brother , " said @entity232			0
" it hurts like hell to have your head bashed in with a baseball bat			0
do not feel sorry for the bastard who took my life			0
" @entity218 's sister , @entity242 , told the clemency board that the death penalty was not revenge , but the law			0
but attorneys for death row inmates say @entity42 's execution protocol remains unconstitutional			1
their appeal to the @entity55 says the state is relying on a " drug that can not reliably produce or maintain a deep , comalike unconsciousness			2
" @entity67 , one of @entity11 's attorneys , says midazolam was not part of the lethal injection protocol approved by the @entity55 in 2008			1
simply increasing the dosage , he says , does not overcome the risk and leaves @entity42 open to inhumane action			1
" @entity42 's current execution protocol creates a substantial risk of severe pain , needless suffering and a lingering death , " @entity67 says			1
@entity1 contacted the @entity265 for comment and was referred to the execution protocol posted on its website			2
@entity0 says he ca n't believe @entity42 resumed the use of a sedative that has been so problematic , one that , ironically , bought him time			1
he might have been dead already -- his initial execution date was set in november -- but the state postponed it because it said it was n't quite prepared with its new procedures			1
for a while , @entity0 got to leave a special holding cell for the final 35 days before execution and return to his old one , located beneath the death chamber			1
he was glad for that			0
in the holding cell , two fluorescent lights glared down on him 24/7			0
his plexiglass - wrapped television set was revoked			2
he was allowed a single book but chose to write letters instead			0
many inmates ask for a @entity287 , he says			0
at @entity288 , he launched a hunger strike			0
that way , he could have some agency over his death , he thought			0
but @entity203 , who is planning to be with him at his execution , persuaded him to eat			2
" i feel especially responsible for @entity0 , " she says			1
" a few days ago i urged him to eat again so he can fight to expose the horrible injustice , not only for himself but for all who go through this torture			0
" @entity52 has exhausted all appeals of his verdict and sentence			0
he was tried twice for @entity218 's killing -- the first conviction was tossed because of incompetent legal representation			0
but a second jury also convicted him			0
prosecutors said @entity0 hired maintenance worker @entity306 to take a baseball bat and bludgeon their boss @entity218 to death because @entity0 thought he would be fired			1
at trial , @entity306 testified that he killed @entity218 at @entity52 's behest and received a life sentence			0
@entity0 was sentenced to death			1
" twice a jury has heard the evidence against @entity0 and twice a jury has convicted him and sentenced him to death for his role in the murder of @entity322 , " says @entity314 , a spokesman for the @entity4 attorney general			1
@entity52 holds steadfast to his innocence			0
he says he is being put to death even though the real killer lied and gets to live			0
" i feel sorry for @entity218 's family , " @entity0 says			1
" but i did not commit a crime			0
" he adds , " at first i was angry at @entity306 , but now i feel sorry for him			0
he 's afraid of how @entity42 will kill him if he owns up to what really happened , just like i am afraid of how they 'll kill me			1
it 's fear making him lie about what happened			0
" these days @entity0 thinks about his late parents -- his mother died just a year ago -- and 14 siblings			2
he thinks about what it would feel like to see green grass and trees again			0
they are things that @entity218 's family wishes their loved one could see now , too .			0
