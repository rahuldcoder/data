@entity1 sen. @entity0 -- not @entity2 -- is the top progressive choice for president in 2016 , according to a new poll			1
in fact , @entity6 does n't even make second place			0
forty two percent of respondents favor @entity10 , and @entity12 independent senator @entity11 also edges out @entity6 with 24 % compared to her 23 % , according to results from the 2016 @entity15 commissioned by progressive grassroots organization @entity16			1
these results come amid a groundswell of activism from the @entity20 's more liberal wing , which has called for a contested 2016 primary and has often questioned @entity6 's financial ties to @entity23			1
" @entity0 won by a large margin because she inspires @entity20 by valiantly fighting for populist progressive policies to address income inequality in the face of @entity23 resistance -- and because she regularly engages with the grassroots base of her party , " said @entity24 , the group 's executive director , in a release of the poll			2
he noted , however , that the poll 's biggest finding is not that support for @entity10 among liberal voters is widespread , but that progressives want to make sure that the @entity20 nomination process is a " contest , not a coronation			1
" vice president @entity43 , rumored to be considering a third presidential bid , was selected by 2 % of those polled			0
@entity6 , a far - and - away frontrunner in most other polls of mainstream @entity20 and @entity48 voters , is widely expected to launch a presidential bid			2
whether @entity10 or @entity11 will throw their hats in the ring is not as clear			1
@entity10 repeatedly told @entity54 's @entity53 in an interview that she has no intention of running for president			2
but as her clout as a progressive firebrand has grown , senate majority leader @entity58 appointed her to his leadership team , a move party leaders hope will bring more left - leaning voters into the fold and increase the party 's chances of winning back @entity69 seats in 2016			0
@entity16 -- founded by former @entity12 governor and former presidential candidate @entity71 -- now boasts one million members , with nearly 165 thousand total votes cast in this poll			0
since the group 's founding in 2004 , members have raised more than $ 32.7 million to support progressive candidates			0
participants , surveyed between nov. 6 and nov. 18 , were permitted to select and rank up to three total candidates they 'd like to see run in 2016 .			0

a new poll of progressives gives sen. @entity0 a double digit lead over @entity2
@entity6 is expected to run in 2016 , but it 's not clear whether @entity10 and @entity11 will
