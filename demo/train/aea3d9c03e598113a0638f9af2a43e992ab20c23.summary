@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's most senior @entity3 has urged the government of @entity5 not to change the state 's laws to allow the victims of sex abuse at the hands of clergy to seek higher compensation than currently available			1
cardinal @entity13 said this would amount to discrimination against the @entity1 @entity16			1
this comes after a tumultuous week in which the victims of church sex abuse heard @entity13 acknowledge the church had covered up the abuse of minors , out of fear the scandal would envelope the faith			1
@entity13 was this week , the final witness in a state government enquiry into the responses to the allegations of child sex abuse by religious and non-government institutions in the state of @entity5			1
the cardinal also apologized for the abuse			1
while denying he had personally covered up offenses committed by priests within the large @entity39 archdiocese over which he presided from 1996 to 2011 , @entity13 said his predecessor , archbishop @entity41 , now deceased , had destroyed documents to protect priests			1
" the primary motivation would have been to respect the reputation of the church			1
there was a fear of scandal , " @entity13 told the enquiry , which is expected to deliver its report to the @entity5 government at the end of september			1
@entity13 also admitted that the cover - ups had allowed pedophile priests to continue to prey on young children			1
'' i would have to say there is significant truth in that , '' @entity13 said , while also admitting the @entity1 church had been slow to understand and deal with the damage , and oftentimes the destruction of the lives of the victims			1
'' @entity66 in the church did not understand just what damage was being done to the victims			1
we understand that better now , '' he said			2
'' if we 'd been gossips , which we were n't , we would have realized earlier just how widespread this business was			0
'' the @entity1 premier , @entity74 , last year called a wide - ranging , nationwide enquiry into child sex abuse , though it is not confined to the @entity16			1
the investigation found that , in @entity5 alone , there have been 600 cases of child sex abuse at the hands of @entity3 clergy since the 1930s			1
" there have been too many revelations of adults who have averted their eyes from this evil , " said @entity74 when she announced the @entity83			1
among the many cases reported by @entity2 when the @entity83 was announced was that of @entity39 sisters @entity92 and @entity93 who were assaulted by their local parish priest , @entity94 , now deceased			0
@entity92 was just five years old when the rapes began			0
@entity93 was younger , her parents believe probably around four			0
@entity94 was convicted of the sexual assault of 12 victims , according to the victims lobby group @entity99			0
the court was told he had offended consistently from 1946 until he was brought before the courts in 1995			0
when @entity92 heard news of his conviction , she was 14 and began self - harming			1
" we saw her with blood pouring out of her wrists taking heroin to dull the pain			0
" the girls ' father , @entity112 told @entity2 last year			2
@entity92 took her own life when she was 26			0
when her sister @entity93 turned 14 , she became cognizant of the sexual abuse she had suffered and told her parents			2
" she was at a friend 's house , " @entity93 said			0
" she was drunk , crossed the road and was hit by car			0
" she has severe brain injuries			0
but she ca n't run her life , " he explained			0
@entity94 was never charged with the sex abuse of the @entity93 sisters			1
@entity93 said he died before charges could be laid			0
he and his wife @entity129 sat at the @entity130 this week to hear @entity13 's evidence			1
" it comes down to a question of restitution of lives , " @entity93 told @entity2			0
" and this does n't just happen with an apology			0
it requires much , much more than that			0
it requires whatever victims need to improve the quality of their lives and there should be no limitations on compensation			0
" the @entity147 , under @entity13 's leadership , capped compensation at a $ 75,000 ( u.s. $ 72,000 ) per victim , along with ongoing counseling and treatment			1
during his evidence to the @entity5 enquiry , @entity13 admitted the compensation cap was low compared to that offered to victims of catholic clergy abuse in the @entity158			1
at the same time , he acknowledged the enormous wealth of the @entity1 church and added it would " pay whatever the law recommends is appropriate compensation			1
" for @entity93 , this reflects poorly on the @entity1 church			1
" he was basically saying the church will change if the government tells it to , " he said			2
" a lot of what 's been done is driven by the business side of the church and the @entity16 is a large business			2
" nor does @entity13 's admission that the church had covered up the abuse bring solace or closure			1
" no , there is no closure , " he told @entity2			0
" we knew there 'd been a cover - up			2
all of @entity1 knew that			1
we had a feeling of disappointment because we expected more , but all that happened was he said the things we already knew			0
" and @entity93 fears the church 's response to child sex abuse is still driven by fear of reputational damage			1
" i think the avoidance of scandal is still what drives it along with the minimization of the financial effect , " he said			0
he says the @entity1 @entity16 is a fractured organization able to deflect responsibility to individual dioceses and orders			1
the @entity1 church is comprised of 33 diocese , 7 archdiocese and 175 religious orders			1
" it would be useful if there was some reform of the church to the point that there is someone or somebody responsible for all branches of the church , " he said			2
" it is almost a state of anarchy in the church ; no one is responsible for anything other than in their sector			2
we have the @entity1 @entity225 , which is close and they can agree to common forms of process			1
but there is very much a reliance on individual orders and diocese doing the right thing , " said @entity93			0
nor , says @entity93 , has the church been pro-active is investigating those priests against whom allegations have been made , and sometimes proven			1
" the church could have at least started to investigate backwards from the claims they received			2
they only ever reacted to a claim			0
the church has never proactively looked at what the ( reported ) priests were doing and what access the pedophile priests had to kids			2
every one of the victims had gone to the church for help			2
none were the church going out to look for them			2
" in his evidence to the enquiry , @entity13 said the church 's organizational structure was such that , indeed , no single individual could be held accountable			1
" i 'm not the @entity3 prime minister of australia			1
i am not the general manager @entity1			1
a very interesting example of a flat organization , " he said			0
he admitted that , in some cases , the @entity16 had placed priests above the law , but he denied the church had ignored claims brought before it , despite evidence that concerns about @entity94 had been raised as far back as 1946			2
" i think many persons in the leadership of the @entity16 , i do n't think they knew what a horrendous widespread [ issue ] we were sitting on , " he said			0
for the @entity278 , @entity13 's apology and admissions are too little , too late			1
his surviving daughter @entity93 remains highly dependent on care to live			0
" @entity93 is a shell of what she should be " @entity93 said			0
" she has 24 - hour care and always needs someone looking after her			2
she ca n't remember anything			0
she has no idea what she is doing in ten minutes time			0
" but recently , the family has had good news			0
@entity93 is engaged to be married and recently has begun the slow process of learning how to walk again , 15 years after the accident that followed her realization of the abuse she suffered			2
" we are incredibly pleased and fortunate that through the care teams she has had , she has met someone and is engaged			0
but it 's not like it should have been , " @entity93 said			0
however , the damage to @entity93 's life and that of her parents , will linger			0
" the question of children has been a major one because it is not fair on the child , " said her father			2
" the child would be cared for by her carer			2
but it is her decision			0
