-- @entity2 , the foul - mouthed , alcohol - swilling , cutting , irreverent and occasionally naked host of @entity1 's hit talk show " @entity8 , " is taking her act and moving it to @entity7			1
later this year and in 2015 , she 'll create some comedy and documentary specials and then in 2016 premiere another talk show			2
@entity2 to host @entity7 talk show the last episode of " @entity8 " will air on tuesday night			1
in her seven - year run , @entity2 has made " lately " the go - to place for fans wanting something a little tarter with their talk - show entertainment			1
let @entity20 have the " nice " aura ; @entity2 is just as soon exasperated with her show , her staff and even her guests as she is tickled			1
at this point , who knows what she 'll bring to her @entity7 program , which -- given the on - demand nature of the service -- will almost certainly have a different format			1
nevertheless , there 's plenty about " @entity8 " we hope carries over to @entity2 's next talk - show chapter			1
here are seven things we 'll miss in the meantime : 1			0
she regularly bit the hand that presented her			0
@entity2 laughed and made fun of the same things the rest of us joke about , even when those things -- the @entity47 , @entity48 -- happened to share a network with her			1
she did n't care , which was classic @entity8			2
of course , @entity1 probably did n't mind either , because any publicity is good publicity -- even mockery of @entity48 's stature			0
she was willing to make fun of herself , too			0
@entity2 has been notably open about her louche , if exaggerated , private life			2
and she encourages needles from guests as well as the comedians who join her for the roundtable to discuss the news			0
it 's hard to imagine @entity67 -- or even @entity68 -- being willing to engage in argumentative sketches with the likes of @entity71 and @entity72 while standing naked in a shower			1
( judging from the fuzzed - out naughty bits , there 's a minimum of special effects involved			2
incidentally , nice abs , @entity79			0
) seems like @entity2 would be a natural to mount a revival of " @entity81			2
on other talk shows , the former " friends " star is like most other celebrities : sticking to the script ( or the blue cards ) and answering only what was discussed backstage with some assistant producer			0
but on " @entity8 , " she lets down her hair ( so to speak ) , probably because @entity2 is a friend outside of the studio			1
she 's even gotten choked up ! 5			0
well , hello there , guest			0
one of @entity2 's long - running jokes is that she sleeps with almost all her guests , which in the case of @entity100 probably actually happened			1
but she was happy to flirt with almost everybody , men and women alike			0
international incidents ! it was n't enough that @entity2 insulted @entity107 during the @entity108 this year			2
that was on her @entity111 account , which ( presumably ) wo n't be going anywhere			0
but how many other talk show hosts would offend a whole country ? chances are that @entity117 is n't going to mind @entity2 's departure from @entity1			1
what about @entity120 ? @entity8 , aka @entity120 , has been @entity2 's diminutive right hand for the run of the show			1
no word on whether he 'll be joining her at @entity7 -- @entity126 says he is n't -- but in the meantime , fans will have to be satisfied with his recommendations on serving tacos , using @entity131 and healthy living			2
