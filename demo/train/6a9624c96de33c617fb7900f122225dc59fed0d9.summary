@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the old town of @entity1 's capital @entity0 , something subtle and unexpected is happening			1
in the wake of the economic crisis , the historic center -- an attractive old town ringed by vast 16th century @entity11 walls -- is gradually coming back to life with new cafes , shops , and art galleries emerging from the labyrinthine streets			1
@entity19 , at the heart of town , has been a symbol for the island 's division since 1974 , when , in july of that year , a @entity24 military junta backed a coup d'etat in @entity1			1
in response @entity26 launched military intervention and by august it had landed thousands of troops and successfully partitioned the island			2
around 180,000 @entity31 were forced south and some 50,000 @entity32 moved into vacant properties in the northern @entity26 occupied zone			2
since 2008 , @entity19 has reopened with a checkpoint that can now be crossed			2
but between the ubiquitous @entity40 and @entity41 outlets , and the local restaurants selling frozen yoghurt , coffee , and souvlaki by the pita - load , @entity38 soldiers still patrol			1
gradually however , through the frustrations of separation and the strain of the economic crisis , a new generation of poets , directors and entrepreneurs are reclaiming the area			1
band aid the band @entity57 have been playing in and around @entity19 for several years			2
many of their songs have a distinctly political edge			2
the band 's lead singer , @entity62 , says that in his view music and art can help to heal old wounds : " we strongly believe that art and music can reconcile and reunite people ... especially in parts of the world where problems are between neighboring countries			2
for instance , here in @entity1 , the two communities share the same culture , and people used to live happily together listening to the same songs -- in many cases sung in both @entity24 and @entity26			1
this should be used as an example to bring people of the communities together			2
" the @entity86 -- the buffer zone between the north and south @entity1 -- stretches almost across the length of the country ( interrupted by the @entity91 of @entity92 ) , but nowhere is it more visible than in @entity0			1
" the @entity86 gives the city a strange energy ... in a good way , " says @entity94 , a writer who lives in city			1
" there is a silence here ; an absence			2
a feeling of the past with the @entity38 in the middle			1
it is very edgy and it gives the city a very interesting charm			1
you need to get over yourself to get over the line			2
" cafe culture even though the checkpoints are now open , barricades still snake through the middle of town			0
on the corner of one inauspicious street , is the popular @entity119 , which owner @entity120 has managed since before the checkpoints opened up			0
the cafe attracts all kinds of people , and welcomes anyone from either side of town			0
" the vibe of the place is what i believe attracts ( my customers ) , " @entity120 says			0
" @entity119 is like no other place			0
it is on the @entity86 , sitting on the ' @entity133			1
' it carries the energy and history of the city			1
it is untouched and one can see how the time has stopped			0
" retail therapy alongside the arts scene are the shops , many of which celebrate their location with an unmistakable irony			0
a kebab shop called @entity148 2 sits right by a street blockade ; a little further down the road you can buy lingerie from @entity153			0
on @entity154 runs a shop called the @entity156 -- a high end men 's fashion boutique and art gallery space			0
the shop has no mirrors , but asks its customers go outside and down the street to look at themselves in the mirrors inside the nearby @entity38 guard station			1
" i find it necessary to expose my clients to this reality , " @entity154 says			0
" to make them see their reflection among the ruins , ( and ) get them to think about where it is they are standing , at a very particular level of history			0
" as there is a high turnover of guards , @entity154 regularly has to explain what he is doing : " officially the access to the guard station 103 is not permitted to anyone			0
in addition , the guards often change so i do not know several of them and anyway i always have to ask permission , explaining the nature of my request ... i do not know why they let me enter , " he says			0
many younger people in @entity0 see hope for the city and believe that reconciliation , while difficult , is certainly possible			1
@entity62 believes that opening up the crossings and allowing the two communities to get to know one another has been key to the city 's healing			1
" for the first time in our lives ( especially for us who were born after 1974 ) we came to have first - hand experiences with the so - called ' other ' and create friendships , " he says			1
" both the propaganda that spread amongst people all these years in both sides and the fact that we had no direct contact with this ' other ' , helped towards demonizing it			0
but now , people who manage to get rid of these prejudices are able to construct relationships and have built trust , so the future could be optimistic			0
" @entity2 @entity219 series often carry sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile			0
however , @entity2 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

the @entity38 - patrolled @entity86 divides @entity1
artists , poets and musicians are returning to the divided @entity1 capital , @entity0
new cafes and galleries are bringing life to the city , and with it hope of reconciliation
