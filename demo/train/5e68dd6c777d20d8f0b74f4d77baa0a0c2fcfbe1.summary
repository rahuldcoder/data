-- with a rev of his @entity4 's engine and a smile , @entity1 plays leader of the pack once a year on his annual fund - raiser , @entity9			1
on a sunday afternoon each fall for the last eight years , @entity1 has been at the head of the line as motorcycle enthusiasts follow him on an hour - long ride from the @entity4 dealership in @entity15 , @entity16 , to downtown @entity18 's @entity17			1
the day ends with a star - studded concert , with some of the biggest names in country music joining @entity22 on his mission			1
over the last eight years @entity1 , his famous friends and their fans have raised over $ 2 million for the @entity27 at @entity28			1
" the idea for this started , i guess , not long after i went out on the road			0
we were just trying to figure out a way to give back to the @entity18 community , do something here			0
( we ) get so many offers to do different types of events to give back , we kind of wanted to make our own so we could really focus on one particular thing , " @entity1 said			2
" we wanted to do something here in @entity18 , so we chose the @entity28 children 's hospital and @entity43 and kind of focused our efforts towards that			1
from the very beginning we 've made money , and i 've been able to bring a big check over to the hospital every year			2
i felt really good about that			0
" @entity1 also credits the advice of a music icon in helping him focus his charitable efforts			1
" i sat next to @entity55 one time and heard about all his exploits and all the stuff he does with his organization one , " he said			0
@entity1 said he was overwhelmed at how much @entity55 's anti-poverty group was accomplishing , " but something he said , and i tell other people too , is to just concentrate on what 's right in front of you			1
it could be a smallest thing in the world , just taking , helping out one person			0
you 're making a difference in changing somebody 's life , so just taking something you can tackle and get behind			0
" while his primary focus was to give back in his own backyard , @entity1 took his show on the road and held rides in several other cities including @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , and @entity85 to benefit the children 's hospitals in those towns			1
" i really like the idea of that because so many towns and cities across this country have given me so much , have given me a life , it 's nice to be able to go in and give back , " @entity1 said			1
@entity1 brought the event back to @entity18 a few years ago and said it 's been pretty easy to get his famous pals to contribute their time on a sunday afternoon they 'd typically have off			1
big stars like @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 bring the fans in , and as a result the fund - raising is more and more profitable every year			1
if you ask him about all the star - powered help he gets , @entity1 just chalks it up to people helping each other out			1
but that 's not entirely it , according to the event 's emcee @entity114 , host of @entity117 's " @entity116			0
" " i think it 's as simple as his energy and his genuineness			0
there 's just something about @entity124 that you want to root for , and the whole town feels that			0
he 's loved by everybody , both as an artist and as a person			0
so it 's like he gets behind a cause , you want to help him out with it			0
and it 's his ability to step out on the edge and say , ' all right , nobody else is doing this ? let 's do it			0
let 's get it done ! ' and we all fall in line , " @entity114 said			0
this year @entity1 led 2,000 riders down the back roads of middle @entity16 , including a few famous faces			2
even the fictitious mayor of @entity18 -- at least , he plays the mayor on @entity151 's " @entity18 " -- @entity152 was along for the ride			2
" i 'm here to support the ride that 's supporting @entity27 , " @entity152 said			2
" one of the things i love about the city of @entity18 -- it 's an incredibly charitable place			2
there 's constantly events going on , people are very supportive			0
it 's constant that people are out there trying to make a difference , and this is one of those events where they 're making a difference in the lives of kids through the children 's hospital at @entity28 , " said close			1
@entity1 , who did n't have children when he started this fund - raiser , now is the father of three and is even more aware of the importance of his cause			1
" you 're always just praying to have a healthy kid , that 's the most important thing , and knock on wood , we have			0
but you never know when you could be in someone else 's shoes and need the assistance of the great medical staff and team , like at @entity186			0
so ( the ride is ) something i definitely look forward to every year and definitely feel really honored to just to kind of be the face of the whole deal , " @entity1 said			1
@entity9 this year raised over $ 300 thousand -- a new record .			2
