@entity9 , @entity10 -- " so when i was driving down this hilly , windy road in @entity2 , i really went to a dark place and thought , ' you know , i could turn right [ over the side of the canyon ] and no one would know			2
it would look like an accident , ' " remembers @entity12 , the chief correspondent for " @entity13 " and a former @entity11 anchor			1
" my wife would get $ 3 million of insurance			2
it would solve all of our problems			0
of course the big problem would n't be solved because i would be dead			0
" ironically , after 2Â½ years without a full - time job , the veteran newsman had finally found work with " @entity13 , " but an upside - down mortgage and a mountain of debt fueled by subprime loans had brought him to a financial meltdown			1
it had him literally staring into the abyss of suicide			2
" whether your home is worth $ 150,000 or $ 5 million , " he writes , " the real prospect of losing everything you have worked your entire life to achieve is devastating and utterly demoralizing			0
" like @entity42 in the movie " it 's a @entity41 , " it had occurred to him that financially , he was worth more dead than alive			1
but when he thought about his family , he pulled back from the precipice and got to thinking , " what if i had one day left , how would i view life ? what 's important ? what would i value ? how do i look at friendship and love and gratitude and laughter and music and forgiveness and adventure ? and none of those things had anything to do with money			1
money was the root of my desperation			0
" @entity12 did n't seek professional help			1
writing was his therapy , he says , so with his wife 's encouragement , he wrote about the experience and the life - changing insights it gave him			1
but as he got further into it , it dawned on him : " wow			0
i just might have a book here			0
" the final result is " @entity75 , " which @entity12 calls an " inspirational memoir			1
" " in the 20 or so chapters , if you can find one or two or three that you can relate to , then i feel wonderful , because the idea is that you can see yourself through my story			0
i 'm telling you what my choices were and what i choose to feel is important and then i ask you a question at the end of many chapters			0
who would you apologize to if this were your last day ? who would you forgive ? those two things there are really powerful and heavy statements and questions and it 's difficult to forgive somebody who 's wronged you			1
" @entity12 deals with the issue of forgiveness in the chapter on his troubled relationship with his biological father , " @entity103 " star @entity102 , who legally renounced his parental rights when @entity12 was 13			1
@entity12 writes candidly about the feelings of abandonment it caused and his quest to forgive his dad			1
" if you 're not completely honest in a book like this , then the book is devalued considerably			0
i 've put everything out there			0
" @entity12 says he and his family are still hanging on and have n't lost their home yet , but moving " is not as big a deal to me anymore			1
" " if you look at every day as if it 's your last , and treat every day as if it 's your last , you can kind of reset your clock every day			1
' i 've got 24 hours left , how do i proceed ? what do i approach first ? ' and what 's good about that mindset is the little things do n't bother you as much			2
there 's certain things we just ca n't control			2
you 're not going to read this book and go , ' everything will be great			0
' this is not ' @entity136			0
' " " @entity136 " is a self - help book that talks about using positive visualization to attract the things in life you want			0
" ' @entity136 ' really focused on material things , " @entity12 said			1
" my book really focuses on the nonmaterial things , the things you 're ultimately remembered for and that you want to be remembered for , and that make every day really meaningful			2
" how would @entity12 like to be remembered ? " as a good dad , husband , son , brother and friend			2
maybe as a decent musician , too			0
i hope i am regarded as someone who touched a few lives in my time here			1
what more could i ask for ? "			0
