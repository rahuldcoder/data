-- @entity1 , the blog powerhouse built by @entity2 , has been hacked			2
after bringing the company 's websites to a standstill sunday , one or more hackers operating under the name @entity5 released a 500 mb file apparently containing @entity1 's source code , commenter and staff passwords , and internal conversations between the company 's employees			1
the email addresses and passwords of hundreds of thousands of @entity1 users have been compromised , the hackers said			1
it 's the worst security breach in @entity22 - based @entity1 's eight - year history , and a wake - up call to all web publishers			1
" we 're deeply embarrassed by this breach , " @entity25 said in a blog post sunday afternoon			0
the attack included @entity1 's eponymous flagship property , as well as gadget site @entity31 and the culture site @entity34			1
the successful @entity1 hack followed a week of escalating attacks in the wake of @entity39 's continued release of @entity41 documents and counter-attacks by hackers associated with group known as @entity45 , which has staged a campaign called @entity47			1
over the last year , @entity1 has been covering , with its trademark disdain , the antics of the @entity51 message board , leading @entity51 users to attack the site with denial - of - service attacks in july			2
that 's the same tactic being used against @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 for those companies ' decisions to cut - off the ability to donate to @entity39			0
but the latest attack is much more serious than a typical denial - of - service attack			0
@entity1 's attackers managed to infiltrate the company 's content management system ( @entity67 ) , user database , and internal communications system			1
the hackers then published a raw file containing that information			0
@entity5 took pains to say , in the uploaded file , that they were not @entity51 , even as they gave a shout - out to it , along with @entity45			2
4chan can only be described as one of the most obnoxious ( and sometimes hilarious ) corners of the net , but it 's not a place where the most sophisticated hackers generally congregate			0
still , @entity5 's choice of targets and their foul language puts them firmly in the net 's " griefer " culture			0
a @entity92 file containing thousands of @entity1 user ids , passwords and email addresses was easily available sunday night			1
some of the email addresses and passwords in the file appear to correspond to several prominent current and former @entity1 employees			1
the source code to @entity1 's website was also released , according to the hackers , as were internal chat communications among @entity1 employees			1
@entity1 seems to have regained control of their servers , and are advising readers to change their passwords			2
however , the real threat is for those readers who use the same password at @entity1 that they do for other online services , since the hackers and others are at work breaking the outdated encryption @entity1 used to store the passwords			2
quite a few have already been broken			0
wired : vigilantes take offensive in @entity39 censorship battle anyone who has set up up an account to comment on @entity1 is advised to change their passwords as soon as possible			2
@entity5 made clear its disdain for @entity1 in the leaked file			0
" f * * * you gawker , hows this for ' script kids ? ' " the hacker wrote			0
" your empire has been compromised , your servers , your database 's , online accounts and source code have all be ripped to shreds ! you wanted attention , well guess what , you 've got it now ! " the file , which also includes information about @entity1 's upcoming re-design , was being shared by dozens of people via file - sharing protocol bittorrent sunday night the hacker wrapped up the data dump with the following message			1
" you would think a site that likes to mock people , such as gawker , would have better security and actually have a clue what they are doing			0
but as we 've proven , those who think they are beyond our reach are n't as safe as they would like to think ! " subscribe to @entity0 for less than $ 1 an issue and get a free gift ! click here ! copyright 2011 @entity167 .			0
