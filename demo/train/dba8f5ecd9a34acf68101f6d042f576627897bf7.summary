-- @entity2 's 1997 album " @entity3 " holds a number of hits , including the smash singles " honey " and " my all			1
" but it 's also the album on which @entity2 tucked an introspective and revealing song called " close my eyes			1
" the powerhouse vocalist was honored by @entity14 on september 7 for her songwriting , and she told @entity0 that the compositions she holds closest typically are n't the songs that became chart - toppers			1
instead , her favorites are often lesser - known cuts from more obscure records			0
she cites " @entity28 " from the 1995 album " @entity26 " as well as " looking in " and " @entity27 " from the same album as some of her favorites			2
of big no. 1 hits such as " @entity32 " " we belong together " and " hero , " @entity2 said : " i still love those songs , " but added , " i love the obscure songs because they 're very close to my heart			1
especially a song called , ' @entity37 ' -- that 's like my life story			2
" the down - tempo , piano - backed track paints a picture of a woman with a past -- " i was a wayward child , with the weight of the world that i held deep inside , " @entity2 sings			1
" life was a winding road , and i learned many things little ones should n't know			0
" but , like her new single " @entity52 , " the chorus speaks of courage in the face of adversity : " but i closed my eyes , steadied my feet on the ground , raised my head to the sky			1
and though times rolled by , still i feel like a child as i look at the moon			0
... maybe i grew up a little too soon			0
" while @entity2 did n't go into detail about the experiences that inspired that song , she did describe what led to the creation of " triumphant			1
" @entity2 said her husband , @entity70 , was going through some health problems around the same time her friend @entity72 died			1
" there was just so much going on , " she said			0
" it was such an awful time			0
... i do n't even know how to express what was happening , but i had to express it through music in terms of going the opposite way , almost to encourage myself			0
" and by encouraging herself , she hoped to encourage others			0
" i say , ' stay triumphant			2
' that is what i wanted people to hear -- i wanted people who did n't have the strength			0
... that 's why i 'm glad that i put this record out , because that 's what it meant to me			2
and i was also singing what i would want to sing in an encouraging way to my kids			0
" @entity2 's twins with @entity70 , @entity97 and @entity98 , celebrated their first birthday in april			1
there 's a good chance " triumphant " will have the impact @entity2 's hoping for , as she 's heard from fans how her songs have changed their lives			1
" this ( @entity108 ) award is so amazing because ... this is really about songwriting and there have been many times that people have told me throughout my career that : ' this song has changed my life , ' ' this song helped me get through the death of a family member , ' " @entity2 said			2
" and as the writer of that song ... there 's no greater feeling than that			0
" @entity2 , @entity70 renew vows in @entity124			2
