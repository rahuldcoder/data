what do you need to map a billion stars ? a billion - pixel camera certainly helps			2
scientists hope to glean more clues about the origin and evolution of the universe , and in particular our own galaxy , after a camera of this incredible scale -- fitted to the @entity14 space telescope -- was launched thursday			1
@entity14 , which lifted off from @entity15 , has been tasked with mapping the @entity16 in greater detail than ever before			1
designed and built by @entity19 for the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , the makers say the telescope is so sensitive that it could measure a person 's thumbnail from the @entity24 , or to put it another way , detect the width of a human hair from 1,000km ( 620 miles ) away			1
the mission 's aim is to build a three - dimensional picture of our galaxy , measuring precise distances to a billion stars			2
even this is a small fraction of the @entity16 , as astronomers believe there are at least 100 billion stars in our galaxy			2
tens of billions like @entity42 , study says @entity19 says @entity14 is also expected to log a million quasars beyond the @entity16 , and a quarter of a million objects in our own solar system , including comets and asteroids			1
" it can do it with incredible accuracy			0
it 's the biggest camera ever put into space , " said @entity51 , head of science and exploration at @entity19			0
he said the spacecraft cost 400 million euros ( $ 549 million ) to build , but the total cost of the mission would come to 740 million euros ( $ 1.02 billion ) when the expense of the launch and running the mission for its projected five - year lifetime are included			0
if successful , @entity14 will add to the knowledge gained from @entity65 's @entity64 , which is still in operation , and @entity20 's @entity68 satellite , which gathered data until 1993			1

" @entity14 is an amazingly ambitious mission , " he said			2
" until now astronomers have relied on very indirect methods to gauge the distance to all but the nearest stars , meaning that the foundation on which we build a map of the universe is surprisingly weak			0
" building on the work of the pioneering @entity68 satellite that mapped the stellar neighbourhood in the 1990s , @entity14 will be used to carry out work analogous to the cartographers who surveyed the @entity42 in the 19th and 20th centuries , building up the first accurate charts of the cosmos and helping us better understand the structure , history and fate of the galaxy we live in			1
" one of @entity14 's objectives is to help in the hunt for exoplanets -- new worlds beyond our own solar system			1
@entity65 's @entity108 mission has so far confirmed the existence of 167 exoplanets with hundreds more being investigated , but @entity51 anticipates @entity14 will likely discover thousands of new planets , while further missions will be able to uncover more detail about them			1
in a recent interview with @entity121 , @entity115 , ceo of @entity116 -- the company planning to take tourists into space -- said he thought that within a lifetime it would be possible to detect seasons on far - off worlds			0
he may have not have too long to wait , as @entity19 is already working on design concepts to examine exoplanet atmospheres -- which may provide signs of seasonal variations			0
" we are designing missions that could probably do that very thing -- it 's not science fiction , " said @entity51			0
