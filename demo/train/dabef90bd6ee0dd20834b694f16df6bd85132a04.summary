-- a front - row seat to potentially witness history wednesday night at @entity3 in @entity4 wo n't come cheap -- and neither will the tickets for standing - room - only			2
the last time the @entity8 won a @entity9 at home , the team featured a 23 - year - old ace pitcher named @entity12 , who won two games en route to a 4 - 2 series victory over the @entity16			2
that was 1918 , the year in @entity19 lore when the @entity8 supposedly fell under a curse that kept them from ever again winning the @entity9			0
though the @entity22 was finally vanquished with @entity4 's @entity9 title in 2004 -- and then for good measure in 2007 -- those victories came on the road , not at their @entity3 home			1
so now , with only one more win to go , some fans are shelling out big bucks just for the chance to witness what they hope will be one final @entity3 exorcism			0
the average price for a game 6 ticket on online broker @entity37 was $ 2,189 on tuesday evening , while the cheapest available on @entity38 was a standing - room - only ticket on the right field roof box for $ 983.75			1
one @entity41 posting offering " cheap " game 6 tickets ( in all caps , apparently to hammer home the bargain ) led to a broker selling standing - room - only for $ 774			1
but the person who shelled out the most for @entity49 's pastime on @entity38 did n't even come from @entity49 : a fan from @entity51 paid a whopping $ 12,092 for a seat near home plate , according to @entity38 spokeswoman @entity54			1
that 's pretty staggering , considering the @entity8 paid @entity12 less -- around $ 7,000 -- for the entire 1918 season , according to @entity57			0
the @entity8 lead the @entity58 3 - 2 in in the best - of - seven series			0
if a seventh game is necessary , it would also be played at @entity3 , so either way , a team donning red will be celebrating in @entity4 this week .			0

@entity66 buyer pays more than $ *12k* for seat near home plate at @entity3
@entity8 hope to banish the @entity22 by winning series at home
average price for a game 6 ticket on one online broker is $ 2,189 on tuesday
