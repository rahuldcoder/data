-- today , @entity1 will celebrate its annual @entity2 , and all players and umpires will wear jerseys with the number 42 , which @entity7 , the first @entity9 - @entity8 player in the @entity1 , made famous			1
do n't be surprised if the execs at @entity11 join in on the fun			0
the studio did have a grand slam weekend , after all			1
@entity11 ' new baseball drama 42 topped the box office with $ 27.3 million — far ahead of recent baseball titles like @entity18 ( $ 19.5 million debut ) and @entity20 ( $ 12.2 million )			1
in fact , 42 scored the best ever debut for a baseball film , surpassing the @entity25 ' $ 19.7 million bow			1
42 also became the latest release to earn a rare " a + " cinemascore grade , signifying exemplary word - of - mouth among ticket - buyers			2
former " @entity31 " releases include the help , tangled , @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity35			0
42 , which was produced by @entity37 for $ 40 million , stars newcomer @entity38 as @entity7 , as well as @entity39 as @entity1 exec @entity40			1
the film played exceedingly well with older moviegoers ( 59 percent of audience members were above the age of 35 ) and @entity9 - @entity8 crowds ( all ten of 42 ′ s top theaters were in urban markets )			1
according to @entity11 , a surprisingly high 52 percent of the opening weekend crowd was female			2
if history is any indication , 42 will keep running around the bases for a long time to come			2
like fellow " @entity31 " films the help and @entity33 , which also deal with racial issues , 42 should earn a terrific multiplier and finish well above $ 100 million			2
@entity11 says it plans on expanding the film from its already - wide 3,002 theater count next weekend			1
@entity0 : ' 42 ' movie review in second place , @entity59 hit more of a bunt than a home run during its opening frame			1
the spoof sequel nabbed an unremarkable $ 15.2 million over the friday - to - sunday period from 3,402 theaters , a low - point for the 13 - year - old franchise			0
part of the reason for @entity59 's sub-par performance may have to do with the fact that it arrived in theaters a full seven years after @entity73 , which earned $ 40.2 million in its opening weekend in 2006			1
that 's quite a long break for a youth - targeting franchise like @entity76			0
the film stars @entity79 's @entity78 , as well as tabloid - magnets @entity80 and @entity82 in supporting roles			2
( hey , at least this did better than @entity80 's last starring effort ! ) those casting stunts were n't enough to drum up interest in the wretchedly - reviewed sequel , though			0
@entity59 , which @entity90 / @entity89 spent $ 20 million to produce , drew less interest than similar horror spoof @entity92 , which scared up an $ 18.1 million opening in january — against a $ 1.5 million budget no less ! audiences issued @entity59 a " c - " cinemascore grade			1
@entity98 's hit animated family film @entity100 dropped by a slightly larger - than - expected 36 percent in its fourth weekend to $ 13.2 million			1
the $ 135 million caveman comedy has now earned $ 142.5 million domestically , and may finish its run with about $ 180 million			0
overseas , @entity100 has earned an additional $ 207 million , making it a big winner for @entity104			0
@entity0 : ' @entity59 ' review @entity106 : @entity107 dipped 48 percent to $ 10.8 million this weekend , bringing its total to $ 102.4 million after three weekends			1
while the film is running behind its predecessor domestically and wo n't match @entity106 : the rise of @entity115 's $ 150.2 million total , it 's making up ground overseas , where it has earned $ 168.3 million — ahead of @entity115 's $ 152.3 million international finish			2
@entity118 , @entity119 , and @entity120 spent $ 130 million on the sequel			0
rounding out the @entity122 was last weekend 's champ , @entity124 , which plummeted 63 percent to $ 9.5 million			2
due to @entity124 's built - in cult audience , much of which came to the theater on opening day , a large drop was expected			0
after ten days , the $ 17 million production from @entity132 's @entity131 , @entity133 , and @entity134 , has earned $ 41.5 million and may finish with about $ 55 million overall			0
42 -- $ 27.3 million 2			2
@entity59 -- $ 15.2 million 3			1
the @entity100 -- $ 13.2 million 4			0
@entity106 : retaliation -- $ 10.8 million 5			0
@entity124 -- $ 9.5 million in limited release , the @entity138 / @entity137 drama @entity136 successfully expanded into 514 theaters , where it grossed $ 4.1 million , good for a strong $ 7,937 location average			0
@entity143 's latest , trance , was n't as fortunate			0
the film moved from four to 438 theaters this weekend , but could only manage a $ 925,000 frame , yielding a weak $ 2,112 average			1
expect the former film to continue its expansion , while the latter may have trouble convincing tehater owners to take it on board			0
internationally , the @entity157 thriller @entity155 had a terrific debut with $ 61.1 million from 52 territories , 48 of which it won			1
@entity155 's strongest markets included @entity162 ( $ 8.6 million ) , the @entity163 and @entity164 ( $ 7.9 million ) , and @entity165 ( $ 3.9 million )			1
the @entity167 sci - fi adventure opened in the same range as @entity169 , which conjured a $ 69.9 million international bow and has now grossed $ 251.6 million overseas			0
the film opens stateside next weekend			1
