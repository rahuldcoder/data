you 've probably heard this one before : little guy gets too close to a trademark held by a big company			2
big company threatens legal action			2
but have you heard the one where the small business owner responds to a cease and desist order from @entity10 with a satirical letter and a check for $ 6 ? at issue : a craft beer called " @entity15			1
" but we 're getting ahead of ourselves			0
let 's start at the beginning			0
@entity19 owns the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22			1
he has for two and a half years			0
the place is n't a fancy gastro pub , in fact , it does n't even have a kitchen			0
it does one thing and does it well : serve craft beer seven days a week , starting at 4 p.m. a beer is born last january , @entity19 mixed two of his creations together : a vanilla cr√®me and a chocolate coffee ale			1
the result , according to a customer , tasted a whole lot like a certain blended coffee ice beverage served at the more than 5,500 @entity10 locations worldwide			1
the customer wrote about the creation on a beer website , @entity43 , and called it a " @entity15 " -- one letter off from the @entity10 trademarked name			1
cease and desist last week , @entity19 received a letter from @entity10 ' lawyers , asking him to stop using the name			1
" the @entity52 mark only differs from @entity10 's @entity54 mark by one letter , " the letter said , " and is phonetically identical			1
" the bar 's use of the name would cause " confusion " among buyers , it added			0
the message was clear : you violated our trademark			0
but in the black and white legalese , @entity19 saw an opportunity			2
" this huge law firm sends me this letter , " @entity19 told @entity68 on monday night			1
" how many hours did that lawyer have to spend in sending that out ? " @entity19 says he reckons that @entity10 spent more in law firm billable hours than he made in the entire month of december			1
in other words , @entity19 felt he had to respond			2
' we 're poor spelers ' addressing his response to the lawyer and " mr. @entity78 , " he referred to the offending beverage and trademark as " @entity82 " so as to fend off further litigation risk			0
" it has recently come to the @entity20 and @entity86 attention that there were 3 check ins to the beer with a very similar name to the " @entity82 "			2
unfortunately it was only similar to the @entity82 because we meant to call it the same thing			0
lucky for us , we 're poor spelers			0
" " we just feel awful about calling a beer the @entity96 , " the letter went on			0
" we are bad people			0
" and while @entity19 wrote that he would stop calling the beer " @entity82 , " he also wanted to reassure mr. @entity78 that he and his customers meant no harm			1
" i guess that with there being a @entity10 on every corner of every block in every city that some people may think they could get a @entity10 at a local bar , " he wrote			2
" so that was our mistake			0
" check in the mail @entity19 said he wanted to make amends			1
so , in an effort to " remain in good standings , " he included a check for the " full amount of profit gained " from sales of the offending brew			0
total number of beers sold : three			0
the check to @entity10 : $ 6			1
people love stories about little guys standing up to corporations with big pockets			0
and soon , @entity19 's story was splashed all over mainstream media			2
" even someone very inebriated should not find coffee and beer to be confusingly similar , " wrote @entity129 on the bar 's facebook page			2
added @entity135 : " i think you should name your next beer six @entity78 ! " and @entity138 said he 'd fly from @entity139 , @entity140 , just to order the beer			0
" and i do n't like stouts ! ! " request was ' respectful ' @entity144 , a manager for @entity10 communication , told @entity68 the request her company sent to @entity19 was " respectful			1
" " just like many businesses , trademark law requires all companies , including @entity10 , to consistently protect its brand , " she said via e-mail			2
" we always prefer to resolve trademark disputes informally and amicably whenever possible , and we appreciate @entity20 and @entity154 respecting our request to avoid confusion among customers			0
" @entity144 told @entity68 she had n't heard about @entity19 's check			1
she said @entity10 would n't be cashing it			1
the experience prompted @entity19 to stop producing another beer , he said tongue planted firmly in cheek : the " @entity165 - @entity164			1

the beer is vanilla creme and chocolate coffee ale
a customer calls it *frappicino*
@entity19 sends @entity10 $ 6 to " make amends "
the company says it wo n't cash the check
