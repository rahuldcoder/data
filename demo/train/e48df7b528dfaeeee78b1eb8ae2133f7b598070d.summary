president @entity0 appeared to have his most promising window yet in the coming months to keep his promise to close the military - run prison at @entity4			1
then he made the sgt. @entity6 swap			1
the trade of five @entity9 members at @entity4 to free @entity6 , the last remaining @entity10 captive in the @entity12 war , ignored congressional restrictions president @entity0 signed in the annual defense policy law that require him to notify @entity15 30 days before transferring prisoners			1
in the weeks before , administration officials and @entity19 aides working on the closure issue were optimistic that they could find a way to remove the most difficult congressional restrictions when a new law is approved later this year			0
hints at that optimism showed up in @entity0 's recent speeches , where he has mentioned his hopes to close the prison housing terror detainees after long largely avoiding the issue			1
@entity31 and @entity32 versions of the upcoming defense authorization law still contain hurdles			0
the @entity32 version would allow transfers of @entity4 prisoners to the @entity10 on the condition that the administration first submits a closure plan and @entity15 has a chance to disapprove			2
sen. @entity42 , the @entity43 chairman , who for years was cautious about @entity0 's closure plans , has warmed to the idea that shutting the prison can be done safely if the administration has laid out a plan			2
to that end , the @entity49 in recent weeks issued a legal opinion saying that @entity4 detainees transferred to the @entity10 for trial or indefinite detention under the laws of war do n't have rights under immigration law to be released on @entity10 soil			1
the @entity31 version of the bill still blocks transfers			0
the @entity31 has also issued a veto threat if the restrictions survive the period of legislative negotiation that produces a final law			0
administration officials note that @entity0 attached a notice when he signed the current defense policy law calling the restrictions unconstitutional and reserving the right to bypass the notification requirement if there was a national security interest			2
the administration has said the exchange that led to @entity6 's freedom was expedited due to fears his life was in jeopardy , though the administration had notified @entity15 that an exchange was a possibility			2
rep. @entity84 , chairman of the @entity85 , was angered by the @entity6 swap and appears to have stiffened his opposition			2
in an interview with @entity89 on sunday , @entity84 said despite @entity0 's plan to close @entity4 , " @entity15 has passed a law and he has signed a law that he will not close @entity4			1
whatever his desires are , that does not conform to the law and he is the chief administrator of the law of the nation and should uphold his constitutional obligation to follow the law			0
" a senior administration official told @entity89 that @entity0 knew his decision to secure @entity6 's release through a prisoner exchange would generate debate and would spark a discussion about both winding down the war in @entity12 and closing the prison at @entity4			1
" with respect to the closure of the detention facility at @entity4 , the president has said repeatedly -- in last year 's speech at ( @entity114 ) , in this year 's @entity115 , and in last week 's speech at @entity117 -- that he believes the continued operation of the detention facility harms our national security , " @entity122 , spokeswoman for the @entity123			1
" our policy on @entity4 is the same now as it was prior to sergeant @entity6 's recovery -- the @entity10 will repatriate , resettle , or prosecute detainees at @entity4 to the greatest extent possible , consistent with @entity10 national security interests and our humane treatment policy , " she said			1
the @entity6 exchange muddled the administration 's claim of laying the blame on @entity15 for blocking the @entity4 closure			1
@entity0 demonstrated that he believes he is justified in releasing prisoners without congressional approval			2
administration officials have said @entity0 prefers to work with @entity15 to carry out the closure			0
some democrats also have expressed qualms about @entity0 's handling of the @entity6 swap			1
sen. @entity145 said she would like @entity0 to brief the @entity146			0
@entity42 said he plans to question administration officials about what impact the 30 - day notification would have had on the prisoner exchange			0
still , he said the administration satisfied the law			0
" we received a detailed classified notification from the secretary of defense that satisfies the many substantive certification requirements of the @entity159 2014 , " @entity42 said in a statement tuesday			0
@entity42 said later that the classified notification came two days after @entity6 's release , but @entity15 had been given due notice last december that the president may choose to not follow the requirements set out by @entity15			1
" the president put @entity15 on notice on december 23 , 2013 , that he intended to exercise his powers as commander in chief , if necessary , ' to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers			0
' while the president can not change the law with a signing statement , given that notice , members of @entity15 should not be surprised that he acted as he did in the circumstances that existed			0

president @entity0 appeared to be on track to keeping a major campaign promise
he has long said he wanted to close the @entity4 detention center in @entity183
but the deal that freed @entity187 sgt. @entity6 in @entity12 *complicates* that goal
