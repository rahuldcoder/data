@entity0 , @entity1 -- the choice of @entity4 as location for the most eagerly awaited royal wedding in 30 years has taken most royal experts by surprise ; their consensus of opinion over the past week suggested that @entity11 's would oversee the marriage of prince @entity13 and @entity14			1
but on reflection , the abbey is the most obvious and perfect venue			0
by choosing it , @entity13 is showing an astute awareness of his royal status and ultimate destiny as king of @entity1			1
as a modern royal couple in a modern royal family , @entity13 and @entity14 will start their married life in the most ancient of royal buildings , stepping into the future with one foot firmly in the past and an obliging nod to those kings and queens buried there			1
designed and built as a life 's work by @entity36 , @entity4 was consecrated in 1065			2
@entity36 was too ill to attend the abbey 's opening ceremony and rounded off a particularly miserable @entity40 by dying a few days later on january 5 in the fateful year of 1066 , the year of the @entity37 ( he is the first monarch to be buried there )			0
since then , @entity4 has ruled supreme as the ultimate royal venue			2
every monarch since 1066 has been crowned at the abbey , and 17 monarchs are buried beneath its huge @entity47 arches			0
it has also seen more than its fair share of royal marriages			0
the current queen was married there , as was her father , @entity56 , and two of her children , @entity57 and @entity59			0
but inevitably , in the modern world , @entity4 is inextricably linked to the funeral of princess @entity62 , and this is the reason many considered it an inappropriate venue for @entity13 and @entity14 's wedding			1
( even today , some 12 years after the event , the harrowing image of @entity62 's coffin being carried into the abbey , draped in the royal standard and covered in lilies , reduces many to tears			1
) still , by all accounts , @entity13 and @entity14 are indeed determined to be a traditional royal couple ; despite the current recession , their wedding will be a celebration , with the pomp and circumstance only @entity81 can produce			1
neither @entity14 nor @entity13 is making any radical concession to the modern world or demanding any changes in their royal duties			1
his parents had laid much groundwork for the updating of the monarchy			0
as strange as it may seem today , @entity92 and @entity62 were once considered a thoroughly modern couple			1
they decided , for example , that @entity62 would not promise to " obey " her husband at the marriage ceremony , their first - born would be the next monarch ( as opposed to the first male child ) , and any children they did have would be brought up as close to a " normal " childhood as possible			2
( that the marriage ended in divorce is sad , but 50 percent of marriages in the @entity108 today end in divorce ; again , they were a thoroughly modern couple			0
) when @entity13 brought @entity14 out to face the world 's press last week , standing together as equals , so obviously in love , you could see how successful @entity92 and @entity62 have been			1
@entity13 and @entity14 are now the golden couple of a very modern monarchy , and it is predominantly because of the influence of his parents ( and some help from the queen ) that @entity81 's future king has embraced this position with such maturity			1
the monarchy today is a vastly different institution from the one @entity62 joined all those years ago			2
the queen now reigns over a multiracial , multifaith , multiethnic population			0
prince @entity92 has acknowledged this fact by promising to be defender of faith , as opposed to defender of the faith when he is crowned king			2
such realities give the lie to the doom merchants crawling out of the woodwork and condemning the monarchy as an archaic institution that has no role in the modern world			0
the marriage of @entity143 at @entity4 will be just the tonic a jaded @entity81 needs			2
some may scoff , but it is interesting how fast the front pages of the world 's newspapers and the schedules of the news channels were cleared once the official announcement was made last week ; proving yet again that the @entity0 is the longest - running , and best - loved , news story of them all			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .			0

@entity155 says many royal *watchers* thought @entity13 and @entity14 would wed at @entity11 's
but @entity4 is future king 's nod to the past , he says
it has power of tradition as site of royal weddings , princess @entity62 's funeral , he says
@entity169 : couple embraces tradition in monarchy modernized by @entity92 and @entity62
