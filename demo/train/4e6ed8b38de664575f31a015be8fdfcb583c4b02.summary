in the gentle yet fiercely warm surrounds of the southern @entity3 countryside , @entity0 looks on as farmhands fill his truck with sugar cane			1
packing this rough , woody crop is heavy going and making sure every inch of space is utilized is key			2
transport costs money , after all , and this humble sugar farmer has lots of costs to consider			2
" there are many challenges in this business , " @entity0 says			0
" rent for our land costs about $ 300 and then you need to pay people to clear the land			2
" you have to hire a tractor for ploughing and tilling the land			0
when you add up all these expenses , it 's a big investment			2
" searching for @entity30 in @entity3 , sugar is big business			1
this particular batch is headed for @entity34 -- one of the country 's oldest and largest factories			1
@entity38 was founded by @entity39 , an immigrant from the @entity41 subcontinent in the late 1920s			1
it 's a company still going strong to this day			1
" what you see in the background is the first mill that was installed in 1930 to crush only 150 tons of cane , " explains @entity43 , assistant general manager of @entity38 at the site of the company 's nearby factory			1
" ( @entity38 ) started expanding every 10 years , every 20 years , modernizing , acquiring more land , introducing irrigation , expanding the crushing capacity			1
by ( the 1970s ) they were producing about 83,000 tons of sugar			0
" " that was about 50 % of all the sugar produced in @entity3			1
at that time they ( @entity38 ) contributed to about 53 % of the national gdp ... just because of manufacturing and industry , " he added			1
dawn of dictatorship it was at this time , however , that history intervened in the shape of one of the 20th century 's most brutal rulers			2
after a military coup in 1971 , army commander @entity70 seized power			1
the former heavyweight boxer made himself @entity3 's president and a brutal dictatorship followed			1
the often erratic @entity70 praised @entity76 and said the @entity79 dictator " was right to burn six million @entity77			1
" he even bizarrely offered to be king of @entity81 if asked			0
within a year he had expelled the country 's @entity83 population , numbering around 35,000			1
after almost 50 years , the @entity85 were no longer welcome in @entity3			1
those who stayed , did so at their own risk			0
" when @entity70 told every @entity83 to leave , they all left the country and went mainly to the @entity91 , " @entity43 continued , adding that he believes this when @entity3 began to economically fall apart			1
" all industries collapsed , all international trade collapsed			0
there was no longer available foreign exchange to import machinery			0
even if you imported the machinery you did n't have technical expertise here to run such industries			0
" " within a few years @entity102 had collapsed , but so had infrastructure in @entity3			1
@entity105 services , everything had collapsed			0
" a new start after @entity70 was deposed in 1979 , however , some of the ejected population slowly started coming back to @entity3			1
among the returnees were the @entity111			0
the country they left behind , however , was a very different place			0
" the factory was a skeleton , " @entity43 said			0
" there was no longer a sugar plantation , the houses were occupied by anybody			0
there was no business to run so it ( the plantation ) was just an empty shell			0
" the @entity85 quickly borrowed money from the @entity126 and the @entity127 and set about rebuilding their business			0
it has grown rapidly over the last 25 years and now produces 18,000 tons of sugar ( a year ) , @entity43 said			0
but the effects of the macabre , harrowing events of recent history still linger			0
a sweeter deal ? some reports suggest some black @entity3 workers resented how certain sections of the @entity41 mercantile class treated them			1
these days , however , @entity38 says it strives to promote a responsible philosophy for how it interacts with its workers			1
not only is this the right way to engage with people in its employ , they believe , it also improves productivity and staff mobility			2
@entity38 has built schools and hospitals to cater for their staff and their families while the company has also founded the @entity155 ( @entity156 ) , an ngo that provides the likes of workshops , loans and other services for its contractors			1
besides nearly 8,000 staff members , @entity38 has almost as many contract workers in the shape of farmers , like @entity0			2
they farm the lands neighboring the plantations and are contracted to @entity38 , supplying 70 % of its sugarcane needs			2
" to be able to sustain business you want agricultural farmers , plantation workers , you want factory workers and the vision of @entity177 was to develop human resources , " @entity43 said			0
this enlightened approach saw @entity156 awarded with a best ngo - business partnership award from the @entity181			0
but it 's the positive impact on individual lives that offers the biggest reward for many in the community			2
" before @entity156 i was just useless , " said @entity187 , who has received assistance from the body 's programs			2
" i used to work as a casual laborer for other people in the community digging in their gardens to get some income			2
" when @entity156 came into existence we learned to farm , to save and how to be self - sufficient			0
" through offering a hand up to people like @entity187 , @entity38 hope to help themselves as well as provide assistance to other areas of the local economy			1
" the main vision was to always make sure that there is labor supply always available to work at the factory			0
the excess can go and work in other industries in the country , " @entity43 said			0

@entity34 is one of @entity3 's oldest companies
the company was *shuttered* when its owning @entity41 family was expelled during the reign of @entity70
today , @entity38 is once again employing *thousands* of people in @entity3
