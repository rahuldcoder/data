a tense encounter on the road			2
gunshots cutting across a neighborhood @entity4 in @entity6			2
that 's what ended the life of @entity10 -- the latest face of road rage in @entity12			1
but there are still a lot of unanswered questions in the case			2
here 's a look at some of them : authorities have identified the alleged gunman as @entity22 , who was arrested after a tense standoff thursday			1
he will face murder and two other felony charges , according to court documents			1
the other two counts are attempted murder and discharge of a firearm from a vehicle			1
she 's a 44 - year - old mother of four and grandmother of one , described by her husband as " a beautiful woman " who loved him , " her kids and ... a lot of other people			1
" " she never did anything bad to anybody , " her husband @entity42 said			1
nor did she put up with nonsense , he added , explaining that " if she was in the @entity48 , she would have been a master sergeant			2
" and , @entity42 added , " she hated bullies			2
" giving her 15 - year - old daughter a driving lesson			1
the two went to the parking lot of a nearby school , where the teen got behind the wheel			2
then they switched places , with @entity10 driving back home			2
and lt. @entity59 , a @entity6 homicide detective who is heading the investigation into @entity42 ' death , suggested this is n't unusual			2
he notes that @entity63 requires first - time drivers " to log nighttime driver hours " to get their license			2
" when i taught my children how to drive , there were certain aspects of driving that they needed to learn , " @entity59 said			2
" and one of them was driving at night			2
" nothing much out of the ordinary at the actual lesson			2
it 's what happened afterward that 's key			1
as the mother drove her daughter home , she was still giving her daughter a lesson on how to merge lanes and turn properly on a public roadway , when she spotted a " vehicle speeding up rapidly behind her , " @entity59 said			1
that vehicle , a sedan , pulled up behind her and then to the side of her			2
it was then that @entity42 ' 15 - year - old daughter " reached over while her mom was driving and honked the horn , " the detective said			1
" she was getting a driving lesson , so she figured that this person was speeding and ... needed to be corrected , " said @entity59			2
" right or wrong , she beeped the horn			2
" that got the other driver 's attention : he pulled in front of the @entity106 ' car , stopped , then walked back toward the mother and daughter			1
he said something to them -- exactly what has n't been stated publicly -- but @entity42 and her daughter are n't believed to have responded , according to the detective			1
@entity10 ' husband told @entity117 's @entity116 that the man threatened to kill his wife and daughter			1
she went back home , and told her teenage daughter to go into the house , wake up her brother @entity124 and ask him to get into the car			1
@entity126 , 22 , brought a registered gun with him			0
@entity10 was scared and upset , @entity59 said of the woman 's feelings at the time			1
she then drove back out of her neighborhood to the scene of the confrontation to see if she could find the man she 'd clashed with , the detective said			1
@entity136 said his son and wife were trying to move the car			1
they did n't want the car to be recognized in front of their home			0
but the other car , described as a gray or silver sedan , saw them , he said			0
@entity42 texted : " my wife and son drove away from home , bad guys following			1
she lost them and upon coming home turned on street , bad guys are right in front			0
" after that , bad guys open fire different location			0
my wife got home , told her son to take cover and after he saw his mom shot he opened fire three times maybe four			1
" that 's a judgment call and may depend , in part , on what transpired earlier			1
" yes , maybe in a make - up world she should have stayed home			0
please remember statement from this animal , ' i 'm going to kill you and your daughter , ' " said @entity136			1
@entity59 said only that police do n't think @entity10 did anything wrong criminally			0
her husband , who was out of state at the time , has said , " my wife paid the ultimate price for it because of the mistakes she made			1
" @entity6 detectives have given a slightly different version of events than @entity42 ' husband , saying the mother drove home to pick up her armed son and went back out to look for the suspect and his car			1
according to @entity59 , " at one point mrs. @entity10 was following what we consider a suspect vehicle			1
and then , at another point , they broke apart and mrs. @entity10 went home			0
" the detective said that the second encounter happened at least 5 minutes after @entity42 went home the first time and everything unfolded " within a couple blocks " of each other			0
she and her son got out of her car			0
then , a sedan pulled into her cul - de - sac from which someone started firing			0
@entity106 ' son , @entity124 , shot back , @entity59 said			0
the car with the shooter then backed out and drove away			0
it was then that @entity126 discovered " his mother , who was standing off to the side and behind him , had been struck by gunfire , " @entity59 said			0
it 's right after that , at 11:22 p.m. , that relatives and neighbors first alerted police			1
no one is denying that @entity126 used his gun			0
still , @entity59 said that police believe a bullet from the sedan driver 's gun -- not that of her son -- killed @entity10			1
as the standoff unfolded thursday , the victim 's husband approached reporters			1
" are you all happy ? you made my wife look like an animal ... and my son			1
there 's the animal , a block away			1
are you happy ? " @entity42 said , obviously agitated			0
speaking at a vigil tuesday , he said " there were mistakes			0
... but this particular mistake was made to keep a bigger mistake from happening			0
" " my son is not an animal , " @entity42 said			0
" my son is a hero in my book			0
" the 22 - year - old says he was just trying to protect his family			0
" everyone can think what they have to think , " @entity126 said			0
" i did it for a reason , and i 'd do it for anyone i loved			0
" road rage : cameras and guns only add to the problem they 're hurting			0
a week after the shooting , @entity10 still had n't been buried			0
but loved ones did hold the candlelight vigil , one that @entity42 said was meant " to show my respects to my wife and to let her kids get some of this grief off ( their chests ) and heal			1
" " it 's going to take a lot more than this to do it , " he added			1
@entity42 alluded to such criticism -- specifically related to the difference between the family 's initial accounts and the timeline later related by police -- in a @entity272 post			1
" i was told one version of what happened to my wife ... and i never said anything different than ( what i was ) told , " he wrote late wednesday night			1
" if all of you people ... think i was a fraud and lied about facts , i 'm truly sorry			0
" in the same @entity272 post , @entity42 said all money raised for the family via @entity284 -- an account that @entity42 said a friend started -- will be returned			0
the related @entity284 page has been shut down			0
but @entity42 told reporters that his family knew the accused gunman			0
" we know this boy			0
he knew where i lived , " he said			0
calling it an " open and ongoing investigation , " @entity59 said authorities are still piecing together exactly what happened and who is responsible			0
police are using video and other evidence to try and get " an accurate timeline and an accurate depiction of what occurred , " @entity59 said			0
" the detective did say that authorities do n't have any reason to believe that this incident is tied to anything else			0
police believe it was " an isolated incident involving road rage that ended in a tragic murder , " he said			2
