@entity0 -- @entity3 police evicted 15 @entity5 settlers from a an illegally occupied house in the restive @entity8 city of @entity9 on wednesday following a weeklong showdown between the settler community and @entity3 's @entity12 , which administers the occupied territory			1
" we are determined to make sure that the rule of law and the authority of the state of @entity3 over all its citizens will be assured			2
when there is a violation , it will be put back to track , " defense minister @entity18 told reporters shortly after the operation and explained that " the house was taken over by citizens against the law			0
" the men , women and children were removed without any violent resistance , police said			0
about two dozen settlers moved into the @entity9 house in the middle of the night last thursday , claiming they had legally purchased it from a @entity38 man			2
but @entity38 authorities , including @entity9 police chief @entity40 , disputed that the purchase was made legally			2
" our investigation shows no evidence that the house was sold to settlers by @entity38 , " @entity40 told @entity1			0
prime minister @entity48 released a statement wednesday that tried to strike a balance between demands from the settlement - supporting members of his governing coalition and the laws regulating settlement growth			1
" we strengthen the @entity5 settlements in @entity60 and @entity61 and we strengthen it in @entity9 , the city of our fathers , " he said , using the biblical term for the @entity8			1
" but there is one principle we maintain : we do all that while abiding the law and will continue to do so			0
" @entity68 , general director of the @entity9 rehabilitation committee of the @entity70 of @entity9 , said the eviction process will help to reduce tensions			1
" i believe this is a good step forward , " he said			1
@entity68 said that if the settlers appeal the eviction , " we are going to go against them and we will prove the ownership of this building to whom it belongs			2
they have evicted the settlers from the house , but they have not removed any furniture or belongings of the settlers that they have been bringing into the house since they have illegally moved in , " @entity68 said			0
responding to those claims , @entity18 stressed that the facts " will be checked according to the legal standards by the proper authorities			0
" on monday , the @entity3 @entity12 , citing the absence of required paperwork and prior notification , ordered the settlers to move out of the home by tuesday afternoon or be subject to forcible eviction			2
@entity9 is the largest and most contested city in the @entity8			1
it is home to more than 180,000 palestinians and several hundred @entity5 settlers who live in an enclave protected by the @entity3 military			0
movement for @entity38 in the area is extremely limited			0
the city , which is believed to be the biblical burial site of @entity110 , is home to the religious holy site known as the @entity113 to @entity5 and the @entity114 to @entity115			2
relations between @entity3 and @entity38 living in @entity9 have been marked by years of hostility and tension that have frequently erupted into violence			1
@entity48 asked @entity18 on monday to postpone the eviction to allow the settlers to present their legal case , but @entity18 ordered the operation to go ahead			1
the eviction triggered an immediate wave of criticism from many members of @entity48 's coalition who have become increasingly critical of @entity18 's continued role in the government			1
" defense minister @entity18 is dragging the entire government into direct confrontation with the settlers , " said @entity132 , the outspoken deputy speaker of the @entity3 @entity133 , or parliament , and @entity136 party member			0
" @entity48 must replace @entity18 without delay			2
he is running a failed political campaign on the account of the settlers			0
we will not give up and will pursue legal proceedings to allow the acquisition of the house , " he told @entity1			0
the eviction followed an announcement from @entity48 on wednesday seeking to legalize construction in the @entity8 settlements of @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			1
further development on the three @entity8 outposts has been banned , according to settlement watchdog group @entity157 , because they have been built on private @entity38 land			1
@entity48 also asked his attorney general to develop a legal solution that would prevent the planned destruction of housing units in the @entity8 settlement of @entity166 the @entity3 government is under court order to demolish the houses built in the settlement by may 1 of this year			1
@entity132 welcomed the decision and said : " these houses were built under the consent and sponsoring of the government , there is no reason to demolish them			0
" the eviction comes as the @entity3 government announced that @entity48 will meet with @entity179 prime minister @entity178 next week in an effort to restart direct negotiations			1
in retribution for the eviction , @entity68 added , @entity3 settlers from @entity185 in the old city of @entity9 burned a tent that was set up by @entity38 activists in protest of the taking over of the house			1
a spokesman for the @entity194 told @entity1 that " the structure will remain closed off until all the legal issues will be determined			0
" @entity1 's @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this report .			0
