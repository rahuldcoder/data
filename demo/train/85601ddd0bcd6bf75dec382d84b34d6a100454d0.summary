-- perhaps it is ironic that in @entity5 , a man who crafted one of the most beautiful and enriching football tapestries should be left watching the seams of his work unravel			0
while the next set of trendsetters sit with their heads craned towards the catwalk across some of the capital 's plushest venues , one of football 's great designers was left shrouded under a cloak of misery on a cold february night in north @entity21			2
as @entity24 trudged off down the @entity26 tunnel , his side soundly beaten 3 - 1 by @entity27 in the first leg of its last - 16 @entity30 clash tuesday , perhaps the reality had at last set in			1
outplayed and outclassed , the seemingly unstoppable chasm between @entity34 and @entity36 's elite shows no sign of stopping			1
when @entity24 arrived as a virtual unknown at @entity34 in october 1996 , few had the foresight to imagine just how this professorial figure would redefine the game in @entity43			1
while his look may have suggested a more school teacher like approach , the reality was anything but			0
it was art. from knitting together one of the most wonderfully aesthetic sides to have graced the @entity52 and embroidering it with gems such as @entity55 , @entity56 and the other strands of brilliance , @entity24 brought about a renaissance period in @entity43 football			2
to watch @entity24 's @entity34 in its pomp was something joyful to behold , a privilege and a delight			1
and yet while it was easy on the eye , this team was made of such strong fabric , resilient , interwoven with the dna of winners			0
those were the days when @entity56 would produce moments to take your breath away , pirouetting on a sixpence and scoring a goal which would leave you open mouthed			0
@entity55 would have you believe he was from a different planet with an outrageous flick , run and finish , while the gladiatorial @entity82 would give @entity34 the heart it so sorely lacks today			1
the likes of @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , players who would excite , produce when it mattered			0
this makes it all the more galling for @entity34 fans , who have watched their club fall dramatically from the days where it produced some of the most scintillating football ever witnessed in the @entity52			1
during the 2003/4 season , @entity34 went through an entire season unbeaten , winning 26 and drawing 12 of their 38 league games , cruising to the title by 11 points			1
that team was labeled ' @entity108 '			0
those days seem a lifetime ago			0
not since its @entity110 win in 2005 has @entity34 managed to win a trophy -- a fact which @entity24 is reminded of almost daily whenever he lifts a newspaper or turns on the radio			1
the three @entity52 titles and four @entity110 trophies are part of yesteryear as is the club 's appearance in the 2006 @entity30 final , where it was beaten by @entity122			1
in a society which demands instant gratification , @entity24 is losing the battle			0
held up as a beacon of financial prudence and a club ideally positioned for the advent of the @entity131 rules , @entity34 is constantly applauded for the way it conducts itself			1
but while the bank accounts might be full , the trophy cabinet continues to gather dust as frustration grows over the lack of progress made on the pitch			0
the sale of star players such as @entity142 and @entity143 has only exacerbated the fact that @entity34 can no longer compete with the likes of @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 over an entire season			1
being dumped out of the @entity156 , the country 's third most important domestic competition , by a @entity153 side in the bottom rung of @entity43 football , was humiliating			2
crashing out at home to first division @entity158 in the prestigious @entity110 was another embarrassing episode in a season which is unraveling at an alarming pace			0
but against @entity27 , a team seemingly cruising to domestic title success , there was a chance for redemption			1
a lesser club than @entity27 might have wilted under the disappointment of losing last year 's @entity30 final inside its own stadium in such heartbreaking fashion			1
the penalty shoot out defeat by @entity148 left its players crushed , devastated and bewildered after it had dominated for so much of the contest			0
its reply , however , speaks volumes for the team			0
a 15 point lead at the top of the @entity183 , a team with a record of 57 points from 22 games and a defense which had conceded in 450 minutes of football shows little sign of sulking			2
add to that the staggering run of away form which had seen @entity194 team win 10 out of its past 11 away games and it was obvious to see why @entity34 was up against it			1
fresh from @entity24 's outburst at the press conference tuesday and its shock @entity110 defeat by second - tier @entity158 last saturday , @entity34 began confidently			1
at least it did for the first six minutes			0
then it all went downhill			0
@entity202 international @entity201 was afforded time and space and duly took advantage , lashing home his fifth @entity30 goal and giving @entity27 the perfect start			1
that strike tore through the already fragile confidence of an @entity34 side which looked decisively anaemic			1
while @entity34 struggled , @entity27 appeared to be cut from a different cloth			1
the @entity213 swarmed around the pitch , every pass tailor made as it unpicked the stitching in @entity34 's defense with ease			1
it took just 21 minutes to leave @entity34 's dream of qualification ripped to shreds as @entity27 strengthened its grip on the contest			1
goalkeeper @entity224 could only parry @entity226 's near - post header and @entity227 was on hand to smash the ball into the roof of the net			1
the interval brought respite from the jeers which greeted the halftime whistle and gave a chance for @entity34 to regroup			1
suddenly it awoke from its nerve induced coma and began to show glimpses of what its fans so badly crave			0
that fleet of foot , that crisp passing with the wonderfully talented @entity244 trying to thread those " eye of the needle " passes to finally find a way through the @entity27 defense			1
in the end , it took some luck and an uncharacteristic piece of poor defending which allowed the home side back into the game			0
a corner was awarded when it should n't have been and @entity258 ensured his side made the most of its good fortune , heading home against his former club to reduce the deficit			0
now it was @entity34 which began to grow and only a wonderful reaction save from @entity267 denied substitute @entity268 an equalizer			2
it proved to be a crucial moment as with 13 minutes remaining , @entity270 bundled home @entity273 's cross to all but end @entity34 's hope of making the quarterfinal			1
@entity27 , which is unbeaten in 19 games since losing to @entity278 on october 28 last year , will now expect to finish the job on march 13 in @entity280			2
" we expected a very big start from @entity34 here at home with the fans behind them , " @entity27 's @entity281 told @entity282			1
" i know from my time in @entity43 and we warned all of the players we have to be there from the first minute because there will be a storm going here at the @entity26			0
" i think we did very well and of course if you score two goals you 're in a great position			2
" based on past results in the competition , @entity34 has just a 2.2 % chance of progressing to the next stage -- but in @entity301 it has one player with great heart and determination			2
it is little surprise that @entity122 's players are already beginning to voice their admiration of the midfielder in a similar way they did during the pursuit of @entity143			0
for now @entity244 remains at @entity34 and fully focused on the task in hand			2
" in the second half , we stepped it up and it 's unfortunate we did n't do that in the first half , " @entity244 told @entity282			2
" i 'm not sure why			0
maybe it 's a bit of nerves or anxiety , because we show what we can do when we play			0
we will look at it and try to put it right			0
" but while @entity24 ponders a redesign , @entity27 will surely only grow stronger			2
for next season they will have their own artist and in @entity324 , the former @entity325 coach , it will have a man who has produced one of the great works of modern football			0
in the night 's other game , @entity331 's second half strike was enough to give @entity333 a 1 - 0 win over @entity335			1
in a tight and cagey contest , @entity331 popped up six minutes after the break to take @entity339 's pass in his stride and fire home past @entity342			0
but @entity335 coach @entity343 is adamant his side can still prevail when the two teams meet again in three weeks time			2
" whether it is a good result or not we will see at the end of 180 minutes , " @entity343 told @entity347 tv station @entity346			0
" to lose is never good , but losing by just the one goal is the best thing we can take from the game			0
" for all the possession @entity333 had they did n't create many clear cut chances and even the goal itself is offside			2
" you have to give credit to @entity333 for the way they pressed us all over the pitch , but we have to apply the same pressure in @entity335			1
" we can still turn the tie around at @entity364			0
we have demonstrated this year that we can compete with anyone			0

@entity27 claims a 3 - 1 win at @entity34 in last - 16 of @entity30
@entity201 , @entity227 and @entity270 score crucial away goals
@entity333 will take 1 - 0 lead to @entity335 for second leg of last - 16 clash
@entity376 's second half strike the difference between the two sides
