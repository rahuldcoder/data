@entity0 -- when film documentarian @entity4 and other @entity6 producers banded together 13 years ago to address their underrepresentation in mass media , the mission seemed daunting and desperate , @entity2 said			2
" we used to be few hundred people that started in 1999 , very frustrated at lack of access , trying to kick down the doors " of major media and film making outlets , @entity2 told @entity1			0
" through our own community building , we finally realized that we are the ones that we were waiting for			0
" the @entity20 of @entity21 now touts a newsletter of industry trends with 10,000 subscribers , and this week the group will address how the nation 's second - largest group watches more television , buys more movie tickets and consumes more media than any other ethnicity -- and yet comprises less than 1 % of executives in @entity33			1
" we are celebrating the incredible explosion of @entity37 in the media both in front and behind the camera , " @entity2 , board chairwoman of @entity35 , said tuesday			1
" there are great improvements in the representation of @entity37 , especially in television , but there are very few directors , vice presidents and above , film and tv executives and very few at the major and mini-major studios and few in the ( talent ) agencies and the management companies , " @entity2 said			1
" that , of course , affects the opportunities that @entity37 in the media are able to take advantage of , " she said			1
the group 's efforts have taken on urgency as the latest @entity65 census shows that @entity6 have exceeded the 50 million mark and are officially the country 's second - largest population group , surpassing african - americans			1
at its annual conference beginning friday in @entity72 , @entity73 , the group will honor actress @entity74 , who has won an @entity75 , an @entity76 , a @entity77 and a @entity78 , and will feature a keynote speech by director @entity80 , who will be launching a new cable network called @entity82 for @entity6 and general audiences			1
@entity35 describes itself as the nation 's pre-eminent association for @entity6 independent film and video makers			0
the @entity35 conference , called " @entity89 , @entity90 , " is chiefly sponsored by @entity91 ( the parent company of @entity1 ) and the @entity93			0
" it 's a deeply empowering moment because it 's the one time of year when latinos in the media gather into one community , " said @entity2 , who also writes , directs and produces documentaries and feature films through her firm @entity96			1
" we have generated a really powerful feeling of belonging and an ethos of @entity6 artists supporting one another , " she said			0
the group points out how the presence of minority industry writers in film and television has been stuck at 6 % since 1999 and the percentage of minority directors is even smaller			0
meanwhile , @entity37 are estimated to spend $ 1 billion on @entity65 filmed entertainment and hold $ 1 trillion in general market buying power , @entity35 says			2
on saturday , the organization will discuss " race and the media " in a closing plenary that will look at how systemic , economic and cultural factors affect representation in mass media			2
@entity124 , a @entity35 board member and co-author with @entity127 columnist @entity126 of " news for all the people : the @entity135 and the @entity136 , " said among the ways to remedy the inequities is continued training of " the new generation of film makers			0
" advocacy groups also need to hold media companies accountable through federal laws and policy , said @entity124 , who also is senior director at the national media reform and public interest group @entity143			2
government policy " determines who are the corporate gatekeepers , who owns media outlets under mergers , and whether the @entity148 will continue to remain a communications network for people to express themselves , " @entity124 said			0
one such example is how the @entity153 and the @entity154 last year approved the merger of @entity156 and @entity157 , and now @entity156 is starting the @entity159 cable network for african - americans led by @entity161 ; the revolt network for pop music by @entity164 and @entity166 veteran @entity165 ; and @entity80 's @entity82 network , @entity124 said			0
the @entity82 network would be " the biggest opportunity , the biggest bellwether trend , for opening mainstream media to @entity37 , " @entity124 said			1
" it 's one of the biggest opportunities to come around in a while for @entity37 , to have a presence in cable television , " @entity124 said			1
" it 's going to be an opportunity for jobs and producing content			0
