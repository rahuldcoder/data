@entity0 -- the @entity2 is now collecting scans of all 10 fingerprints from foreign travelers entering the @entity6 at @entity7 , and plans to extend the program to all international airports in the country by the end of next year			1
the program -- known as @entity14 and @entity13 , or @entity6 - visit -- had previously used only two fingerprints			1
the 10 - print system gives the @entity6 the ability to compare fingerprints of travelers with criminal and terrorist databases compiled by the @entity21 , the @entity22 and others			1
the new 10 - print system was rolled out in late november at @entity7			1
speaking at an event at the airport monday , @entity2 secretary @entity25 touted the new technology : " we rely on biometrics , unique physical characteristics like fingerprints , to keep dangerous people out of the @entity6 and at the same time to keep the lines moving so that travel is fast and convenient for legitimate citizens and visitors			2
" @entity25 said the two - fingerprint version of the program , which began in 2004 , has already been successful , claiming that the program had stopped " almost 2,000 criminals and immigrant violators based on their fingerprints alone			2
" @entity44 and @entity45 using government - issued identification cards are exempt from the program			0
privacy advocates such as the @entity50 claim the system puts personal information at risk			0
a july 2007 @entity55 report found that " systems supporting the @entity6 - visit program have significant information security control weaknesses that place sensitive and personally identifiable information at increased risk of unauthorized and possibly undetected disclosure and modification , misuse and destruction			1
" @entity2 insists that there have been no privacy breaches in the @entity67			0
" moving to 10 fingerprints is completely consistent with , and in fact enhances , our ability to protect , " he said			0
" we view privacy as a fundamental human right and preserving it is an integral part of our mission			0
" travel and tourism groups fear that more barriers to international travel will make foreigners less likely to visit the @entity6			1
@entity83 , a trade group representing the tourism industry , is cautiously supporting the program , but urges a greater effort by the @entity6 to make foreign travelers aware of the program			2
" while reasonable , we must also recognize that the 10 - finger scan technology may be perceived as a barrier to entry , " said @entity89 , executive director of @entity83 , in a news release			2
" we must balance this and other barriers with clear communications and a welcoming message			0
