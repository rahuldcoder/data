-- the latest legal battle over same - sex marriage is in the hands of a panel of @entity6 federal appeals court judges			1
@entity7 , a 2008 measure approved by @entity6 voters that defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman , was the focal point of monday 's @entity15 hearing			1
opponents of the measure want the court to uphold a federal district judge 's august decision , which ruled that the proposition violated the equal protection clause of the @entity24 @entity23			1
supporters note that the proposition was approved by 52 percent of voters , and argue that it protects the " institution of marriage			1
" " i believe it 's to preserve the institution of marriage for the purposes that it has always served , " attorney @entity35 said , arguing that the key reason marriage exists in society is " that sexual relationships between men and women naturally produce children			2
" attorney @entity45 , representing opponents of proposition 8 , argued that the measure is unconstitutional and denies " the fundamental right of ... citizens to marry			2
" " @entity6 has engraved discrimination on the basis of sex and sexual orientation into its fundamental governing charter , " he said			0
ultimately , the judges ' decision could hinge as much on who 's arguing the case as what their arguments are			2
the first half of monday 's hearing focused on the legal standing of the parties appealing the federal district judge 's decision			1
that 's because @entity7 is in a " paradoxical situation , " @entity0 legal analyst @entity66 said			2
" the usual defendants when you challenge a law of the state are the governor and attorney general of that state			0
but the governor and attorney general of @entity6 , @entity80 and @entity81 , both agree with the plaintiffs that @entity7 is unconstitutional , " he said			0
so in their place , other groups have stepped in to defend the measure			0
the question , @entity66 explained , is " do they have the legal right to be there ? " along those lines , the three - judge panel opened monday 's hearing with tough questioning of parties seeking to appeal the decision , including @entity96 and @entity97 , deputy clerk and deputy commissioner of civil marriages for @entity100 , @entity6 , where voters overwhelmingly approved @entity7			1
" what 's your best case to allow for your standing in federal court ? " one judge asked attorney @entity35 , representing @entity96			0
" your honor , i do n't have a case , " @entity35 responded , referring to relevant past court decisions			0
@entity35 later urged the panel to consider the @entity6 @entity114 's earlier ruling in favor of @entity7 " if you do n't agree with me that we have standing			1
" later judge @entity117 questioned attorney @entity118 , who represented @entity119 , about how a deputy clerk , instead of the clerk , could have legal standing in the appeal			0
@entity118 told the court that the county clerks are local officers , but they perform state functions such as civil marriages			0
monday 's hearing was the latest in a long - running battle over same - sex marriage in @entity6			1
the state 's high court had allowed same - sex marriage , but then the 2008 @entity7 voter referendum passed with 52 percent of the vote			1
the @entity6 @entity114 subsequently allowed that initiative to stand , saying it represented the will of the people			0
two same - sex couples filed a federal challenge , saying the law violated 14th @entity143 constitutional protections of due process and equal protection			1
on august 4 , @entity24 district judge @entity146 agreed , ruling that the voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage violated the equal protection clause of the @entity24 @entity23			1
" @entity7 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license , " @entity146 , who was appointed to the federal bench by former president @entity151 , wrote in his 136 - page opinion			2
" indeed , the evidence shows @entity7 does nothing more than enshrine in the @entity160 the notion that opposite - sex couples are superior to same - sex couples			1
" same - sex marriage is currently legal in five states and in the @entity166			2
the five states are @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171			0
@entity146 's landmark ruling led to a swift federal appeal that could ultimately reach the @entity114			0
@entity0 's @entity174 and @entity175 contributed to this report .			0
