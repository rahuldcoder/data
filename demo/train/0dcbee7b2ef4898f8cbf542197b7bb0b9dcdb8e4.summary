-- the 15 - year - old @entity4 youth who was shot and killed by a @entity5 agent had a history of involvement with human smuggling and was on a list of repeat juvenile offenders , @entity2 spokesman @entity1 told @entity0 thursday			1
the victim , @entity11 , had been apprehended by @entity13 officials on more than one occassion but was never criminally charged , @entity1 said			0
the use of juveniles to smuggle people across the border is a common tactic for smugglers , he said			2
meanwhile , a video obtained by @entity0 casts doubt on the @entity5 agent 's claim that he was surrounded by rock - throwing suspected illegal immigrants when he fatally shot the boy on the border at @entity27			1
@entity0 obtained the video , which was shot by a witness on a cell phone camera from the @entity4 side of the border , from affiliate @entity33			1
the video aired on its program @entity36 late wednesday evening			2
the video shows part of the buildup before the incident , with several individuals running underneath the @entity42 , a railroad span that connects the two countries			1
monday night 's incident started around 6:30 p.m. when @entity5 agents responded to a report of a group of suspected illegal immigrants being smuggled into the @entity13 near the @entity53 port of entry , @entity46 special agent @entity45 said			1
in the distance , a @entity13 @entity5 officer on a bicycle can be seen making his way toward the area			1
seconds later , the officer can be seen getting off the bicycle and approaching two of the four suspected @entity4 nationals who had just crossed through an opening in the fence			1
one of the suspects is detained by the officer , but never handcuffed , and is dragged a short distance			2
this happened on the @entity13 side of the border			0
moments later , the officer points what appears to be his firearm in the direction of a second suspect , standing about 60 feet away from the officer -- on the @entity4 side of the border			1
the video shows the suspect running away			2
seconds later , two gunshots can be heard on the video			2
a third gunshot is heard in a different sequence of the tape			0
after the shooting , another suspect is seen running in the upper left side of screen away from the incident			1
" they 're throwing rocks , " witnesses screaming in @entity88 can be heard in the background of the video as the officer opens fire			1
" they hit him ... they hit him			0
" the video contradicts @entity45 ' account			0
she had said : " this agent , who had the second subject detained on the ground , gave verbal commands to the remaining subjects to stop and retreat			2
however , the subjects surrounded the agent and continued to throw rocks at him			2
the agent then fired his service weapon several times , striking one subject who later died			0
" a federal law enforcement official told @entity0 that the @entity46 's use of the word " surrounded , " was " probably not the best choice of words , " and that it is more accurate to say that people were nearby throwing rocks			1
the @entity46 has been studying videos of the incident and said some of the video does show rocks being thrown at the @entity5 agents , the official said			1
@entity11 was a secondary student in @entity27			0
" the young man was not armed , " said @entity123 , @entity27 spokesman			0
" he did not have the physical size to threaten anyone			0
the aggression ( by the @entity13 agent ) is evident			0
" @entity129 said @entity11 was shot in the head			0
" my people have spoken to his family			0
his dad says he was a straight - a student			0
his secondary school even sent him on an academic trip because of his good grades , " mayor @entity134 said			0
a memorial for @entity11 was to be held in @entity27 thursday morning , according to @entity139			0
local politicians were expected to attend			0
reports that the @entity4 military may have drawn weapons on @entity5 agents , which surfaced earlier wednesday , could not be immediately confirmed			1
the tape released by @entity33 did not show any @entity4 military troops			1
" we are aware of those reports , but i can not confirm them to you at this time , " said @entity4 military spokesman @entity147			2
" i plan on speaking with the individuals who are said to have been involved , but i ca n't and wo n't confirm that to you			0
" the @entity4 government has requested a quick and transparent investigation into the fatal shooting			1
@entity4 " reiterates that the use of firearms to repel a rock attack represents a disproportionate use of force , particularly coming from authorities who receive specialized training on the matter , " the @entity158 said tuesday in a news release			1
@entity45 told @entity0 earlier that she did not know whether the person who was shot was on the @entity4 or @entity13 side of the border , but the agent never left @entity13 territory			1
the body was found on the @entity4 side of the border , @entity45 said			2
peaceful protests against the @entity13 @entity5 were held in @entity27 on wednesday , near the site of the fatal shooting			1
in video shot by @entity0 affiliate @entity180 , a man holding a bullhorn is seen pacing back and forth on the dusty streets of @entity27 , pleading " @entity185 " to any passerby who would listen			0
the shooting comes less than two weeks after the may 31 death of a @entity4 illegal immigrant who had been detained three days earlier by border agents in @entity189			1
a suspect identified as @entity191 was initially detained on the @entity193 levee , said the @entity46 , which is leading the investigation			0
" the growing frequency of this type of event reflects a worrisome increment in the use of excessive force on the part of some border authorities , " the @entity4 @entity158 said			2
according to the ministry , the number of @entity4 who have been killed or wounded by @entity13 border authorities has increased from five in 2008 to 12 in 2009 and 17 so far this year			1
earlier , @entity1 , the @entity2 spokesman , said he could not comment because he does not know where the @entity4 government obtained its statistics			1
but @entity1 said there were 799 assaults on border agents from october 1 , 2009 , through may 31 -- up from 745 assaults for the same time period in 2007 - 08 and 658 for the same span in 2008 - 09			0
lethal force , he said , is allowed " when an agent is in imminent threat of physical or bodily harm , which could cause death or injury or in protection of an innocent third party			2
" the determination of when to use lethal force , @entity1 said , is made by each individual agent at the scene			0
from october 1 through may 31 , he said , @entity230 and @entity2 agents used their firearms 31 times			0
rock - throwing can be considered a dangerous assault , @entity1 said : " they 're not chunking pebbles			1
" @entity0 's @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239 contributed to this report .			0
