@entity0 -- her teachers knew she loved to doodle on her tests and homework , but no one thought @entity8 's drawing skills would raise more than $ 110,000 to help birds affected by the @entity11 oil spill			1
the 11 - year - old wrote to the @entity13 and told them she had an idea that could help raise money			1
" i am a decent drawer , and i was wondering if i could sell some bird paintings and give the profits to your organization , " the letter said			0
the idea got some attention			2
" many people are outraged and do n't know where to vent that because they ca n't drive to the beach and help			0
so what @entity8 has done has set a beautiful example by using her skills and creating an initiative that is fruitful for everyone , " said @entity32 , the senior communications manager for @entity13			1
it was an innovative idea , but no one expected her efforts to pull in more than $ 90,000 , and a $ 25,000 donation from @entity37 , after it signed on to host her initiative as part of @entity37 artists profiles			2
@entity8 has promised to send original paintings to her first 500 donors who helped her raise $ 25,000			1
she 's completed about half of them and plans to spend her summer sending out the remaining paintings			0
she 's a resident of @entity47 , @entity0 , but her father grew up in @entity49 , @entity50 , and she visits her grandparents as well as her cousins in @entity53			0
aside from her family , @entity8 knew that the birds were also suffering from the oil spill in the @entity11			1

the @entity65 profile page launched june 8 , and donations have poured in over the past week			0

" this is new to have this kind of outpouring of a response , it 's very unique , " @entity72 said			0
" in my experience , i 've never seen an outpouring like this			0
it 's a beautiful gesture			0
" @entity8 said that @entity82 , the @entity84 - @entity83 ornithologist who painted and described the birds of @entity86 in his book " @entity89 , " was her inspiration			1
although @entity8 says she took " one little class " on drawing , she has created about 180 paintings of different birds			1
after giving money to @entity8 's initiative , donors can e-mail the receipt to @entity98 and they will receive one of five prints selected from the original paintings she has created			1
most of her drawing experience comes from doodling on tests and homework			0
when @entity8 sits down to make a painting , she leafs through the " @entity107 of @entity108 " or the @entity109 and reads facts about the birds			1
@entity8 , who said she wants to attend @entity112 and be an ornithologist , told @entity1 that she became interested in birds at age 4 after she read a book on the topic			1
she 's been hooked ever since			0
@entity8 loves to go bird watching and names the @entity120 and the @entity121 as two of her favorites			2
the @entity13 had the first volunteers on the ground after they were called to the @entity126 by the @entity127 , @entity72 said			2
members will use the donated money to support volunteers , staff and stock rehabilitation centers , and find transportation for the birds			2
although they are limited by regulations stipulating who can touch the contaminated birds , volunteers can help transport the birds in containers to rehabilitation centers and patrol beaches looking for injured birds			0
