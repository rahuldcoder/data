-- an ice floe forced oil giant @entity3 to call off its preparatory drilling off @entity5 just a day after the controversial work started , the company announced monday			1
the drifting chunk of ice , more than 32 miles long by 12 miles wide , forced the drill ship @entity10 to move off the planned well as a precaution , company spokesman @entity11 said			1
but the ship will be re-anchored within the next few days , and drilling will resume , @entity11 said			0
@entity3 began work on its planned well in the @entity16 , about 90 miles off the @entity17 , on sunday			1
the @entity18 granted the company permission to begin " certain limited preparatory activities " -- including work related to the installation of a blowout preventer -- on august 30			2
@entity3 's plans had been held up by @entity26 's disastrous 2010 oil spill in the @entity27 , which prompted a review of offshore drilling plans			1
environmental groups argued against the project , warning that a spill would be difficult to plug and clean up in the remote and inhospitable @entity33			1
@entity3 says it 's working at far less depth and lower pressures than the @entity26 well that erupted off @entity37 , destroying the @entity39 drill rig and killing 11 men aboard			1
but @entity41 , the mayor of the @entity17 coastal town of @entity43 , said he 's keeping a wary eye on the @entity3 operation and has concerns about what the future will bring			2
" there 's nothing we can do now but i worry about the weather and the animals we depend on for our survival , " he said			0
if " @entity3 finds what it thinks is down there then many other companies are going to come and then it will only be a matter of time before something happens out there			2
" the @entity61 estimates more than 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas may be recoverable			0
the shrinking of the region 's sea ice -- which hit record lows this year -- has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region			0
the amount of the @entity33 covered by sea ice fell in late august to the lowest point since satellite observations began in 1979 , the @entity72 reported			1
that trend has stretched into september , with 45 % less coverage than september conditions in the 1980s and 1990s			0
climate researchers say this decrease in sea ice a symptom of a warming climate , caused largely by the combustion of carbon - rich fossil fuels			0
the science is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most scientists			0
