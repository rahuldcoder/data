@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 president @entity3 stepped down friday and handed over power to the military , his nearly three decades of iron rule ended by a groundswell of popular protests that began january 25			1
in a somber , one - minute announcement on state television , vice president @entity9 announced @entity3 's resignation and said the @entity16 will " run the affairs of the country			1
" as @entity9 spoke , deafening cheers erupted among tens of thousands of @entity0 who thronged the streets of @entity1			2
it was a moment they had sought throughout long , often tense days of demonstrations -- some of them violent -- that demanded @entity3 's departure			1
it was a moment that many in the @entity30 world 's powerhouse nation had not dared contemplate			0
chants of " @entity0 is free ! " and " @entity32 is great ! " rose from the crowds , dizzy in the honeymoon of their success			2
some waved @entity0 flags ; others honked horns ; still others set off fireworks as they savored the scene			2
two major bridges over the @entity45 resembled congested parking lots , and partiers packed streets throughout @entity1			0
the state - run @entity49 said some people had passed out from joy and others had suffered heart attacks			1
" it was a sense of liberation for me , for every @entity0 , " said opposition leader @entity55			2
" for the first time , @entity0 has a chance to be democratic , to be free , to have a sense of dignity , of freedom			2
it 's just like something we never experienced in our lifetime			0
" a source with close connections to @entity71 government leaders said @entity3 , 82 , had fled to the @entity73 resort town of @entity74 , his presidency finished as abruptly as it had started in 1981 , when he ascended to power after the assassination of @entity78			2
the repercussions echoed far beyond @entity80 as the @entity82 government moved friday to freeze assets belonging to @entity3 and his family , said @entity85 , a spokesman for the @entity86 in @entity87			2
in a speech to the nation thursday night , @entity3 had indicated that he was delegating authority to @entity9 but made no mention of resigning			2
disappointed crowds calling for his ouster grew in number friday in @entity1 and in other major cities			0
by friday night , the protesters got what they were seeking			0
but amid the euphoria , @entity55 sounded a note of caution			0
" we have challenges ahead of us , " said the @entity102 laureate , who some believe could emerge as @entity0 's next leader			1
" i think we need to not worry about retribution			0
@entity3 needs to go , and we need to look forward			2
" @entity107 , the @entity0 secretary - general of the @entity108 , told @entity2 that the country should focus on instituting reforms and establishing democracy			1
asked how long it would take for the government to lift the 30 - year - old state - of - emergency laws , he said , " the sooner the better ... six , seven months			1
" asked whether he will run for office , @entity107 demurred			2
" that is not an issue to discuss today , " he said			0
" the time for such a question will come			0
" @entity120 , the @entity0 activist who became a reluctant hero of the revolution but has made clear that he has no interest in becoming a political leader , predicted that history books would describe @entity3 as a dictator			1
@entity120 -- a @entity127 executive on leave from his job whose @entity131 page is credited with triggering the uprising -- was seized by security forces and held for 10 days			0
his powerful television interview after his release monday galvanized the protesters in @entity80			0
he said he had felt certain that @entity3 would be forced out after a revolt in @entity138 forced that country 's leader to step down in january , and he said he believed the @entity0 military could be trusted to respect the demands of the protesters			1
many protesters had been calling for @entity0 's army , which is respected within the country , to take over as interim caretaker			1
friday night , they voiced optimism that the military would pave the way for free and fair elections			0
throughout the uprising , the military both responded to the protesters and defended @entity3 's regime			1
it showed signs thursday that it was assuming a greater role when the supreme council met without @entity3 , who was then still the supreme commander of the armed forces			2
friday , it issued a communique stating that @entity0 's emergency laws , used by @entity3 throughout his tenure as president to rule with an iron hand , would be lifted , but only when conditions allowed			1
after @entity3 stepped down , a military spokesman appeared on state television , expressing appreciation to the former president and saluting the " martyrs , " an apparent reference to those who died in the protests			1
@entity170 has documented more than 300 deaths since the uprising began january 25			0
many of the pitched battles between security forces and @entity3 's foes unfolded in the same places that were scenes of jubilation friday night			1
but friday 's revelry could not push aside the looming uncertainty over what will come next in the @entity30 world 's most populous nation and how @entity0 's revolution , which succeeded on the 32nd anniversary of @entity187 's , might affect the region			1
events in @entity0 may extendfar beyond the country 's borders , @entity107 said			1
" winds of change are sweeping the @entity30 world and the @entity195 , " he said			0
in @entity87 , @entity197 president @entity196 said the people of this key @entity197 ally have made it clear that " nothing less than genuine democracy will carry the day			1
" he praised the @entity0 military for acting responsibly and said it now needs to help ensure a credible transition			2
among other things , @entity0 authorities need to set about " protecting the rights of @entity0 's citizens , lifting the emergency law , revising the constitution and other laws to make this change irreversible , and laying out a clear path to elections that are fair and free , " @entity196 said			1
but two miles from the @entity215 , at a meeting of the @entity217 , rep. @entity218 , @entity219 , said that the @entity197 had invested billions of dollars over the years " propping up that dictator " and has little to show for it			1
" where do you think the money went ? to a @entity82 bank account , " he said			0
" it contributed to our debt , billions and billions of dollars , and all we get is chaos from it and instability			0
" a spokesman for @entity196 's predecessor said friday that former president @entity238 " congratulates the people of @entity0 for taking an important and impressive first step toward freedom			1
" but the @entity197 government 's applause for @entity0 's step toward freedom and away from @entity3 differed markedly from its previous stance			1
at a joint news conference with @entity3 in april 2004 at @entity238 's ranch in @entity247 , @entity248 , he offered support for his @entity0 counterpart			1
" @entity0 is a strategic partner of the @entity197 , and we value president @entity3 's years of effort on behalf of the peace and stability of the @entity195 , " @entity238 said			1
" president @entity3 can be confident in my friendship and @entity197 's partnership as he moves forward to realize the hopes of his people			1
" just where those hopes would lead was not clear in the heady hours after @entity3 's resignation			2
what was clear was that @entity3 's imposition of military rule broke with @entity0 's 1971 constitution			1
the constitution allows for only two scenarios for a president to relinquish power			0
the first stipulates that if the president has to step aside temporarily , the vice president steps into the top role			0
that is what the regime briefly orchestrated thursday			0
the constitution states further that , if the office of the president is vacated or the president becomes permanently disabled , the parliamentary speaker is to assume the role until new elections can be held			0
those elections , in turn , must occur within 60 days			0
in opting for a third way , which put all power in the hands of the military , the regime in effect rendered the constitution inoperable			0
a high - ranking @entity0 military official said the army 's command was discussing whether to dismiss @entity3 's government and parliament and when the next election would be held			1
but some analysts were sounding the alarm over the takeover by the military , which has suddenly become accountable for the nation			0
" @entity9 's statement is the clearest indication thus far that the military has carried out a coup led by defense minister field marshal @entity310 , " analysts with @entity305 , a global intelligence company , said in a statement			0
" @entity0 is returning to the 1952 model of ruling the state via a council of army officers , " the statement said			2
" the question now is to what extent the military elite will share power with its civilian counterparts			0
" @entity320 warned that @entity3 's departure did not mean an end to the police state			1
" the repressive system that @entity0 have suffered under for three decades has not gone away and the state of emergency remains in place , " said @entity324 , @entity320 's secretary general			1
" those in power must grasp this opportunity to consign the systematic abuses of the past to history			0
human rights reform must begin now			0
" @entity2 's @entity335 , @entity336 , @entity337 and @entity338 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity107 says it could take 7 months before state - of - emergency laws can be lifted
@entity197 has invested billions " propping up that dictator , " rep. @entity218 says of @entity3
@entity196 says the " transition must bring all of @entity0 's voices to the table "
