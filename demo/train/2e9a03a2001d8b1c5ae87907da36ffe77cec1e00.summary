-- the 2012 presidential race has been dominated by one issue : the economy			1
@entity4 are desperately looking for a leader who can steer the country into full recovery ; anything else is peripheral at this point			0
this past weekend , however , the presidential race was harmfully thrown off course			1
i 'm referring to the words of pastor @entity13 of the @entity14 of @entity15 , @entity16			2
@entity13 introduced @entity16 gov. @entity17 at the @entity18 in @entity19 on friday and strongly endorsed him , primarily because of his evangelical @entity21 beliefs			1
shortly after the introduction , @entity13 said to reporters : " every true , born - again follower of @entity25 ought to embrace a @entity21 over a @entity26			1
" @entity13 called @entity27 a " cult , " and asked by a reporter if he believed gov. @entity29 is a @entity21 , answered , " no. " @entity29 , of course , is @entity32			1
@entity13 ' words echoed what he said in 2008 about @entity29 , when he told the @entity35 at its annual meeting : " the value of electing a @entity21 goes beyond public policies ... it is worse to legitimize a faith that would lead people to a separation from @entity43			1
" in essence , @entity13 implied that voting for @entity29 would give credibility to a cult			1
after hearing @entity13 ' remarks , i decided to respond when i spoke at the same summit on saturday			2
the @entity29 campaign contacted me before my speech about another speaker , @entity52 , who has a history of controversial remarks concerning @entity27			1
but @entity29 's campaign had no say in my words to @entity13			1
i said to @entity13 , along with everyone else , " do not give voice to bigotry			2
remember @entity60 , his manly advice to us , to despise all forms of racial and religious bigotry			2
he who was first in war , first in peace , and first in the hearts of his countrymen , counseled , ' we should give to bigotry no sanction , to persecution no assistance			0
' " let 's follow him			0
and i would say to pastor @entity13 , you stepped on and obscured the words of @entity17 and @entity76 and @entity77 and @entity78 and everyone else who has spoken here			1
you did @entity17 no good , sir , in what you had to say			2
" i agree that there are serious theological differences between evangelical @entity84 and @entity27			2
but those should be settled in churches , in homes , and in religious gatherings , not in front of a national political event			2
pastor @entity13 says his words were merely theological			0
he , pastor of a successful mega-church , should know full well the fine line between religion and politics			0
his words were clearly political , as evidenced by the damaging effect it had on the @entity100 presidential candidates and the national debate			0
gov. @entity17 immediately had to distance himself from @entity13 ' words			1
gov. @entity29 quickly went on the defensive			0
and the other candidates , instantly grilled by the national media about their view of @entity27 , were thrown into a controversy they wanted no part of			0
@entity13 ' words were an inappropriate and deleterious distraction			0
@entity112 of the @entity113 states that " no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the @entity4			1
" the purpose of a political gathering like the @entity18 is to build consensus around a candidate by examining positions and records			0
yes , religion plays an essential role in those decisions , but one person 's faith should never be a disqualifying factor , whether that person is @entity131 , @entity21 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity32 , or of any other faith			1
to the right and left alike , we are in the middle of a grueling presidential campaign season			0
it behooves us to despise and reject all forms of religious , and racial , bigotry			1
politics are about policy and deciding whether a candidate shares your views of the founding principles of this country -- life , liberty , and the rule of law -- which men and women of all different faiths can agree upon			2
when @entity157 spoke in 1838 to the @entity158 of @entity159 , @entity160 , concerning the " perpetuation of our political institutions , " he admonished participants : " let reverence for the laws ... become the political religion of the nation			0
" we do not need , nor should we have , a religious test for public office			1
should we choose to hold someone 's faith against him or her , we hurt only ourselves			1
our chances of winning the 2012 presidential election depend on building the broadest coalition we can , not breaking it down			0
i do not question the theological knowledge of pastor @entity13 , and , to his credit , he has said that he would vote for @entity29 should he win the nomination			2
nevertheless , his comments were ill - timed and of poor taste			0
again , the timeless wisdom of @entity60 comes to mind			0
in a letter to the @entity186 of @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity19 wrote , " may the children of the @entity190 , who dwell in this land , continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants , while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree , and there shall be none to make him afraid			0
" the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			0

@entity204 : @entity13 ' comments about @entity29 's faith hurt presidential race
@entity13 , a @entity17 *supporter* , said @entity29 is not a @entity21 and @entity27 is a cult
@entity204 says we must reject religious , and racial , bigotry ; politics are about policy
there is no religious test for public office and it 's a matter of political principles , he says
