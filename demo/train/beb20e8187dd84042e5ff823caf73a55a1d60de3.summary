his reputation is in tatters , the cycling victories that made him a legend are wiped away , and the sponsors that gave him enormous wealth have fled faster than a downhill race to a finish line			0
but that 's only the beginning			0
@entity13 is also being asked to pay back millions of dollars			1
and the term " @entity13 era " is now apparently a moniker for widespread cheating			1
the epic downfall of cycling 's star , once an idolized icon of millions around the globe , stands out in the history of professional sports			0
his latest and biggest plunge came monday when the @entity27 stripped the 41 - year - old of his seven @entity30 titles			1
@entity32 bracelet : to wear or not to wear ? " @entity13 has no place in cycling , " said the union 's president , @entity33 , announcing that @entity13 is also banned from the sport			1
the decision followed this month 's finding by the @entity40 that there is " overwhelming " evidence @entity13 was involved as a professional cyclist in " the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program			1
" @entity13 has steadfastly maintained his innocence			1
@entity33 said he was " sickened " by the report			0
but he emphasized , " cycling has a future			0
" in a statement , the union wrote , " today 's young riders do not deserve to be branded or tarnished by the past or to pay the price for the @entity13 era			1
" the group , which officially goes by its @entity56 name @entity27 , or @entity27 , is the cycling 's world governing body			1
how an all - american hero fell to earth following the union 's announcement , the @entity61 said it was reissuing its call for @entity13 to return 2.95 million euros -- nearly $ 4 million -- that he collected for winning the tours			1
and $ 4 million might be a trifle compared to what @entity67 wants back			1
the @entity70 insurance company covered bonuses that @entity13 was promised if he won the @entity30			1
in 2002 , it paid him $ 1.5 million ; in 2003 , $ 3 million , according to a @entity74 article that @entity67 posted on its website			2
but after his 2005 victory , @entity67 withheld a promised $ 5 million bonus , citing reports that @entity13 had doped			1
he fought back in court and won			0
@entity67 had to pay not only the $ 5 million but also attorneys ' costs and fees , bringing the total that year to $ 7.5 million			2
the ruling as it happened so the company could seek as much as $ 12 million back			1
in a statement monday , @entity67 said it was " considering all legal options to pursue a return of the funds paid by @entity67 to mr. @entity13			1
" meanwhile , one of the sponsors that had n't yet given up on @entity13 dropped out monday			2
he was once " a symbol of possibility , " @entity93 -- which has outfitted him in sunglasses and other gear -- said in a statement , adding that it looks " forward with hope to athletes and teams of the future who will rekindle that inspiration by racing clean , fair and honest			0
" heavyweights such as @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 have already fled team @entity13 , though , like @entity93 , they 've vowed to continue supporting the @entity32 , which fights cancer through a program widely known as @entity32			2
@entity13 does get to keep one prized possession from his @entity30 days			1
the @entity116 , which runs the 21 - day tour , told @entity118 it will not ask him to return the yellow jerseys he won			0
@entity13 did not comment monday			2
at an event sunday , he did not refer to the controversy directly but said it 's been " an interesting and at times very difficult few weeks			0
" " people ask me a lot how are you doing , " he told participants in his foundation 's annual ride for the @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity70			1
" and i tell them i 've been better , but i 've also been worse			0
" though in the past he has often tweeted angry responses against those who accused him of doping , @entity13 has remained uncharacteristically quiet in recent days			2
his attorneys did not immediately respond to @entity118 's requests for comment monday , and the foundation said it would not make a statement			0
@entity13 's story -- that of an outspoken cancer survivor who tamed the grueling three - week race more than any other cyclist before or since -- had made him a household name			1
but allegations of doping long dogged his career			0
then came the @entity40 finding			0
highlights of @entity40 report the agency announced it would ban @entity13 from the sport for life and strip him of his results dating from 1998			2
the decision wiped out 14 years of his career			0
@entity33 said monday the cycling union would not appeal @entity40 's decision			0
@entity33 , speaking at a news conference , said he does not believe cycling will ever be free from doping , because " i do n't think in any aspect of society there are no cheats			0
i do believe that doping can be hugely reduced			0
" the keys are education programs and how teams are structured , he said			0
monday 's news conference turned somewhat contentious as reporters asked whether the cycling union had looked the other way for years despite growing allegations of widespread doping in the sport			2
@entity13 had made two donations to the union for anti-doping technology			2
@entity33 insisted his organization never ignored the concerns raised about possible doping			0
and he wrote off any suggestion that @entity13 's contributions had led the organization to make any decision on the issue			1
" the @entity27 has tested @entity13 218 times			1
if @entity13 was able to beat the system , then the responsibility for addressing that rests not only with the @entity27 but also with " the anti-doping agencies that accepted the results , the cycling union said in its statement			1
the @entity194 also is reviewing the evidence and could revoke @entity13 's bronze medal from the @entity197			1
with @entity13 's disgrace , will anything change ? the cycling union will meet later this week to discuss whether to award the seven @entity30 titles -- from 1999 to 2005 -- to another rider			1
the group 's announcement monday leaves @entity204 as the only @entity205 to win the tour			2
he did so in 1986 , 1989 and 1990			0
@entity205 cyclist @entity207 was stripped of his 2006 @entity30 victory in 2010			1
in the past , @entity13 has argued that he took more than 500 drug tests and never failed			2
in its 202 - page report , the @entity40 said it had tested @entity13 less than 60 times and the @entity27 conducted about 215 tests			1
" thus the number of actual controls on mr. @entity13 over the years appears to have been considerably fewer than the number claimed by @entity13 and his lawyers , " the @entity40 said			2
the agency did n't say that @entity13 ever failed one of those tests , but his former teammates testified as to how they beat tests or avoided the test administrators altogether			0
several riders also said team officials seemed to know when random drug tests were coming , the report said			0
@entity13 stepped down last week as chairman of his foundation but said he will continue to be involved			0
some of the foundation 's donors are furious over the scandal and want their money back			0
" we will not be deterred , " @entity13 said friday night at the organization 's 15th anniversary celebration in @entity128			1
" we will move forward			0
" doping scandal costs @entity13 sponsors , charity			0

a @entity70 insurance firm could seek as much as $ 12 million back from @entity13
@entity61 wants cyclist to return nearly $ 4 million from @entity30 wins
@entity27 's president *rejects* suggestion group looked the other way
@entity13 has long maintained his innocence
