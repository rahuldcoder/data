-- 2014 marks an exciting new year for " @entity2 " fans			1
the show 's fourth season kicks off on @entity5 on sunday , and 1922 promises to be another scandal - filled time for the @entity9 family and their busy staff			1
the season just ended in the @entity13 , but now @entity15 fans will have their chance to get wrapped up in the latest drama brewing within those @entity13 walls			1
@entity19 brought us tragic deaths , new additions to the family and staff , and @entity25			1
what will the next set of episodes hold ? here are the five things we are looking forward to over the next eight weeks : 1			2
how will @entity30 move on from tragedy ? @entity19 ended with a bang			0
hours after @entity30 gave birth to a son , her husband , @entity33 , was killed in a car crash			0
season 4 picks up six months after the accident , and we will find out how the eldest of the @entity9 siblings is handling life as a widowed mother			1
is she still in mourning or working to find the perfect suitor ? @entity30 's biggest plight in the series has been her search for the right man , and now she 's got to consider picking it up again , this time with a small piece of baggage			0
perhaps she will devote all her time and energy to her new son			0
or will she resent the child as a constant reminder of her lost love ? @entity33 was in the midst of making changes at @entity2 to help the @entity2 regain its financial footing , and now his wife must take on those duties			1
our guess is , the warmth brought out by @entity33 has since frozen over			0
expect to see the cold , emotionally closed - off @entity30 we knew so well at the beginning of the series			2
also , we will almost certainly see @entity30 don nothing but black			0
she is in mourning , after all			0
diversity at @entity2 ! that 's right , after three seasons , we will finally see a person of color on the show ! @entity2 has never been known for its diversity , but viewers know social change is on the horizon			1
it was only a matter of time before it creeps into those hallowed halls			0
while @entity87 's casting may have been nothing more than a @entity90 joke , season 4 will in fact include the show 's first recurring black character			2
@entity94 has been cast as a charismatic jazz singer and will hopefully give us a glimpse into the characters ' feelings about the changing face of race in the 1920s			2
with @entity105 's penchant for jazz clubs revealed in the finale , it 's a safe bet the two will cross paths this season			2
will this be the last we see of @entity112 ? with @entity33 gone , what does that mean for his dear mother ? @entity112 has played a major part in the series since her son 's introduction in season 1			2
now that we must get used to life without @entity33 , how much longer will we get to spend with the family he brought with him ? fans will surely get a glimpse into @entity112 's grieving period since the huge loss			0
it will be interesting to see whether she remains a lead character on the series with only a grandson connecting her to @entity2			1
with @entity30 inevitably trapped in a state of depression , perhaps it will be @entity112 who comes to her rescue and helps raise the newborn heir			0
how much time will we have to spend with @entity105 ? viewers were introduced to @entity140 at the tail end of season 3 , and the rebellious teen did n't make the best impression			2
she had been invited to stay at @entity2 while her parents travel to @entity146			1
if the previews are anything to go by , we 're going to see much more of the troublemaker in coming episodes			0
with a dark cloud still hanging over the @entity2 after the shocking deaths of both @entity33 and @entity153 , @entity105 might provide a much - needed bright spot to the house			1
what 's next for @entity2 's downstairs ? season 3 wrapped with most of @entity2 's downstairs players riding cloud nine			1
@entity161 and @entity162 have become the show 's most loving pair since the former 's release from prison			0
@entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 became involved in an innocent love triangle			0
even the conniving @entity172 made peace with those he 's wronged			0
the finale gave the staff a chance to get out of their uniforms and spend some time bonding in the sun. expect some major changes within the hard - working team in the new season			1
a major player will be taking time away from @entity2 , making room for a few shakeups			1
since @entity188 's been living as a widower for nearly two years , the former chauffeur may have to pay special attention to the latest addition			0
and with @entity194 now jobless , @entity33 's former butler and valet will be in search of new work			0
did we mention fans can expect both special guest star @entity199 and another helping of @entity25 in the roles of @entity202 and his mother , @entity203 ? there 's nothing we look forward to more than one - liner standoffs between @entity203 and the @entity207			1
there 's never a dull moment at @entity2 !			1
