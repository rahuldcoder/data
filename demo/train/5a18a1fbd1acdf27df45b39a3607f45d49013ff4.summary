-- @entity1 will not visit @entity2 until 2014 after next year 's race was scrapped following a row between @entity6 oil firm @entity5 and the @entity6 and @entity2 governments			1
the race , which had been supposed to be held in the second round of the season , had been in doubt following a travel warning by the @entity6 government			1
the directive warned against drivers or teams sponsored by @entity5 making the trip and although this was withdrawn on november 20 , the timing meant that the race had to be canceled			2
@entity20 wraps up @entity1 title @entity22 , commercial rights holder of the @entity24 , said in a statement : " the @entity26 , which was set to take place at the @entity29 circuit early next year , has not been included in the 2013 calendar			2
" on june 20th 2012 , the @entity6 government recommended that teams and riders sponsored by @entity5 should not travel to the @entity2 due to safety reasons			1
therefore , the celebration of the 2013 @entity35 remained under suspension until such recommendation would be kept in force			0
" the deadline for @entity22 , commercial rights holder of the @entity24 , to officially propose the @entity40 to @entity41 was november 18th			0
" on november 20th , the @entity6 government notified through email sent to @entity22 the withdrawal of the above - referred recommendation , when the time for the calendar presentation had already expired and therefore , there was no possibility to include a new @entity1 ™ event			1
" anyhow , @entity22 commits itself to include @entity35 on the @entity50 and onwards , to be approved by @entity41 subject to the homologation of the track , which presumably shall take place within the first quarter of 2013			0
" @entity22 recognizes the @entity55 ´ s efforts regarding the satisfactorily termination of the construction works and the organization and promotion preliminary activities			0

next year 's @entity63 canceled
row between oil firm @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity2 governments put *pay* to race
travel warning by @entity6 government withdrawn too late
@entity1 should return to @entity29 in 2014
