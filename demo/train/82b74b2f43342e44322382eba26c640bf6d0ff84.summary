@entity1 , @entity0 of the @entity6 , motor sport 's governing body , has fined @entity7 -- the team at the center of the " spygate " scandal -- $ 100m and stripped it of its constructors ' championship points for the season			1
and @entity7 faces further penalties when the @entity5 reconvenes in december 2007			1
@entity7 must submit a full technical report on its 2008 car			1
if the @entity5 considers that its design was influenced by confidential @entity19 data , then sanctions may be imposed on the team for the 2008 season			2
@entity7 team chief @entity22 arrives for the hearing in @entity24			1
in an official press statement , the @entity6 stated : " the @entity5 has stripped @entity7 of all constructor points in the 2007 @entity27 and the team can score no points for the remainder of the season			1
" furthermore , the team will pay a fine equal to $ 100m , less the @entity34 [ @entity34 ] income lost as a result of the points deduction			1
" however , due to the exceptional circumstances in which the @entity6 gave the team 's drivers an immunity in return for providing evidence , there is no penalty in regard to drivers ' points			1
" should @entity7 's drivers , @entity49 and @entity50 , win in any of the remaining races of the 2007 season no representatives of @entity7 will be allowed on the podium			1
the @entity5 is expected to announce the reasons for its decisions on september 14			2
in july the @entity5 ruled that @entity7 was in breach of @entity57 of the @entity58 but recommended that no punitive measures were taken until a hearing of the @entity6 's @entity61 on september 13			1
however , in the light of new evidence -- the source and nature of which remain undisclosed -- the @entity5 is to reconvene in place of the @entity69 hearing			2
the murky story began in june of this year , when @entity19 sacked its performance director @entity71 and initiated court proceedings against him in @entity73 , @entity74			2
it then emerged that a 780 - page document containing confidential technical data about @entity19 's @entity79 car had been found in the possession of @entity7 's chief designer @entity81			1
@entity81 's wife , @entity82 , had taken the document for duplication at a copy shop near @entity7 's @entity86 headquarters			1
an employee of the copy shop , suspicious that confidential data was being copied , blew the whistle to @entity19			2
@entity19 suspected the source of the leak was @entity71 , a friend and former colleague of @entity81 's ( the pair had worked together at @entity94 in the late 1980s )			0
@entity71 had been the team 's chief mechanic , but in february took his new role as the team 's performance director -- which did not require him to attend grands prix -- when he expressed his disquiet at the @entity19 's reorganization following the departure of technical director @entity103			0
@entity19 filed a formal complaint against @entity71 in @entity73 , @entity74 where the district attorney initiated a criminal investigation			0
@entity19 issued the following press statement : " @entity19 announces it has recently presented a case against @entity71 and an engineer from the @entity7 team with the @entity111 , concerning the theft of technical information			1
furthermore , legal action has been instigated in @entity0 and a search warrant has been issued concerning the engineer			0
this produced a positive outcome			0
" @entity7 promptly dismissed @entity81 , its chief designer			1
it then emerged that @entity81 and @entity71 had met with @entity79 boss , @entity119 , in june this year to discuss employment possibilities			0
however @entity79 were cleared of any wrongdoing by the @entity6 who were satisfied that no confidential material had been offered to or received by @entity79			1
@entity81 and his wife appeared in the @entity125 in @entity1 for a preliminary hearing on july 10			0
@entity19 dropped the case in consideration of the @entity81 's full disclosure and promise of future cooperation			0
the furore seemed to cool down after the @entity5 's verdict			0
@entity19 remained unhappy that @entity7 had emerged from the scandal without penalty but the @entity5 did not have sufficient evidence to enforce such a penalty			1
but now the @entity6 is in possession of new evidence			2
rumors have centered on emails between @entity7 test driver @entity142 and reigning world champion @entity49			1
on august 31 @entity144 the @entity6 president wrote letters to all three @entity146 , @entity49 and @entity50 -- in which he stated : " the @entity6 has subsequently been made aware of an allegation that one or more @entity7 drivers may be in possession , or that such drivers have recently been in possession , of written evidence relevant to this investigation			1
" the letter continued : " i can confirm , given the importance of this issue , that any information you may make available in response to this letter will not result in any proceedings against you under the @entity58 or the @entity34 regulations			0
however , in the event that it later comes to light that you have withheld any potentially relevant information , serious consequences could follow			0
" five days later the @entity5 announced it was to reconvene " following the emergence of new evidence " , in place of the @entity69 hearing			0
other rumors had emerged regarding a mysterious white powder said to have been found on the fuel caps of the @entity174 of @entity175 and @entity176 in practice leading up to the @entity178			0
@entity71 has denied involvement in these sabotage claims or in the espionage case in general			0
further drama overshadowed @entity49 and @entity184 's one - two on the podium at the @entity74 @entity178 on sunday			0
@entity73 's public prosecutor , @entity186 , issued a legal notice -- known as an ' avviso di garanzia ' -- that six @entity7 employees were under criminal investigation			2
the six included @entity7 supremo @entity22 , managing directors @entity191 and @entity193 , technical director @entity193 and designer @entity195 as well as @entity81			2
this outcome has put a dark shadow @entity7 's return to winning ways			2
the team , dominant in the late 1990s , had struggled with reliability for some years			0
but the team is not taking the decision lying down			0
@entity191 , coo of the @entity204 said : " we believe we have got the grounds for an appeal , but of course we are going to wait for the findings of the @entity6			1
" e-mail to a friend			0
