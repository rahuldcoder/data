-- @entity1 said tuesday that it is liable for the @entity3 , @entity4 , pipeline rupture , which killed eight people and destroyed dozens of homes in september 2010 , and will compensate the victims			1
" we are taking on financial responsibility so that everyone injured in the accident will be able to recover all of their damages from @entity1 , " said @entity9 , the company 's president			1
" we are affirming our commitment to do the right thing in our response to this accident			1
" the announcement came in response to a @entity25 judge 's request for @entity1 's official position and ahead of a court hearing friday on the case , @entity1 said on its website			1
@entity1 said it has been working to resolve claims " fairly and promptly " and to improve the safety of its pipeline operations			1
federal officials said in august that a faulty pipe , flawed operations and inadequate government oversight led to the natural gas explosion in the @entity39 suburb			0
during a public board meeting after delivering their final report on the matter , @entity41 investigators sharply criticized pipeline owner @entity1 for the explosion , saying the pipe was inadequate from the time it was installed in 1956			1
that was compounded " by a litany of failures " over the years , including poor record - keeping , inadequate inspection programs and " an integrity management program without integrity , " @entity41 chairwoman @entity49 said			0
" it was not a question of if this pipeline would burst , " she said			2
" it was a question of when			0
" @entity49 said the probe yielded " troubling revelations about a company that exploited weaknesses in a lax system of oversight , and government agencies that placed a blind trust in operators to the detriment of public safety			0
" in a memo sent tuesday to employees , @entity9 noted that a legal filing in july had been interpreted by some to mean that the utility " was leaving the door open to somehow blame @entity3 residents or the city of @entity3 for the accident itself			1
nothing could be further from the truth , which we stated at the time			0
in a follow - up filing , we clarified our position by explicitly stating that none of the plaintiffs or residents of @entity3 was at fault for the accident			1
@entity1 has consistently stated our position that we would do what we could to assist the residents of @entity3 and help them recover from this tragic accident			1
" he said external pressure had not led the company to issue the announcement			0
" the judge is hopeful that this will make the legal proceedings move faster and more efficiently			0
@entity1 is hopeful that this will allow the people injured to receive compensation sooner without unnecessary legal proceedings			1
" the september 9 , 2010 , explosion blasted a 72 - foot by 26 - foot crater and destroyed 38 homes in @entity3 , near @entity108			1
a 28 - foot segment of the pipe was found about 100 feet from the crater			0
scorched homes and the shells of burned - out cars lined charred streets , where firefighters battled hot spots trying to save the devastated neighborhood			2
prior to the hearing , the company said in a statement that it had taken " multiple steps " to improve the safety of its operations , including efforts to replace aging pipe and improve contacts with local police and fire departments			0
@entity41 investigators determined the explosion was caused by a substandard and poorly welded pipe , creating a weak spot that resulted in a pipeline rupture during a pressure increase stemming from poorly planned electrical work			2
they said the faulty welds should have been detected when the pipe was laid in 1956			0
compounding the problem , investigators said , was the fact that @entity1 failed to alert emergency responders as soon as they realized the line had burst			2
isolating the rupture to stop the flow of gas took more than an hour , and put first responders in a defensive mode as they struggled to put out the fire , investigators said			0
" there were a lot of opportunities missed here by @entity1 , " @entity49 said			2
during the board meeting , board member @entity155 noted that the @entity157 failed to exercise adequate oversight and enforcement of @entity1 , and that the federal regulator , the @entity160 , which is a part of the @entity162 , failed to monitor the state commission 's oversight of @entity1			2
" this accident is not just about the failure of a seam in a pipeline			0
rather it 's about a failure of an entire system -- a system of checks and balances that should have been put in place to prevent the disaster , " @entity155 said			0
board members pointed to previous @entity1 - related incidents as examples of the company 's lax procedures , noting a gas explosion resulting in a fatality in 2008 , and a gas main break in 1981 that forced more than 30,000 people to evacuate @entity39 's financial district			2
@entity1 runs three major gas pipelines , including the one involved in the @entity3 explosion , under " nine high - population - density neighborhoods in @entity39 , " @entity190 said .			1

new : @entity1 president stresses that city of @entity3 nor residents were at fault
" we are affirming our commitment to do the right thing , " @entity9 says
eight died and dozens of homes were destroyed when pipeline ruptured in 2010
