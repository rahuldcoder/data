-- when training camps for big - time college football teams open in august , behemoth linemen and other players will get their first taste of new rules regarding how much food @entity8 schools can provide their athletes			1
in short , as much as they want			0
that 's assuming a proposal that came out of the @entity15 legislative council this week gets approved , as expected , by the @entity8 board of directors			1
it 's a small change in benefits -- as of last season , athletes could receive three meals a day -- but not a sea change that could lead to players getting paid			1
many athletes in the revenue sports think they should get a piece of the pie			2
right now , executives get paid , coaches get paid , the referees get paid , the announcers get paid , the people who sell souvenir merchandise get paid -- but the players do n't			1
many athletes get a one - year scholarship ( almost always renewed during all four years of eligibility ) that covers tuition , books , room and board and related fees			1
other football and basketball players walk on and receive nothing			1
next year , they will be included in the unlimited meals , the @entity15 says			1
but no pay for play , no salary for the at least 20 hours of work per week during the season			0
that 's something many football and basketball players want to see change			2
@entity59 basketball player @entity58 expressed as much at the @entity62 men 's basketball tournament a few weeks ago , when he made controversial comments about going to bed starving			0
while many fans focused on his comment " there are hungry nights that i go to bed and i 'm starving , " he also talked about others profiting off merchandise he helped make popular			0
" when you see your jersey getting sold -- it may not have your last name on it -- but when you see your jersey getting sold and things like that , you feel like you want something in return , " he added			0
it 's that sentiment that prompted former @entity87 basketball star @entity86 to join with 20 other plaintiffs -- each of whom will file his own lawsuit -- against the @entity15 for what they claim is the unlawful use of their likenesses in video games and other media			2
the current and former players have already settled a suit with one popular video game maker			2
@entity86 's antitrust case is scheduled to begin in a federal courtroom on june 9 , according to @entity103 , which says the entire business model for major college athletics could change			2
billions are at stake , says the @entity108			0
" i 'm not going to ruin college sports			2
the rules need to change , " @entity86 has said			0
the @entity15 contends that athletes are paid in the form of a free education , something that holds a lot of value both immediately and in the future			1
athletes also get team - issued shoes and other athletic gear			0
but they are not allowed to sell them			0
throw in paid travel , free coaching and free medical aid , and many sports fans think that 's a pretty good deal			2
a poll conducted last year by @entity130 showed that about two - thirds of fans of college football and college basketball agreed that a scholarship for top players was sufficient			1
still , the number of legal challenges for the @entity15 seems to be on the rise			1
in march , the @entity141 office of the @entity142 ruled that football players at @entity144 -- a private school that fields teams in the @entity148 conference -- can unionize , deeming them school employees			1
players are set to take their union vote on april 25			0
the players at @entity144 say they want better medical coverage , concussion testing , four - year scholarships that cover the entire cost of attendance , and the possibility of being paid			1
they 're led by former quarterback @entity159 and @entity160 , founder of the @entity161 and the @entity162			0
the @entity142 ruled that @entity144 football players should be considered employees because of the hours they put in , the control the university has over them and the revenue they generate			1
@entity144 is appealing the ruling to the national @entity142 , maintaining that players are not university employees but " students , first and foremost			1
" @entity15 president @entity172 has called the idea of unionized collegiate sports teams " grossly inappropriate			2
" " it would blow up everything about the collegiate model of athletics , " he said			0
the labor board 's ruling only applies to @entity144 for now			1
so state lawmakers in @entity182 and @entity183 are taking steps -- albeit opposite ones -- to address the issue at public colleges in their states			0
an @entity183 measure approved recently says players " are not public employees based upon participating in athletics for the state university			0
" but in @entity182 , state rep. @entity194 and other lawmakers are considering legislation that would allow athletes at the @entity59 to unionize , @entity194 said after @entity58 made his " no money for food " comments			2
" he says he 's going to bed hungry at a time when millions of dollars are being made off of him			0
it 's obscene , " @entity194 said			0
" this is n't a @entity182 problem			0
this is an @entity15 problem , and i want to make sure we 're putting pressure on them to treat athletes well			1
" there is one other important legal matter that cuts right to the heart of the decades - old question whether college athletes should be paid or receive a stipend			1
four college athletes , represented by attorney @entity219 , filed a class - action lawsuit in march -- just as the @entity15 basketball tournament was set to begin -- against the @entity15 accusing it of " illegally restraining competition for the services of players			1
" in layman 's terms , the lawsuit argues college athletes should be paid and aims to end the old notion of amateurism in college sports			1
it would give a university the option of paying the players it wants most			0
it also calls for individual damages for the player plaintiffs			0
@entity219 represents @entity240 football player @entity239 ; @entity242 basketball player @entity241 ; @entity244 football player @entity243 , who played his senior season in 2013 ; and @entity247 football player @entity246 , who also played basketball for the @entity249 in 2011 and 2012			0
while only four plaintiffs are named , the class - action suit proposes representing all @entity8 players and all @entity8 basketball players			1
in addition to the @entity15 , the lawsuit -- which the @entity161 is backing -- also targets the so - called " power conferences " : the @entity257 , @entity148 , @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260			2
" what we are saying is that it is fundamentally unfair for there to be rules that prevent athletes who create all of this " from being paid , said @entity219 , who has experience in suing sports leagues			2
@entity0 's @entity269 and @entity270 contributed to this report .			0
