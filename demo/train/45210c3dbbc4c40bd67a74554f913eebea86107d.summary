@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 got his liver from an executed @entity1 prisoner ; @entity7 in @entity6 bought a kidney for his sister for $ 5,300 ; in @entity10 is holding out for $ 30,700 for one of his kidneys			1
doctors in @entity14 have been arrested for abducting people , drugging them and stealing their kidneys			1
they are not so unusual : a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with end - stage illnesses to poorer places like @entity1 , @entity14 , @entity23 , @entity6 , @entity24 and the @entity25 to buy a new lease of life			1
@entity3 , a 53 - year - old chief subway technician in @entity0 , was diagnosed with liver cancer in january 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread			1
a friend told him about a transplant hospital in @entity1 's north eastern @entity35 city and he signed up for a place			1
that april , he paid 260,000 yuan ( $ 34,380 ) for a transplant -- surgery that saved his life			1
" the hospital has connections with a lot of prisons , " @entity3 told @entity2			0
" @entity44 came from an executed prisoner from @entity46			0
i thank the donor deeply			0
" the @entity48 estimates that 21,000 liver transplants are carried out annually , but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90,000			0
demand for kidneys also exceeds supply , and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and " transplant tourists " who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living			1
a donor in @entity68 receives $ 700 for a kidney compared with $ 30,000 in the @entity70			1
a lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on , or at least regulate , the trade			1
but even where the trade is banned , laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes , which are sometimes defended by vested interests			1
and the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient			0
any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor -- especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donor 's liver			2
the complications can include bleeding , infection , even death			0
in the transplant trade , the recipient need not worry about , for example , exposing a living relative to that risk			1
" it is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you do n't have to care for someone you do n't know			0
once you pay , it is discarded in a way , it is dispensable , " said @entity107 , a @entity108 - based coordinator for @entity109 at the @entity48			2
@entity1 recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners , saying it must first meet demand at home for 2 million organs a year			1
only 20,000 transplants are carried out in @entity1 each year			0
of these , 3,000 are liver transplants and 95 percent of them use livers from dead donors			2
@entity1 defended its use of organs from executed prisoners , saying consent was obtained from convicts or their families			2
a transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around $ 33,000 in @entity1			1
" what is important is the transparency , it has to be open to scrutiny ... if @entity1 makes its current system open to scrutiny and very transparent , that would do good , " said the @entity48 's @entity107			0
in @entity141 , a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs			2
excluding @entity1 , @entity141 has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year , said @entity147 - man , professor of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the @entity149			0
@entity14 , where trade in human organs is not illegal , is turning into a " kidney bazaar " , said the chief executive of @entity14 's @entity154 , @entity155			1
there are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys but @entity155 said there were 13 centers in @entity164 alone which reported more than 2,000 transplants last year from bought kidneys			0
patients , mostly from @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 , pay about 500,000 rupees ( $ 8,500 ) for a new kidney , he said			1
donors are paid $ 300 to $ 1,000 and often get no medical care after the surgery			1
there is no consent in some cases			0
in may police arrested nine people , four of them doctors , for abducting people , drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations			2
in the pipeline is a draft law aimed at banning the trade , but a powerful lobby bent on preserving it is trying to ensure it allows kidney donations for a non-relative , with no payment			1
such a clause allowing " altruistic " organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors , @entity155 said			1
stories of people selling their organs , especially kidneys , are not uncommon in @entity6 , where more than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line			2
@entity7 , who asked to be identified only by his first name because organ trading is illegal , said it took him only 15 days to secure a kidney for his sister who was suffering from kidney failure			1
he said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30,000 @entity6 pounds ( $ 5,300 )			1
" the fees of the doctor were 5,000 pounds			0
both his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money the ' donor ' received , " said @entity7			0
he said doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients ' lists			1
@entity225 , head of the disciplinary committee at the @entity227 , said @entity6 law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants , making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence			0
" the law says it is illegal to trade in organs but does not specify the punishment			1
we at the union suspended many doctors and closed their practices , but they have appealed before courts and won their licenses back , " he told @entity2			0
" it is an annoying and a regrettable situation			0
well - known doctors and professors are doing this			0
they are rich people but they do it because they have no moral values			2
" the union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants , with a draft bill including heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved and a ban on transplants between people of different nationalities			2
but the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years because of differences between doctors and senior muslim religious leaders on whether @entity266 allows organ transplants in the case of clinical deaths			2
in @entity23 , students , unemployed young men and struggling fathers post adverts on the @entity274 selling their kidneys , listing their drinking and smoking habits and blood type			0
these would - be donors say they have had enquiries from @entity281 , @entity282 and @entity23 with asking prices going up to 50,000 lira ( $ 38,760 )			1
@entity284 , a 27 - year - old security guard in @entity10 with two young children who also requested only his first name be published , told @entity2 he received five or six offers from @entity23 and @entity281 , offering 10,000 - 15,000 lira ( $ 11,600 ) , but he 's holding out for 40,000 lira			2
" of course it 's frightening but there 's nothing else to be done , " he said , adding he had n't told his wife as he knew she would object			0
" i 'm doing it because of my family , if i was alone it would n't matter			0
i 've got two children ... there 's nothing else i can do for them			0

" transplant tourists " travel to poor countries to buy organs from the desperate
@entity14 , where trade in human organs is legal , is turning into a " kidney bazaar "
patients pay $ 8,500 for a new kidney , while donors are paid just $ 300 to $ 1,000
