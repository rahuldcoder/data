-- it 's not easy being a mother , caring so much about these delicate little dumplings that hold half of your dna and keep putting themselves in danger			1
which is why it 's important to not just acknowledge the worst tv moms , but also the best			1
my personal favorite is @entity14 ( @entity15 ) from " @entity14			0
" she did n't just raise @entity16 ; she mothered the whole neighborhood of delinquent teenagers while working full - time as a nurse and dealing with a grumpy husband			1
and she managed to do all that while maintaining her sense of humor , with a little help from her dear friend @entity26			2
the @entity0 : 10 worst tv moms another fantastic mom was @entity29 ( @entity30 ) from " @entity31			1
" because no matter how broody her daughter @entity32 got , she was always upbeat and supportive			2
i definitely cried a bunch during the @entity36 episode when she 's excited to give out candy with her daughter , but @entity32 ditches her for @entity39 and @entity40			1
not that anyone can blame her			0
all the parents on " @entity43 " are pretty great , but i love @entity44 ( @entity45 ) because she 's raised the most precocious little boy , @entity46			2
and she honestly loves @entity47 way more than his last wife @entity48 , from " @entity49			0
" she 's also terribly good - looking and tirelessly cheers on her family			1
my favorite character from " @entity53 " was @entity54 ( @entity55 ) because she said the most amazing things ever			0
and even as a 90 - year - old , she was still raising @entity58 -- even though she was younger than @entity59 in real life			2
the @entity0 : " @entity61 " rejects tv mom @entity62 and 7 other celebs sure , @entity64 sometimes forgot about @entity66 's existence and @entity67 turned out to be a brat , but you ca n't argue that she did a good job with @entity71 ! and since " @entity73 " has been on longer than any other show , she 's been raising those un-aging kids for 21 seasons			1
and on top of that , @entity76 is a bigger baby than any of the kids			0
but @entity64 still gets up every morning , does her fro , and loves the hell out of her family			0
if @entity88 's mom was one of the worst tv moms , then @entity86 's mom , @entity82 ( @entity83 ) , from " @entity84 " was one of the best			1
her daughter was one of the emo - est teenagers ever and with a bad boy boyfriend like @entity93 , she should have been pulling out her hair			1
but she managed to be a working mom and give @entity86 the space to be independent and make some mistakes			2
when things got dangerous , she stepped in and came to the rescue			0
" @entity106 " was an enviable home environment and @entity101 ( @entity102 ) managed to have a successful career as an attorney while raising five kids			0
she was such a beautiful , confident woman and she doled out the lessons like no other			0
plus , she was always dancing and wearing really amazing ' 80s fashions			0
the @entity0 : 10 worst boyfriends and husbands of 2009 i secretly loved " the @entity113 " and @entity115 's mom , @entity116 ( @entity117 ) , was so sweet			1
she reminds me of my mom , always trying to be @entity115 's best friend and getting super emotional when @entity115 went away on trips			1
she did often mess up @entity115 's life when attempting to solve her problems , but @entity115 and @entity116 had one of the most tender mother - daughter relationships ever			1
@entity126 ( @entity126 ) from " @entity127 " was similar to @entity128 from " @entity14 , " but much less of a lush			0
she was the only one allowed to call @entity130 his real name , " @entity132 , " and she was always doting on her grumpy husband , @entity133			0
she also raised two pretty good kids and was a fantastic cook			2
the @entity0 : six celebs with reality shows in the works one of the best mother - daughter - friend relationships is between @entity140 and @entity141 ( @entity142 ) on " @entity143			1
" she had a rough start -- what with the getting pregnant before graduating from high school , while out of wedlock , and with estranged parents -- but she gave absolutely everything for her daughter			2
who does n't want to be part of their fast - talking , smart - aleck brood ? they love and respect each other			0
and enjoy witty repartee on top of that			0
