@entity0 , @entity1 -- the world 's population hits 7 billion this week , but @entity5 , the patriarch of what may be the biggest family in the world , is not bothered			1
" i do n't care about overpopulation in @entity1 ... i believe @entity12 has chosen us to be like this ( have big families )			1
those who are born into this family do n't want to leave this tradition so we just keep growing and growing , " he says with a smile			2
@entity5 , who only goes by his first name , has 39 wives , 86 children and 35 grandchildren			1
@entity5 's father , @entity25 , founded the @entity27 sect in @entity29 village that promotes polygamy as @entity12 's will			1
" i never wanted to get married but that 's the path @entity12 has chosen for me , " he says			1
" it 's not my wish to keep marrying again and again			2
" all 160 family members live in a four - storey mansion perched on top of a remote village in the northeastern @entity1 state of @entity0			1
the state , neighboring @entity41 and @entity42 , has one million residents , one of the lowest population densities in this country of 1.2 billion			0
despite its natural beauty , special permits are required to enter the state , making tourism virtually non-existent			0
four hours away from @entity0 's only airport , in the isolated village of @entity29 , @entity5 's bright purple house with 22 bedrooms stands out			1
the main room is a giant hall where the family cooks , eats and prays			2
the bedrooms are dormitory - style with an average of 20 beds , each double bed about a foot apart from the next			0
the children sleep with their mothers who take turns visiting the 69 year - old 's master bedroom			2
" there is no discrimination amongst us , he treats us all equally , " fifth wife @entity68 says			0
@entity5 first got married when he was 17 to @entity73 , who is now 70			1
his youngest wife is 31			0
as the eldest wife , @entity73 calls all the shots in the kitchen so meal times are an efficient exercise			0
without much fuss , while some women of the house cook , others set the table , still others serve and clean			0
" we cook 25 kilograms of rice , 40 kilograms of potatoes and 5 kilograms of lentils everyday , " @entity68 says			0
the family indulges in meat three times a week and for every non-vegetarian meal , 30 chickens are plucked and a giant pig is roasted			2
but the sheer volume of food that needs to be cooked or plates that need to be washed does n't overwhelm the women of the house			0
like a well - oiled machine , everyone carries out their individual chore , so dinner for 160 is ready within an hour and utensils are washed and put away within minutes			2
even the children help out			0
tiny 6 - year - olds have become experts at plucking chickens , and everyone seems to get along			0
" no fighting , never , we are all one family , there 's no other people here so we do n't fight , " says sixth grandson @entity111 , one of the few in the household who speaks @entity115			2
" since we are used to living in a very big family when we go outside to study we actually feel very lonely , " he says laughing			0
but while he likes living in a big family , he himself does n't want more than one wife			0
" my grandfather is specially appointed by @entity12 to have as many wives as possible and to look after them			1
but for me , having one wife and one son is quite enough			0
there is no rule or tradition as such that we have to follow polygamy , for me it 's actually unbearable , " @entity128 says			2
@entity128 says his great grandfather @entity25 , who also had multiple wives , had a spiritual revelation after he was expelled from the @entity137 for his unusual lifestyle			1
so @entity25 created his own polygamist sect , which now has a following of 400 families			1
@entity5 is the caretaker of the self - reliant sect			1
they grow their own crops and raise their own livestock			0
" everyone has a designated job			0
some are doing carpentry work , some take care of the piggery and poultry farm and others cultivate crops , " @entity5 says			2
he has set up a school nearby for children of the community , the curriculum comes from the government but @entity5 has added some sect - specific teachings			1
" my father is the greatest god that we can have in this world , he has done so much for us , " says his eldest son @entity165 , who has two wives and 14 children			1
@entity1 is set to overtake @entity173 as the world 's most populous nation by 2030			1
but crowding and crumbling infrastructure in @entity1 's booming cities do n't faze @entity5			1
" i 'm not troubled by the noise or the overcrowding			0
my mind remains at peace , " he says			0
the family is not listed in the @entity183 because @entity5 says he does n't want the publicity			1
but as word gets out , @entity29 village and @entity5 's family may not remain so isolated .			1

one man in @entity1 is the patriarch of a family of 160 in rural @entity1
@entity5 , who only goes by his first name , has 39 wives , 86 children and 35 grandchildren .
@entity5 's father , @entity25 , founded the @entity27 sect in @entity29 that promotes polygamy
" i never wanted to get married but that 's the path @entity12 has chosen for me "
