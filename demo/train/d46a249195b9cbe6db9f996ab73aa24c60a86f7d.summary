@entity0 -- @entity2 threw open the doors friday to its archive of more than a quarter million secret @entity6 diplomatic cables , unfiltered and unedited , exposing and possibly endangering confidential diplomatic sources			1
the website made the controversial decision after losing control of the documents in a series of blunders			2
@entity2 supporters posted the entire encrypted archive on the internet late last year			1
separately , @entity17 , the investigative editor of the @entity19 newspaper , formerly one of @entity2 media partners , published the password to unlock the archive in his book " inside @entity2 : @entity24 's @entity25 "			1
together , both pieces of information , unlocked the full trove of @entity6 diplomatic cables , accessible to anyone on the web			2
but @entity2 ' decision to open its archive is likely to bring the cables to a much wider audience -- and has already sparked criticism that it will put people at risk			1
a brief search through the cables shows that documents have not been redacted in any way			0
the names and other details of confidential diplomatic sources are on full display , despite being labelled with the instruction " strictly protect " , including cables classified as " secret " or " confidential			1
" the @entity19 , the @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , four of @entity2 ' former media partners , condemned the release			2
in a joint statement they said : " we deplore the decision of @entity2 to publish the unredacted @entity57 cables , which may put sources at risk			1
" our previous dealings with @entity2 were on the clear basis that we would only publish cables which had been subjected to a thorough editing and clearance process			0
" we will continue to defend our collaborative publishing endeavour			0
we can not defend the needless publication of the complete data -- indeed , we are united in condemning it			0
today 's decision to publish by @entity24 was his , and his alone			0
" @entity70 announced late thursday it was suspending a @entity2 " mirror site " because of concerns over potential risks to sources			1
in an editorial , it wrote that on launching the mirror site late last year , @entity70 " said it defended ' the free flow of information online and the principle of the protection of sources , without which investigative journalism can not exist			1
' " as the protection of sources is now in question , @entity70 has decided to suspend the site pending further clarification			1
" @entity2 posted friday on @entity86 : " shining a light on 45 years of @entity6 ' diplomacy ' , it is time to open the archives forever			1
" the organization also gave full instructions on how to download all 251,287 cables			0
@entity2 appealed for members of the public to " crowdsource " the cables and publish their findings on @entity86 under the hashtag # wlfind			0
crowdsourcing is the act of outsourcing tasks to an undefined , large group through an public call -- in this case to publish parts of the cables			0
the reason , according to a statement posted by @entity2 on @entity86 : " the entire world press does not have enough resources and there are substantial biases			0
" @entity57 spokeswoman @entity113 told @entity1 thursday : " @entity2 did advise us of the impending release of information and of its intention to continue to release classified documents			2
" we have made clear our views and concerns about illegally disclosed classified information and the continuing risk to individuals and national security that such releases cause			0
" @entity2 has , however , ignored our requests not to release or disseminate any @entity6 documents it may possess and has continued its well - established pattern of irresponsible , reckless , and frankly dangerous actions			2
we are not cooperating with them			0

new : @entity70 suspends a @entity2 " mirror site " over concerns
the documents first became accessible online after @entity2 lost control of them
@entity2 has now thrown open the full , unredacted archive itself
newspapers condemn the move , saying confidential sources may be put at risk
