-- president @entity1 authorized the killing of an @entity4 citizen because he had declared war on the @entity4 and encouraged others to bring harm to @entity4			1
whatever @entity10 's wrongs -- and there were many -- when @entity4 kills its own without a trial , it not only demeans itself but it hands over a propaganda victory to its enemies			1
@entity15 , @entity16 's leader since the death of @entity18 , will chide this great country again for abandoning its values and principles			2
the @entity23 's authorization of this killing also tells @entity25 that a precedent has been set by their government to kill @entity4 citizens abroad without trial if they oppose their country			1
this can not be right -- and is counterproductive to defeating terrorism in the long term because it demolishes the very values that @entity4 stands for : the rule of law and trial by jury			1
it is abandoning these very same principles of human dignity , underpinned by free and fair trials that led to @entity10 's decisive shift after being released from a @entity44 prison in 2007 : from being anti-american rabble - rouser , he went to advocating direct violence against the @entity4			1
prison experiences in the @entity50 world -- being arrested and detained without legal representation and exposed to the worst forms of torture at the hands of fellow @entity55 -- change nonviolent extremists to violent extremists			0
@entity59 's transformation from extremism to violence comes in this context			1
his alleged links to 9/11 terrorists were not as significant as some argue			0
if he was known to be involved in the 9/11 attacks , why was he a guest of the @entity68 , of all places , in 2002 ? @entity59 is not alone			2
before him , @entity15 was tortured in @entity71 prisons , and during his trial in 1982 , he addressed a gallery of @entity75 journalists in @entity76 and declared , " so where is democracy ? where is freedom ? where is human rights ? where is justice ? we will never forget ! " without a doubt , @entity10 and @entity15 were already radicalized before prison , but the tipping point toward violence came with their prison experiences			1
and before @entity15 , the intellectual framework for @entity16 's destructive worldview was put in place by @entity94 in @entity95 in prison in @entity96 's @entity71			0
again , it was torture and the absence of humane treatment that led to @entity94 declaring war on the @entity71 government			0
@entity94 's prison writings have inspired every jihadist movement around the globe			0
this same movement sees @entity10 as a lightweight , not least because he never set foot on the battlefield and his scholarly credentials are open to question			2
in @entity71 or @entity110 , @entity10 is not well - known			2
little wonder , then , that @entity111 is not as excited by @entity10 's killing as western media outlets			1
@entity59 was important among @entity55 in the @entity115 -- from @entity44 , he used the @entity116 to reach this constituency			0
but even before the launch of his blog in 2008 , @entity10 was popular among @entity55 in @entity76 , @entity120 and @entity4 because of his audiotapes about the history of early @entity55 personalities			1
these tapes were , and many still are , in circulation in mosques and bookshops			0
@entity59 could have been discredited before his prison experiences or , now , his perceived martyrdom			2
by killing @entity10 , his message gains new life as words from an @entity4 @entity55 martyr , the first to join the iconography of underground @entity55 culture since @entity137 an easier , cheaper and more effective way of discrediting @entity10 and countering his message would have been to disclose his three arrests for the solicitation of prostitutes in @entity142 and the @entity144 , area between 1996 and 1997			1
he had even pleaded guilty to the 1997 charge , and was subsequently sentenced to three years ' probation and a fine			0
among his socially conservative @entity55 following in @entity150 and @entity4 , immediately after 9/11 , such information would have been dynamite			0
the @entity4 can not kill its way out of terrorism			1
just as with the @entity154 , the challenge from @entity156 extremism and jihadist violence urgently needs a cultural , intellectual and informational response			0
violence breeds more violence and , in this case , literally creates martyrs out of @entity16 's murderers			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			0

@entity166 : killing @entity10 demolishes the values that @entity4 stands for
the killing also gives a propaganda victory to @entity4 's enemies , he says
@entity166 : @entity59 could have been discredited before he radicalized
the @entity4 can not kill its way out of terrorism , @entity166 says
