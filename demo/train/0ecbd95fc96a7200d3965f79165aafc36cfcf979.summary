@entity0 , @entity1 -- as @entity3 churns through the @entity4 , several response vessels at the site of @entity11 's ruptured well are in the process of being moved out of harm 's way friday , possibly leaving the sealed well cap unattended for about 48 hours , federal officials said			2
" the intention right now is to put the vessels in a safe place so they can return as quickly as possible , " retired @entity13 adm. @entity12 said			1
the rigs drilling the relief wells and the @entity20 recovery vessel are expected to be fully disconnected by late friday afternoon , @entity12 said in a briefing friday			1
operators manning the vessels will begin to move to a position of the " best survivability , " he added			0
even if the vessels monitoring the well have to depart , @entity12 said , they 'll perform aerial and satellite surveillance and leave recording equipment at the base of the well to continue observation			1
" if we have to evacuate the scene , we 're probably looking at a very limited window , probably 48 hours , " he said			0
@entity12 also addressed the " good and bad part " of a tropical storm hitting the @entity4 region : while he acknowledged how a storm surge could drive the oil into beach and marsh areas , where it would have not been driven otherwise , @entity12 says the increased weather activity may " actually help " disperse the oil			1
" so we 're mindful that those are two consequences and prepared to move out and aggressively attack this once the threat is passed through			0
but in [ the ] meantime , preservation of life and preservation of equipment are our highest priority , " @entity12 said			1
later , @entity12 told @entity2 's @entity55 , " it 's certainly going to be a setback " in the effort to permanently seal the well and clean up the @entity4			1
he noted that 800 skimmers that had been collecting oil on the surface across the @entity63 will be returning to safety on shore but said authorities are slowly making progress			1
" i 'm not ready to declare victory , nor should anybody			0
but we certainly are starting to gain a bit of an upper hand here , " he said			1
" of course , we still have beach cleanup and marshland areas that are affected			0
" @entity11 said that pressure in the well continues to " slowly increase			0
" @entity79 officials said they will continue to take pressure readings and monitor the well as long as weather permits			0
on thursday , officials said the departure of the relief well rig could delay work on the operation -- described as the permanent fix to the ruptured well -- for at least 10 days			2
@entity12 said the cap placed over the damaged well in the @entity4 will remain sealed and continue to stop oil from escaping even if the more than 2,000 people who have been working at the well site are off the water			1
the weather could force officials to temporarily scale back efforts to search beneath the surface for leaking oil			2
but @entity12 said thursday that the remote vehicles used to monitor the area will be the last to leave and the first to return			1
sensors and extensive monitoring have allowed observers to " rule out any indications that there might be a leak , " @entity12 said thursday , noting that his confidence in the integrity of the well had " improved dramatically " after he examined data over the past few days			2
once the weather system passes , a plan to pump mud into the well to force oil back into the reservoir below is in the works			2
@entity11 has @entity12 's approval to prepare for the " static kill " process but would still need the government 's final go - ahead before proceeding , @entity11 senior vice president @entity115 said			2
meanwhile , officials monitoring the spill say they continue to track the tropical weather and communicate with the @entity124 , which is ultimately responsible for the safety of the more than 40,000 people assisting in recovery and response efforts in the @entity129			0
" the protection of the equipment and crew is paramount to ensure maximum ability to respond to any new challenges a storm may pose to the enormous mission , " rear adm. @entity130 , the federal on - scene coordinator , said in a news release thursday			2
" we are repositioning assets away from low - lying areas to higher - ground staging areas to protect our ability to respond to the dynamic requirements of the incident , " @entity130 said			0
at 5 p.m. et friday , @entity147 had been downgraded to a tropical depression after moving across southern @entity149			0
it was moving west - northwest at 18 miles an hour and had maximum sustained winds of 35 miles an hour			0
it 's expected to make landfall early sunday between @entity0 , @entity1 , and southeastern @entity154			0
if the storm continues on its path , it could slam into the area of the @entity11 oil spill and possibly push more oil to shore			0
the tropical weather system could diminish or erase encouraging signs of recovery from the @entity11 oil spill , according to a scientist who spearheaded the first major examination of the @entity1 coast wetlands			0
" early marsh regrowth could easily be taken away with high winds and waves , " said @entity168 , a @entity169 oceanography professor who has spent his career researching marshes			0
meanwhile , at a federal hearing in @entity0 , @entity1 , on friday , a @entity176 chief engineering technician testified that the rig 's general alarm system -- which is designed to detect a sudden rise in natural gas -- had been disabled because rig managers " did not want people woke up at 3 in the morning due to false alarms			1
" technician @entity185 said the alarm system had been been " inhibited " for about a year before the april 20 explosion that killed 11 workers and started the worst oil disaster in the nation 's history			1
@entity185 said supervisors on the @entity194 rig were aware that the system had been inhibited			1
@entity194 later said in a statement that the disabling was " intentional and conforms to accepted maritime practices			1
" " it was not a safety oversight or done as a matter of convenience , " it said			0
the company said there were hundreds of individual fire and gas alarms on the @entity176 in a " zone - based " system			2
the rig had an option -- which was resorted to -- to prevent the general alarm from sounding when an individual alarm went off			1
@entity194 said it 's possible that individual alarms might be providing notification of " minor issues or a non-emergency , " and " repeated false alarms increase risk and decrease rig safety			1
" @entity2 's @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report .			0
