-- @entity2 's decision to file for public status later this year means its no. 2 executive , @entity4 , might be worth as much as $ 1.6 billion			1
according to @entity6 , that would catapult her just below the seemingly untouchable @entity8 in the ranking of the richest self - made women			2
she wo n't have much company : only 7.5 % of the major earners at @entity15 's @entity14 companies are female			1
the many media profiles of @entity4 all seem to be asking the same question : how did @entity4 do it ? how did she get the confidence to perform so well at such a high level ? and perform she has			1
according to the @entity21 , she took @entity2 from 70 million users and no business model to profits reaching $ 1 billion on $ 3.7 billion in revenue in just four years			1
@entity4 's own mentor , @entity27 , ignited a firestorm in 2005 when he wondered publicly whether one reason women were n't achieving at the highest levels in the sciences was a lack of biological aptitude , particularly for math. before long , he was ousted from his position as president of @entity38 -- not officially for this reason -- and the nation was abuzz about women 's lack of parity in so many fields and forums			1

the opinion page became a particularly contentious space for an outpouring of women 's voices in this overdue conversation			1
nationally syndicated columnist @entity58 called the @entity60 ' leadership out for sexism on its opinion pages			0
@entity63 of the @entity64 argued with @entity58 and said she resented being called a " female " journalist			2
and @entity66 of the @entity21 , echoing one of the most commonly held beliefs about why women do n't have parity , wrote that women were n't fairly represented because they are afraid of being attacked and care too much about what others think			0
but what does that really mean ? the notion that women lack confidence implies a negative judgment			1
it 's viewed as a weakness , coded as feminine			0
but some recent social science research reveals a more likely and complex explanation : people do things because people who look and talk like them or share the same background do those things			0
see also : women ! embrace your inner geek to assume that a lack of confidence is the reason so few women are intellectual leaders is too simplistic			1
when a woman does n't go for a big corporate job like @entity4 's or says no when television producers call , saying she does n't have any confidence implies it 's an individual choice made in some sort of sociocultural vacuum			1
as women , in many cases , the impulse to do something out of the norm of our peer group , like write an opinion piece or ask for a promotion , has simply never occurred to us			2
if it does , we do n't act on it			0
our girlfriends are n't doing it			0
our female colleagues are n't doing it			0
why should we ? peer influence , whether you 're a teenage girl trying to figure out what to wear to junior high on monday morning or a midlevel manager at @entity123 , is a powerful indicator of what you think is possible for yourself			2
in " @entity127 : how @entity135 , " @entity136 writes , " the social norms set by our peers dominate our choices about what we value and what we expect in life			0
" @entity4 , who often urges women to " lean into " their careers , must know that you do n't lean in alone			1
she runs a monthly salon for women out of her home , inviting guest speakers like feminist @entity143 and trailblazing sen. @entity144			0
women of various generations gather and shape their ambitions over a meal and some conversation			0
see also : women only hotel rooms take off at @entity153 , we cultivate new voices , training minorities and women to inhabit their place as narrators of the world			2
the challenge is to shift the way we think about ourselves			0
we must see our peers and ourselves as leaders who have a right and a responsibility to weigh in on the matters of our day			0
we have to create a new ecosystem in which we see ourselves as part of the critical conversations of our age and feel equally entitled and compelled to narrate them			2
who has n't heard a parent quip , " if all of your friends were jumping off of a cliff , would you ? " there 's some profound wisdom in that old @entity181 © : if your friends are n't aiming for high - profile corporate leadership or going head - to - head on the sunday morning talk shows , you 're not likely to , either			1
we can create more @entity187 by surrounding ourselves with confident , outspoken women			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 and @entity192 .			0

writers : @entity2 's @entity4 an *anomaly* ; 7.5 % of @entity14 big earners are female
too often , they write , people *attribute* the *scarcity* of powerful women to a lack of confidence
but people look to their peers ' *behavior* to judge what they 're capable of , writers say
women need to feel entitled to power and must cultivate confident friends , they say
