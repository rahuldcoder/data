@entity0 -- @entity5 's best - known judge will be suspended for 11 years from the bench after his conviction thursday for improperly ordering wiretaps while investigating a financial corruption case , the nation 's @entity2 ruled			1
afterward , @entity10 said he " rejects " the sentence , that the court convicted him in " an unjust and predetermined manner , " and he vowed to appeal			1
in a statement late thursday , @entity10 said , " this sentence , without judicial reason nor evidence to support it , eliminates all possibility to investigate corruption and related crimes by opening spaces of impunity , and seriously contributing -- in an effort to stop one specific judge -- to reduced independence for @entity5 judges			1
" @entity10 had ordered wiretaps against suspects who were in jail and under investigation in the case , allowing authorities to listen in on their conversations with defense attorneys and others			1
their lawyers later filed a lawsuit , arguing that the wiretapping violated their constitutional right of attorney - client privilege			0
a seven - judge panel at the @entity2 convicted @entity10 , according to court documents			1
a second trial against @entity10 ended on wednesday , but judges have not yet ruled in the case			2
that case concerns his investigation of human rights abuses under the former dictatorship of @entity52 in @entity5			1
human rights groups say both cases , especially the second one , amount to a vendetta against @entity10 , who became known internationally for his investigation into human rights abuses under former @entity62 dictator @entity61			1
@entity10 , 56 , was suspended provisionally from the bench in 2010 , pending these trials			0
a third case is under investigation , but no trial has been set			0
at a three - day trial last month in the financial corruption case , @entity10 professed innocence			1
the case implicated some leading conservative politicians , among others , and there have been trials recently against defendants in the corruption scandal known as @entity78			0
@entity10 said his wiretap orders , in early 2009 , were backed by state prosecutors , who did not bring charges against @entity10			1
he testified that he ordered the wiretaps on suspicion that suspects in the case were involved in money laundering while they were in preventative prison			1
but the @entity2 judges wrote , " the central question to be resolved in this case is related to the fundamental right of defense for the suspect , against the legitimate interest of the @entity95 to pursue crimes , " the sentence said			0
" it is not possible to have a just process if the right of defense is essentially eliminated			0
" the sentence added that @entity10 's investigation had the effect of " admitting practices which now are found only in totalitarian regimes where anything is considered valid to obtain the desired information			2
" @entity10 's possible avenues for appeal include the @entity109 -- @entity5 's highest court , which rules on constitutional issues -- or to the @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114			2
@entity115 , a leader of @entity5 's main opposition @entity116 , said the party " respects " the decision of the court but finds it " troubling that @entity10 , who has fought tirelessly against drug trafficking , terrorism and corruption , " is now convicted			2
human rights groups consider the second case against @entity10 , for his investigation of mass graves under @entity52 's rule , to be the more important one			1
in the second trial , state prosecutors again did not press charges , but a private prosecution , allowed under @entity5 law , did			1
it is led by a small civil servants union called @entity138 , or clean hands , which charged that @entity10 ignored an amnesty law approved in the @entity5 @entity141 in 1977 , two years after @entity52 's death			2
in that trial , which ended wednesday -- just hours before his conviction in the corruption investigation -- @entity10 testified that he searched but could not find any national census of how many people disappeared or their identities			2
so he decided to investigate because he considered those to be " permanent crimes " which still affect their descendants , since the remains have never been found			0
he said he began to see evidence that there was a " systematic plan " against @entity52 's opponents , which he said included forced disappearances , illegal detentions and assassinations			0
@entity52 's military uprising in 1936 triggered the three - year @entity162			2
the war ended when @entity52 's forces defeated @entity166 and leftist fighters			0
@entity52 's dictatorship continued until his death			0
mass graves from the regime are still being unearthed , said @entity171 , from a group called @entity173			0
various international observers attended the trial and @entity176 of @entity177 said on wednesday , " this is a trial that should never have been held , but which at least served to show that @entity10 acted in accordance with international law , which imposes on states a duty to investigate the worst international crimes			0
" " the @entity2 should put an end to this sorry episode for @entity5 justice by acquitting judge @entity10 of all the charges against him , " @entity176 added			1
" investigating state killings and ' disappearances ' should never be considered a crime			0
" since his suspension in 2010 , @entity10 has been working as a legal adviser outside of @entity5 on human rights cases and judicial issues , including in @entity197 .			0
