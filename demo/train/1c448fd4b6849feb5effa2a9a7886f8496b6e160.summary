" @entity4 ! " scream the children staring in awe at the glossy chestnut thoroughbred towering above them			0
their tiny hands press against the glass encasing @entity8 's most beloved race horse -- @entity9 but despite their excited squealing and impatient jostling , the impressive 1.74 - meter tall gelding will never lower his glassy stare in their direction			2
he 'll never twitch his ears , flick his tail , or gallop down the race track with the remarkable speed which made him a national hero during the darkest days of the @entity23			0
@entity9 has been dead for 81 years			0
his body however , looks barely a day over six - years - old , frozen in time thanks to taxidermy -- the art of stuffing animal skins for display			1
the champion thoroughbred is one of many legendary taxidermy horses exhibited in museums around the world -- forever ready to run their next race , charge onto the battle field , or star on the big screen			1
" taxidermy is a way to immortalize their story , as well as their actions and deeds , " said @entity38 , curator of the @entity9 exhibition at @entity8 's @entity40			0
" museums are all about experiencing ` the real thing , ' so presenting a preserved specimen is a way of doing that			1
" equine legends live on from @entity54 's horse , @entity55 , on display at the @entity57 in @entity58 , to actor @entity60 ' trusty sidekick , @entity59 , exhibited at a @entity62 tv network , the intriguing world of equine taxidermy is far from , well , dead			1
" what makes preserved famous creatures so different from hunting trophies or natural history specimens , is that most taxidermy is about preserving the animal 's form -- you 're not really trying to capture the spirit of the animal , " said @entity63 , author of @entity64 : taxidermy and the cultures of @entity77			2
" with famous creatures such as @entity9 , you 're preserving it because the animal has done something which is more than animal -- it has qualities such as courage , fortitude , endurance , which we like to think are in the human domain			0
" @entity90 there is perhaps no horse which embodies those virtues quite like @entity90			2
the gelding gained legendary status as the sole survivor on the @entity98 side of the @entity99 -- fought between @entity101 's troops and @entity102			1
two days after the clash which killed hundreds of combatants , @entity90 was discovered on the battlefield -- badly injured , but alive			2
when he died from colic 15 years later he was buried with full military honors , while his skin was preserved			0
today , long after the soldiers who rode him have turned to dust , @entity90 's taxidermy body remains standing to attention at @entity116 's @entity115			1
" @entity90 stands for many more things than being the lone survivor on the @entity98 side -- he stands for the relentless march of the @entity125 settlers across the great plains and the war against the @entity128 , " said @entity117 , director of the @entity118 at @entity116			1
" why do we taxidermy animals , or make wax models , or copy archaeological monuments , or hold historical re-enactments ? i guess it 's a way of understanding history better , of bringing it to life			1
" strike a pose but taxidermy , much like history , is never free from our own manipulation			0
when cowboy actor @entity60 had his sidekick , @entity59 , stuffed in 1965 , it was in a pose befitting a screen star			0
rearing on his hind legs and wearing an elaborately studded saddle , the golden palomino who appeared alongside @entity150 in dozens of films , was auctioned for a whopping $ 266,500 to cable company @entity152 in 2010			0
it appears that in death , @entity59 had become larger than life			2
" a taxidermy animal is just the skin of the animal , and of course the skin has no inherent shape or pose			1
" and that 's where the artistry and the human manipulation become involved			0
" " are you going to pose the lion sleeping or attacking an antelope ? all those decisions come in manufacturing the ultimate spectacle			0
" art imitating life while taxidermy attempts to recreate animals , it actually uses very little of their original parts			1
instead , the skin is usually stretched over an artificial skeleton and preserved with chemicals			2
features such as glass eyes or synthetic tongues are also added			0
" you have to have a solid knowledge of anatomy , " said @entity117			0
" one of the big problems with early taxidermy , was that the skin was susceptible to insect infestation			2
" virtually all the animals that have been stuffed before 1960 have great quantities of arsenic on them and still have to be handled with gloves			0
" alluring animals there is something both disconcerting and mesmerizing about coming face - to - face with animals who teeter in the realm between life and death			1
in the case of our hero horses , there is also a deep emotional turmoil at play -- we hold these animals in such high esteem that we feel compelled to stuff them for display			1
perhaps @entity63 sums up the enduring allure of taxidermy best : " there 's a psychological twist that you can never fully get to the bottom of			1

from race horses to war horses , museums display taxidermy equines
*includes* @entity90 , lone survivor of 1876 @entity99
taxidermy involves stretching real animal skin over artificial frame
enduring allure as animals teeter in realm between life and death
