-- a representative for @entity4 's mother who paid $ 25,000 for information on the whereabouts of her remains last month was an undercover @entity8 agent , a federal law enforcement official told @entity0			1
however , the @entity8 and the @entity11 attorney 's office in @entity12 , @entity13 , said wednesday that the @entity8 did not supply the money			1
" some news accounts have suggested that the @entity8 provided $ 25,000 in funds that were transmitted to @entity17			2
the funds involved were private funds , " the @entity8 and @entity11 attorney 's office said in a statement			2
an @entity25 document says van der @entity17 faces criminal charges in @entity13 because he allegedly tried to extort money from @entity29 's mother			1
@entity11 authorities filed extortion and wire fraud charges against van der @entity33 this week			1
the @entity8 and @entity11 attorney 's office in @entity12 arranged for a meeting where van der @entity17 was paid $ 10,000 in cash and another $ 15,000 in a wire transfer for information van der @entity17 allegedly promised would lead to @entity29 's body in @entity40 , a source familiar with the case said			1
the meeting took place in may , according to the @entity11 attorney 's office in @entity12			0
@entity25 documents show that the $ 15,000 was transferred to a personal bank account in the @entity49			0
the information van der @entity17 provided to the @entity8 was not true , according to the documents			1
it 's unclear if that money funded @entity17 's trip to @entity55 and into @entity56 , where authorities said he confessed this week to killing 21 - year - old @entity58			2
members of @entity61 ' family told @entity0 they knew days ago that the @entity8 had paid van der @entity33			1
" we really do n't have anything to say about it or what could have happened if we knew this information , " said brother @entity61 , speaking by phone from @entity56			0
" it wo n't make any change today			0
her mom is praying every day			0
we are not having contact with a lot of people			0
we want to be left alone			0
" although the investigation involving alleged extortion had been in motion for several weeks at the time of @entity61 ' death , " it was not sufficiently developed to bring charges prior to the time van der @entity17 left @entity40 , " the @entity8 statement said			1
" this is not due to any fault on the part of the @entity8 or the @entity11 attorney 's office , where agents and prosecutors were working as hard as possible to bring the case to fruition when they learned of the murder			2
a case based on events outside of the @entity11 is a complex matter , and work was proceeding with all deliberate speed to prepare the evidence , the charges and the necessary procedures to obtain custody of van der @entity33 , " the statement said			1
@entity17 , a @entity49 citizen , was twice arrested in connection with the 2005 disappearance of @entity29 but was released for lack of evidence			2

on or about march 29 , van der @entity17 contacted a representative of @entity29 's mother , @entity29 , say @entity112 documents			1
that came as a shock to @entity4 's father @entity4			0
@entity0 spoke with his attorney @entity116 in @entity40 wednesday			0
" he did n't know about it ... and he just did n't have very much to say about it because he was not involved , " the attorney said			0
in exchange for payment , van der @entity17 showed a person -- described in @entity25 documents as @entity29 's representative -- a house in @entity40 where supposedly @entity29 's remains were located			1
when records showed that the house was n't even built at the time of her disappearance , @entity17 admitted he lied , @entity25 said			2
@entity40 authorities were involved in the @entity8 's undercover investigation , @entity40 government spokesman @entity131 said			0
" we did some technical work " and " worked together , " @entity131 said			0
@entity0 's @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 contributed to this report .			0
