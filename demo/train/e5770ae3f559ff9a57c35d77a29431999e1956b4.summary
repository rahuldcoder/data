-- critics of climate action like to say that helping our environment would hurt our economy			1
climate - change denier sen. @entity6 has written that " manmade catastrophic global warming was the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the @entity11 people " and that cap - and - trade legislation could cause the loss of over 4 million jobs			1
@entity6 's views matter since he could become the new chairman of the @entity17 if @entity18 win the @entity19 in the november elections			0
but three new studies show climate action can improve the economy and create jobs			1
though transitioning to clean energy future will cause some disruption , unchecked environmental damage would cause catastrophic economic loss			1
so how can climate action help economy ? business leaders and economists said in a report that new technologies can spur both economic growth and better climate outcome			1
finance experts at the @entity37 -- hardly a bunch of tree - huggers -- made a similar point			0
in their paper about carbon pricing , they concluded that higher carbon prices can benefit individual countries even if others do n't match them			2
and economist @entity46 and his colleagues have shown that for every $ 1 million of investment in clean energy , the @entity11 can create 16.7 jobs compared with only 5.3 jobs from fossil fuel investments			1
overall , green energy investments combined with carbon taxes can create 2.7 million jobs in areas such as renewable energy , construction , manufacturing , transportation , new technologies and services -- even taking into account the transitional job loss from fossil fuel industries			1
we should pay attention to these ideas			0
@entity11 energy policy is backwards			1
federal and state governments give out over $ 20 billion in annual subsidies for fossil fuel exploration and production , which benefit highly profitable companies such as @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			1
but if the @entity11 implements even a modest federal carbon tax , we could generate $ 170 billion by 2030 to create jobs and build bridges , roads and schools , reduce budget deficits , and cut taxes to spur private investment			1
without carbon taxes , we treat our environment -- air , oceans and fresh water -- as a garbage dump where we fill up excess carbon			2
but the garbage can is overflowing because carbon emitters do n't pay the full price for carbon emissions			2
think of it this way : it 's like a bad neighbor who dumps garbage in the neighbors ' yards			0
that person saves money , but everyone else pays to clean up the foul mess and the entire neighborhood suffers			0
just like with trash , carbon taxes must bear the full cost of their negative effects			0
the first dollar of any carbon tax must help communities and workers in the transition to green economy			1
in fact , many fossil fuel job losses already have taken place			1
@entity124 coal mining employment fell from 120,000 in 1950 to 25,000 by 2011			0
carbon taxes are not the real threat to coal miners and their communities -- greedy energy companies are			2
these companies make profit but leave fewer jobs and harm communities			0
compensation to job losers , paid from carbon tax revenues , can be modeled after federal programs such as the @entity138 for displaced trade workers or the @entity141 's program that helps communities that lose military bases			1
there are successful policies that have reshaped market incentives to give clean energy and green jobs a fair chance			2
in 2011 , @entity150 expanded wind turbines and solar energy , aiming to replace all nuclear power			0
thirty percent of the country 's electricity is now derived from renewables			0
@entity150 's massive investments are driving down wind turbine and solar technology prices , making them more cost - effective			0
@entity160 , urged by an alliance of environmentalists , unions and community organizations , is changing a basic city service -- the commercial trash pickup -- to cut emissions from garbage trucks , increase recycling and encourage industries to use recycled materials , to achieve a " zero waste " target by 2050			0
these new trash policies will also create better , safer and higher - paying jobs			2
so the economic cost of moving to a clean energy economy is not anywhere near what the fear - mongering of @entity6 and others would have you believe			2
instead , we can create jobs , help those who are in transition , and save our precious common resource -- the planet where we all live			1
we just have to use our brains			0
as one marcher at the recent @entity192 's @entity191 aptly puts it in his protest sign : " @entity195 and @entity196 -- two problems , one solution			0
" there is only solution , and we must embrace it .			0

@entity203 : critics of climate action think helping environment would hurt economy
@entity203 : three new studies show taking climate action can create jobs
he says @entity11 energy policy is backwards with federal subsidies given to fossil fuel industries
@entity203 : a carbon tax can help the economy and workers transition to green energy future
