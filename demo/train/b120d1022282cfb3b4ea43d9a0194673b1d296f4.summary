@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's big , bold and oh so @entity0 -- a city far from unfamiliar with ostentatious developments			1
rising up from the turquoise waters of the @entity8 , @entity6 is arguably one of the grandest residential and cultural projects in the works anywhere in the world today			1
the idyllic resort will be home to three major museums , a performing arts center as well as hold space for 150,000 residents when it is completed by 2020			1
construction on the @entity21 -- named as the rain of light by architect @entity24 -- is going on around the clock with the aim of being open by december 2015			1
the @entity27 and the @entity28 will soon follow			1
see also : where are the world 's most expensive luxury properties ? for the new residents of @entity6 , many of whom are from outside the @entity1 , this ambitious development and its cultural accoutrements is like little they have experienced before			1
" it was so nice coming from @entity39 where everything has been going backwards to be part of something that was sort of up and coming and forward thinking , " said early resident , @entity37			0
as to be expected , however , living amidst such refined institutions and luxurious facilities does n't come cheap			0
@entity6 is being positioned by developers @entity45 as a luxury destination for those with deep pockets			2
a seven bedroom property comes in at a cool $ 7.5 million while the entry point for a villa is about $ 1.25 million			2
the @entity54 villas and apartments , part of a vast hotel complex , are already fully occupied			0
@entity45 says other completed zones are at 90 % capacity with most buyers choosing to take up residence in their new accommodation rather than snapping up the property as an investment and basing themselves elsewhere			0
see also : take a look at @entity67 's insane luxury basements " the thing about the people who buy in @entity6 , or if you want to call them investors , i can tell you that more than 80 % of the people who bought on @entity6 are end users , " said @entity69 chief development officer at @entity45			2
to further entice families , @entity45 is setting up a full range of educational options including offshoots of the renowned @entity81 boarding school and a @entity83 campus			1
the headmaster at @entity81 , @entity85 , believes even though the island is a greenfield project , it squares with the century and a half old history of the @entity39 school			1
" a motto was created for @entity81 called ' escuto rubu ' which is @entity92 for from culture comes strength , " @entity85 said			2
" we are standing on the edge of the cultural district here in fact on the gateway of the cultural district			2
i do n't think a school and a district could be better suited for one another than that			0
" but while every effort has been made to make new arrivals in the neighborhood welcome , the treatment of construction workers on the project has received unwanted scrutiny			0
see also : could micro-homes offer big housing solution @entity6 remains on the radar of human rights groups who contend there are still sizable gaps in fair in labor practices at the estimated $ 27 billion project			1
" we found that due to a sequence of control mechanisms which include recruitment fees , passport confiscation , and a kafala system of sponsorship based employment that workers on the island were being subjected to very serious exploitation , " @entity123 of @entity124 said			0
@entity45 however point to an independent report by @entity136 which acknowledges some flaws by contractors , but cited progress at the same time			0
" wherever we can improve we will not be late in improving , " said @entity69			0
" this is the @entity45 's position			0
