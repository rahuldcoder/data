-- @entity1 -- the prosecutor who secured the conviction in the infamous @entity4 murder case -- is himself now headed to prison			1
it was @entity1 's dogged 1994 prosecution and the subsequent conviction of @entity10 member @entity9 that helped trigger the reopening of dozens of civil rights cold cases			1
@entity1 became an instant hero of the civil rights movement			1
@entity16 portrayed him in the 1996 movie , " @entity18 , " and his closing statement was once dubbed one of the greatest closing arguments in modern law			0
" is it ever too late to do the right thing ? " @entity1 told the jury of eight blacks and four whites			1
" for the sake of justice and the hope of us as a civilized society , i sincerely hope and pray that it 's not			2
" @entity1 would go on to become a state judge in 2002			1
his years in the robe came to an end in 2009 , when @entity1 pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for lying to an @entity39 agent in a far - reaching corruption probe that has rocked @entity4 's judicial system			1
when he was sentenced in november , @entity9 's son sat in the chamber wearing a @entity45 flag pin on his red blazer			2
his father had also worn a @entity45 pin during the 1994 trial			0
@entity1 is to begin serving his 18 - month prison sentence today at a facility in @entity52			1
" the man has now been destroyed , politically and economically			1
it 's that serious , " said @entity54 , the brother of @entity55			1
he said he is trying to raise money to help pay @entity59 's expenses while he 's in prison			1
" what can we do but fight for a man who fought for us ? " he said			2
" i want @entity1 to know i 'm behind him 100 percent			1
" @entity1 's attorney , @entity64 , refused @entity0 's request to speak to the prosecutor - turned - judge ahead of his incarceration			1
" @entity1 remains a civil rights hero , and nothing is going to tarnish that , " @entity64 said			1
" the penalty he 's paying is enormous , and i think it 's sad and unfortunate			1
but that 's simply the way it is			2
" over the last month , @entity0 spoke with more than a dozen lawyers in @entity4 about @entity1 's fall from grace			1
they paint a picture of an ambitious man with a brilliant legal mind who ran afoul of the law -- of friends betraying friends and of big - time money corrupting the system			2
some take delight in his downfall ; others call it a tragedy that has stained the legal community			0
in the end , the lawyers said , @entity1 trusted one man too much : his mentor , @entity96 , who exploited their friendship and then turned on @entity59 to avoid prison			1
" this is a @entity103 tragedy in the sense that a person falls from grace due to their own character defects -- in this case , misplaced trust in a friend and , perhaps , some combination of ambition and hubris , " said @entity100 , a law professor at @entity101			0
the story of @entity1 going from civil rights hero to convicted felon is complicated , involving years of contentious litigation in his courtroom			1
at the heart of the case is @entity121 , a high - powered lawyer who made tens of millions of dollars in tobacco and asbestos litigation			0
@entity124 is the brother - in - law of former sen. @entity126 and is now serving seven years in prison for trying to influence @entity4 judges , including @entity1			1
according to prosecutors , @entity124 wanted to get to @entity1 through his mentor , @entity96 , to try to influence @entity1 's ruling in a high stakes case , potentially worth $ 15 million			1
@entity96 received $ 1 million in illicit payments as compensation for his actions , prosecutors say			0
@entity96 was granted immunity in exchange for his cooperation			0
" @entity4 would like to shake its image of being tied to civil rights crimes and the good ole boy network , and we see these two things overlap here , " @entity100 said			0
" it 's enormously unfortunate for a person like @entity148 who , at the very least , accomplished heroic things with bringing @entity9 to justice			2
and it 's tragic for the people of @entity4 -- that the end story here is that he is a corrupt judge in prison			1
" @entity1 has denied taking any money in the case or that he was improperly influenced			1
in his guilty plea , he admits to only obstruction of justice ; the more serious charges of involvement in a bribery scheme and mail fraud conspiracy were dismissed as part of the deal			2
" to me , he is a tragic figure because he had a good career and he threw it away , " said attorney @entity168			0
" he became an embarrassment to the legal community , to the judicial community and , i would hope , to himself			0
" @entity168 has an axe to grind with @entity1			1
he was one of the attorneys representing the client who stood to gain millions in the case at hand			0
@entity168 and @entity1 also trained under the same attorney several decades ago ; @entity168 believes @entity1 turned his back on everything they learned			1
" @entity1 betrayed every single oath he ever took			2
he betrayed the whole system of justice that we live by , " @entity168 said			0
" you measure a man by the whole of his life , not part of it			0
when the measure of the man is that he 's dishonest in the end , then you have to wonder why he did anything in the beginning			2
" @entity197 was one of two lawyers who represented @entity9 in the 1994 trial			0
he has known @entity148 for three decades , first as a defense attorney , then a prosecutor and finally as a judge			0
" quite frankly , i thought he was a very moderate , straight - down - the - line judge , " he said			0
he was shocked when allegations first surfaced			0
for a judge to be caught up in such a scandal , @entity197 said , is unfathomable			0
" if you ca n't have justice inside the justice system , then it 's no good at all			0
" @entity211 , the co-founder of the @entity212 , represented @entity213 , the widow of @entity55 -- the @entity214 leader who was gunned down in his driveway on june 12 , 1963			2
he says only one man had the guts to seek prosecution in the case when two previous trials years before ended without convictions			0
" if @entity1 had n't been around , it would never have happened			2
i can guarantee you that , " @entity211 said			0
" it was the first modern - day prosecution of one of these old civil rights - era murders , and it resulted in the prosecution and convictions of a large number later			0
" @entity1 's bravery in seeking justice in the @entity213 case , @entity211 said , makes it tough to swallow his more recent failings as a judge			1
" certainly , when a judge is put in prison and pleads guilty , " @entity211 said , " it certainly tarnishes his legal and judicial reputation			2
" @entity54 said he will continue fighting for the man who fought so valiantly for his brother			2
" we will do whatever 's necessary to help him get over his dilemma , and i 'll say that over and over again			0
" @entity213 blasted prosecutors for offering immunity to @entity96 , @entity1 's mentor who avoided jail time even though he was the one accepting illicit payments			1
" the man who squealed on him should be going to jail , " @entity213 said			0
" i hope that some day justice will be fair and equal			0
... it 's not fair and equal in this case			0
