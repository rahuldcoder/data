-- a drug already approved for treatment of @entity3 might one day be approved for prevention of the deadly disease in individuals at high risk			1
a @entity9 advisory committee recommended thursday that the agency approve the drug , @entity12 , for pre-exposure prophylaxis , or @entity14			1
the committee voted 19 - 3 in favor of approval for the prevention indication -- @entity14 for @entity20 - uninfected men who have sex with men and 19 - 2 with one abstention for @entity20 - uninfected partners in couples where the other partner is infected			1
the committee recommended by 12 - 8 with two abstentions in favor of approving the drug for individuals who engage in risky sexual behavior that could result in their contracting the virus			1
@entity12 , manufactured by @entity35 , is a once - a - day pill used in combination with other @entity20 drugs			1
the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor does not rid the body of @entity20			1
instead , it prevents the virus from replicating in the body			2
the @entity9 does n't have to follow the recommendations of its advisory committees , but it often does			1
most of the more than 40 health care professionals , @entity3 advocates and patients who addressed the committee implored its members not to recommend the drug for the new indication			1
" there is no question that , if efforts on using @entity14 is widespread , condom use and other means of preventing @entity20 infection will decrease , " said @entity55 , a registered nurse			2
" at this point we simply do n't know enough about how to increase adherence rates to work with the @entity14 or how to counteract the risk compensation and the use of @entity14			2
until then , @entity14 is not and can not be considered safe and effective for preventing hiv infections			2
" a recommendation for the use of @entity12 as @entity14 is akin to issuing an engraved invitation for lawsuits , " she said			2
" to knowingly recommend a drug as powerful as @entity12 with such serious serious side effects and given to people who are perfectly healthy is frightening			2
" @entity76 , president and founder of the @entity78 , said he was concerned that approval could lead a decrease in condom use			2
" approving @entity14 would be a reckless act , " he said			0
the @entity9 panel looked at safety and efficacy data from three clinical trials : -- @entity87 , a study of men who have sex with men , found 43.8 % fewer infections in men who got the drug versus those who got placebo ; -- in a @entity12 study carried out by the @entity99 in @entity100 , infection rates were reduced by 63 % overall in healthy men and women considered to be at high risk of infection ; -- the @entity107 's partners in @entity14 study of serodiscordant couples in @entity110 saw 62 % fewer infections in those taking @entity12 and a 73 % reduction in those who took a combination of @entity12 and the @entity20 drug tenofovir			1
committee members also heard concerns about the drug 's side effects , which can include nausea , vomiting , dizziness , loss of appetite and diarrhea , liver and kidney toxicity and loss of bone density			1
but , after assessing the data , they concluded that @entity12 is safe for men and women and effective in preventing infection			1
" what we need currently is additional tools for our powerful tool box , " said dr. @entity135 , director of clinical research at the @entity137 in @entity138			1
" we are not winning the battle			0
please , were asking today to allow a modality that 's still being developed to be added to our toolbox			0
" @entity146 , founder and ceo of @entity148 , made a plea on behalf of @entity150			0
" people need to be given the option to choose , " said @entity146 , who is hiv - positive			0
" this drug is wanted			0
another tool we can use			0
the right thing to do			0
without this option , desperation will continue to drive up statistics of new incidents			0
" @entity162 , vice president and director of public policy for the @entity165 , said the data on the drug 's prophylactic use were compelling and urged the committee not to limit access to it			1
" we need new tools to fight this epidemic that include treatment , condoms and education , " @entity162 said			0
" @entity14 is certainly not for everyone , but it may have a role in bringing hiv - infection rates down			0
it 's time to learn how @entity14 may be useful in the real world			0
" according to dr. @entity182 , a medical officer in the agency 's @entity183 , @entity12 's safety and efficacy for the prevention of hiv - 1 infection in high - risk individuals is supported by two large clinical trials			1
" regular hiv testing , adherence and behavioral counseling on safer sex practices , including condom use , are essential components of healthcare delivery around @entity14 , " he said			0
a month 's supply costs about $ 1,200 .			0
