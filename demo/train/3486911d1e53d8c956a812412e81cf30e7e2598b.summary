-- it 's not as futuristic as greenhouses on @entity3 , but farmers on terra firma are using space - based technology to certify organic crops			1
satellites have been used to prove that crops were fertilizer - free in a year - long project by @entity11 , one of @entity14 's leading organic certification agencies , and the @entity15			1
instead of just detailed overhead photos , infra - red and thermal images and other data was collected and deciphered to gain a " spectral signature " of the crops and soil			2
from that @entity11 say they can determine if a plant is organically - grown or not			0
the trials proved over 80 % successful , according to dr @entity25 of @entity11 , and compared to physically going to fields to collect , test and certify them , much more time effective			2
while the technology for organic certification needs to be improved -- the @entity11 test only worked on wheat and corn grown in large fields -- satellites are already sweeping huge swathes of the world 's arable land			1
from @entity41 vineyards and @entity43 rice fields to @entity45 coffee plantations and @entity47 crops , satellites imagery is being used to monitor land and water use and promote environmental protection			1
" satellites have become commonplace in agriculture , " says @entity51 , director of natural resource industries for global information software company @entity52			1
originally used to calculate subsidies owed to farmers in the @entity58 , the technology has developed at a rapid pace			0
" they are so good now , " says @entity51 " in the last few years six - inch imagery is commonplace			0
the level of detail of six - inch imagery on a field is incredible			0
people can genuinely use satellite imagery to fertilize correctly , or manage water stress			0
" through software developed by @entity52 and applied by @entity72 , a company that supplies data on water use and vegetation , individual farmers and small - holders are able to get the benefit of the precise information about the state of their crops			1
in an ongoing @entity72 project , funded by the @entity85 , farmers in @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity47 are sent a text message on when to irrigate or fertilize crops			1
another project to promote environmental protection in @entity90 measured the water consumption of natural vegetation compared to invasive species and agriculture for food production			1
while the satellites and information technology are hugely expensive the cost of the information to the end users and farmers is not			2
" depending on the resolution of the images , it can be anything from a few cents to a few euros per hectare , " says @entity102 of @entity72 there is still some way to go before satellites can take the place of farmers and be used to totally manage crops , water supplies and tell the difference between organic and non-organic crops			1
the main obstacles to better and cheaper data are improving the resolution of images so more crops in smaller spaces can be analyzed , plus the revisit times of the satellites			2
" but it 's still really good , " enthuses @entity51			0
" you 'd need lots of people to visit crops every week to do what a satellite can do			0
" for @entity102 the biggest role satellite geo - information will have in the future is in providing data on water conservation and management			0
" in a few years , we 'll have nine billion people living on this earth and in a lot of regions water is already scarce , but in about 50 % of these people will live in water stress positions			0
we can tell governments ' are you doing ok ? ' ( in water management ) or is there room for improvement , and that is really in quite high demand			0
