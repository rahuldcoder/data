-- were you hoping to spend the weekend viewing the beauty of the change of seasons at the @entity5 ? are you one of the 24 couples who had a wedding planned on the @entity8 in october ? did you plan to visit @entity9 on the 123rd anniversary of @entity12 's establishment in 1890 ? unless something changes soon , you wo n't be able to do any of those things because of the federal government shutdown			1
the shutdown has closed the 401 @entity18 sites across the country			1
visitors will be turned away , gates will be shut , tens of thousands of employees will be furloughed and communities will lose millions of dollars a day			1
only a few hundred yards from the congressional impasse , the @entity8 and its @entity26 in @entity27 now have a new feature : barricaded landmarks , including the @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity35 memorials			2
@entity36 are often called " @entity18 , " and now they are symbols of political dysfunction			1
they are not the reason for our country 's budget woes			0
but national parks and the people who rely on them -- visitors , school groups and businesses -- are once again collateral damage in a broken budget process			2
what 's worse , many national parks have been forced to close during their peak visitation season , places such as @entity55 and @entity56 , where people go to enjoy the fall foliage			0
and many people wait till the cooler months to visit places such as the @entity61 and @entity62			0
the potential loss of more than 750,000 daily visitors from around the world -- the number who typically visit national parks in october -- might cost local communities as much as $ 30 million each day the national parks are closed			1
the closure of @entity73 's crown jewels threatens the livelihood of park businesses , gateway communities and the @entity73 families within them , whose economies rely on national parks being open for business			1
families , school groups and tourists from around the world who have made plans to visit and enjoy our national heritage will face disappointment			0
opinion : in shutdown , @entity90 targets women -- again @entity93 , @entity94 , adjacent to @entity55 , attracts nearly 10,000 visitors daily in october			0
the loss of these visitors could be shattering to a community that relies on that final flush of tourism dollars before the steep drop - off in winter			0
@entity102 , executive director of the @entity103 , told me that with the impact of the sequester and the late opening of @entity55 's roads , business was already down about 30 % in april and may in comparison to the average over the last five years			0
" we just ca n't believe that @entity113 is letting this happen , " he said			2
the federal government shutdown has made a bad situation even worse for our national parks			1
over the past three years , the @entity18 's budget has been cut by 13 % , or about $ 315 million			0
these cuts have already forced national park superintendents to delay the opening of parks or park roads ; close visitor centers , picnic areas and campgrounds ; decrease the number of rangers to protect and maintain parks ; and limit the number of educational programs			2
countless students across the country have been denied educational opportunities in national parks and opportunities that would shape their love of the outdoors and parks for the rest of their lives			0
we need @entity113 to do two things : reopen our national parks and then restore the funding they lost because of the damaging sequester			1
our national parks are treasured by @entity73 nationwide			0
the federal government has a responsibility to keep them open and adequately funded			1
today , @entity12 's birthday has been spoiled for the @entity73 people and for tourists from around the world			0
we need @entity113 and the president to reopen our parks and reach a budget agreement that keeps @entity73 's greatest places protected and open from now on			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			2

@entity161 : the federal government shutdown has closed the @entity36
she says this means loss of millions to parks , businesses , nearby communities
she says parks , already hurt by earlier cuts , now symbol for congressional dysfunction
@entity161 : @entity113 must restore *services* to funds to parks and reopen them
