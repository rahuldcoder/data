@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 separatist group @entity3 said monday it was declaring a permanent cease - fire			1
in a statement released to the @entity4 newspaper @entity7 -- where it typically releases information -- @entity3 said it declares a permanent general and verifiable cease - fire as a " firm commitment towards a process to achieve a lasting resolution and toward an end to the armed confrontation			1
" @entity1 interior minister @entity16 said that the statement that the government wants to see is one where @entity3 calls for a definitive end , which he said the statement does not do " am i more tranquil today than before ? yes , " @entity22 said			2
" is this the end ? i would say no. " @entity1 's @entity25 government has repeatedly called for @entity3 to announce unilaterally a definitive end to its decades of separatist violence , blamed for more than 800 deaths , and a pledge to lay down its weapons			2
@entity3 wants @entity4 independence in northern @entity1 and southwest @entity32			1
various @entity4 leftist parties -- including the @entity35 party , outlawed for its links to @entity3 -- as well as four @entity38 peace laureates and the @entity39 also have called in recent months for the organization to establish a permanent and verifiable cease - fire			1
the @entity35 party 's ban from running candidates in municipal elections will not be lifted because of @entity3 's statement , the interior minister said			0
the latest statement comes after weeks of speculation in @entity1 that @entity3 would issue a statement during the holiday season			2
" it is time to act with historical responsibility			0
@entity3 calls upon those governing @entity1 and @entity32 to end all repressive measures and to leave aside for once and for all their position of denial towards the @entity59 , " the statement said			2
another part of the message said , " the solution will come through the democratic process with dialogue and negotiation as its tools and with its compass pointed towards the will of the @entity4 people			0
" " @entity3 will continue its indefatigable struggle and efforts to promote and to bring to a conclusion the democratic process until there is a truly democratic situation in the @entity59 , " it added			0
the organization has announced cease - fires before and broken them , notably its unilateral 2006 cease - fire that was announced as " permanent , " only to be broken months later with a car bomb at @entity0 's airport that killed two people			1
despite @entity3 's current cease - fire , in effect since september , the government has not eased up on the police pressure against @entity3 operatives in @entity1 and the organization 's hideouts in neighboring @entity32 and @entity90			1
in the past few years , police have arrested many of @entity3 's suspected top operatives , as well as many of its foot soldiers , and seized bomb - making materials and weapons from hidden arms caches , virtually shutting off @entity3 attacks			0
there are about 800 @entity3 convicts or suspects in prison , mainly in @entity1 but also in @entity32 , the @entity99 said recently			1
@entity3 's statement comes two days after a march saturday in the largest @entity4 city , @entity107 , by relatives and friends of the prisoners			0
they want the prisoners transferred to jails in the @entity4 region instead of being dispersed across @entity1 , which authorities have said is done for security purposes			0
@entity3 is listed as a terrorist group by the @entity119 and the @entity120 for its campaign of car bombings and shootings			0
the @entity1 government of prime minister @entity125 began a peace process in 2006 during @entity3 's earlier unilateral cease - fire , but after the organization detonated an airport bomb , the government called off negotiations			1
since then , officials of @entity125 's government have said they would not accept another cease - fire , only a definitive statement from @entity3 that it would end its armed fight , and specifying when and where it would lay down its arms forever			2
the @entity4 region in northern @entity1 already has considerable home - rule authority , with its own police , parliament , taxing power and control of health and education			1
but @entity3 rejects those as partial steps , and has fought for full independence			0
@entity3 's goal is an independent @entity4 nation comprising the three - province @entity4 region and the neighboring @entity152 region in @entity1 , along with three departments in southwest @entity32 that also have @entity4 roots			1
about 3 million people live in those areas now			0
officials have said that in recent years , @entity3 has become weaker and more isolated from its traditional base of popular support .			0
