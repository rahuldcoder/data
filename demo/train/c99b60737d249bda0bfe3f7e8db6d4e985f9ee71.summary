-- @entity1 , a @entity2 national convicted of raping and killing a 16 - year - old girl in 1994 , was executed by lethal injection thursday evening in @entity6			1
the case 's flurry of legal appeals and pleas for clemency were prompted by an international dispute over the rights of the foreign - born on @entity15 death rows			1
the @entity16 earlier denied a stay of execution for the convicted killer , despite opposition from the @entity22 administration and the @entity2 government			1
@entity1 was pronounced dead at 6:21 p.m. ct ( 7:21 p.m. et ) , according to a corrections spokeswoman			1
" i am sorry for everything i have done , " @entity1 said at the @entity26 facility before he was executed			1
" i have hurt a lot of people			2
let this be final and be done			0
i take the full blame for this			0
" @entity1 then shouted " @entity37 , " followed by " i 'm ready warden , let 's get the show on the road			1
" his last meal consisted of fried chicken , @entity39 , tacos , two colas and a bowl of fried okra			0
what made @entity1 's conviction unusual was that he was not informed about his right to contact the @entity2 consulate upon his arrest -- a right guaranteed under a binding international treaty			1
@entity1 's appellate lawyers argued such access could at the very least have kept @entity53 off death row			2
@entity2 strongly condemned the execution , saying it violated an @entity57 ruling ordering the @entity15 to review capital convictions of @entity2 nationals			1
@entity1 , 38 , was convicted of raping @entity60 , a 16 - year - old girl in @entity61 , and then fatally strangling and bludgeoning her with a 35 - pound piece of asphalt in 1994			2
the @entity16 justices split 5 - 4 along conservative - liberal lines in denying a stay of execution			1
in an unsigned opinion by the majority , the court refused to delay the execution until @entity72 could pass pending legislation giving federal courts the authority to hear similar claims from foreign inmates			2
" we decline to follow the @entity15 ' suggestion of granting a stay to allow @entity1 to bring a claim based on hypothetical legislation when it can not even bring itself to say that his attempt to overturn his conviction has any prospect of success , " said the majority			1
in dissent , four justices led by @entity89 urged a delay in moving ahead with @entity1 's execution			1
" it is difficult to see how the @entity99 's interest in the immediate execution of an individual convicted of capital murder 16 years ago can outweigh the considerations that support additional delay , perhaps only until the end of the summer , " said @entity89 , who was supported by justices @entity93 , @entity95 , and @entity96			2
@entity106 , lead appellate attorney , said , " it is shameful that mr. @entity1 will pay the price for our inaction			2
the need for congressional action to restore our reputation and protect our citizens is more urgent than ever			0
" " this case was not just about one @entity2 national on death row in @entity6 , " @entity106 said in a statement			1
" the execution of mr. @entity1 violates the @entity15 ' treaty commitments , threatens the nation 's foreign policy interests , and undermines the safety of all @entity15 abroad			1
" the state 's @entity124 ruled that @entity1 did not deserve to have his death sentence commuted to life in prison without parole			2
the victim 's mother , @entity130 , had called for the execution			2
" a technicality does n't give anyone a right to come to this country and rape , torture and murder anyone , in this case my daughter , " she told @entity0 affiliate @entity133 in @entity61			0
@entity145 described her daughter as " a beautiful , bright , vibrant young woman , full of hope and aspirations			0
" " it 's been difficult for myself and her family members , " she added			0
" she certainly was taken away from us at a very young age			0
" @entity1 's lawyers argued the consulate access violation was more than a technicality			1
@entity106 told @entity0 that @entity2 officials would have ensured @entity1 had the most competent trial defense possible , if they had been able to speak with him right after his felony arrest			1
" i think in most of these cases it was not a deliberate thing			0
local police lack training " on the @entity167 , @entity106 said , referring to the international agreement that includes consular access			0
@entity1 's backers say he had learning disabilities and brain damage , and suffered from sexual abuse at the hands of his parish priest , and that consul officials would have assisted in such a defense			1
they say those factors should have been considered at the sentencing phase of the trial			0
@entity1 claimed he did not learn of his consular access right until two years after his capital conviction			2
he said he learned of the right not from any official , but from a fellow prisoner			0
eventually , between 2010 and 2011 , @entity1 was visited by a representative of the @entity2 government more than 10 times , said @entity189 , press relations spokeswoman with the @entity191 in @entity61			1
the state argued that @entity1 -- who has lived in the @entity15 since age 2 -- never revealed his @entity2 citizenship at the time of arrest , and his defense team never raised the consular access issue at or before trial			1
prosecutors also said the evidence against him was indisputable			0
the victim was tortured , and a bite mark on her body was matched to @entity53			0
a bloody shirt belonging to @entity206 was discovered at the suspect 's home			0
the two had attended a party separately earlier that evening			0
the girl 's nude body was found on a dirt road			0
@entity1 was one of 40 @entity2 citizens awaiting lethal injection in @entity15 prisons			1
the issue turned on what role each branch of government plays in giving force to international treaty obligations			0
three years ago , the @entity16 justices concluded @entity6 could execute another @entity2 man sentenced to death for murder			1
@entity227 was given a lethal injection by the state a few months later			0
the question then and now is whether the state has to give in to a demand by the president that the prisoner be allowed new hearings and sentencing			0
in the 2008 case , president @entity237 made that demand reluctantly after an international court concluded @entity241 was improperly denied access to his consulate before his original prosecution , a violation of the treaty signed by the @entity15 decades ago			1
the @entity2 government filed a supporting appeal with the high court in @entity250 this past week , asking the justices to block @entity1 's execution , citing @entity237 's previous executive action			1
on friday , the @entity22 administration asked @entity6 to delay the execution			1
" this case implicates @entity15 foreign policy interests of the highest order , " including protecting @entity15 citizens abroad and promoting good relations with other countries , new solicitor general @entity256 said			2
@entity72 has also stepped in			0
sen. @entity263 , @entity264 , chairman of the @entity265 , introduced a bill in june to formally grant federal courts the power to review these kinds of appeals			0
" this case is not an isolated instance ; the issue of consular notification remains a serious diplomatic and legal concern , " @entity263 said thursday			0
@entity6 @entity277 gov. @entity277 's office countered that a federal appeals court had already given @entity1 the judicial scrutiny the @entity22 administration and the @entity281 seek , ultimately rejecting his claims			1
" if you commit the most heinous of crimes in @entity6 , you can expect to face the ultimate penalty under our laws , " @entity283 , spokeswoman for the governor , told @entity0			2
" @entity72 has had the opportunity to consider and pass legislation for the federal courts ' review of such cases since 2008 , and has not done so each time a bill was filed			0
" @entity296 , the state 's former solicitor general who argued the 2008 @entity16 case for @entity6 , said @entity1 waited too long to raise these issues			1
" the question is not should a foreign national have the right to contact their consulate , " @entity296 told @entity0			2
" the question is , years later , after they have been tried , after they have been convicted , after it has been clear like @entity1 that they are a vicious child rapist and murderer , should you come in and set aside that conviction			2
you ca n't come back years later and try and set aside your trial with some additional claim you wish you had raised			0
" @entity296 is now running for the @entity312 as a @entity314 candidate			0
the @entity16 appeal is @entity1 v. @entity6 ( 11 - 5001 )			1
