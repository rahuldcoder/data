as an argument between @entity2 and her boyfriend escalated in their @entity5 home more than 20 years ago , he started to become violent			2
@entity2 's friend @entity7 , who 'd come over to check on her , picked up the phone to call the police			1
soon , @entity2 's boyfriend redirected his fury			1
it was n't until he turned his attention from @entity2 and began beating @entity7 with the phone that it clicked			2
" it was such an eye opener to what he had been doing to me , " @entity2 said			2
@entity7 's reaction was not to cower , as @entity2 had done in the past when her boyfriend flew off the handle			1
she fended off the violent man , and @entity2 helped her			2
" i saw then that he was n't this superhuman			0
two pretty slight girls were able to subdue him , " @entity2 said			0
( @entity28 is using only first names to protect the women 's privacy			1
) @entity7 had told @entity2 time and again that her partner was abusive			1
" i made all sorts of excuses for him : he was stressed , having a bad day , etc. mostly i blamed myself for it , " @entity2 said			0
inspired by @entity7 's actions , @entity2 obtained a restraining order , and the police removed him from the home			1
their nearly two - year relationship was over			0
" i surrounded myself with friends , kept busy , but i did n't get a healthy mindset until years later , " @entity2 said			1
to an outsider 's eye , the issue of domestic violence can be black and white : just leave			1
for those left physically and emotionally black and blue , that zero - tolerance perspective is n't as clear , creating a disconnect between the abused and those who care for them			0
when pop stars @entity58 and @entity60 affectionately attended a @entity62 game together on christmas day , many were left scratching -- or shaking -- their heads over the potentially rekindled romance			0
@entity58 had been sentenced in august 2009 for felony assault on @entity60 , his then - girlfriend			0
he was required to serve probation , do 1,400 hours of community service and complete a 52 - week domestic violence program			1
opinion : @entity60 making a bad decision ? after their outing became public , @entity28 reader @entity74 commented on the @entity78 blog , " when he beats her up again ( it 's only a matter of time ) , i will not feel sorry for her			1
only an idiot sticks their head in the @entity86 's mouth twice just to see if the @entity86 bites			1
" he was n't alone in expressing anger and bewilderment over @entity60 's decision to welcome @entity58 back into her life			1
witnesses to abusive relationships often ask : why go back ? @entity94 , president of the @entity95 and the @entity96 , says there are countless reasons a victim returns to or stays in an abusive relationship : low self - worth , financial worries , fear of what the abuser would do if the abused left , even love			1
friends and family are often an integral part of the victim 's way out			1
according to @entity111 , loved ones of the abused are the second most frequent callers to her organization 's help line , behind the abused themselves			1
" what can we do , because she does n't want to leave ? " they ask			0
( @entity111 uses " she " and " her " because only 3 % of the hot line 's callers are male			1
but domestic violence affects men too : a 2010 @entity125 survey found that more than one in three women and more than one in four men had experienced violence by an intimate partner			1
) @entity111 said an abused woman will leave a relationship approximately seven times before she leaves for good			0
the back and forth can frustrate friends and family			1
if victims feel supported , they may grow stronger and more confident			1
" it 's really important for her to make the decision to leave			2
he 's controlling decision - making , so if you seem to control her decision as well , it 's not good , " @entity111 said			2
being supportive does n't mean telling the abused over and over that they should leave			0
instead , offer a listening ear for when they 're ready to open up			1
" ' i really care about you ; i 'm your friend ; i want to make sure you 're ok ; and i want to let you know i 'm here for you , ' " @entity111 suggested			2
@entity111 also notes that if you think an abused person 's life is at risk , you should be " very careful " about calling 911			2
" if the police show up and they do n't arrest him for whatever reason , that could be a really bad situation for her , " @entity111 said			0
an alternative is to offer the victim a safe place to stay or a referral to a shelter			1
even if the victim does n't listen the first or second or eighth time , it 's important not to give up , @entity111 said			1
the mantra : " i respect your decision			0
here are some tips to keep you safe			0
" if an abuse victim feels judged by a friend or family member , he or she could lose trust , withdraw and become skeptical of talking about the abuse to anyone else			1
when @entity184 's sister , @entity183 , left her second abusive relationship , she turned to her family , who had stuck by her and helped her move away from her first abuser			1
during that year - long relationship , @entity183 often refused help but would n't get angry when the family offered , @entity184 said			2
" i have no doubt that she could have survived on her own ; she 's a strong woman			2
i think the most important thing was that we validated her feeling that things were n't right , " @entity184 said			0
@entity183 managed to extricate herself from her first abusive relationship , and according to @entity184 , her new boyfriend was " so nice and welcoming when i visited			0
he seemed really sweet to her most of the time			0
" then , @entity183 's boyfriend kicked her out of the house with no money			2
she needed a place to stay , so she picked up the phone and called their father again for help			0
" she did n't give many details , just that she was kicked out of the house			0
slowly , other details started coming through , but i think it took her a while to really accept that she was in an abusive situation , " @entity184 said			0
it was n't until much later that she mentioned to @entity184 that he had even , at one point , threatened her with a gun			0
@entity183 never pressed charges or called the police			0
she still has to keep in contact with her abuser because they share custody of their children			0
her family is still behind her , even with the knowledge that they ca n't fix everything			2
" i felt absolutely helpless , " @entity184 said			0
" the survivor has to be the one to take action and make decisions			0
it 's not easy to admit that you ca n't just come to the rescue for your little sister			2
