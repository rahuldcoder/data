-- if there is one man who knows how to spoil a @entity5 party then it 's @entity6			1
while the majority of the 15,000 crowd packed inside @entity13 roared their home favorite @entity15 at every opportunity , their hopes of a @entity10 champion were extinguished once again			1
this was a pulsating clash between two men straining every ounce of energy from their tired bodies and stretching every sinew			0
@entity6 , so dominant for so long after taking the opening two sets 6 - 4 6 - 1 , appeared set to return to his hotel early enough for a night out on the @entity25			1
but @entity15 , as infuriating as he is talented , did what he does best -- he entertained			1
the @entity30 , playing to the crowd , took the next two sets 6 - 4 6 - 1 before imploding when the tie looked his for the taking			2
not since @entity34 was crowned champion in 1983 has @entity30 witnessed one of its own triumph on the clay			0
alas , the wait will now extend into a 32nd year			0
@entity6 , who seemed to thrive on the partisan nature of the contest , eased to a 6 - 4 6 - 1 lead and seemingly had the match all wrapped up			1
in 2012 , @entity6 defeated @entity30 @entity44 in a similar setting , and that experience appeared to allow him to settle rather quickly			1
the @entity47 , who was so impressive during his victory over @entity51 's @entity50 , looks to be far more comfortable with his game following a troublesome back injury			2
against @entity15 , a player he often practiced with and competed against as a child , he showed a maturity which the @entity30 sometimes lacks			1
nobody can doubt @entity15 ' ability to entertain but with that comes a constant frustration to combine his style with substance			1
after conceding the first set , @entity15 lost the plot completely in the second before rallying to ensure he at least won a game			1
the third was more competitive with the home crowd urging the @entity68 to respond and take the contest into a fourth set			0
and their hero finally responded , converting the third of three set points to take the third 6 - 4			0
with the momentum firmly behind him , @entity15 broke to take a 4 - 1 lead in the fourth			1
suddenly , playing with the joie de vivre which had been missing earlier in the contest , @entity15 appeared unstoppable			1
he claimed the fourth set 6 - 1 and appeared set to apply the @entity80			0
but just as the home crowd was about to celebrate a famous victory , @entity6 wrecked any thoughts of popping @entity85 corks			2
he swept @entity15 away with disdain -- 6 - 0 to secure the match , finish the contest and throw down the gauntlet to his next opponent -- champion @entity91			1
@entity91 can anybody stop @entity91 ? that 's the question @entity6 will have to answer			1
@entity94 , the man vanquished in last year 's final by the eight - time @entity10 champion , was the latest man to feel the wrath of the " @entity91 "			1
after a slow start in which he conceded the first set 6 - 4 , @entity91 hit back to take the next three sets 6 - 4 6 - 0 6 - 1			1
the @entity102 , who was beaten at @entity104 in april by @entity94 , remains a huge favorite to win the title			2
@entity107 progresses @entity107 nearly quit tennis a year ago -- now she stands on the verge of reaching a first grand slam final			2
the @entity111 , who lost in qualifying at @entity10 12 months ago , made the last eight at three of the four grand slams in 2011			0
but her career threatened to derail when she suffered back , knee and ankle injuries and spiraled down the rankings to 177 -- before returning to the tour in march 2013			0
the 26 - year - old , ranked 27 , proved too good for @entity123 's @entity122 as she carved out a 6 - 2 6 - 2 victory			2
" today i was in a real zone , " she told reporters			0
" i stepped up my game when i needed to			0
" i do n't think i 'm coming from nowhere to the semifinals			0
it 's a very special moment , i have n't been there before			0
" @entity107 , who is the first @entity111 lady to reach the semifinals since @entity134 in 1999 , now faces a showdown with @entity137 's @entity136			1
@entity136 , the highest seed left in the draw , overcame 2009 champion @entity140 of @entity141 6 - 2 6 - 2 to claim a place the semifinal of a grand slam for the first time			2
@entity136 , ranked fourth in the world , won the junior event on the clay in 2008 and is now hoping to do the double by winning the @entity10 proper			2
" i felt very good on court			0
it was a perfect day for me			0
i played really well and stuck to my gameplan , " she told reporters			0
" i was very aggressive			0
so it was a good match , and i 'm really happy that now i can play in the semifinals in @entity5			0
