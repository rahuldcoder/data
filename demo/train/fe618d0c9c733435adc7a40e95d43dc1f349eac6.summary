@entity1 , @entity0 -- a @entity3 was killed in action and several others wounded thursday in a major @entity7 - led offensive in southern @entity0 , the @entity3 said			1
@entity7 @entity3 prepare for @entity8 at @entity9 , @entity0 , on thursday			1
the push , called @entity8 , is targeting militants in @entity13 province , a @entity15 stronghold and poppy - growing region			1
the forces are attempting to gain and hold ground in the perilous region ahead of national elections in august			0
almost 4,000 @entity3 and sailors , along with several hundred @entity0 security forces and @entity24 troops , worked to clear @entity15 militants from population centers in the @entity28 valley			1
they have been operating in the districts of @entity30 and @entity31 in central @entity13 province and " as far south as the vicinity of @entity34 , the capital of @entity35 in the region of the @entity28 valley known as ' @entity38			2
' " the @entity3 stressed the mission " is to provide security for population centers " and " connect local citizens with their legitimate government while establishing stable and secure conditions for national elections			2
" @entity13 's governor , @entity46 , said he believes the operation will work and has assured the populace that it will provide security for them			0
his spokesman also confirmed that resistance had been minimal			0
the @entity3 said about 80 percent of the @entity7 troops are in direct combat , with the rest working in support			1
@entity15 resistance has been light and sporadic , consisting of intermittent small arms fire , the @entity3 said on thursday			1
the troops have encountered only relatively small groups of militants			0
" indications are the militants break away shortly after they make contact , " @entity3 spokesman 1st lt. @entity62 said , referring to what is regarded as the @entity15 's habit of running and hiding after troops confront them			1
a @entity15 spokesman said the group 's fighters had killed 33 soldiers and destroyed several vehicles			1
@entity2 could not independently verify the @entity15 claims because of safety and access issues			2
there has been an outcry in @entity0 over civilian deaths in the @entity0 war 's crossfire , with much ire directed toward coalition air operations			2
but the @entity84 emphasized in a news release that the @entity3 have not " received any confirmed reports of civilian casualties or damage to property			0
" they said they have not utilized " artillery or other indirect fire weapons , and no bombs have been dropped from aircraft			0
" the brigade operates under @entity96 's @entity95			0
the assault has prompted @entity99 authorities to redeploy troops along the @entity0 border to stop @entity15 from escaping the push in @entity13			1
more than 30 @entity7 , @entity24 and @entity104 troops have been killed there since january , with the latest being the @entity3 on thursday and a pair of @entity24 soldiers slain in @entity13 on wednesday			1
the push is the largest since the @entity107 began moving additional troops into the conflict this year , and it comes after a @entity24 - led operation launched last week in the same region , the @entity3 said			2
when president @entity114 announced his strategy toward @entity0 and @entity99 , he said @entity7 soldiers and @entity3 " will take the fight to the @entity15 in the south and the east , and give us a greater capacity to partner with @entity0 security forces and to go after insurgents along the border			1
" he also said the bolstered deployment " will also help provide security " ahead of august presidential elections in @entity0			0
the @entity114 administration has moved about 21,000 @entity7 troops to @entity0 , the original front in the war launched after the september 11 attacks			1
it is also the first big move since @entity7 gen. @entity136 took over as the allied commander in @entity0 in mid-june			1
in @entity139 , a senior defense official said the size and scope of the new operation are " very significant			1
" " it 's not common for forces to operate at the brigade level , " the official said			0
" in fact , they often only conduct missions at the platoon level			0
and they 're going into the most troubled area of @entity0			0
" the defense official said the operation is a " tangible indication " of the new approach that @entity136 -- a former chief of the @entity107 's special operations command -- is bringing to the nearly eight - year war			0
" they 're not just doing an offensive push to get bad guys ; they 're going in to hold the area and stay there , " the official said			0
" this approach is indicative of @entity136 's philosophy : measuring success by the number of @entity0 protected , not bad guys killed			1
" during his confirmation hearing in june , @entity136 told senators that the conflict requires a new focus on counterinsurgency to reduce violence and build support for the @entity7 - led @entity96 alliance among @entity0			1
" although i expect stiff fighting ahead , the measure of success will not be enemy killed			0
it will be shielding the @entity0 population from violence , " he said			2
the @entity183 fundamentalist @entity15 ruled most of @entity0 before its allies in @entity185 attacked @entity186 and @entity139 on september 11 , 2001			2
though quickly toppled after the attacks , its leaders escaped , and the movement regrouped in the @entity0 countryside and across the border in @entity99			0
@entity13 was once known as the breadbasket of @entity0 , but the fertile land is now used for growing poppies			0
@entity0 produces more than 90 percent of the world 's opium , with most of that coming from the poppies in @entity13			2
the drug trade is an import source of income for the @entity15 and major supply routes run through the province			0
@entity2 's @entity204 in @entity0 , @entity205 in @entity99 and @entity206 and @entity207 at the @entity107 contributed to this report .			2

one @entity3 killed , others wounded ; @entity15 says 33 soldiers killed
4,000 @entity7 troops , hundreds of @entity0 involved in @entity8
it focuses on @entity28 , *hotbed* of @entity15 violence
@entity220 's size and scope are " very significant , " official says
