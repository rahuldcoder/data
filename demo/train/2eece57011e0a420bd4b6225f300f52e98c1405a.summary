-- in @entity4 's new prime time drama , " copper , " @entity2 - immigrant detective @entity1 roams from the filthy slums of five points to the glimmering sidewalks of @entity8 -- all with a set of brass knuckles snugly resting on his fingers			1
the year is 1864 , and the tattered remnants of an ongoing @entity15 remain in @entity16			1
blood is regularly spilled on the cobblestones and in dirty back alleyways			2
no one gives a man carrying the body of a young dead girl through the streets a second glance , but they balk at the idea of women wanting to vote			2
it seems oddly fitting that " copper , " premiering on sunday at 10 p.m. et , takes place in @entity32 , and is the channel 's first original scripted series			1
the @entity32 branch of the well - known @entity37 network wanted to explore a part of @entity40 history that has only been seen in " @entity41			2
" historically accurate details , woven into the backbone of " copper , " transform it from period drama to believable reality			1
for @entity48 , the world of " copper " came to life as she was laced tightly into her corset , learning to breathe as her character , socialite @entity53 , would breathe			1
for @entity55 , it was leafing through the worn leather journal of his character , dr. @entity57 , to discover ornate , accurate sketches of medicinal roots from 1864			1
and for @entity61 , it was opening a keepsake box of letters , only to find actual letters that gave him more insight into his character , detective @entity1			0
@entity68 became so immersed in his character , detective @entity70 , that he consistently ate with his prop knife			0
" it 's about honoring the details , " @entity72 said			1
" and it 's an added bonus if you have something to dig into , and take you away from yourself			2
although the series carries certain devices of other crime dramas , they are covered in the grit and deceit of a point in @entity16 's history that is rarely portrayed			1
the actors sport hand - sewn satin gowns and rugged leather coats against a realistic backdrop of swampy , methane stench - ridden five points and the clean - swept cream - colored sidewalks of @entity8 on a 212,500 square - foot studio lot			1
treachery , deceit and intrigue are rampant in five points , and disguised little better behind the facades of the @entity8 brownstone			1
" there is something very underdog - ish about all of the characters played by @entity106 , @entity48 , @entity107 and i , " @entity61 said			0
" we 've all come up from below for very different reasons			0
" his character , @entity1 , embodies a blend of backstreet tenacity and well - honed honor as he doggedly pursues the truth amidst his own crookedly led @entity116			0
the 10 - part series , created by @entity118 ( best known for " @entity120 " and other dramas ) and produced by @entity121 ( the acclaimed director of films like " diner " ) , unfurls with @entity1 investigating a girl 's death while trying to find his missing wife and solve his daughter 's murder			1
meanwhile , he reconnects with two men , aristocrat @entity131 , played by @entity106 , and physician @entity57 , who @entity1 fought alongside during the @entity15			0
the series explores the mysterious events that forged their bond during their time served in the @entity138			1
while the plot may be full of dark twists and turns , there are also unexpected moments of humor			0
" to find humor in the darkness is a very @entity121 [ @entity147 ] thing , " @entity72 said			0
" @entity121 always sees the humor in every moment			0
that 's life -- however dark things get , the reality of the moment is actually kind of funny , and that 's something @entity61 [ @entity154 ] and @entity121 do very well , this balance of light and dark			2
" moral ambiguity is what connects most of the characters to one another , although societal differences try to keep them apart			0
for @entity72 , playing a woman in 1864 gave the added challenge of balancing an old - fashioned constraint with her own mettle			2
" it was really about marrying two aspects : being tightly bound physically but at the same time , being very spirited and free inside , " she said			0
@entity55 faced the same challenge as another intelligent " underdog " of the time			0
" kind of the way @entity48 is bound by her clothes , station and by being a woman , i am bound by being a black man in 1864 , where racism is rampant and pretty much the norm of society , " @entity55 said			2
" he is a fantastically gifted physician and scientist so there is that want , especially as a man , to say ' look at all the stuff i am doing , ' but not being able to express his own pride in his work and display it because of the unfortunate nature of racism			0
" the scenes are juxtapositions of brothels to drawing rooms , and ripped rags to tiered silk dresses			0
" copper " layers these settings , between five points and @entity8 , with @entity202 , a developing @entity40 community that later becomes part of @entity205 , while weaving in societal tensions of immigration and race			1
amidst the turbulence , " copper " hopes to illustrate where @entity32 , and @entity16 , came from by showing such a pivotal point in the city 's history			1
" we 're really watching the birthplace of @entity218 happen and i think that is a pretty dynamic environment , " @entity72 said			0
but you may have to wait until the @entity223 releases to see an extra when @entity72 and @entity106 drop it like it 's hot to @entity226 's " @entity227 " in period costume during a ballroom scene			2
" sex , drugs , violence and sir @entity226 , " @entity106 and @entity61 joked			0
" what 's not to like ? " watch the trailer for " copper "			1
