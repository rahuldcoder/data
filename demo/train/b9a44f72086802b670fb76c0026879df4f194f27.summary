@entity0 -- at the @entity3 this week , sen. @entity2 talked tough on the international hotspot of the day , @entity5			1
" it 's time to act now			0
i do n't want to score political points on this issue , i want to see it resolved , " @entity2 told @entity8 's @entity7 , the event 's moderator			1
@entity2 says he does n't want to score political points , but like it or not -- every move he makes these days is viewed through one prism : a potential vice presidential pick for @entity18			1
for many @entity19 , @entity2 is prime running mate material -- a fresh - faced , telegenic tea party favorite from @entity23 , a key battleground state			1
and he is , of course , @entity25 -- a fast - growing ethnic group in the @entity27 , a group @entity28 dominated in presidential elections over the past four decades			0
the impact of the ' latino vote ' beyond @entity32 in 2008 , only 31 % of @entity33 voted for sen. @entity34			1
nearly 7 in 10 voted for then - sen. @entity35			0
the best a @entity19 presidential candidate has ever done with @entity37 was @entity38 in 2004 , and he got just 44 % of the group 's vote			1
a fair number of @entity19 strategists say that if @entity18 were to pick a @entity37 running mate , it could bridge the huge gap			1
" republicans need about 40 % of the @entity25 vote to be competitive nationally , " said @entity19 strategist @entity45			2
" to add a candidate who happens to be of @entity25 descent is incredibly important , not only because it shows the party can be inclusive , but open - minded @entity37 independent voters will really see this is a reason to take a second look at the @entity19			2
" what latinos want from candidates ? respect how about @entity56 or @entity57 ? two other @entity25 republicans who are generating vp buzz are @entity61 gov. @entity56 and @entity62 gov. @entity57			1
@entity56 is a gun - toting conservative and the first @entity37 governor in @entity27 history , but she has actually clashed with fellow @entity37 in @entity61 because she wants to reverse a state law allowing illegal immigrants to get drivers licenses			1
" giving licenses to people who are here illegally is wrong and overwhelmingly unpopular , " @entity56 has argued			2
@entity57 is a budget - cutting , government - shrinking @entity19 , but he favors abortion rights , which could be a drawback as a @entity19 running mate			1
and though he 's @entity37 , he does n't speak @entity75			0
why older @entity33 matter in election @entity77 , the first @entity37 @entity27 attorney general , says a @entity25 at the top of the ticket may help lure @entity37 voters , but not a @entity81			2
" i do n't think it would make that much of a difference , " @entity77 told @entity1			0
@entity77 : economic policies will discourage @entity37 , not voter id laws experience is key , @entity77 said			0
@entity2 , @entity56 and @entity57 all were elected to their posts a little more than 18 months ago			1
" i think governor @entity18 is better suited looking for someone to join him on the ticket who could be president on @entity91 , " @entity77 said			2
still , a @entity18 source points out to @entity1 that some states may be so close on @entity94 that a @entity37 running mate could make the difference			2
it 's not just states with well - known @entity37 populations like @entity61 , @entity99 and @entity62 that matter			1
battleground states such as @entity101 and @entity102 , where the @entity37 populations doubled in the past 10 years , could decide the next president			0
one enormous challenge in picking a @entity37 running mate is that hispanic - americans are very diverse			0
in the @entity37 community -- each poses risks for potential culture clashes			0
two - thirds of @entity37 in the @entity27 are of @entity109 descent , and a much smaller percentage , about 4 % , are @entity117			0
" it 's very different			0
it 's coming from different countries , different languages			0
it does n't mean we 're going to be monolithic or vote together , " said @entity45 , the @entity19 strategist			2
some @entity37 politicians and strategists argue that @entity37 are a natural constituency for the @entity19 -- not the @entity28 party			2
many @entity37 voters tend to be fiscally and socially conservative , they say			0
' sleeping giant ' latino vote yet to awaken the need for outreach @entity45 , like other @entity19 strategists , said the source of the decades - old @entity19 problem among @entity25 voters is that the party historically did little to no outreach			1
that has changed in recent years , but the fight has hampered efforts over immigration reform , which many @entity25 voters perceive as anti-latino			0
@entity18 's stance on illegal immigration during the @entity19 primary battle turned particularly strident , which @entity19 @entity37 strategists worry wo n't exactly pull voters to the @entity19			1
while @entity19 @entity37 such as @entity77 and @entity45 disagree over whether a @entity37 running mate would really help @entity18 with @entity37 voters , they do agree it would be , when it comes to inclusiveness , an extremely important gesture			1
and it may help republicans with @entity33 in the long run			0
" if governor @entity18 makes a decision that one of the people you mentioned should be with him on the ticket , and if governor @entity18 were to win in november , i mean there would be a great deal of pride in the @entity25 community in having that person being in that position , " said @entity77 .			0

beyond @entity2 , other @entity33 could be @entity18 's vice presidential pick
@entity174 . @entity56 of @entity61 and @entity57 of @entity62 are *possibilities*
@entity19 presidential candidates have historically had bad luck courting @entity33
