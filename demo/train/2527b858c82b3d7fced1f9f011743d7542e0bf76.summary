-- there is an old adage which goes something like this : " the cheap man always pays more in the long run			1
" @entity7 analyzed the cost of ownership across the 300 models in their database			1
@entity7 magazine recently reached a similar conclusion when it announced the results of a study that compared the cost of ownership of more than 300 cars			1
@entity7 noted that a car with a cheaper sticker price can often cost consumers more in the long run when compared to a higher - priced alternative			1
the report , which appeared in @entity7 ' @entity25 , was based on a comparison of the 300 models in the @entity7 database			1
in short , the report concluded that a car 's sticker price is one of many factors that should be taken into account when trying to decide between two cars in the same class			1
for example , at about $ 17,500 , a @entity35 is priced $ 5,000 less than a @entity37			0
but when factoring in the total costs of ownership for each vehicle , the @entity35 could cost drivers about $ 3,000 more to own over the first five years , according to the study			2
and the purchase price of a @entity44 is about $ 3,000 more than a @entity45 -- but the @entity47 's total cost of ownership is an extra $ 6,500 over those five years			2
the study took into account such factors as depreciation , fuel costs , interest paid on the car loan , insurance , maintenance , repair costs and sales tax			1
online subscribers to @entity60 can compare the costs for one , three , five and eight years of ownership			0
" we think this information is valuable for consumers who have shopped around , and settled on a couple of different cars they like , and then have to decide on one or the other , " noted @entity63 , @entity7 ' deputy editor , autos			2
" we 're giving this information to the consumer to use as a tool to help them make that decision , a tie - breaker , if you will			0
" if they 're trying to decide between a @entity80 and @entity81 , for example , they can go to our web site and find out which one will cost less to own over that five - year period			0
and in this particular case , the answer would be the @entity81 -- which was one of the least expensive cars to own of all the cars evaluated in our survey			0
" depreciation was factored into the estimates based on the assumption that the vehicle will eventually be traded in when buyers make their next car purchase			2
" depreciation is the factor that accounts for the highest cost of ownership , " @entity63 explained			1
" @entity91 accounts for 48 percent of the cost of ownership over the first five years			2
" different models depreciate faster , and more significantly , than others			0
in order to calculate depreciation for this owner - cost comparison , @entity7 started with the price that a typically - equipped model generally sells for			1
if a particular model often sells at a largely - discounted price that was also factored in			0
consumer reports then deducted the wholesale trade - in value of the car at the end of the period , based on data from their @entity117 , @entity63 explained			2
in those cases when @entity7 did n't have depreciation data for a new model , it used estimates based on comparable vehicles			1
the @entity124 the second - biggest factor in cost - of - ownership , after depreciation , is fuel costs , which account for 21 percent of the total ownership costs			1
" fuel economy can really make a big difference , " @entity63 said			0
" if you have a car that gets 25 miles per gallon , and another car that gets 19 miles per gallon , that 's a potential difference of thousands of dollars over five years , if you 're driving 12,000 miles a year			0
" @entity7 calculated fuel costs by assuming that the vehicles would be driven 12,000 miles a year -- the average annual mileage reported by those who responded to @entity7 ' annual reader survey			1
consumer reports then applied the national average price of regular gas as of december 2007 or , if applicable , the price of premium or diesel fuel			0
fuel costs were an especially big factor with @entity150 , the comparison revealed			1
drivers who buy a @entity152 could pay more than $ 10,000 to fill up the tank over a five - year period , for example			0
but the fuel costs for a similar - sized , more fuel - efficient @entity157 would be $ 2,000 less during that period			1
@entity7 ' comparison also concluded that interest paid on car loans accounts for about 12 percent of five - year ownership costs			1
that figure is based on a five - year loan , with a 15 percent down payment , using the average interest rate of 6.86 percent reported by @entity166 in december 2007			2
auto insurance accounts for about 11 percent of total ownership costs over five years , according to the @entity7 comparison			1
car insurance costs can vary depending on several factors such as the driver 's age , location , and driving record			0
auto insurance costs , in some cases , dramatically boosted the ownership costs of models that otherwise boasted reasonable ownership costs			2
as an example , @entity63 compared the difference in auto insurance rates for @entity184 and a similarly - priced @entity185			0
" insurance for the @entity35 can cost you $ 2,500 a year or more , based our 2007 figures , " notes @entity63			0
" meanwhile , the annual car insurance rates for the @entity185 can cost as little as $ 900			0
" maintenance & repairs surprisingly , maintenance and car repairs account for only four percent of the cost of ownership , @entity63 said			1
the maintenance and repair cost figures used in @entity7 ' cost of ownership comparison were based on information gleaned from more than a million respondents in its annual @entity203			1
one notable conclusion reached in the @entity7 study is that @entity208 models have relatively high maintenance and repair costs -- primarily due to maintenance alone , even though @entity208 owners reported excellent reliability			1
the @entity214 racks up an average of $ 2,300 in maintenance and repair in the first five years			0
meanwhile , owners of a comparable @entity219 can expect to pay only half that much			0
another interesting tidbit discovered in the comparison is that the @entity222 is the most expensive vehicle on average for five and eight years when it comes to maintenance and repairs , costing about $ 2,000 in the fifth year alone			2
meanwhile , the comparable @entity228 costs only $ 600 in that year to maintain and repair			0
some might be surprised to hear that the sales tax on the purchase price of the vehicle accounts for as much of the cost of ownership as maintenance and repairs			1
for its study , @entity7 used the national average of 4.83 percent in 2007			2
with hybrid cars being a hot topic in the auto industry , @entity7 was also interested in the cost of owning one of those fuel - sipping vehicles			1
the report concluded that @entity245 hybrid actually costs less to own than similar conventional models			2
specifically , the sale price of a @entity245 is about $ 7,500 higher than a similarly - sized @entity248 , but the total cost of ownership over five years is almost $ 2,000 less - due primarily to its much lower fuel costs , although the amount of depreciation was a factor as well			1
@entity63 pointed to another interesting finding : " there are some vehicles , namely @entity259 , that are very inexpensive to own over first five years , because all of the maintenance is paid for during that period , under the warranty , " he says			0
" but if we take it forward , the cost of maintenance and repairs over the next three years after that is going to be more expensive			0
