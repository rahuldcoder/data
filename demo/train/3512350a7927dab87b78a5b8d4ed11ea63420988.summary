-- @entity2 's civil war has been grinding on for nearly two years now , resulting in the deaths of more than 60,000 people , according to estimates from the office of the @entity7 human rights commissioner			1
more than 500,000 @entity2 have sought refuge in neighboring countries , and the @entity7 believes that number could top a million in the coming year			2
will the situation improve in 2013 , or will the bloody stalemate continue ? there have been encouraging signs lately for the opposition , which has made military gains against the regime of president @entity18			1
but some observers say @entity18 's grip on power remains strong			1
@entity0 's @entity22 and @entity23 , who have reported from inside @entity2 , analyze the conflict and what the future may hold			1
will the rebels defeat the regime ? @entity23 : i think there 's very little doubt that will happen			1
it 's not going to be one day in which there 's a decisive changing of the flags over a building in @entity38 and then the whole country turns 180 degrees in terms of its government			2
but there have been weeks now of consistent bad news for the regime			0
... that affects not only how people feel inside the regime 's inner circle , it affects how their sponsors feel			2
and , of course , it boosts morale for the rebels as well			0
so that real sense of momentum has been in place for months			0
it 's beginning to nip around the capital , and i do n't think any observer at this point thinks that the @entity18 government really has a chance in terms of retaining long - term power over the country			1
will @entity18 stay and fight until the end as he has said ? or will he go ? @entity22 : the rebels have said that they wo n't rest until @entity18 is completely gone ; they wo n't negotiate with them			1
but he 's showing no signs of leaving whatsoever			0
perhaps there are early indications that @entity18 does realize that he can not hold on to complete power as he has in the past			1
so perhaps what we 're seeing is the regime entering a new phase now where , rather than fight to hold on to everything , they 're fighting to have a better negotiating position in the future			1
@entity23 : the question really is how messy is that final stand of @entity18 actually going to be ? you 'll see pockets of these regime forces , particularly in the north , being left to their own devices			1
... the real problem of course is going to be how does the rebel militia , how do these disparate groups deal with these @entity98 military prisoners once they 've actually taken them into custody ? if @entity18 is overthrown , then what ? @entity23 : there will be a period of definitely chaos , warlordism perhaps , and sort of a vacuum whilst the armed groups who won the rebellion struggle for some degree of control over territory			1
i do n't really agree with the more dramatic visions of a nightmare future in @entity2 that 's something between " @entity116 " and the @entity117			1
i think it 's going to be a much more watered - down version of that			0
i think there 's an optimism , perhaps amongst many @entity2 , that they are educated , moderate in terms of the @entity125 values they have			1
and remember also , this was n't really a rebellion started over @entity125 principles			0
it is not @entity131 or @entity132			0
this was about trying to reject what they saw as a corrupt and repressive regime			0
... it 's classic in these situations , once the major battle is finished , for world attention to radically drift elsewhere onto the next crisis			0
but that will be the moment when @entity2 needs help at its most			2
it will be the moment where the @entity2 finally expect the @entity146 to actually step in now that the complicated issue of who 's arming who and who 's fighting who has been put aside			1
what kind of help will @entity2 need ? @entity22 : the economy in @entity2 is completely destroyed , and it 's going to take years to rebuild			1
so any notion that there can be a quick turnaround in 2013 is fiction			0
what we 're going to see in 2013 are large numbers of displaced people , millions internally inside the country			0
thousands , tens , possibly hundreds of thousands of people without shelter , their homes have been destroyed			0
large areas of @entity38 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 have been destroyed , people without homes			0
and they 're going to be desperate for food			0
@entity23 : i think once the majority of the violence ends , once the nuts and bolts of the civil war are behind them , then food , utilities will come back reasonably quickly because of the nature of where @entity2 is and who it 's bordered by			1
the real question though is , how do you rebuild a country where so many districts of so many of its cities have already been flattened in many ways ? i mean , two or three months ago , @entity173 was in pieces , really struggling to keep anything going			2
@entity22 : you have this whole opposition that has n't even engaged yet with the opposition outside of the country and the opposition that 's fighting there			1
so to see how they 're going to get together and govern together is very difficult			0
... any sort of sense of these opposition groups want to coalesce around democracy , those are not the indications we have at the moment			0
they 're talking about " we wo n't stop until we get rid of @entity18			2
" these are not people who are showing a great ability to compromise so far			0
how will the world respond or help or engage with the new @entity2 ? @entity23 : i think , in many ways , the process of that is under way , with the @entity223 trying to influence a government in exile ( and ) many opposition figures gathering in @entity227 or @entity228 to try and work out how that government would look like			1
but the problem is that might not relate to the daily struggles people are facing on the ground inside @entity2 after what would be a two - year long war			2
and bridging that gulf between the men in suits in five - star hotels ... and people on the ground who may be starving or missing the roof of their house from shelling is going to be the enormous challenge			0
@entity22 : distrust is endemic region - wide			2
the distrust of the @entity223 and @entity250 is deep - rooted in the culture in @entity2 already from 40 years of @entity18 rule , from watching what 's happened in other @entity255 countries , from hearing what radical islamists say what the @entity146 is trying to do with @entity125			1
all these things have been fomenting in the background			0
and now you have a scenario where the @entity146 has n't come to the aid of the @entity2 , so people are deeply angry			2
i do n't think we 're going to find friends quickly in @entity2			0
we 're certainly not going to win trust there quickly			0
and that 's going to make whatever we want to see -- the international community wants to see happen in @entity2 -- that 's going to make it much , much harder to achieve			1
more : inside a marriage destroyed by war more : @entity2 's underground tv more : is an endgame in sight ? more : family hids in underground ' prison '			2

@entity0 's @entity22 and @entity282 examine what the future may hold for @entity2
@entity23 : ' very little doubt ' the rebels will defeat the regime of @entity18
@entity22 : it will take years to rebuild the country 's *infrastructure* , economy
