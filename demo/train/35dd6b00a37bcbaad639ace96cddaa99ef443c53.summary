@entity0 , @entity1 -- dueling rallies took place monday involving a former @entity6 police officer who was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of an unarmed passenger			1
several hundred people gathered in this suburban community , some 25 miles northeast of @entity10 , with supporters of former officer @entity12 joined by critics , who said they were calling for justice for his victim , @entity12			1
the @entity0 branch of the @entity21 closed early monday because of the rallies , and all cases that were scheduled to be heard monday afternoon were postponed			1
some gas stations and a restaurant in the area also opted to close down for the day			1
from the air , the crowd appeared to be mostly peaceful , although banners revealed a sharp divide			1
" @entity32 , " proclaimed one large banner , held aloft by several people			2
other banners proclaimed support for police			2
" @entity36 , " some said			2
the justice for @entity12 supporters started their demonstration across the street but then moved onto the sidewalk in front the courthouse where the @entity36 supporters were demonstrating			1
there was some shouting between the two sides			2
police in riot gear placed metal barriers to keep the two sides apart			2
the two groups appeared evenly matched in size			1
police said at its peak , there appeared to be about 300 people at the event			2
they said there were no arrests			1
" the crowd has been vocal but very cooperative , " @entity0 police lt. @entity60 said			1
" there were no acts of violence			2
it actually went very well on both sides			2
" the crowds dispersed after about four hours			1
the @entity0 police department called in most of its police personnel and civilian staff for duty , and the @entity74 helped provide security			2
some area departments helped direct traffic			2
@entity36 , who is white , was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the 2009 shooting death of @entity80 , an unarmed black man who was on a train platform at the @entity83 station in nearby @entity84			1
the area gets its name from the apricot and cherry orchards that abounded there more than a century ago			0
supporters of @entity36 say the killing was a " tragic mistake " and say they called the rally to show support for police			1
they helped spread word for the rally through @entity97			0
" anyone who supports @entity101 and our @entity102 may attend , " said a post on the @entity97 page			0
" this is a peaceful rally to show our support for @entity106 , his family and our law enforcement officers			0
" it added , " this rally is not about inciting violence , destruction , intolerance , hatred , racism , riots or to upset the @entity107			0
" but organizers of the counter-rally say they were standing up for justice for @entity80 and against racism			0
they said in a news release they want to make clear that " justice means that @entity80 's killer , @entity36 , stays in jail and they throw away the key			0
" the website for the @entity128 added , " @entity12 was a young @entity129 returning home by way of the @entity83 station after celebrating the @entity133			1
this was the only excuse the cop needed to end @entity80 's life execution - style			0
maybe @entity138 was too loud , too proud , too black			1
maybe he was too calm during the taunts of the police			0
or maybe it was for nothing at all			0
" @entity36 faces two to four years in prison at his scheduled august 6 sentencing			0
he remains in the @entity146			0
the judge could also impose an additional term of three , four or 10 years because a firearm was used in the crime			0
although police said they were prepared for possible clashes , some people in this normally placid town were not unduly concerned that the rallies might get out of control , even though protests after the verdict in nearby @entity84 led to the arrest of 78 people			0
" even though i do n't think it 's the best idea , because i think it 's inflammatory , it 's people 's right , " said @entity161			0
" i work across the street from the @entity21 , and i 'm not concerned at all			0
" another man , who did n't give his name to @entity2 affiliate @entity169 , said that @entity0 " is not known for getting outrageous types of demonstrations			1
" the january 1 , 2009 , shooting of the 22 - year - old @entity80 was captured on a bystander 's cell phone video camera			1
the video was widely circulated on the internet and on news broadcasts			0
the video showed @entity36 pulling his gun and fatally shooting @entity80 in the back as another officer knelt on the unarmed man			1
