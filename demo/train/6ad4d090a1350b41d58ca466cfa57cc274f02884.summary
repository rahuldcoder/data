@entity0 -- the @entity3 official in charge of investigating fraud in @entity6 said monday he is carrying out a third audit to see if it might determine what happened to $ 6.7 billion in cash that was flown into @entity6 eight years ago and is now missing			1
" it has not been properly accounted for , " said @entity11 , special inspector general for @entity6 reconstruction			2
the money -- which belonged to @entity6 -- was part of a sum of $ 20 billion that was shipped into war - torn @entity18 in bricks of hundred - dollar bills			1
they were shrink - wrapped and stored in the @entity23 to pay for reconstruction			0
" our job as auditors is to find out how that was used , whether it was wasted or fraudulently misused , as we fulfill our mandate to get to a conclusory answer , " he said			0
@entity11 blamed the system that existed then			0
" the system was too loose and unregulated in 2003 and 2004 , " he said			1
" billions of dollars being flown into , effectively , a war zone ; an insurgency exploding into a civil war ; and fairly continuous turnover in government ministers and ministry personnel presented an atmosphere that some have described as @entity40 - like and i think that 's a fair description			0
" @entity11 said he did not want to speculate on who the potential criminals might be , then added , " but this money was delivered to @entity6 control , and we have in the past had a number of cases reported to us about interim ministers who did steal			1
" during 2003 and 2004 , he said , the money was under the aegis of the @entity52 , the entity created by the @entity3 to govern @entity6 after the fall of the regime of @entity55			1
afterward , @entity11 said , the @entity56 and the fledgling @entity6 government shared responsibility for safeguarding some of the money ; it was the @entity56 that asked him to investigate the whereabouts of the cash			1
a @entity56 spokesman contacted by @entity1 said the investigation found that " all of these funds remained under the control of the government of @entity6 at all times			0
" the money came from the sale of @entity6 oil , and was diverted by international sanctions and stored at a @entity71 facility in the @entity3 before being shipped to @entity6			2
though it was never @entity3 taxpayer money , @entity3 may still be on the hook for some of it			0
@entity6 officials have told @entity11 they may sue to reclaim the lost money , and they may have a case , said rep. @entity79 , @entity80 , the former chairman of the @entity81			2
" the truth of the matter is , the @entity82 said to the @entity3 , ' you are now entrusted with this money ; you have a fiduciary responsibility for the @entity6 people to use it for their benefit , ' " @entity79 said			2
" and now we ca n't account for $ 6.7 billion			1
" the @entity6 embassy in @entity0 did not respond to suggestions that @entity6 officials may have stolen some of the money , but a high - ranking @entity6 official said the inspector general 's report has shown that " the @entity3 failed to put in place accountable and transparent financial controls to safeguard @entity6 funds			1
" already , fraud and abuse have been uncovered and a number of convictions obtained , @entity11 said			0
he predicted that , before the matter is closed , there will be more prosecutions .			0

@entity11 's job is to try to find out what happened to $ 6.7 billion in missing funds
the money belonged to @entity6 , but @entity3 taxpayers might be on the hook
" the system was too loose and unregulated in 2003 and 2004 , " @entity11 says
