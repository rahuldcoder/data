-- the man they call the " wizard of @entity4 " has got a master apprentice			0
@entity7 champion trainer @entity6 has a reputation as a brilliant tutor of horses , but his most prized protege is now his eldest son , @entity12			1
the pair galloped into the history books last season as the first father and son -- in the role of trainer and jockey -- to win @entity22 's @entity21 , one of the world 's most famous flat races , with @entity26			1
" it works well , " @entity12 , who is his father 's first - choice jockey , told @entity0 's @entity28			1
" we both discuss what way we 're going to ride the horse and it does n't always go to plan -- it usually does n't -- but when it does it is great			2
" @entity12 is lean , rosy - cheeked and softly - spoken -- and modest too			2
the 20 - year - old rode his first winner , trained by his father , at @entity38 in 2009 just days after his 16th birthday			2
since then the @entity6 father - and - son combination has claimed high - profile victories in @entity22 , @entity7 , the @entity42 and @entity43 on celebrated horses including @entity26 and @entity45			1
" i suppose @entity12 has never known anything else since he was a baby , " said @entity6 , surveying the @entity4 yard tucked away in the heart of the @entity7 countryside in @entity49			1
" he probably knows how we think better than anybody			0
he knows when it goes wrong too -- he 's the first to admit it			0
" @entity6 learnt his trade from his own father , a farmer and small - scale trainer in @entity58 , @entity7 , before becoming a jockey , who dabbled in training on the side			1
the 44 - year - old was @entity7 's amateur champion jockey but it was his knack of training horses that saw him snapped up by @entity67 , @entity7 's global breeding and training powerhouse , in 1995			1
he has been @entity7 's champion trainer since 1998 and @entity72 champion trainer four times , guiding great horses such as @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			1
with such a prestigious brand to protect , not to mention family honor , does @entity6 treat his son differently ? " no , i do n't think so , " answered @entity6 in a straightforward manner			1
" he 's seen it all and heard it all good and bad			0
" it 's obviously a much closer relationship as we all live together but it 's more or less the same			0
" @entity12 agrees that he is not treated any differently by his father to the other jockeys charged with riding potential winners home			2
" there 's always a little bit of pressure , " he explained			0
" but i like pressure because when the pressure 's on it means you 'll be sensible			0
" dynasty in safe hands the pressure just might increase on @entity12 at some point in the future			0
as well as being his father 's favored jockey , @entity6 has named him as his potential successor			1
" i 'd be delighted , " said @entity6			0
" he 'd have to be finished riding at that stage but those things are a long way down the road			0
" we 'll look forward to it when it does happen			0
" at least @entity12 does not have to worry about sustaining the @entity6 dynasty alone			1
the 20 - year - old is the eldest of four children and @entity6 -- whose wife @entity117 was also a trainer -- already has them all riding out to exercise the horses			2
no wonder @entity4 has a reputation for breeding future stars of the turf -- and the training yard .			0

the *rising* star of champion trainer @entity6 's stable is his own son @entity12
the pair are the first father - and - son to win the @entity21 as trainer and jockey
@entity12 jokes their plans " do n't always go to plan " but the pair have had great success
@entity6 says @entity12 could one day take over training at the prestigious @entity67 stable
