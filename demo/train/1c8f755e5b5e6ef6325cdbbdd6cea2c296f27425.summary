-- @entity1 -- a tropical disease with a funny name that packs a wallop like having your bones crushed -- has finally taken up residence in the @entity8			0
ever since the first local transmission of chikungunya was reported in the @entity12 late last year , health officials have been bracing for the arrival of the debilitating , mosquito - borne virus in the @entity8			1
just seven months after the first cases were found in the @entity17 , the @entity15 reported the first locally acquired case of chikungunya in @entity20			1
even though chikungunya is not on the @entity25 list , 31 states and two @entity8 territories have reported cases of the disease since the beginning of the year			1
but only @entity29 and the @entity30 reported locally acquired cases			2
all the other cases were travelers who were infected in countries where the virus was endemic and were diagnosed upon returning to the @entity8			1
that ended thursday , when the @entity15 reported a man in @entity20 , who had not recently traveled outside the country , came down with the illness			1
as of right now , the @entity20 @entity40 confirmed there are at least two cases			1
one case is in @entity44 and the other is in @entity46			0
its arrival did not surprise the chair of the @entity50			1
" it was just a matter of when			0
we are prepared in the @entity54 and have been prepared for some time to deal with chikungunya , " @entity52 said			2
" from what i am seeing , i 'm sure there are more cases out there that we do n't know about			2
it 's really a matter of time			0
" the @entity15 is working closely with the @entity20 @entity40 to investigate how the patient came down with the virus			1
the @entity15 will also monitor for additional locally acquired @entity8 cases in the coming weeks and months			2
the virus , which can cause joint pain and arthritis - like symptoms , has been on the @entity8 public health radar for some time			1
usually about 25 to 28 infected travelers bring it to the @entity8 each year			0
but this new case represents the first time that mosquitoes themselves are thought to have transferred the disease within the continental @entity8 " the arrival of chikungunya virus , first in the tropical @entity12 and now in the @entity8 , underscores the risks posed by this and other exotic pathogens , " said @entity76 , chief of @entity15 's @entity77			1
" this emphasizes the importance of @entity15 's health security initiatives designed to maintain effective surveillance networks , diagnostic laboratories and mosquito control programs both in the @entity8 and around the world			2
" the virus is not deadly , but it can be extremely painful , with symptoms lasting for weeks			1
those with weak immune systems , such as the elderly , are more likely to suffer from the virus ' side effects than those who are healthier			2
about 60 % to 90 % of those infected will have symptoms , says @entity76			2
people infected with chikungunya will often have severe joint pain , particularly in their hands and feet , and can also quickly get very high fevers			0
the good news , said dr. @entity107 , an infectious diseases expert with @entity108 in @entity109 , is that the @entity8 is more sophisticated when it comes to controlling mosquitoes than many other nations and should be able to keep the problem under control			0
" we live in a largely air - conditioned environment , and we have a lot of screening ( window screens , porch screens ) , " @entity115 said			0
" so we can separate the humans from the mosquito population , but we can not be completely be isolated			0
" mosquito - borne virus worries @entity15 @entity1 was originally identified in @entity125 in the 1950s			1
then about 10 years ago , chikungunya spread to the @entity127 and @entity128 , and a few years later an outbreak in northern @entity130 sickened about 200 people			0
now at least 74 countries plus the @entity8 are reporting local transmission of the virus			1
the ecological makeup of the @entity8 supports the spread of an illness such as this , especially in the tropical areas of @entity20 and other @entity141 states , according to the @entity15			2
the other concern is the type of mosquito that carries the illness			0
unlike most mosquitoes that breed and prosper outside from dusk to dawn , the chikungunya virus is most often spread to people by @entity149 and @entity151 albopictus mosquitoes , which are most active during the day , which makes it difficult to use the same chemical mosquito control measures			1
these are the same mosquitoes that transmit the virus that causes dengue fever			0
the disease is transmitted from mosquito to human , human to mosquito and so forth			0
a female mosquito of this type lives three to four weeks and can bite someone every three to four days			0
@entity115 and other health experts recommend people remember the mosquito - control basics : -- use bug spray if you are going out , especially in tropical or wooded areas near water			1
-- get rid of standing water in empty plastic pools , flower pots , pet dishes and gutters to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds			0
-- wear long sleeves and pants .			0

the first local cases of chikungunya arrived in @entity20
the mosquito - borne virus creates painful arthritis - like symptoms
the @entity50 chair says more cases likely
