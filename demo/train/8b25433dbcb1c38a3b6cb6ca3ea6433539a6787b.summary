-- two lawmakers have joined the debate over the name of the @entity5 football team , writing a letter to the @entity7 calling for a name change and threatening to hold hearings on the subject			1
the name @entity5 is " an insult to @entity22 , " according to the two lawmakers , sen. @entity13 , @entity15 - @entity14 and chairwoman of the @entity17 , and rep. @entity18 , @entity19 , who is a member of the @entity20			1
" this term does not honor -- but rather disparages -- @entity28 people and tribes , " they wrote in their letter to @entity7 commissioner @entity26			2
" the @entity7 can no longer ignore this and perpetuate the use of this name			2
" @entity13 said the advocacy of the @entity34 , including a video made by the organization , was part of what prompted her letter to league officials			2
@entity7 officials " have heard from the leading representatives of @entity22 in our country , " she said			1
" so are they going to change the name , or are they going to continue to use an offensive name ? " the owner of the @entity5 , @entity48 , has defended the name and vowed to keep it			1
@entity51 , a senior vice president with the team , had the following response to the lawmakers : " with all the important issues @entity34 has to deal with such as a war in @entity57 to deficits to health care , do n't they have more important issues to worry about than a football team 's name ? " and in an apparent dig at @entity18 , he added , " given the fact that the name of @entity19 means " red people " in @entity69 , this request is a little ironic			1
" the team also pointed to letters from @entity5 fans of @entity74 descent who support the name , such as @entity76 , who said he went to every game this season			0
" i 'm proud of being a redskin			0
i 'm proud of being a @entity74 , " he said in an interview			0
the @entity5 team plays honorably ; they fight hard , as did the ' redskins ' of the past			0
" he also objected to members of @entity34 getting involved in the issue			0
@entity13 said she was ready to make an issue of the tax - exempt status the @entity7 enjoys and plans to push for @entity93 hearings on the subject			1
" with our tight economic budget , we ca n't afford to have tax breaks going to organizations that basically have terminologies that are offensive to the @entity101 people , " she told @entity0			0
the @entity7 did not have an immediate reaction to the letter from the lawmakers , but @entity26 was asked about the controversy 10 days ago			1
" let me remind you , this is a name of a football team that has had that name for 80 years , and has presented the name in a way that honored @entity22 , " he said			0
" we recognize that there are some that do n't agree with the name , and we have listened and respected that			0

two lawmakers urge the @entity7 to change the @entity5 name
