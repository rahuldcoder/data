-- two decades after pummeling @entity3 owners into submission with classic boxing title " @entity6 ! , " former heavyweight champion @entity1 is returning to the video game ring			1
a new @entity1 boxing game for the @entity9 is coming to @entity11 's @entity10 next month from @entity12 , and veteran players will note it bears more than a passing resemblance to the helium - voiced bruiser 's original interactive debut			1
the new arcade sports simulation stars a fictional scrapper named " @entity21 , " who must battle his way past 10 fighters to earn a shot at socking it to @entity1 himself			1
@entity12 ceo @entity28 recently told @entity29 that he used his own high school buddies as inspiration for these fighters			1
" @entity33 is a friend who was a bully , " he said			0
" @entity35 is another friend who was the first of my friends to have kids ; @entity40 [ @entity41 boxer ] is my best friend and lawyer			0
" additional sports celebrities you can box with will also be available for purchase from @entity12 , which creates custom apps for such personalities as @entity50 star @entity49 , @entity43 wide receiver @entity51 and his new teammate @entity52			1
some may find the as - yet - untitled game , which will cost 99 cents , a welcome waltz down memory lane			1
others might simply view it as a clever novelty			0
we ca n't help but wonder whether it underscores the app store 's brilliance or a fundamental tragic flaw			2
fans of the 1987 original may appreciate the ability to quickly recreate similar thrills anytime , anywhere on a portable device			0
some might even view the inclusion of @entity28 's friends as one man 's realization of a childhood dream			2
but game developers are n't as likely to be pleased by the principle it illustrates			0
today anyone can quickly and cheaply clone popular game titles on mobile handsets			2
these digital diversions can also be made much more convenient to access and less expensive to buy than official updates and remakes -- for example the recent " punch - out ! ! " for @entity85			0
the knock - offs are n't always as polished or enjoyable as proper updates			0
these quickie games also help drive prices down in a field where margins are already razor - thin , making it harder for actual license - holders to compete and invest in higher - quality game experiences			0
worse , such " homages " only add to the confusing glut of titles already available on the @entity9 and @entity99 , which are currently home to over 40,000 game titles			1
no matter how good or innovative an original game may be , it 's difficult for fans to discover it amid suffocating competition			2
this offers less incentive for game creators to raise the bar			0
@entity12 's game will naturally benefit from @entity1 's celebrity in addition to its bargain - bin price and nostalgic boxing action			1
but will the game really add to the boxer 's legacy ? or is it simply a novelty act designed to cash in on @entity1 's recent resurgence in fame ? only time will tell			1
in fairness , we admit to being intrigued at the prospect of lacing up the old virtual gloves again and delivering flying uppercuts to the face of a certain ear - biting pugilist .			0

@entity1 boxing @entity9 game will be availabe next month for 99 cents from @entity12
@entity135 's creator says he used his own high school buddies as inspiration for these fighters
@entity9 and @entity99 are home to over 40,000 titles
