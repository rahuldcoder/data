" @entity2 continue to successfully leverage their global brand , " @entity60 , senior manager in the @entity62 at @entity24 , said in a statement			2
" the new world - record seven - year shirt sponsorship deal with @entity65 will double the revenues the club receives from its shirt partner in the first season of the new deal in 2014/15			2
" this combined with new @entity49 broadcast deals from 2013/14 , which will deliver incremental distributions of between £ 20 million ( $ 31.7 million ) and £ 30 million ( $ 47.5 million ) per club , will help @entity2 push the two @entity10 clubs above them , for a top two ranking , " added @entity60			1
