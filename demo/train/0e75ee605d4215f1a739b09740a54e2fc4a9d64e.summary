-- we can spend the next few years beating ourselves up and debating the proposition that @entity3 saved @entity4 and @entity5 lost it			1
or we can get real and try to sort out what we can do now to protect @entity8 interests in a region that 's melting down			1
@entity4 was never the @entity8 's to win			1
that point -- along with lowered expectations and focused goals -- must be the basis of any new approach to the region			0
and here are three reasons			0
demography : there are two factors that nations -- even functional ones ( and @entity4 is not ) -- ca n't alter : what they are -- their demography ; and where they are -- their geography			1
@entity4 has been dealt an unhappy hand in both departments			1
there is , to be sure , a sense of @entity4 national identity			1
but at the same time the end of @entity36 's cruel rule -- for which the @entity8 is responsible -- opened up a @entity37 of sectarian tensions and expectations -- for which the @entity8 is partly responsible -- that have never been adequately addressed			1
in essence , the @entity8 overturned a brutal minority @entity43 rule and enabled @entity46 majority rule			2
the ins became the outs , and the outs the ins			0
and guess what ? despite several successful elections , $ 25 billion from the @entity8 to train and equip the @entity4 military , and another trillion in support of the @entity56 government , @entity4 never equitably distributed political and economic power			1
@entity43 became disenfranchised , angry and vulnerable to jihadi persuasions ; @entity46 sought to get even , get ahead and maintain a privileged position ; and @entity60 sought to protect their own interests and effectively create a separate governing authority			0
@entity4 these days is n't so much a nation as it is a collection of battling sectarian groups , each seeking advantage at the expense of the @entity4 state			1
geography : @entity4 's neighbors , particularly @entity71 and @entity72 , do not share @entity8 's vision of an equitably balanced and independent polity			1
each of them has its own vision			0
@entity4 has become a pawn in a regional competition between @entity43 and @entity46 and @entity80 and @entity81			2
@entity71 wants a weak , stable @entity4 not aligned with the @entity82 , under @entity46 influence			2
the @entity72 want @entity56 out and are happy that the militant group @entity85 in @entity4 and @entity86 may provide that opportunity , even as they fear the jihadists			2
they want @entity43 empowered and @entity71 disempowered			0
@entity90 has made its peace with the @entity4 @entity60 and hopes to get them to moderate the radical tendencies of those in @entity86 , but really has no answer to the @entity97 contagion			1
@entity98 is vulnerable to @entity97 too , but ca n't exercise much influence in @entity4			1
the regime of @entity102 is aligned with both @entity71 and @entity56 , and -- likely under @entity104 's encouragement -- has begun to use military force against @entity97 along the @entity86 - @entity4 border			1
all this regional maneuvering reflects the reality that the neighbors ' interests will continue to trump @entity8 's by virtue of their proximity , their influence in @entity4 , and the reality that @entity4 is more vital to them than it is to us			1
@entity86 : @entity4 ca n't be stabilized without dealing with @entity86			2
and to date , the @entity8 -- by default the only power that remotely has the capacity to alter the course of the civil war there -- has been unable and unwilling to do that			2
the @entity97 threat may prompt a review of the @entity5 administration 's @entity86 policy , but we should be under no illusions that @entity129 is ready to jump in with a comprehensive political , economic , and military strategy to end the conflict			1
indeed , the @entity8 will be faced with some tough choices			2
it may find itself in the odd position of ramping up support for the more moderate @entity43 rebels in @entity86 but also striking @entity97			2
that means we will be trying to weaken @entity102 on one hand , but indirectly strengthening him on the other by attacking a common enemy			2
under no circumstances should the @entity5 administration commit to trying to put two broken nations back together again			0
bottom line is that the real challenge is @entity97 , which is likely to remain ensconced in parts of @entity86 and @entity4			1
what should @entity5 do ? first let 's be clear about what he should n't do			0
the @entity8 needs to abandon any illusions that it can transform or find an easy way out of the situation			2
it is stuck in a region that it ca n't fix or leave			0
there is n't a single problem in this region that has a comprehensive or definitive solution			0
instead , the @entity8 should accept the reality that it will be dealing with outcomes , not happy endings , there			2
@entity4 may never be a unified polity , but it need not necessarily be a failed one			2
the question is , can we shape these outcomes to our advantage ? @entity3 tried to do too much ; @entity5 too little			0
is there a balance ? the @entity8 needs at least three different but related approaches : 1			2
sure , in the case of @entity71 , it 's like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop			0
but the @entity8 ca n't begin to deal with @entity97 on its own			1
@entity71 is the key external power in @entity4			0
and @entity90 , @entity98 and @entity72 have a stake in stopping @entity97 's advances			1
the @entity8 may have to accept the reality that the evil @entity102 is a hedge against @entity97 , even though his policies helped to facilitate its rise			1
think diplomacy first , then military force			0
you need the first to make the second effective			0
that coordination must try to produce a more acceptable political arrangement in @entity193 , with or without @entity56			0
without the @entity4 government regaining @entity43 support , @entity97 will continue to roll			1
and this means some new and more inclusive political arrangement in @entity193 to share power			0
forget democracy and making @entity4 whole			1
to bring @entity43 around and check @entity97 , we may have to not only concede influence to @entity71 but also to some pretty bad @entity43 , including former @entity36 supporters and insurgents			1
the @entity8 will need to do what it can to buck up the @entity4 military			1
this could easily lead to sending additional advisers , but under no circumstances should it involve the use of combat forces			1
we may well have to use airstrikes and drones against @entity97			0
and this is tricky , because it risks feeding jihadi sentiment			0
that 's why a new political arrangement is mandatory			0
but even without it , the @entity8 must face the reality that @entity97 -- with money , passports , and a base of operations -- will emerge as a threat to our friends in the region , to @entity229 and ultimately to us			1
we should n't run scared			0
@entity97 's own ideology will produce a counterreaction among @entity4 who will oppose its harsh , unforgiving ideology			1
indeed as the @entity234 points out , @entity97 is its own worst enemy			0
the region is littered with the remains of failed jihadi efforts , including @entity240 central			0
in 2013 , there were 17,800 global fatalities as a result of terrorist attacks			0
only 16 of those were @entity8			0
@entity246 is not a strategic threat to the homeland right now			0
but it may well require a coordinated counterterror effort with our regional and international partners to prevent it from becoming one .			0

@entity255 : debating what went *wrong* in @entity4 not useful ; protecting @entity8 interests now is
@entity4 is complex , he says , with sectarian groups at odds , neighbors with own interests
he says @entity8 must work with @entity4 's neighbors , even @entity102 , to halt @entity97 . democracy can wait
@entity255 : @entity8 must help right @entity4 military , but without combat forces . @entity271 is to check terror
