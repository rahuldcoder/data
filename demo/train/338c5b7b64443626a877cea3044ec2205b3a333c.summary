-- as alumni and friends of @entity5 descended on the @entity7 institution to celebrate homecoming , the school 's board of trustees met over the weekend to consider whether to offer students emergency shots of a vaccine against meningitis after seven cases of the potentially fatal disease occurred on campus			1
the final decision , to be made in concert with medical staff and university administrators , is expected sometime this week , said @entity20 , a spokeswoman for the @entity21			0
the sole meningococcal vaccine that targets meningitis group b , @entity24 , is made by @entity25			1
though it was approved this year in @entity27 and @entity28 , it has not been approved for use in the @entity30			1
" we have filed an @entity35 application for our @entity37 vaccine in the @entity30 , but have not yet come to an agreement on a pathway to licensure for this vaccine with regulatory authorities , " @entity25 spokeswoman @entity31 told @entity0 saturday in an e-mail			1
still , company officials have been coordinating with officials at @entity5 , the @entity21 and the state @entity44 about getting a vaccine to the school in @entity48 , she said			1
the @entity21 says it is considered " a safe vaccine			2
" @entity51 meningitis is a strain of the bacterial form of the disease that is rare in the @entity30			1
symptoms can include stiff neck , headache , fever , vomiting , rashes , sensitivity to light and confusion			0
untreated , the disease can lead to complications such as hearing impairment , brain damage , limb amputations and death			0
antibiotic treatment of the most common types of bacterial meningitis " should reduce the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15 % , although the risk remains higher among young infants and the elderly , " according to the @entity21			2
bacterial meningitis is an infection of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord , known as the meninges			2
in the @entity30 , about 4,100 cases of bacterial meningitis , including 500 deaths , occurred each year between 2003 and 2007 , the @entity21 says			1
what is meningitis ? " usually , when you see this kind of meningitis on the campus , it 's meningitis c , " said dr. @entity87 , professor of preventive medicine at @entity88 , in a telephone interview with @entity0			1
" this is very , very unusual			0
" @entity87 added that , in the @entity30 , @entity51 meningitis typically strikes infants , and only rarely adolescents and young adults			1
though the mechanism needed for health officials to administer an unapproved vaccine in the @entity30 is " very elaborate , " it would be justified in this case , he said			1
" if i were around the table with the board of trustees , i would be gently encouraging them to do this			0
" @entity5 's first reported case developed in a student who had returned to the campus after spring recess in march , according to the state health department			1

@entity21 : bacterial meningitis explainer meningitis can spread via the exchange of saliva and other respiratory secretions through kissing , coughing , sharing drinks and living in close quarters , such as in dormitories , according to the health department			2

but the disease is not wholly understood			0
cases of meningococcal disease in general -- including @entity51 -- have dropped in recent years to the lowest levels since the 1930s			2
" nobody knows why , " he said			0
and cases sometimes occur more frequently in @entity145			2
" we 've never understood that , either			0
" the @entity48 outbreak is also puzzling			1
" why this is occurring is not clear , but the trick everybody is working on is how to stop it , how to prevent further cases , " he said			0
if the board approves , as many as 8,000 undergraduate and graduate students at the school could be offered the vaccine			0
