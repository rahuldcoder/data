-- @entity2 's privacy problems have been in the news ... again			1
although complaints may have started deep in the blogosphere , even @entity4 has made them its cover story			0
in response , @entity2 announced a new privacy model to address complaints that it 's too darn hard to actually navigate privacy settings on @entity2			1
) it 's not yet clear whether @entity2 's changes will satiate the @entity15 ( let alone the rabid critics ) , but the conversations about privacy settings tend to emphasize only a fraction of the core concerns			1
@entity2 rightfully believes that it 's important to give users control over their settings , to empower them to make decisions about what 's accessible			1
but @entity2 can also be condescending , suggesting that they know what 's best for their users because they have so much data about them ( which they do )			1
unfortunately , @entity2 's data tells them a lot about what people do but little about why they do it			1
they know that people are n't quitting @entity2 , but that does n't mean that users are n't frustrated or concerned ( or would be if they understood what was happening )			2
do n't get me wrong -- the privacy settings are confounding even for the most experienced digerati and i 'm very glad that they 're addressing this fundamental issue			0
but in doing so , i hope that they realize that the main reason for so much public outrage goes beyond privacy settings			0
the issue is fundamentally about trust and informed consent			0
when people share information with @entity2 , they become vulnerable to @entity2			1
they trust @entity2 to respect their interests			2
@entity2 has the power to expose people in ways that make their lives really miserable			2
because of that power , it 's crucial that they stop telling users what 's best for them and start engaging in a more meaningful dialogue			0
changing things and then forcing users to opt out is manipulative			0
instead , they should be seeking informed consent -- actively working with users to help make sure that they understand what 's at stake in their choices			0
it is unacceptable for a company like @entity2 to trick people into " consenting " to make their data more visible than they might think that it is			1
people should be able to understand @entity2 's changes and have choices available that allow them to make appropriate decisions			1
when @entity2 changed its privacy settings in december , far too many people clicked on through without realizing that a few mouse clicks meant that they were exposing their status updates to the world			2
many people may know exactly how not - private their @entity2 profile or updates are			1
but do they ? i recommend using @entity92 to scan your privacy settings			0
keep in mind that " everybody " is more than the people searching for you on @entity2 -- this includes every company or individual who wants to use your information for any purpose			2
in many ways , it 's more accessible than simply posting something on a public website and waiting for @entity110 to find it			0
and keep in mind that " friends - of - friends " means more than the people that you 'd invite to a birthday party			1
i talked with a young woman who vowed that she 'd never friend her mother ; she did n't realize that if she friended her aunt and her aunt friended her mother than " friends - of - friends " included her mother			1
do people really know who is included in their " friends - of - friends ? " @entity2 does n't just need to fix its privacy settings			1
it needs to fix its attitude and repair its relationship with its users			0
@entity2 is n't just a space for users to share ; it is built on the backs of people and profits off of the data people entrust to them			1
an abusive relationship is simply unacceptable			0
@entity2 must go beyond paternalism and start empowering users to help guide the future of the service			2
it starts with committing to an opt - in approach to changes and developing features that allow users to have complete transparency as to how their data is exposed to , and used by , third parties			2
it then requires innovating ways to actively engage participants			0
@entity2 built a platform for mass sharing , but if it wants to change the world , it must also develop mechanisms for informed participation			0
with great power comes great responsibility .			0

@entity2 's data says what people do but little about why they do it
when people share info with @entity2 , they become vulnerable to @entity2
do people really know who is included in their " friends - of - friends ? "
