-- the coach of four - time major winner @entity2 has urged golf 's governing bodies to come to a quick decision on the proposed banning of anchored putting			1
@entity8 's rulemakers @entity9 ( @entity9 ) and the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , which governs the game in the @entity12 and @entity13 , announced in november they intend to ban the method of putting by which a club is anchored to a part of the body by 2016			1
the decision has been backed by the @entity19 , but @entity20 , commissioner of the lucrative @entity12 - based @entity21 , opposes the rule change which would essentially outlaw the controversial " belly putter "			1
@entity2 is one of a clutch of recent major winners who favor using the belly putter -- three of the last five majors have been won by a player using the technique			1
@entity2 ' coach @entity30 has called for a solution to be found soon in order to protect the integrity of the game			1
" they have to make a decision quickly , " @entity30 told @entity0 's @entity8			1
" @entity37 , who 's easily the best putter on the planet , got up and said to @entity20 , ' you 've got to make a decision now			2
" if we let this thing continue for three or four more years the guys that are still using the long putter are still going to be winning golf tournaments and then do we put a asterisk , is there a stigma attached to that			2
" the longer this keeps going and they still ca n't find a decision , a guy like @entity56 , does he practice and waste time away from his game to try and do something or does he just continue to do what he is really good at ? " @entity56 and fellow @entity12 @entity61 both used the anchored putting technique to win the @entity63 in 2011 and 2012 respectively			1
@entity30 joined @entity20 in questioning whether the method offered players an advantage over more conventional putting techniques			1
" none of the best putters in the world use a belly putter and i know from talking to guys like @entity2 , like @entity56 and @entity61 , i think they do feel a little bit that there 's a target on their back , " added @entity30			1
" i think it is going to be very hard to quantify with data an advantage that a belly putter gives players			1
" the @entity21 and the @entity19 and golf at a professional level is a sport absolutely , but it is also a business			1
" for me what @entity20 is trying to do is say to the governing bodies , this is just my opinion , that if you 're going to make decisions that affect the professional game you have to involve the professional game			0
" former world no. 1 @entity96 , who uses a traditional putter , also wants to see the issue put to bed			0
" i 'm a little tired of it , " 2010 @entity63 winner @entity96 told @entity0			0
" everybody should make a decision and we move on			0
all the speculation now is a little bit too much			0
" the @entity21 , the @entity9 , the @entity19 , they should sit down and make a decision together			2
" @entity108 , of @entity110 newspaper @entity109 , suggests the reintroduction of golf at the 2016 @entity113 means anchored putting will be banned , despite @entity12 resistance			1
" i think it 's clear where this is going , " said @entity108			0
" you ca n't get this far and then say , ' ok , as you were			0
' the putter is going to be banned			0
" the @entity113 is coming up , you ca n't have an anchored putter at the @entity113			2
it 's as simple as that			0
" according to @entity124 of @entity125 , the @entity21 will have to back down in order to avoid a division within the sport			2
" you ca n't have different rules , " @entity124 said			0
" they 're going to have to fall in line with whatever the @entity10 and @entity9 do			0
" it would be chaotic if the @entity21 wrote their own rule on this , which they 've never done			2
it would be a major departure			0

@entity2 ' coach calls for a decision on anchored putting
@entity21 spoke out against a ban on the technique , which could be outlawed
@entity30 says a delay on the decision could *damage* integrity of golf
@entity2 , @entity56 and @entity61 have all won recent majors using belly putter
