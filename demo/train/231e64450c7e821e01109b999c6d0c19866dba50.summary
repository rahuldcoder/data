it may be the most historic plane in the world : @entity4 , @entity4 for short			1
not familiar ? maybe you know its nickname			0
back in its heyday the sleek , blue and white airliner was called @entity10			0
this ai n't just any @entity10			0
@entity4 saw more historic events than any other -- ranging from the tragic to the hilarious			1
a national treasure , the airliner now sits in the @entity10 museum in @entity16 , @entity17			0
but you ca n't see it			0
it 's off limits to visitors			1
for many history buffs and aviation geeks , that 's a cryin ' shame			2
if things were different , visitors could walk down the same cabin aisles where @entity29 mournfully sat beside her husband 's casket en route from @entity33 to @entity34			1
you could stand in the exact spot where the only woman to preside over a presidential oath swore in @entity38 as commander - in - chief			1
examine with your own eyes the on - board suites that carried president @entity42 to @entity43 , where he cracked open @entity45 relations with @entity46			1
for more than 30 years , the 100 - ton plane transported some of the most powerful figures on the planet -- and once it even carried a history - making @entity52 intern named @entity53			2
yep , @entity4 has seen a few eyebrow - raising situations over the years			1
oh my , if only this plane could talk			0
" a person could justify that it 's the most important historical airplane in the world , " @entity10 historian @entity57 said on the phone , just a stone 's throw away from the jet			1
" it 's a place in history that moves			2
every time i get on board , that 's what i think about			2
" so what 's the problem ? why is this $ 36 million plane -- paid for by taxpayers -- shut away in a darkened hangar ? it 's ironic if you think about it			2
the plane perhaps most associated with politics has fallen victim to political gamesmanship			0
about 500 miles away , inside the bubble of @entity34 's @entity86 , political fighting triggered mandatory budget cuts called sequestration			1
the @entity10 ordered the museum to economize -- including temporarily closing the @entity90 where @entity4 is parked			1
buses that are required to transport visitors to @entity4 's special hangar are just too pricey			1
so they shut it down			0
" people are very disappointed , " says @entity96 of the @entity97			0
staffers are trying to determine whether to hold events marking the 50th anniversary of @entity103 's death this november			1
it 's bad timing , she admits			2
last year , @entity4 ranked among the museum 's most popular exhibits , drawing almost 90,000 visitors among the facility 's total attendance of 1.2 million			1
since the hangar doors closed in may , the jet 's visitors of course have plunged to zero			2
history has happened on this plane			0
and by stepping aboard @entity4 , visitors say they can imagine it all			1
they can imagine a newly sworn - in president @entity38 grabbing ahold of @entity103 's casket as he helped @entity123 staff pull it through the plane 's rear exit into the cabin			1
they can paint a mental picture of federal judge @entity130 swearing in @entity38 while a photographer snapped that famous image of @entity38 and a grief - stricken and stunned @entity29			1
" you can stand on that spot where president @entity29 's casket came in -- you think about the horror of what was going on and the shock of what happened , " said @entity57			1
" you can look forward toward the nose of the aircraft and know that 's where the transfer of power took place , and you can see where mrs. @entity29 sat near the body of her slain husband			2
sometimes i still get goosebumps			0
" you can imagine the pilot -- col. @entity151 -- as he took off from @entity33 to @entity34 , jetting to an unusually high 41,000 feet to guard against a possible second attack			0
" he did n't have any idea whether this was part of a large conspiracy , " his son , @entity153 told , the @entity154			0
" he was n't going to take any chances with a new president in the plane			0
'' imagine the dramatic scene a few hours later outside @entity34 at @entity162 as @entity103 's brother , attorney general @entity163 , " leaped up " a portable stairway to board the plane			1
rushing to console the first lady , @entity170 " pushed his way down " the aisle past president @entity38 " without saying a word , " wrote historian @entity166			1
an angry @entity38 " fumed that @entity29 would board the plane without even acknowledging him , " @entity166 claims in " the @entity173 , 24 hours after			1
" a few days after that , imagine the plane soaring high over @entity29 's funeral at @entity179 , as described by historian @entity180			2
saluting the fallen commander in chief , @entity4 tipped its wings before @entity153 " threw all his fuel controls on full and leaned into the wind " at a blistering 600 mph			1
awkward many associate the jet with @entity103 , but the plane was tied just as closely to his two successors , @entity38 and @entity42			1
in 1972 , @entity4 touched down in the world 's most populous nation , as @entity42 forged the first @entity45 ties with the @entity46			1
aboard the plane , a " burly " @entity42 aide " blocked the aisle " to keep staffers from following the president down the stairway to the tarmac , national security adviser @entity193 recalled			1
@entity42 did n't want anyone getting in the way of his historic photo op with @entity46 's premier			1
nine years later , imagine @entity42 sitting with ex-presidents @entity205 and @entity207 in the " relatively cramped tail section " of @entity4 , as @entity209 described it			1
they felt " somewhat ill at ease , " as they flew to the funeral of @entity215 president @entity214 , wrote @entity207 years later			0
and they certainly had their reasons -- especially @entity207 and @entity219			0
just five years earlier @entity207 , a @entity220 , had delivered a stinging election defeat to the @entity222 's @entity219			0
tension also ran high among staffers aboard the flight			0
they endured long waits to use the lavatories and got upset about who received bigger cuts of steak at dinner , according to author @entity233			0
then @entity42 " surprisingly eased the tension " with " courtesy , eloquence and charm , " @entity207 revealed in a memoir			1
aboard @entity4 , the two former enemies developed a camaraderie and then a friendship , wrote historian @entity242			2
' @entity243 ' @entity10 was designed for presidential multitasking , generations before the word was even invented			0
maybe the funniest example of this concept occurred aboard @entity4 at a campaign stop in 1964			2
@entity38 invited reporter @entity250 and two colleagues to an impromptu press conference in the plane 's bedroom , according to @entity250 's book , " the way he was			1
" the president -- who wanted to change clothes after giving a speech in the hot sun -- astonished the reporters when he " removed his shirt and trousers , " while answering their questions about the economy			0
@entity38 then " shucked off his underwear " and kept talking while " standing buck naked and waving his towel for emphasis			2
" another time on the jet , @entity250 wrote , @entity38 was sitting and talking with his legs crossed when an " airman who served as @entity38 's valet " kneeled before the president and " quickly removed one of @entity38 's shoes and socks , bathed the naked foot then put on a fresh sock and replaced the shoe			1
" neither the valet nor the president ever acknowledged each other , and @entity38 did n't miss a beat of his conversation			2
the plane carried @entity38 's body after his death in 1973 , just as it had @entity29			1
twenty - one years later , it ferried @entity42 's casket back home to @entity293			1
@entity4 's legacy also includes a footnote labeled , " @entity53			1
" the former @entity123 intern who later became a central figure in the impeachment of president @entity299 flew aboard the plane as a @entity302 staffer on a tour of @entity305 nations in the ' 90s			0
by that time , the aging @entity4 had been demoted as a second - tier presidential aircraft and was reserved as a backup			2
the @entity10 introduced a military version of the @entity311 -- much bigger than @entity4 -- into the @entity4 fleet beginning in 1990			2
@entity4 carried about 48 passengers and crew , while the new bigger jets held more than twice as many : 102 passengers and crew with about 4,000 square feet of floor space to roam around in			1
" it was such a quantum leap forward in @entity10 's capabilities , " said @entity57			0
" with the added ability of inflight refueling , it freed up @entity10 to do whatever it needed to do			0
" by 1998 , @entity4 was done			2
then - vice president @entity324 honored the plane 's legacy by hosting its final official flight -- a hop from @entity34 to @entity329 , @entity330 , before it traveled to the @entity10 museum in @entity17 a few months later			0
" if history itself had wings , it probably would be this very aircraft , " @entity324 said at the time			0
as this year 's 50th anniversary of the @entity29 assassination approaches , @entity4 's caretakers at the @entity10 museum have no idea how to plan for it			1
as @entity57 put it , " we 're just held in limbo right now			0
" it 's a mystery whether @entity343 will end sequestration in october -- or if even deeper cuts will follow			2
the @entity10 is already preparing for a worst - case scenario			0
at the @entity302 , @entity10 brass have no plans to change the current funding situation at the museum -- at least through october , said @entity10 lt. col. @entity351			0
after that , she said , " we do n't know what the new normal will look like in our current fiscal - constrained environment			0
" in the meantime , the @entity10 " will continue to take action to reduce spending " as a way to support " overseas contingency operations and preserve readiness , " @entity351 said			0
" it 's heartbreaking , " says rep. @entity361 , a @entity222 member of the powerful @entity362 who represents the museum 's district			0
" these are incredibly historic aircraft , " @entity361 said , which are inaccessible to visitors because of sequestration that he described as " shameful and outrageous			0
" @entity361 called on the @entity371 and president @entity372 to come to the table with a solution and break the deadlock			0
despite the closure of the museum 's @entity378 , the facility remains open seven days a week , and admission is free			0
but until funds appear -- or lawmakers in @entity34 can come together -- the world 's most historic plane will stay behind closed doors			1
@entity10 returns sequestration - grounded @entity386 to the sky			0

budget cuts make @entity390 , aka @entity4 , off limits
*expert* : it may be " the most important historical airplane in the world "
@entity4 served as a stage for several major historic events
it carried @entity103 's casket , hosted @entity38 's swearing in , and ferried @entity42 to @entity46
