-- it is one of the most passionate derbies in world football			2
not only do @entity6 and @entity7 share a city , they also share a stadium -- the @entity10 -- but as they prepare to meet for the first time this season the notoriously febrile atmosphere this enduring fixture generates might be significantly muted			1
the @entity15 authorities have ordered the closure of the @entity18 section of the stadium , where @entity6 's most vociferous fan congregate , in response to chanting aimed at @entity23 supporters in their game last weekend			1
now , in what is @entity6 's " home " game , the @entity6 risk being outnumbered by the fans of their bitter rival club			1
it is the latest in a string of turf war incidents that come under the banner of territorial discrimination , where regional disputes between sets of fans are played out in chants during top - flight matches			1
while the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) used to hand out hefty fines to deal with such incidents , clubs agreed prior to the start of the season to use the threat of stadium closures in order to tackle the problem head on			2
@entity52 ' stadium was partially closed for two @entity53 matches earlier this season after their fans sang derogatory chants during a victory over @entity23 , prompting an appeal from the club 's general manager @entity59 for their supporters to stop bellowing " self - harming " songs			1
@entity15 football is now locked in a duel fight , to try and combat incidents of racist chanting towards black players that have blighted the game both this season and last , and these long - running spats between different parts of @entity15 's cities as well as its regions			1
@entity15 frequently define themselves by their region and that regionalism is often played out in the nation 's football stadiums			1
and in an interview with @entity80 in october , @entity52 's president @entity78 said it was vitally important to make a distinction between racism an these regional turf wars			1
" @entity15 is the land of the 1,000 boroughs , " @entity78 exclusively told @entity0			1
" there is rivalry between two boroughs that are 50 meters away and they do n't talk to each other			0
" a lot of what goes under racism in terms of international news is actually territorial discrimination			2
is that acceptable ? no , but it is completely different to racism			0
" it is the same song that has been sung for 25 or 30 years and suddenly what happened in august , the board of the ( @entity15 ) federation changed the ( punishment ) from administrative fines to penalties that led to the closure of a part of the stadium or the stadium itself			1
" @entity78 argued it was " nonsense " that the new edicts had effectively handed too much power to hardcore groups of fans who are usually the protagonists when offensive songs are aired			0
" as it stands , it is unreasonable and it obviously gives too much control to the group of hardcore fans ; now they have a tool to decide what is going to happen			0
" again , there is that subtle but definitive distinction between racism and typical @entity15 territorial confrontation			1
" it is going to be difficult to ( change anything ) in the middle of the season because some punishments have already been done			0
" a group of @entity6 's fans have also called the closure of the @entity18 " nonsensical " while some say they plan on boycotting the match in response to the league 's decision			1
stadium closures have become a frequent occurrence over the past few seasons in @entity15 football , but mostly in response to incidents of a racist nature			1
the most high profile came in a friendly match between @entity7 and lower league team @entity155 in january 2013 , when @entity7 midfielder @entity156 left the field after being the subject of monkey noises from a section of the home support			2
specter of racism his protest made headlines around the globe and prompted soccer 's authorities to confront the ugly specter of racism in football			2
the game 's world governing body @entity175 subsequently set up a racism task force that suggested harsher punishments for players or clubs found guilty of discrimination			2
but still the abuse continued			0
in may 2013 , @entity156 -- who now plays for @entity182 in @entity183 -- and teammates @entity184 and @entity186 were the targets when @entity7 's clash with @entity189 was temporarily halted as visiting fans chanted racist abuse at the trio			1
@entity78 acknowledged there is a problem in @entity15 football regarding racism and welcomed the tougher stance from the game 's ruling bodies but warned it would still take some time before players from different cultures were fully embraced			1
" any form of racism should be fought , " he said			0
" in @entity15 there is a high degree of attitudes that are n't ready for embracing different cultures and religions			2
" i came to high school in @entity211 in the late 1980s , early 1990s , and there are things that were said then that were considered normal that would be considered unreasonable now			0
" the @entity214 has started much earlier than us in terms of embracing different cultures and regions			0
" the @entity214 has always had a much higher percentage of black people in the country so it was much more normal for you			0
" we are in the @entity214 of the 1970s ( in @entity15 ) so you have to place things into context			2
" if you judge it from a @entity214 point of view , what has happened is unacceptable , but you have to understand that you need to take some steps before certain aspects are digested and made familiar and embraced by a population , a culture and a country			0
" @entity78 says it is hypocritical for clubs to be complaining about the punishments when they voted them through prior to the start of the season			0
" up until last year the same chants were sung and it was an administrative fine , â ‚ ¬ 20,000 or â ‚ ¬ 30,000 and nobody cared , " he said			0
" suddenly , because of these penalties , it came to the news			0
" @entity15 is very peculiar on that front , so you should distinguish between territorial discrimination -- which we are not in favor of -- but it is very different from racism , they are not on the same level			1
" the same people who ( have been ) moaning about it are the same people that in august voted that they were fine with the fines that would be given			0
" so there has to be a step up in terms of attention into everything that happens in the governance of football because that was obvious and evident it was coming			0
