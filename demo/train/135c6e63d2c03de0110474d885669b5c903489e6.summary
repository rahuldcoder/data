@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 military and an allied rebel group massacred ethnic @entity6 in the @entity1 in the aftermath of genocide in @entity4 , says a leaked draft report commissioned by the @entity10			1
the report states that it is not making a definitive conclusion on whether the slayings in @entity1 amounted to genocide , and that a competent judiciary would have to try the cases			0
commissioned by the office of the @entity18 , the report says " tens of thousands " of @entity6 civilians were slaughtered with knives , bludgeoned with hammers and burned alive as the @entity4 army and the @entity23 swept across @entity1 -- then called @entity1 -- leading to the toppling of dictator @entity27			1
the report , titled " @entity29 , " documents crimes against humanity throughout the @entity1 between 1993 and 2003			0
the @entity4 government blasted the report as " malicious , offensive and ridiculous			1
" " it is immoral and unacceptable that the @entity10 , an organization that failed outright to prevent genocide in @entity4 and the subsequent refugees crisis [ and ] is the direct cause for so much suffering in @entity1 and @entity4 , now accuses the army that stopped the genocide ... in the @entity1 , " government spokesman @entity35 said in a statement			1
the final version of the report will be officially published monday			0
its most controversial parts are accusations against the @entity4 government of " systematic attacks , in particular , killings and massacres perpetrated against members of the @entity6 ethnic group			1
" " there is no denying that ethnic massacres were committed and that the victims were mostly @entity6 from @entity57 , @entity4 and @entity1 , " the report states			1
" the joint mission 's preliminary opinion is that some of these alleged massacres could constitute acts of genocide			0
" it adds , " the majority of the victims were children , women , elderly people and the sick , who posed no threat to the attacking forces			1
" the @entity4 government said the report 's " extremely serious allegations " are " based on questionable methodology , sourcing and shockingly low standard of proof			1
" " given the gravity of its mission , the @entity82 's failure to consult with @entity4 even though they found time to meet with over 200 [ non-governmental ] representatives is shocking and shows complete disregard for fundamental fairness , " @entity35 said			2
more than 1 million @entity4 fled to neighboring eastern @entity1 when the @entity4 genocide ended in 1994 -- most of them @entity6			1
in 1996 , @entity4 invaded @entity1 in pursuit of the genocide orchestrators , who were living amid hundreds of thousands of other refugees			2
the stated goal of @entity4 during that time was to end the refugee crisis in eastern @entity1			0
but the @entity10 report says that the @entity4 military did not discriminate between fugitives and refugees , nor did it discriminate by age or gender			1
" the majority of the incidents reported indicate that the @entity6 were targeted as such , with no discrimination between them , " the report says			1
" the numerous attacks against the @entity6 in @entity1 , who were not part of the refugees , seem to confirm that it was all @entity6 , as such			0
" the report says people who convinced soldiers that they were @entity110 were let go , while the @entity6 were massacred			1
" people who were able to persuade the aggressors that they belonged to another ethnic group were released just before the massacres , " the report says			0
the report says tens of thousands of @entity6 were massacred in particular areas with an intent to commit genocide			1
" even if only a part of the @entity6 population in @entity1 was targeted and destroyed , it could nonetheless constitute a crime of genocide , if this was the intention of the perpetrators , " the report says			2
although independent researchers have documented the crimes against humanity committed by the @entity4 government , the @entity10 report is the most official and forthcoming accusation made so far			2
@entity4 indicated that it could withdraw from @entity10 peacekeeping operations if the report is published			2
the country is a major contributor to the peacekeeping force in @entity137 , and has sent troops to @entity139			0
the report is publicly humiliating for recently re-elected president @entity141 , who earned praise for helping heal @entity4 after the genocide			2
in recent years , the nation has developed dramatically , with a reputation as one of the safest , cleanest , least - corrupt and most organized countries in @entity148			0
the fallout of the scathing report is unclear , but it is sure to have an impact			0
@entity4 's reconciliation policy is governed by anti-genocide laws that human rights organizations have called intentionally vague			0
the laws make it virtually impossible to accuse the @entity4 government of human rights violations , crimes against humanity or war crimes			0
accusing @entity4 of crimes against humanity committed in the @entity1 would break those laws			0
in april , presidential aspirant @entity164 was arrested in @entity165 for saying that @entity6 were killed by the @entity4 government , both in @entity4 and in neighboring @entity1			1
@entity164 was charged with ' genocide ideology ' for those comments , and could face up to 25 years in prison			0
her @entity170 lawyer was arrested on similar charges , but was later released			0
col. @entity172 , who was a senior member of the @entity4 army and a key actor in the wars in the @entity1 before fleeing to @entity148 in 2008 , said @entity4 never set out to commit genocide against the @entity6 , but war crimes were committed			1
" civilians died , politicians died , " @entity172 said earlier this month before @entity4 's presidential election			2
" they died in the @entity1 , they died in other places			0
