@entity0 -- an eagle ray weighing as much as 300 pounds landed on top of a woman on a boat in the @entity7 last week , throwing her to the deck and pinning her underneath it -- the " scariest thing " that 's ever happened to her , she said			1
the woman , @entity12 , was on the chartered boat friday with her husband and three children , taking pictures of a group of eagle rays as they flew out of the water			1
" these eagle rays , they were flying through the air , " said @entity20 of @entity21 , the captain of the boat			2
" these giant things go out of the water and slam back down			2
" @entity12 said she was in the front of the boat , snapping away			2
" the first picture i took of the ray jumping was 50 feet in front of us , " she said			2
when the ray jumped again , @entity12 said she was readying her camera			1
" next thing i know , it hit me square in the chest			0
i fell backwards and fell down , " she said			0
@entity20 said the ray kept " slamming and slamming on top of ( @entity12 ) , trying to swim away			1
" @entity12 said the incident happened so fast that she did n't have time to react			1
" i was just trying to push it off me as i was scooting backwards , " she said			0
@entity12 's husband and children watched in horror			1
@entity49 @entity48 and @entity50 were patrolling the water near the tour boat when they heard screams			0
" we turned around and looked and saw the eagle ray thrashing around in the boat and at that point we realized we had a problem , " said @entity54			0
as the officers made their way to the boat , @entity54 said , " shoes were getting thrown off the boat , towels were going everywhere			0
" by the time officers made it to the boat @entity12 had freed herself from under the ray			1
@entity20 said the animal measured 8 - feet across , and probably weighed a good 300 pounds			0
" it 's just massive , it has a 10 - foot tail , " she added			0
@entity20 said everyone thought that @entity12 was dead , but when she was freed she did n't have a scratch on her			2
@entity12 said it was the scariest thing that 's ever happened to her , and she 's thankful she did n't get hurt			1

@entity84 rays can measure as much as 10 feet across and 17 feet long -- from their snout to the end of their barbed tails -- and weigh up to 500 pounds , according to the @entity89			1
the spines on the tails are venomous and can inflict serious wounds			0
in 2008 , a woman died from the impact when a ray jumped out of the water and hit her as she boated in the @entity7 , but @entity54 said both incidents were freak accidents			1
