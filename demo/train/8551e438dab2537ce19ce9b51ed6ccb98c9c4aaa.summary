@entity1 , @entity0 -- events in @entity1 's art world last weekend sent out contrasting signals as to the future of the global art market			1
will the bubble burst ? " @entity12 " by artist @entity9 , fit the current mood of uncertainty			2
mid-season contemporary art auctions at @entity1 's @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 confirmed fears that the art market might be the next victim of the financial crisis			1
while sales figures were still significant , they brought in considerably less than the presale estimates that had been put together when the future of global finance looked less bleak			1
the auctions showed that a readjustment of prices might be necessary in an art world that just a month ago saw artist @entity30 making Â£ 111 million for 218 of his works			0
@entity32 , who has written a book " @entity34 in the @entity35 , " explained that those art buyers who have now dropped out of the market are the speculators			0
" those who continue to buy art are the real art lovers ; they are not willing to relinquish that passion , " @entity40 told @entity2			0
" i have just heard of someone who fired their chauffeur to continue funding an expensive art - buying habit , " she added			0
some artists are also going to extreme lengths to continue their trade			2
at the annual @entity56 art fair in @entity1 's @entity57 , @entity54 gallery @entity52 , literally blended their art with the credit crunch			1
the artists and gallery owner @entity61 ate remnants of visitors ' food and slept only when a visitor was kind enough to offer them a roof			1
but the fair showed that the larger public 's interest in contemporary art remains robust			1
@entity56 brought in thousands of visitors from around the globe and most gallery owners seemed content with sales			1
@entity75 from the @entity77 gallery , based in @entity78 and @entity1 , told @entity2 : " we were a little anxious , but this fair turned out to be the best we 've had			1
" @entity81 and @entity82 sold almost all its works in the booth including a @entity87 piece for $ 2.7 million			0
are you still buying art ? whilst @entity87 's art represents the higher end of prices at @entity56 ; most works at the fair are cheaper than at auction houses , therefore reflecting a wider art - buying audience			1
@entity97 , director of dicksmith gallery , a hip and relatively new gallery representing young artists fresh from their masters degrees , said that while there was less of a rush to buy the gallery 's works -- priced at around $ 6000 to $ 40,000 -- this year , he remained confident about investment in art. " i believe art is still an absolute necessity , " @entity97 said , adding ; " this economic crisis might kill the mad hype in the art world , but there is still interest in new ideas and new works			1
" @entity117 , who works for @entity120 and @entity121 gallery @entity118 , agreed that while people might be slower to rush into buying unknown art , the outcome for the art world is not necessarily a bad one			0
" i notice there is more of a conversation going on now before a collector decides to buy something " @entity117 said			0
" this climate might allow artists to focus more on what they are making			2
if it 's not anymore about quantity , the focus will come back to the art object			2
" some artists might beg to disagree			0
angry with his financial situation , one of the artists at @entity143 , @entity144 , caused a frenzy when he ran around the fair naked			2
" we have to learn how to survive these difficult times " says @entity61			0
her words ring especially true as @entity52 did not sell any of its works -- it seems the art public might not be ready to hear the words " survival " just yet .			0

sales at @entity1 's top auction houses failed to *achieve* the low presale estimates
some artists at @entity56 ate remnants of foods to *showcase* the current crisis .
most galleries at the fair produced *satisfying* sales results , they *reported*
