-- @entity2 art dealer @entity1 helped persuade wealthy buyers to shell out millions of dollars for works he claimed famous masters of modern art had painted			1
but in reality , @entity11 authorities allege , the works he sold as @entity8 and @entity9 were fakes painted by an artist he met on a @entity17 street corner			1
the alleged scheme stretched for nearly two decades , involved several @entity20 art galleries and earned the conspirators more than $ 30 million , according to an indictment unsealed in federal court on monday			1
last week , authorities closed in on @entity26 and his brother , arresting them in @entity2 , federal prosecutors said			1
the brothers , according to the indictment , face conspiracy and money laundering charges			0
the painter , @entity32 , was also indicted			2
he 's accused of making false statements to @entity35 agents , conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud			0
investigators believe he fled to @entity40 as the alleged scheme started to unravel			0
the indictment is the latest chapter in a case that 's rattled the modern art world , involving several galleries and wealthy buyers			2
galleries made more than $ 80 million off of dozens of fake works , the indictment alleges			1
and @entity50 and his associates made more than $ 33 million			1
" today 's charges paint a picture of perpetual lies and greed			0
as alleged , the defendants tricked victims into paying more than $ 33 million for worthless paintings which they fabricated in the names of world - famous artists , " @entity11 attorney @entity57 said in a statement monday			2
" the @entity1 brothers then laundered and hid their illegal proceeds overseas			0
with today 's indictment , the defendants must now answer for their alleged roles as modern masters of forgery and deceit			0
" what started with a meeting between @entity26 and @entity32 on a @entity20 street corner evolved into an elaborate plot , the indictment alleges			1
@entity32 would paint works in his home in @entity80 , @entity20			2
then @entity26 and his associates would peddle them through galleries to unsuspecting buyers who paid millions , the indictment says			1
the alleged forged works purported to be paintings by famous artists , including @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , the indictment says			2
but long before the works of art were sold , according to the indictment , @entity26 played a role in the forgeries			1
to make the paintings more convincing , @entity26 bought old canvases at flea markets , stained newer canvases with tea bags to make them look older and gave @entity32 old paint to use			0
then , after the works were completed , according to the indictment , @entity26 " subjected many fake works to various processes , such as heating them , cooling them , and exposing them to the elements outdoors , in an attempt to make the fake works seem older than they actually were			1
" in at least one instance , the indictment says , @entity50 used a blow dryer to heat up a forged painting			0
authorities have said his girlfriend , @entity121 , was a key player in the alleged conspiracy			0
after pleading guilty last year to charges of conspiracy , wire fraud , money laundering and filing false federal income tax returns , she 's awaiting sentencing in federal court			0
in an interview with @entity131 in @entity132 last year , @entity32 admitted imitating modern masters ' works , but said he never intended to pass them off for profit			0
in court documents , prosecutors allege he received between several hundred and several thousand dollars for paintings the art dealers and galleries sold for millions			1
" i made a knife to cut fruit , " he said , according to @entity131			0
" but if others use it to kill , blaming me is unfair			0
" if the lawsuits filed against @entity26 and his associates are any indication , there 's already plenty of finger - pointing over the alleged forgeries			1
a number of civil cases against him are still pending , according to federal court records			0
it was not immediately clear whether @entity26 had legal representation or whether @entity2 authorities plan to extradite him to the @entity11			1
