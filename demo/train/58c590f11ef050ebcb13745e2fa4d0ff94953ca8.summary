-- the dark curtain rises again on the tragedy of @entity3 and @entity4 , and the next act begins much like its forerunners			1
the dead ride in caskets through streets , and mothers wail their grief to the heavens			2
as @entity3 reserves gather like a storm over @entity4 's horizon , the added bloodshed of an incursion appears imminent , and millions watching around the world ask : what could they hope to achieve ? there is no dramatic endgame in this , but there are concrete objectives , says @entity3 military analyst and columnist @entity31			1
there are official ones and unofficial ones , short - term and long - term , that make sense for @entity3 , he argues			1
many of them will work , concedes critical @entity3 columnist @entity39			1
but he disagrees about their wisdom			2
they wo n't cure the disease but instead feed it , he argues			2
military objective no. 1 first , the conservative government led by prime minister @entity45 wants to stop the rocket fire by force			1
and weaken the @entity49 militants and other groups behind it , @entity31 says			2
" @entity52 the political clout and the ability of @entity49 to act both as a political and military - terrorist movement			1
" those are the official goals given by the @entity58 for the military operation named @entity60 , he says			2
and they 'll probably be achieved , @entity31 says			2
" for the short - run , no doubt , " @entity39 concurs			2
but he also thinks @entity49 will come back stronger militarily and politically			2
that 's what happened over two years ago in operation @entity65 and over five years ago in @entity66 , he says			2
in the latter , 1,300 @entity67 and more than a dozen @entity3 died			1
@entity7 ' roots @entity39 sees the rocket fire from @entity4 as the boiling over of cumulative tensions			1
he points to the peace process initiated by @entity74 secretary of state @entity73 between @entity3 and @entity67			1
the one that broke down weeks ago			0
the whole time , a piece was missing from the negotiating table , he says			0
" @entity4 was ignored totally			1
" then a litany of youth killings ignited passions on both sides			0
three @entity83 teens were murdered , and @entity3 forces swept the @entity85 for suspects , making arrests that had nothing to do with the case , @entity39 says			1
the murder of a @entity67 teen quickly followed ; his body was torched			0
suspicions arose that it was revenge for the @entity3 ' deaths			1
add to that the desperation in @entity4			1
the narrow strip of land is locked in on all sides , and people there live in dire poverty and deprivation			0
" @entity4 is today the biggest cage in the world , " @entity39 says			1
the rocket fire is just a part of it all , he says			0
it 's a way of @entity49 pounding the table , pointing out @entity4 's misery			1
@entity39 's solution to the rocket fire : pay more attention to @entity117			0
open borders , so they can move freely			0
@entity31 , on the other hand , believes that the peaceful approach -- that calm will be met with calm -- has n't worked out			0
" this formula is out of the game			0
it 's not in the cards now , " he says			0
the military option has become inevitable			2
how @entity130 blocks rockets from @entity4 , protects @entity3 @entity133 drill - down @entity49 militants have come back stronger after the last military operation in at least one sense , @entity31 says			1
they have more long - range rockets			0
previously , militants had to import them all from the outside			0
now they can also construct them themselves			0
they 've also buried a network of launch sites below the ground 's surface			2
hitting them " is quite a job , " @entity31 says			0
the @entity150 will have to strike deep into those systems			1
but the @entity150 has also adapted			1
its bombs have become more accurate			0
that also reduces collateral damage in @entity4 , he says			1
most who die were shooting rockets , he says			0
" those who deserve it			0
" it 's all a vicious cycle he 's seen before , @entity39 says			0
the @entity150 destroys the militants ' capabilities ; they come back stronger			1
" by the next operation , they will be even better equipped , " he says			0
ground incursion @entity3 has called up 30,000 reserve troops and has talked about pulling in 10,000 more , a signal that there may be a ground incursion into @entity4			1
@entity39 firmly believes it will happen , that the @entity150 otherwise will not be able to root out militants ' rocket systems			1
" i think it is in the cards			0
they 've not made the decision yet , " he says of the government			0
@entity45 may use aggressive rhetoric but is cautious about military decisions , he says			2
and so far , the government is satisfied with the operations as they have been -- only from the air thus far			2
the endgame the government hopes that @entity60 will give @entity3 a few years of relative peace , restore normalcy for a time , @entity31 says			1
" after every round of hostility ... there is a sort of lull that @entity3 enjoys very much , " he says			1
people can think about other things and tackle other issues , like the economy			0
but it 's not nearly worth the cost , @entity39 says			0
@entity199 of @entity67 will be killed , others ' lives ruined			0
but even from a purely selfish standpoint , it 's at best an empty victory			0
" we will see horrible scenes , " he says			0
" the world will condemn @entity3			1
and what comes out of it ? one year of peace			0
" @entity31 believes there is a permanent gain to be made , that repeated operations in @entity4 will wear the enemy down			1
he hopes that the lulls between battles will get longer and longer , " until our neighbor realizes that they can not make us disappear			2
they can not erase us from the map			0
" @entity39 thinks @entity4 militants wo n't quit until the misery there ends			1
he predicts that military intervention will set the stage for the next bloodcurdling act -- and then the next			2
new wave of @entity3 airstrikes hammers @entity4 flare - up in @entity3 - @entity67 violence : why now ? has the @entity233 crisis reached a tipping point ?			1

military operations in @entity4 make sense for @entity3 , an analyst says
they will only make the violence *fester* and come back strong , says another
with talk of the @entity150 calling up *40,000* reservists , a ground incursion looms
