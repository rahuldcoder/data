-- i recently ran my first half - marathon , and among the cheering fans along the race course , i saw several holding signs that read , " in our minds , you 're all @entity9			1
" i took it as a major compliment			0
granted , in my wave of the race , there were mostly average runners , just trying to make the finish line , but the signs gave us a much - needed lift			2
believe me , most endurance runners would love to be mentioned in the same sentence as any of @entity9 's elite athletes			1
that 's the appeal behind " running with the @entity9 , " from author and runner @entity22			1
the book is out in paperback , and for my mileage , it 's one of the best running reads in recent years			1
fans who follow long - distance running are already familiar with @entity9 's legendary success in the sport			1
take a look at just about any major endurance race of the past 30 years , everything from the @entity35 to the @entity36 to the @entity37 , and you 'll see runners from @entity9 , men and women , standing on the winner 's podium			1
so what 's behind their winning ways ? @entity22 , an experienced long - distance runner in his own right , is not the first person to ask this question			1
however , he was the first author to spend months in @entity9 looking for the answer			2
@entity22 , his wife and their three small children left @entity55 on an incredible journey to spend six months in the small town of @entity58 , high in @entity9 's @entity59			1
it 's ground zero for the country 's elite runners			1
while there , @entity22 spent time at @entity9 's elite training camps , running with everyone from @entity67 champions to barefoot children			1
@entity9 is filled with young hopefuls for whom running is not just a sport but a religion -- and for a lucky few , a path out of poverty			1
a champion runner can win thousands of dollars on the international race circuit			0
it 's a pittance in comparison to the professional athletes who play sports such as football and basketball , but in @entity9 , elite runners are celebrities who often live like royalty			1
it 's a country of contrasts , producing many of the world 's greatest runners while still beset by problems common to the @entity91			1
@entity22 portrays @entity9 in a realistic but positive light			1
readers will see he enjoyed this life - changing experience and the people there immensely			0
and you 've got to marvel at a country where one of the world 's most prestigious marathons is delayed by lions on the race course			1
when he 's not on the trail or the track , @entity22 is a journalist at @entity108			1
he recently talked to me about his book and his love of long - distance running			2
the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : did you learn the secret to what makes @entity9 such great runners ? @entity22 : tempting as it was to boil the secret of the @entity9 down to one or two factors , in the end i had to be honest			1
the @entity9 are on another level when it comes to running			1
they genuinely are the greatest runners on earth			2
the only people with even a crumb of an argument against this are their @entity131 neighbors , the @entity127			0
between them they can run the legs off the rest of the world at every distance from 800 meters up			2
yet , try as i might to find it , there was no single , all - conquering reason for their greatness			0
nothing you could bottle , package up and say : do this and you 'll run like a @entity9			2
instead , up in the @entity59 , a perfect combination of factors have all aligned to produce great runners			2
it 's not only the altitude , nor the active childhoods ( running miles to school barefoot each morning ) , nor the abundance of role models , nor the will to succeed , nor the lack of alternatives , nor the hard - work ethic , nor the culture of running that has grown up , nor the diet , nor all the other things i could mention			2
instead , it is all of these things combined			0
@entity0 : what is your favorite memory of your time in @entity9 ? @entity22 : my favorite memories are of running in the midst of a group of @entity9			1
attempting such a thing was always a hair - raising experience , clinging on for my life as we wound our way faster and faster through the unknown countryside			0
but in those rare moments when i felt i could keep up , it was very special to be there , among them , our feet pounding the dusty road in unison , the sun rising in front of us , children standing sleepy - eyed at the doorways of their mud huts , rubbing their eyes , wondering if they 'd just imagined that white man flashing by in the middle of the group			0
@entity0 : have you kept in contact with the runners you met in @entity9 ? @entity22 : yes			1
some of them may not even have electricity or running water , but they all have @entity204			0
in fact i 've organized for my former neighbor , @entity207 , to come over to the @entity208 in may to run the @entity209			0
i 'll be there cheering him on and handing him his water bottle			0
@entity0 : will the rest of the world ever catch up to @entity9 in endurance running ? @entity22 : they could			1
great as the @entity9 are , their training is not very sophisticated			1
while this is in some ways their strength , people like @entity221 coach @entity220 are showing that if you use science and technology in the right way , and with the right people , you can get results			0
his two athletes , @entity232 ( from the @entity208 ) and @entity233 ( from the @entity221 ) , coming first and second in the 10,000 - meter in the @entity234 , is testimony to that			0
@entity0 : what do you tell people when they ask you why you run ? @entity22 : i usually shrug and say i do n't know -- because unless you also run , it 's hard for me to explain why i do it			1
it 's like trying to describe the taste of a strawberry to someone who has never eaten one			0
it 's much better to give them a strawberry to taste			0
but if pushed , i 'll say it makes me feel happy , strong and alive			0
not too many things can achieve that so easily			0
read an excerpt from " running with the @entity9 " here are more recommended running reads : " @entity258 " by @entity259 to many fans , this is the bible of barefoot running			1
@entity259 's quest to heal a sore foot leads him on one of the most interesting paths ever taken by a running writer			2
his book is packed with informative detail about the science of running			2
it 's also a compelling story of a 50 - mile endurance race , held in one of the most remote spots on earth , @entity276 's @entity275			0
i was especially intrigued by his portrayal of the @entity281 people , who are some of the world 's greatest distance runners and especially " @entity284 , " the mysterious loner who becomes @entity259 's guide on this fascinating journey			2
" @entity292 " by @entity290 for anyone who has tried to lose weight or for athletes looking for a little inspiration , you 'd be hard - pressed to do better than @entity290 's story of self - redemption			0
roll tells how he went from promising college swimmer to alcoholic to overweight middle - aged father and eventually to becoming one of the fittest men on the planet			0
roll transformed himself through self - discipline , rigorous training and a plant - based diet			0
there 's plenty of fuel here for anyone interested in learning more about becoming vegan			0
what readers will really enjoy is following @entity290 in his quest to complete in @entity320 's @entity319 race , 320 miles of swimming , biking and running			2
it 's a brutal event that would make even the toughest @entity323 triathlete cry uncle			0
" @entity324 " by @entity325 who knew the @entity328 author had run more marathons than he 's written novels ? for those counting , @entity325 has reportedly run 25 marathons , including a 62 - mile ultra-marathon and penned 13 novels to date			0
like his surreal masterpiece , " @entity335 , " @entity325 's memoir on running is beautifully written , imaginative and ethereal			2
he also writes in absorbing detail about the pain , injuries and obsession that anyone who 's ever run a @entity342 will recognize and sympathize with wholeheartedly .			0
