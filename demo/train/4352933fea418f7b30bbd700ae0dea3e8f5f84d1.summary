to be a politician today is to live in some ways like a citizen of @entity3			2
a politician must assume that he or she is under 24 - hour audio - visual surveillance			2
any objectionable remark , any untoward joke , any awkward facial expression may be recorded and broadcast			2
professional and personal ruin can strike at any moment			1
if @entity16 's " macaca " moment did n't drive home the point , @entity14 's 47 % video certainly should			1
but it 's not only politicians who live under perpetual surveillance			1
we all do ! earlier this month , researchers at @entity25 detailed how @entity26 systematically erodes users ' privacy wishes			2
" researchers found that during the first four years , users steadily limited what personal data was visible to strangers within their school network			2
yet through changes @entity26 introduced to its platform in 2009 and 2010 , the social network actually succeeded in reversing some users ' inclination to avoid public disclosure of their data			2
in fact , the social network 's new policies were not only able to partly override an active desire not to post personal details publicly , but they have so far kept such disclosures from sinking back to their lower levels , according to the study			1
they also found that even as people sought to limit what strangers could learn about them from their @entity26 profiles , they actually increased what information they shared with their friends			2
@entity26 's ceo @entity57 has famously said that privacy is no longer a social norm			1
he 's worked mightily to make those words self - fulfilling , and in tandem with other technologies ( smartphones ) and social media ( notably @entity65 ) , @entity57 has succeeded			1
the demise of privacy as a social norm is leading to the demise of privacy as a legal right			0
@entity14 likely wo n't face legal sanctions for videotaping @entity71			1
@entity72 , spokesman for the @entity74 state attorney , explains why not : " for the law to be broken , the person being taped must have a reasonable expectation of privacy			0
" @entity79 , a speaker might have expected that an off - the - record , closed - door speech in a private home would be " private			1
the less privacy we have , the less we have a legal right to -- and the less we have a legal right to , the less we will have			0
for those accustomed to older ways , this new world of compulsive and compulsory self - revelation is a strange place in which to live			0
yet it could be said that we are in fact reverting to the oldest way of all			0
through most of human existence , human beings had little to no privacy			1
for most of the past 10,000 years , most people lived in tiny farming villages , where everybody knew everything about them and about all their family			0
@entity103 was born in the city , as @entity105 famously observed when urban life was still a new experience for most @entity108			1
" on any person who desires such queer prizes , @entity109 will bestow the gift of loneliness and the gift of privacy			0
" it 's a paradox , but also a fact : the only way to experience privacy is in the midst of a crowd			1
the theme song to the 1980s situation comedy " @entity122 " celebrated an urban bar as a place where " everybody knows your name			0
" through most of human history , most people would take it for granted that the people they met would know their name -- name singular , since for most of human history , most people only needed a single name to identify themselves			1
when @entity105 celebrated urban anonymity in his 1949 essay , " here is @entity109 , " urbanism was still a relatively new experience for most @entity108			0
the @entity108 had become majority urban as recently as 1920 , and then only by the @entity108 @entity143 definition of urban as a settlement of more than 2,500 persons			0
will we in retrospect come to see the urban anonymity celebrated by @entity105 as a brief interval in human history ? already in 1962 , the prophetic scholar of media @entity153 foresaw the coming of a " global village " : a planet in which information spread as fast as in the farming village of yore			1
a @entity163 search of the phrase reveals that most users of the phrase imagine the global village as a friendly , tranquil place			0
the old village was a place in which conflict could never be escaped , in which the public and the private could never be separated			1
so it has become in the new			0
what happened to @entity71 can happen to anyone who has ever said or done anything improper or stupid in the vicinity of any electronic device			1
it can happen to anyone who has ever sent an e-mail that might cause offense to a third party			0
it can happen to anyone who has ever posted a later - regretted photo or video online			1
granted , most of us are protected somewhat by others ' lack of interest in our secrets			0
but that can change in an instant if our oafish behavior is oafish enough			0
a few seconds of oafish video can generate a lifetime of humiliation -- that will torture the humiliated person long after it has ceased to amuse the people who once laughed at him			2
it can happen to you .			0

@entity211 : @entity71 's 47 % video showed that there 's no such thing as private *sphere*
for politicians and for the rest of us , every moment can be *captured* forever , he says
@entity223 : @entity103 was a relatively recent human *invention* , and now it 's likely gone forever
