@entity0 , @entity1 -- the federal government has set aside nearly $ 2 billion in stimulus funds to clean up @entity1 's decommissioned @entity0 nuclear site , once the center of the country 's @entity8 plutonium production			1
that is more stimulus funding than some entire states have received , which has triggered a debate as to whether the money is being properly spent			2
the facility sprawls across approximately 600 square miles of south - central @entity1 , an area roughly half the size of @entity17			2
it was built in the 1940s as part of the " @entity21 " to develop the first atomic weapon during @entity23 millions of dollars and thousands of jobs poured into the remote area about 75 miles east of @entity26 where nine nuclear reactors were eventually built			2
during the @entity8 , @entity0 became a main source of plutonium production for the nation 's nuclear weapons program			1
decades of improper radioactive waste disposal earned @entity0 the notorious distinction of being one of the most contaminated nuclear sites in the @entity36			1
today , the @entity0 site is a virtual ghost town , and those involved in the cleanup say they will need every dollar of the federal stimulus funds			1
there are still millions of gallons of untreated contaminated groundwater , hundreds of buildings used for plutonium enrichment that need to be torn down and underground tanks that are full of radioactive sludge			0
the stimulus money will reduce the cleanup time by years , according to @entity53 , who oversees the federal project at @entity0			1
" it was perfect work , ready to go for the stimulus package , " @entity53 said			0
" each day that passes the conditions worsen [ and ] the receipt of the federal stimulus money allows us to reduce the costs and also allows us to reduce the cleanup footprint much sooner , years sooner			2
" the money has also created jobs for about 1,400 people at @entity0 , including @entity68 who manages a team that is tearing down equipment that is heavily contaminated by radiation			1
despite the dangers of his job , @entity72 said it came just at the right time			0
" i had managed a production warehouse facility for one of the largest companies in the world , [ i ] thought i 'd be there for 20 years , " @entity72 said			0
" we laid off 8,000 people in three months and they closed down our plant , [ and ] those jobs are n't jobs you just read the paper and get			2
" @entity0 wo n't be decontaminated quickly			2
the workers have to suit up three to four times a day in protective gear			0
they break down contaminated equipment through a " glove box , " allowing them to disassemble the equipment a room away through lead - lined gloves			0
each time a worker removes the gloves , a colleague must check for radiation exposure			0
the large scale of the project and years of cost overruns have led critics to complain that stimulus money is being misdirected at @entity0			1
a report by sens. @entity110 , @entity111 , and @entity112 , @entity113 , listed @entity0 as one of 100 sites where stimulus money may have been wasted			1
the @entity0 cleanup " has been plagued by massive cost and schedule problems - and almost no progress , " according to the report			1
@entity122 , who runs a @entity0 watchdog organization , says he supports using stimulus money to rid the nuclear site of its radioactive waste			1
but he questions whether the funds are going where they are most needed			0
" you are not seeing the value that we should be seeing for the cleanup and the environment , " said @entity122 , who heads @entity130			0
" they are picking the low - hanging fruit , the easy projects that give very nice photo opportunities			0
but that does n't cost $ 2 billion			1
" @entity0 is getting more money than many states in stimulus funds , and you would expect to see real progress for cleanup [ to ] happen with those dollars			1
" while debate continues over whether and how stimulus dollars should be used , the @entity149 area that surrounds the @entity0 -- which includes @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 -- is reaping the benefits of the cleanup boom			1
@entity157 began receiving stimulus dollars in march 2009 , which helped the surrounding cities and towns avoid the catastrophe that has plagued other communities impacted by the recent economic downturn			2
the @entity149 area has one of the lowest unemployment rates in @entity1 , and the housing market has barely been affected by the recent economic downturn , according to the @entity168			0
@entity169 , who owns a local office furniture store , said his business was " at a standstill " last year before the orders from @entity0 contractors started pouring in			0
@entity169 had to hire six temporary workers , two of which he may keep on full time , to deal with the boom in business			0
" we are on track to have the best year ever , " @entity169 said			0
his business has been in his family for three generations and will likely stay profitable since the @entity0 cleanup project is expected to take another 40 years			1
" it has my manufacturers raising their eyebrows saying , ' wow how does that guy do that ? ' "			0
