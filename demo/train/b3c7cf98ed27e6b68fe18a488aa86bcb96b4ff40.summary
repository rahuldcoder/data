@entity0 -- for several days , through sweltering heat and sudden rainstorms , the protesters have gathered in awe - inspiring numbers in this bustling city			1
they have turned multi-lane highways into sprawling camps of umbrellas , tents and political banners			1
their demand : an open field of candidates in the next election for @entity0 's top political position , not politicians pre-approved by the central @entity19 government			1
except for dramatic scenes on sunday , when the police 's use of tear gas on protesters shocked many @entity26 , the demonstrations have been impressively calm			1
but tensions are on the rise			2
some protesters have issued an ultimatum to @entity0 's chief executive @entity31 , whom many view as a puppet of @entity19 : you have until the end of the day thursday to resign or we occupy government buildings			1
the police , in turn , have warned protesters -- many of whom are students -- that such actions would face " decisive enforcement			1
" what happens next is anybody 's guess			2
for now , the demonstrations still radiate a largely festive atmosphere			2
but underneath runs a gamut of feelings -- optimism and fear , confusion and exhaustion , determination and frustration			2
opinion : @entity19 's @entity0 dilemma hope : @entity61 , an 18 - year - old high school student , says she remains hopeful about the outlook for the protest movement			1
" people are very peaceful			2
this revolution really can help @entity0 , " she says , sitting on a concrete barrier in the middle of a highway occupied by protesters			1
she says she 's been part of the student actions since friday and has slept in the protest areas three of the nights			1
" the road is very dirty , and it feels hot , " she says , but adds that with lots of other students around , the atmosphere is upbeat			2
" people did n't fight , did n't argue and they also help each other , " @entity79 says			0
" the feeling is good out here			0
" the key , she says , is for @entity0 leader @entity31 to " come out and talk to us			1
" confusion : @entity87 , 19 , says he 's been part of the demonstrations since a class boycott began last week			0
a student in business administration , he 's spent nearly every night at the protests			1
but now he 's feeling " a little bit confused " about what will happen next and what the consequences of the protests will be			1
" i think for most protesters , they also feel a little bit confused right now , " he said , sitting outside one of the entrances to the government headquarters			1
he says the movement started well , gaining a lot of support from @entity26			1
but the lack of an overall leader means " there is no clear and obvious direction for us to take			0
" @entity87 says he is personally in favor of occupying government buildings but is doubtful it will go down well with the wider population			0
" @entity115 are against this kind of action , " he says			0
" they support a peaceful protest			0
" @entity87 fears that if the demonstrations simply remain as sit - ins on highways , " more and more people will go home			1
" fear : @entity126 , 19 , was at the protests on sunday , the day when police fired tear gas at demonstrators			1
but she then fell ill with a fever and returned for the first time on thursday			0
the social sciences student says she finds the calmness at the main protest site unsettling			2
" i 'm afraid something more serious will happen later because it 's too peaceful , " @entity136 says , talking of possible action against demonstrators by authorities			1
" people should be more alert , " she says , sitting in the shadow of an overpass			0
" it feels like a festival or a party			0
" @entity136 says she wo n't stay at the site overnight , because she has to go home to take medication			0
but she plans to return friday , even though it 's not a public holiday			0
in the current circumstances , she says , " missing class is not really a big problem			0
" determination : @entity158 , 21 , a student who 's participated in the protests for the past five days , expresses concern about the thinner crowds at the main protest site on thursday afternoon			1
" it 's so quiet , " he says , " there are so few people " compared with the two previous days			2
he says he 's worried that the smaller crowd could make it easier for the police to move in			0
but @entity158 is willing to stick it out amid the heat and the humidity			0
" we need to stay a long time , " he says			0
" we need to fight for our freedom			0
" how long the protest go on is in the hands of the @entity0 government , he suggests			1
but the government 's position will probably " not change so fast , " he admits			0
frustration : @entity179 , a 20 - year - old student , says he 's " disappointed and frustrated " because " the government is still not listening to us			2
" @entity179 has spent five days at the protests , sleeping overnight once			2
he says the tear gas fired by police on sunday night made his eyes water			0
but he 's not convinced that the demonstrations will last a great deal longer , because of the impact they 're having on business in the city			0
" the umbrella revolution can not sustain very long because of economic concerns of other @entity0 people , " he says , using a popular term for the protests			1
@entity179 says he thinks a threat by some students to occupy government buildings was risky , as it could give police a " chance to use violence			0

" this revolution really can help @entity0 , " says a high school student
" i 'm afraid something more serious will happen later , " says another protester
some demonstrators are confused about where the movement is headed
the protesters have taken over key highways in @entity0 for several days
