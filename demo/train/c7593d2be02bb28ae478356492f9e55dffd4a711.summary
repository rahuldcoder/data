@entity0 -- the @entity2 for a third time has turned aside an urgent appeal from @entity5 states to close @entity7 - area shipping channels so invasive @entity9 carp wo n't have a doorway into the world 's largest freshwater ecosystem			1
the justices monday turned aside without comment another request for intervention , the latest chapter in a nearly century - old dispute involving six @entity20 states and the @entity22 province of @entity23			1
at issue is a direct challenge to @entity27 ' complex water diversion and sewage disposal network , which some predict will inadvertently allow the non-native fish to enter @entity31			1
some environmentalists and lawmakers fear an economic and ecological disaster if the creatures breach man - made barriers			0
and there are concerns the fish may have already slipped past locks and entered the massive bodies of fresh water			2
the fish can grow up to 4 feet in length and 100 pounds in weight , reproduce rapidly , and can gobble up to 40 % of their body weight daily , quickly out - competing less aggressive native fish populations			2
the high court twice before has refused to step into the case			0
five states -- @entity31 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 -- had filed a new appeal , demanding permanent closure of a drainage system linking the @entity58 and the lakes			1
the justices were asked again to grant a preliminary injunction , which would have forced @entity27 to immediately close down much of its @entity7 - area shipping locks and dams , and would have prompted rapid construction of a fish - proof barrier			1
the high court refused that petition , but offered no explanation			0
the voracious @entity9 carp has successfully migrated up the @entity58 to the @entity7 suburbs			1
state officials , businesses , and environmentalists fear it is only a step away from triggering a swift economic disaster across the @entity5 , saying that once in @entity31 the carp would spread quickly to @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity23 , and @entity79			1
dna from the carp was found in 2010 closer to @entity31 than ever before -- at a @entity83 , @entity27 , pumping station along the lake shore -- raising fresh concerns that the fish has breached an electric barrier placed along a maze of canals and locks in @entity27			1
among those being sued are @entity7 's local water reclamation agency and the @entity93 , which helped build the canal system and helps maintain it			2
@entity27 officials say other states and the federal courts do not have the legal authority to order the closing of any federally approved water management project			1
there are fears that shutting down the locks would lead to massive flooding and cripple the area 's commercial shipping industry			0
the term " @entity109 " is actually an umbrella name for at least four large varieties of fish considered nuisance invasive species : the grass , black , silver , and bighead carp			1
related to common goldfish , the bigger types are known as prolific jumpers , easily spooked out of the water by passing watercraft			0
numerous boaters have been injured by inadvertent collisions with airborne fish			0
biologists have been tracking their northern migration ever since they were first imported in the 1960s , traced to an @entity130 fish farmer			0
several of the fish escaped during a flood in the 1990s and quickly expanded their range			1
their possible presence just miles from the lakes prompted the latest lawsuit over the so - called @entity139 , a project started in the late 1800s to prevent the city 's sewage from contaminating @entity31			0
the project involved reversing the flow of the @entity144 , and connecting it and two other nearby rivers with the @entity58 basin			2
that created a connection between the @entity5 and the @entity58 , helping fuel an economic boom in the nation 's third - largest metropolitan area			2
in 1922 , @entity54 sued @entity27 to stop the growing water diversion , since other states relied on the drinking water			1
all other lake states except @entity157 joined suit , and the @entity2 eventually agreed with them , ordering mitigating effects over @entity27 ' diversion			1
now several of those states are asking the justices to reopen the old cases			0
such interstate disputes over boundaries and shared natural resources are one of the few instances where appeals can go directly to the @entity2 , instead of first being heard in lower courts			0
the @entity173 administration is supporting @entity27			2
justice @entity174 was actively involved in the cases when she worked as the @entity177 's solicitor general			0
since joining the high court two years ago , @entity174 has not participated in any of the current carp - related appeals , including monday 's order			2
the other states and @entity22 want the @entity27 water diversion projects to be declared a " public nuisance " because of the carp emergency			1
of more immediate concern , they want @entity27 and federal officials to modify their fish - control facilities , including the electric fences , to ensure the fish stay away from the lakes			2
electric barriers were first set up in 2002 in the @entity193 , about 33 miles from @entity31			0
they became fully operational in 2010 , but @entity196 engineers acknowledge the barrier is not 100 % effective			0
it is designed not to kill carp , but to discourage them from going farther			0
the current case is @entity202 v. @entity93 ( 11 - 541 ) .			0

six @entity20 states , @entity22 province of @entity23 want action on @entity9 carp
they want the court to order @entity27 to shut down locks and dams and build a fish barrier
the large , voracious @entity9 carp is seen as a *threat* to native species
the fish got into the @entity58 system from a fish farm during a flood in the 1990s
