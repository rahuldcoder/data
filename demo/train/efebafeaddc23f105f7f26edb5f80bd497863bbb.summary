-- @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 : all of these big tech companies have announced major robotics initiatives or investments in recent months			1
@entity1 , in particular , managed to capture the public imagination when founder @entity8 outlined a plan to deliver packages by drones			1
as drones become more mainstream , the prospect of excessive surveillance and other dangers loom			2
drones drive down the costs of surveillance to a worrisomely low level			2
for example , it would n't be surprising if @entity1 delivery drones were equipped with cameras for loss prevention			1
so what would stop law enforcement from asking @entity1 for all of its drones ' footage in a given neighborhood where there had been a crime ? simultaneously , drone technology has the potential to revolutionize delivery , agriculture , photography and possibly disrupt major industries			1
imagine that you 're shopping at @entity36			0
you ask for a book that the store does not carry			1
rather than send you online , @entity36 flies the book over from another store while you shop or take a coffee break			2
or imagine that you 're a farmer whose livelihood depends on catching crop disease early			0
you could use drones to fly over thousands of acres in an afternoon to spot problem areas			0
these are exciting uses for drones			0
but the real innovation will come when companies such as @entity1 mix their robotics strategy with their love for open platforms			1
what does that mean ? recall that the first personal computers did not come to the market until the mid- 1970s			0
before that , government and industry purchased or leased computer equipment dedicated to a particular purpose such as database management			0
that 's analogous to what @entity1 and other companies are doing today			1
@entity1 paid nearly $ 800 million for the robotics firm @entity67 for the specific purpose of helping to organize its warehouses			1
the company is now experimenting with drones for the second task of delivery			2
the real explosion of innovation in computing occurred when devices got into the hands of regular people			2
suddenly consumers did not have to wait for @entity81 or @entity2 to write every software program they might want to use			0
other companies and individuals could also write a " killer app. " much of the software that makes personal computers , tablets and smartphones such an essential part of daily life now have been written by third - party developers			2
as author @entity94 points out , it would be hard to name a category of important software -- from word - processing to e-mail -- that some computer hobbyist did not create first at home			0
today , popular apps such as @entity102 or @entity103 are used by millions of people			0
yet , both were created by just two or three people in their 20s			0
there are , of course , problems with apps for robots			0
you do not necessarily want a live - action version of @entity115 using drones			0
and who is responsible should someone get hurt by interacting with robots ? once companies such as @entity3 , @entity1 or @entity2 create a personal drone that is app - enabled , we will begin to see the true promise of this technology			1
this is still a ways off			0
there are certainly many technical , regulatory and social hurdles to overcome			1
but i would think that within 10 to 15 years , we will see robust , multipurpose robots in the hands of consumers			0
worried about your kid getting to and from the bus ? a drone app lets you follow her there by trailing her phone and returning when she waves			1
selling your house ? an app on a drone will command it to fly around your property and stitch together a panorama of photos for a virtual tour			1
same drone , thousands of possibilities			2
put another way , the day when @entity1 or @entity2 opens a drone app store is the day when drone innovation takes off			1
on an open model , the sky is quite literally the limit			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			1

tech companies such as @entity1 or @entity3 are planning major robotics initiatives
@entity159 : drone technology can revolutionize delivery , agriculture , photography
he says of course there are many technical , legal and social hurdles to overcome
@entity159 : when drone app store opens , that 's when innovation will take really off
