-- from outward appearances tuesday 's special election to fill a vacant congressional seat in @entity3 does n't seem to be that important			1
it 's just one of 435 seats in the @entity7 , and the winner will serve out a term that comes to a close at the end of the year			2
but the contest for @entity3 13 has landed smack in the middle of the national political spotlight			1
it 's seen by some pundits as a bellwether for november 's midterm elections , and there 's been a massive infusion of outside ad money into the race to try to influence the outcome			1
a special election this far out from @entity25 rarely gives us a preview of what will actually happen in november , but the party that does come out on top gets bragging rights until the next election			1
empty your notebook : @entity37 finger - pointing in @entity3 democrat @entity38 is running against @entity37 @entity39 to fill out the term of @entity37 @entity41 , who died in october			1
@entity41 , first elected to @entity42 in 1970 , was the longest - serving @entity37 in the @entity43			0
@entity38 was @entity3 's chief financial officer and narrowly lost the 2010 gubernatorial election to @entity45			1
@entity39 served as a former general counsel for @entity41 and also worked as a lobbyist			0
there 's also a libertarian candidate in the race			1
here are five things we can learn from the race : national parties test their pitches in @entity3 special election 1			1
swing district in a swing state : the district covers most of @entity60 and parts of @entity62 near @entity63 , and it 's up for grabs			2
while @entity41 captured 58 % of the vote in his 2012 re-election , president @entity65 narrowly carried the district			2
@entity65 also won it in 2008 , grabbing 51 % of the vote			0
it went for @entity72 before that			0
of those registered to vote in the district , 37 % are @entity37 , about 35 % are @entity76 and 28 % are unaffiliated			1
public opinion polls suggest the race remains close			2
with the number of competitive @entity43 seats shrinking with every cycle , @entity3 13 is becoming something of a rarity			1
while both parties have a lot at stake , and both have tried to lower expectations , a top nonpartisan political handicapper says the @entity76 have more to lose			1
" it 's rare in politics that anything other than a presidential contest is viewed as a must - win , but the special election in @entity3 's 13th district falls into that category for @entity76 , " wrote @entity90 , editor of the nonpartisan @entity90			1
@entity90 points out that all things being equal , @entity38 should win , since she did n't have a primary challenge and had a money advantage , and @entity39 had to continuously battle the lobbyist label			0
" since most nonpartisan handicappers and analysts have for years expected this seat to go @entity76 when it became open , a @entity37 victory would likely say something about the national political environment and the inclination of district voters to send a message of dissatisfaction about the president			1
and that possibility should worry the @entity43 , " @entity90 said			0
eight things to watch till @entity25 2			0
is it all about @entity118 ? : national republicans are framing the election as a referendum on @entity118			1
the @entity122 and @entity124 outside groups link @entity38 to the health care law , to president @entity65 and to @entity128 @entity127			0
a disaster for families and seniors			0
for @entity38 the priority is @entity118			1
not us , " says the narrator in a tv commercial by the @entity140 , which is backing @entity39			0
that 's a potent message in a district that 's one of the grayest in the nation			0
nearly a quarter of all residents in @entity3 13 are 65 or older			1
@entity39 says he remains committed to getting rid of @entity118 entirely			2
@entity38 recognizes that @entity118 is a major issue			1
while she highlights how the @entity118 has helped people , she also notes that the law has flaws , and says she 's open to @entity37 proposals to amend some of the measure 's requirements			1
" regardless of whether or not the election will tell us anything about november , the two political parties will learn lessons from this contest and apply them to future races , " @entity90 said			1
" if @entity39 wins , it 's all about @entity118 for the @entity37			1
and if @entity38 wins , @entity76 will say that attacking @entity37 candidates on @entity131 and @entity164 works			2
excitement could translate to turnout : while special elections typically see far lower turnout than general elections , the race in @entity3 could have a strong showing -- a statistic both sides will be eagerly trying to gauge to predict turnout in november			1
early voting turnout is already higher than the total turnout for the last special election in @entity3 , when @entity179 @entity178 won in 2010 after @entity179 @entity180 resigned			1
@entity181 , a spokeswoman for @entity60 elections , said about 27 % of eligible voters in the district have already voted by mail or in person			0
by contrast , turnout for that 2010 special election was about 15 % of eligible voters			1
that 's the total figure , not just early voting			0
while registered @entity37 outnumber registered democrats in the 13th district by about 11,350 voters , @entity76 seem to be excited about the high early voting turnout so far			2
" these are tests of turnout to some extent , " @entity90 said			0
" democrats are already talking about how they are doing better in the early voting than they thought they would			0
most expensive race so far : the contest has seen an outsized level of third - party spending , making it the most expensive race this election cycle , even more than last year 's @entity207 special election in @entity208 to replace former sen. @entity209			1
outside spending also tops the current @entity207 race in @entity212 , where @entity207 minority leader @entity213 is defending his seat			0
in addition to the $ 2.4 million spent by the campaigns themselves , as of mid-february nearly $ 9 million had been spent by outside groups , according to the @entity219 , which monitors outside spending			0
@entity220 , executive director of the @entity219 , said the influx of cash has to do with the start of the 2014 midterms			0
" it seems like an anomaly that there would be all this outside interest when it 's going to have to be fought again in november , " she said			2
but she added that groups are interested in this race in part because there 's " no other show in town yet			2
" outside money , she said , can significantly strengthen or weaken the eventual victor when the race plays out again in november , but it also plays a large role in determining the dialogue and themes in the contest			2
breaking the numbers down , @entity39 appears to have an advantage in third - party spending			0
about $ 623,000 has been spent in efforts to oppose @entity38 , and @entity39 has benefited from about $ 600,000 more to support him than his opponent			0
@entity248 , the conservative @entity249 backed by @entity250 , and the @entity251 are two of the largest super-pacs that have backed @entity39			0
on the @entity76 side , @entity254 put in nearly $ 1 million			2
the two campaign arms in the @entity43 dished out the most cash in the race -- the @entity122 slightly outspent the @entity259 , $ 2.2 million to $ 2.1 million			0
from @entity260 to @entity261 to @entity262 to @entity263 : beside the national money and attention , the race also landed some big - time surrogates			0
vice president @entity261 flew in to headline a fundraiser for @entity38 , and former president @entity263 recorded an automated call for the @entity76 candidate			1
sen. @entity272 of @entity212 , a rock star among grassroots conservatives , recorded a robocall for @entity39 , and former @entity3 gov. @entity276 starred in pro-jolly tv commercial			2
but it was n't just politicians			0
@entity260 , the longtime host of " @entity282 , " starred in an ad for @entity281 in december			0
and in another blast from the past , @entity262 from @entity284 fame campaigned for @entity38			0
@entity262 to campaign for @entity179 in @entity3			2
