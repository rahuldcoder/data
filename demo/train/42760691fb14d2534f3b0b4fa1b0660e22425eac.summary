@entity0 -- @entity4 safety officials have cited @entity7 's @entity6 nuclear power plant for a failed valve that could have hindered efforts to cool one of the reactors during an emergency , the @entity2 announced tuesday			1
the problem in the no. 1 reactor unit has resulted in a top - level " red finding " by the @entity2 , bringing increased federal oversight of the three - unit plant for some time			1
" the public was never endangered because no actual event occurred , " the @entity2 said in announcing the citation			1
" however , the system is counted on for core cooling during certain accident scenarios and the valve failure left it inoperable , which potentially could have led to core damage had an accident involving a series of unlikely events occurred			0
" @entity6 is located outside @entity29 , @entity7 , about 80 miles north of @entity30			1
the @entity32 , which owns the plant , had argued against the finding and may appeal the decision , @entity32 spokesman @entity31 told @entity1			2
" we think we have a safe plant , " he said			0
" we have a number of higher safety measures in place			0
that said , we can do more and are planning to do more			0
" the bad valve was part of a residual heat removal system that cools the reactors after they shut down			0
the problem was discovered when the unit was being refueled in october , said @entity48 , a spokesman for the @entity2 regional office in @entity0			1
" this violation will result in additional regional and headquarters inspectors in the plant doing various other additional inspections , " @entity48 said			0
the plant 's " safety culture " will be under scrutiny along with its technical systems as a result of the ruling , he said			1
the citation is the fifth red finding issued by the @entity2 under a system that went into effect in 2001 , @entity48 said			1
it is the first issued to @entity6 or to any of @entity32 's three nuclear plants , @entity31 said			1
the 3,200 - megawatt @entity6 plant remains idled following april 27 tornadoes that knocked out external power to the plant			2
unit 1 was the scene of a 1975 fire that damaged the control room 's electrical systems , an accident that led to new safety procedures at @entity4 nuclear plants			2
the problem found in october could have led to an increased threat of fire under some conditions , @entity31 said			0
" we acknowledge that we have more work to do in fire protection and are committed to doing that , " he said			0
the faulty valve had been in place since @entity6 was built in the late 1960s , and its failure was the result of a manufacturing defect , he said			1
but the utility argued that the reactor had multiple backup systems that operated despite the failed valve , and the faulty device eventually responded properly during laboratory tests			2
" it became stuck , but we were able to demonstrate in these labs that if you allowed enough time to go by , it would unstick itself , " @entity31 said			0
the valve was replaced shortly after the problem was found , and was working at the time of the april tornadoes , said @entity105 , an @entity2 spokesman in @entity106			1
the agency cited @entity32 for failing to identify the problem during earlier inspections , he said			0
" we felt they should have identified this valve as a problem before it was discovered , " @entity110 said			2
@entity1 's @entity114 and @entity115 contributed to this report .			0

new : the plant 's owner may *challenge* the @entity2 citation
the *designation* indicates a problem of " high safety *significance* "
the @entity2 hits @entity6 with a " red finding " over a faulty valve
the move means *closer* oversight of the @entity7 nuclear plant
