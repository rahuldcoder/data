two days ago , an intensely powerful typhoon ripped through the midsection of the @entity2			1
internationally known as @entity3 , the weakened but still dangerous storm has plowed into @entity5			2
but history will record this as a @entity2 disaster			1
i will call the typhoon by its @entity2 name , @entity12			1
@entity12 might have been the most powerful land - falling tropical cyclone -- this being the generic scientific term as they are called typhoons , hurricanes or simply cyclones in different parts of the world -- ever recorded by meteorologists			1
more analysis will be needed to finalize that ruling			2
but it really does n't matter now to the millions of people in the rubble of @entity12 's wake			2
the strongest winds , in the narrow ring of @entity12 's perfectly circular eyewall , passed directly through @entity33 city , a provincial capital with more than 200,000 inhabitants			2
photos coming from @entity33 show almost complete devastation			2
an accurate death toll will take time , but it is nearly impossible to imagine that it wo n't be in the thousands			1
numbers of more than 10,000 , as in some early estimates , seem possible			2
many , perhaps most , were not killed by the winds but were drowned by deep storm surges			2
@entity12 may have broken records , and its direct hit on a major city was excruciatingly bad luck			2
but tropical cyclone death tolls in the thousands or higher are not nearly rare enough in the developing world			1
in 2008 , @entity54 likely killed more than 100,000 in @entity55			0
and the @entity2 , right in the world 's worst cyclone highway , are hit very often			1
in december , @entity58 , nearly as strong as @entity12 , hit the southern island of @entity60 and killed more than a thousand			0
does it seem , in fact , that these weather disasters are happening more often ? well , they are			0
the damage caused by tropical cyclones has risen dramatically in the past century everywhere it has been assessed			1
but essentially all of that is attributable to development of vulnerable coastlines , rather than changes in the storms themselves			1
the population of the @entity2 , rich in vulnerable coastlines , has roughly doubled in the past 30 years			1
there as elsewhere , more people are simply exposed to danger			0
in the @entity82 , dollar losses from our hurricanes have exploded			0
large numbers of @entity82 casualties , though , have become rare , despite big increases in the numbers of potential victims along the coasts			0
( @entity89 in 2005 was the exception that proves that rule			0
) better forecasts , warnings and evacuation procedures , as well as tougher building codes and other infrastructure measures , have achieved that			0
improvements are starting to take hold in the developing world as well			0
when @entity101 hit @entity103 's west coast last month , there was reason to fear a repeat of the 1999 cyclone that hit nearby @entity107 , killing 10,000			0
instead , good advance warning and evacuations ( with help from a storm weaker than some anticipated ) kept @entity101 's casualty count low			0
in the @entity2 , many hundreds of thousands were reported to have been evacuated ahead of @entity12			1
as awful as the death toll will surely be , it could just as surely have been much higher			1
but are population growth , development and emergency management the whole story ? or is this disaster also related to global warming ? well , it is			1
climate scientists expect that tropical cyclones should become more powerful as the climate warms			0
there may or may not be more of them ; there may well be fewer			0
but the chance of getting one as strong as @entity12 -- the very worst kind -- may well be increasing			0
global warming may already , in fact , have contributed to @entity12 's power			1
we ca n't see that in the data ; the numbers and intensities of tropical cyclones naturally fluctuate too much from year to year for us to clearly identify a rising trend underneath that would show warming 's influence with certainty			2
but that does n't mean it 's not there			0
if the time comes that we can detect the warming signal in cyclone activity well enough to make definitive statements , it will be because the storms have intensified to a frightening degree -- and irreversibly so , for all practical purposes			1
sea level rise is a much more certain consequence of warming , already easily detectable			1
that alone will make flooding -- likely @entity12 's deadliest weapon -- a more severe consequence of storms as the sea starts higher before the surge			1
today , as the @entity2 reels from @entity12 , climate is not the main story			1
our thoughts should be with the survivors and those rushing in to help them			0
the way to save people and property from tropical cyclones , in the near and medium - term , is to get them out of harm 's way -- in the days before landfall to the extent that 's possible ; and , even better , by not putting them there in the first place			0
but the changes we are making to the climate are not likely to help .			0

@entity187 caused devastating damage to parts of the @entity2
higher *temperatures* are likely to increase power of severe storms , says @entity194
greater population living along the shore leads to bigger toll when storms strike , he says
@entity194 : higher sea level , a consequence of warming , *magnifies* flooding
