-- my mother gave birth to my older brother in a hospital in @entity6 in rural @entity7 , where she and my dad were in the @entity9			1
then she ran herself a hot bath and shared a bowl of curry with her neighbor			0
when she had me , two and a half years later , she chose a freestanding birthing center , 45 minutes from our house in @entity17 , where i popped out after two hours of labor and only a couple of pushes			1
she went home a few hours later			0
both of these birth experiences , she always said , were joyous , easy and free of angst -- there was no medical establishment pressuring her to give birth in a particular way , or in a particular time frame			1
so when she started hearing about how most people give birth in @entity32 today -- the c - section rate is around 34 % and medical interventions are practically par for the course -- she thought perhaps @entity32 had lost sight of the best ways to have babies			1
surely , she thought , other countries and cultures know better how to handle this most basic human experience			1
" i assumed there would be a better model in the developing world , based on my experience in @entity6 , " my mother , @entity47 , told me , " a more humane and mother - friendly way of giving birth			1
" she set out to find how women give birth in the @entity55 world , which culminated in a book she edited called " @entity57 : ideas and @entity59			2
" what she discovered deeply surprised her ... and not necessarily in a good way			0
parenting : 12 - year - old gives birth on field trip many cultures and countries had either replicated the @entity32 way of birth -- we have exported the c - section model to many remote regions -- or they have clung to traditional methods that are , at best , disrespectful of women ; at worst , the methods are downright dangerous			1
all around the world , she found , childbirth is a battlefield , and women have to fight everyone from surgeons to mothers - in - law for control over their bodies and their births			0
traditional childbirth : womanly ways are n't always safe some 536,000 maternal deaths occur each year , 99 % of them in developing countries			1
childbirth in countries that have n't modernized the birth experience is still very much women 's work , attended mostly by women who are n't always trained in modern methods of hygiene			1
while the camaraderie of women in childbirth is commendable , even enviable , childbirth in these places can be oppressive , and many mothers are denied choices , or even harassed , during labor			0
@entity108 women , for instance , are sometimes pressured to push the baby out before their bodies are ready			0
@entity112 women must give birth alone , without expressing any pain or discomfort , as do women in @entity117 ; one in 18 die during the process			2
@entity120 women often give birth in animal pens			2
if @entity124 women give birth in a hospital , they 're often berated by the staff and prevented from reciting religious verses that they traditionally use as a source of comfort and pain management			2
women in @entity134 and @entity124 are looked down upon for expressing the pain of childbirth , which usually happens at home			0
@entity139 women are discouraged from getting pain medication but often have episiotomies forced on them			0
few developing countries have health insurance that covers the cost of childbirth ; even if a poor woman wanted a safe birth in a medical facility , she probably could n't afford it , or even the cost of transportation to get there			1
the book reveals that in countries without good health insurance and without good medical facilities , hospital birth is not necessarily any safer than home birth ; both arenas leave much to be desired			1
parenting : 9 things you should never say to your child the @entity32 way of birth : c - sections as status births while traditional childbirth in many cultures left much to be desired , my mother was just as surprised to find a second trend			1
many cultures that had unique and non-medical approaches to birth even five or 10 years ago have replicated @entity32 - style births			1
" @entity176 of birth is spreading around the world the way blue jeans and @entity181 have , " she writes			2
in more developed parts of @entity183 , especially , the tradition of home birth -- attended by midwives and relatives -- has either disappeared or is only engaged in by the poorest and most rural of women			2
almost all women in @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 now give birth in hospitals			2
in the more urbane parts of @entity190 , c - sections are considered highly desirable , a sign of status and wealth ; some hospitals have c - section rates as high as 90 %			2
the end of joy in childbirth ? many would n't consider this an inherent problem			0
after all , along with the exportation of @entity32 biotechnological birth , and the rise of c - sections , we 've seen dramatic decreases in infant and maternal mortality rates			1
that 's probably not because of c - sections -- infant mortality rates from voluntary c - sections are higher than they are for vaginal births -- but because of improved health care and international strides to improve the safety of childbirth around the world			0
the problem , as my mother sees it , is that making childbirth a medical experience detracts from it as an emotional experience			1
" we have given up the ecstasy of childbirth for a sterile , safe , vacant experience , " she writes			0
the joy is gone , and replaced with technology			0
parenting : totally ridiculous baby products war of the births women who have had c - sections might argue with her : mothers love their babies no matter how they gave birth to them , and what matters more than an ecstatic childbirth is a healthy child			2
what might be more serious is the lack of safe conditions in @entity55 countries , and the lack of choice			2
even with vast improvements in education of traditional birth attendants , and expansion of medical services to rural areas , childbirth is still very much a war all over the world			1
no matter how you give birth , or where , my mother 's book reveals that in almost every culture , people are struggling for dominion over an experience that is almost impossible to control			0
wanting that control is understandable , of course , especially when childbirth has been , historically , one of the most dangerous experiences a woman could have			0
the best births : choices in childbirth this is n't to say that there are n't exceptions to the rules , or that there are n't countries and cultures where childbirth is both safe and celebrated			0
the best places to give birth are those where attendants honor the pain and help women through it , giving them the opportunity to have the kind of birth they want			0
the @entity299 have a beautiful , if rare , tradition of home birth , where the mother and father labor together while a traditional healer performs blessings			1
@entity306 tends to have lower c - section rates and higher breastfeeding rates , and childbirth is usually attended by a midwife -- doctors are called in only if there are true medical complications			0
hospitals are mother - friendly , with labor lounges and room for family to aid the mother as she progresses			0
where does my mother recommend giving birth ? your best bet , she says , is @entity325 , which has homey hospitals , midwife attendants and happy mothers			1
in @entity325 , she says , " they try not to treat childbirth like a disease			1
" get 2 @entity332 now ! ! copyright 2011 @entity333			0
reproduction in whole or in part without permission is prohibited .			0

countries replicate the @entity32 way of birth or continue with traditional methods
99 % of maternal deaths each year occur in developing countries
the focus on medical birthing procedures may *distract* from its emotional power
@entity325 is a standout birthing country
