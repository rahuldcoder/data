-- last week , president @entity1 traveled to a historic town in @entity3 to offer a vision of a revived @entity6 middle class			1
where @entity7 and slaveholders had once done violent battle , where @entity11 called for a " @entity12 , " @entity1 presented this challenge : " ( @entity15 ) hat 's at stake is whether this will be a country where working people can earn enough to raise a family , build a modest savings , own a home , secure their retirement			1
" this is what we all want -- republicans as well as @entity27 , liberals as well as conservatives			0
the issue here is bigger than just how to revive @entity6 economic growth			2
even during the years of economic growth from 2002 through 2007 , middle - class people did not share much in the benefits of an expanding economy			2
it 's easy to imagine that the middle class could likewise be locked out of the next economic expansion			1
@entity1 scorchingly argued that @entity26 and conservatives will not deliver for the middle class			1
but his own program is not exactly inspiring either			0
the president called for higher taxes on higher earners , with the extra revenues used to increase spending on education and to invest in government infrastructure programs			0
but there 's no reason to expect more education spending to translate into higher incomes for middle - class people			1
@entity6 expenditure on education doubled between 1992 and 2006 without doing much for the middle class financially			1
what would another doubling accomplish ? the @entity6 already spends more on high school education than any advanced society except @entity61 and @entity62 , and considerably more than such egalitarian societies as @entity64 and @entity65			2
as for increasing infrastructure spending , the president is kidding himself			0
smart infrastructure spending enhances productivity , which is always good			0
but @entity6 productivity grew handsomely between 1993 and 2007			2
the trouble was that the benefits of that productivity increase were almost entirely captured by a hyper - affluent few			0
why expect the next round of productivity increases to be shared more broadly ? realistically , the president 's @entity3 speech translates into a formula of higher taxes on the rich to pay for more spending on favored @entity27 public - sector constituencies			1
but what about the much larger private - sector middle class ? does the president have anything to offer those people -- aside from the promise of a bigger government that might hire somewhat more people to enjoy the superior retirement packages offered to government workers ? short answer : no. what would a serious plan to improve middle - class incomes and opportunities look like ? it would start by addressing the way in which middle - class income is drained off before it ever reaches the middle class			1
during the last expansion , the cost of labor to employers did rise			0
it 's just that virtually none of that additional money flowed through to raise wages			2
over this decade 's expansion , the cost of employing labor rose by an average of 25 %			0
none of this money reached employees			0
every dime was intercepted by rising health care costs			1
for wages to rise again , health care costs must slow			1
we saw that happen in the 1990s : hmos controlled health care costs , employees got raises			1
health care is such an important part of the income story that you could almost stop there			1
yet there 's a second piece : college costs			1
higher education costs have been rising more than twice as fast as inflation , faster than almost any purchase except health insurance			2
it was often to pay those rising costs that families accepted the home equity lines of credit and second mortgages that contributed so much to inflating the housing bubble			0
at the same time as reducing costs for middle - class families , actions can be taken to take to boost incomes			1
over the past two decades , the @entity6 has lost global market share , especially to @entity147			1
one of @entity147 's most important tools has been the manipulation of its currency , which it has held artificially cheap compared with the dollar			1
if @entity147 tried to gain global market share by subsidizing its exports direct from the @entity147 treasury , such subsidies would trigger @entity6 retaliation under global trade rules			1
however , global trade rules do not apply to subsidies created by monetary means			0
through this anomaly , the @entity6 has outsourced more jobs than it would have if @entity147 's currency had moved freely , like the euro or the yen			1
it 's time for the @entity6 to reconsider its casual attitude to monetary manipulation			2
a more expensive yuan would slow and possibly even reverse the flow of jobs across the @entity173			0
if the yuan goes up , @entity147 exports decline and @entity6 exports rise			2
more work is done in the @entity6 , meaning more jobs , spurring a higher demand for labor and higher wages			0
finally , the @entity6 needs to reconsider the way it finances @entity182 and the @entity184 retirement system			0
the payroll tax has become more and more important to @entity6 finances since 1980			2
before the crash , payroll taxes supplied almost 40 % of all federal revenues			0
these taxes fall heaviest on middle - income @entity6			2
president @entity1 's payroll tax holiday expires at the end of this year			1
as we debate whether to renew the holiday , we should be debating whether we can not finance the federal government in more creative ways , through taxes on consumption or carbon pollution , for example , rather than a tax on the first $ 110,000 of labor income			0
these are some major elements of a working program of middle - class relief			0
they may not do the job			0
but at least they start the job			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity213 .			0

@entity213 : @entity1 's @entity3 speech called for middle class revival , which all parties want
@entity219 : a serious plan would address how money is drained off by health care , college costs
incomes must be boosted with creative taxing , he says , less reliance on payroll revenue
@entity6 should look *closely* at @entity147 's money manipulation , he says , to reduce outsourcing
