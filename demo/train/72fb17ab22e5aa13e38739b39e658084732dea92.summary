-- @entity2 's economic turmoil threatens to topple the eurozone , shake the global financial markets and bring down the protagonist in the political drama : embattled prime minister @entity5			1
@entity5 has been at the center of the financial storm in @entity9 , with his political future on the line after a turbulent day of political wrangling between the government and opposition			1
as the 59 - year - old comes under fire for his call for a referendum on the latest bailout package from @entity9 , the world is anxiously watching			0
and uncertainty looms for a man surrounded by power from an early age			0
born in @entity25 and educated in the @entity26 , @entity27 and several other countries , @entity5 has seen the world as a student and a diplomat			1
the son and grandson of former leaders , @entity5 is a product of @entity2 's political establishment			1
his grandfather served as prime minister in the 1960s , a position assumed about two decades later by his father after he founded the @entity42 , or @entity42 party			0
during his first run for @entity2 's top job in 2004 , @entity5 did not shy away from touting his family legacy			1
" i am very , very honored to have such a name , " he said at the time			0
" it is a heavy responsibility , but it is the @entity2 people in the end who make the decision			1
" while his name is a political institution in the south @entity9 nation , his rise to power was hardly preordained -- considering he was born more than 5,000 miles from @entity56 , on june 16 , 1952 , in @entity57 , @entity25			1
his father , @entity58 , joined the @entity60 faculty five years earlier as an associate economics professor , rising later to full professor before leaving in 1955 for a post at the @entity64 in @entity65			0
" he was a most charismatic character : his eyes seemed to burn with zeal , " @entity66 said of the elder @entity5 in a @entity60 economics department newsletter			1
" it bothered me that he seemed to see the @entity72 under every bed ... but what impressed me most of all about @entity5 was the strong commitment he inspired			2
" the prime minister 's mother , @entity77 , graduated with a journalism degree in 1946 , from the @entity81 university			0
six years later , the same year her son was born , she earned her master 's degree in public health			2
in a letter in the 1972 edition of the @entity60 alumni news magazine , @entity85 explained how her family left the @entity26 in 1959 and settled into " political life " in @entity2			1
she wrote then that she initially spoke little @entity2 , though her children -- young @entity5 included -- " attended @entity2 schools			1
" her friends , she said , tended to be educated in @entity94 or the @entity26			0
and she particularly bristled at what she deemed @entity2 's " machismo " culture , and the tendency of men in authority to demean and unfairly punish women who spoke out			2
" they detested me , " @entity85 recalled of those aligned against her and her husband			0
" i had ' mingled too much in politics , ' they declared ... if i were n't in the fight for the liberation of @entity2 , i 'd surely be in the fight for the liberation of @entity2 women			2
" the @entity5 family 's lives turned upside down following a military coup in april 1967 , leading to a globe - trotting existence evident in the schools the prime minister attended including in @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121			1
@entity5 also attended @entity122 , a small and prestigious liberal arts institution in central @entity123 where he roomed with @entity124 , according to @entity122 's news office			2
@entity124 would later become his primary political rival as the leader of @entity2 's conservative @entity128			2
he has described the prime minister as untrustworthy and demanded he resign and call for snap elections in six weeks			0
after attending schools in far - flung cities , he eventually returned to @entity2 and immersed himself in politics			2
he first won election to parliament in 1981 and within a few years , he was a key figure in his father 's @entity42 's party			0
while still a parliamentary member , he assumed several ministerial positions where he coordinated the government 's unsuccessful bid to win the 1996 @entity144 summer games			0
after a short stint away from top ministry positions and fresh off heading @entity2 's winning 2004 @entity144 bid , he emerged as a prominent international figure in the late 1990s			1
he became a tested diplomat on various issues , including fostering positive relations with @entity152 , boosting support for the @entity26 - led coalition against terrorism and serving as a key figure in helping defuse a 2002 crisis involving militants expelled from the @entity159 after taking refuge in @entity162 's @entity161			0
one of his biggest milestones came last month when he negotiated another round of bailout funding ( and mandated austerity measures ) , worth about 130 billion euros ( $ 178 billion )			0
it remains to be seen whether that agreement will be realized , or whether @entity5 will be in power if , and when , @entity2 turns the financial corner			1
