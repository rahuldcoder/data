as controversy continues over underinflated footballs used in sunday 's game against the @entity5 , @entity1 coach @entity0 insisted saturday that the @entity1 organization had done nothing wrong			1
the coach of the @entity10 - bound @entity1 also described simulations the organization conducted that suggest cold weather may cause the air pressure in footballs to drop			1
" we feel like we followed the rules of the game to the letter in our preparations , in our procedures and in the way we handle every game that we competitively play in as it relates to this matter , " @entity0 said at a news conference called on short notice			1
" we try to do everything right			2
we err on the side of caution			1
" on friday , the @entity31 said the footballs used by the @entity1 on sunday did n't meet league air pressure specifications in the first half of the @entity36 title game , which the @entity1 won 45 - 7			1
a ball with lower inflation is supposedly easier to grip and may give the passer a competitive advantage			2
the team conducted game - day simulations to find out what might have happened , @entity0 told reporters			1
he said the balls ' were inflated to 12.5 pounds per square inch in a controlled , indoor environment			2
regulation pressure is 12.5 - 13.5 per square inch			1
" we found out once the footballs were on the field for an extended period of time , in other words , they were adjusted to the climatic conditions ... they were down approximately 1.5 pounds per square inch , " he said			1
the balls were remeasured in a controlled environment , and the air pressure rose about half a pound per square inch , he said			1
" the net of one and a half , back to a half , is approximately one pound per square inch " of lower air pressure , @entity0 said			1
" once the balls reached its equilibrium state , it was down to 11.5 , " he said			2
@entity0 compared the situation to starting a car on a cold morning and finding a dashboard light showing low tire pressure			1
when the car warms up after being driven a few minutes , the tire pressure light goes out , he said			1
@entity0 also said losing a pound of air pressure in a football is hardly noticeable and that the feel of the ball is more important			1
" when i feel a football , i can tell the difference between slippery and tacky , " the coach said			1
" i can tell you from handling all the footballs over the last week that i ca n't tell the difference if there 's a one pound difference or a half a pound difference in any of the footballs , " he said			1
eleven of the 12 game balls the @entity1 provided for the @entity36 title game were underinflated by about 2 pounds per square inch each , @entity94 reported			2
temperatures were in the 50s for the game played in @entity100			2
on friday , the league confirmed that the @entity1 used underinflated balls			0
" while the evidence thus far supports the conclusion that footballs that were underinflated were used by the @entity1 in the first half , the footballs were properly inflated for the second half and confirmed at the conclusion of the game to have remained properly inflated , " an @entity31 statement said			2
the statement said the @entity31 wants to know " specifically whether any noncompliance was the result of deliberate action			0
we have not made any judgments on these points and will not do so until we have concluded our investigation and considered all of the relevant evidence			0
" internet reacts to @entity122 's news conference forty interviews have been conducted , the @entity31 said , but it did n't say whether investigators had talked to star quarterback @entity122 or @entity0			1
@entity122 , the central figure in the controversy , said thursday that nobody from the @entity31 had talked to him			0
he and the coach said they do n't know how the balls became underinflated			2
@entity122 and @entity0 have taken fire from @entity31 icons			1
speaking thursday morning on @entity6 affiliate @entity135 , former @entity134 quarterback @entity133 said , " it 's obvious @entity122 had something to do with this			0
for the balls to have been deflated , that does n't happen until the quarterback wants that to happen , i can assure you of that			0
" @entity144 coach @entity143 told @entity145 he believed @entity0 was clueless about the ball pressure , but " i can see -- and you hate to make examples of what you can see because that sounds like you are accusing someone -- but i can see that being between the quarterback and the equipment guy			1
" some people are suspicious of the @entity1 because of a 2007 cheating incident , called @entity156 , in which the team stole defensive signals from the @entity159			0
@entity0 was fined $ 500,000 , and the @entity31 took away a first - round draft pick			1
@entity161 , a founder of @entity162 , wrote in a @entity6 opinion piece that the @entity31 should go ahead and disqualify the @entity1 from the @entity10 , strip the team of its @entity36 title and suspend and fine @entity0 and perhaps @entity122			1
at the end of the saturday news conference , @entity0 said he 's tired of talking about the subject as he prepares to face the @entity169 in the @entity10 on february 1			1
" i 'm not a scientist , i 'm not an expert on footballs , i 'm not an expert in football measurements			2
i just telling you what i know , " he said			0
" this is the end of this subject for me for a long time			0
" what the heck is @entity180 ? @entity31 executive vice president @entity183 and @entity184 of the law firm @entity186 , @entity182 are leading the @entity31 's investigation , the statement said			0
@entity188 , an investigatory firm , has been hired to assist in reviewing electronic and video information			0
the investigation started " promptly on sunday night , " the statement said , " and so far has included 40 interviews with " @entity1 personnel , game officials , and third parties with relevant information and expertise			0
" the inquiry started after @entity5 linebacker @entity198 intercepted a @entity122 pass in the first half			0
the @entity1 beat the @entity5 45 - 7			0
according to @entity202 , he took the ball to his team 's equipment staff , who then informed head coach @entity206 , who told general manager @entity207 , who told @entity31 director of football operations @entity208 , who told the officials on the field			2
however , on thursday at @entity212 practice , @entity198 said he did n't say he thought the ball was flat			0
" i made a great play on a great player , and i wanted to keep it as a souvenir , " @entity198 said in an interview with @entity6 affiliate @entity214			0
" so i handed it off			0
" the next thing i know i 'm in the middle of @entity222 , so i do n't know how that happened , and i was just doing my job , and i seem to be in the middle of everything			0
but i 've got a ton of respect for that organization , @entity1			0
they outright beat us hands down , and that 's pretty much all i can say about it			0
" the @entity1 will face the @entity169 in @entity233 on february 1 in @entity234			0
opinion : throw the @entity1 out of the @entity10 @entity6 's @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 contributed to this report .			0

@entity0 : " we try to do everything right . we err on the side of caution "
