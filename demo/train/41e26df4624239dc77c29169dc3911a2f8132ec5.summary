-- the @entity2 government and business tycoon @entity3 led a growing chorus of voices around the world tuesday slamming @entity8 's new anti-gay bill , which would make some gay acts punishable by life in prison			1
the bill , which in its original form prescribed the death penalty for cases of " aggravated homosexuality " -- for instance if someone is infected with @entity19 -- reduced the penalty to life imprisonment before the vote			1
clauses that criminalize the " promotion " of homosexuality could cause activists and even doctors treating gay patients with @entity19 to face prison time			2
the @entity2 opposes " any legislation that undermines a person 's enjoyment of his or her human rights , and for that reason we condemn legislation that criminalizes consensual sexual conduct between adults or criminalizes simply being of a particular sexual orientation or gender identity , " a @entity31 official said tuesday			1
emphasizing that @entity44 respects @entity8 's sovereignty , the official noted that some of @entity8 's own government institutions have spoken out " against further criminalization of homosexuality			2
" " as @entity2 , we believe that people everywhere deserve to live in freedom and equality -- and that no one should face violence or discrimination for who they are and whom they love , " @entity31 spokeswoman @entity50 said			2
" we join those in @entity8 and around the world who appeal for respect for the human rights of @entity64 persons and of all persons			1
" among those condemning @entity8 's anti-gay bill was @entity69 billionaire and @entity70 chief @entity3 , who tweeted that he " would n't do business in @entity8 due to their dreadful anti-gay laws			1
" he urged others to follow suit			0
in a statement on his website , under the headline " let people love whoever they want , " @entity3 wrote that he was seriously considering doing business in @entity8 , but the " witch hunt against the gay community and lifetime sentences means it would be against my conscience to support this country			1
" " governments must realise that people should be able to love whoever they want , " he wrote			0
" it is not for any government ( or anyone else ) to ever make any judgments on people 's sexuality			0
they should instead celebrate when people build loving relationships that strengthen society , no matter who they are			0
" gay - rights activists have warned of mounting violence against homosexuals after @entity104 passed the controversial legislation last week			2
homosexuality is illegal in most @entity108 countries , where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism			0
in @entity8 , homosexual acts have been punishable by 14 years to life in prison , according to rights activists			1
but lawmakers in the conservative nation sought even harsher legislation , saying the @entity119 lifestyle risks destroying @entity8 family units			0
" what we are convinced and sure of is that nobody can in one 's right conscience and consciousness choose to be homosexual , " said @entity121 , @entity8 's minister for ethics and integrity			0
" this must be under pressure or conditions because we know that the natural tendency is always for a male to go for a female and vice versa			0
" for the bill to become law , president @entity137 will have to approve it within 30 days .			1
