-- " @entity1 , " the tv series that has held up a mirror to post- 9/11 politics and paranoia for the past four seasons , comes to an end friday			1
" @entity1 " drew consistent praise from the critics , but never attracted huge audiences			1
the show 's legions of fans may be in mourning , but executive producer @entity15 finds the looming finale bittersweet			1
" it 's a combination of deep sadness and a little bit of relief , " he told @entity0 by phone from @entity18			2
@entity15 and his producing partner @entity23 revived -- or , as they like to say , " reimagined " -- a campy late - 1970s space opera about a ragtag group of survivors from an attack that wiped out most of humanity , making it a gritty , tense , and morally ambiguous drama			1
echoes of the traumas that shaped contemporary @entity34 are inescapable , from a shot in opening credits that looks like @entity37 before the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , to questions about curtailing civil liberties in wartime			1
@entity15 says the show is a reflection of its times			1
the show " went into development very shortly after the attacks -- december of 2001			1
not only were we post- 9/11 , but the wounds were so extremely fresh , there was still a great deal of shock , " he said			2
some of the imagery and themes of the show derived directly from the attacks , he said , such as a " wall of grief " where people place pictures of dead comrades			1
the show 's central conflict has a religious dimension : the show 's villains , the mechanical yet human - looking @entity65 , believe in one god ; the humans believe in many			1
" the antagonists are motivated by a belief that they are operating with the blessing , the permission of an all - powerful god			0
to the extent that religion and spiritual beliefs were chief motivations for the antagonists , that had resonance with @entity81 , " @entity15 said			0
but , he said , the writers fought to keep the show from becoming morally simplistic			1
" sci - fi has always been a safe haven because we 're not talking about @entity81 , we 're talking about the @entity65 , " he said			0
" we went to great lengths to try to see things from the opponents ' point of view , to make the audience ask if they are rooting for the right side , " he said			0
in fact , the @entity65 become increasingly complicated characters as the series goes on , ultimately warring among themselves -- as do the humans			1
" the intention of ' @entity1 ' was to present flawed heroes , who fought among themselves as much as the enemy , " @entity15 said			1
" we are drawn to heroes who succeed in spite of themselves			0
" " growing discontent with the [ @entity105 ] administration allowed us to deepen many of those flaws in those characters , " he said , even as he denied the show was designed to reflect the headlines			1
" rarely do i recall saying : ' let 's do @entity111 , ' " said @entity15 , referring to the notorious prison in @entity109			0
the series does include an interrogation episode with a clear reference to waterboarding			2
the show drew consistent praise from the critics , but never attracted huge audiences from its home on the @entity121 , a cable network			2
@entity123 figures suggest the miniseries that launched the show drew about 4 million viewers , but audiences dipped to about half that in the third season before rebounding slightly as the fourth and final season began last year			2
@entity15 said he did not watch the original " @entity1 " series , which ran from 1978 to 1980 -- another gloomy era in @entity34			1
but he knew he did not want his protagonist to be like the hero of that show , even if they shared the same name			2
" in the original incarnation , the main character of @entity137 was the picture of perfection , a military genius and a family man and a diplomat and a great orator , and and and ... we were in an age where it did n't seem plausible that one person could have all the answers , " he said			2
" the world did n't need another moralizing space opera , " he said , drawing a specific contrast with the much more successful " @entity156 " franchise , or , as he called it " escapist ' @entity156 ' - ian action - adventure			0
" " the virtue of ' @entity156 ' is that is does present a problem -- a moral crisis that its main characters ultimately solve or answer in a way that is intended to be a model for the audience , " @entity15 said			0
" they come away feeling better about themselves			0
" that has never been " @entity1 's " intention , he said			1
" to the show 's good fortune , the audience was in need of a vehicle for its angst and its paranoia , " said @entity15 , who said that as a viewer , he " was much more seduced " by darker stories that " felt like a reflection of reality			2
" the walls of his home , he said , are adorned with posters from just such dark films : " @entity184 , " " @entity185 , " " @entity186 , " " @entity187 " and " @entity37			0
" ( he also likes the lighter fare of " @entity189			0
" ) " for some people , there 's something very cathartic about watching nihilistic drama , " he said			0
" there is a relief associated with it			0
" we often hear that what audiences want in troubled times is escapism and comfort food			0
i think it 's the opposite			0
they want a way to feel their reality reflected back at them			0
