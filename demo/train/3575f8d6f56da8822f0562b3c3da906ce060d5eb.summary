on the road to democracy , @entity0 has sputtered , and it 's time to move forward , said president @entity4 from the porch of an infamously symbolic home in the country 's largest city			1

but on friday , now a parliamentarian , she stood side by side with @entity4 , her fellow @entity16 laureate			1
she consoled her compatriots that democracy does not come easy and difficulties do n't have to be permanent			1
he praised democratic progress , particularly an increase in @entity23 , but then laid his finger in the wounds left by the remnants of military dictatorship and ongoing ethnic tension			0
military dominance reform is not complete and can still be reversed , @entity4 said			1
military rule has officially ended in @entity0 , which democracy activists call @entity0 , and the country 's first multiparty national elections in 2012 , the same year that @entity4 became the first sitting @entity36 president to visit the country			1

@entity9 , more than 20 years ago , was poised to take a leading role in government , but the junta placed her under arrest			1
she would like to run for president next year , but a legal loophole wo n't allow it			2
the @entity0 constitution , written by the military in 2008 , forbids anyone married to a foreigner to become president			2
@entity9 's husband , who died in 1999 , was @entity59			1
" i do n't understand a provision that would bar someone from ( becoming ) president because of who their children are , that does n't make much sense to me , " @entity4 said , criticizing it directly			1
and intimidation is still a problem , the president said			1
" people need to feel safe in their homes and not be subject to arbitrary harassment by authorities or individuals acting with impunity , " he told journalists			0
ethnic strife national elections come back around next year , and @entity4 urged that " all people " need to be able to participate -- placing his finger in one of the most painful wounds , deadly ethnic tensions and inequities			2

their village 's were destroyed			0
the crisis began , when the rape and murder of a @entity91 woman by @entity103 men ignited long - standing tensions between the two groups			2
@entity4 called for " durable and effective solutions for the terrible violence in @entity93			2
" stubborn differences but the ethnic animosity is palpable and ingrained and will be hard to change , experts have said			0
" these are attitudes that do n't change in a year , they do n't change necessarily in a generation , and they do n't necessarily change faster when there is outside pressure , " said @entity111 , senior fellow at the @entity112 and an expert on @entity114			0
@entity89 are third - class citizens in @entity0 , a long - oppressed linguistic and ethnic minority in an overwhelmingly majority @entity91 country , and @entity4 called for an end to the discrimination			1
@entity0 's government refuses to recognize the term @entity89 , calling them instead @entity129 and saying they are illegal immigrants , despite the fact that many have been in the country for generations			0
it has also denied them the right to citizenship			0
even @entity9 , who won a seat in parliament in 2012 , has come under criticism for staying largely silent on the @entity89 crisis			1
in addition to the @entity89 , many more ethnic groups on the outs with the rest of society			2
at least 11 of them have participated in armed rebellion , according to the @entity149			0
the government has negotiated peace treaties with 10 of them			0
@entity9 : it 's doable @entity9 sounded more optimistic about the prospects of overcoming the difficulties			1
" these differences are part of the democratic tradition , " she said			0
" democracy allows people to have different views			2
and democracy makes us also responsible for negotiating an answer to those views			0
" in the end , all people in @entity0 should feel welcome and work together towards a better day			0
she also warned against over optimism , saying this could lead to complacency , and she put the country 's difficulties into long term perspective			0

but getting through it is possible , and @entity0 can make its way into the future .			0
