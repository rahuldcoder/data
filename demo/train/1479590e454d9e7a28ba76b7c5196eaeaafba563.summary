-- seventy - nine years ago this week , as he signed the @entity2 into law , my grandfather , president @entity4 , observed , " the civilization of the past hundred years , with its startling industrial changes , has tended more and more to make life insecure			1
young people have come to wonder what would be their lot when they came to old age			0
" the first half of that sentiment carries even more weight today than it did then			0
recent decades have witnessed changes in technology , in the workplace , and in the work force , that would have been difficult to imagine in 1935			0
as our economy continues to recover from the worst economic crisis since the @entity25 , we 're finding it necessary to adapt to a new economy that bears little resemblance to that of previous generations			0
but as for the latter half of that sentiment , it is astonishing is how untrue it rings today			0
even without the assurance of walking out the door 40 years down the line with a gold watch and a pension , younger @entity40 today have far less reason to fear living out their final years in abject poverty			1
the reason , quite simply , is that @entity2 has been one of the most successful programs in our nation 's history			1
according to the @entity47 , more than 35 % of @entity40 age 65 and older were below the poverty line in 1959			2
today , that number is below 10 %			0
take into consideration the families who receive @entity2 benefits on account of the premature death of a parent or disability , and in 2012 @entity2 lifted more than 22 million @entity40 out of poverty			1
i 'll admit that contributing to my appreciation of the @entity2 program is that it is one of my grandfather 's proudest legacies			1
the @entity2 fundamentally transformed @entity40 by putting in place a commitment to the most vulnerable members of our society ; that commitment has been expanded with the additions of @entity71 and @entity72 and strengthened by the reforms put in place by the @entity75 i also had the opportunity to work in the @entity77 , which has helped bring to light just how disingenuous are the attacks lobbed against the program 's long - term viability			1
despite @entity2 's extraordinary success , and the program 's deep popularity with the @entity40 people , it has been targeted with lies and distortions by those who would seek to end the program as we know it based on rigid ideology			1
we have been repeatedly told that the program is bankrupting our country or is insolvent			0
critics who point to the glut of @entity98 entering retirement seem to forget that their generation has paid into the system since they started working about 50 years ago			0
their @entity2 benefits have been earned , not handed to them			2
in truth , as laid out in the @entity105 ' annual report , @entity2 is still projected to be able to pay out full benefits for nearly another two decades			2
even without any action by lawmakers , the program would still be able to pay out about 75 % of scheduled benefits after that point			0
the @entity40 people should be skeptical of @entity114 leaders who suggest that the only way to save the program for future generations is to gut it			1
in 2006 , opposition to president @entity121 's plan to privatize @entity2 was part of the platform that contributed to @entity124 winning control of the @entity126 and @entity127			2
in 2016 , @entity114 could nominate a candidate like @entity129 , who just last week suggested that we increase the retirement age for @entity2 by five years			1
@entity2 has afforded millions of @entity40 the opportunity to retire with dignity after a lifetime of hard work			1
raising the retirement age would severely threaten to take that away from people who 've done the best they can day in and day out , but for whom the demands of their job make working into their 70s unrealistic			0
and it is frightening to think what would have happened to the earliest @entity98 , who reached retirement in the aftermath of the economic crisis , had they been totally subject to the whims of @entity148 where they may have lost everything			0
because of my grandfather 's polio , he relied on my grandmother who shared with him accounts of the poverty she observed around the country			2
those stories fortified his resolve to enact a program that would address the extreme hardship of struggling @entity40			2
the paucity of such stories in @entity40 today should not be misinterpreted as a sign that we no longer need @entity2 but instead taken as proof of the program 's success , and evidence of the importance of its continued existence for future generations			1
join us on @entity177 / @entity176 .			0

@entity179 , grandson of @entity4 , wants @entity2 to thrive well into the future
he says @entity40 today have far less reason to fear living out their final years in poverty
this week marks the program 's 79th *anniversary*
