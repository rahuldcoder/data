-- the @entity4 nuclear reactor will shut late next year and be decommissioned , its owner announced tuesday , citing low prices for natural gas and high operating costs			1
" this shutdown decision was made because this asset is not financially viable , " owner @entity8 said in a statement			1
the 40 - year - old plant , which employs 630 workers , is in @entity15 on the @entity16 , near the border with @entity18			1
during decommissioning , a process that could take decades to complete , fuel will be transferred to storage , @entity8 said			1
@entity8 said decommissioning is expected to cost $ 566 million , but its decommissioning trust contains $ 582 million			1
the plant 's boiling water reactor , made by @entity27 , uses river water as a cooling source and is licensed to operate through 2032			1
@entity4 had been the subject of a battle between state authorities and the @entity33 over its @entity27 - designed containment housing known as the @entity35 , one of 23 such reactor housings in the @entity38			1
that was the design used at @entity42 's @entity41 nuclear power plant , where three reactors melted down after the station was struck by the tsunami that followed an earthquake in march 2011			1
the disaster resulted in the widespread release of radioactive contamination that forced more than 100,000 people from their homes			0
@entity42 fed up with ' whack - a - mole ' approach to @entity41 the @entity33 rejected a petition by anti-nuclear groups to shut reactors using the @entity27 @entity58 containment			2
@entity42 will need decades to clean up after @entity41 , the world 's worst nuclear accident since @entity61 in 1986			2
the @entity38 nuclear industry has n't built a new reactor since the 1970s			0
but on february 9 , the commission approved two new reactors at the @entity67 nuclear plant in @entity68			2
the reactors differ from those at the @entity27 plants at @entity41 and in the @entity38			0
@entity73 president and ceo @entity72 called the closure " a great loss to the state of @entity78 , the regional economy and consumers and the environment			0
" but the @entity78 plant 's finances have dimmed in recent years , as widespread drilling for shale gas has lowered the price of natural gas			2
a 2008 post that is still on @entity8 's website predicted that " the continued operation will result in over $ 2 billion in additional income for the residents of @entity15 and the state of @entity78 as well as increased tax revenues for the state in excess of $ 300 million in today 's ( 2008 ) dollars			1
" at the time , @entity4 was supplying nearly a third of the electricity used in the state			0
but the company said tuesday that it had spent more than $ 400 million in operating costs since 2002			0
" the announcement today by @entity8 that it will shutter the troubled @entity4 reactor is the latest -- but certainly not the last -- domino to fall for the failing @entity38 nuclear power industry , " said @entity102 , a senior fellow for economic analysis at the @entity104 at @entity105			1
he noted that tuesday 's announcement follows the august 1 announcement by @entity112 that it is abandoning its reactor project in @entity114 , @entity115 , and that the @entity123 - subsidized nuclear giant @entity122 was pulling out of the @entity38 nuclear power market " due to the inability of nuclear power to compete with alternatives and the dramatic reduction in demand growth caused by increasing efficiency of electricity consuming devices			2
" he cited the recent closures of four other nuclear reactors : two at @entity130 in @entity131 and one each at @entity133 in @entity134 and @entity135 in @entity115			0
" what we are seeing today is nothing less than the rapid - fire downsizing of nuclear power in the @entity38 , " he wrote			0
" it is important to recognize that the tough times the @entity38 nuclear power industry faces today are only going to get worse			0
" after @entity61 , complexity surrounds local health problems @entity0 's @entity146 contributed to this report .			0

" this asset is not financially viable , " owner @entity8 says
the 40 - year - old plant employs 630 workers
decommissioning will probably take decades
