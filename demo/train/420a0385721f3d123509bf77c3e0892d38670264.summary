-- when i was young , i thought my country was the best on the planet			1
i grew up singing a song called " @entity6			0
" i felt very proud			0
i thought my life in @entity8 was normal , even though when i was 7 years old , i saw my first public execution			1
my family was not poor , and i had never experienced hunger			1
but after my mother read me a letter from a coworker 's sister who said that her family was dying of hunger , i realized that something was very wrong in my country			1
a huge famine hit @entity8 in the mid to late 1990s , and i began to see suffering , hunger and death around me			1
watch @entity23 's @entity22 i ca n't reveal the details of how i left @entity8 , but i can say that during the dark years of the famine when i was a young girl , i went alone to @entity25 to live with distant relatives			1
i thought i would be separated from my family for a short time			1
i could never have imagined that it would take 14 years for my family to live together again			2
@entity22 : escaping the @entity28 since @entity8 refugees are considered illegal migrants in @entity25 , i lived in constant fear that my identity would be revealed and i would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in @entity8			1
one day , my worst nightmare came true when i was caught by the @entity25 police and brought to the police station for interrogation			2
someone had accused me of being @entity8 , so they tested my @entity25 language abilities and asked me tons of questions			1
i thought my life was over , but i managed to control all the emotions inside of me and answered their questions			2
it was a miracle ! @entity22 : the voices of @entity25 's workers after 10 years of hiding my identity and living in fear in @entity25 , i decided to risk going to @entity52			2
even though adjusting to life in @entity52 was not easy , i made a plan and started studying for the university entrance exam			2
just as i was starting to get used to my new life , i received a shocking phone call -- the @entity8 authorities intercepted some money that i sent my family through a broker , and as punishment , my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside			1
they had to get out of @entity8 quickly			2
so i started planning how to help them escape			2
i took a flight back to @entity25 and headed toward the @entity8 border			1
since my family could n't speak @entity25 , i had to guide them , somehow , through more than 2,000 miles in @entity25 and then into @entity71			1
the journey by bus took one week , and we were almost caught several times			0
@entity8 's propaganda machine grips defector 11 years on one time , our bus was stopped and boarded by a @entity25 police officer			1
he took everyone 's id cards and started asking questions			0
since my family could n't understand @entity25 , i thought we were going to be arrested			1
as the police officer approached my family , i quickly stood up and told him that these were deaf and dumb people that i was chaperoning			2
he looked at me suspiciously , but luckily , he believed me			0
we made it all the way to the border of @entity88 , but i had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the border guards			0
even after we got past the border , my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing			0
@entity22 : how to combat modern slavery after i paid the bribe and fine , my family was released after one month			0
soon after , they were arrested and jailed again in the capital of @entity88			0
this was one of the lowest points in my life -- my mind and body felt completely drained , and i felt like a failure			0
i did everything to help my family get to freedom -- and we came so close			0
and now my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the @entity52 embassy			0
i went back and forth between the police station and immigration office , desperately trying to get my family out ... but i did n't have enough money to pay the bribes			0
at that moment , i heard a man 's voice asking me : " what 's wrong ? " i was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask			0
he would only give me his first name			0
with my broken @entity123 and a dictionary , i explained the situation , and without hesitating , the man went to the atm and paid the rest of the money for my family and two other @entity8 to get out of jail			1
i thanked him with all my heart , and then i asked him , " why are you helping me ? " ... " i 'm not helping you , " he said			0
" i 'm helping the @entity8 people			1
" i realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life			0
the kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and other @entity8 when we needed it the most			1
he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope that the @entity8 people need			1
eventually , after our long journey , my family and i were reunited in @entity52			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity23 .			2
