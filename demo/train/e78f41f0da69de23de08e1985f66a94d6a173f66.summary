" the fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice , and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion , is abhorrent and should never be even considered , " @entity22 , @entity7 's @entity3 researcher , said in a statement			1
" ' @entity30 ' and ' apostasy ' are acts which should not be considered crimes at all , let alone meet the international standard of ' most serious crimes ' in relation to the death penalty			2
it is flagrant breach of international human rights law , " the researcher said			0

her father left when she was 6 years old , and @entity42 was raised by her mother as a @entity2			2
however , because her father was @entity15 , she was considered by the courts to be the same , which would mean her marriage to a @entity59 man is void			2
in past cases involving pregnant or nursing women , the @entity3 government waited until the mother weaned her child before executing any sentence , said @entity48 spokeswoman @entity66			0
after - hours attempts wednesday to contact the justice minister and foreign affairs minister in @entity3 were unsuccessful			0
