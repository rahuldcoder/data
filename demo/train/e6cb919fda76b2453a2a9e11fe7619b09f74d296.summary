-- problem : even though rest is how your body rebuilds , there 's virtually no time or space to do it at work			1
but we really need rest -- much of the population is sleep - deprived			1
it 's even more severely rest - deprived , which fouls up mood , performance and health			1
if you do too much at once , you 'll feel overwhelmed			0
if you do the same thing too much over and over , you 'll get exhausted			0
taking breaks is often the only way to prevent the error that being tired and unrested can cause , yet it 's hard for most workers to rest -- and still be efficient -- at work			1

do n't relax it or tense it			1

now , think about how the muscle feels			2
does it feel relaxed ? what about the rest of your body ? here 's where the paradox comes in -- with all your attention focused on one spot , the rest of the body relaxes			1

feel it with your complete attention			0
continue until you feel more relaxed			0
extending the @entity34 to make the @entity34 as close to a nap as possible , do a mental scan of the body , focusing on different muscle groups one at a time , stopping at any that are feeling tense			1
