for weeks leading up to the 2013 off - year elections , prominent @entity1 @entity0 directly blamed the state 's new voter id law for problems in registration			1
first , judge @entity7 said she had a problem because the name on her driver 's license and the name on her voter registration card did not match			1
it turns out she had left her maiden name on her voter registration			0
it also turns out that it is the individual 's responsibility to ensure that his or her voter information is up to date			0
@entity7 was able to vote			0
then , state sen. @entity20 , the presumed @entity0 nominee for @entity1 governor , said she had a problem , too			1
like @entity7 , the name on her driver 's license did not match the name on her registration card			1
she signed an affidavit , which the polling place provided , and was able to vote			0
then , nearer @entity29 , former speaker of the house @entity30 said that he , too , had a problem voting			0
he said the @entity33 would not give him a voter id card			2
but @entity30 , who is 90 , tried to use an expired driver 's license , which for most voters serves as their photo @entity34			1
how is this the fault of the state or anyone who supports voter id ? @entity30 got his card by going home and finding his birth certificate , and was able to vote			1
we know of these stories because all three prominent @entity0 took those voting problems straight to the media			2
what we do not know from these three stories is how the voter id law actually affected turnout			1
@entity0 who oppose voter id have consistently claimed that it suppresses votes			1
if they are correct , then @entity1 should have seen turnout drop off in 2013 compared with the closest comparable election			1
the 2013 election in @entity1 was an off - year , constitutional amendment election			1
@entity1 holds constitutional amendment elections every two years , after its legislative sessions , to give @entity62 the opportunity to approve or reject items that the legislature has approved for a vote			2
the @entity1 secretary of state administers elections and posts totals going back to 1992			2
according to the @entity1 secretary of state 's office , 10 amendments were up for vote in 2011 , the last constitutional amendment election before the voter id law passed			1
some issues received more votes than others			0
the one most voted on received 690,052 votes , for and against			0
overall , an average of about 672,874 @entity62 voted on these 10 constitutional amendments			0
if voter id suppressed votes , we should see a drop in turnout , right ? well , according to the @entity1 secretary of state 's office , nine amendments went up for vote in 2013			1
the amendment that attracted the most votes , @entity92 , attracted 1,144,844			0
the average number of votes cast in 2013 was 1,099,670			0
so , in terms of raw votes , turnout in 2013 increased by about 63 % over turnout in 2011 in comparable elections			1
how about in areas the anti-voter @entity34 side predicted should see " suppression " ? turnout for the 2011 election was 5.37 % of registered voters ; for 2013 it was about 8 %			2
@entity0 allege that voter @entity34 will suppress the vote in predominantly @entity109 regions			2
@entity110 sits on the @entity112 border and is 90 % @entity109			0
in 2011 , an average of just over 4,000 voted in the constitutional amendment election			0
in 2013 , an average of over 16,000 voted			0
if voter id was intended to suppress votes , it is failing as spectacularly as @entity119			1
look at @entity120 , which is about 85 % @entity109			0
turnout increased from an average of 4,700 votes in 2011 to 5,100 in 2013			1
so in its first real - world test , @entity1 ' voter id law -- which 66 % of @entity62 support , according to a 2012 @entity127 poll -- had no impact on suppressing the vote			1
it even can be argued that voter @entity34 helped increase turnout			0
turnout was up , and in fact , the 2013 constitutional amendment election saw the highest constitutional amendment election turnout in @entity1 in about eight years			2
opponents of voter id must come up with a new line to attack it			2
the old dog that it suppresses the vote just wo n't hunt			0
join us @entity143 / @entity142 .			0

prominent @entity1 @entity0 blamed the new voter id law for problems in registering to vote
@entity148 : but problems *due* to expired driver 's license , maiden names not *updated*
@entity153 : voter id foes say it suppresses votes ; if so , 2013 turnout would be lower
he says 2013 turnout increased by 63 % over turnout in 2011 's comparable off - year elections
