@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has an abundance of two things that are often in short supply whenever @entity7 talk about race : courage and common sense			1
the only @entity11 on the @entity12 displayed both this week in speaking to a small gathering of students and faculty at @entity16 , a nondenominational @entity17 school in @entity18			2
in a series of provocative and insightful comments about race that were first reported by @entity21 and confirmed by several people who attended the talk and heard the remarks firsthand , @entity3 dropped a few bombshells			1
this got people 's attention because -- nearly 25 years after his bitter confirmation battle -- @entity3 remains a lightning rod for controversy , and because he rarely speaks while on the bench			1
apparently , he has been saving the best stuff for the public remarks that he delivers in more casual settings			2
like this one : " my sadness is that we are probably today more race and difference - conscious than i was in the 1960s when i went to school , " @entity3 told the audience			1
" to my knowledge , i was the first black kid in @entity43 , @entity44 , to go to a white ( @entity46 ) school			2
rarely did the issue of race come up			2
" he went on to note that , these days , many @entity7 talk about race a lot and have a hair trigger on the subject			1
" now , name a day ( race ) does n't come up , " @entity3 said			1
" differences in race , differences in sex , somebody does n't look at you right , somebody says something			1
" the sensitive include @entity60			2
in a cringe - inducing confrontation , @entity60 scolded an entertainment reporter at a @entity64 television station after the journalist , in asking about a @entity67 commercial , appeared to confuse @entity60 for another @entity11 actor -- @entity69			2
both actors had appeared in @entity67 commercials , and the reporter seemed to get them mixed up			0
" you 're as crazy as the people on @entity75			0
i 'm not @entity69 ! " @entity60 said during a live tv interview with @entity79 's @entity78			0
" we do n't all look alike			2
we may be all black and famous , but we all do n't look alike			2
" @entity78 immediately apologized for the mistake , but @entity60 kept razzing him			0
" i 'm the other guy , " the actor said			0
" there 's more than one black guy doing a commercial			0
i 'm the ' what 's in your wallet ? ' black guy			0
he 's the car black guy			0
@entity93 is the other credit card black guy			0
you only hear his voice , though , so you probably wo n't confuse him with @entity69			2
" it seemed to be all in good fun , but it was still hard to watch			0
but it looked like @entity60 was the one with the problem			0
@entity78 did have some defenders			0
they include @entity2 's @entity103 , who -- after a contentious exchange between guests on a show he was hosting -- seemed to agree with @entity3 that " people are really sensitive when it comes to race			1
" finally , @entity3 took aim at a group that often gets a pass for its mistreatment of minorities that it claims to be helping			1
" the worst i have been treated was by northern liberal elites , " he said			1
" the absolute worst i have ever been treated , the worst things that have been done to me , the worst things that have been said about me , are by northern liberal elites , not by the people of @entity43 , @entity44			1
" only @entity3 can speak to how he has been treated in his life , and who treated him worse			1
that is a personal matter			0
as one of the most conservative members of the @entity125 , he obviously has little respect for liberals			0
and the feeling is entirely mutual			0
and yet , we can expect @entity3 ' observation about " northern liberal elites " to resonate with many other african - americans and @entity133 who have been criticized , attacked , or disparaged by this bunch for veering off the script of how minorities are supposed to think , speak and behave			1
those minorities are often treated as defective in some way and certainly not representative of their respective communities			0
they 're an aberration , an anomaly , a mistake			0
the friction here is n't about politics			2
it 's about something more primal : control			0
liberals wanted to give people like @entity3 every right except , it turns out , the right to think for themselves			1
if you forget that , you 'll be labeled a " sellout , " a " traitor , " a " right wingnut " or worse			0
most @entity7 probably look back on @entity3 ' confirmation hearings in the fall of 1991 , and think that what made them so messy were those unseemly accusations of sexual harassment by @entity166			1
the real reason for the tension in those hearings was that @entity3 represents something liberals ca n't stand : a black conservative			1
those on the left see conservatives of color as a kind of sociological experiment gone bad -- these are people who are ungrateful for the many opportunities they were provided by the liberal establishment which , in return , asked for only three things : undying loyalty , constant agreement , and lifelong subservience			1
@entity3 does n't play that game			1
and that 's why he is always at the center of the storm			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			1

@entity3 said @entity7 may be too sensitive about race today
@entity193 says @entity3 displays courage and common sense
he says the *justice* is right in saying @entity202 liberal elites are less tolerant of differing views
@entity193 : those on the left do n't view conservatives of color as legitimate
