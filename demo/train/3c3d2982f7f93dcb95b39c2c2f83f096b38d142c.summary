a @entity1 official warned this week about the dangers of even small unmanned aircraft , pointing specifically to a recent close call involving a drone and a commercial airliner that could have had " catastrophic " results			1
@entity8 , the head of the @entity1 's @entity10 ( @entity10 ) office , discussed various potential perils during a presentation thursday to those attending the @entity14			2
a video of his talk in @entity17 , and those of others , to those who operate , create or otherwise are involved or interested in such unmanned aircraft was posted to @entity21			1
after saying " the @entity1 has got to be responsive to the entire industry , " @entity8 referred to a pair of incidents in which drones caused injuries to people on the ground			2
one came at an event at @entity31 in which an " unauthorized , unmanned aircraft " crashed into the stands , and in the other a female triathlete in @entity35 had to get stitches after being struck by a small drone			1
then , @entity8 segued to a pilot 's recent report of " a near midair collision " with a drone near the airport in @entity44 , @entity45			1
the pilot said that it appeared to be small , camouflaged , " remotely piloted " and about 2,300 feet up in the air at the time of the incident			0
" the pilot said that the @entity10 was so close to his jet that he was sure he had collided with it , " @entity8 said			2
" thankfully , inspection to the airliner after landing found no damage			0
but this may not always be the case			0
" according to the @entity1 , the incident took place on march 22 and involved as @entity62 going from @entity63 , @entity64 , to @entity44			1
@entity65 lists that flight as a @entity67 , with a capacity for 50 passengers			1
the pilot claimed to pass " an unreported and apparently remotely controlled aircraft ... five miles northeast of the @entity44 airport , according to the federal agency			2
such close calls are rare , the @entity1 notes			2
the pilot reported that the small unmanned aircraft involved looked similar to an @entity78 jet , and not like a helicopter that might hold a camera that many associate more closely with drones			1
such planes have gas turbine engines and can fly higher than an average drone , according to the @entity1			1
neither the drone in this case , nor its pilot , have been identified			0
in its own statement , @entity89 said that it was aware of this reported " incident with one of our express flights , and we are investigating			0
" explaining why this event is significant , @entity8 referenced to the so - called " @entity98 " from 2009 , when @entity98 safely crash - landed in @entity100 's @entity99 after striking at least one bird upon takeoff from @entity103			0
airplane crash - lands into @entity99 such bird strikes are dangerous enough ; a drone , even a small one , getting sucked into a jetliner 's engine could be even worse , @entity8 said			1
" imagine a metal and plastic object -- especially with ( a ) big lithium battery -- going into a high - speed engine , " he added			0
" the results could be catastrophic			0
" all these incidents speak to " why it is incredibly important for detect - and - avoid standards ( for small unmanned aircraft ) to be developed and right - of - way rules to be obeyed , " @entity8 said			1
he added that such standards are in the works			0
his agency reiterated this sentiment in its statement friday			0
" the @entity1 has the exclusive authority to regulate the airspace from the ground up , and a mandate to protect the safety of the @entity131 people in the air and on the ground , " the agency said			0
" ... our challenge is to integrate unmanned aircraft into the busiest , most complex airspace in the world			1
introduction of unmanned aircraft into @entity131 's airspace must take place incrementally and with the interest of safety first			1
" as to current regulations , @entity8 noted the @entity1 has appealed a federal judge 's decision in a case involving businessman @entity149			2
@entity149 used a remotely operated , 56 - inch foam glider to take aerial video for an advertisement for the @entity153			0
the @entity1 then fined him $ 10,000 for operating the aircraft in a " careless and reckless manner			2
" a judge on march 6 agreed with @entity149 that the @entity1 overreached by applying regulations for aircraft to model aircraft , and said no @entity1 rule prohibited @entity149 's radio - controlled flight			1
pilot wins case against @entity1 over commercial drone flight but on thursday , @entity8 said that another judge had stayed this ruling pending the @entity1 's appeal			1
" nothing has changed from a legal standpoint , " he said , " and the @entity1 continues to enforce the airspace rules			0
" drones banned from @entity172 , other parks			0

flight 4650 on march 22 was a 50 - seat jet , according to @entity65
@entity1 : the unmanned aircraft looked like a *miniature* @entity78 jet , pilot said
@entity1 : a jetliner 's pilot reported a near collision with a drone over @entity45
drones getting sucked into jet engines could be " catastrophic , " he adds
