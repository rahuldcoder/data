@entity0 , @entity1 -- a brigade of @entity6 troops originally scheduled to be among the very last to leave @entity7 is being pulled out of the country months ahead of its planned departure , military officials said saturday			1
the announcement follows news this month that a deal to keep @entity6 troops in @entity7 past a december 31 , 2011 , deadline to withdraw was on shaky ground after @entity7 leadership said any remaining @entity6 forces would not be granted immunity from @entity7 prosecution			1
secretary of defense @entity21 and other top brass have repeatedly said any deal to keep @entity6 troops in @entity7 beyond the withdrawal deadline must require a guarantee of legal protection for @entity6 soldiers			1
the @entity28 , @entity29 , based at @entity30 , deployed to @entity7 in august to replace two withdrawing brigades			0
the troops were sent with the understanding they would be among the last to leave the country and were told to expect up to a 12 - month deployment , though it was n't clear how long they would stay in @entity7			1
but brigade officials informed hundreds of military families gathered saturday at its headquarters that their troops would begin returning home within weeks			0
when family members inquired why soldiers were returning early , they were told by a military official : " basically , what 's happened ... is that the @entity6 and @entity7 have not come to an agreement , " according to a @entity2 reporter who attended the meeting			1
additionally , the brigade official told families : " we were over there for a couple of missions			2
" a @entity6 military official in @entity7 , speaking on condition of anonymity , confirmed to @entity2 saturday the early withdrawal of this brigade , citing a number of possible reasons , including the lack of a deal on the legal immunity issue and the fact that the @entity68 is " standing up " its operations faster than expected			1
when the @entity6 and @entity7 agreed in 2008 to a withdrawal deadline , the two countries also signed off on a @entity72 that calls for a long - term bilateral relationship			1
as part of that agreement , the @entity68 is deploying thousands of workers to @entity7 to take over where military officials leave off in their dealings with the @entity7 government			2
@entity6 officials in @entity82 on saturday declined to comment on reports that troops were being withdrawn ahead of schedule or because of a breakdown in negotiations , except to say the @entity6 is committed to withdrawing all troops by the december 31 deadline			2
" at the same time we 're building a comprehensive partnership with @entity7 under the @entity72 including a robust security relationship , and discussions with the @entity7 about the nature of that relationship are ongoing , " said @entity90 of the @entity91			0
@entity98 spokesman @entity97 also dismissed reports of a breakdown in talks with @entity7 , saying " suggestions that a final decision has been reached about our training relationship with the @entity7 government are wrong			1
" officials at @entity30 said the brigade 's return is in line with the @entity6 planned departure			0
" in the process , we are bringing troops back home to meet the december 31st agreed - upon deadline , " said lt. col. @entity111 , a public affairs officer for the @entity29			0
when asked about the legal immunity issue , major gen. @entity117 , commander at @entity30 , said , " we 're going to do what 's right by our soldiers			2
" " we should n't see @entity6 soldiers in @entity7 courts on trumped - up charges , " he said			2
his comments echo recent statements by @entity21 and @entity127 chief of staff @entity126			0
@entity21 said last week that negotiations over the legal immunity issue are ongoing between @entity7 's political leadership , @entity6 ambassador @entity131 and gen. @entity132 , commander of @entity6 forces in @entity7			1
the meetings include discussions about the rights of @entity6 troops and what will be required in order for those troops to assist @entity7 forces in the future , according to @entity21			1
" if you 're going to play a large role in dealing with another country where it requires , as i said , a large group of troops to be on the ground and to be dealing with that country , i want to make damn sure that you 're protected , " @entity21 told sailors last friday during a visit to @entity145 , @entity146 , home of the @entity147			0
@entity6 officials have been pressuring @entity7 's leadership for months for an answer to whether it would request a troop extension , with former @entity160 adm. @entity161 saying over the summer that the @entity6 needed a a decision by august			2
the negotiations have been strained following @entity165 ' release of a diplomatic cable that alleged @entity7 civilians , including children , were killed in a 2006 raid by @entity6 troops rather than in an airstrike as initially reported by the @entity6 military			1
the @entity98 dismissed the cable from @entity174 investigator @entity173 to @entity6 officials , saying it had investigated the claims and found there was no merit			2
shortly after the @entity165 cable gained attention in news reports in september by @entity182 , @entity7 prime minister @entity178 ordered an investigation into the deaths outside of @entity185			0
@entity6 officials have long said they believe @entity7 may need help with training , counterterrorism , air defense , command and control and intelligence operations			0
any @entity6 troops remaining to do those jobs might also need additional security forces			1
the prospect of @entity6 troops staying beyond the end of the year sits uncomfortably with many @entity7 , who have routinely questioned @entity6 motives following the 2003 @entity6 - led invasion that toppled @entity201			1
radical anti-american cleric @entity202 , whose @entity204 political party is closely aligned with @entity178 , has vowed to escalate armed resistance if the @entity6 military does not leave as scheduled , a move that could destabilize the country should his militia repeat the bloody battles it waged against @entity6 and @entity7 forces during the height of violence			1
@entity126 said last month that there would be risks in leaving a large force of @entity6 troops in @entity7 , noting such a force could provoke new claims of @entity6 occupation and distract from efforts to develop the @entity7 military 's abilities			1
he would not comment directly on reports that the @entity226 administration had decided to leave between 3,000 and 5,000 troops , should they be requested by @entity7			0
@entity126 , who served as the top @entity6 commander in @entity7 , said that training of @entity7 security forces was not complete			0
" we need to probably be there to assist them at certain levels for a while , " he said last month in a question - and - answer session with journalists at the @entity98			0
as of last week , 41,000 @entity6 military personnel remained in the country , according to major gen. @entity239 , spokesman for @entity240			0
@entity239 said wednesday that " we are on track , and we will meet our requirement to redeploy the last remaining military personnel from 41,000 down to zero by the end of the year			0
" a brigade typically consists of between 3,000 and 5,000 soldiers			0
@entity2 's @entity247 and @entity248 contributed to this report .			0

the brigade was originally scheduled to be among the last to leave @entity7 at the end of 2011
the move comes amid talks on legal immunity for @entity6 troops after withdrawal deadline
" the @entity6 and @entity7 have not come to an agreement , " says one brigade official
a @entity98 spokesman says talks are still ongoing
