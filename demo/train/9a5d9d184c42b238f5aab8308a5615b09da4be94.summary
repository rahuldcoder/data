-- the arraignment of @entity2 and four others charged as terrorists in @entity5 , @entity6 , over the weekend was widely described by the media as a " circus			1
" while the antics of these @entity12 terrorists were certainly colorful , i would like to take a moment to focus on the performance of an entirely different group , the journalists who covered the proceedings			0
while most reporters have been careful to write that those who were arraigned are " alleged " to have committed terrorism ( an allegation @entity2 has previously gleefully accepted ) , they are less careful when discussing the treatment these top terrorists received at the hands of the @entity25			1
@entity2 , four others charged in 9/11 attacks as i detail in my new book : " @entity30 , how aggressive @entity36 , " there are many myths surrounding the detention of a relatively small number of top terrorists at @entity25 - run " black sites " from 2002 until they were sent to @entity5 in 2006			1
the biggest myth is that the detainees were " tortured			1
" some of the stories coming out of @entity40 this past weekend simply state that as a fact			0
there is no " allegedly " attached to the allegation in these stories			0
about 30 out of the 100 or so detainees that the @entity25 held were subjected to some harsh treatment			1
but the @entity48 in the @entity49 assured us in writing that the treatment was specifically not torture			0
many of the techniques were essentially bluffs -- designed to get the attention of a detainee and perhaps scare him -- but to cause no physical harm			1
some of the stories this weekend talked of " years " of abusive treatment these detainees endured			2
in fact , the enhanced interrogation techniques ( @entity64 ) that @entity25 used were applied at most for only 30 days			1
on average , it was much less			0
@entity67 , the first detainee subjected to @entity64 , received them for less than three weeks			0
@entity2 's period of harsh -- but legal and necessary -- treatment was even less			1
the public impression , aided and abetted by the media , is that the practice of waterboarding was rampant			2
in fact , only three detainees : @entity2 , @entity67 and one other were ever waterboarded , the last one more than nine years ago			2
many of the stories this weekend repeated the assertion that @entity2 was waterboarded 183 times			0
but 183 is a count of the number of pours of water from a plastic water bottle			0
@entity2 told the @entity84 in 2007 that he had been waterboarded five times			0
if his story has now changed , it is only to match the media narrative			2
some will say it does n't matter how many times @entity2 was waterboarded -- the practice is brutal and must never be used			0
what goes unacknowledged is that in addition to the three terrorists , the @entity92 has waterboarded tens of thousands of @entity92 military personnel			0
if the practice is torture for the @entity12 operative who masterminded the killing of three thousand @entity92 , why were n't there court - martials in the cases of those thousands of servicemen similarly treated as part of their training ? there is no doubt that the detainees will try to use the legal proceedings as a soapbox to spout their contempt for @entity92 -- a contempt already indelibly displayed by such acts as ordering passenger jets to fly into iconic buildings or , in the case of @entity2 , personally beheading @entity117 reporter @entity116			1
in my book , i detail the critical information we obtained from @entity12 terrorists after they became compliant following a short period of enhanced interrogation			0
i have no doubt that that interrogation was legal , necessary and saved lives			1
it is good that these terrorists are now facing justice , but in the reporting of the case , it would be helpful if the media did n't help them with their propaganda mission by unquestioningly repeating false information about their detention			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity140			1

former @entity25 *official* @entity140 : it 's a myth that detainees were tortured
he says the *methods* used were legal and saved lives
@entity140 : media *exaggerated* the *degree* to which harsh techniques were used
