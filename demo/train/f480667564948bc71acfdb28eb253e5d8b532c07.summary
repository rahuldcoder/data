@entity0 -- the @entity4 will support @entity6 security efforts with $ 1 billion in loans for the next two years , @entity3 state media reported wednesday			1
that money will be in addition to $ 200 million the bank already has provided to different countries for fighting organized crime , the state - run @entity8 reported , citing the bank 's vice president for @entity16 and the @entity17			1
bank officials are among the international leaders gathered in @entity0 for a two - day regional security conference			2
" in meetings of this kind i see regional leadership , international solidarity , institutional commitment and unprecedented unity among the different national and international actors , and above all , consensus , " @entity4 vice president @entity29 said , according to the news agency			2
earlier wednesday , @entity33 secretary of state @entity32 said the @entity33 would increase the security aid it provides to @entity6 this year to help combat a wave of violence sweeping the region			1
additional @entity33 funding will go toward special police units , a regional crime observatory and support to train judges and prosecutors , @entity38 told leaders gathered at a regional security conference in @entity0			1
" you have identified your priorities			0
you have set your strategy			0
and we will respond with almost $ 300 million this year , backed up by an action plan that is focused on high - impact investments to help you build new capabilities and create the reforms you need from within , " @entity38 said			1
president @entity57 pledged more than $ 200 million when he visited @entity58 earlier this year , she said			1
the source of the funding was not immediately clear			0
on monday , assistant secretary of state @entity61 told reporters @entity38 may announce " repackaging " some assistance			2
@entity38 said the @entity33 has " shared responsibility " for violence in the region			1
" we know the demand for drugs rests largely in my own country , " she said			0
but she stressed that @entity6 countries must lead the fight against corruption and organized crime			1
" we will all be your ready partners , but we want and need to follow your lead , " she said			0
several @entity16 leaders at the meeting said the @entity33 must play a key role combating violence in the region			1
@entity3 president @entity82 said his country was reaching the limit of its ability to fight cartels			2
" eight killed per ton passing through @entity0 is a lot of blood			0
if you pass through @entity92 there are 20 murders and if we add it up , a ton of cocaine has too high a human cost			0
we must reduce consumption and control arms , " @entity82 said			0
@entity102 president @entity101 , who has repeatedly said @entity33 weapons and drug demand are fueling his country 's drug war , said more must be done			1
" if the sale of cocaine is a market of $ 35 billion in the @entity33 , according to that calculation , a good part of these billions of dollars must be used to feed the criminal organizations here , " @entity101 said			1
" the international aid should be at least equivalent to the flow of money in dollars that the criminals receive here to organize and to kill			0
" the conference is scheduled to continue thursday , when leaders are expected to hash out a more detailed regional plan			0
the meeting comes a week after @entity3 authorities announced a monthlong extension of the " state of siege " in the northern border province of @entity127 -- a move that increases military control to crack down on organized crime in the area			1
@entity82 declared the emergency measure in may after investigators found the bodies of 27 dismembered and decapitated workers on a farm in @entity127			0
authorities have said members of @entity102 's @entity139 drug cartel were responsible			2
the slayings provided brutal evidence of what analysts say is a dramatic spike in violence across the region as @entity102 drug cartels expand their reach			1
" as you look at the pressure placed on @entity102 cartels from the @entity33 side of the border , you 're going to see more and more of a southbound exodus , " said @entity149 , vice president of the @entity151 global intelligence agency			1
social and political conditions in @entity6 provide a fertile recruiting ground for cartels , said @entity161 , founding director of @entity162 , an online information network focused on @entity16			2
high unemployment and few jobs mean many are forced to turn to criminal activities to make ends meet , he said			0
" ultimately , what it comes down to is money			0
in @entity102 , the stakes are bigger , the pots of money are bigger , " he said			2
money also has allowed @entity102 organizations to wield significant influence with political leaders in @entity6 countries , many of which already had a longstanding history of institutional corruption , he said			1
" instead of bending over backwards , you get them to do somersaults , " @entity161 said			0
but despite the significant security problems the region faces , @entity149 said this week 's conference is a positive sign that leaders may step up efforts to stop violence			2
" discussion and dialogue is better than doing nothing , so the more exchanges you have along these lines , certainly the better off you are , " he said			0
@entity199 , journalist @entity200 and @entity1 's @entity201 contributed to this report .			0
