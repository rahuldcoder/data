-- in a hearing tuesday outside of the jury 's presence , attorneys in the @entity3 trial argued about whether jurors should see the defense 's 3d re-creation of the altercation between the neighborhood watch captain and @entity12			1
the defense also wants jurors to hear about @entity12 's text messages , which reportedly show he had been in fights and was trying to purchase a gun			1
the judge recessed court right before 10 p.m. et , saying she would wait until wednesday morning to make decisions on both of these issues			0
defense attorney @entity22 vented his frustration as the judge left the bench , saying he was having trouble keeping up with the long hours and fast - paced schedule of the trial			1
" i 'm not physically able to keep up this pace much longer , " @entity22 said			0
" it 's 10 o'clock at night			0
we 've had full days every day , weekends , depositions at night			0
" animator @entity33 said he uses crime scene evidence and the same motion capture technology used in movies like " @entity38 " to design his digital re-creations of alleged crimes			0
the defense said @entity33 's computer animation would help the jury understand how the confrontation between @entity12 and @entity3 unfolded			1
the prosecution argued the animated re-enactment makes assumptions , and it 's not based on evidence in the case			0
" to have an animation that goes back to the jury room that they can play over and over again ... gives a certain weight to something that this court is not particularly certain comports with the evidence presented at the trial , " said judge @entity50			2
@entity60 said she wanted to read the case law and wait until wednesday before making her ruling on the animation 's admissibility			2
the hearing , which went so late that the courtroom lights set on an automatic timer went out , continued tuesday evening after testimony had wrapped for the day			2
the defense even had to ask the judge to extend @entity3 's curfew , which is set for 10 p.m. et. @entity3 's defense team told @entity60 that it plans to rest its case sometime on wednesday			1
earlier on tuesday , a forensic pathologist testified for the defense , describing @entity12 's traumatic last moments alive as he bled to death in the grass after being shot at close range			1
" if he was involved in a struggle , you expect his heart to be going , beating -- especially after he had been shot -- more than a 100 times a minute , " said dr. @entity81 , adding that the way @entity12 died supports @entity3 's version of the shooting			1
" you are losing 1,500 cc 's ( cubic centimeters ) in a minute			0
that 's about a quarter of his blood supply			0
in a second minute , if you can assume the same rate			0
actually the heart would probably be beating faster for the second minute			0
he is going to lose another 1,500			0
well that means he has lost more than 50 % of his blood supply			0
" @entity3 appeared to be paying close attention during the testimony			2
@entity99 , the victim 's father , was in attendance but did n't show much emotion as he heard the details of how his son may have died			0
@entity12 's mother , @entity105 , was not in attendance			1
get the latest updates at @entity109 's live blog @entity81 said that given that the entry point of the bullet was a " contact wound " -- meaning at close range -- @entity12 never had a chance			2
" in this case you have a through - and - through hole of the right ventricle , and then you have at least one hole if not two into the right lung			2
so you are losing blood , and every time the heart contracts , it pumps blood out the two holes in the ventricle and at least one hole in the lung			2
" @entity81 also said @entity12 's gunshot wound indicates the gun was up against the teen 's clothing , about 2 to 4 inches away from the skin			1
he also said the weight of the canned drink in @entity12 's hoodie pocket may have been pulling his clothing away from his body by a few inches if @entity12 was on top of @entity3 , as the former neighborhood watch volunteer has claimed			1
in any event , " he is going to be dead between one and three minutes after being shot , " said @entity81			0
@entity12 , 17 , had been walking through the @entity143 -- the gated community in @entity145 , @entity146 , where @entity3 lived -- on february 26 , 2012 , when the two got into a physical altercation			1
@entity3 told the police he shot @entity12 in self - defense while holding the gun in his right hand at point - blank range			1
he said the teenager was on top of him at the time			0
@entity81 said the medical evidence is consistent with how @entity3 has described shooting the teenager			2
opinion : @entity3 trial - it 's about race @entity81 explained to the jury tuesday that @entity12 may have lost consciousness between 10 and 15 seconds after being shot and may have been able to talk or make voluntary movement during those last seconds			1
@entity3 has said that @entity12 said , " you got me , " after being shot .			1
