-- @entity1 , glaring , resolute , combative , left hand on hip , stares straight off the page -- a moment , and an image , like no other			2
( how did the photographer , @entity7 , get that iconic pose from @entity1 , @entity10 's prime minister , in 1941 ? @entity1 told @entity7 that he had very little time for the session			1
@entity7 reached over and took @entity1 's cigar from him -- then , as @entity1 reacted , snapped the photo			2
) @entity16 , at her most beautiful in 1953 , leans back , wearing white slacks and a black sweater , and gazes off dreamily to her right			2
somehow , even though being photographed for a national magazine , she appears supremely relaxed and right at home			2
why ? she was at home -- she knew that the photographer , @entity24 , and the magazine , life , would do right by her , and she had invited them in			0
prisoners at the @entity32 concentration camp in 1945 , their faces haunted , their bodies gaunt , their eyes showing nothing and everything , look out from behind the wire fence that imprisons them , just before they are liberated			0
how did @entity39 happen to be there to shoot that photo ? gen. @entity42 wanted the world to see why his soldiers were fighting			0
@entity42 understood that @entity39 and her magazine -- life -- were the best way for the world to witness and understand			0
all these photos and hundreds more are in a book called " 75 years : @entity51			1
" it was published just before the holidays ; i bought copies for friends around the country , and all of them have told me the same thing : they are spending hours with it , looking for long minutes at individual photos , treasuring the talent of the photographers , many long dead			1
view the recently launched @entity67 blog it is the photographers that i keep thinking about as i have spent my own hours and days with the book			1
to be a life staff photographer meant that you were among the best in the world			0
professional news photographers , even the most highly regarded of them , find themselves in tenuous times today ; it is expensive to have them on staff and to send them places to do their work			1
there is always going to be someone with a camera around to snap a close - to - good - enough image and sell it inexpensively or give it away			1
so to linger over the photos in the @entity84 anniversary book -- it is a very large book , because @entity46 's pages were large by design , for maximum impact -- is to marvel at the commitment the magazine made , especially in the days before television , to do whatever was necessary to bring the world to its readers			1
and to spend time with those images is to honor the talent and courage of the photographers whose best work is on the level of fine art -- fine art produced as the deadline clock is ticking			1
they seemed always to be there , at the moments that mattered			0
@entity111 in @entity112 in 1966 as @entity114 sgt. @entity113 , grievously wounded , reaches for a comrade who is also hurt ; @entity116 virtually living with the first astronauts , capturing @entity118 , in 1961 , running toward the @entity120 rocket booster that will propel him toward space ; @entity122 at @entity124 's side in that @entity126 hotel kitchen in 1968 , somehow , in the anguished confusion , getting the shattering photograph of busboy @entity129 who is down on the floor with @entity124 , trying to comfort the dying senator			0
. @entity133 in 1948 with dr. @entity134 , the country doctor who was the subject of one of the most famous photo essays ever published , as @entity134 , on the edge of exhaustion , wearily holds a cup of coffee ; @entity149 in @entity150 in 1961 , paying tribute to the heartbreaking life of 12 - year - old @entity145 , a boy who is malnourished and ill but who must care for his brothers and sisters ; @entity24 in @entity151 on @entity152 in 1945 , with the impossible task of trying to sum up in a single shot the nation 's joy as the war ends , and doing so with that photo of photos : the sailor and the nurse			1
. life featured words , too , of course , but it was the photographers who were the stars			1
during my own tenure as @entity46 's columnist , my first assignment took me to rural @entity170 with the @entity171 , as the singers returned to their late father 's home			1
i was glad to be in the company of @entity176 and @entity171 , but the real thrill came from the days spent on the road with the great life photographer @entity179			0
i kept looking over at him			0
so this is how he works			0
i did n't want to miss or forget a moment of it			0
i should mention that @entity46 and @entity0 reside under the same corporate roof			1
but i fell in love with life long before there was such a thing as @entity0 ; life brought the world to my parents ' @entity192 home , and when the mailman delivered it each week , he was bringing us more than just a magazine			0
well , he was bringing us life			0
life observed with as much skill and guts and heart as those photographers could push themselves to produce			1
life , as a regularly scheduled magazine , is no more ; it continues as a series of single - topic issues and special books , and its photography is featured on its popular website			2
but the life that was read in @entity211 's homes each week , and then , later , each month , is gone			0
" i ca n't stop looking at that book , " @entity212 , one of the friends to whom i gave copies , told me on the phone from @entity126 the other night			2
@entity218 rounds third base in the @entity220 , the expression on his face the stuff of novels , and @entity116 freezes it in time and gives us the chills all these years later			2
join @entity230 on @entity231 and follow updates on @entity233 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			1
