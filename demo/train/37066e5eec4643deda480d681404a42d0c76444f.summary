@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's oil minister monday opened international bidding on six oil fields that could increase the country 's oil production by 1.5 million barrels per day			1
@entity1 flags flutter during the opening ceremony of a new oil refinery plant in the @entity13 holy city of @entity14			0
but the oil ministry continues to negotiate short - term no - bid contracts with several @entity18 and @entity19 oil companies , including @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , and @entity24 -- a step recently criticized by two @entity18 lawmakers			1
oil minister @entity27 announced monday that 35 international oil companies can bid on long - term contracts for redeveloping the six oil fields , as well as two natural gas fields			1
" it is a unique event and a significant feature in the new @entity1 that we declare the first bidding course for developing the @entity1 oil fields publicly and fully in a transparent way , " the minister said at monday 's news conference			1
it marks the first time in more than 35 years that @entity1 has allowed foreign oil companies to do business inside its borders			0
@entity27 said the fee - based contracts will not give the winning companies a share in the revenue from oil sales " because this wealth belong to @entity1 only and thus we will not allow anyone to share the @entity1 ' oil			2
" @entity1 has among the largest oil reserves in the world , with an estimated 115 billion barrels -- tying @entity55 for the no. 2 status behind @entity58 's 264 billion barrels , according to estimates from the @entity60			0
@entity1 's current oil production is 2.25 million barrels a day , according to the @entity60			1
that is close to its status before the @entity18 - led war that toppled @entity66 in 2003 , but below its levels prior to the first @entity68 in 1991			0
the six oil fields that will be open to development are in the @entity72 oil fields and the neighboring @entity73 fields in northern @entity1 , @entity27 said			2
they are @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , and three fields in the @entity80 oil fields -- @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			0
the two gas fields are @entity85 and @entity87 gas fields in western @entity1			0
the fields have already been explored and are producing oil and gas , but the equipment is old and outdated , @entity27 said			0
he hopes that the new infrastructure provided by the international oil companies will mean " the production can be increased in less cost and less time			0
" @entity1 's oil minister said the ministry will invite the 35 qualified international companies --- which includes @entity24 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity23 -- to prepare their bids over the next two weeks			1
the contracts could go into effect by next year , but @entity27 said it will take several more years before oil production is increased			0
" we hope in 2013 through this first bidding course to increase production in these fields by 1.5 million barrels per day , in addition to our daily average production rate during the last five years , " he said			1
meanwhile , @entity1 hopes to wrap up its talks regarding short - term , no - bid contracts that would allow the @entity18 and @entity19 oil companies -- including @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , and @entity24 -- to service those oil fields as soon as possible			1
last week , sen. @entity116 , @entity118 - @entity117 , and sen. @entity119 , @entity120 , sent a letter to secretary of state @entity122 expressing concerns about the no - bid contracts that the government of @entity1 is negotiating with the @entity18 and @entity19 companies			1
the senators , who released the letter , said they are worried that unfair distribution of oil revenue could inflame the violence between the warring religious and political groups of @entity1			0
" we urge you to persuade the ( government of @entity1 ) to refrain from signing contracts with multinational oil companies until a hydrocarbon law is in effect in @entity1 , " read the letter from @entity116 and @entity119			2
" at this time , the ( government of @entity1 ) currently does not have in place a revenue - sharing law that could fairly allocate any revenue gained from @entity1 's lucrative hydrocarbon fields between the three major ethnic groups in @entity1 , " read the letter			1
" we fear that any such agreements signed by @entity1 's @entity146 without an equitable revenue - sharing agreement in place would simply add more fuel to @entity1 's civil war			2
" in their letter , the senators said that @entity1 's oil revenue during 2007 and 2008 will total $ 100 billion , " most of which will not be spent on reconstruction due to bureaucratic incompetence			2
" the oil ministry said monday that the negotiations over the no - bid " technical support agreements " are ongoing			0
under those short - term agreements the companies would be paid a fee for extracting the oil , but would not get a share of the revenue from oil sales			1
the companies that will be allowed to compete in the open bidding for long - term contracts , which would be under a similar revenue format , are :			0
