targeted assassinations or the capture of senior insurgent leaders in larger counterinsurgency operations can provide both positive and negative outcomes according to a classified @entity6 document posted by the anti-secrecy group @entity7 on thursday			1
the use of so - called high - value targeting , or @entity11 , programs are the subject of a document titled " @entity14 in @entity15 " and labeled as secret -- and not for the eyes of foreign nations -- dates back to july 2009 in the early days of the @entity20 administration			2
according to the document , the @entity6 assessed the results of such operations by either @entity25 government personnel or other countries during operations in @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and eight other countries			1
use of high - value targeting programs can have beneficial effects such as eroding insurgent effectiveness , weakening insurgent will , and fragmenting or splitting the insurgent group among others			2
however , the report cites the possibility of increasing the level of support for insurgent groups , radicalizing an insurgent group 's remaining leaders and creating a vacuum for additional radical groups to enter as potential adverse effects for such operations			2
a @entity6 spokesperson told @entity51 the agency does not comment on the authenticity or content of purported stolen intelligence documents			1
several case studies from various high - value targeting operations spanning 50 years formed the basis of the report			0
efforts to target senior members of the @entity28 @entity63 since 2001 were constrained by the limited reach of the central government beyond @entity66 , along with the @entity63 's " high overall ability to replace lost leaders " illustrate the limits of high - value targeting operations according to clandestine and @entity25 military reporting that formed the basis of that research			0
but the report cites the @entity79 government 's use of high - value targeting operations against the @entity83 guerilla movement , and the overall psychological impact produced by the strikes on the broader population boosted the " government 's legitimacy " and reduced morale within the @entity83 over time			0
and the continued use of targeting senior @entity92 leaders served to weaken @entity94 's control of his organization before his death at the hands of @entity98 in 2011			0
@entity94 's efforts to avoid detection " including his reliance on low - technology communications , his reluctance to meet with subordinates and his contentment with leading from a sequestered distance via infrequent contact , " affected his ability to lead the organization according to the report			0
the document purports to provide both lessons and a framework for evaluating high - value targeting operations for @entity25 policy makers and military leaders involved in their ultimate authorization			0
multiple sources of information formed the basis for the @entity6 's findings according to the document			1
" most of our source information relies on clandestine and defense attache reporting , discussions with @entity11 practitioners , a @entity6 - sponsored study on @entity11 operations in counterinsurgencies and our review of current and historical case documents , " the report says .			1
