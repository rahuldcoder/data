stretching across the heart of @entity4 , @entity2 's spider - web of highways ferries tons of goods on their journey across the continent and beyond			0
the country is a strategic transport gateway between east and west , with four million trucks racing down its roads day and night , helping to keep its industrial economy ticking			2
but with road transport accounting for about one - fifth of the @entity18 's total emissions of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas , there is a pressing need to find cleaner ways of hauling cargo			2
enter @entity24 -- a bold new idea to adapt existing technology behind tram lines to electrify trucks on the highway			1
the project is currently taking shape in the workshops of @entity2 electrical giant @entity33 , and scientists hope it will eventually enable trucks to drive almost emission free			1
" right now we only have electro mobility for cars , and with this project we want to develop the technology to drive trucks electrically , " says @entity36 , the technical project manager of the initiative			1
adapting systems the technology is being tested at a former @entity43 airbase near @entity44 , and centers on hybrid trucks			1
these are fed electricity from powerlines , which are dotted along the road , through a so - called pantograph			2
the device , which is more commonly used for trams , is mounted on the truck 's roof , and plays a crucial part in the operation			0
" it needs to work even if you have to brake quickly or if you suddenly have to leave the lane			0
those are all the small steps , but they are necessary to make it work , " says @entity36			2
trucks are not limited to one lane only -- they can overtake one another by detaching from the power lines when the driver blinks , and then can return to position by lifting the pantograph back up to the cables when the process is complete			1
@entity72 says that this automation could be applied beyond the highways			0
" whenever you have trucks driving the same route shuttling goods back and forth all day , that is where we want to use this technology			1
" so , also in logistic centers in ports and mining applications as well , " adds @entity72			0
going green the @entity88 estimates that by 2050 freight transport in the @entity18 will increase by 80 % , and experts stress that moving cargo has to become more environmentally - friendly			0
" if we want to achieve our climate emission targets we have to think about alternative drive trains , hybridization , but also of course substitutes , so we would try to shift a lot more towards trains , " says @entity92 , of the @entity93			0
with that in mind , the @entity102 project seeks to combine the efficiency of rail transport with the flexibility of trucks			1
trials are set to move from the test area near @entity44 to a public road in the @entity112 next year , and in time , engineers hope this technology could amp the green credentials of logistics around the world			1

@entity102 project aims to electrify trucks on the highway
it uses existing tram lines technology to make trucks almost emission free
the system is being tested near @entity44 , but set to move to a public road in the @entity112 next year
