-- @entity1 and @entity2 are both young @entity4 photographers taking their first steps in promising artistic careers			1
their work , however , could hardly be more different			1
while @entity9 focuses on the gritty reality of life in urban @entity12 , @entity1 's images are whimsical and surreal , created from her imagination			1
they are both among the latest emerging artists to be featured in the @entity16 run by @entity17 in @entity18			1
the auction , held on tuesday ( may 15 ) , featured 75 lots from 63 emerging and established @entity22 artists , 10 of them aged 30 or under			1
@entity17 has been running @entity23 since 2008 , aimed at supporting emerging artists and opening the art market to new collectors			1
almost all the works had estimates well below $ 10,000 , with most in the region of $ 2,000 to $ 3,000			1
" the art market here is quite young and people are interested in buying art , but intimidated by the gallery scene and auctions , " said @entity30 , @entity17 's auctioneer			1
" we wanted to start something with a relaxed atmosphere , lower estimates and young emerging artists			1
" see also : auctions celebrate art of @entity46 world the recipe has been a success and @entity17 has just run its 13th @entity16 ' auction			1
the latest raised a total of $ 550,000			1
@entity30 believes @entity22 art could be on the verge of an explosion similar to that seen in the @entity56 and @entity57 art markets in recent years			1
" there 's great art in this region and internationally it 's undervalued , " he said			1
" there has been a steady increase in prices and this is just the beginning			1
politically there 's so much going on and that 's reflected by artists			1
" here we feature 10 emerging @entity22 artists aged 30 or under from the @entity69 who could be names to watch out for in the future			1
@entity1 , @entity4 , born 1987 @entity1 , 24 , studied economics at university and only began photography as a hobby in 2009			1
" over time the hobby grew and grew and became an obsession , " she said			1
" i promoted my work through social media and gradually started to gain more followers and feedback and eventually freelance projects			2
" she held her first exhibition collective two years ago and is part of @entity17 's incubator program			1
@entity1 's photography consists of surreal compositions she creates from her imagination , rather than an attempt to capture reality			2
" i like to create worlds of my own			2
a lot of work goes into setting up the scene , " said @entity1 , who once dragged a bed into the sea for a photograph			2
for now , she still works full time as an economic researcher alongside her photography			2
@entity2 , @entity4 , born 1989 @entity9 , 22 , captures the gritty reality of urban @entity12 in her photography , aiming to tackle social problems			2
she had just graduated in graphic design from the @entity103 last year when she got her break entering a competition organized by @entity17			1
her entry was a series of photographs of an abandoned school building			2
" photography is a means , not an end , " said @entity9			2
" the ideas i like to get across do not get much attention from artists and people in general			1
" other subjects she has tackled include the destruction of @entity12 's architectural heritage , and street vendors and their makeshift shelters			2
" there 's no such thing as the right time to start out as an artist , it takes a lot of determination , " said @entity9			2
" but since i 've started i 've discovered a lot of different artists from this region			1
there 's a very rich art scene			2
