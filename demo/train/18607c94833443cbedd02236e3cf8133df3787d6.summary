backgammon other than chess -- the history of which is well - covered elsewhere -- the most enduring table game of the last few centuries is backgammon , also known as " tables " early in its history			1
backgammon itself is a descendant , at least in spirit if not in direct lineage , of the games of @entity17 and @entity18			1
the missing link may be the @entity21 game @entity22 or @entity23 , with rules nearly identical to backgammon 's and appearances in @entity28 and @entity29 literature between 300 and 850 a.d. ; when the @entity30 conquered @entity31 in the 6th century , the game spread throughout the @entity34 world , moving up the @entity35 and into @entity36 as well as @entity37 , from which it headed further into @entity39			1
@entity0 : 5,000 years of boardgames ( @entity41 ) @entity42 , author of the misnamed chess in @entity44 ( which includes histories of many table games beyond chess ) , argues for @entity22 as the connection between tables / backgammon and the table games of antiquity , while @entity53 identifies its entry into @entity39 as @entity55 , later @entity56 , by way of the @entity58 and then @entity59			1
@entity56 first appears in literature through an epigram written by the @entity62 , who lamented a particularly unfortunate throw of the dice in verse that was reproduced several decades later by the @entity59 poet @entity66			0
an early variant of @entity55 , called @entity68 ( derived from the game tric - trac , where the goal was achieving certain scores or positions rather than bearing off all of one 's pieces ) , even earns mention in @entity78 's " @entity77 " , as @entity79 says to @entity80 in response to the latter 's plea for @entity79 to talk to @entity80 ' nunnery - bound sister : " i pray she may ; as well for the encouragement of the like , which else would stand under grievous imposition , as for the enjoying of thy life , who i would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick - tack			1
" the term " backgammon " itself first appears in 1645 , spelled " baggammon , " in a letter that also referred to @entity96 , a simpler predecessor that did n't include doubles or the levels of winning found in the modern game			1

@entity104 popular today under the trademarked name @entity104 , the game previously called @entity104 predates the @entity104 brand name by more than a half - century , but the name @entity104 fell into the public domain several decades after its invention and publication			1
the inventor of @entity104 remains in dispute ; the original patent went to @entity116 @entity115 in 1888 , but he was later accused of theft by @entity118 , whose annexation game purportedly dated to 1870			1
@entity104 differs from @entity104 only in name , in starting placement ( in @entity104 the first four pieces go in the center , but not necessarily in the familiar diagonal pattern ) , and in origin myth , as @entity104 was " invented " in @entity126 in the 1960s by @entity128			0
risk risk was first published in @entity130 in 1957 as @entity131 , or " @entity137 , " the name under which @entity133 first published it in the @entity136			1
the game was invented by @entity139 - and @entity141 - winning film director @entity140 , who was also the author of the children 's book " the @entity146 , " adapted from his @entity139 - winning short film of that name			1
game historian @entity147 has written that the choice of the risk name reflected the first initials of the four grandchildren of the company salesman who suggested the name , although the story seems to be apocryphal			1

diplomacy diplomacy , tabbed by one gamer friend of mine as " risk for grown - ups , " was developed by @entity164 in the early 1950s but was not published until 1959 , when @entity164 decided to print it himself after existing game houses were n't interested			1
a favorite of @entity168 , @entity169 , and @entity170 , the game has sold over 300,000 copies since its 1960 publication by @entity174 , and the game has endured the vicissitudes of the game - publishing industry , going to @entity178 , @entity179 , and now @entity180			2
@entity164 , a @entity181 graduate , drifted through law school and a few other jobs before settling on a career as a postal worker			0
he never published another game			2
@entity0 : @entity187 : the rise of ' @entity189 ' part of the brilliance of @entity192 is that it involves no luck whatsoever			0
seven players ( no more , no fewer ) represent seven great powers in @entity39 at 1900			0
they must form and break alliances with each other to try to be the one player left at the end who controls the majority of the 34 spaces on the map of the continent			0
the game relies entirely on negotiations and player strategy , with numerous strategy guides abounding online , including an entire @entity209 article on a popular opening sequence for @entity211 called the @entity213 opening			2
one of a handful of games ( with risk ) in both the @entity219 and @entity215 , diplomacy is an excellent choice if you enjoy knife fights with your friends and holding grudges that last well beyond the final move			2

checkers the game known today as checkers or draughts likely traces back to @entity233 , a game that first appears in a 1283 treatise by @entity236 , summarizing the state of dice , table , and board games in that era			1
the " de doze " variety of @entity233 , where each player began with twelve pieces , was played on a five - by - five grid , with only the central space unoccupied at the opening			1
a player moves by sliding any piece horizontally , vertically , or diagonally to an adjacent , vacant space , or by jumping over an opponent 's piece to a vacant space , thereby capturing the piece he jumped			2
the game could , and arguably should , end in a draw , as there is no luck involved and the second player can always simply counter the first 's moves			1
@entity233 was found throughout southwestern @entity39 from @entity262 to @entity130 to @entity263			1
@entity233 itself was related to the games known collectively as " merels , " from the @entity267 merellus meaning a token or game piece			1
@entity53 asserts that merels were viewed on par with chess and tables by the aristocracy of the @entity274 , where the wealthy could afford the specially - designed boards required for these games , often owning two - sided boards to allow for the play of two of the three games			2
merels were two - player games where each player is trying to line up three of his pieces in a row , a style of game largely fallen into disuse but recognizable in @entity287 ( also known as " noughts and crosses " in the @entity290 ) and the 1970s staple @entity291			2
@entity293 in 1938 , architect @entity294 revised his own word - tile game , @entity296 , calling the new version @entity297 and -- stop me if you 've heard this before -- found his idea rejected by the game - publishing establishment			2
( among those rejecting it : @entity306 , @entity133 , and @entity307			0
) when early demand proved more than he could handle while holding down a full - time government job and some freelance work as an architect , @entity294 sought a publisher , eventually selling the rights to @entity315 , executive director of the president 's @entity316 , in exchange for a royalty on future game sales ; @entity315 tweaked the board , retitled the game @entity293 , and lost money for three years before his fortunes turned			1
for reasons lost to history , sales started to increase radically in the summer of 1952 , led by a large order from @entity329 's			2
from sales of just 1632 units in 1950 -- a drop of about 33 percent from 1949 -- @entity293 moved just under 3.8 million copies in 1954 , by which point @entity315 had licensed the game to @entity336			2
if you 're interested in @entity293 , i highly recommend @entity340 ' entertaining history of both the game and his own obsessive efforts in the world of competitive @entity293 players , @entity345			2

hex one entire class of games that has largely disappeared since its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s is connection games -- largely abstract games where players would try to capture areas or block opponents ' paths by connecting disparate points on a board of lines or pegs			0
the best - known example is @entity347 , invented independently in the 1940s by two mathematicians : @entity365 of @entity366 , and @entity367 of the @entity136 and " @entity369 " fame			0
( @entity53 actually gets this one wrong , referring to @entity365 as " a @entity372 student , " conflating the two men			0
) first commercialized in 1952 by @entity133 , who gave it the name " @entity347 , " the underlying game is played on a board of variable size but equal length and width where the game spaces are hexagonal , thus each bordering six adjacent spaces			0
the players play at perpendicular angles to each other , and each player 's goal is to connect from his side to the opposite side			0
@entity367 proved that the game is a determined game : there can be no tie or draw , as the only conclusion is when one player completes a path between two opposite sides of the board			0
@entity400 @entity400 , now out of print , was invented by @entity402 in 1962 and published by @entity178 as part of its " bookshelf games " series a decade later			0
@entity400 's board is a 24 Ã— 24 grid of holes , where each player places pegs to connect to his pegs already on the board			0
the only permitted placement mimics that of a chess player 's knight -- two holes in one direction , then a 90 - degree turn and shift of one more hole			1
the goal of @entity400 , as in @entity347 , is to connect from one side to the other , but in @entity400 the chain would be a series of pegs and connectors			0
@entity400 , unlike @entity347 , is in @entity219 's @entity429 , but is not commercially available , as the rights went to @entity180 when the company purchased legendary board game publisher @entity179			1
