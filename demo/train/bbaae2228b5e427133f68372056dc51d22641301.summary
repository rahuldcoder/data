coal is the new gold in @entity2 -- it 's also one of the worst polluters on the planet			1
@entity2 is the world 's fourth largest coal exporter with over 40 billion tons of the fossil fuel in reserves , according to the government			1
while the @entity12 reported sales of some $ 10 billion last year			1
but the of host of the @entity15 , currently taking place in @entity17 , is under increasing pressure to curb its addiction to coal -- the world 's most notorious contributor to the greenhouse gases blamed for contributing to climate change			1
from @entity2 to @entity26 , @entity27 to @entity28 , coal is the bedrock on which most world economies have been built			1
reducing its use , many countries argue , will reduce productivity and growth			2
" if today we say no to coal , that means we have to switch off all our power plants in @entity2 , " said @entity36 , @entity2 's minister of energy			1
" what is going to happen to our country ? we need to keep the lights on			0
we need to grow the economy and create jobs			0
as we speak 25 % of our people are unemployed			0
" developed countries have pledged to contribute $ 100 billion towards a @entity48 that would subsidize efforts by developing nations to reduce their carbon emissions			1
but with the economies of developed countries under strain many fear these funds will never materialize			0
complicating matters even more is the argument around whether the world 's second biggest economy , @entity28 , should be entitled to such a subsidy			1
in the meantime , with more power stations either being built or planned , @entity2 's coal mining industry is likely to continue to grow			1
it is also creating opportunities for young entrepreneurs like @entity66			0
" people want coal in big numbers , " the mining logistics businessman said			2
" we can not satisfy the export market as it is			0
" and locally the hospitals use coal , manufacturers use coal , even the prisons			2
everywhere there is demand for coal			2
" @entity27 has been @entity2 's main coal export market , but orders from @entity82 and @entity28 have rapidly grown in recent years			1
still , it is domestic demand that drives the industry : over 90 % of @entity2 's electricity , produced by power utility @entity87 , is generated from coal			1
the government - controlled company has some of the biggest power plants in the world and is busy building more -- a move that has attracted the attention of international environmentalists @entity97 , who recently staged a demonstration at a power plant under construction in the @entity102 province			1
" this country has been mining coal since the 1860 , " said @entity103 of @entity97			2
" it has formed the backbone of the economy and it 's what @entity87 knows			2
" so what do you do when you are in an electricity crisis ? you invest in what you know			0
even though the government is talking nicely about climate change we are not seeing the action and we are not seeing the urgency			0
" @entity28 and the @entity26 are undoubtedly the world 's worst air polluters , but @entity2 leads in @entity2 -- and activists say it should be leading in clean energy as well			1
" less than 1 % of this country 's energy is green which is a sorry tale			2
we are seeing more significant action from countries like @entity131 in this regard , " said @entity127			0
at the last @entity137 climate change conference , @entity135 in @entity134 , president @entity133 committed to reducing 34 % of @entity2 's carbon emissions by 2020 and some progress is being made			1
several initiatives to create electricity from waste are already underway			0
@entity2 's biggest sugar producer , @entity144 , says with the right incentives from government it could invest in equipment that could see it produce 1.6 gigawatts per hour of power from sugar fiber called baggase -- power it could add to the national grid			1
@entity36 says the government will conclude discussions with the sugar industry soon and in the meantime it is investigating other alternatives			0
several wind and sun energy projects already have the government 's financial backing			2
" we have got a plan of one million solar geysers ( solar water heaters ) by 2014			0
one million solar geysers saves 3,000 megawatts			0
three thousand megawatts is a potential power plant , and we are saying being able to do that is an indication of our commitment , " she said			0
it 's a delicate balancing act -- one many developing countries continue to grapple with			0
alleviating poverty remains a primary focus whatever the means			0
some of @entity2 's major employers are also among the country 's top polluters			1
they 've warned that without alternative energy sources , the government 's ambitious carbon reduction targets will negatively impact on plans to grow the economy and create jobs			1
@entity36 says her department hopes to ultimately be able to provide big industries with reliable clean energy to meet their minimum demands			0
" we want to build 5,000 megawatts of solar power so that we can , in the next 10 years , prove to ourselves and to the world that solar and wind can be a base load , " she added			2
these are ambitious targets and promises that may go up in smoke if the world fails to reach consensus in @entity17 .			0
