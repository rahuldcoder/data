-- " about 20 " cases of a polio - like syndrome have been identified in @entity6 children over the past 18 months , a @entity1 researcher says			1
dr. @entity7 , a pediatric neurologist at @entity8 , has written a report about five of the early cases			1
in that report , which will be presented in april at the @entity14 's annual meeting , neurologists said they had identified five patients who developed paralysis in one or more of their limbs between august 2012 and july 2013			1
all five children had been vaccinated against the poliovirus			1
@entity20 did not seem to help the children regain their motor function			1
samples from two of those children tested positive for enterovirus 68 , a rare virus that has been linked to severe respiratory illness in the past			1
samples from the other three children were not collected or tested soon enough to yield conclusive results , said dr. @entity33 , a neurologist at the @entity34 , @entity35			1
" about 20 cases have been identified in the @entity40 so far , all in @entity6 , and all occurring in the past 18 months , " @entity7 said in an online posting monday on the hospital 's website			1
@entity41 is one of the children affected			2
her mother , @entity43 , told reporters monday night the family is speaking out to raise awareness of the condition			0
@entity49 experienced what doctors thought was asthma and spent four days in the hospital , her mother said			0
as the family was leaving a follow - up pediatrician visit , @entity49 reached for a toy out of the doctor 's " treasure box			0
" " i saw her left hand , mid-grasp , stop working , " her mother said			0
" we did not realize what we were in store for , " @entity43 said			0
@entity49 , who had received a polio vaccination , had spinal cord inflammation , and her left arm is permanently paralyzed			0
the paralysis surfaced at age 2 , according to @entity8			2
today , she is doing well , @entity43 said , but trying to tie her shoes or get dressed -- things she " would normally be learning , we 're going to have to find a new way of doing			0
" @entity33 and her colleagues are asking health care providers to be on the lookout for similar cases and send in samples from any patient exhibiting these symptoms			1
" we want to temper the concern because , at the moment , it does not appear to represent a major epidemic but only a very rare phenomenon , " @entity7 said			1
@entity7 and @entity33 spoke with reporters monday night , and @entity7 said that although they have found five cases , there are " preliminary reports of several more			2
" in the cases , he said , children experience a " sudden onset of flaccid weakness that can occur over the course of hours , " affecting one or more limbs			1
" the prognosis that we 've seen so far is not good , " he said			0
most of the children have not recovered use of the most severely affected limb , although some recovery has been seen in less - affected limbs			2
the condition is associated with " severe weakness , " @entity33 said			0
" it 's not just dropping a toy ; it 's more like not being able to move your arm at all			0
" polio - like illness found in five @entity6 children dr. @entity114 , chief of the @entity115 at the @entity116 , said the state is aware of the paralysis cases but believes the risk to families is low			1
" we are evaluating cases as they are reported to us , " @entity114 said in an e-mail to @entity2			2
" we have not found anything at this point that raises any public health concerns			2
" the department " is taking these reports very seriously , " @entity7 said			0
the phenomenon , he added , is not entirely new , as similar outbreaks have been seen across the world			2
the poliovirus has been eradicated in the @entity40 for more than 30 years			1
only three countries in the world are not yet free of the disease : @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 , according to the @entity139			0
why polio has n't gone away yet poliovirus is part of the @entity144 family , which also includes enteroviruses and rhinoviruses ( better known as the common cold )			2
there are more than 100 types of enterovirus that cause 10 million to 15 million infections in the @entity40 each year , according to the @entity152			1
most people who become infected with an enterovirus do not get sick or experience only mild symptoms , said dr. @entity156 , chief of the @entity157 and @entity158 at the @entity152			2
common symptoms include fever , runny nose , cough , skin rash and body aches			0
@entity165 is often the cause of " summer colds , " whose cases spike in july , august and september			2
children and teens are more likely to fall ill because they have not yet built up immunity to these common viruses			2
however , some types of enterovirus are more serious			2
these can cause hand , foot and mouth disease ; viral meningitis ; encephalitis ( inflammation of the brain ) ; an infection of the heart ; and paralysis in some patients			2
@entity165 68 was first identified in a @entity6 lab in 1962 after four children came down with a severe respiratory illness			1
between 1970 and 2005 , only 26 cases of enterovirus 68 in the @entity40 were reported to the @entity152			1
since 2000 , the government agency has kept a closer watch and has seen 47 cases , @entity156 said			0
outbreaks have occurred over the years in @entity195 and @entity196 , but it 's still one of the rarest types of enterovirus			0
more common -- and more concerning to health officials -- is enterovirus 71 , which was discovered by the same @entity6 lab in 1969 , @entity156 said			1
enterovirus 71 is usually associated with severe neurological issues , including aseptic meningitis , polio - like paralysis and encephalitis			1
@entity33 is not sure if the samples from this latest group of patients were tested for enterovirus 71			1
according to a @entity152 report , several outbreaks of paralysis caused by enterovirus 71 were seen in @entity196 in the 1960s and 1970s			1
in the late 1990s and early 2000s , fatal encephalitis was a big problem in @entity219 and @entity220			0
" ever since then , the virus has circulated in high levels in @entity195 , " @entity156 said			0
in recent years , the outbreaks have spread to @entity224 ; a cluster of cases near @entity227 drew media attention in 2013			0
between 1983 and 2005 , 270 cases of enterovirus 71 were reported in the @entity40			1
but none has resulted in a larger outbreak despite the infectious nature of the virus			0
" that 's the really odd thing , " @entity156 said			0
" we see cases from time to time in the @entity40			1
occasionally they 'll be severe			0
basically it 's identical to what 's circulating in @entity195 ... but it does n't cause the same big outbreak in disease			0
and we really do n't know why			0
" the @entity152 is aware of the small cluster of cases in @entity6 but is not actively involved in an investigation , a spokesman told @entity2			0
@entity33 and her colleagues do n't want to alarm anyone with their case report presentation ; they 're simply seeking help in finding the cause of these seemingly connected cases			1
parents need to know that vaccination is key to preventing polio from returning to the @entity40 , @entity114 said			1
while there is no vaccine to protect you from a non-polio enterovirus , washing your hands frequently and avoiding close contact with others who are sick can help .			0

neurologist : cases do n't seem to be " a major epidemic but only a very rare phenomenon "
some children tested positive for enterovirus 68 , a rare virus linked to respiratory illness
another type , enterovirus 71 , is more commonly linked to paralysis
both are uncommon in the @entity40 ; health officials say risk is low
