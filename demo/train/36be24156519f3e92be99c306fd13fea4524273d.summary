-- plenty of people who feel no inclination to schuss or slide or @entity4 are faithful fans of the @entity6			1
for them , we present this list of sites and activities at former @entity6 venues			1
you wo n't need skis or skates -- you do n't even have to feel the cold wind against your skin -- to show your appreciation for the athletes or to experience just a bit of what they must have felt when competing at the @entity6			1
@entity23 , @entity24 ( 1924 ) more than 10,000 paying spectators came to watch 11 women and 247 men compete in ice hockey , figure skating , speed skating , bobsleighing , curling , @entity32 ( cross-country ) skiing and ski jumping at @entity35 90 years ago			2
it was n't until after the event proved to be such a success that it became known as the " first " @entity6			1
although few reminders of those games remain , the @entity39 in @entity23 houses some mementos , and the @entity44 @entity43 commemorates the region 's @entity6 heritage with a stained glass window featuring skiers and a bobsleigh			1
and this charming alpine village near @entity51 -- the " roof of @entity53 " -- still offers a world - class winter experience to athletes and bar - hoppers alike			2
photos : remnants of glory in former @entity6 cities @entity61 , @entity62 ( 1928 and 1948 ) when 15 - year - old @entity65 figure skating sensation @entity64 performed her gold - medal - winning routine on the ice rink outside the @entity70 family 's @entity68 in 1928 , the location could n't have been more appropriate			1
in 1864 , hotelier @entity70 turned @entity61 into a winter vacation destination by convincing his summertime guests that they 'd enjoy the @entity73 just as much in winter			0
sportsman @entity74 supported construction of the natural ice @entity61 - @entity78 bobsleigh run			1
and @entity81 ' grandson , @entity80 , was a member of the executive committees that brought the 1928 games to @entity61			0
the @entity86 and @entity70 's @entity85 hotels are still @entity61 landmarks , as is the @entity61 - @entity78 bobsleigh run , which is open to guest riders when it 's not being used by olympians - in - training			1
@entity92 hotels report construction delays @entity94 , @entity95 ( 1932 and 1980 ) although @entity94 hosted the games in 1932 , it is most remembered for the @entity100 athletes ' performances at the @entity101 -- especially the @entity100 men 's ice hockey team 's " @entity104 " victory over the heavily favored @entity107 team followed by their gold - medal win over @entity109 and @entity111 's unprecedented five gold medals in speed skating			0
that historic speed - skating oval stands just outside the @entity114 , which houses a small museum and the hockey arena now dedicated to coach @entity117			0
the whole @entity119 and @entity120 area remains a top - level training ground for future @entity122 ; and if you 're feeling adventurous , the @entity123 lets you try out the track they still use today for their training			0
@entity92 2014 : @entity128 's numbers game @entity129 , @entity65 ( 1952 ) it sometimes seems as if the @entity6 were created to remind the world just how many outstanding winter athletes come from @entity65			1
( no country has won more medals in the @entity6			1
) so when you 're in @entity129 , it 's no surprise that the @entity139 ski jump is still the biggest thing in town			0
ski jumping has been part of the action here since 1892 , and the jump has been redeveloped more than a dozen times			0
the latest structure , which opened in 2010 , is made of steel and stretches nearly 97 meters ( 318 feet )			0
the ski simulator at the top of the hill is a virtual reality experience that will leave you breathless and more awestruck by ski - jumpers than ever			0
the arena next to the ski jump was used for cross-country skiing and biathlon competitions in 1952 , and might be again should @entity129 win its bid to host the @entity161			0
@entity162 and other natural oddities @entity164 , @entity165 ( 1964 and 1976 ) the @entity166 were a picture - perfect backdrop for @entity6 skiing competition in 1976 as @entity165 favorite @entity169 seemed to gobble up the terrain on his way to a gold medal in the men 's downhill and @entity177 's @entity176 took two golds and a silver in the women 's downhill and slalom events			1
you 'll want more than the 1 minute 45 seconds or so that @entity184 and @entity176 spent on the mountain			0
take your time to soak in the scenery on an evening lantern hike that takes you past the @entity6 ski slopes and ends with singing and beverages at a friendly inn			1
@entity192 , @entity193 ( 1972 ) the double lift takes just five minutes to carry you to the top of the @entity197 90 - meter ski jump hill where , in 1972 , 19 - year - old @entity198 became the first and only @entity201 man to win an @entity6 ski - jumping gold medal			1
( in 1972 , transport to the top took 20 minutes ; the trip down for @entity207 , less than 20 seconds			0
) the viewing lounge at 300 meters allows you to peer down at the city and at the ski jump starting line			0
at the @entity213 , simulators in the " @entity212 " replicate the ski jump experience			0
@entity215 , @entity216 ( 1988 ) the @entity6 spirit has never left @entity215 , where @entity218 won a gold medal in figure skating for @entity221 and curling resurfaced as a demonstration sport after an absence of more than 50 years			2
in addition to marking the @entity6 debut of @entity100 speed skater @entity226 , the @entity228 also introduced the world to the @entity230 ( later immortalized in the 1993 film " @entity232 " )			1
today , visitors with just slightly less bobsleigh training than those four gentlemen can slide down the very same track at speeds of up to 75 miles per hour ( 120 km / h ) in a bobsleigh driven by a professional pilot			2
in summer , you can do the run in a bobsleigh on wheels or zip - line down the mountain from the 90 - meter ski jump			2
@entity247 , @entity24 ( 1992 ) at the @entity251 games , the newly unified @entity249 team included singles luger @entity252 in his second of what would be five olympic games winning his first of three gold medals			0
today , as a visitor , you can come as close as you 'll ever come to his experience on the speed luge at the @entity261 bobsleigh track -- a one - person luge that reaches speeds up to 55 miles per hour ( 89 kph )			1
or rub elbows with an @entity265 at a more relaxed pace at @entity267 in @entity268 , an alpine - style bed and breakfast run by former @entity6 skier @entity271			1
( her brother @entity272 , a gold medalist in the super-g at the @entity274 , works at the @entity268 ski resort			0
) @entity276 , @entity277 ( 2002 ) guided tours of @entity279 near @entity280 reveal some " backstage " secrets about the @entity6 events and visit some memorable spots , such as the ski jump where 20 - year - old @entity285 from @entity62 was a surprise gold - medal winner and undisputed crowd - pleaser in the @entity289 and @entity290 individual events			2
at the @entity292 , you can find out more about the region 's @entity6 skiing past , present and future , including an exhibition on the @entity100 women 's ski jumping team , which will compete for the first time in @entity6 history at @entity92			1
after taking a look at the @entity6 medals in the museum 's collection , head back to @entity276 and @entity306 where the medal ceremonies took place			2
@entity309 , @entity216 ( 2010 ) many venues from the @entity311 have been smoothly integrated or reintegrated into the @entity309 landscape			0
@entity313 , site of the opening and closing ceremonies , is back to being the home of the @entity317 ( @entity318 ) and @entity319 ( @entity320 ) and hockey venue @entity321 remains the home of the @entity325 @entity324			0
the @entity6 cauldron stands outside the @entity327			2
the @entity328 , where @entity331 speed skater @entity329 set new @entity6 records in the 5,000 and 10,000 meter races , is now a public skating rink , community center and future site of the interactive @entity337 , expected to open in late 2014			1
while there are @entity6 sites throughout the area , you might find yourself closest to your athletic dreams if you spend the night at the @entity343 , originally part of the @entity345 .			2

@entity6 venues past offer speed *thrills* to less competitive visitors
the @entity78 bobsleigh run is sometimes open to guest riders
take an evening lantern hike in @entity164 , @entity165 , for a more *leisurely* downhill experience
