-- at two goals to the good against @entity3 in their @entity5 quarterfinal it looked as if @entity6 were going to bury any lingering demons after their demoralizing @entity9 exit to @entity10			1
strikes from @entity13 forward @entity12 and @entity15 international @entity14 inside the ten opening minutes piled more misery on beleaguered @entity3 boss @entity18 as he weathered abuse from both sets of supporters inside @entity22			2
but the @entity23 made some inspired tactical changes and saw his side draw level thanks to fine goals from @entity29 international @entity27 and @entity31 midfielder @entity30 as only a string of saves from @entity6 's @entity35 goalkeeper @entity34 prevented @entity3 from a famous win			1
their draw now creates a headache for both clubs , as their hectic schedules between now and the end of the season means fixing a date for the replay will present a significant challenge			2
whoever wins will face @entity50 in the semifinals at @entity52			1
@entity18 was forced to withstand yet more abuse from @entity3 fans angry at his appointment which was added to by taunts from home fans who remember the @entity23 's many battles with @entity60 when he was manager at their archrivals @entity62			1
but after the game @entity18 told @entity64 : " i think we should have won the game			0
the second half we were on top , we created the best chances and were in control of the game			0
" on @entity73 's great chance late on he added : " @entity73 said @entity34 made a great save			0
we have to think about the first game then after we will think about @entity50			2
it 'll be difficult to win because @entity6 are a great side			2
" @entity60 told reporters : " we 're lucky to be in the @entity5			2
we ran out of legs -- our two full - backs , @entity81 and @entity82 , are just knackered			0
" @entity84 's taxing trip to @entity85 to play the first leg of their @entity88 last - 16 tie on thursday clearly showed in the opening stages as they sunk to a two - goal deficit			0
@entity12 struck first , looping a header over @entity93 from @entity95 's floated pass			0
@entity14 made it 2 - 0 moments later as his left wing free kick went through a crowd of bodies inside the area and crept into the far corner of the net			1
@entity93 made a fine double save to prevent @entity3 going 3 - 0 down when he stopped a powerful @entity14 effort before springing into action again as @entity106 's misplaced header almost looped into the net			1
but after @entity27 was introduced the game turned and on the hour mark he curled a superb effort into the top corner to give the away side hope			0
and the comeback was complete when @entity3 swept down field after a @entity6 attack and @entity30 cut inside his man to beat @entity34 with a precise left - footed finish			1
@entity118 had a chance to wrap the game up before @entity73 cut inside @entity121 and struck on goal from six yards out but @entity34 stuck out a leg to get a vital touch and divert the ball round the post			0
the other quarterfinal saw second tier sides @entity128 and @entity129 draw 0 - 0			1
the winner of that tie will face @entity133 side @entity132 in the other semifinal			1
in the @entity133 a late penalty from captain @entity136 helped @entity62 to a 3 - 2 victory over @entity138 , who opened the door for @entity3 to reclaim third spot in the race for @entity9 football			1
the clash at @entity145 was billed as a battle between two stars gunning for the player of the year crown -- @entity138 's @entity149 , and @entity62 's @entity150			1
going into the game @entity149 had ten goals in his last nine games , @entity150 11 in his last 11			0
and it was the @entity155 who struck first for @entity62 , tucking home from @entity159 's astute pass to register his 22nd goal of the season			0
but @entity138 hit back when @entity29 defender @entity162 nodded home @entity149 's cross right on halftime			2
just eight minutes after the break @entity166 grabbed his second , rifling home from inside the area after a set piece fell to him , and @entity138 looked set to build on their impressive 3 - 0 win over @entity172 in the first leg of their @entity88 last - 16 tie in midweek			1
but @entity62 responded with two goals in 16 minutes as mistakes from @entity15 international @entity177 and @entity179 goalkeeper @entity178 allowed @entity181 to fire @entity62 level			2
and with eight minutes remaining @entity183 bundled @entity150 over inside the penalty area and @entity136 slotted home the penalty to move @entity62 up to sixth in the table			0
@entity138 remain third , two points ahead of @entity3 , but their @entity189 rivals have a game in hand			1
the other @entity133 game on sunday saw @entity193 ease their relegation worries with a last - gasp 2 - 1 victory over @entity196			1
@entity196 went in front in the second half when @entity200 international @entity199 brought down @entity201 inside the area and the striker picked himself up to convert from the spot			0
@entity193 drew level when @entity179 international @entity206 floated a free kick in off the crossbar and in the second minute of injury time @entity210 picked out @entity211 who controlled before smashing a volley into the net			0
his side are now nine points clear of the drop zone .			0

@entity3 fight back from 2 - 0 down to draw with @entity6 in @entity5 last eight
goals from @entity27 and @entity30 bring @entity3 back from the brink
winner of the replay will face @entity50 in the semifinal at @entity52
@entity62 come back from 2 - 1 down to beat @entity138 in the @entity133
