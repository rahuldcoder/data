@entity0 will ask the @entity1 to review its decision allowing football players to unionize , arguing that student - athletes are not university employees but " students , first and foremost			1
" in a statement friday , the @entity8 university said it will follow labor board procedures but requested a review of the decision , saying it " overlooked or completely ignored " critical university testimony and " applied incorrect legal standards			2
" on wednesday , the board ruled that football players at @entity0 are employees and can unionize			1
" @entity0 considers its students who participate in @entity21 sports , including those who receive athletic scholarships , to be students , first and foremost , " @entity17 , vice president for university relations , said in the statement			1
" we believe that participation in athletic events is part of the overall educational experience for those students , not a separate activity			0
" @entity17 added , " unionization and collective bargaining are not the appropriate methods to address the concerns these students are raising			0
the life of a student - athlete is extremely demanding , but the academic side and the athletic side are inextricably linked			1
" read the board 's ruling ( @entity42 ) the university will ask for review with the full board to appeal the regional director 's decision , @entity17 said			1
the university 's request is due on april 9 ; the union 's brief is due seven days later			0
if the board grants the review , it will set a briefing schedule for both parties , the statement said			0
the players ' petition was a way to get a seat at the bargaining table in college sports and could change the landscape of the @entity21 model			1
but the board 's decision indicates that there was enough evidence presented that the athletes are employees of the university -- getting paid in the form of scholarships , working between 20 and 50 hours per week and generating millions of dollars for their institutions			1
the athletes have said they 're seeking better medical coverage , concussion testing , four - year scholarships and the possibility of being paid			0
but while former @entity0 quarterback @entity80 said he agrees with the reform issues set forth by the @entity82 and other groups , he does n't think unionizing is the way to achieve those goals			2
" while we agree with @entity82 's stated objectives , the decision made by the @entity1 ... is disconcerting to those of us that care deeply about the future success and stability of @entity0 athletics , " @entity80 said			1
@entity95 , labor law professor at @entity96 , said the ruling has " vast implications for the structure of the sport , if upheld			0
" but he noted an appeal would likely take years to resolve			0
the @entity21 promptly said that while it was n't party to the proceeding , it was " disappointed " with the board 's ruling and disagreed " with the notion that student - athletes are employees			1
" " we frequently hear from student - athletes , across all sports , that they participate to enhance their overall college experience and for the love of their sport , not to be paid , " said the statement from @entity21 chief legal officer @entity112			1
" while improvements need to be made , we do not need to completely throw away a system that has helped literally millions of students over the past decade alone attend college			0
" we want student - athletes -- 99 percent of whom will never make it to the professional leagues -- focused on what matters most -- finding success in the classroom , on the field and in life			1
" last week , @entity0 's president emeritus said that if the football players were successful forming a union , he could see the prestigious private institution giving up @entity21 football			1
" if we got into collective - bargaining situations , i would not take for granted that the @entity136 of the world would continue to play @entity21 sports , " @entity132 said at the annual conference for the @entity134			2
he further said that if the players won their fight , private institutions with high academic standards -- he specifically cited @entity144 and @entity145 universities -- could abandon the current mode to preserve academic integrity			0
he compared it with the pullback of the @entity151 schools decades ago when their conference decided to opt out of postseason play and to end athletic scholarships , preserving the emphasis on academics for the players			0
" in the 1950s , the ' @entity151 ' had some of the highest - ranked football teams in the country			0
the @entity163 teams were ranked in the top five or 10 at that time			0
they continue periodically to have ranked basketball teams , but they 've given up a certain kind of model of sports , " he said , adding that " under certain conditions " the same could happen at other private elite universities that " continue to play big - time sports			0
" @entity0 's appeal could go as far as the @entity175 @entity174 , and it could take years before there is a definitive decision			1
during his daylong testimony last week , former @entity0 quarterback @entity178 talked about year - round time requirements , at times 50 hours a week devoted to football			2
@entity178 said he had to give up his major related to pre-med studies because he could n't fit the classes into his schedule			0
@entity178 's sentiment was echoed by the @entity21 in a 2012 survey that asked athletes what they would change about their college experience			2
about 15 % of men 's football , baseball and basketball players said they would have had different majors had they not been athletes			2
twelve percent of @entity21 football players said athletics prevented them from majoring in what they wanted			1
the average time spent on athletics in season hovered around 40 hours per week for all three sports , according to the survey			0
that finding flies in the face of the @entity21 20 - hour rule , which states that , no matter the sport , coaches ca n't take up more than 20 hours of their players ' time .			2
