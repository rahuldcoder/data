@entity0 -- the @entity2 has passed up a chance to examine how far states can go to restrict unsolicited e-mails in efforts to block spammers from bombarding computer users			2
a tough anti-spam law will not be reviewed by the @entity2 , the court said monday			1
the high court without comment monday rejected @entity14 's appeal to keep its @entity15 in place			1
it was one of the toughest laws of its kind in the nation , the only one to ban noncommercial -- as well as commercial -- spam e-mail to consumers in that state			2
the justices ' refusal to intervene also means the conviction of prolific commercial spammer @entity28 will not be reinstated			1
his 2004 felony conviction was the first in the @entity32 for sending bulk unsolicited electronic messages			0
a @entity14 jury found @entity28 used several computers and servers to send as many as 24,000 spam e-mails in one day to @entity39 subscribers			0
he used false " header " info and sender domain names , according to court records			0
a search of his @entity47 , @entity48 , home found cds with more than 176 million e-mail addresses and 1.3 billion e-mail user names , some of them stolen by a former @entity39 employee			0
@entity28 was sentenced to nine years in prison , but the state high court eventually reversed the conviction			1
the state justices said the law was overbroad because some bulk e-mails might contain political , religious , or other speech that has traditionally been given higher @entity63 protection than typical " commercial speech			1
" such political speech might be a request for support from a candidate for elected office , while commercial speech might be a solicitation for a medical product , like a hair regrowth tonic			0
the @entity32 @entity2 was asked to weigh whether such anti-spam laws overreach into protected speech			1
despite the ruling , @entity28 remains behind bars because of a federal securities fraud conviction unrelated to the state spamming charges			0
the anti-spam case is @entity14 v. @entity28 ( 08 - 765 ) .			2

@entity32 @entity2 declines to hear appeal on @entity14 's tough anti-spam law
@entity14 law banned noncommercial as well as commercial spam
@entity89 's high court said the law might *violate* @entity63 free speech protection
@entity32 high court 's refusal to hear case means prolific spammer 's conviction is void
