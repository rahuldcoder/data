-- during the past few months , i have gently suggested to my patients that they receive the flu vaccine			1
many said yes , but some declined			0
today , as i look up @entity7 's national flu trend map , i see nearly the entire country painted in an alarming red , signifying " intense " flu activity			1
according to the @entity12 , 41 states are experiencing widespread flu outbreaks			2
there are 26 times more flu cases this year than last			2
and in @entity18 , near my primary care practice , a public health emergency was declared this past wednesday			0
i shake my head when seeing these headlines , and i vow to be more persuasive when it comes to giving the flu vaccine			1
more patients need to be protected against influenza by getting flu shots earlier in the season			1
like many other clinics across the country , my office is flooded with patients suffering from coughs , runny noses , fevers and body aches , all potentially caused by the flu			1
thankfully , the vast majority of adults survive			0
but others fare less successfully : the young , the elderly , and those with chronic conditions like asthma , diabetes or cancer			0
severe flu complications , like pneumonia , can hospitalize these patients , or worse , be fatal			1
according to @entity47 , a pediatrician at the @entity48 , between 43 and 153 children have died in the past 10 flu seasons combined			2
already , 18 children have died this season			2
one reason why the flu outbreak is so prevalent this year is that the predominant strain , @entity55 , has n't been this widely circulated since 2002 - 03 and is associated with a more severe illness			1
but another reason is the relatively low percentage of patients who received a flu shot			1
this year 's vaccine is well matched to the circulating viruses and , while not perfect , provides good protection			0
flu shots are about 60 % effective			1
but more than half of @entity67 skip the vaccine			0
only 46 % received one last year			0
this year 's numbers are about the same			0
the reason many cite , " i got the flu from the flu shot ! " is n't valid			1
there are no live viruses in the vaccine			0
if someone got sick after the shot , it 's because of a coincidental illness caused by the scores of other non-influenza viruses that can cause similar upper respiratory symptoms			2
others say , " i 've never had the shot before , and i 've been fine			0
" in some , the flu can be debilitating , leaving patients bedridden for days			1
in others , it can simply be a runny nose or a minor cough			0
but it 's still the flu and can be spread to more vulnerable patients , with disastrous consequences for them			1
according to @entity95 , a viral respiratory disease expert at @entity97 in @entity98 , " every time you vaccinate yourself , you 're not just protecting yourself , but you 're protecting everyone you know , including individuals who are young or pregnant			0
" it 's still not too late for a flu shot			0
go get one if you have n't already			0
although its protective action wo n't take effect for about two weeks , the flu season has n't peaked			1
i realize i have to do a better job to dispel these myths in the exam room and convince more of my patients to receive a flu shot			2
but patients can also help			0
read the headlines and learn from the current flu crisis			1
then be proactive and get a vaccine earlier in future flu seasons			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity122 .			2

@entity122 : nearly every state has " intense " flu activity
**pho** : more patients need to be protected by getting flu shots earlier in the season
he says one reason the flu is so prevalent is that a main strain is associated with severe illness
**pho** : read the headlines and learn from the current flu crisis
