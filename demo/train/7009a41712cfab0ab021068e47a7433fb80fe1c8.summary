" while the district does not condone bullying , it also does not allow weapons to be brought on our school campuses for any reason , " a spokeswoman for @entity8 said tuesday			1
" students who violate this rule will be held accountable			0
" @entity19 's mother sent her 17 - year - old son to school with a stun gun because , she said , administrators did n't do enough to stop the bullying against him			1
students take part in anti-bullying programs from kindergarten through 12th grade , district spokeswoman @entity25 said			1

" the district does not condone bullying , " she said			1
" students who violate the rights of others through bullying behaviors are held accountable			2
" the school district held an expulsion hearing last week and the decision was announced tuesday			1

" he may return to school in @entity8 on jan. 7 , 2013			2

he raised it in the air , setting off an electric charge , and sending the group scurrying , @entity19 said			2
unlike a @entity81 , which fires barbs attached to long wires at a target , a stun gun must be near or pressed against a person to shock him			1
" i got kicked out of school for me bringing the weapon to school , but i honestly do n't think that that was fair , " @entity19 said			1

in the idealistic society , it should n't matter			0
people should be able to wear what they want to wear			0
" @entity52 contends that school officials have n't done enough to protect all students on campus			2

it is a common complaint among lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( @entity136 ) students			0
a 2009 survey of 7,261 middle and high school students found that nearly nine out of 10 @entity136 students had experienced harassment at school over the previous year and nearly two - thirds felt unsafe because of their sexual orientation			1
@entity19 said rumors around campus suggested he was " doing nasty stuff " with teachers			2
the rumors took their toll			0
" i was at my wit 's end			0
i did n't know what to do and i thought about suicide , " @entity19 said			2
