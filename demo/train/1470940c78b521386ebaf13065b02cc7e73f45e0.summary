@entity0 -- a @entity3 report released tuesday on the military 's @entity5 mortuary finds that not only did some remains of @entity9 troops end up in landfills â € ” so did remains from the 9/11 attacks			1
@entity13 is where the remains of deceased @entity9 armed forces first arrive home from overseas			0
how the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) handled military remains caused an uproar last november , and the new report says much the same thing happened to remains from the @entity3 attack and the @entity26 , @entity27 , crash site of september 11 , 2001			1
of the nearly 3,000 victims of the 9/11 attacks , 224 were killed at the @entity3 and in @entity27			1
the report says that in 2002 , some unidentified and already cremated remains from those attacks were placed in sealed containers , handed over to a biomedical waste contractor and then transported in containers and incinerated a second time			1
the assumption on the part of the mortuary , the report says , was that nothing was left			1
but then mortuary management found that some residual material had in fact remained after the second cremation and that the contractor had disposed of it in a landfill			1
and according to the report , " the landfill disposition was not disclosed in the contractual disposal agreement			1
" confusion over just exactly what the words " final disposition " meant was one of the reasons that unidentified 9/11 remains ended up in a landfill			2
retired gen. @entity59 , who is in charge of the independent review subcommittee investigation , told reporters , " we think ' final disposition ' needs to be the final resting place ( of remains )			0
" @entity59 noted that some states legally define " final disposition " of remains as delivering them to the crematorium , and he added , " we do n't agree " with what many consider to be that sort of final disposition			0
the report notes that such disposition ceased in 2008 and by 2009 a new policy was in place			0
now , unidentified portions of remains are cremated and " retired at sea			2
" the @entity80 issued a statement tuesday night expressing concern " about the unacceptable handing of remains at @entity5			1
" " the president has been briefed on the independent review of @entity18 and strongly supports the @entity3 's efforts to make needed systemic structural changes so that these types of incidents never happen again , " the @entity80 statement said			1
" the @entity9 has a solemn obligation to compassionately and professionally care for fallen service members and their families , and those we tragically lost on 9/11			0
" why 9/11 remains ended up in the @entity18 is not explained in the new report and was not the focus of the investigation , said @entity59			2
he said the report 's purpose is to address how mortuary operations should be reformed and controlled			2
@entity59 says the real problem with mortuary operations was a failure of command and the command structure			0
he said the @entity108 has very strict regulations that it enforces on the handling of nuclear weapons , and that spirit needs to be adopted in this sphere of operations , too			0
" we need to understand that just like the nuclear surety business , this a 100 % no - fail mission , and that means the same level of care needs to be taken with regard to the final resting place of our fallen , " @entity59 said			0
the issue came up earlier this month in a letter from rep. @entity126 , @entity127 , to secretary of defense @entity128 in which @entity126 inquired whether 9/11 victims ended up in the landfill			0
" can the @entity108 confirm that no 9/11 victim 's remains were incinerated , mixed with medical waste , and sent to a landfill ? " @entity126 wrote in the letter			1
" in her november 2011 correspondence , acting undersecretary for personnel and readiness @entity136 stated to me that the five hijackers responsible for the @entity3 attack were also identified by @entity5 from dna samples			2
how were the remains of the hijackers handled ? " a spokesman for @entity126 said the secretary of defense has not responded to those questions .			0

new : @entity80 endorses efforts for " systemic structural changes "
@entity3 report : some cremated remains were handed over to a biomedical contractor
the remains were incinerated a second time and disposed of in a landfill
the mortuary had *erroneously* assumed that no remains were left , report says
