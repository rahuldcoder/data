@entity0 -- the highest - ranking catholic church cleric charged and convicted in the landmark child sexual abuse trial will remain in jail for the time being , a @entity0 judge ordered tuesday			1
monsignor @entity7 was found guilty friday of one count of child endangerment , the first time a @entity11 church leader has been convicted of such a charge			1
the trial marked the first time @entity11 prosecutors have charged not just the priests who allegedly committed abuses but also church leaders for failing to stop them			0
@entity7 is the highest - ranking cleric accused of imperiling children by helping cover up sexual abuse			2
he was found not guilty on a second count of endangerment and on a charge of conspiring to protect a priest accused of abuse			0
@entity7 's defense team argued during the trial that their client repeatedly told higher - ups about the alleged abuse and , under strict orders from the late cardinal @entity32 , had no authority to remove priests from the ministry			1
on monday , @entity7 's defense attorneys filed a motion requesting that their client be released on house arrest pending his scheduled august 13 sentencing			1
he could face three - and - a - half to seven years in prison for his conviction on the third - degree felony			0
" with every fiber in my body , ( fleeing ) is a non-issue , " said @entity43 , one of @entity7 's lawyers			2
following friday 's verdict , @entity43 criticized the decision not to let his client remain free on bond prior to sentencing , calling it " an unspeakable miscarriage of justice ( for ) a 61 - year - old man with no prior record and long - established ties to the community			1
" assistant district attorney @entity60 vehemently opposed house arrest			2
" it 's absurd , " @entity60 said			0

he wore full clerical garb during the 50 days of the trial and 13 days of jury deliberations			0

@entity84 , who lives alone , was briefly called to the witness stand to confirm her understanding of house arrest and to prove her residency to the judge			2
" i 'm free , " she told the court , regarding her availability to house the monsignor			0
at the conclusion of tuesday 's hearing , @entity0 @entity100 judge @entity99 delayed her decision on whether @entity7 should be placed under house arrest rather than jailed until his sentencing			1
@entity99 allowed prosecutors a week to consult legal analysts and rev. @entity108 -- who was sworn in as an expert witness on @entity110 and its canon law during the trial -- to determine what , if any , steps are to be taken in the event @entity7 fled to the @entity116 , where there is no extradition			0
she also instructed the defense to consult with their client to ensure he was aware of the consequences , should he flee			0
" get the hell out of here , he 's not going to the @entity116 , " another one of @entity7 's attorneys , @entity124 , told reporters outside of the courthouse , adding that his client is incredibly strong considering the circumstances			1
" although @entity99 did not grant the defense motion for release on house arrest pending sentencing , she did initiate the procedure for receiving an electronic monitoring device			1
the average wait time for such a device is three to four weeks			0
if granted and @entity7 were to violate the conditions of house arrest , the judge could sentence him immediately as well as impose the maximum sentence of seven years in prison			1
" the risk of flight is going up because he now has something to lose , " assistant district attorney @entity147 told reporters outside the courthouse			0
" this case is unprecedented and on a lot of fronts , it 's a case of first impressions			0
