-- a surprise inspection by the @entity2 has resulted in a failing grade for one of the plushest cruise ships afloat			1
according to a report by the @entity2 's @entity9 , the cruise ship @entity7 was cited repeatedly for using an " organized effort " to remove 15 trolleys of food from the ship 's galley to individual crew cabins to " avoid inspection			1
" the snap inspection of the @entity7 on june 17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , was conducted after an anonymous crew member sent still photographs to the @entity2 showing meat in crew cabin sinks and trays of food in the corridors in the hallways outside those cabins			1
it resulted in a failing grade of 82 for the @entity7			1
any grade less than 84 is considered " less than satisfactory , " according to the @entity9 website			2
in its advertisements @entity32 , the cruise line that owns the @entity7 , emphasizes luxury and what it calls a " world class " culinary experience			1
the company said its ships have an average passenger load of a little more than 300 compared to some cruise lines with ships that carry anywhere from 2,000 to 5,000 passengers			0
the company said it charges passengers an average of $ 5,000 per week to sail			0
one crew member who was on board the @entity7 said that his superiors ordered him and other crew members to sleep with food inside their cabins			1
@entity55 , who had a 40 - day contract to serve as a pastry chef on the vessel , said a trolley full of salami and even unrefrigerated blue cheese was stored in crew cabins			1
@entity55 said food was hidden night after night to avoid health inspections			1
passengers lack public info on cruise ship crime a spokeswoman for the @entity70 - based @entity32 , @entity68 e-mailed @entity0 prior to the public posting of the @entity2 score , stating that the firm was " deeply disappointed " in the outcome of the inspection			1
in fact , @entity76 said the final grade was an 84 , although it actually turned out to be 82			2
the company said it had always scored in the highest range of grades in the past			2
records published by the @entity2 showed that @entity32 ships had been graded in the high 90s and even 100 on occasion			2
@entity76 said the @entity7 inspection last month in @entity19 was an anomaly			1
neither she nor anyone else at the company responded to questions from @entity0 asking whether any employees were disciplined			0
@entity93 -- a @entity94 - based lawyer who specializes in filing lawsuits against cruise lines for injury and wrongful termination -- said that , in his experience , it 's common for cruise ships to hide food from government inspectors			2
" there is typically a scramble that takes place , " he said			0
" that 's what we learn from crew members			2
" @entity93 , who wrote about the @entity112 incident on his website cruiselaw.com , said he believes managers on board the ship " were essentially caught playing a game			0
" " the @entity2 was alerted by crew members who were concerned about the hygiene on the ship and they went in and verified their complaints , " he said			1
according to the @entity2 final report , its inspectors poured chlorine liquid over the discarded food on board the @entity7 to prevent any of it from being re-used			1
other than a promise to correct actions that led to the problems , the owners of the ship were not fined , nor was the ship stopped from proceeding on its scheduled trip along @entity19 's @entity131 to @entity132			1
that 's because the @entity2 has no authority to correct any of the issues			1
the @entity2 's @entity9 employs inspectors from the @entity137 and , even though it 's a considered a regulatory program , it only has the authority to ask the cruise line to correct its actions			1
" @entity9 requires all ships to submit corrective action statements for deficiencies , " the program states on its website			0
" @entity9 does not verify that the deficiencies have been corrected until after conducting the next vessel inspection or re-inspection			0
" in a cruise ship crisis , what should happen ? this year , six cruise ships , including the @entity7 , have received failing grades by the @entity2 , according to its database			1
that 's three times more than the number of cruise ships that failed inspections in 2012			0
@entity2 spokeswoman @entity160 noted that " every case is different , " and each case goes through several reviews before scores are finally posted			2
the cruise industry has been in the spotlight after a series of disasters that have captured headlines			0
the @entity170 hit a reef off the coast of @entity173 in january 2012 , killing 32 people			0
then there was february 's @entity177 cruise , which experienced an engine fire in the control room that led to a loss of electrical power for five days			0
in may , @entity183 's @entity182 caught fire , forcing the ship to cut short the trip			0
nevertheless , a recent survey by @entity188 found overall customer satisfaction with eight major cruise lines remains high			0
@entity191 , @entity183 and @entity192 came in first , second and third , respectively , in customer satisfaction , while @entity177 ranked last			0
@entity32 was not included in the survey , which survey measured seven factors that affect a customer 's experience : service , state of the room , food , the efficiency of boarding and departing on the ship , entertainment , cost and excursions			2
