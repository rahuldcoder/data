@entity0 , @entity1 -- freedom lovers everywhere over a certain age recall the thrilling news 20 years ago that @entity6 had been released from a @entity8 , @entity9 , jail			1
after 27 years of isolation and hard labor , the world 's most famous political prisoner emerged without bitterness , his humanity intact			1
when asked what he most missed while in prison , @entity6 replied that it was hearing the sounds of children laughing			1
now 92 and frail , @entity6 has declined to participate in this week 's many celebrations in his honor except one : the opening of @entity24 and the address to the nation by @entity9 president @entity27			1
as with all things political in this young and often raucous democracy , politicians and pundits are debating whether @entity6 should have skipped this event as well			1
@entity27 's last admission of personal misconduct , fathering his 20th child out of wedlock with the daughter of close friend , has become a national scandal and international embarrassment			0
just two years ago , he confessed to having unprotected sex with an hiv - positive family friend , who then accused him of rape			1
in a country coping with one of the world 's highest incidence of hiv / aids , and with a strong official commitment to gender equality , many of @entity6 's most fervent admirers do n't want him seen anywhere near @entity27			1
but @entity6 went to jail not to demonstrate personal virtue but in a commitment to freedom , equality and the rule of law , which his appearance in @entity24 reaffirms			1
@entity27 is the duly elected president of a nation defined by strict allegiance to a democratic constitution			0
@entity27 has respected the rule of law and shows no inclination to use his huge parliamentary majority to rewrite the constitution for political advantage			2
when @entity6 was president , he defied his political advisers and voluntarily appeared before a magistrate so a claim of defamation against him could be adjudicated under due process , available to all citizens			2
@entity6 expects no less from his successors ; nor should we			2
preventing abuses of power whether by a privileged minority or by an unrestrained majority is a growing challenge for @entity9 's fledgling democracy			0
the electorate is increasingly restive over policies that have failed to reduce chronic unemployment in excess of 25 percent , curb corruption or address extreme economic and social inequities			0
nor have policies been able to adequately overcome the legacy of damage caused by apartheid to family and community values , education and other basic services			0
the nation is struggling with a lack of respect for authority and the rule of law , especially among a growing number of alienated youth			1
@entity9 still has many advantages , including an economy larger than the combined gross domestic products of the rest of @entity110 minus @entity111 , and it draws talent and strength from immigrants and political refugees who have created what @entity117 political scientist @entity116 calls " the world 's second global nation after the @entity120			0
" at issue is whether @entity9 can uphold the minimum of shared values necessary for sustaining peace and allowing a decent society to flourish			0
@entity6 must continue to embody the roles for @entity9 that @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 serve in protecting and advancing democracy in @entity120			1
and like them , @entity6 's example inspires others and has become a global public good			2
president @entity135 recalls in " @entity136 " how @entity9 awakened his interest in politics as a young college student , provoking him to address a public rally for the first time and to describe events there as " a struggle that demands we choose sides			0
not between black and white			0
not between rich and poor			0
no , it 's a harder choice ... between fairness and injustice			0
between commitment and indifference , a choice between right and wrong ... " @entity6 rarely talks about his own character but in his autobiography , " @entity159 , " says he credits any success he has achieved to a trait inherited from his father , " a stubborn sense of fairness			1
" it is an ideal few have upheld to @entity6 's standard -- but one we should all seek to emulate			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			0

@entity165 : 20 years ago today , @entity6 was released from @entity8 jail
@entity165 : after 27 years , @entity6 emerged " without bitterness , his humanity intact "
@entity6 maintains commitment to democracy , freedom and rule of law , he writes
