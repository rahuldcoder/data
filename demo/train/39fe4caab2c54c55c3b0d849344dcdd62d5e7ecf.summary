@entity0 -- @entity4 , the @entity5 teenager whose abduction triggered a manhunt across the @entity8 , has survived " a tremendous , horrific ordeal " and faces a slow healing process , her father said monday			1
" i am very proud of her and i love her very much , " @entity11 said			0
" she is surrounded by the love of her family , friends and community			0
" but authorities kept the detail of that horrific ordeal close to the vest monday , two days after the man accused of abducting @entity4 and killing her mother and brother was killed by an @entity27 agent			1
the 16 - year - old was found alive after a frantic , week - long search that stretched from southern @entity5 to the wilderness of central @entity31 , more than 1,000 miles away , where she was found at a campsite by a mountain lake			1
at a news conference in @entity0 , @entity11 thanked investigators as well as reporters and social media users who spread the story " across and beyond " the @entity41			0
how to help @entity4 " have no doubt that this did make a difference , " he said			1
but he said it was time " for us to grieve and move on to the healing process , " and he pleaded for the " respect and time " needed for that to happen			0
@entity4 's ordeal came to an end after a tip from horseback riders sent @entity27 agents swarming to a camping spot outside @entity55 , @entity31			1
@entity4 , the man investigators had sought in her disappearance , was shot in a confrontation with an @entity27 tactical agent			1
@entity4 told authorities that @entity4 fired at least once before being shot , @entity61 @entity60 said			1
" obviously we would have liked for mr. @entity4 to surrender and face justice in the court of law , " @entity60 said			1
" but that 's not going to be the case			0
" @entity4 did not appear to have significant physical injuries and was reunited with her father sunday			1
she was unaware that her mother and brother were dead until after @entity4 was killed , when she was told of their killings by @entity27 interviewers , @entity60 said			1
@entity60 would discuss no details of @entity4 's abduction except to say she was under " extreme duress " the entire time			1
he said the investigation is still going on , but cautioned , " we might never know some of these answers			2
" " when you get a completely irrational act like we 've seen here , with two murders and a kidnapping , sometimes you 're not going to come up with a rational explanation of what happened , " he said			0
grief to euphoria : @entity90 rescued , suspect killed ' @entity92 ' and his interest in @entity4 @entity4 's friendship with the @entity11 family had been long and close , predating @entity4 's birth			1
@entity4 referred to him as " @entity92			1
" but there were some signs that @entity4 was infatuated with @entity4 and signs he was trying to lure the family to his home in rural @entity103 , near the @entity105 border , her grandparents said			1
the signs were subtle , according to grandparents @entity106 and @entity107 , also of @entity0			0
" he seemed to enjoy being with @entity4 and her friends ... more and more , " @entity108 said , shaking his head			1
" but he 's been with the kids for years			0
" " there was no danger sign , nothing that you would act on , say it was wrong , " he said			0
" it was just friendly			0
" but a friend of @entity4 's said she saw a different side to the relationship between @entity4 and the teen			1
@entity122 told @entity1 that she was in a car with @entity4 and @entity4 , 40 , a few months ago when he told @entity4 he had a crush on her			2
suspect 's father once held teen at gunpoint he followed it up by saying if he was her age , he would date @entity4 , @entity129 said			1
@entity4 was unnerved by the comments , but did not tell her mother because she did not want to ruin the close relationship that her parents had with @entity4 , @entity129 said			2
but @entity4 did not want to be alone with @entity4 after that , according to @entity129			2
" i do n't think she would have gone willingly with him at all , " she said			2
in an earlier episode , @entity129 recalled a trip that @entity4 and @entity4 took to @entity141			2
the trip was supposed to be for one week , but @entity4 told @entity129 that they came back after two days because @entity4 was upset that she was n't paying enough attention to him			1
' you ca n't really tell the book by its cover ' @entity107 said @entity4 would have done anything for them and they would have returned the favor			1
" my message is to parents : just be more aware , more conscious of what 's going on , " @entity107 said			0
" life gets busy , but take the time			0
if anything , learn something from this and that is just to be more aware for your children			0
" @entity108 added : " i guess you ca n't really tell the book by its cover , " he said			2
" it was just complete shock			0
we did n't have any idea			2
i do n't know what you would look for			2
" in the weeks before @entity4 's home in rural @entity103 went up in flames , he pleaded for the @entity175 to visit him one last time			2
he had lost the home to foreclosure and said he was moving back to @entity178			0
" we feel it was planned at this point based on the information that 's out there , " said @entity107			0
" it 's so unfortunate			0
apparently he tried to get her up there before , but she could n't go and so ... she went , took the dog and the kids			2
" @entity4 went missing after cheerleading practice on august 3			2
the next day , the bodies of her mother , @entity191 , 42 , and 8 - year - old brother , @entity192 , were found about 45 miles east of @entity0 , in @entity4 's burned house in @entity194			1
the body of a dog was also recovered , police said			0
the horror spurred an @entity199 and a manhunt , which zeroed in the @entity31 highlands after @entity4 's blue @entity202 was found outside @entity55			1
then there was a sighting of the pair by horseback riders , who considered them poorly equipped for the environment			0
' red flags ' @entity209 , one of those riders , said sunday that they saw multiple " red flags " during their brief encounter , including the brand - new camping equipment they carried and the pajama - like bottoms @entity4 was wearing			1
it was " just like a square peg going into a round hole , " @entity209 said			0
" they did n't fit			1
" another rider , @entity219 , said it looked like @entity4 " had a scared look on her face , " adding about @entity4 : " i just had a gut feeling about him			1
" unaware of the @entity199 , however , the horseback riders continued on , and only after seeing a news report on the pair upon returning home did the group put the puzzle pieces together			0
" when i seen that picture on the screen , i told my wife , i said , ' that is the girl that was up on that mountain , ' " @entity209 recalled			0
hundreds of law enforcement agents started to scour 300 square miles of rough terrain -- dense forests , steep valleys and peaks over 8,000 feet -- hampered by the smoke from nearby wildfires			0
key moments in the manhunt late saturday afternoon , they spotted the pair 's campsite near @entity250 , about 30 miles from @entity55			0
but the topography was so steep , helicopters had to drop authorities off far away from the camp			0
hostage rescue teams had to hike more than two hours to get to the scene , local sheriffs ' departments said			0
they moved in carefully so they would n't alert @entity4 that they were coming			1
they moved in after @entity4 and the girl were separated , unshering @entity4 to an area where a helicopter could whisk her away			2
at some point , a " confrontation " ensued between authorities and @entity4 , @entity60 said			1
the confrontation ended when an @entity27 tactical agent shot and killed the murder and kidnapping suspect			2
@entity1 's @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278 contributed to this report .			0
