-- " we are now locked in a rolling filibuster on every issue , which is totally gridlocking the @entity3			1
it is wrong for @entity6			0
" who said that ? democrat @entity9 , majority leader of the @entity3 ? guess again			1
try former @entity11 leader @entity10 , bemoaning the troubled state of the @entity3 in the late 1990s			2
no recent majority leader of either party has been saved the headache of trying to lead a @entity3 in which minorities can exploit the rules and stymie the chamber			1
this is not a new problem			0
@entity9 may face a particularly unrestrained minority			1
but generations of @entity3 leaders from @entity24 to @entity25 have felt compelled to seek changes in @entity3 rules to make the chamber a more governable place			1
twice this week , the @entity3 has opened debate with its party leaders engaged in a caustic battle over @entity9 's plans to seek changes to @entity3 rules in january			1
@entity9 argues that @entity11 have engaged in unprecedented levels of filibustering			0
@entity11 leader @entity38 blames what he calls @entity9 's weak leadership , arguing that @entity11 ' parliamentary tactics are a natural response to @entity9 's partisan ways			1
there is no innocent party in the parliamentary arms race that engulfs the @entity3			2
still , many argue that @entity11 go overboard in their willingness to exploit @entity3 rules			2
indeed , since 2007 , @entity3 records show that @entity11 have filibustered or threatened to filibuster more than 360 times , a historic record			2
reform of the @entity3 is overdue			2
in 1997 , with republicans controlling the @entity3 , author @entity54 and i advocated reforms that sought to trim the filibuster while preserving minority rights			1
today , with @entity60 in control , i again think changes in @entity3 rules are due : @entity3 should limit the number of motions subject to a filibuster a top priority should be to eliminate filibusters of the " motion to proceed " to a bill and the three motions that are required to send a bill to conference with the @entity72			1
when the majority seeks to call up a bill on the floor for consideration , the leader offers a motion to proceed			0
because @entity3 rules deem this motion " debatable , " it takes 60 votes to cut off debate and come to a vote on the motion			2
banning the filibuster on this motion would still allow a minority to filibuster the underlying bill and amendments to it			0
but it would give a majority the right to set the chamber 's legislative agenda			0
the change might also rein in senators ' secret " holds " because the majority leader would no longer need broad support to advance a bill to the floor			0
similarly , debate could be trimmed by banning filibusters on the three steps required to send a bill to conference with the @entity72			0
conference committees have gone the way of the dodo bird because minorities have been willing to filibuster the steps required to send bills to conference			0
banning such filibusters would encourage the use of conference committees and restore the involvement of rank - and - file senators in the process of negotiating bicameral agreements			0
senators would still retain the right to filibuster agreements that emerged from conference			0
ratchet down the number of votes required to invoke cloture the first cloture vote would require 60 votes , as is required under @entity3 rules			2
if that failed , the next vote would require 57 votes , then 54 votes , and so on , until the @entity3 reached a simple majority vote for cloture			0
to guarantee the minority adequate time to debate and amend bills , i would tie the number of days of advance notice of a coming cloture vote to the number of votes required for cloture			0
the fewer the votes required , the longer the advance notice			0
coupling new cloture thresholds and notice requirements would allow the @entity3 to reach votes by simple majority while still protecting the minority 's parliamentary rights			1
@entity3 should experiment with new modes of advice and consent for nominations the confirmation process is a mess , with nominees often waiting months for hearings and confirmation votes			1
the @entity3 should consider new " fast - track " confirmation rules			1
for executive branch appointees , the fast track might fix the length of @entity3 consideration , guaranteeing a confirmation vote within , say , three months			1
for judicial nominations , fast - track consideration might be given to candidates recommended by bipartisan commissions in their home states			1
@entity168 : gridlock in @entity169 ? blame the @entity11 if the @entity72 nominates a candidate approved by such a commission , the @entity3 would fast - track the nominee to a confirmation vote			1
fast - tracks protect the minority 's right to scrutinize presidential appointees , but ensure that nominees are guaranteed confirmation votes within a reasonable period of time			1
such reforms would restore some semblance of balance to the @entity3			0
for that reason , the minority party is likely to oppose them			0
even members of the majority might balk at trimming their procedural rights			0
that is the unfortunate history of @entity3 reform : senators rarely want to give up their parliamentary advantages			2
because changes to @entity3 rules can be filibustered , efforts to reform the @entity3 typically crash and burn			1
under some conditions , majorities can avoid filibusters of their reform proposals by using what senators term the " constitutional option			2
" but as this week 's outrage on the @entity3 floor suggests , the process of an overhaul can be as explosive as the actual reform			1
there 's no easy path			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			0

@entity214 : minority has always exploited filibuster rules to hang up rival proposals
@entity9 's plans to reform procedures have faced tough *opposition* , she says
@entity225 : @entity3 should set limits on filibuster rules that are fair to each party
@entity225 : confirmation process is *glacial* and *contentious* and needs " fast - track " option
