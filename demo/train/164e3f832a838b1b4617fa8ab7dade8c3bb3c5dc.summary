-- two years later , the story of @entity3 's death remains a high - interest topic			1
here are some of the key stories we 've published since the world 's most - wanted terrorist was killed , from the first breaking news story to the latest disputes over what happened that day			1
news breaks president @entity14 announced @entity3 's death shortly before midnight et on may 1 , 2011 , more than an hour after the @entity16 and social media began exploding with reports of his demise			1
you can see here how the news unfolded on our live blog , including video of @entity14 's historic announcement and jubilant celebrations across the @entity28			1
the main story that followed , which announced the end of the decade - long manhunt , had more than 21,000 comments and nearly 130,000 @entity34 recommendations			2
the news also set what was then a @entity38 record as people posted an average of 3,400 messages per second			0
the aftermath in the days and weeks following the raid , more details would be released about how it all went down			0
how did the @entity28 know @entity3 was there ? who took part in the mission , and who knew about it ? why was @entity3 killed instead of taken prisoner ? over time , some of the details initially put out by the @entity54 were clarified or changed			1
some are still disputed today			0
there were several other headaches for @entity28 officials to deal with			1
there was a full - throated debate about whether to release grisly photos of @entity3 's body to the public			2
but in the end , @entity14 , not wanting to incite further violence , chose to keep the photos classified			0
" we do n't need to spike the football , " he told @entity67			0
the killing also created tension that needed to be smoothed over with @entity72 , which was outraged that the @entity28 chose to carry out the @entity3 mission there without first informing its leaders			1
and then there was the downed helicopter @entity28 officials hoped to retrieve from @entity3 's compound because of security concerns over the stealth technology of its unusual tail assembly			1
a few days after the raid , @entity28 officials unveiled videos of @entity3 that were recovered in the raid			1
you can watch all of them here			0
perhaps the most well - known video of this stash shows a hunched - over @entity3 , draped in a blanket , using a remote control to watch television			2
also taken in the raid were documents , disks , thumb drives , computers and other intelligence that would be pored over for evidence of further terrorist plots			0
years later after @entity3 's death , much praise was heaped on the elite @entity102 who carried out the raid : the anonymous " quiet professionals " who live by a code to keep their sensitive missions secret			1
but one former member of the team , @entity110 , detailed the mission in his 2012 best - seller " @entity110			0
" the book started a debate about honor , ethics and cultural values in the military ; the @entity119 said @entity120 included classified material in the book and did n't follow protocol for pre-publication review			0
the raid was also portrayed in the film " @entity128 , " which focuses on the @entity3 manhunt and was nominated for five @entity129			2
three @entity28 senators -- @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 -- called the film " grossly inaccurate and misleading , " especially the movie 's suggestion that harsh interrogations helped find @entity3			1
the filmmakers responded by saying the film condensed 10 years of intelligence work into a 2Â½ hour film			0
this year , @entity142 published a profile on a @entity102 who said he was the one who shot @entity3			2
his account contradicted some of the details in @entity120 's book			0
another seal , however , told @entity151 , @entity0 's national security analyst , that the @entity142 story is " complete bs			0
" reflecting on the two - year anniversary of @entity3 's death , @entity151 said the @entity28 forces may have killed the man , but they did not kill his ideology			1
@entity159 has now morphed into a " loose jihadist ideological movement " that spawned the @entity161 , @entity151 said , and it is this " @entity162 " that is still very much a threat to @entity28 .			2
