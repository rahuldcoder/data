@entity0 -- an appeal over singer @entity4 's " wardrobe malfunction " and brief partial nudity on national television has reached the @entity7 , the latest free speech episode over indecent , if fleeting , images and words on the public airwaves			1
the @entity14 administration has asked the @entity7 to decide whether record government fines against @entity16 should be allowed to stand			1
a federal appeals court last november ruled for the network and its affiliates , saying the @entity21 's sanctions were improper			1
the agency had punished the network with a $ 550,000 fine after the pop singer 's breast was briefly exposed during a live halftime show with fellow entertainer @entity27 at the @entity28			1
the @entity7 is currently deciding a separate but related issue over whether @entity21 enforcement policies violate the free speech rights of broadcasters airing profanity and sexual content , both in live and scripted form			1
the @entity36 in its appeal over the @entity4 incident told the high court there is no " fleeting images exemption from indecency enforcement " and that the singer 's act was " shocking and pandering , " airing " during a prime - time broadcast of a sporting event that was marketed as family entertainment and contained no warning that it would include nudity			1
" but @entity16 countered that the government in recent decades has applied inconsistent rules to indecent words and images , punishing some instances and ignoring others			0
the three - judge @entity58 - based 3rd @entity57 agreed , finding for a second time the @entity21 had acted " arbitrarily and capriciously , " since the commission did not give the media companies proper prior warning about subsequent changes in its enforcement policies			1
" the balance of the evidence weighs heavily against the @entity21 's contention that its restrained enforcement policy for fleeting material extended only to fleeting words and not to fleeting images , " wrote judge @entity65 for the 2 - 1 majority			1
she said the agency rules changed suddenly , a month after the @entity4 incident in @entity76			2
" an agency may not apply a policy to penalize conduct that occurred before the policy was announced , " said the judge			2
@entity16 now has a month to formally reply in writing to the high court , it is expected to urge the justices to stay out of the case			1
the high court would not decide whether to accept the appeal for review until june or perhaps later this fall			1
if placed on the docket , oral arguments and a ruling would not likely happen until sometime next year			2
after viewer complaints and national media attention , the @entity21 said the @entity4 incident was obscene			2
in addition to @entity16 , 20 of its affiliates also were fined			0
@entity96 quickly reacted at the time to the visual shocker by increasing the limit on indecency fines tenfold , up to $ 325,000 per violation per network			2
and it said each local affiliate that aired such incidents also could be punished by the same amount			0
the @entity21 claimed the network had " alarm bells " something might have been up , suggesting @entity4 and @entity27 may have planned ripping off the woman 's bustier , exposing her breast for nine - sixteenths of a second			1
family advocacy groups had blasted the appeals court 's 2011 opinion			1
" today 's ruling reaches the level of judicial stupidity and is a sucker - punch to families everywhere			0
in rendering an opinion it wishes to foist on the nation , the @entity123 has chosen to ignore the law , the facts , @entity7 precedent , the intent of the @entity96 and the will of the @entity133 people , " said @entity122 president @entity121			1
" how can nudity and a striptease in front of 90 million unsuspecting tv viewers not qualify as indecency ? " there was no immediate reaction from the @entity16 or the other networks to the @entity21 's appeal to the high court			1
the administration 's request comes as the high court is preparing a separate ruling in coming weeks on larger constitutional issues surrounding programming content			1
the justices in 2009 narrowly upheld the authority of the @entity21 to punish networks for airing profanity			2
but they refused to decide whether the commission 's policy violates the @entity157 guarantee of free speech			2
it ruled at the time only on the government 's enforcement power			0
then in january , the justices revisited the issue and have been working behind the scenes on one of the most closely watched petitions this term			0
the government clampdown on obscene images and words began in 2003			0
the changes became known as the @entity172 , as it stemmed from singer @entity174 's acceptance speech at the live awards show on @entity176 , in which he uttered the phrase " really , really , f --- ing brilliant			0
" the commission specifically cited celebrities @entity180 and @entity182 for potty - mouth language in the 2002 and 2003 @entity184 , which aired live on @entity185			0
@entity190 , in an apparent scripted moment , said , " have you ever tried to get cow s -- t out of a @entity189 purse ? it 's not so f --- ing simple			0
" a separate complaint against @entity194 involved " @entity195 , " a scripted police drama , and a complaint against @entity16 involved " @entity198 , " a news and interview program			0
enforcement of the law , as well as fines and sanctions for the incidents , has been put on hold while the cases are being argued			2
the television networks say their scripted shows no longer air nudity , racy images or expletives , even after 10 p.m. , when some potentially vulgar words are permitted			0
they worry , however , about unplanned , often spontaneous indecent or profane incidents at live events , such as awards shows and sporting events			0
@entity221 officials say such programs are often on a five - second delay , and censors are on hand to bleep any offensive language			0
but some indecent words can slip through , they admit , and they want to be protected from heavy government fines			0
winter , in a @entity1 interview , noted that @entity16 edited the f - word into a recent episode of " @entity235 , " a taped reality show , which he said had to go through multiple reviews , by multiple people in the media organization			0
the " wardrobe malfunction " case is @entity21 v. @entity243 ( 11 - 1240 ) .			1

the @entity14 administration wants the @entity7 to rule on @entity21 fines
an appeals court last year said the agency 's sanctions were improper
family advocacy groups have blasted the appeals court 's opinion
the @entity7 will decide later this year whether to accept the case
