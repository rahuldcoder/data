@entity0 -- when @entity3 released the first @entity4 nearly a decade ago , analysts considered the then - money - losing endeavor to be a sort of @entity7 into the living room : a bid to become the home 's central media hub			1
now , @entity3 is facing an undisguised assault from @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and start - ups like @entity17 and @entity18			1
they are all vying to fill the holes in internet video on the big screen with hardware that makes it easy to watch on demand			1
@entity3 and @entity25 , which makes the @entity26 , are working to bolster their internet - video offerings before new challengers can usurp the home - entertainment market that they 've been cultivating for many years with their systems			1
@entity25 plans to unwrap a new version of its video - download service for the @entity26 on tuesday			1
people who subscribe to @entity34 will be able to download a preview , and starting on october 11 , all owners of the game console will be able to download the application from the home screen in the same way they can get @entity41			1
the sleeker @entity42 has large text and cover artwork for movies and television shows			0
the overall design looks a lot like the @entity50 style @entity3 is using in @entity51 and @entity52			1
@entity42 will deploy a new patented search interface that works well with the arrow buttons on remote controls , which typically do n't have keyboards , and the system suggests results as the user types -- much like @entity14 's predictive search results			0
while surfing through menus , the app frequently makes recommendations about similar films and programs			0
" we want you to be able to search and browse in a nonlinear way , " @entity66 , a vice president for @entity67 , said in an interview			0
" we want people to get lost in the experience			0
" the company is rebranding its @entity76 media suite , which includes a music - subscription service and the video store			1
music unlimited and @entity42 will live under the @entity81 umbrella , and they may eventually be joined by the @entity82 , @entity66 said			2
for now , the @entity83 will continue to offer the same programming that @entity42 has , to cater to customers familiar with buying media through the existing store			0
@entity76 and the @entity83 will be redesigned later , @entity66 said			0
the music service has about 750,000 active users , and about 100,000 paying for access , he said			0
couch potatoes expect programs to start immediately , but @entity42 's a-la - carte downloads do n't do that currently on the @entity26			1
this already works on @entity25 's blu - ray players that have the app installed , and will be coming soon to the @entity98 , @entity66 said			1
the redesigned video service will be coming to @entity25 set - top boxes and @entity101 in the next few months , @entity66 said			1
the @entity25 tablet , which is set to debut early next month , will have a version of @entity42 , and the @entity105 app will eventually include the ability to watch videos offline , he said			1
with the new web services , @entity25 is hoping to leave behind the blunders from earlier this year which resulted in a lengthy outage for its network			1
a reminder of those flared up recently when @entity25 asked its users to waive their rights to file class - action lawsuits			2
in the interview , @entity66 boasted that @entity25 has added 3 million accounts and usage has increased by more than 10 % since the outage			2
but @entity25 's network division has more than its own recent mistakes to concern itself over			2
@entity14 has been unwavering in developing its @entity123 platform , which @entity25 installs on a few of its products			2
some rumblings within supply chains suggest that @entity13 is working on a television set			0
@entity15 is pushing its smart tv system			0
even with more tv sets bundling internet capabilities , the market for set - top boxes is expected to grow 14 % this year to 21 million devices shipped , according to market research firm in - @entity136 @entity3 , like @entity25 , feels the heat and continues to push the @entity4 beyond gaming			1
" your xbox is becoming the hub of your living room , " @entity3 ceo @entity139 said at a conference in january			2
" it is your gaming system ; it is your movies ; it is your tv experience			0
" @entity139 expanded on this concept in a presentation at the company 's developers conference last month			0
@entity3 plans to launch new video - on - demand and live tv services for @entity4 in partnership with dozens of media companies , he said			1
there is already an @entity160 channel for @entity162 subscribers			0
while @entity25 is optimizing its platform for existing remotes with the unique search feature , @entity3 is promoting the @entity166 , with its microphone and camera for motion sensing , as the peripheral for navigating video content			1
@entity3 declined to make an executive available to be interviewed			2
" certainly we all know the frustrations of using guides and menus and controllers , and we think a better way to do all of this is simply to bring @entity179 and voice to @entity4 , " @entity139 said last month			2
" you say it ; @entity4 finds it			2
" with @entity184 and @entity4 's limited video programs , @entity3 has favored subscription models			1
it 's unclear how the new xbox services will be packaged			0
@entity189 has been testing the waters on @entity192 media delivery through its 3ds hand - held			0
the @entity193 is not seen as a media hub , though it can access @entity41			0
@entity41 has about 24 million subscribers , and the game consoles have been a primary way people get the service			1
@entity25 favors a la carte over " the @entity41 model , " @entity66 said , because it can offer new films close to when they are released on blu - ray			2
" if you want to do subscriptions , you ca n't have new content , " he said			0
@entity25 is considering offering a subscription service catering to young men , which would include anime films , @entity66 said			1
" @entity98 has such a strong tie to the gamer market , " he said			0
subscriptions are thriving , evidenced by @entity41 's success and by @entity215 's partnership with @entity216 , announced monday , for the @entity218 service			0
@entity3 and @entity25 would like to sell the media , not just the hardware that plays them			1
but if their gaming consoles were truly home - entertainment @entity7 horses , the clock is ticking for them to spring their surprise .			0
