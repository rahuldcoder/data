-- @entity3 workers and activists who refused to leave the @entity6 building sunday , against orders , will be allowed to spend the night , police said			1
authorities had set a deadline earlier in the day of 4 p.m. cst for demonstrators to leave the building , saying it needed to be cleaned after roughly two weeks of protests			1
while many people left , hundreds of others defied the order and remained inside			2
some say they are willing to risk arrest in a conflict that has become a flash point in the nation 's debate around labor unions " we have the right to be here			0
this is the people 's house			0
this is a house of labor			0
this is a house that @entity31 built , " @entity29 , president of the @entity30 of @entity31 , said from inside the @entity6			1
protesters are upset with @entity31 governor @entity36 's call to curb collective bargaining rights			1
the embattled first - term @entity38 has shown no sign of backing down and defended his proposal sunday on @entity42 's " @entity41			0
" @entity31 is " broke , " and unions use their power to block necessary cost - saving measures , @entity36 argued			1
" it 's about time somebody stood up and told the truth in this state , and said , ' here 's our problem , here 's the solution , ' and acted on it , " he said			0
" because if we do n't , we fail to make a commitment to the future			2
" minutes later on the program , @entity59 president @entity58 assailed @entity36			1
" this is n't about the budget crisis , " @entity58 said , adding that @entity36 's arguments have " migrated " as his justifications have been refuted			1
" governors that are willing to sit down and work with their employees can work out problems , " @entity58 said			0
" we can solve them			0
but that 's not what governor @entity36 is doing			1
he says , ' i wo n't talk to you			2
' " @entity36 will talk to big contributors , but he " wo n't talk to employees , " @entity58 added			1
earlier on @entity0 , another union head also accused the governor of using financial arguments as a deceit			1
" @entity36 is saying it 's a budget crisis when it is n't a budget crisis , " said @entity81 , president of the @entity82			1
" the workers have already said publicly , because he refuses to meet with them , that they would take the cuts to take - home pay that he has asked for here			0
so this is a ruse to shift power to his friends , because at the same time what he said was that he wanted to give tax breaks to the friends who put him into power			0
" the @entity97 has passed a @entity38 bill that would strip most state workers of the bulk of their collective - bargaining rights			1
among other things , the measure would require workers -- with the exception of police and firefighters -- to cover more of their health care premiums and pension contributions			2
collective bargaining would be limited to wages , though any pay increases beyond the inflation rate would be subject to voter approval			0
the bill must now clear the @entity116			2
however , 14 @entity118 senators have fled to neighboring @entity119 to prevent a quorum from voting on the issue			0
@entity36 called on the lawmakers to " come back and do their job			1
" " if we fail to pass this bill by tuesday , we lose $ 165 million worth of savings			2
if we continue down that path we start seeing layoffs , " he warned			2
@entity36 repeatedly cited his experience as a local official in explaining his call to curtail bargaining rights for government			1
as a county executive , he tried " modest " changes in pensions and health care , and tried to implement a 35 - hour work week " to avoid massive layoffs and furloughs , " @entity36 said			1
" and the unions said , ' forget it			0
' emboldened by the fact that they had collective bargaining agreements , they said , ' go ahead , literally lay off 400 or 500 people			0
' " asked why the exemption for firefighters and police , @entity36 responded the decision " boils down to public safety			1
" if any firefighters or police were to walk off the job in protest , " i ca n't afford to have a fire or crime committed where there 's a gap in service			1
" @entity36 also defended himself against attacks stemming from a prank call in which he thought he was speaking privately to a wealthy conservative activist			1
the caller was in fact liberal blogger @entity165 , who posted the call online			0
at one point in the call , @entity36 said , " this is our time to change the course of history			1
" critics say his comment is a sign that he is an ideologue looking to reshape the system and end collective bargaining power rather than a pragmatic governor looking to balance a budget			1
" i do believe that			0
this is our moment in @entity31 's history , " @entity36 told @entity42			1
he added that " legislatures before have kicked the can " by not providing long - term fixes			0
" i make no apology for the fact this is an important moment in time , " he said			0
in the prank call , @entity165 suggested " planting some troublemakers " among people protesting the measure in @entity194			0
" we thought about that , " @entity36 replied in the call			2
asked sunday whether he had really thought about such an idea , he responded , " we rejected that			0
" government officials looked at " all sorts " of suggestions , and rejected that idea " because we 've had a civil discourse , " he said			0
@entity81 , speaking to @entity0 , said workers in @entity31 have sent a message to @entity36 that " ' we understand and we will do our fair share			2
' " but @entity36 is sending a different message , @entity81 said : " ' i 'm just taking away your voice at work			2
' " in the long term , that message " is ridiculous because collective bargaining is the way to increase quality , " she said			0
when president @entity218 was campaigning in 2007 , he made a promise : " if @entity221 workers are being denied their right to organize and collectively bargain when i 'm in the @entity223 , i 'll put on a comfortable pair of shoes myself			2
i 'll walk with you on the picket line as @entity231 because workers deserve to know that somebody is standing in their corner , " he said during a speech in @entity227 , @entity228 , on november 3 , 2007			0
while the president has publicly expressed support for those fighting to keep collective bargaining in @entity31 , he has not joined them at protests			0
but @entity58 of the @entity59 insisted that @entity218 , who faces federal budget challenges , is " doing it the right way			1
" " he 's not taking on workers like @entity36 is and trying to take away their ability to come together and negotiate a middle - class way of life , " @entity58 said .			2
