@entity0 -- a top judicial nominee of president @entity3 's was denied a final confirmation vote on the @entity6 floor wednesday after @entity7 expressed concern that she would be an " activist " on the bench			1
@entity11 attorney @entity10 is one of two nominees named in january by @entity3 to the @entity13 , seen by many as a professional stepping stone to the @entity16			1
a 51 - 41 cloture vote failed to achieve the necessary 60 senators to end debate on @entity10 's qualifications , with @entity21 complaining she was being unfairly filibustered			1
her third nomination to this judicial seat remains in political limbo			0
the president said he was " deeply disappointed " about the outcome			0
@entity10 is general counsel for the @entity27			2
she would fill the seat vacated by @entity29 , who joined the high court in 2005 and is now chief justice			0
" rather than debate the merits of her nomination and whether she has the legal ability , judgment , character , ethics and temperament to serve on the court , @entity6 @entity7 resorted to smearing her distinguished record of service , " said sen. @entity32 , @entity33 , chairman of the @entity34			1
" they have not been fair to this fine woman			0
" but @entity6 conservatives said @entity10 met the " extraordinary circumstances " justifying a delay in a confirmation vote			2
" ms. @entity10 has a well - documented record of advocating extreme positions on constitutional issues , pushing legal arguments beyond what i think is reasonable , including in cases involving @entity60 gun rights , abortion , the death penalty and others , " said sen. @entity50 , @entity51 , who 's also on the @entity34			1
" her attempts to distance herself from her record were simply unconvincing			0
there is no question where she stands on these issues			0
she herself has said that the ' courts are the special friend of liberty ... the dynamics of our rule of law enables enviable social progress and mobility			0
' " @entity3 is the only president in recent memory never to have successfully placed a nominee on the @entity13 , which handles many high - profile appeals , including executive authority to fight terrorism and broader congressional power			1
there are four vacancies on that bench , and much of the debate on @entity10 was whether the court 's caseload was enough to justify filling the bench with more judges			1
" as measured by the @entity21 ' own standards and their own prior actions , now is not the time to confirm another judge to the @entity13 , " said sen. @entity93 , @entity94			0
" and it is certainly not the time to consider such a controversial nominee for that important court			0
" besides @entity29 , justices @entity102 , @entity104 and @entity105 served on the @entity13 before assuming their current jobs			0
judges @entity107 and @entity108 also served there , but their 1987 nominations by president @entity112 to the high court did not succeed			2
in a rare move , @entity6 @entity7 voted in december 2011 to block @entity10 the first time she was tapped for the appeals court , complaining that the 46 - year - old @entity118 native was too liberal and would bring her " extreme " political views to the bench			1
@entity121 leader @entity121 on wednesday reiterated the view of many of his colleagues that @entity10 met the " extraordinary circumstances " standard , under a 2005 @entity6 agreement that allowed filibusters of judicial nominees only in extreme cases			1
@entity131 complained about @entity10 's legal positions on gun rights , detainee rights and immigration , and said she would bring an activist agenda to the court			1
but @entity3 said his choices were being held to a different standard			2
" today 's vote continues the @entity7 pattern of obstruction			1
my judicial nominees wait more than three times as long on the @entity6 floor to receive a vote than my predecessor 's nominees , " he said in a statement			1
" until last month , for more than forty years , the court has always had at least eight active judges and as many as twelve			0
a majority of the @entity6 agrees that ms. @entity10 is exactly the kind of person who should serve on this court , and i urge @entity6 @entity7 to allow the @entity6 to express its will and to confirm ms. @entity10 without further delay			1
" as a @entity160 senator , @entity3 joined the unsuccessful 2006 @entity162 - led filibuster of @entity163 to join the @entity16			1
that effort failed , and @entity163 has since carved a consistent conservative record in the court			2
@entity21 had defended @entity10 as a " superbly qualified nominee , " in the words of @entity32			1
sen. @entity168 , @entity169 - @entity11 , who along with colleague sen. @entity170 spearheaded the nomination , called her a " moderate " and said @entity7 have distorted her record			1
also renominated for the @entity13 is @entity173 , the principal deputy solicitor general at the @entity174 , who has argued more than 20 cases before the @entity16			0
he would be the appeals court 's first @entity176 , if confirmed			1
unlike @entity10 , @entity173 has not even had a committee vote , the procedural first step to getting final floor confirmation			2
@entity3 had nominated 33 people to the federal bench in january , including @entity10 , saying at the time that many had waited more than six months for a vote			1
" i urge the @entity6 to consider and confirm these nominees without delay , so all @entity160 can have equal and timely access to justice , " the president said			2
on tuesday , @entity192 press secretary @entity191 expressed frustration about the confirmation process , particularly involving @entity10			2
" when republicans filibustered her nomination in 2011 , several of them hung their objections not on her qualifications or her judicial philosophy , but on the @entity13 workload			0
in essence , they did n't object to her as a judge , just that the seat did not need to be filled			0
but since then , there has been an additional vacancy , " with 188 pending cases at the court			0
republicans were criticized for delaying floor votes on many nominees in the president 's first term in office			2
but the @entity192 , too , has come under fire for not moving quickly to fill growing bench vacancies			0
some moderates from both parties have long lamented threats of delays and filibuster attempts of most presidential appointments			0
they say ongoing unfilled vacancies have created a crisis in many federal courts , with bulging dockets being handled by too few judges .			0
