@entity0 was born in @entity2 , in what 's now the @entity4			1
it took root among people like the @entity8 , who flourished in ancient @entity9			2
it soon found a home in places like modern - day @entity13			2
in other words , @entity0 traces its past squarely to the @entity17			1
but do @entity18 have a future there ? recent headlines provide ample evidence for skepticism			1
it 's hard to ignore the depravity of @entity26 beheading 21 @entity27 @entity18 on a beach in @entity29			2
nor can one shake off stories of women and children among the 262 christians captured by @entity26 in @entity34 , one of several horrors faced by @entity18 in that nation and neighboring @entity38			2
they 're not just feeling the heat from @entity42 extremists : just this week , police in @entity44 said they suspected radical right - wing @entity45 were to blame for defacing a @entity48 seminary in @entity44 with slurs maligning @entity50			1
all this strain , all this chaos has shrunk the percentage of the @entity17 's once - sizable population of openly practicing @entity18			1
while no one is saying what 's happening -- especially given the savagery of @entity26 -- is n't alarming , that does n't make it surprising			2
the @entity17 has changed a lot since the first millennium @entity61 for @entity18			1
it has also changed a lot over the past century : the percentage of @entity18 relative to the @entity17 's overall population has gone from 13.6 % in 1910 to 4.2 % in 2010 , and it 's expected to drop even further , according to religious demographers @entity68 and @entity69			1
" what we 're seeing right now , " said @entity71 historical theologian @entity70 , " is the latest phase of something that has been going for 100 years , pretty much			2
" this is n't to say @entity0 itself is dying out			1
it is growing in places like @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and -- believe it or not -- some of the most dogmatic , restrictive nations in the @entity17			1
this is thanks to migrants who travel from places like the @entity88 and @entity80 to oil - rich countries where @entity42 is a state - sponsored faith			2
according to the @entity94 , places like @entity92 and @entity93 have seen their @entity0 ranks surge from basically nothing a century ago to 10 % and 13 % of their respective populations			1
some of these countries are relatively permissive			2
the @entity100 lets @entity18 do most everything but evangelize , for example , and @entity93 has top @entity0 and @entity104 officials			1
on the other end of the spectrum is @entity107 , which does n't allow the practice of anything but @entity42			1
religious police in @entity107 try to make sure that 's the case			1
@entity112 , whose nonprofit group @entity113 helps persecuted @entity18 in more than 60 countries , calls @entity107 's control on religious matters " complete			1
" " you 're not allowed to go to church , you 're not allowed to have a @entity119 , you 're not allowed to think for yourself , " @entity112 said			2
yet that has n't stopped @entity18 from coming for a simple reason : jobs			2
they 'll likely keep coming , with the @entity94 projecting @entity107 will have more than 1.5 million @entity18 by 2025			1
and they do n't necessarily stop believing and professing their faith once they cross the border			2
" there are home churches ( where people are ) practicing their faith in private , " says @entity69 , who helps manage the database and is assistant director of the @entity127			2
" ... some of them come as guest workers , but they see themselves as missionaries			1
" still , such migrant workers are in the shadows and under threat of deportation , and more , if caught praying openly or communally			1
they have n't been in the @entity17 long , and there 's no guarantee any one of them will stay long , either			1
that 's in contrast to other @entity0 communities that have been in the @entity17 for centuries			1
they 're people like @entity8 , whose ancestors were part a cradle of modern civilization			2
they began converting to @entity0 within years of @entity50 ' death and have kept the faith despite the growth of @entity42 in their homeland and , most shockingly , the @entity8 genocide of the 1910s and early 1920s			1
now those @entity8 in @entity38 and @entity34 are under fire again			0
last august , @entity26 militants overran @entity160 , a historic @entity8 community of about 50,000 people and @entity38 's largest @entity0 city			1
and in recent days , the terrorist group stormed @entity8 villages in northeastern @entity34 , taking some 262 people hostage , said @entity168 founder @entity167			2
others fled for their lives , including about 600 taking refuge in @entity172 in @entity173 , @entity34			0
" we pray , we pray all the time , " @entity174 , who has 12 relatives thought to be among those kidnapped , told @entity1 affiliate @entity177			0
" what we 've heard is it was like a sea of black uniforms marching through all the villages , burning down the churches , desecrating the crosses and wreaking havoc			0
" @entity26 has targeted other @entity18 in the region as well , like those in @entity188 , @entity38 , who were told last july to convert to @entity42 , pay a fine or face " death by sword			0
" @entity112 calls @entity26 ' actions against @entity18 " genocide			0
" yet it should n't obscure the fact that , even before this group 's emergence , the number of @entity38 @entity18 was on the decline			0
some of that 's due to a weak @entity38 central government and general instability			0
christians might also be hurt by their historic affiliation with the @entity204 , once led by deposed @entity205 ( with the @entity34 branch led by embattled president @entity207 )			0
another factor is the rise of militias and politicians who make @entity42 more central to their missions , to the exclusion of others			0
@entity112 , from @entity113 , said @entity38 had about 1.5 million @entity18 just over a decade ago			0
that number is now under 150,000 , something that he attributes to family influences , government actions , communal pressure and targeted violence from militant groups			0
" in 10 years from now , " @entity70 added , " i expect @entity18 in @entity38 will be gone			0
" a @entity224 report released this week found that , in 2013 , that @entity18 faced harassment in 102 countries			0
@entity227 got similar treatment in 99 nations , and @entity104 faced harassment in 77 , a seven - year high			0
five of the 18 countries with " very high government restrictions on religion " were in the @entity17 , according to the same study			1
that means that groups like @entity18 have a tough time in that region , but it 's not the only place nor are they the only ones persecuted			0
and there is n't anything novel about people of one faith being pitted against another			0
still , even when strife involves people from different religions , that does n't mean the discord is all about faith			0
it can also be about power , with leaders using religion in part to curry popular support and lure recruits			0
@entity70 notes a " combination of religious hatred and organized crime " is particularly dangerous , as when hostages are held for ransom or " tax " revenues are solicited from minorities			0
when this happens , any " other " group -- christians included -- can become a target			0
@entity26 and its leader , @entity273 , are prime examples			0
religion for them is almost a means to an end , as a way to create a sense of superiority , rationalize violence and spawn an " us vs. them " mentality while reaping rewards and amassing territory , said @entity287 , the founder of @entity289 's @entity288			0
" you appeal to religion both to legitimize what you 're doing and to mobilize people , " @entity290 said			0
so what can be done about @entity18 ' plight in the @entity17 ? some of it likely ca n't be helped , according to @entity69			1
with or without @entity26 , their number will continue to fall -- something the @entity300 - based religious demographer asserts is " not very unusual in the history of @entity0			1
" " @entity0 has a serial nature : it goes in an area and it thrives , then it ( declines ) , " @entity69 said			1
" it thrived in the @entity17 for a very long time			1
" according to @entity290 , one key to slowing this drop or , at least , to making life easier for those @entity18 who want to be in the @entity17 is changing the @entity42 world			1
a vast majority of @entity227 denounce extremists like @entity26 , but there are still enough who join such groups because they 're angry at their government or others and do not feel they have any better outlet or purpose			0
when that happens , it 's bad for @entity18			0
" to prevent the recruits , you have to get at the root causes , " said @entity290 , a former consultant to @entity321 and other governments			0
" and even if you wipe out @entity26 , unless those conditions change , you 're going to have other groups that emerge			0

@entity0 has long roots in the @entity17 , starting with the birth of @entity50
expert : their numbers have fallen in recent decades and should continue to fall
there are exceptions , like migrant workers *flooding* @entity338 like @entity107
