-- even though the @entity5 prize ceremony took place at @entity7 long after the sun had set , the staggering nature of @entity3 's triumph eclipsed the gloom -- and left many golf fans wondering how the visiting side had recorded the most remarkable comeback in the competition 's 85 - year history			1
trailing 10 - 4 at one point on saturday , and 10 - 6 as sunday 's singles got underway , the team led by @entity17 's @entity16 defied the odds to win a record eight - and - a - half points on the final day and thus the trophy itself			2
as darkness enveloped @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity3 's captain @entity16 talked of how the spirit of @entity29 had been key to his team 's success			1
inspirational and flamboyant , @entity29 won five major championships , revolutionized the @entity33 and revelled in the passion of a @entity5 battle with the @entity36			1
he died in 2011 after a long battle with cancer			0
" our team played in the spirit of @entity29 without ever giving up , " @entity16 said			1
for leadership and teamwork specialist @entity43 -- a man who has advised @entity44 1 champions and some of the world 's leading companies -- the spirit of @entity29 hung heavy over the @entity3 team			1
" the thing that @entity3 had -- distinct to the @entity36 -- was the notion of playing for @entity29 , and teams are often at their best when playing for an idea , " says @entity43 , whose book ' @entity51 ' will be published next month			1
" i 'm not sure the @entity36 did a lot wrong			2
but since the contest was so close , the key differentiator could be the ' @entity29 ' idea			1
after all , could the power and pulling together of the @entity36 team match his story ? " like most sports , golf is a combination of will and skill and at this level , the will is often more important than the skill			2
" the differentiator here was @entity29 had played a role in all the @entity3 players ' lives and would have meant something for many of them			1
" as @entity17 and fellow professionals , @entity16 and @entity29 shared a strong bond before the latter 's death last year			1
on the course , the @entity17 pair formed @entity3 's most dyanmaic @entity5 partnership ( with 12 points gained from their 15 matches ) and @entity16 ensured his late compatriot was never far from any of his team 's minds this week by strategically placing his image on the players ' clothing and bags			1
with @entity97 looking up to the heavens in triumph , @entity96 suggesting that @entity29 ' was with me all day ' after his win and @entity3 's star man @entity102 saying he owed his presence on the team to @entity29 , @entity16 's unorthodox approach to captaincy produced compelling results			1
the 46 - year - old may have lacked the organizational ability of previous @entity3 captain @entity110 , whose side triumphed in another nail biting clash in @entity113 two years ago , but he compensated in other areas , says @entity43			1
" compared to @entity110 , @entity16 was all about emotion -- connecting with individuals on a very visceral level , " he said			2
" @entity110 was about thorough preparation and leaving no detail unturned in an attempt to ensure the players were given the best platform to produce victory			0
" this year , people felt emotionally connected to @entity16 and his ability to translate that @entity29 factor was very powerful			1
" his organization was n't perhaps the best though , given what happened with @entity129 , " referring to the world @entity130 nearly missing his tee - off slot on sunday after confusing his time zones			0
the @entity135 eventually made it onto the course just 10 minutes before he was scheduled to start thanks to a siren - wailing police escort from the team hotel to @entity7			0
despite that glitch , @entity43 believes @entity16 built a team where belief became an intrinsic value and where his man management skills produced inspired results			1
" @entity16 did do some interesting structural things -- such as choosing @entity102 as a wild card , " says @entity43			2
" @entity102 has a brilliant @entity5 record and his infectious attitude will only ever amplify the belief in others			2
" @entity43 highlighted the way in which @entity155 put a disappointing season behind him to emerge as the effective match - winner , as the @entity158 coolly sank a pressurized putt on the 18th to beat @entity160 and ensure that @entity3 retained the @entity5			1
" teams play for a leader , " says @entity43			0
" the worst leader of @entity3 in recent times was 2008 captain @entity165 , who told @entity166 in the middle of a round that he would not be playing the next day			2
" compare that to @entity16 's management of @entity155 , who was not in great form coming into the tournament and who did n't play on the saturday either			2
" somehow , @entity16 managed to turn a potential weakness into a positive , by stressing to @entity155 that his absence on saturday was a sacrifice for the team 's greater good			0
" this would have liberated @entity155 -- and just look at the way both he and @entity160 handled the pressure in their clash late on			0
" a lot of small things combined to tip @entity3 into the belief they could win and as the scores came through , their momentum became unstoppable			0
" this momentum helped @entity155 -- and so did the @entity29 influence , as he was playing with something beyond himself			0
@entity160 saw the increasing blue on the scoreboard and began to feel the pressure			0
" it 's a fine line between that pressure either being turned into a positive or negative , but @entity160 knew everyone was relying on him -- which became pretty tough pressure -- and the game just ran away from him			0
" @entity160 's misery was compounded by the fact he was the only player among the two dozen involved who failed to win a point all week -- a statistic that history will not look kindly upon as @entity36 try to understand how they snatched defeat from the jaws of victory			0
the @entity212 is already debating this , with the newspaper pointing an accusatory finger at the decision by @entity36 captain @entity217 to select @entity160 as one of his four wild cards			2
" the better questions to ask might be how teams from @entity3 consistently pull rabbits out of their hats at these @entity224			0
@entity3 has now won two in a row , five of the past six and seven of the past nine , " the paper wrote on monday			0
" if it were just this @entity36 team that lost when on paper it seemed to have the better players , the blame might be easier to assign			0
but that 's not the case			0
" for @entity43 , the answer is simple			0
" the @entity3 were playing for each other , for their leaders and for a purpose -- @entity29			1

@entity3 staged a *stunning* *fightback* to snatch the @entity5 from @entity36 grasp
the @entity36 had seemingly built up an unassailable lead before huge *turnaround*
leadership specialist tells @entity0 *memory* of @entity29 drove @entity3 on
@entity3 captain @entity16 was close friend of late @entity249
