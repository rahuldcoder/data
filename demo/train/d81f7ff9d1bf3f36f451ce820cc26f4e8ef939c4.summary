-- far too many leaders do too much			1
does this include you ? if you ca n't take a two - week vacation without your cell phone , your laptop and your tablet , it probably does			2
do n't get me wrong -- this is not unusual			0
instead , it 's natural : our ancestors -- the ones who survived and gave us the chance to be here -- were probably more active than their sometimes less fortunate colleagues were			1
their activity was essential in the prehistoric era because it helped them overcome their inherent vulnerability and increase their chances at self - preservation			0
add to this the fact that people get promoted into leadership positions because they 've done good work -- and we all tend to repeat any action that gets rewarded -- and it 's no wonder that leaders naturally do too much			1
see also : switching off from the 24 - 7 work ethic unfortunately , this creates a serious problem : active leaders who are constantly involved in every aspect of their work come across as micro-managers			1
they do n't think of themselves this way			0
( ask yourself how many leaders willingly acknowledge that they are micro-managers ! ) but leaders ' opinions of themselves as leaders are much less important than their team members ' opinions , and proactive leaders inevitably step on their team members ' toes			1
how can a leader get around these natural tendencies ? do nothing ! or , at a minimum , do less : this will let your team members do more			1
as an experienced teacher at @entity61 , i have the opportunity to meet thousands of leaders every year in my executive courses			1
when i ask them whether they have gotten to the point of doing nothing , only about 1 % raise their hands , with a big smile on their faces			0
see also : focus on your results , not your hours at the same time , everyone else in the class looks at them with envy			0
when i ask them how they have achieved this wonderful ideal , they always say the same thing : " i have a great team			0
" this begs an important question : did they have a great team first , which allowed them to do nothing , or did they do nothing first and a great team emerged ? we do n't have enough hard data to answer this question , but is n't it intriguing to think that the latter , rather than the former , might be true ? here are a couple more rhetorical questions : do n't we know that a leader 's most important role is to lead and that team members should contribute ? and that it 's a leader 's competitive advantage to facilitate and orchestrate rather than doing anything substantive themselves ? see also : why we pick bad leaders although the answers to these questions seem obvious , too many leaders have a hard time taking the steps to implement them			1
here are a couple ways that you can move toward doing nothing and , in the process , be more effective : first , identify the breadth and range of your team members ' skills so that you can let them do what they do well			0
second , do what you can to facilitate their performance			2
think of it this way : what would your life be like if all of your team members lived up to their maximum potential ? if you now have a very rosy image in mind , why not define your job as facilitating their performance ? they will do better and your life will improve ! third , trust your people more			2
if there are good people on your team , i.e. , trustworthy people who have skills , why not trust them to do what they can do well ? people thrive on trust			2
as every professional i 've ever asked has said , when a leader trusts them more than they expected , they step up to show the leader that they were worthy of her trust			1
thus , if you work with professional people , i.e. , individuals who want to do a good job , trust them more -- odds are extremely good that they will step up and exert even more effort than they have before			1
fourth , think of yourself as a mini-ceo			0
you are the leader of your team ; you are probably their most important contact in the firm			2
when you think of yourself as a @entity162 , you should follow the first rule for a ceo : walk the floor			0
translated , this means being in touch with your team members and asking them how they are doing and how you can help make their jobs easier			0
they wo n't ask for a multi-million dollar piece of equipment and they 'll appreciate the personal attention			0
not only that , if you provide them with resources that they can use to do their jobs better , they will be motivated to do even more -- and an appreciative light will shine on you			0
see also : want be a leader ? act like one the moral of this story is simple : people love to be trusted ; they dislike micro managers ; leaders are naturally programmed to be pro-active , and this can get in the way of effective performance			1
the conclusion : give yourself a break ; trust your team members more ; and realize that you can actually achieve more by doing less yourself			2

@entity203 : leaders involved in every aspect of their work come across as micro managers
he says it 's a leader 's competitive advantage to " facilitate and orchestrate "
