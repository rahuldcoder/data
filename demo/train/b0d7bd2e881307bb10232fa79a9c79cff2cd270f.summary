-- it 's hard to believe , but tv veteran @entity2 has just snagged his very first emmy			1
@entity2 , 84 , has been nominated seven times throughout his 52 - year career , and on sunday night he finally won at the @entity6			1
he was named @entity7 for his work on @entity10 ' " @entity9			2
" he appeared as professor @entity11 , the former host of a kids ' science show , on an episode in may			0
" they wrote an awful good script , " @entity2 said of his " @entity9 " colleagues			1
" they gave me a lot of hanging curveballs and i kept swinging at them			0
" the swinging paid off			0
when he was honored on sunday with his first @entity24 statue , @entity2 humbly told reporters backstage that he " was totally unprepared for that , " according to @entity27			1
given the breadth and impact of his career -- from " the @entity31 " of the early ' 60s and ' 70s to " @entity32 " in the ' 80s and the short - lived " @entity2 " in the ' 90s -- it 's curious how @entity2 managed to go this long without a prior win			1
" the best answer to that really is whenever i was nominated , there were better people in the category than me , " the star told @entity27			0
" that 's the truth			2
that 's the way it is			2
" the @entity6 usually honor the people behind the shows in addition to talent like guest stars ahead of the televised @entity54 ceremony			0
" the great thing about ( the honor ) is that you 're voted on by your peers , and that 's very important , " @entity2 told @entity0 on sunday , moments before his big win			1
as for what 's next , @entity2 is working on reprising his " @entity9 " role this season and , if he can help it , a number of gigs after that			1
" i 'm trying to drop dead on a soundstage , " the 84 - year - old told @entity0			2
" that 's really my ultimate goal -- to just keel over in the middle of a show			0
" the 2013 @entity6 will air on september 21 at 8 p.m. pt on @entity75 , followed by the @entity76 on september 22 at 8 p.m. et on @entity10			0
