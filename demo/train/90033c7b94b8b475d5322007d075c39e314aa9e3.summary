@entity2 founder @entity4 , shown here before a congressional panel in 2007 , recently left the company			1
the sworn affidavits by an ex-marine who joined @entity2 and another employee -- listed in the documents as " @entity17 no. 1 " and " @entity18 " -- are part of a civil lawsuit in @entity21 in @entity22 against @entity4 on behalf of @entity9 families who say they lost loved ones at the hands of his company			1
@entity2 , recently renamed @entity2 , issued a statement tuesday , saying it would respond " to the anonymous unsubstantiated and offensive assertions put forward by the plaintiffs , " in a brief to be filed august 17			2
the company had a security contract for operations in @entity9 under the @entity35 until may , when the federal government declined to renew the contract			2
the decision did not affect other contracts @entity2 has with the @entity35 , a senior state department official told @entity0 earlier this year			0
several of the plaintiffs are connected to a september 2007 shooting incident in @entity44 in which the @entity9 government says security guards , then employed by @entity2 , fired upon and killed 17 @entity9 civilians			2
the affidavits by the two witnesses , who did not want to be identified in the court documents filed monday for fear of retaliatory " violence , " paint a menacing portrait of @entity4 , who recently resigned from his company			1
" first , he views himself as a @entity56 crusader tasked with eliminating @entity57 and the @entity59 faith from the globe			1
... second , mr. @entity4 is motivated by greed , " says @entity17 no. 2			1
" he sought every opportunity to deploy men to @entity9 in order to earn more money from the @entity67 government			2
" he refers to another incident when he " first arrived in @entity44 " in which he saw fellow employees pulling weapons out of a shipment of dog food -- the allegation being smuggling			0
@entity17 no. 1 describes witnessing one incident in @entity77 , where a @entity2 employee allegedly fired into a passing single - passenger vehicle without provocation			1
he says he 's heard of similar instances of excessive or deadly force from other @entity2 employees			0
however , neither gives clear details about the incidents they describe , such as specific dates or locations			0
the court documents filed tuesday are in response to a defense motion to dismiss the suit			0
the suit says the affidavits were also submitted to the @entity95 , which is engaged in an ongoing investigation into the @entity2 case			0
no criminal charges have been filed against @entity4			0
" it is obvious that plaintiffs have chosen to slander mr. @entity4 rather than raise legal arguments or actual facts that will be considered by a court of law			1
we are happy to engage them there , " the company statement said			1
" we question the judgment of anyone who relies upon and [ reiterates ] anonymous declarations			0
" earlier this year , five former @entity2 security guards pleaded not guilty to federal charges of manslaughter and other serious crimes stemming from a september 16 , 2007 , shooting			0
