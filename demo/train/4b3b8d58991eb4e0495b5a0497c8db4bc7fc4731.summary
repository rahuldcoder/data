one would expect that the @entity2 @entity1 has the best interests of the public in mind , but its recent decisions have cast serious doubt upon this assumption			1
one in particular could have a dramatic impact on the safety of the @entity2 food supply : it is the mandate of the @entity1 to regulate the use of agricultural chemicals like insecticides and herbicides , as well as to determine their allowable limits in food and drinking water			1
herbicides ( weed killers ) are mixtures of chemicals designed to spray on weeds , where they get inside the plants and inhibit enzymes required for the plant to live			2
the active ingredient in the most widely used herbicide is glyphosate , while some herbicides contain @entity34			1
@entity34 is best known as a component of @entity36 , a defoliant widely employed during the @entity38			0
until the introduction of @entity42 crops about 20 years ago , herbicides were sprayed on fields before planting , and then only sparingly used around crops			1
the food that we ate from the plants was free of these chemicals			0
in stark contrast , with herbicide resistant @entity42 plants , the herbicides and a mixture of other chemicals ( surfactants ) required to get the active ingredient into the plant are sprayed directly on the crops and are then taken up into the plant			1
the surrounding weeds are killed while the @entity42 plant is engineered to resist the herbicide			0
therefore , the food crop itself contains the herbicide as well as a mixture of surfactants			1
to accommodate the fact that weeds are becoming glyphosate resistant , thereby requiring more herbicide use , the @entity1 has steadily increased its allowable concentration limit in food , and has essentially ignored our exposure to the other chemicals that are in its commercial formulation			1
as a result , the amount of glyphosate - based herbicide introduced into our foods has increased enormously since the introduction of @entity42 crops			1
multiple studies have shown that glyphosate - based herbicides are toxic and likely public health hazards			2
of equal importance in terms of health is the fact that herbicides are now being used to rapidly kill @entity94 grain crops at the end of their growing season in order to speed up harvesting			1
so , a product can be labeled @entity42 - free but still contain high levels of herbicide			0
the fact that agricultural chemicals are now inside the food crops that we eat is a fundamental shift in both our food production system and human exposure to toxic chemicals			2
unfortunately , it is about to get even worse			0
since @entity34 has been used for over 50 years , its toxicity to farm workers and neighboring populations is well documented			0
@entity1 sponsored studies have shown that those repeatedly exposed to @entity34 have an increased risk of @entity119 , cancer and birth defects			1
its nonagricultural use is banned in some @entity125 countries			0
despite this information , and warnings from many knowledgeable organizations , scientists and doctors , the @entity1 has recently concluded that the commercialization of corn and soy genetically modified to be resistant to both @entity34 and glyphosate will have no adverse effects on human health and has allowed the introduction of these crops in many states			1
the summary statements used to justify this decision are on the @entity1 website , but the scientific data and discussion to support it are not available to the public			2
some predict that because of these @entity42 crops and the inevitable increase in weed herbicide resistance , the amount of @entity34 entering our environment could soon increase up to 30 fold over the 2010 levels			2
as a medical research scientist , i consider this @entity1 allowance a grave error and believe that it will ultimately lead to a public health disaster			1
this conclusion is based upon the following considerations : 1 ) @entity34 , glyphosate , and surfactants are inside the plant and can not be washed off			0
recently shipments of soybeans to @entity168 have contained 50-fold the amount of glyphosate allowed in @entity125 , and high levels are in @entity2 @entity42 soybeans while none is detected in conventional and organic beans			0
2 ) @entity34 is toxic , and safety testing of glyphosate formulations has shown that they are endocrine disrupters and cause liver and kidney damage			0
moreover , it appears that the specific formulation of @entity34 and glyphosate that will be applied to the new @entity42 crops has not been tested for health safety			2
because soy - and corn - based foods will contain these chemicals , they should be considered food additives and fall under the jurisdiction of the @entity188 , which would require extensive safety testing			0
3 ) @entity191 and @entity34 accumulate in the environment , and the amounts will increase in our food and drinking water as their combined use becomes widespread and weeds become more resistant			2
glyphosate is already found in the blood and urine of people , and in a soy rich nutrient mix given to infants			0
4 ) while the producers of the new , doubly herbicide resistant crops and the @entity2 regulatory agencies have some control over the production and use of herbicides in this country , they can not control those made or used abroad			1
the relatively uncontrolled use of glyphoshate - based herbicides in @entity218 and @entity219 has lead to significant increases in birth defects , kidney toxicity , and cancer			0
it will be much worse if @entity34 is thrown into the mix. what does this all mean ? consumers should consider purchasing certified organic soy and corn products until the @entity1 withdraws its allowance of food crops that contain herbicides , and every effort should be made to prevent the introduction of additional herbicide resistant crops			1
these food additives are not good for you or your children .			0

@entity1 has steadily increased the allowable concentration limit of herbicides in food supply
@entity245 : herbicide resistant crops present health risks for consumers that can not be ignored
