-- as a society , it seems we 'll always struggle with our vices			0
our governments are less morally conflicted , it seems			0
whether it 's outlawing drugs , prostitution , even alcohol prohibition , making vices illegal is problematic because it 's illogical			2
vices are personal choices made that harm one 's own body or property			2
crimes , on the other hand , are wrongs committed against another person , or society as a whole — by definition , damaging another person 's body or property			2
it has often been said that vice crimes are " victimless , " because each one of them involves a deliberate choice to inject , fornicate , snort or swill to the detriment of one person : the person with the bad habit			0
of course , supporters of vice prosecution argue that the individual 's addiction or bad decisions always have an indirect collateral effect on society as a whole : drugs and prostitution ruin neighborhoods , while booze and cigarettes impose a health care cost borne by all of us			2
and then there 's gambling			1
on october 6 , a federal district court judge will entertain @entity53 gov. @entity52 's request to permit legal sports betting in the @entity53			1
as it stands , a federal court of appeals has struck down a @entity53 law repealing a sports betting ban			1
the court held the state law conflicted with federal law , called @entity62 , which prohibits engaging in a sports gambling scheme " pursuant to state law			1
" which means -- and this is confusing -- sports betting may be legal in @entity53			1
confused ? you should be			0
here 's what happened : @entity53 passed a 2012 state law legalizing sports betting in the state			1
that was challenged by the @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , and the federal government in federal court			1
the court voided the @entity53 law , finding it was pre-empted by the federal law			1
basically , if a state law conflicts with a federal law , and the federal exercise of power in that area is valid , the state law loses			2
so , the @entity53 law allowing sports wagering was struck down , except that the court observed that the federal law banned a state from " licensing " or " sponsoring " sports gambling			1
that is apparently different than banning a state from making sports gambling legal			1
by this logic , @entity53 could pass a law making sports betting legal in a casino , so long as the state had no part in regulating it			1
the @entity53 attorney general 's office has since directed law enforcement to refrain from prosecuting casinos and racetracks for running sports - wagering pools			1
the federal government and an association of sports leagues are opposing this move to legalize sports betting			1
these benevolent entities have every interest in preventing the moral scourge and corrosive addiction that is gambling			2
it 's all about money			2
after all , state - sponsored gambling is already an entrenched part of our society in the form of the lottery			2
it 's the ultimate hypocrisy to suggest that there 's something evil about putting 50 bucks on the @entity130 to cover the spread : a close to 50/50 wager			2
meanwhile , if you would like to buy a lottery ticket , those odds on the @entity135 are about a bajillion - to - one			0
but the government is happy to take your money on that bet			2
make no mistake , the only reason lotteries are legal is because the government gets to wet its beak			0
as long as the state offers some flimsy pretext about the money going to schools or senior citizens , we the people are placated			0
that means you and i will continue to get stuck in line at the @entity158 , behind some delusional nudnik spending money he does n't have on a handful of scratchers , or calling out his " lucky " numbers to the clerk			0
@entity165 , you 're in your pajama pants and slippers , out in public , at noon on a weekday : your " lucky numbers " are anything but " lucky			0
" time for some new lucky numbers , and a job			0
placing a bet with your bookie at the bar is outlawed , but not because it 's intrinsically immoral			0
it 's illegal only because the government is not taxing it , and because the pro sports leagues are not getting a cut of the action			1
believe me , if @entity184 figures out a way to fit prostitutes with one of those @entity189 credit card readers for the @entity190 to automatically deduct sales taxes and @entity192 , well , just get ready for the @entity194 app is all i 'm saying			0
the nice thing about vices is that as they become more widespread , popular acceptance eventually overrides the law			0
@entity200 did n't work because we did n't accept it			0
marijuana has become legal over time by slowly gaining ground , until users — and states — openly flouted federal criminal law			0
what a surprise : in states where it is now legal it is taxed and regulated			0
sports wagering is probably next			0
@entity76 commissioner @entity212 has conceded what the rest of us have known for a long time : legal sports gambling is inevitable			1
the sooner the leagues figure out an infrastructure that siphons revenue from @entity221 's nasty penchant for blowing his pension check on the ponies , sports betting will magically become ok with pro sports			1
do n't believe me ? fantasy sports — gambling havens of their own — are legal , and now an industry			2
the @entity230 of 2006 makes an exception for any fantasy sports game with an outcome that reflects the relative knowledge of the participants ( but not chance )			0
that sounds a lot like betting on games — but then again , who are we to question the wisdom of @entity243 ? the pro teams and leagues must be furious , right ? well , actually no. the @entity75 , for example , runs its own fantasy leagues , and licensed use of any @entity75 products is an additional revenue stream			0
and , of course , fantasy activities increase viewership ; instead of watching only your team on sunday , you 're going to watch every game and commercial featuring your fantasy players			0
another way the @entity75 benefits massively from fantasy sports			0
here 's the fascinating part about the @entity53 case : the federal court of appeals held that the state could not sponsor or license sports gambling			1
that put @entity52 in a bit of a pickle : is there any point in legalizing sports wagering if the state does n't get a piece of the pie ? that question might have been answered in the negative , if @entity279 had not suffered big declines in the profits of casino businesses in 2013			1
it 's in @entity52 's interest -- and that of @entity53 -- to revive the casino industry			1
so then , can sports betting become morally and legally acceptable in @entity53 , where the government is prohibited from licensing or sponsoring it ? traditionally , gambling has only been legal when the government can profit , but the governor and his attorney general have apparently decided that a devastating loss of jobs in @entity279 justifies forgoing money in the coffers			1
while the @entity53 has a " moral " dilemma , the leagues ' position remains the same : the 3rd @entity301 decision does n't guarantee them any profit , so they will continue to oppose sports betting as they have so far in this case			1
ultimately , do n't think for a second that the leagues , the states or the federal government care about the morality of our gambling addictions			1
when gambling is profitable to these entities and interest groups , it 's legal			2
when someone else is making the profits , it 's magically illegal			0
standing in line for the lottery in your bathrobe in the early afternoon ? still legal , but really sad .			0

@entity325 will rule on @entity52 's effort to legalize sports gambling in @entity53
@entity329 says sports leagues , federal government oppose the move
he says it 's not an *objection* on moral grounds ; the foes just want their share of money
@entity329 : for @entity53 , the *key* is to stop the loss of casino jobs
