for him , as well as many others in this small , arid country , diamonds are a source of both income and pride			2
the economy of @entity5 , a landlocked country in southern @entity30 , has been transformed by diamonds			1
since their discovery in late 1960s , the development of the country has been built on the gems buried deep in its soil			0
in 1969 , the @entity5 government signed a 50/50 deal with global diamond giant @entity40 to explore and mine all of the country 's diamonds			1
the partnership , called ' @entity45 , ' has helped turn @entity5 into one of @entity30 's most prosperous countries , boasting today a robust economy and one of the highest per capita incomes on the continent			1
the state mines the country 's riches as an owner , getting a share of the profit in addition to just collecting taxes and royalties like many other mineral - rich @entity30 governments			1
