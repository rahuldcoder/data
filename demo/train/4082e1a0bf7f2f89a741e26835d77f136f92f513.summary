@entity0 -- severely burned 3 - year - old @entity2 has experienced a level of horror and pain that would test the nerves of a soldier			1
her survival alone is miraculous and the procedure being undertaken to save her is a first of its kind in @entity12			1
doctors will get a first look at how successful that procedure might be this week , when reconstructive surgeon dr. @entity16 will carefully peel away layers of bandages around @entity20 's tiny torso			2
her ordeal began on @entity22			0
@entity20 played outside as her father , @entity23 , prepared a barbeque using a highly flammable liquid gel			0
as he lit the gel , its container exploded and covered @entity20 's small body			2
she screamed as her skin burned and " bubbled " according to her mother , @entity32			2
the toddler sustained third - degree burns on 80 % of her body			1
afterward , she was struck with four cardiac arrests , kidney failures , collapsed lungs and multiple infections			0
her critical condition eventually stabilized under the care of @entity42 and others at the @entity44 in @entity0			0
but the @entity45 were uncomfortable with their options for healing her skin : temporarily use skin from a cadaver or from a pig , or take her small portion of undamaged skin and graft it elsewhere			1
" please do n't take the perfect skin , just give me a week to find something else , " begged @entity53			2
after days on the @entity57 and hours reaching out to reconstructive specialists in the @entity59 , @entity20 's mother discovered a company in @entity61 called @entity62 whose specialty is growing layers of human skin by cloning a 2 - square - centimeter sample from a patient			1
the process , called a cultured epidermal autograft , was done more than 100 times in the @entity59 last year , according to @entity62			1
however , because the " new " skin must be administered within 24 hours of leaving the lab , it has n't been attempted much farther away -- never before in @entity12 -- and it 's not cheap			1
" the only lab is in the @entity59 , it is extremely expensive to set up with special technicians and very specialized equipment			1
it took years to get the technology there , but i think the big problem is cost , " @entity62 's dr. @entity79 said			0
he explained that in @entity20 's case , the price tag of new skin is $ 82,000			2
only through local medical coverage and generous online donations have the @entity45 been able to consider such a modern solution with no guarantee it will work			0
even when the skin does make it to the patient within 24 hours -- as it did for @entity20 last monday after a trans - @entity96 flight -- potential risks are many			1
the grafted skin could tear , and infection is possible from the trace amounts of murine cells , which come from lab rats or mice , used to aid skin growth			1
in fact , @entity42 wo n't know if @entity20 's new skin is attaching itself properly until he gently pulls back her bandages on monday and each following day			0
for @entity20 's mother , the uncertainty is worth the cost and the risk even if it offers nothing more than further hope			0
" i ca n't bear to see her like this again , " she said			0
" i know it 's for the best ... she will heal in @entity118 's perfect time			0

3 - year - old @entity2 has third - degree burns over 80 % of her body
a relatively new skin - graft procedure is being tried for the first time in @entity12
the only lab doing the procedure is in the @entity59
the new skin had to be flown *quickly* from the lab to @entity12
