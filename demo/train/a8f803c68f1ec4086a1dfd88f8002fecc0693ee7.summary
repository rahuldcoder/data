-- @entity1 had miscalculated a little bit			0
he was bringing home some furniture from @entity5 in his electric - powered truck , and there was n't enough charge to get him all the way to the house			2
about a mile from his @entity12 , @entity13 , home he decided to pull into the parking lot of an auto parts store to see if it would let him borrow an outlet			1
he reasoned that the store would have no problem with him recharging , hoping he 'd come back in the future			2
so he charged for a few minutes , getting enough juice to make it the rest of the way			2
that , said @entity1 , was the only time in his 18 months as a @entity27 owner that he was ever close to being stranded			0
" i think the added weight cost me a little bit in range , " @entity1 said by phone recently			2
" i probably could have kept going , but i was worried i would damage the batteries			0
" most of @entity1 's trips are short , and this was only one of a few times he has dealt with " range anxiety , " a new phrase popular with electric car drivers and potential buyers			1
electric vehicles generally get between 25 to 100 miles on a full " tank " whereas a gas - powered car can go 300 miles or more			1
and gas stations are everywhere ; there are more than 160,000 in the country			0
there are only a few hundred working electric charging stations			2
in @entity12 there are less than 30 , @entity1 said			1
to prevent range anxiety , @entity1 said he often will plan trips based on where he can charge the car			1
for instance , there are two nearby grocery stores			0
he goes to the one with the eight charging stations and powers up for free while shopping			0
but still he must keep his trips short			0
the good news is the city of @entity12 is on a mission to install the infrastructure to support the next coming of the mass - produced electric car			1
within the next year , @entity12 will install 500 public - use charging stations , with surrounding communities also putting in similar numbers			1
the money comes in part from the @entity75 @entity74 , which has allocated $ 400 million to electric vehicle infrastructure			1
several companies are working with cities to put in charging stations in the next year -- about 12,000 of them			2
most of them are going in western state cities where power is primarily from renewable resources and cheaper than other areas			0
for instance , in @entity13 , 69 percent of electricity is generated by hydropower			1
@entity12 mayor @entity89 said his city has learned from its experience with building one of the biggest bike networks in the country			1
" we built a system that made people comfortable with going from @entity99 , " he said , adding that bike ridership has doubled in the past 15 years			0
" the thing we know having introduced large - scale strategic changes in our transportation system here ... is you do your homework upfront , you figure out what it is , in this case that will address people 's range anxiety , and then you watch it very , very closely in the first six to 12 months , and you make the necessary changes			1
" therein lies the question or questions : how many charging stations do you need ? for how many electric cars ? do you put in thousands of public charging points , and then watch as just a few cars use them ? will people even buy electric cars if they do n't see places to get power around town ? at your house , plugging the car in overnight is not an issue			1
when you are out running errands during the day , it can become a concern , as @entity1 found out when he headed home from @entity5 that day			2
early buyers of electric vehicles are more likely to put up with the inconvenience of locating public charging , but large - scale sales will depend on the public 's comfort with always being able to get fuel			1
" the charge infrastructure is going to be something that people adapt to , " said @entity141 , an electrical engineer at the @entity142 near @entity143 , @entity144			2
" it 's like you get used to charging your cell phone battery or your laptop battery , you know when you need to plug in			2
" @entity141 added , " the key is whether you have time			0
" he said it makes sense to put chargers in where people will spend a lot of time -- offices , coffee shops , shopping centers , movie theaters			2
on the street , charging will be a different story , similar to hunting for a public bathroom			0
it depends on how badly you need it			0
home chargers should be able to fill a car 's batteries in a few hours			1
a fast charger outside a grocery store might be able to do the job in 30 minutes			1
but if all you can find is a 110 - volt outlet , getting anything more than a few miles ' worth of power will take more than half a day			0
" if the public infrastructure is out there , it makes people feel more comfortable , particularly the people who are n't very familiar with electric cars , " said @entity182 , vice president of @entity183 , a coalition of electric car advocates and drivers			1
@entity182 lives in @entity192 and has driven an electric car for eight years			1
he said he trades with hybrid - owning friends when he goes on a long trip			0
the long - trip predicament is one of the reasons @entity199 chose to make an extended - range electric vehicle			1
the volt can go 40 miles on a single charge ( about a average day 's miles for the typical @entity75 ) , and it also has a gas - powered generator that gives it the ability to drive 300 more miles , @entity199 says			0
volt drivers will still use charging stations , but it 'll be a convenience ( electricity costs less per mile ) more than a necessity			0
" that said , we feel there is going to be an awful lot of organic growth in public places , " said @entity214 , @entity215 ' director of global energy systems and infrastructure commercialization			1
" [ consumer demand ] for public charging is the right way to do it because then it says you are going to do it in just the right spots [ where people show they want to charge ]			0
" @entity199 's @entity201 : when the juice runs out determining the right spots is falling into the hands of companies that have tapped into the @entity74 millions			1
one of those is @entity235 , which manages the @entity236 , an initiative to get the electric car movement reborn			2
@entity239 , chief executive officer of @entity235 , said that besides helping local governments , utilities and consumer groups set up charging networks , the primary goals are charging station projects that connect cities such as one planned for @entity248 along the @entity249			0
" the objective is to show what 's necessary to build these major corridors , " he said			0
" what we 're doing is rolling out the largest infrastructure program for electric cars in history , but we 're also doing is , under the auspices of the @entity74 program , is we 're collecting data -- where people charge , how often they charge , so that we can have hard data to share with other communities of what the consumer is looking for and what we need to do as an industry			1
" @entity271 , makers of the @entity269 , which is scheduled to hit the roads in a few months , said the data collected from the initial rollout will be hugely beneficial to other parts of the country that will be a part of the second phase			1
" of course we 're not going to be 100 percent perfect with every decision , every location , " said @entity278 , director of product planning at @entity271			2
" so the deliverable is how do people use it ? what is the impact on the grid ? what kind of support did drivers need ? all that information will be important			0
" a closer look at @entity271 's @entity269 lessons learned from the rollout of charging stations to support the @entity296 more than a decade ago are helpful but " somewhat irrelevant , " he said because the new charging stations are much more sophisticated as are the electronics in the car			1
one of the people working on @entity303 's electric vehicles said it is vital not to repeat earlier mistakes of putting recharging spots where they were n't needed			1
" some of the most premium parking spaces were used for @entity236 charging , and there were n't the vehicles to support them , and you can imagine what the impact was for @entity318 drives , " said @entity308 , manager of global electrification at @entity303 " the answer is not only putting them in the right spot but at the right time			0
" another issue was the technology			0
@entity325 , chief executive of @entity327 electric vehicles in @entity328 , @entity329 , said those charge points were built to varying standards and that one of the huge " breakthroughs " recently was an agreement reached between car companies and makers of recharging stations over international equipment standards			1
" there 's going to be one type of socket and one type of plug , " @entity325 said			0
" before that i thought we were going to see a beta vs. @entity347 sort of thing			0
" the standard was the last big hurdle before the new electric vehicles hit the road , he said			0
@entity354 is probably the biggest player now getting involved in the manufacture of charging stations			0
tv ads for its @entity359 are already running during network primetime			0
" when someone as large as @entity354 comes into the space , you know they have done their research and they see a very big future , " said @entity278 of @entity271 , which is partnering with a company called @entity363 for home charging stations			2
while the general public may still look at the electric car as a novelty , its advocates see the coming wave of new models and stations as a big step toward eliminating this country 's use of oil , especially foreign oil , and helping the planet			1
stopping to get a charge away from home is a small price to pay , said @entity182 , the @entity183 vice president			0
" if you care about the environment , if it bothers you that you are polluting everybody 's air , if it bothers you that you are sending lots of money out of the country , " he said , " then it 's worth it to you to spend 20 minutes " recharging .			1

" range anxiety " *reflects* concern about recharging electric cars during long drives
@entity12 , @entity13 , will go from 30 public car chargers to 500 within a year
depending on the charger , juicing up can take from 20 or 30 minutes to a few hours
makers of @entity271 's @entity269 and @entity201 are closely watching infrastructure rollout
