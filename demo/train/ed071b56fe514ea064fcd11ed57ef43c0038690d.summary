-- the death of @entity2 on wednesday from a massive heart attack at age 66 elicited all the standard commentary about the @entity6 , the band that made him a star : @entity6 were a made - for - tv boy band			1
they recorded tunes written not by them , but by reputable songwriters like @entity11 ( " @entity18 " ) , @entity12 ( " @entity13 " ) , and the team of @entity15 and @entity16 ( " @entity17 " )			0
they were @entity20 knockoffs and teen idols			0
those points are all valid , but they miss two essential aspects of the @entity6 ' story			2
the first is fairly simple : despite their undoubtedly contrived origins , they turned out to be one of pop 's finest bands , arguably the most underrated in rock history			2
the second is deeper : their ongoing lack of critical respect speaks to struggles within the music world — authenticity vs. artifice , pop vs. rock — that continue to this day , more than 45 years after the launch of their short - lived sitcom			1
it 's unlikely that anyone , least of all the @entity6 themselves , thought there was anything serious about the project when their tv series debuted in fall 1966			1
@entity52 and creators @entity53 and @entity55 were in search of actors to play a fictional band modeled after the @entity20 in " @entity59 " and " help ! " after many auditions , they chose two young show biz professionals ( @entity2 , the sole @entity64 , and @entity65 ) and two folk - rockers who knew how to sing and play ( @entity67 and @entity68 )			1
from the start , the @entity6 had little control over their music and even album covers			1
sparkling early hits like " @entity18 " and " @entity74 " were written by outside tunesmiths and played by studio musicians			0
fairly soon after the show 's launch , the @entity6 , @entity68 especially , began to chafe at their artistic constraints			2
in what @entity80 called " @entity81 of ' 67 , " they demanded control over their records , and out went @entity84 , the venerable publisher who had overseen their early releases			1
this period , what we could call @entity6 2.0 , resulted in " @entity90 , " " @entity17 , " and many other songs on which the @entity6 were far more involved ( producing and playing many of the instruments themselves )			1
no matter the period or who was behind the console , the @entity6 could make magical records , as i was reminded when , by strange coincidence , i plowed through their " @entity99 " boxed set just last weekend			2
the collection 's four discs reaffirm the largely high quality of their material and multihued variety of the arrangements			0
they could do credible garage rock ( " [ @entity107 , " " words , " " she " ) , exquisite ballad - centric pop ( " sometime in the @entity111 , " " @entity110 " ) , and quasi-psychedelia ( " @entity113 , " which features one of the first appearance on record of a synthesizer )			0
songs that @entity68 wrote or sang — " @entity119 , " " @entity120 " — would n't have been out of place on more highly regarded @entity123 albums of the same ' 66 - ' 70 period			0
" for @entity129 , " the snappy " ... in this generation " song heard over the closing credits of each episode of their show , was written by @entity67			0
the @entity130 and @entity131 both covered songs made famous by the @entity6 : " @entity133 " and " @entity134 , @entity135 , " respectively			1
share your memories of @entity2 and the @entity6 @entity2 , who had proven his stage chops before the @entity6 by starring in a @entity140 production of " @entity141 ! " , was more than just their eternally cherubic , always - on singer and maracas player			1
he could caress the hits ( " @entity90 " ) , invest a song with suitable snideness ( the groupie song " @entity149 " ) and even co-write a very credible pop reverie ( " @entity151 " )			0
yet for all that musical breadth , the @entity6 still do n't quite get the credit they should , which gets to the issues of credibility that swirl around them and anything considered too @entity157			1
by the time their show launched and became an immediate hit , it was becoming de rigueur for pop and rock bands to write their own songs , to express themselves			2
@entity6 did this on later albums like " @entity166 , " but they never recovered from being seen as puppets			2
they were the right band at the wrong time , and unfairly so			0
@entity169 wrote its own material , too , but i dare anyone beyond the most devout " @entity174 " nostalgist to make it through any of their albums in 2012			0
these issues , especially in an era when indie signifies authenticity , still linger			0
whenever i tell a friend i 'm a fan of @entity182 , i receive the same puzzled , " are you serious ? " looks i used to get when i told my teenage friends that i 'd bought the @entity6 ' " @entity184 " long after they broke up			1
whatever one thinks of her wardrobe or bombastic , disappointing " @entity190 " album , @entity182 has genuine talent : she can sing , write songs and play various keyboards			1
yet something about her still makes some people squirm in the way they do n't when someone mentions an intentionally grating indie band like @entity199			0
the music is seen as too polished and produced , and therefore not credible enough			0
@entity6 may always be tarnished , and perhaps there 's a weird badge of honor in that : so disreputable that they 're reputable ! @entity2 did n't die for our integrity sins , but the @entity6 ' reputation has suffered plenty for them			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211			0

@entity211 : @entity2 ' death has *stirred* new round of *dissing* of the @entity6 as fake
he says they were underrated band ; that they get little respect raises issues *relevant* today
he says @entity6 *rebelled* against tv *handlers* , demanded control , made better songs
@entity225 : @entity182 is modern example of pop music *mistakenly* not taken seriously ;
