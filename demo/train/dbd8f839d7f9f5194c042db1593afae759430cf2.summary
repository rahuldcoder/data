there have been @entity1 since the time of , well , @entity3			0
now that two millennium - long history could be in danger			0
@entity8 thugs have attacked dozens of churches across @entity10 in the past few days , burning many of them down			1
the attacks seemed to be protests against the brutal military government crackdown on the @entity15 that killed many hundreds of @entity16 over the past week			1
pope @entity17 , the leader of @entity10 's @entity18 , met publicly with top military officers as they announced the coup that removed president @entity21 and his @entity15 government from power in early july			1
@entity24 , who make up 10 % of the population , and other minorities had complained that a new constitution that had been passed by the @entity21 government infringed on their rights			1
for some @entity8 militants , now it 's payback time			0
according to one report , 52 churches across @entity10 were attacked in 24 hours last week			1
the @entity35 has counted at least 30 churches attacked , along with other @entity18 facilities			0
after @entity21 was removed from power , a mob armed with axes hacked a @entity18 businessman to death near @entity43 in southern @entity10 and then continued their rampage in the village of @entity47 , burning dozens of @entity18 homes and killing three other @entity24			1
today there are more than 10 million @entity24 in the @entity50 and they make up an estimated 5 % of the @entity50 's population			2
a century ago they made up an estimated 20 %			0
much of this fall can be attributed to factors such as emigration and the high birth rates of many @entity56 , but some of it is also attributable to the increasing marginalization and targeting of @entity24 ; a worrying trend being seen not just in @entity10 but also in other @entity63 countries			1
many @entity64 @entity24 have tacitly supported the regime of president @entity66 , which draws much of its strength from the small @entity70 sect and therefore has historically favored and protected @entity64 's other religious minorities			1
as a result , the jihadists who have come to dominate a significant portion of the @entity64 rebel movement have supplemented their war against the government with attacks that target @entity24			1
on june 27 , a suicide bombing in a @entity18 area of @entity81 killed at least four people			0
@entity84 - affiliated rebels are suspected of killing an @entity86 priest who had spent most of his life rehabilitating a monastery north of the @entity64 capital of @entity81 and who disappeared last month			2
the rev. @entity91 had reportedly been trying to secure the release of several hostages in the custody of an @entity84 - aligned group			0
meanwhile , in march in @entity96 , @entity97 , where a militant attack on a @entity100 government complex left four @entity100 dead in september 2012 , around 60 @entity24 were rounded up by extremists and handed over to the government on suspicion of immigrating from @entity10 illegally			1
the militants tortured several of their captives , killing one of them			0
that bout of vigilantism followed the arrest in february of four @entity24 accused of proselytizing to @entity15 @entity97			1
the consequence of such attacks and harassment has been an exodus of @entity24 from the region			2
residents of northeastern @entity64 , where @entity24 have historically been concentrated , estimate that one - third of the @entity24 there have fled the country during the past two years			1
similarly in @entity119 , since the fall of @entity121 in 2003 , the @entity18 @entity119 population may have dropped by as much as 50 % , according to a @entity123 assessment			0
and despite making up only about 3 % of the @entity119 population , @entity24 accounted for half the @entity119 who fled the country in 2010 , about 200,000 people			0
@entity10 's religious tensions have a longer history than the recent clashes between @entity15 supporters and @entity24			1
although then - president @entity132 kept a tight lid on the country 's @entity8 extremists , clashes between @entity56 and @entity24 erupted sporadically throughout the ' 90s			2
but since @entity132 's fall , extremist violence against @entity24 has picked up in @entity10			1
in early october 2011 , @entity10 saw its worst instance of sectarian violence in 60 years , when two - dozen @entity24 died in clashes with the military			2
as a result of these kinds of attacks , by one estimate , around 100,000 @entity24 left @entity10 in 2011			2
this kind of homogenization has happened before in the @entity50 , which boasted a sizable @entity150 population in the ' 50s			0
but with the creation of the state of @entity155 and the rise of @entity63 nationalism and then @entity8 , the region has become more hostile to non-muslims			2
around @entity160 there were 100,000 @entity150 in @entity10 , a community that had existed in @entity10 since the time of the pharaohs			0
now , there are a handful of synagogues operating in @entity167			0
they are heavily guarded and generally empty as they cater only to the few dozen elderly @entity150 who are still left in @entity10			0
one can only hope that this is not to be the fate of the @entity1 .			0

*christians* have been targeted in @entity10 , @entity64 and @entity97
@entity175 : @entity10 's @entity24 *largely* supported the coup that *overturned* @entity21 regime
in turn , @entity24 have been attacked by @entity16 over the past week , he says
@entity175 : the region has become increasingly hostile to non-muslims
