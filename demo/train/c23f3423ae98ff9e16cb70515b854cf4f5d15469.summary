-- a few weeks ago , my 11 - year - old daughter was cut from her travel soccer team			1
two years ago this month , my son was n't accepted into the sixth - grade honors math. was i disappointed ? absolutely			2
but after initially reeling from both of these losses , i learned to embrace the failure			1
parents are hardwired to want their kids to succeed			1
it 's probably biologically rooted in our ultimate survival			1
in an earlier evolutionary period , failure was fatal			1
today , failure is not making a competitive sports team , a select program or the college of your choice			1
we are the generation of drone parents hovering above and swaddling our kids in bubble wrap so they do n't get hurt when they fall			1
in fact , we do everything possible to not let them fall			2
in an uber - competitive age where we exhaust ourselves in the pursuit of perfection for our children , even from the womb , parents have bought into the myth of how to turn out successful people			1
we are living in a world of tutors , private lessons and specialized coaching , thoroughly believing that with all the right scaffolding , we can guarantee our kids will soar			1
ironically , at a time when our parenting culture is all about ensuring success , the innovative business culture of @entity44 celebrates failure			1
@entity49 recently had a cover story called " the @entity51 of @entity44			1
" there are books , blogs and even conferences devoted to embracing the flop			0
there 's no stigma or shame			1
in fact , a failed venture is a notch in the belt , an honor of distinction , a bragging right			0
the founder of a start - up that goes belly up may even be courted to take the helm of another company			0
they turn failure into a rite of passage among the best and the brightest			1
reinvent and move on -- that 's the ethos of enterprising entrepreneurs today and perhaps that is a great lesson for parents , too			1
as the economy has shifted from an industrial to information one , experimentation is key			0
the ability to pivot , shift and keep trying is critical			0
failure is an inevitable part of that process			2
" agility is the new smart , " says @entity87 , founder of the @entity88			0
@entity91 is a trained psychologist , former chief talent officer at @entity92 and author of " leading from the edge : @entity95			0
" she is also a mother of an 11 - year - old son			0
@entity91 says that in today 's economy , the secret sauce for kids ' future success is to raise children in an environment where they are encouraged to test boundaries , engage with the world , and yes , even fail			1
" if you have n't failed , then you have n't significantly learned anything to be able to move to the next stage , " @entity91 said			2
" when kids do n't learn how to fail , it creates a neurotic energy around perfectionism			1
they get stuck in a loop around perfect and they lose that opportunity to learn from the experience			0
" failing spectacularly is probably not what we are hoping for when it comes to our vision for our children			0
personally , it 's painful to flop and watching our own kids struggle can be heartbreaking			1
two years ago , when i got the letter that my son did n't make it into the honors math class in sixth grade , not only was he crushed -- @entity131 , too , spent the summer miserable that he would not be in the coveted math class			2
but my son worked hard that year and was promoted to honors math in seventh grade			0
recently , my son 's honors math teacher told me that the kids who try the hardest in her class are those who were n't in the sixth - grade class			1
the kids who got bumped up into honors just continue to work harder			2
this is when i realized that failing fast could ultimately pay off , not only in an entrepreneurial environment , but for our children , too			0
we do n't want our kids to be paralyzed by the fear of failure			1
to succeed in a world where innovation and creativity is the new currency , we want our kids to have the courage to try to push limits and take risks			2
" the world is so flat and the competitive landscape has changed , " says @entity155 , ceo and founder of the technology company @entity157			0
he is also the father of two girls , one of whom just found out that she was cut from her high school travel softball team			0
" kids need to learn lessons on how to work through this stuff and not become stressed out or paralyzed			2
we do n't want them giving up their dreams			0
we also need to create some toughness and mental skills around having to navigate disappointment so failure is not crushing			2
" when @entity155 hires employees , one of the things he looks for are people who can own their mistakes and not hide them			0
he 's found that among @entity176 he 's hiring now , the ones afraid to fail or admit failure are the ones who do n't survive at his company			1
" the more disruptive , innovative and game changing of an environment that you are trying to create , the more you need personalities that can try to work through it and deal with falling down , " @entity155 says			0
this is the culture of the changing economy			0
when our travel soccer league merged two teams into one a few weeks ago , nearly one - third of the girls were cut			0
at first , none of the parents wanted to tell their daughters the devastating news			2
we were scrambling to see if we could create a second team by pulling players from other places , all to avoid the disappointing truth that our daughters were no longer on the team			0
within a couple of days , i decided to take our girls and join a local recreational soccer team that was competitive and had some great parent coaches			0
pick up and move on -- that 's what i advised my fellow parents			1
i also thought this was a teachable moment for my own daughter			0
" resiliency and flexibility and the ability to adapt to the world is more important than ever , " @entity91 said			0
failure has never felt so good			2
