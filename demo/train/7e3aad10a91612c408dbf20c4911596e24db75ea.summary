-- last october , more than 40 people followed signs depicting a skull and crossbones , with a knife and fork in place of the bones , to a secluded @entity10 - style hunting lodge 30 minutes north of @entity11			1
an @entity13 dinner party was hosted in a @entity15 hunting lodge			0
the attendees did n't have any idea where they were headed or what to expect			0
all they knew was that they were in for a five - course meal courtesy of @entity21 , an undercover chef who 'd invited each of them via a top - secret e-mail to the latest of what he calls his @entity13 dinner parties			1
guests arrived to a bluegrass band jamming in a room decorated with deer antlers			0
as a fire crackled in the massive stone fireplace , they dined on wild - elk medallions , home - cured bacon , grapefruit confit , and butternut squash ice cream -- and toasted their good fortune with pumpkin ale from nearby microbrewery @entity41			1
welcome to the world of underground supper clubs			1
getting a reservation requires a little detective work , but once in , you may never go back to eating out the old - school way again			1
the idea behind these dinners is to let talented chefs work their whisks in an affordable , relaxed setting			2
and since they 're often operating out of their own kitchens , without a license to serve the public , these cooks have to keep the locales , and their own identities , under wraps			1
@entity0 : the utterly random dinner party " the trend started in food - centric cities like @entity68 , but in the last year , groups have been popping up across the country , " says @entity62 , author of " @entity63 , " which spotlights some of the more than 80 clubs now up and running in the @entity65 one such is @entity71 , founded by an incognito cook in @entity73 , @entity74 , who uses the @entity75 and wears a ninja mask at his gatherings			1
as at many clubs , diners must submit their reservations weeks in advance on @entity75 's web site and then wait for an e-mail with directions to the hush - hush locale			1
based on his track record , you wo n't be disappointed : the bearded @entity75 and his rotating crew of sous - chefs have served secret , @entity92 - style suppers ( andouille sausage gumbo , @entity93 smoked chicken , chocolate beignets ) in galleries , wineries , even a grocery store			1
@entity0 : haute diners @entity75 now has a little friendly competition from an @entity103 cook named @entity104			0
her @entity106 shindigs each have a different theme			0
at a recent event , a @entity110 - style repast in @entity111 , guests stood in a soup line for pancetta minestrone with porcini mushrooms , and lemongrass - spiked corn broth			2
then they divided into teams for an impromptu game of @entity119			0
" our goal , " @entity104 says , " is to make dining more inclusive and to have strangers connect over food			2
what better way to meet people ? " for those hoping to break bread with their own buddies , there 's @entity131 in @entity132			0
to keep operations simple , its mastermind , chef @entity133 , hosts the six - course dinners in his own apartment , hence the name			2
and unlike most supper clubs , @entity131 cooks only for groups of friends ( up to 12 at a time )			1
@entity0 : pay - what - you - like restaurants " even after working 16 - hour days , i would sit at home and think , ' i 've got to find a way to feed more people , ' " chef @entity133 says			2
money is n't the incentive			0
his minimum - donation fee of $ 50 just covers costs for a feast ( stuffed artichoke hearts , five - mushroom ravioli , butter - poached scallops served with @entity156 pulled pork ) that would average twice as much in a restaurant			0
but as chef @entity133 will attest , these clubs are less about saving and more about spending a night eating exceptionally well in the unlikeliest of places , whether a cozy lodge straight out of a fairy tale or a humble living room			0
