-- the @entity2 elephant , one of the world 's most majestic animals , is in danger			2
in the early 1900s , 5 million elephants roamed the @entity2 continent			2
then the ivory trade drove them to the brink of extinction , with 90 % of @entity2 elephants killed for the ivory in their tusks			1
in 1989 , the world reacted , imposing a ban on the international trade in ivory passed by the @entity21			1
but today , driven by growing demand for ivory ornaments and carvings in @entity27 , particularly in @entity28 , elephant poaching has returned with a vengeance			1
the largest slaughter in one year since the 1989 ban was passed happened in 2012 , with up to 35,000 elephants killed			1
this adds up to nearly 100 a day			0
tens of thousands are killed every year			1
without action , the day may come when this magnificent creature is known only in history books			0
estimates say if elephants continue to be slaughtered at today 's rates , the creatures could be extinct in a decade			2
not only do elephants die			0
the wildlife rangers who try to protect them from poachers are being killed			0
the illicit trade in ivory -- " white gold " -- is a billion dollar industry , and because it is illegal , it tends to attract some very bad actors			1
it is blood ivory : @entity55 , a wing of @entity57 based in @entity2 that is responsible for continued instability in @entity59 , is known to finance its operations through the poaching of elephants			1
@entity55 raises an estimated $ 600,000 a month through the ivory trade			1
the @entity64 , another terrorist group infamous for forcing children to fight in its ranks , also engages in poaching and trafficking of elephant ivory			1
stopping the ivory trade has become not only a matter of conservation but one of national security and international stability			1
last year , the @entity76 issued a report warning that elephant poaching is the worst it has been in a decade , while ivory seizures are at their highest levels since 1989			1
last summer , president @entity81 issued an executive order recognizing that the poaching of protected species and the illicit trade in ivory has become an international crisis that the @entity88 must take a leading role in combating			1
saving elephants and other threatened species is a cause that cuts across partisan lines and international boundaries			0
we all have a part to play			0
it starts in our personal lives			0
the ivory trade prospers because there is a demand for luxury goods fashioned from it			1
as consumers , we should never buy products made with ivory and should encourage others to be mindful that their purchases are not illegally sourced through trafficking			0
and we should continue to shine a spotlight on the problem of illegal poaching and the threat it poses to @entity2 elephants and other species			2
there are actions our government can take , as well			0
as co-chairman of the @entity121 , i have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to educate members of @entity126 on these ongoing problems and introduce legislation that authorizes proven conservation programs and directs resources to the international effort to dismantle the machinery of illegal poaching			2
the @entity133 is part of this effort			0
if passed , it would streamline and increase the effectiveness of our existing international conservation efforts			0
i am also working to reauthorize the @entity139 , which raises funds for the protection of threatened animals and their habitat at no cost to the @entity88 taxpayer			0
over the years , we have watched as the actions of a few shortsighted , malicious and greedy people have nearly destroyed whole species			0
if we act now , we can make sure that the @entity2 elephant does n't become another sad entry on a long list of animals we can never bring back			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .			2

@entity155 : the world almost killed off elephants completely before the ban on ivory in 1989
@entity155 : poaching has returned with a vengeance , *fueled* by demand for ivory in @entity28
ivory trade raises money for a wing of @entity57 and @entity64 terrorism
@entity155 : tens of thousands of elephants killed a year ; we need to *strengthen* legislation
