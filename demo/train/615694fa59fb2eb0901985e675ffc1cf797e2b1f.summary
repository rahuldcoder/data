@entity0 -- @entity5 's fear that promoters would " pull the plug " on his comeback concerts if he missed more rehearsals was unfounded , the head of the promotion company testified tuesday in dr. @entity11 's involuntary manslaughter trial			1
" no one on our end was ever contemplating pulling the plug , " said @entity12 , the head of @entity12			0
@entity11 's defense lawyers contend @entity5 self - administered the overdose of drugs that killed him in a " desperate desire to get to sleep , " because he feared without rest he would miss his next rehearsal and trigger the cancellation of his " @entity26 " tour			1
@entity5 's mother , @entity27 , sisters @entity28 and @entity29 , and brother @entity30 were in court to watch tuesday 's testimony			1
earlier tuesday , a nurse who tried to treat @entity5 's insomnia with natural remedies testified that @entity5 told her that doctors assured him using the surgical anesthetic propofol at home to induce sleep was safe as long as he was monitored			1
@entity5 died two months after that conversation with nurse @entity41 , from what the coroner ruled was an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol , combined with sedatives			1
prosecutors contend dr. @entity11 's use of propofol to treat @entity5 's insomnia in his home was reckless , in part because he did not have proper equipment to monitor his patient and he abandoned him to make phone calls			1
@entity12 was the eighth witness called by the defense since the prosecution rested its case against @entity11 monday morning			0
if the tour was canceled , @entity5 would have to pay for all of the production and rehearsal costs , @entity12 said , although the judge would not let him tell jurors how much that might have been			1
defense lawyer @entity64 estimated the cost to be about $ 40 million , leaving him " a very , very poor man , " but it was not while the jury was present			0
concert director @entity70 sent @entity12 an e-mail five days before @entity5 's death referring to @entity5 's fear the company would " pull the plug " on the tour			1
the e-mail triggered a meeting with @entity5 and dr. @entity11 to address @entity70 's concerns about @entity5 's " lack of focus " and missed rehearsals , with the debut of his @entity83 shows just three weeks away			2
he and @entity70 were satisfied when @entity5 told them " you build the house and i will put on the door and paint it , " suggesting he would be ready , @entity12 testified			1
also at the meeting , @entity12 told dr. @entity11 that he wanted to make sure he knew about @entity5 's visits to another doctor , dermatologist dr. @entity90			2
" because he 's his principal physician , i thought he should know , " he said			0
@entity12 said he was concerned because @entity5 " seemed a little distracted and not focused " in a meeting after a visit to @entity90 's @entity94 clinic			2
the defense contends @entity5 became addicted to the painkiller @entity96 in his frequent visits to @entity90 in the three months before his death			0
his withdrawal from the @entity96 , which @entity11 was unaware of , would explain why @entity5 could not sleep the day he died , the defense contends			2
testimony from nurse @entity41 's was interrupted for 25 minutes tuesday as she was overcome with emotion			0
" i 'm feeling really , really dizzy , " @entity105 said			0
" this is just very sensitive to me			0
" @entity105 and a @entity0 doctor , both called as defense witnesses , testified that @entity5 asked them for drugs to help him sleep in april 2009			2
this was after dr. @entity11 had already agreed to work as his personal physician and placed his first orders for propofol			0
@entity105 , who used iv drips loaded with vitamins , " sophisticated " vitamin smoothies and bedtime teas , to treat @entity5 's insomnia , said @entity5 became frustrated with her natural remedies			0
" he said ' i 'm telling you the only thing that 's going to help me sleep right away is the @entity125 and can you find someone to help me to sleep ? ' " @entity105 said			0
@entity125 is a brand name for propofol			0
after some quick research , the nurse warned @entity5 that it was dangerous to use propofol at home , @entity105 testified			1
@entity5 was not deterred , she said , even after she asked him " but what if you do n't wake up ? " deputy district attorney @entity136 asked her , " and he responded , ' i will be ok , i only need someone to monitor me with the equipment while i sleep ' ? " " yes , that 's exactly what i said , " @entity105 said			1
dr. @entity141 , who treated @entity5 off and on for two decades for " his profound sleep disorder , " testified monday that @entity5 called him to his home on april 18 , 2009 , to ask for " intravenous sleep medicine " to help him sleep			1
@entity5 wanted the anesthetic delivered by @entity148 because " he did not believe any oral medicine would be helpful , " dr. @entity141 said			0
@entity141 declined @entity5 's request , instead giving him prescriptions for two oral sedatives to help him sleep .			2
