-- a series of 30 - year - old television interviews does n't sound like promising movie material			1
@entity4 gives " a heavyweight performance " as @entity5 , says @entity7			1
what 's more , those who have watched all 20 - plus hours of the @entity10 - @entity5 conversations , which form the center of " @entity12 , " recently report that they 're overwhelmingly dry and dull , with the ex-president ably stonewalling questions that were not to his liking and indulging in elaborate self - justification on those that were			1
of course , that 's not what we remember			2
on the last day of 12 interview sessions , as had been agreed , @entity24 journalist @entity10 finally broached @entity26			1
this was always going to be the make - or - break moment			0
and to everyone 's astonishment , it was @entity12 who broke			1
those fascinatingly unexpurgated five minutes of presidential floundering in the spring of 1977 weighed more than all the hours of explication that preceded them			2
at last , @entity37 admitted misdeeds -- not illegality as such , because , he claimed , the president can not break the law			0
that exchange made @entity10 's reputation and sealed @entity12 's public ignominy			1
( some would argue that today such a sentiment is official government policy			0
) can you build a movie on five revelatory minutes ? if you 're @entity50 , the answer is yes			2
the @entity24 playwright and screenwriter has a thing about mismatched power couples : the relationships between @entity56 and @entity57 in " @entity58 " ; a young @entity60 medic and @entity62 president @entity61 in " @entity66 " ; and between @entity63 and @entity64 in " @entity65 , " to name just his most recent credits			0
@entity50 seems both awed and appalled by these power - mongers , locked in the solitary confinement that political leadership entails -- though his instinct is always to bring them down to earth , to find some common ground , however fleeting it may be			0
interviews often are described as a courtship or seduction , but this one was more of a cross-examination			2
" a duel , " @entity12 calls it			2
in a sense it 's the trial he never faced			0
the entire country would be his jury			0
much of the movie is designed to show us how the self - appointed prosecutor was ill - equipped for the task at hand : a playboy @entity24 comedian - turned - tv chat show host @entity95 , more accustomed to trading quips with the @entity97 than grilling presidents			0
@entity10 was a lightweight -- that 's one of the reasons @entity12 and his people agreed to the interview			1
( there were $ 600,000 more -- a landmark in checkbook journalism that director @entity107 does n't lose much sleep over			0
) neither actor goes for a full - on impersonation			0
@entity111 -- @entity56 in " @entity58 " -- actually dials down @entity10 's distinctive nasal drone , but suggests how this congenial suck - up coasted on his blow - dried charm , rakish sideburns and unrealistic self - confidence			1
@entity10 may be out of his depth , but he 's not about to let it cramp his style ; he 's delighted when the ex-president admires his slip - on @entity122 shoes			1
as @entity12 , @entity4 ( like @entity111 a holdover from the award - winning @entity125 production ) is suitably hunched and guttural , but more patrician and less jowly , than the real @entity128			1
even so , it 's a heavyweight performance			0
this @entity12 is full of pride and fury , cerebral and rigorous but fatally hungry for exoneration , or , failing that ( though he never quite admits it ) , forgiveness			2
@entity137 and brazen in comparison with " @entity58 , " @entity50 's script does n't stop explaining itself and talking itself up , though what it all boils down to is rather less than meets the eye			0
at one point , a drunken wake - up call from @entity12 finally kicks @entity10 into doing some hard journalism , but this a figment of the screenwriter 's overly tidy creative imagination			1
ireport.com : share reviews of ' @entity12 ' but @entity50 is rock solid when it comes to structure			2
it 's a compelling account , shrewdly bolstered with lively actors in both corners of the ring : @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 in @entity10 's camp ; @entity163 and @entity164 attending to the president			1
@entity163 steals his every scene as the bald germophobe and legendary agent @entity168 , a neat counterpoint to his turn as @entity170 in " w. " " @entity12 " does n't have much to say about the disgraced president that @entity173 , for one , has n't already explored in more depth , but by the last taping , in its glib and reductionist way , it works like a charm			1
or better yet , like television			0
which , finally , is a compliment			0
" @entity12 " runs 122 minutes and is rated @entity183 's take , click here .			1

" @entity12 " features great performances by @entity4 , @entity111
film is *dramatization* of @entity10 's 1977 interviews with ex-president @entity12
though movie is sometimes glib , acting *raises* it to a high level
