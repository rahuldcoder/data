@entity10 was born as a girl in @entity1 and raised as a devout @entity6			2
but after his sex change operation eight years ago , many people scorned him in church in his hometown of @entity0 in western @entity1			1
@entity10 recalls heated discussions with a parish priest and some others in town			2
afterward , he started staying away from @entity20 " i 've never lost faith , ever , " @entity10 says			2
" but the other thing is the rejection			0
" he wrote to @entity3 last year , saying his local bishop helped get the letter noticed			0
