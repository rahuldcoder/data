@entity0 is not a game that looks ready to take off among @entity4 sports fans -- but it could be about to provide an unexpected new career for professional athletes in the @entity4			1
despite the millions earned in @entity8 , the minor leagues are filled with players only pocketing around $ 1,000 a month as they chase a dwindling dream of making it big			1
it 's a breadline salary so low that it has sparked a class - act lawsuit against major teams			2
but one man thinks another way out is for minor leaguers to take their professional skills and switch them to another ball game			2
@entity21 , the former fielding coach for @entity24 's @entity23 cricketers who also played baseball for @entity26 , is recruiting @entity4 players to a scheme he calls @entity29 20 -- aimed at taking the inherent aptitude and athleticism of ballplayers and training them in the nuances of @entity36 cricket			1
" i 'm not trying to take players away from a baseball career , " says @entity21 , who had tryouts with the @entity38 , the @entity39 and the @entity40 , before coaching some of cricket 's top international teams using skills learned in the ballpark			1
" but any current minor leaguers who feel they are n't going to make it , or guys who have recently been cut or quit because they simply can not afford to carry on ; they are perfect for a career in modern cricket			1
and the key things for these guys is that it pays considerably better than the @entity56			0
" it 's something he 's already done once			0
after leaving his post with @entity24 last year , he converted a group of @entity63 baseball players into a national cricket team that reached the quarterfinals of the @entity66 this fall			1
" having moved back and forth between the two sports myself , i know the potential these guys have for success in @entity36 cricket , " says @entity21			1
" i was the first to introduce baseball fielding techniques to international cricket , because a major league outfielder will out - throw a professional cricketer every time			1
this is a sport that @entity4 can do well at			1
" minor leaguer @entity78 has been chasing the dream of the big leagues since he was a boy			2
his looks , his build , the way he talks and even his name are as near to the definition of an @entity4 ballplayer as you 're going to get			1
but beyond the square jaw and the all - state honors as both outfielder and quarterback , there 's one thing that makes him different to every other guy out there on the diamond			0
he wants to be the greatest cricket player the world has ever seen			1
@entity100 got the nickname " @entity106 " thanks to the tornado crashing past the @entity104 hospital where he was born in june 1989			0
a couple of decades later and his .374 batting average , with 13 home runs in 60 junior - year games at @entity111 , saw him eventually signed by the @entity112			0
his story since then is depressingly similar to thousands like him , becalmed in the minor leagues on a poverty - line salary of $ 1,200 a month			2
" i 'm always an optimist			0
i 'm 25 years old			0
this year will probably prove a lot			0
i want to make the big leagues and i 'm going to work my butt off until it happens or does n't happen , " @entity78 said in his break between working an eight - hour milk delivery shift and a full afternoon of offseason training			0
@entity78 is one of the first signups to @entity125 20 , and talks with surprising enthusiasm about a sport he has only seen on @entity129 links sent to him by @entity21			1
cricket 's revolution 11 years ago into @entity36 or @entity36 -- with games taking three hours instead of five days -- has seen sleepy spectators replaced with raucous crowds , batters swinging for the fences instead of blocking balls , cheerleaders on the sidelines , and the creation of new competitions			1
the annual @entity141 , for instance , awards the best players seven - figure contracts for a season lasting just eight weeks			2
@entity78 hopes it can save him from 3.45am wakeup calls and the end of his athletic career , but believes he has something to contribute as well			0
" i 've always wanted to do something to change the world -- something that i can put my stamp on , " he says			2
" @entity155 did it for african - americans in baseball			2
we can do it for @entity4 in cricket			1
" the athleticism that @entity4 can bring to the table could revolutionize the game of cricket even more to become a bigger , faster , stronger sport			1
" look at soccer now			0
that all came from @entity4 players making a stand in what was a minority sport over here			1
" if you would 've said ' soccer ' about five years ago people would 've said , " get outta here , man "			0
now everyone 's watching the @entity178			0
" another player hoping to break the mold is middle infielder @entity181 , a 24 - year - old drafted by the @entity182 in 2012 but now with @entity183 independents the @entity184 -- and studying for an @entity185 as a @entity186 " a lot of us guys in the minor leagues have to take the decision -- are my legs going to hold up , or my bank account , and which is going to go first ? " @entity181 says			1
" in my case it 'll be the bank account , because i know that otherwise i 'll never be ready to finish playing ball			0
" i 've talked to my girlfriend about the cricket thing			2
we 'd go through about five or 10 minutes thinking how amazing it would be , traveling the world playing sport			0
then it would be , ' what the hell am i saying ? ' it 's ping - pong in my brain			0
" for @entity21 , the endgame goes beyond getting his players a @entity36 contract			1
" i want to inject enough talent into @entity4 cricket , to see it bounce back up the rankings			1
i want to coach a @entity4 team at a @entity178			1
" a team already exists , but he believes replacing its largely ex-pat spine with @entity4 baseball talent is the only way it can join the elite			1
" wearing a jersey with the flag on the front and your name on the back is huge for any @entity4 , " says @entity181			1
but @entity21 has also let his early sign ups know that there are a few things to iron out before he can start printing jerseys			1
" i 'm aiming for tryouts in the spring , so the guys who are already with teams , or trying out for teams can also come and try out for me , " says @entity21			1
we 're in talks with some interested parties but even if companies like @entity242 can lay on some tickets to get these players to the tryout , that would help			0
" i 've wanted to do this for years -- i talked to some tv companies about a reality tv show back in 2010 and i hope it could still be a part of it			0
" @entity251 , 23 , was another earning in the region of $ 14,000 a year with a @entity112 affiliate before they let him go this past season			0
" i think if we all started playing cricket , i do n't think the expectation would be that we 're going to be stars and make millions , " he says			0
" it would just be great to be the first to bring it out to @entity4			2
then see where it goes after that			0
" if the project stalls , @entity78 is prepared to go it alone			0
" the whole thing with me is that whatever happens , i still want to go overseas and try because i have got that excitement so high , " he says			0
" i still want to go and train with @entity21 to try it out myself			2
if we can work out a living situation with food , i would do it in a heartbeat			0
i do n't have to have some sort of income , just as long as me and my wife have food and a place to stay			0
" i know that i 'm not going to be the best in the world in the first five years of playing the sport			0
but i 'm also never going to go in and say , ' i 'll just be ok			0
' " i 'm going to go and try and be the best cricket player in the world			1
" @entity21 says it will take less time than @entity78 thinks			2
" these guys have the potential to take the world of @entity36 cricket by storm , " he said			1
" for the last few years you have heard cricket announcers use the phrase , ' that was a real baseball shot			2
' " well now you will be able to see those so - called baseball shots executed by guys who really can hit a ball 400 feet -- with a bat whose hitting area is a fraction of the width of a cricket bat			2
