-- the @entity3 , in charge of " organizing and securing @entity2 , " announced thursday that courts in the city will start operating next week			1
" people must realize that the country 's system has been destroyed and is being rebuilt now , " said lt. colonel @entity6 , head of the council			1
he said detained prisoners will be directed toward the general prosecutor for " clearer " due process			2
the change was announced the same day a report from @entity17 detailed claims of abuse against prisoners by @entity21 forces			1
for example , last august , fighters in a house in @entity24 tied the hands of two brothers from the southern city of @entity29 and beat them while taking them into custody , according to the report			2
" they beat us several times using their rifles , " the elder brother told the human rights group			1
" they also whipped us			2
when they transferred us to @entity40 ( the airport detention facility ) , they forced us to walk on our knees to the vehicles while they insulted and beat us			0
they accused us of being mercenaries			0
" the report says that militia members detained as many as 2,500 suspected @entity50 loyalists in the @entity2 area and that , in nearly every case , people were arrested without warrants and far from the oversight of the @entity56			1
@entity57 , @entity17 's @entity58 researcher , told @entity0 on thursday that the arrests were more like abductions -- people taken from their homes by unidentified captors carrying out raids on suspected @entity50 loyalists			1
" we spoke to several guards , " said @entity57 , who added she heard screams from detainees being whipped as she waited in one of the facilities			0
" they did n't see a problem to beat detainees to extract information			0
to them it was normal			0
" it was the way things had been done for the four decades of @entity50 's iron - fisted rule			1
after visiting 11 facilities and interviewing 300 detainees , some of them women and children , the @entity17 team found that culture very much in place as @entity2 was falling			1
a 17 - year - old boy from @entity88 , accused of rape and of being a mercenary , told @entity17 that he was taken from his home in august by armed men who held him in a school where they punched him and beat him with sticks , belts , rifles and rubber cables			1
" the beatings were so severe that i ended up telling them what they wanted to hear , " he said			0
" i told them i raped women and killed @entity104			1
" in issuing the report , @entity17 called on @entity104 's @entity106 to put end such human rights violations			1
many of the militias are working outside the law , @entity57 said			2
" what the national council needs to do from the very beginning is to send a strong signal that this behavior will not be tolerated , " she said			0
@entity6 acknowledged incidents of abuse but said they were isolated			0
he said members of his security staff were present during the @entity17 interviews and that they have nothing to hide			2
he denied the scope and gravity of the abuses depicted in the @entity17 report			1
" yes , there have been infringements related to beating detainees under arrest , but i would not call it torture , " @entity6 said			0
" these are isolated incidents caused by rebels who were emotional due to the fighting and losing friends or relatives in the war , but it 's no organized beatings or designed to extract confessions			2
" @entity142 has also documented accounts of detainee abuse that amounts to torture			0
the global monitor issued a report earlier this month that urged @entity104 to ensure that the rule of law prevails as it forges ahead in building a new nation			1
those interviewed told @entity142 that they were beaten and given electric shocks			2
some showed their scars as proof of their claims			0
one man wept openly in telling his story of abuse			0
a detainee identified as @entity159 said this : " they took an electric cable and started hitting me with it			0
they did n't use electricity , but they said that if i did n't talk , they would			0
... they hit me with a butt of the @entity171			0
they kicked me in the face and in the chest			0
one scratched me with the knife ( bayonet ) of the @entity171			0
" @entity142 said none of the detainees has ever faced a judge			0
" after all that @entity104 suffered in @entity50 's jails , it 's disheartening that some of the new authorities are subjecting detainees to arbitrary arrest and beatings today , " said @entity180 , deputy @entity181 and @entity58 director at @entity142			1
as a state party to the @entity192 and the @entity193 , @entity104 has an obligation to prevent torture and abuse , @entity17 said			1
@entity104 authorities , the group said , can not allow such abuses to go on simply because the nation is in a transitional phase			1
if they do , said the human rights activists , @entity104 's new leadership will be no better than the old			1
@entity6 also spoke thursday against foreign security companies coming into @entity104			2
noting that " there is no clear visa system for entry and the borders are not fully organized , " he said that nine foreign security companies , some of them @entity210 , have established bases in @entity104 without permission			1
" we have compiled data on them and informed the @entity217 , " @entity6 said			0
" the @entity104 people ( do ) not want foreign security companies			2
" @entity0 's @entity220 and @entity221 contributed to this report .			2

@entity224 : " the country 's system has been destroyed , " says the head of @entity2 operations
new : the *announcement* comes the same day @entity17 issues *damning* report
suspected @entity50 loyalists were beaten and abused , the group says
human rights activists say rule of law , *absent* in @entity104 under @entity50 , must be ensured
