-- on her way to @entity3 , secretary of state @entity1 said sunday that the @entity4 would n't cut aid to the economically and politically unsettled @entity7 nation -- despite major concerns about its recent and upcoming presidential elections			1
@entity11 said she planned to keep up pressure on the @entity14 government , headed by president @entity15 , to honor recommendations from the @entity17 related to who is on the ballot for its pivotal upcoming presidential runoff			1
still , she said that any political differences would not affect @entity4 support for @entity3 , an already impoverished country before a devastating earthquake last year followed months later by a deadly cholera outbreak			1
more than 200,000 people have been sickened and 4,030 have died as of january 24 , according to the latest report posted by the ministry			0
" we are not talking about any of that , " @entity11 told reporters			1
" we have a deep commitment to the @entity3 people			1
and that ( applies ) to humanitarian aid , it goes to governance and democracy programs			0
" while @entity11 will visit a cholera clinic , addressing @entity3 's political turmoil will largely dominate her visit			1
shortly after the november 28 presidential elections , @entity3 's electoral council announced that former first lady @entity43 had won but lacked a majority of votes for an outright victory			2
initial results put her in a runoff with @entity49 , a protege of the president			2
the third - place candidate , popular musician @entity51 , claimed he had won more votes than @entity49 and a review of results by an @entity17 team supported that contention			0
that review suggested that @entity51 earned a spot in the runoff			0
" the international community has been very clear , and i am going to carry that message , " said @entity11 , alluding to the @entity4 support for allowing @entity51 on the runoff ballot			1
" but i will also be listening			0
" she said she 'll meet with all three potential candidates -- @entity43 , @entity49 and @entity51 -- during her trip this week to @entity3 , as well as with president @entity15			1
on sunday , @entity11 acknowledged " many complications " and " legitimate concerns , " including a tight timeline			1
but she added that the @entity4 was in sync with the prevailing view of diplomats from @entity74 , as well as the @entity75 and @entity76			2
it 's unclear whether @entity15 's ruling @entity80 ( @entity79 ) party plans to withdraw its support of @entity49 in light of the election review			0
discontent with @entity15 and his government manifested itself on the streets of @entity3 after the preliminary results were announced			2
@entity3 charged vote fraud and burned cars , tires and @entity49 's campaign headquarters in @entity14			2
the electoral council said it will announce the final results of the first round on wednesday			0
the runoff is scheduled for march 20 , and final results will not be known until april 16			0
" if there are ideas that we should follow up on , we will take those into account , " @entity11 said of her planned discussions with @entity3 leaders and candidates			1
" but we want to see the @entity17 recommendations followed			0
" @entity0 's @entity106 contributed to this report			0
