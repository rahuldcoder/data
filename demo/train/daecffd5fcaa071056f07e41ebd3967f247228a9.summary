-- @entity1 may be a target for many luxury brands but @entity4 , famous for its simple and elegant designs , is keeping its footprint on the city light			1
founded by @entity10 in 1909 , the fashion house redefined outfits for women with its timeless outfits			1
today the @entity15 label house is recognized as a pioneer of tailored and ready - to - wear collections			1
but it has been careful not to overwhelm markets , choosing instead to focus on brand exclusivity			2
@entity4 's president of fashion , @entity21 , said such exclusivity is the best way to ensure customers keep coming back for more			1
@entity4 has opened just three boutiques in @entity1 -- one of the world 's most populous cities			1
@entity21 told @entity0 : " we try to get the best three boutiques in @entity1 instead of having 10 boutiques			2
" that , he said , is the " number one " priority			0
" we try to bring through the boutiques the best value of the brand ... our idea is not to open lots of boutiques but be able to give , through the existing one , the best value and the best service to our customers			0
" @entity46 -- with a population of approximately 1.3 billion people -- is a focus for luxury brands due to its expanding middle classes			1
its growth comes as consumer spending in @entity56 and the @entity57 dwindles			0
@entity21 said customers in @entity46 are " experts of the fashion world , they know everything , every detail and at the end of the day what they want is the same product that we are selling here in @entity69 or @entity70			2
" the company remains privately held and @entity21 says the absence of shareholders eases the pressure on @entity4			0
" it gives us the possibility to put more focus on the company 20 years from now ... and even increase the attractiveness to our consumers , " he said			0
