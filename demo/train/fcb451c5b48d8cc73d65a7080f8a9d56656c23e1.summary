sunday , january 18 , 2014 wow ! sunday evening , it 's 9:30 p.m. , and i am beat			0
guess i will find out how the @entity3 did in the @entity5 playoff tomorrow ( the game would have started at 11:40 p.m. local time )			0
i arrived here in @entity10 friday evening , january 16 , after a 26 hour trip ( three flights with a long layover in @entity14 ) , with my seven pieces of luggage , filled mostly with donated drugs and supplies for @entity19 , the @entity8 runs just outside @entity20			1
i 've spent some time catching up with our @entity10 country director , @entity21 , who just got back here from the @entity24 about five days ago , and dr. @entity25 , my colleague who has been anchoring the hospital medical staff throughout the @entity28 crisis			1
because i was n't due to report for work until monday , we decided to clean the apartment where i had stayed in august , as it had been unoccupied since i left			0
dr. @entity25 and i suited up in gloves and gowns this afternoon to clean out the apartment , bleaching items that were valuable ( like my kindle and my digital camera , which both seem to work ) , disposing of the rest , washing the dishes in bleach and soap , and mopping all the surfaces with bleach			1
after a few more days of airing out , it will be ready to use			0
it took over 4 hours in 90 degree heat			0
we were drenched with sweat -- no wonder i am exhausted ! later , when i tested my camera to see if it still worked after sitting in the humid , salty air for four months , i looked at the pictures i had taken back in august			1
the final picture was one taken after i developed a fever : it was of a lovely pineapple upside down cake , baked by a good friend from church who did n't even realize i was sick			2
her son had brought it to me after sunday worship service , and i told him he had to just leave it on the step			0
returning to the apartment , and seeing the picture of the cake , brought me right back to my last weekend there			2
it sharpened my recollection of my feelings -- waiting anxiously to see if my fever would break , praying earnestly and tearfully , and focusing my thoughts on @entity75 's love and care for me , whatever was to come			2
seeing all my friends and colleagues , both missionaries and @entity81 , has been great ! it does feel like something is missing from our reunion , since we are not hugging or shaking hands in @entity10 at this time			1
but still -- there have been wonderful smiles as people recognize me and express their thanks to @entity75 that my life was spared			2
@entity81 really know how to smile			0
most people are visibly relieved by the improvement in conditions			0
the number of cases of @entity28 has come down markedly -- the @entity98 unit associated with our hospital is now empty			1
there are still scattered cases in isolated pockets around the city , and in the rural areas in western @entity10			1
people seem optimistic but still very vigilant			0
they remember that there was a significant drop in cases back in may , early in the epidemic , which turned out to be just a lull followed by a huge second wave			2
it also sounds like more people are getting themselves to a treatment unit on time for care , so the survival rate is higher than it was at first			0
a dear friend told me the sad story of her neighbor who died of @entity28 in november			1
he was in denial the entire time , and would not admit that his symptoms might be due to @entity28			1
he died and unfortunately eight others in his family also got sick and died			0
many are recognizing this pattern : those who are quicker to suspect @entity28 and get tested do much better themselves , and help protect their family and community			1
on the other hand , those who remain in denial , end up harming the ones they love			0
on the whole , @entity10 has come to grips with the reality of @entity28 , and i feel proud of their resilience and determination to beat this virus , with @entity75 's help .			1

dr. @entity146 was treating **patients** in @entity10 when he got sick with @entity28
he recovered in the @entity149 and went back to continue to help **patients**
life felt different when he arrived back home , but he is glad to be back helping provide medical care
