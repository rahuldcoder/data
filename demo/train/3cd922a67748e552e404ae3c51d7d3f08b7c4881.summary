-- @entity1 was backing out of his driveway for a midday burrito run with a friend when he heard the sirens			1
he was driving down the street when he saw the flashing lights at @entity8			1
that 's when what @entity1 calls " initial parent paranoia " set in			1
" are you ok " @entity1 texted his high - schooler son , @entity12 , at 12:48 p.m. friday , at first fearing not a shooting but something awry with his diabetic son 's health			1
" i 'm fine , " @entity12 texted back			2
but the school 's on lockdown , he added			2
" whoa , " @entity1 texted back			1
what followed was a remarkable string of 70 more texts , displaying remarkable calm and the bond between a father and son amid a crisis that made national headlines			1
@entity1 , a web developer and self - avowed " data sharer , " said monday he posted the texts to his website to revisit later , to write about more , to remind him on some distant day that " my relationship with my son is absolutely where i want it to be			1
" shooting victim described as sweet , smart " we 're in lockdown " friday 's shooting began at 12:33 p.m. , when , according to police accounts , 18 - year - old student @entity40 walked into the @entity43 , @entity44 , school armed with a pump - action shotgun , a machete and a backpack containing three @entity49 cocktails , a bandolier of ammunition across his chest			1
according to police , @entity40 shot 17 - year - old @entity55 once in the head amid shots fired randomly into school hallways			1
he also ignited one of the firebombs in the school library before killing himself in the back corner of the school library			2
@entity1 did n't know any of that when he heard the sirens and saw the lights at the high school he once attended and where @entity12 now goes to school			1
but he knew something was wrong			2
he steered the car not toward the @entity72 restaurant where he and a friend had planned to have lunch , but toward his son 's school			1
" are you ok " he texted			2
" there are ambulances going to @entity80			2
" " i 'm fine , " the boy wrote back			1
" lessons of @entity85 and other school shootings helped in @entity80 a constant dread a school shooting has long been one of the characters in the cast of fears that dances through @entity1 's mind when it comes to his three children			1
he remembers being a young , young father -- barely out of high school -- cradling 1 - year - old @entity12 and watching the horror of @entity85 play out down the road from him in 1999			1
the slaughter at @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity103 , a year ago only intensified the dread			0
he vowed back in 1999 he 'd never have a gun in his home			0
and the plague of school shootings since then has only strengthened his belief that @entity111 gun laws are , in his words , " severely underpowered			0
" but , on friday , he was n't thinking about gun laws			0
he had only one thing on his mind : his son			1
" i am here and will be here " four minutes had passed since @entity1 first texted his son			1
" what 's going on , " he asked			0
" dunno , " @entity12 wrote back			1
" we heard something like a gunshot and then an administrator came by to make sure the door was locked			0
now we 're all huddled in a corner			0
" " please keep telling me you 're ok , " @entity1 texted his son			1
i 'm good , the son replied , promising to text every five minutes			2
" ok i am here and will be here , " @entity1 texted			1
" until i have you			0
" school gunman liked debate , acted ' weird ' at times " he 's here " dozens of texts followed			2
can you get to the @entity141 ? no , @entity12 says			0
go to the @entity144 instead			0
i 'm there , @entity145 says			0
you have to check me out , the son says			2
standing in line , @entity145 answers			0
" okay thanks , " @entity12 texts			2
and then nothing for more than four hours			0
the last entry is a photo -- @entity1 and his son on the basement couch , alone , after @entity1 had broken down in tears			1
after the rest of the family had gone from crying to celebrating			0
after everyone else had headed upstairs to decorate the christmas tree			0
" @entity163 , " @entity1 told @entity0 on monday of the moment			1
" he 's here , and what have we been through together			0
" a message on a hand another @entity80 student , @entity169 , had his own message			1
it was written on his hand , in case he did n't get out alive			2
" family , i love you all so much , " @entity169 scrawled , the last two words underlined			0
then he added , " i 'm up here now , " above a picture of a cross			0
@entity169 told @entity0 's the lead that he was in a literature class when he and his classmates heard a loud bang from down the hall			0
he did n't think anything of it until they heard two more			0
his teacher 's face " just became completely pale , " he said , and everyone rushed to a corner of classroom away from doors and windows			0
he 's kept the ball - point pen he used to write that farewell ever since			2
" i 've never had such a frightening experience in my life before that , " @entity169 said			0
" it really changed how i looked at my life , and just my whole perspective on what life is			0
