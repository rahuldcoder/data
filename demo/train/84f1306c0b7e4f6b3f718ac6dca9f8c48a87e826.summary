it 's like @entity2 , except there are goats , magical enchiladas and kittens that can kill you			2
and that 's apparently enough for people to pledge a gajillion dollars			0
@entity11 , the cartoonist and grammar enthusiast behind the popular comic website @entity14 , launched a fund - raising campaign on @entity16 tuesday for a new card game that got more than $ 700,000 in pledges in just the first few hours			1
by wednesday , @entity19 raised over $ 2 million			1
the game is a cross between @entity24 's signature absurdist comic drawings and the popular card game @entity2			1
it was dreamed up by @entity24 and game creators @entity28 and @entity29 , according to the @entity30			0
the initial goal was $ 10,000			0
although there are a lot of reasons why the @entity37 loves kittens , one hint to @entity19 ' fiery success is the @entity40 's cult following			0
its @entity42 page alone has more than 3 million followers			0
the game rules are explained in a short animated video on the @entity16 page			1
each player draws a card from the deck until someone draws an exploding kitten card			1
once an exploding kitten card is drawn the player is booted from the game			1
the more cards that are drawn from the deck , the higher a player 's chances of pulling an exploding kitten card			2
the game also adds a bit of humorous complexity , featuring cards that enable players powers such as weaponizing back hair and laser pointers to defuse a kitten 's explosiveness			2
exploding kittens might seem too magically absurd to be true , but with the success of other @entity16 campaigns such as party game favorite @entity73 , this project might be another crowd - funded home run			1
@entity1 reached out to @entity24 and his creative team for a comment , but no one was available to talk			0
" sorry all inboxes are so flooded right now , " @entity28 wrote			0
the game creators did note on their fund - raising page that they are staunchly against the harming of actual kittens			1
on @entity14 's @entity42 page , @entity24 wrote that the @entity16 goal was reached in eight minutes			2
" i love you , my precious @entity90			0
who wants a sandwich ? "			0
