-- we 've all done it			0
your friend uploads a picture of their new puppy to @entity8 , and you somehow manage to leave a comment congratulating them instead on their " new pappy			1
" so what do you do ? until now , the only thing @entity8 would let you do to correct the error was delete the comment and start again			2
but starting thursday the site is also now offering the ability to edit your comment â € ” and change that pappy back to the puppy you intended in the first place			2
the edit option appears in the form of a small pencil icon on the right side of your comment			0
clicking on the pencil will bring up a drop - down menu with the option to edit your comment as well as the option to delete it entirely			1
@entity8 told @entity0 the site will also be " showing the editing history for a comment so that subsequent commenters or likers have the full context of the conversation			1
" that way if someone responds to a comment that gets edited commenters in the future can see the history of the conversation and not get lost			0
the editing ability went live on thursday evening , and will be gradually rolling out to all users over the next few days			1
has the comment editing system kicked in for you yet ? let us know in the comments			0

as of thursday , @entity8 allows users to edit comments rather than *retype* them .
each comment will show its editing history in a drop - down menu to give users context .
@entity65 will be rolled out to users gradually over the next few days .
