-- @entity1 got her long - awaited answer in the form of a one sentence text message : " we had a productive day and determined the engine contained a two bladed propeller			2
" it was not what @entity1 wanted to hear ; nevertheless , she was prepared for it			2
@entity1 had been hoping to learn if plane wreckage recently discovered eight floors below the surface of the @entity14 , 20 miles off the coast of @entity16 , @entity17 , was her father 's twin engine @entity20 which disappeared without a trace one february night 16 years ago			1
@entity21 , a marine conservationist and the executive director of an artificial reef building company in @entity24 , led a dive last weekend to search for clues			2
" i personally felt bad that we were not able help her further in her journey for closure at this point , " @entity21 said later			1
" i had prepared myself for the news that it may not be my @entity34 's plane , " @entity1 admitted			1
" it is very comforting and refreshing to know there are people like @entity21 out there that have the kind of heart to want to help someone that may need answers			2
@entity21 and his team have brought me closer to finding this thing called closure			1
" @entity21 found himself in the middle of this aviation puzzle purely by happenstance			2
during a dive last month to map a site for artificial reefs , he discovered the plane wreckage : tires , turbine blade , a pair of engines and other parts			1
@entity1 heard about @entity21 's find and drove from her home in @entity63 , @entity64 to meet him and learn more			1
see the photos and videos two diving teams comprised of eight people went down on sunday morning			2
@entity21 's goal was to lift one of the two engines buried 75 % in the sandy sea floor			1
he and his group wanted to figure out how many blades were on the propeller			0
if there were three blades , there was still a chance it was the plane belonging to @entity1 ' father			1
the first diving team consisted of @entity86 , photographer @entity81 and lift bag operators @entity82 and @entity84			0
the second dive team included @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 who went along to observe			0
the conditions were favorable although the water a bit murky when the first team dove around 8:30am carrying two lift bags , one for each buried engine located about 40 feet apart			0
@entity21 said , " for safety reasons and to avoid the possibility of the engine drifting off and being lost , i connected a 50 foot tether line between the two engines			0
" it did n't take long for the inflatable lift bag to raise the approximate 400 pound engine from its resting spot			0
" when the engine ripped out of the ground from the brute force created by the lift bag it shot up until the tether caught it , " @entity21 recounted			0
immediately , the search teams saw it was a two bladed prop with stamped numbers 15911 imprinted in the metal			0
using the information , @entity21 contacted @entity117 , an @entity119 - based designer and manufacturer of propellers			0
@entity122 , a technical support employee at @entity123 , said , " it 's not the first time " someone has contacted him to help solve an aviation mystery			1
using the underwater pictures taken by @entity21 's dive team , @entity122 determined the propeller was likely made on january 3 , 1968 and shipped to a @entity132 aircraft company in @entity133			1
" if 15911 is the correct factory number , the prop is an @entity138 - @entity137 - @entity136			0
it 's an @entity140 prop , and we sold it to @entity132 in @entity143 , so it could be original equipment on the aircraft , " @entity122 said			1
" we sent a truckload of propellers to @entity143 where they bolted propellers to new planes , " he said			0
but that 's about as far as he could go in determining who owned the plane			1
" it 's like @entity155 sending shoes to @entity157 and then calling @entity155 and asking them who owns a certain pair of shoes , " he explained			1
with the information provided by @entity122 , @entity21 has also reached out to the @entity163 company as well as the @entity164			0
" having a definitive answer as to what may have happened in february of 1996 would answer a lot of questions in my mind and others , " @entity1 said			2
" have i found peace ? yes , " she emailed			0
" i even have asked myself what would closure be ? is that something that happens and then you let go of the past ? i hope not			2
my @entity34 is a huge part of who i am			0
" and so @entity1 is left pondering the same questions			0
whose plane did @entity21 's team find and will the wreckage of her father 's plane ever be found ? how the journey began			1

pilot @entity188 disappeared off @entity17 coast in 1996
*daughter* had hoped wreckage would bring closure in father 's disappearance
the recovered *evidence* *suggests* the sunken plane was not @entity188 's
