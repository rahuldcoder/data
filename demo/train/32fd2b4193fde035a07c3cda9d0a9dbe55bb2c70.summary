-- bloody clashes erupted saturday between pro- and @entity3 regime fighters in the @entity5 city of @entity6 , the deadliest outburst of violence in recent weeks and further indication that @entity11 's turmoil is spilling across borders			1
twelve people were killed and approximately 50 were wounded in the latest fighting , according to the state - run @entity15			1
of those hurt , 12 were transported to a hospital in the coastal city , including one in critical condition			1
at one point , a continuous stream of " rocket bombs " hindered national security forces ' attempts to secure the area , the news agency said			0
one rocket exploded over a well - known castle in the city , while another landed some distance away			0
prime minister @entity34 went to @entity6 to assess the security situation , state news reported			1
after meeting with leaders from the different factions involved in the clashes , interior minister @entity36 announced that national security forces will enter the area to enforce a cease - fire set to begin at 5 a.m. sunday			1
anyone who does not abide by the cease - fire " will bear responsibility , " said @entity36 , according to the official news agency			1
the sectarian violence in @entity6 -- which is on the @entity48 coast , about 50 miles from @entity49 in @entity11 -- mirrors the tensions in its neighboring nation			2
clashes in both nations pit @entity54 , who make up the majority of the @entity11 opposition and population , against @entity58 and other @entity59 , who are dominant in president @entity61 's government			1
@entity54 are the majority in northern @entity5 , where @entity6 is located and where @entity64 factions are relatively strong			2
the @entity11 president , meanwhile , has more support in southern @entity5 and among members of the powerful @entity59 militant and political group @entity70 , which is considered a terrorist organization by @entity73 authorities			2
saturday 's fighting is not the first time tensions have simmered over , including in @entity6			0
last month , violence flared after @entity5 authorities arrested @entity80 , an @entity81 activist who was helping @entity11 refugees by providing food and shelter , his cousin said			0
@entity5 had accused @entity80 of being an operative in an @entity87 - inspired group -- something his relatives deny			0
the activist was eventually released , but not before his arrest sparked fighting that killed seven people and left dozens wounded			0
elsewhere in @entity5 , the kidnapping of a group of @entity59 pilgrims in @entity11 prompted angry protests last month in @entity98 , the capital			0
also last month , gun battles in @entity98 between rival political parties -- one supporting @entity11 's @entity61 and one opposing him -- left two dead and 18 wounded			1
that was the worst outbreak of violence in a city where the powerful @entity70 militia engaged government troops in street battles in 2008			0
that bloodshed came hours after @entity5 troops killed two @entity111 clerics -- both opposed to the embattled @entity11 regime -- at a checkpoint in northern @entity5			2
@entity11 has long been a major influence in @entity5 , and not just because of the extensive border the two nations share			0
@entity5 was considered part of " greater @entity11 " until the end of @entity119 @entity11 troops were deployed in @entity5 between 1976 and 2005 , primarily in the north -- ostensibly at first as peacekeepers to help stop @entity5 's long civil war , though they stayed long after the fighting stopped in 1990			1
the @entity11 forces ' 2005 withdrawal followed the car - bomb killing of former prime minister @entity128 in @entity98 , which some blamed on elements of @entity61 's regime			0
since then , @entity5 's most prominent political blocs have been sharply divided -- the ruling pro-syria alliance led by prime minister @entity34 on one side and @entity3 factions led by @entity135 , the son of the assassinated former prime minister , on the other			1
the unrest in @entity11 that began 15 months ago with peaceful anti-government protests , followed by a government crackdown , has meant further complications for @entity5			2
thousands of refugees have poured across the border			0
and in april the @entity5 army announced it had intercepted a cargo ship bound for @entity6 that was filled with weapons it believes were meant to be delivered to rebel forces in @entity11			1
@entity0 's @entity149 and @entity150 contributed to this report .			0

@entity5 's government says it will enforce an agreed - upon cease - fire in the area
