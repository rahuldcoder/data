-- one thing 's missing from the official version of what happened to @entity4 , say some experts and family members : hard evidence			1
@entity9 prime minister @entity8 has said the missing plane 's journey ended in the southern @entity12 , and that the conclusion was based on an analysis of satellite data by a @entity17 company and aviation investigation agency			1
" we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that @entity4 has been lost and that none of those on board survived , " @entity19 told family members of the missing passengers			1
the announcement drew howls of grief			1
but it also provoked skepticism			0
hundreds of friends and family members of passengers marched to the @entity33 in @entity34 tuesday to express their anger and frustration			1
they claimed they were n't being told the truth by the @entity9 government about what happened to the plane after it disappeared from radar on march 8			1
" if you find something : ok , we accept , " said one relative of a passenger			0
" but nothing -- just from the data , just from analysis			0
" ' something from the seas ' " i suppose i want to see something from the seas , " said @entity53 , an @entity12 man whose sister @entity54 was on the plane			1
" i do n't know why i just want to see some debris off the aircraft and the black box to know what exactly happened because there are too many unanswered questions			1
" @entity53 , who has worked for a long time in the @entity12 merchant navy , told @entity0 's @entity65 that he had " sailed those oceans several times myself			0
" @entity68 authorities coordinating the search for the plane in a remote area of the @entity12 suspended efforts on tuesday because of stormy weather			1
@entity53 said he hoped the search would continue			0
" just for the relatives to see that there was something -- and it 's conclusive evidence , " he said			1
@entity80 , whose partner of two years , @entity81 , was on the passenger jet , said in an e-mailed statement that , without confirmed wreckage , the announcement gave her " no real closure			2
" " i still feel his presence , so perhaps it was his soul all along , " she said of @entity81 , one of three @entity88 on the plane			2
' still holding onto hope ' the reactions are understandable , said @entity93 , the founder of @entity94 , an organization that provides grief support to people affected by or involved in air disasters			2
" i think that what we have been hearing is that basically this is n't enough evidence to change the grieving process , " she told @entity0 's @entity99			1
" some people are still holding on to hope and really need more than these words			0
" " they need to see actual parts of the plane and really learn that their loved ones were actually on board by getting some remains back , " said @entity93 , who lost her @entity108 © on @entity109 , which crashed in 1996			2
" i am so glad there is some new information coming to them , " she said of the @entity9 announcement			1
" but really , without anything tangible , they are still going back and forth			2
" @entity9 acting transportation minister @entity121 said tuesday he understood that relatives found it difficult to accept the news without hard evidence			1
" until we can find the debris , and then we can confirm the debris is from @entity4 , it is very difficult for me to have closure for the families , " he said			0
' tantalizingly unsatisfying ' aviation experts also expressed dissatisfaction and frustration with the information			0
" we 've been waiting for the shoe to drop for more than two weeks now			0
and what we got was the most tantalizingly unsatisfying thread of a resolution , " @entity137 , a private pilot and aviation writer , told @entity0			0
@entity0 aviation analyst @entity142 said he wanted to see more information about what was behind @entity9 authorities ' announcement			1
" there is a saying in science : extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence , " he said			2
" the @entity154 government , whose citizens made up about two thirds of the passengers on the plane , says it also wants to know more			1
" we called on the @entity9 side to provide further evidence and all the information , " @entity154 foreign ministry spokesman @entity160 said at a news briefing tuesday			1
portrait of an artist : the @entity169 painter on @entity4 ' nothing is final ' an executive from @entity172 , the @entity17 company that carried out the satellite analysis , said the route into the southern @entity12 was the " best fit " with the pings received from the plane			2
" the most likely route is the south , and the most likely ending in roughly the area where they 're looking now , " @entity178 , a senior vice president at the company , told @entity0 's @entity180			0
" but , of course , nothing is final , " he said			0
" we 're not earth observation satellites , we 're data satellites			0
so it will require a lot of different skills , a lot of different people , not least the naked eye , to finally confirm what happened to 370			2
" @entity178 said the mathematics - based process used by @entity172 and @entity17 's @entity197 was " groundbreaking			2
" the new calculations underwent a peer review process with space agency experts and contributions by @entity203 , he said			2
@entity204 , an aviation attorney , said he was troubled by the different language used by the satellite company and @entity9 officials			1
" on the one hand , you have the executive from @entity172 saying ' most likely ' and somehow that got booted up to ' beyond reasonable doubt			0
' i do n't agree with that , " @entity204 said			0
" i am not convinced that they are certain where this airplane is , " he said			0
" i think they have fine - tuned it to a general area , but to say beyond a reasonable doubt this plane went down where they are saying is a stretch			0
" @entity9 defends announcement prime minister @entity8 on tuesday defended the decision to make the announcement , saying it was based on " the most conclusive information we have			1
" he told @entity230 he did n't want the government to be seen as hiding information on purpose from the families of the missing passengers -- an accusation @entity9 authorities faced earlier in the investigation into the plane 's disappearance			1
he noted that more answers would only come to light with the discovery of the plane 's flight data recorder			0
" we can not verify any theories until the black box is found , " he said			0
search for @entity4 : the technology how ' groundbreaking ' number crunching found path of @entity4 ' they have told us all lives are lost , ' says relative of @entity19 passenger @entity0 's @entity258 and journalist @entity259 contributed to this report .			0
