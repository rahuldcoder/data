-- @entity1 endured losing one of her sons to cystic fibrosis before he could get a lung transplant			1
now she 's hoping her younger boy , @entity6 , 11 , will get such an operation in time			2
" this is like watching movie that you 've seen before and you want a different ending , " @entity1 told @entity0 on saturday			1
" it 's hard for me to tell my son ' you have to have faith and be hopeful , you know this is going to happen for you , ' and inside knowing that chances are slim			0
" a judge on thursday made @entity6 , from @entity19 , @entity20 , more quickly eligible for adult lungs			1
the boy is hospitalized at @entity23			0
judge @entity24 granted a temporary injunction and ordered @entity27 secretary @entity26 to direct the @entity28 to waive in @entity6 's case a policy that keeps children younger than 12 from being prioritized for available adult lung transplants			2
@entity1 ' son , @entity33 , died in 2009 at 11			1
@entity6 also has cystic fibrosis			0
the ruling came the same day the judge granted an injunction for 10 - year - old @entity38 , whose parents ' push for an organ transplant policy change has thrust the issue of who gets donated organs into the national spotlight			1
@entity38 also needs a lung transplant			2
@entity1 said she was " excited " after hearing the news of the the ruling in @entity6 's case			2
" i felt it was a triumph on our side because it allows these children to have an opportunity to be considered for adult lungs , which they need badly , instead of just waiting it out , " she said			1
" we do n't know what tomorrow brings			0
" according to @entity38 and @entity1 's attorney , @entity58 , the @entity28 is expected to consider monday evening the families ' requests that the " under 12 " rule -- which places children under age 12 at the bottom of the organ allocation list -- be struck down			1
currently , it is estimated that 16 or fewer children nationwide are in the same position as @entity38 and @entity6 , @entity58 said			0
if the rule is not struck down , a formal court hearing on the matter is scheduled for june 14			0
" if @entity73 does not receive this transplant , he will die , " @entity1 said			0
" like any parent , i 'm inclined to do whatever it takes , to help @entity6 have a normal life , whatever that may be			0
