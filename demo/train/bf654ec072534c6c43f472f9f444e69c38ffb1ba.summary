@entity0 -- as the @entity6 this week casts its first round of votes on immigration reform , a divided @entity3 conference on the other side of the @entity5 may be a roadblock to any immigration measure passing @entity12 this year			1
and that internal split will soon pose a critical test for @entity16 speaker @entity15			1
one side of the divide was clear during a closed meeting last week among @entity16 and @entity6 conservatives -- the first time they 've sat down to talk about a comprehensive immigration reform plan that includes a path to citizenship for undocumented workers			1
immigration reform clears key @entity6 hurdle two of the @entity6 's @entity29 " members -- @entity30 of @entity31 and @entity32 of @entity33 , who are pushing the @entity6 's bipartisan plan -- faced off with well over 100 @entity3 members of the conservative @entity36 ( @entity36 )			1
@entity30 is considered key to bringing conservatives on board , and @entity32 used to be a member of the @entity36			0
@entity40 : @entity30 's wild immigration ride the meeting only seemed to harden conservative opposition			0
@entity30 distances self from immigration plan he helped draft @entity48 rep. @entity47 summed up the reaction of many @entity16 @entity48 members who attended the session , telling @entity1 those senators explaining the merits of that plan " were doing their best to put lipstick on a pig			2
" @entity59 rep. @entity58 , a leading conservative , told reporters it was " highly unlikely " the majority of @entity63 would vote for a bill similar to the @entity6 deal that permits citizenship after a series of conditions are met because he and @entity48 colleagues do n't trust the @entity71 administration to enforce the laws currently on the books			1
@entity74 backs gang of eight immigration plan @entity16 plan on the rocks while many @entity16 conservatives agree immigration reform is a critical priority for @entity12 , they part with president @entity71 , @entity82 , and some in their own party who believe allowing eventual citizenship to those in the country illegally is part of the solution			1
they vow that they wo n't support any bill that adds to the deficit and they want to see a tougher approach to border security			0
5 things you should know about immigration reform but there is a bloc of @entity16 @entity48 members -- including 2012 vice presidential candidate @entity100 of @entity101 -- that is pushing for a similar bipartisan approach that the @entity6 is taking up this week , which includes a path to citizenship			1
the group represents a minority within the @entity16 @entity48 conference			0
that bipartisan effort suffered a significant setback last week			0
a working group , similar to the @entity6 's " @entity111 , " has been on the verge of unveiling legislation for months , according to multiple sources			2
but rep. @entity115 , one of the four @entity48 members in the group , abruptly dropped out			0
like @entity30 , who is needed to attract @entity3 votes in the @entity6 , reform backers hoped @entity120 would play the same role in the @entity16			2
@entity120 was frustrated he could n't get support for his detailed proposal laying out how undocumented workers in the @entity125 would be barred from any taxpayer - funded health care benefits			0
@entity120 leaves @entity16 bipartisan immigration group @entity115 told @entity1 his decision to leave the group and @entity30 's call to add tougher border security measures to the @entity6 bill " means maybe what we 'll get is real immigration reform with conservative ideals that most @entity125 want			1
" @entity16 immigration talks foundering @entity31 rep @entity138 , who is still part of the group and has been involved in immigration negotiations for more four years , tried to downplay @entity120 's exit , praising him and saying " this has always been a very difficult issue , " and said he remained committed to pushing ahead			2
@entity15 repeatedly stresses that he supports the work of the @entity16 bipartisan group , but he wo n't weigh in on any policy details			1
he has vowed any legislation would follow " regular order , " meaning any bill will go through committees			0
' a special path to citizenship is very problematic ' after backlash from many of his rank and file members for cutting " backroom deals " on the debt ceiling and other issues , the speaker wants time to educate his members on immigration reform and gain some buy - in for any bill or set of bills			2
that approach means @entity171 chairman @entity170 of @entity172 will wield significant power in the coming weeks			0
@entity170 disagrees with the @entity82 ' strategy to move one comprehensive bill , saying he prefers to move a series of discrete immigration measures through his committee			0
@entity170 has focused his attention on the border security and employer verification aspects of reform and told reporters he has major concerns with moving legislation that sets up a process eventually allowing those already in the @entity125 illegally to become citizens			0
" a special path to citizenship is very problematic " @entity170 said			0
@entity71 : no one will get everything in immigration reform given the internal divisions @entity15 has been careful not to signal whether he will move immigration in one package or allow votes on separate bills			2
but the speaker appears to be prodding his members to get moving			0
he told reporters at his weekly news conference last week he expected the @entity203 panel to have " some vehicles " to move by the end of the month			0
reform advocates worry that if the @entity16 breaks up any comprehensive bill and moves it in pieces it could kill momentum for immigration this year , but the process is important so that @entity15 can say the @entity16 has input and @entity82 are open to different options			1
when immigration efforts shift to the @entity16 it 's notable that the political dynamic is much different that it is in the @entity6			1
after @entity218 went overwhelmingly for @entity71 in the 2012 election , many @entity3 conceded the party needed to soften its stance and back legalization for undocumented workers this year to attract more @entity225 support			0
many @entity6 @entity3 feel pressure in states with high @entity225 populations to reverse their previous opposition to comprehensive immigration reform , or else suffer major losses among minority voters			2
but @entity16 districts have become more solidly red and blue after redistricting so there is less concern among most @entity63 that opposing immigration reform would hurt their chances at re-election			1
if the @entity6 passes legislation with a significant bipartisan vote there will be intense pressure on @entity15 to act			1
he and other top @entity16 @entity48 leaders recognize passing major immigration legislation helps their party 's long - term electoral prospects and could be a major issue in recapturing the @entity249 in 2016			2
but the speaker risks antagonizing many of his members by proceeding with a bill that would ultimately need a majority of @entity255 votes to pass			0
how @entity15 decides to proceed with immigration in the @entity16 could affect his political fortunes			1
@entity47 gave a warning to @entity15 as he considers the next step , telling @entity1 , " if the speaker allows a vote on any immigration bill that results in the passage despite a majority of the @entity3 conference voting against it , then it will be interesting to see if he can muster the votes to get re-elected after the next election			1

conservatives oppose any plan with path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants
@entity15 could be *straddling* divide if @entity6 passes bipartisan immigration bill
@entity16 conservatives see no pressure to pass bill because of they represent solidly red districts
@entity15 's future *threatened* if he allows vote on bill that conservatives will *reject*
