-- " i 've always only been interested in trying to make people laugh , " @entity0 told @entity2 , " and trying to be funny and make things that would have made me laugh , you know ? or my brothers laugh , or my sisters laugh , or my parents laugh			1
that 's always been the motivation for me			2
" the host of @entity13 's ( sister station to @entity1 ) " @entity11 " is a guest on tonight 's " @entity15			1
" " it starts with the family , " @entity0 told the @entity1 host			1
" i 'm from a large @entity20 - @entity19 family and trying , the benchmark , for me , is trying to make my dad laugh or trying to make my brothers laugh at the table when we were having meals together			1
" the third of six children , @entity0 and his two older brothers , one younger brother and two younger sisters grew up in the @entity32 suburb of @entity33 , @entity34			1
@entity0 , 49 , who began doing @entity36 impersonations in the third grade , recalled wanting to take tap dance lessons as a child in the 1970s			1
" i grew up on old movies , " explained @entity0 , who said he loved gangster movies and the films of @entity42			1
when " @entity44 " was released in 1974 , the young @entity0 was convinced he had to know how to tap dance in order to make it in show business			1
" it 's showing you what entertainment is , " recalled @entity0			1
" i thought , like an idiot in the 1970s , that that was what entertainers needed to have to know			2
you have to be like @entity57 or @entity58			0
you 've got to know how to sing , dance , move			0
you 've got to know how to do it all			0
" @entity0 said that his mother , a lawyer , and his father , a microbiologist , thought he was bluffing , but encouraged him to follow his dream nonetheless			1
" they found me this really old @entity69 - @entity68 gentleman , " said @entity0 , " who had been the @entity71 " bojangles " @entity72			1
and he ... worked out of this dilapidated studio and taught all these ... people how to dance			0
i was the only white kid there ... not only that , i was tiny and i had bright orange hair ... so all these beautiful black women are learning jazz , tap and all this kind of stuff and then i would march in with my box of tiny shoes ... " when @entity2 pointed out that @entity0 does n't possess the " agony " and the " torment " that plagues a lot of successful comics , the " @entity11 " host admitted that he has always grappled with insecurity			2
" i was always a very hard - working student and wanted to go to a good school and worked really hard to go to a good school , " said @entity0 , who attended @entity91			2
" and then when i got there , i immediately had the fear that a lot of people have , which is , i do n't belong here			0
these other people know a lot more than i do			0
and i think that is the common denominator that you see with a lot of people , whether they 're artists or performers			0
they do n't think that they belong			0
" getting into comedy , @entity0 said , " was a very beautiful accident , because i worked very hard at everything and i tried really hard			1
comedy was something that i stumbled into when i was in college			1
" @entity0 soon began writing for the college humor magazine			1
" it was like falling off a log and discovering what it is that i was meant to do , " he said			0
" after @entity91 , @entity0 moved to @entity122 and landed a sketch comedy writing gig with the then - fledgling @entity125			1
the show he was writing for flopped , but @entity0 was hired shortly thereafter as a writer for " @entity128			1
" after " snl , " @entity11 struck out on his own and wrote an original sitcom			0
the pilot fared terribly in the ratings			0
@entity0 then wrote for " @entity132 " before being selected to take over @entity134 's spot at @entity136 's " @entity135 " in 1993			1
@entity0 's string of successes and failures were the basis of his 2000 @entity91 commencement address			1
" i 've looked good , i 've looked bad , i 've been praised , i 've been criticized , " his speech read , " but my mistakes have been necessary			0
i 've dwelled on my failure today , because as a graduate of @entity91 , your biggest liability is your need to succeed , your need to always find yourself on the sweet side of the bell curve			0
success is a lot like a bright white tuxedo			0
you feel terrific when you get it , but then you 're desperately afraid of getting it dirty , of spoiling it			0
" back in 2004 , @entity0 had negotiated a contract with @entity136 to take over " @entity160 " from @entity159 in 2009			2
" @entity160 with @entity0 " debuted on june 1 , 2009			2
but in january 2010 , @entity136 announced that @entity159 would begin hosting " the @entity161 " at 11:35 p.m. , thus pushing " @entity160 's " start time to 12:05 a.m. unhappy with this plan , @entity0 struck a deal with @entity136 that permitted him to leave " @entity160 , " which @entity159 again took over			1
this freed @entity0 up to negotiate with other networks , and he went to @entity13			1
" @entity11 " debuted on november 8 , 2010 and airs weeknights at 11			0
" i 'm honestly happier now ... this feels ... like a greater achievement ... because i 'm doing exactly the show i want to do			2
i 'm doing it with people that i love			2
and we get to do it our way , and we 're with these amazing partners at @entity176			0
" @entity0 and @entity159 have not spoken since the " @entity160 " fallout			2
" i just think life throws you a lot of curveballs , " said @entity0 , " and this is something that i did n't agree with , and i thought it was pretty screwed up , but we , everyone went through it			2
there was this sort of collective feeling about what happened			0
and then you move on from it			0
