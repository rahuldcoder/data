@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is poised to follow in his father 's footsteps and become @entity1 's next prime minister , a position he said he " will not shy away from			1
" @entity3 said he will discuss taking the position of @entity1 's prime minister with his allies			1
" i will discuss it with my allies , " the pro- @entity13 @entity12 lawmaker told @entity2			2
" you know , i did n't win this election by myself			0
my allies had a big role to play in winning for the 14th of march ( coalition )			1
and i think it will only be fair and obvious that we talk , me and my allies ... and then after that , if i have to do it , i will not shy away from it			0
" @entity3 is the head of the " march 14 " coalition , which retained its control over @entity1 's government this week despite a strong challenge from a @entity29 - dominated alliance			1
@entity3 said he hopes to accomplish what his father , former prime minister @entity30 , never had a chance to do before he was killed in 2005			1
" he accomplished in his assassination the sovereignty of @entity1 , the independence of @entity1 , " @entity3 said			2
" and i want to accomplish what he always dreamt of @entity1 being			0
" i think he would want me to do what 's good for @entity1 , do what would unite the @entity1 people , and ... concentrate on the economy and the security and stability of @entity1			2
" the elder @entity3 was killed in a massive bombing in february 2005 that also left 22 others dead			2
an ongoing @entity47 investigation has found indications of @entity50 involvement in the assassination of the popular statesman , but @entity50 has denied any role			0
his death triggered massive protests that eventually led to the withdrawal of @entity50 forces , ending @entity50 's occupation of @entity1			0
@entity3 said sunday 's vote " was about @entity1 " and not its precarious position between its alliances with @entity63 countries and its @entity65 neighbors			1
" the people who went on the 7th of june voted for @entity1 first , " he said			0
" it 's not about the @entity68 ; it 's not about @entity70 ; it 's not about @entity50			0
it 's about we as @entity1 , what we want from this new parliament and from this new government that 's going to come			0
" @entity3 ruled out an independent peace track with @entity78 , sticking by his previous assessment that @entity1 will be the last country to sign a peace deal with the jewish state			1
" we will follow after the @entity65 initiative , " he said			0
" you see , the @entity65 initiative includes many countries for the peace process , and @entity1 will come as we see fit			0
" @entity78 fought a war against @entity29 militants in @entity1 three years ago that is widely regarded as having empowered the @entity90 militia , which claimed victory in the six - week conflict			1
some analysts had feared that a @entity29 victory in this week 's parliamentary elections would have heightened tensions in the @entity97 , particularly because of the estimated 30,000 rockets pointed at @entity78 from southern @entity1 , all under the control of @entity29 militants			1
@entity3 met tuesday with president @entity100 , who is in @entity0 with more than 200 international observers monitoring the election			2
shortly before that meeting , @entity3 said the @entity13 will play a key role in the effort to attain peace in the @entity97			1
" i think the biggest turning point in this peace process is what the @entity13 will do , " he said			2
" the @entity13 has a big role to play , and if it plays it in the right way , if it plays its role like it should play it , then we will have peace in the region			1
they should pressure both sides to move forward -- whether the @entity119 and the @entity78 , whether the @entity50 and the @entity78 -- and i 'm sure we 'll get there			0
" after the victory of @entity3 's coalition , the next step for @entity1 lawmakers will be to elect a speaker of the parliament			1
then , @entity1 president @entity127 will ask someone -- presumably @entity3 -- to form a government			2
in @entity1 , the presidency is reserved for @entity131 , the speaker of parliament is always a @entity90 , and the prime minister is a @entity134			0
that system was created to balance power among @entity1 's three main religious groups .			0

@entity3 hopes to finish what his father , @entity30 , never had a chance to do
@entity3 's coalition retained control this week despite challenge from @entity29 alliance
