@entity0 , @entity1 -- hundreds of @entity4 militants were among the prisoners freed from a notorious @entity0 prison this week , according to a former @entity1 jihadist			1
the freed militants had been imprisoned in @entity0 's @entity10 prison by @entity12 's regime during the height of the insurgency in @entity15 , according to @entity16 , once a senior figure in the @entity18			1
@entity16 said he believes as many as 600 militants may have been among the prison population at @entity10			0
it 's not known how many prisoners were held in the vast facility			2
@entity24 said @entity12 's prisons " have been filled to the limit in the last few months with thousands of people who were arrested for taking part in the @entity30 protests , or because of their suspected support for @entity1 's democratic opposition			1
" the human rights group , which recently had a team visit the prison , estimates that before the uprising , there were a few hundred @entity40 held at @entity10			2
@entity16 said many of the militants released are pro-al @entity43			1
" nobody knows what these released prisoners are going to do next , " he said			0
" will they take part in the fighting and if they do will they join pre-existing rebel brigades or form a separate fighting force ? " @entity16 , now a senior analyst at the @entity55 in @entity56 , said the freed prisoners are @entity58 , embracing a puritanical interpretation of @entity40 that has gained ground in @entity1 in recent years			1
@entity12 's regime imprisoned thousands of suspected pro-al @entity43 militants after the 2003 @entity65 invasion of @entity15 stoked radicalization in @entity1 , especially in its impoverished eastern provinces			1
according to @entity16 , those rounded up by the regime included militants who had tried to travel to @entity15 and some who had returned from fighting against @entity65 forces there			2
he said many of them had already been released by the @entity12 regime			1
@entity43 in @entity15 records seized by the @entity65 military in 2007 indicated that proportionately more @entity1 traveled to fight with @entity43 in @entity15 than from any other @entity80 country			1
some saw fighting in @entity15 as a " a last act of defiance against the @entity12 regime , " according to a confidential 2008 @entity85 cable made public by the website @entity86 , because of the rapprochement at the time between @entity12 and the @entity65			1
wednesday 's prison release , which occurred as rebel forces took control of the @entity10 area of @entity0 , comes as @entity40 are taking on an increasingly prominent role in the fight against the @entity12 regime -- to the concern of some in the @entity97			1
former members of the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) have assumed leadership positions in several rebel brigades , according to @entity16			0
their current prominence , he said , was due to their quick mobilization -- as armed opposition replaced peaceful protests in @entity1 -- and their valued military skills			2
the former leader of the @entity18 , @entity106 , now commands one of the most powerful rebel brigades in @entity0 , according to @entity16 and , according to reports , took charge of successful rebel efforts earlier this week to storm @entity12 's @entity113 compound , further bolstering his prominent position in rebel ranks			1
@entity106 was a well - known figure in the jihadist movement			0
he fought the @entity119 - backed government in @entity120 and helped found the @entity18 there			0
in the mid- 1990s the @entity18 conducted a deadly campaign of attacks on @entity1 security services , before a crackdown largely constrained the group 's ability to operate inside the country			1
after the fall of the @entity129 , @entity106 fled @entity120 to @entity130 and was eventually arrested in @entity131 in 2004			0
according to @entity16 , he was then held and interrogated by the @entity132 before being transferred to @entity1 where he was held in @entity10 until his release in march 2010			2
but @entity106 has now become a powerful voice against @entity43 's terrorism , according to @entity16 , who says that @entity106 always resisted requests by @entity137 for his @entity1 group to join forces with @entity43			1
in 2009 , @entity106 and other senior @entity18 leaders formally repudiated @entity43 style terrorism and disbanded their campaign to overthrow the @entity1 regime			1
the breakthrough was the result of a two - year dialogue with the regime brokered by @entity16			0
@entity2 interviewed leading figures of the @entity18 in @entity10 in @entity0 in september 2009 , shortly before the group 's leaders were released			1
although they were then behind prison bars , the leaders ' disavowal of violence appeared genuine			0
@entity16 says that former @entity18 members who have again taken up arms have fused their efforts with rebel forces and do not operate as a separate armed group			0
instead they have created a new political organization called the @entity161 , which @entity16 says is committed to working within a future democratic process			0
he says other @entity4 units are operating in @entity1 but does not know of any former members of his group who are fighting with them			2
@entity16 says that it will be important for the @entity168 to keep a close watch over the militants released from @entity10 jail -- especially if they begin operating as a group outside the @entity168 chain of command			0
according to @entity16 , the presence of former @entity18 leaders in rebel ranks like @entity177 may help prevent this happening			0
@entity18 members and the younger generation of @entity58 jihadists were often incarcerated in the same wing of @entity10			0
@entity16 believes the presence of former @entity18 commanders in rebel front lines will enhance their credibility amongst the released prisoners			0
but he says some among the younger generation of jihadists have already begun operating outside the orbit of the @entity168			0
in the east , where radicalization has historically run highest , young @entity58 jihadists have linked up with foreign militants and may even have started their own training camps to train volunteers to fight the @entity12 regime , according to @entity16			1
a number of jihadists , he says , have entered @entity1 from other @entity80 countries			0
in june , the @entity168 detained two suspected @entity201 jihadists in @entity202 in eastern @entity1 and expelled them , according to @entity16			2
neighboring @entity203 , which waged a long battle against @entity4 insurgents in the 1990s , has already expressed concern about the instability in @entity1 being exploited by @entity208 and other jihadist groups			2
@entity203 officials are also concerned that weapons such as ground - to - air missiles may have fallen into militant hands , a worry that has also been expressed by @entity65 commanders .			0
