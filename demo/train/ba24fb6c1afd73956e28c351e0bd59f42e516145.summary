-- @entity2 's 2010 graduating class owed a total of more than $ 600 million in student loans			1
it 's unlikely the university will forgive them			0
but @entity2 has forgiven portions of mortgages they have extended to president @entity11 , other university executives or star faculty -- money that has been used to buy properties in @entity16 or vacation homes in the @entity18			1
does this shock you ? or , how about this : treasury secretary @entity22 , a former executive vice president at @entity2 , received an " exit bonus " of $ 685,000			1
just to put this in perspective , @entity22 's @entity2 exit bonus alone would have provided free tuition for 34 undergraduates			1
the revelations about lavish compensation packages at @entity2 ( my alma mater ) have raised a firestorm of criticism			1
faculty critics have already publicized @entity2 's top executive salaries : @entity11 takes home nearly $ 1.5 million , @entity38 , the vice dean of science gets $ 1.1 million , and @entity40 , the dean of the medical center , makes a whopping $ 3.5 million			1
and , as @entity43 reported in the @entity44 , sometimes the salaries do n't stop when the job ends			1
exit bonuses and forgivable mortgages on townhouses , condos and vacation homes not only allow these top dogs to meet the standard of living of the 1 % , but also to sock away real estate profits and rental income for the future			1
as it turns out , @entity2 also makes some of these payments off the official university books through a series of nonprofit foundations			2
in some cases , the university has written second mortgages -- also forgivable -- on property already purchased through the foundations			0
sure , other universities have found ways to woo high - level executives , faculty and coaches with big salaries , severance pay , cars and real estate			2
for example , the @entity76 has maintained a @entity78 similar to those at @entity2			2
it provided mortgages and other forms of compensation , doled out over time , to encourage faculty to remain at the university			0
these practices , and the secrecy surrounding them , are under investigation by the @entity90 attorney general 's office			0
but @entity2 is in the media spotlight because giving loans to university executives and stars to purchase vacation homes is nearly unheard of , according to some experts			1
is the university setting precedent for a new kind of extravagant spending ? in january 2012 , vice president @entity100 carelessly -- and incorrectly -- remarked that high faculty salaries were driving escalating college tuition			2
this is a popular blame - game among politicians and university administrators alike			0
but according to the @entity106 , in 2012 full - time faculty at all ranks across the nation received an average increase of 1.8 %			0
in real dollars , this was the equivalent of lowering salaries by 1.2 %			0
in comparison to a decade ago , @entity106 salary data shows the rate of increase in faculty raises barely budged			0
in faculty lounges , the phrase " corporate university " is used to describe the negative ways that higher education , including the conditions under which the majority of faculty is employed , has been shaped by the business practices that trustees steeped in the culture of @entity129 bring to the campus			1
the corporate university eliminates full - time teaching jobs whenever possible			0
it relies on temporary academic laborers who have few or no benefits and median salaries of $ 2,700 per course , salary stagnation for the majority of academic and nonacademic employees , the reduction or elimination of union jobs , and the outsourcing of essential services to corporate providers who pay minimum wage or less			0
these changes have been accompanied by the creation of massive endowments			0
@entity2 's endowment was reported at $ 2.755 billion in 2012			2
this is only the 24th largest private endowment in the @entity153			0
i remember a time when administrators were called deans , provosts , treasurers and registrars -- now it seems everybody is a vice president			0
with these titles have come higher salaries , bonuses , company cars , low - interest mortgages and severance payments for voluntary departures			0
boards of trustees approve these lavish practices even as they fight unionization , eliminate full - time faculty positions , refuse even cost - of - living raises for the majority of workers , increase tuition and ask students and their parents to take out tens of thousands of dollars in loans			2
what kind of bookkeeping permits contemporary universities to call themselves nonprofits when they are creating significant profits that go toward benefiting the financial aspirations of a few elite employees ? the investigation into @entity2 should pry open the door to a world of accumulation and mismanagement in universities			1
higher education is in need of ethical and fiscal reform , but it ca n't happen unless we start at the top			1
editor 's note : an earlier version of this essay misstated how much free tuition @entity22 's exit bonus would have provided for undergraduates at @entity2			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			2

a @entity44 *article* revealed that @entity2 executives are given loans for buying vacation homes
@entity208 : this practice is nearly unheard of in higher education , according to experts
she says instead of helping elite employees financially , universities should lower tuition
@entity208 : the @entity2 news should pry open the door to a world of mismanagement in universities
