@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's education system is beginning to battle back from years of neglect and an exodus of teachers			1
from a distance the @entity8 school looks to be in an ok condition			0
but many parents still find it impossible to pay the @entity13 $ 24 a year fees and some resort to using chickens as payment			1
the country 's education minister in the year - old power - sharing administration believes it could be decade before standards are back up to @entity1 's good past record			1
when president @entity24 took office in 1980 , he prioritized education			1
his government managed to lift @entity1 's adult literacy rate to one of the highest on the continent			1
but like everything else @entity24 achieved during his first decade in power , he has in the past few years managed to undo			2
the government stopped funding some schools as far back as 1999 , and as the economy crumbled so too did the quality of learning			2
according to the education department , 20,000 teachers have left the country in the past two years and half of @entity1 's children have not progressed beyond primary school			1
many parents today are too poor to send their children to school			1
rural schools -- where pencils , desks and books are luxuries -- are hardest hit			0
watch kids trying to learn when @entity2 visited a @entity8 primary school in @entity55 , in the southwest of @entity1 , headmaster @entity53 said that at one point teachers used charcoal as a substitute for chalk			1
" there are no textbooks to talk about at the moment because i remember the last text books were bought sometime in 2000 or so , when we were still getting government grants but now we do n't have anything			0
" those text books have reached their shelf life			0
an aid organization donated 32 text books which we really appreciated and we are using those text books right across the grades , trying to impart knowledge to the kids			2
" in a school with 406 children , that means that almost 13 children have to share one text book			0
" so what we normally do is write problems on the board and the children read , this is what we are doing in a bid to ensure that children learn , " @entity53 adds			0
the families of some children are so poor they can not afford the reduced fees of @entity13 $ 2 a year -- only a quarter of the children have the funds			2
some parents have even resorted to paying fees in chickens and other life stock			2
@entity53 said : " when the parents bring a chicken to sell or to offer as school levy , teachers sometimes buy it , so if they agree on the price , the teacher would get the item , pay the fees , and then if there is any change , he would give the parent the change			1
" education minister @entity112 says he inherited a catastrophic system when he took over in february			1
" seven thousand government schools were closed and most of the 80,000 teachers were on strike			2
at the head office building there was no water in our 18 - storey building and the toilets were in a mess			2
that was emblematic of the state of schools , " he told @entity2			0
@entity2 asked the headmaster at @entity8 about the children 's concentration level and trying to learn under such difficult circumstances			2
" we have children who are excelling even though they are sitting on the floor , so that is why we are hoping if things normalize these children may be the best in the world , " he said proudly			0
@entity53 is one of the teachers who did not join the exodus			0
" in any normal situation when others go out , definitely others have to remain			0
there is no way we can all of us just go out			0
" those who are remaining , we are just hoping that things will be better			0
it is not because things are better for us but we just feel we need to teach these kids ... to become something in the world			1
" @entity1 's unity government has managed to get some striking teachers back into classrooms by offering them an improved wage of $ 150 a month , but that is hardly a living wage			1
" if you can pay your rent , pay your bills here and there and then you are able to come back to school			0
we just do that , " @entity53 says			0
" we can not all go out and leave @entity1 empty without teachers			1
those who are outside understand that we are playing a significant role because some of them left their kids behind			1
they definitely know they are being taken care of , we are teaching them			0
" the education minister said he was allocated one - tenth of the budget he needs to rebuild @entity1 's education system			1
he is hoping donors will come to his country 's aid			0
according to his estimates , it could take up to 10 years to get @entity1 's education system to where it was in the early 90 's			1
and he understands that he will only be able to achieve this if he can retain committed civil servants like @entity53 .			0

in two years , 20,000 teachers have left @entity1
*desperately* poor parents sometimes pay for education with livestock
@entity1 's education system suffered as the economy went into *freefall*
head teacher : we need to teach these kids ... to become something in the world
