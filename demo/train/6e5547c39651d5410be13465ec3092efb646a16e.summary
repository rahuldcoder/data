@entity0 -- the " shutter shades " most recently popularized by fashion - conscious rapper @entity11 are in the midst of a transformation from flash - in - the - pan style accessory to a clever technological learning aid that its makers hope will encourage more people to learn the art of computer coding			0
the @entity12 contains a pair of glasses made entirely of circuit board and dotted with 174 @entity16 's tacked onto the front			2
" you can control each individual led , " explains @entity18 , co-founder of @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , the @entity0 based start - up behind the idea			1
the small array can display scrolling text , videos of flickering flames or generate any moving image that the user desires			0
" @entity12 is our mission to convince people to learn how to program , " says @entity18 , who expects that as more everyday items develop the capacity to send and receive data -- a trend sometimes referred to as the " @entity33 " -- the more important it will be that we know how to operate and adapt them			1
@entity19 are following in the footsteps of @entity39 , the $ 25 computer designed to encourage children to learn to code			0
but the flashing lights of the @entity12 is an added incentive : learn code , and look cool in the process			2
" without the incentive we do n't have a convincing argument , so we thought let 's create ( one ) , " says @entity18			1
importantly , users can choose how far they want to delve into the code , ranging from an introdcutory level drag - and - drop interface to full , line - by - line coding			0
as technology creeps inexorably into every crevice of our lives , a rudimentary understanding of computer code is seen by some as an essential life skill			2
for @entity62 , co-founder of @entity63 , an interactive online resource that teaches programming , it has become as important as learning to read			1
" coding is 21st century literacy , " says @entity62			2
" with an economy in flux and a world in which everything is increasingly becoming revolutionized by technology , programming is becoming a core part of job competency			1
even knowing basic programming and algorithms helps you throughout everyday life			1
" unlike most products on the high street , @entity12 is built to be modified			0
as it is made entirely out of circuit board , users can solder components directly to it -- such as a light dependent resistor or a microphone to make it respond to sound			0
" one of the first things people asked was if it could react to music			0
so we added a microphone as an added incentive , " says @entity18			1
@entity19 describe themselves as a " haberdashery for technology and education dedicated to helping people produce and not just consume technology			2
" @entity12 is their latest piece of kit seeking to fill the gap between the technology we own and what we know about how it works			2
" we all realize at some point that we want to make the things in life that we care about , " says @entity18			1
" we do n't actually want microwavable tv dinners -- we care about food			0
food is just one example of that maker revolution			2
" @entity18 thinks the growth of interactive new media has encouraged a move away from 20th century - style consumerism			1
" @entity121 was a big precipitating factor in that , " he says			0
" all of a sudden people were not just consuming media , but creating it			0
" this so - called " maker movement " has been credited with heralding a new industrial revolution , with community - run @entity127 workshops , often known as hackspaces , gaining increasing popularity			1
" we do see ourselves as part of the maker revolution , " says @entity18			1
" i think hackspaces are phenomenal , but they 're servicing a very small community			0
if you 're someone from the outside looking in , it can be a very frightening space			0
we 're not at all like that			0
" @entity18 reckons his kit is more approachable , targeted at an entry level tinkerer : " it 's really about opening the doorway to the world of technology and understanding what it is			1
it 's about giving people just enough , and making it easy enough , to tantalize them to jump in , and hopefully start swimming			0
" @entity19 spoke at a " makers " event in @entity0 last week alongside the creators of @entity156 , local heroes of the maker revolution			0
@entity18 thinks the movement is gaining momentum : " we are part of this wave that is building			1
the maker revolution is like a paradigm shift in your own head			1

the @entity169 led glasses teaches you basic programming , and makes you look cool too .
@entity18 , founder of technology will save us talks with @entity1 about his educational kits and his philosophy .
programming is as important today as literacy ; the maker movement is a " paradigm shift " in thinking .
