-- three men who were convicted of killing three @entity3 16 years ago will have their cases reviewed in a court hearing to see whether they should be granted a new trial , the @entity1 ruled thursday			1
@entity7 , @entity7 and @entity7 were convicted in the 1993 deaths of 8 - year - olds @entity9 , @entity7 and @entity11			1
the boys ' bruised and mutilated bodies were found in may 1993 in @entity14 , @entity15 , their arms and legs hogtied with their own shoelaces			1
the court thursday remanded the cases back to the lower court			1
the ruling means @entity23 , @entity7 and @entity24 will be able to present new evidence that could exonerate them			2
@entity23 ' attorneys said at a hearing in september that they want to present dna evidence not available at the time of the trial , as well as testimony that supports arguments that @entity23 and the two others are innocent			1
" we are very pleased that the @entity1 ordered a new evidentiary hearing to review the convincing evidence of the innocence of @entity7 , @entity7 and @entity7 , " @entity23 spokesman @entity35 said			1
" these young men were convicted of a brutal crime someone else committed , and we hope the state moves quickly to overturn their convictions and seek to prosecute those responsible			1
" the case , known as the @entity7 , has gained advocates including some of the victims ' parents			0
@entity49 , @entity11 's mother , said last year that she was once convinced of their guilt but began to consider the dna evidence and believes the prosecution 's case was flawed			1
" we are asking the @entity1 to right a terrible wrong , overturn their convictions and grant @entity57 as well as @entity7 and @entity7 a new trial , " said @entity55 , the lead attorney on the case , in september			2
the @entity1 , in its ruling , said that the circuit court erroneously interpreted the @entity15 dna testing laws and that the three should have been granted an evidentiary hearing			1
testing of the dna in question was conducted between december 2005 and september 2007 , according to the @entity1			1
the material included hair from a ligature used to bind @entity9 and a hair recovered from a tree stump near where the bodies were found , court documents said			2
the hair found in the ligature was consistent with @entity11 's stepfather , @entity76 , while the hair found on the tree stump was consistent with the dna of a friend of @entity49 ' , according to the documents			2
police have never considered @entity49 a suspect , and @entity49 maintains that he had nothing to do with the murders			2
@entity23 received a death sentence for the slayings , while @entity7 and @entity24 were sentenced to life in prison			0
now 35 , @entity23 said in september , " i miss the things that most people take for granted , things people do n't want , like rain			0
" @entity23 wrote in his 2005 autobiography , " @entity94 , " that police questioned him a day after the bodies of the second - graders were found			0
the teens -- @entity23 was 19 at the time , @entity7 was 16 , and @entity24 was 17 -- were arrested a month later			0
prosecutors successfully argued that the defendants were involved in a satanic cult and that punctures and cuts on the boys ' bodies indicated a ritual sacrifice			0
in addition , prosecutors secured a confession from @entity111 , although his defense attorneys argued that he had a learning disability and an iq of 70			0
they also claimed the confession was coerced , with neither @entity24 's parents nor an attorney present , and riddled with inconsistencies			0
a @entity119 , @entity15 - based group trying to raise awareness about the @entity7 case has brought in celebrities such as singer @entity123 and actor @entity124 to a recent public rally			0
@entity0 's @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity1 sent the cases back for a hearing
