-- recent revelations about the extent of government phone and internet surveillance are already shaking up the national debate			1
but these programs are just symptoms of broader changes that will be shaking up our government and society for many decades to come			1
let 's not cheapen or simplify the debate by trying to ram these revelations into the @entity15 - friendly framework of " another @entity17 scandal			1
" we should be honest and admit that something much bigger than that is going on here			0
the implication of the issue for our politics will be felt long after today 's round of political " gotcha " and " pin the tail on the donkey " has faded away			1
the @entity28 and @entity29 have been mining internet servers , searching for e-mails , videos and other documents under a program code - named @entity34 for six years			2
first , let me be clear : i am an opponent of @entity34			0
as a matter of first principles , i oppose overreaching , unaccountable spy programs			2
that 's why i supported neither the so - called @entity41 , nor the reauthorization of the @entity43 , when those measures were first considered by @entity45			2
nor was i supportive when president @entity46 aggressively deployed his new powers			0
nor was i supportive when evidence began to emerge that the government was interpreting overly broad laws in an overly broad manner			0
and i am not supportive now			0
even as a former @entity17 administration official , i am always willing , when necessary , to constructively criticize the @entity53 on matters of national importance			1
but i oppose those who would try to pretend that this is somehow " another @entity17 scandal			1
what is happening is broader than that : all three branches of government and both political parties are implicated			1
@entity45 passed the @entity41 and the @entity43 , and both the @entity17 and @entity46 administrations have implemented these programs			1
this is not a partisan issue			0
in fact , it is much larger than any political scandal du jour			1
we are seeing the collision of two new forces in our society with something old , but precious			0
new : the ability of terrorists , including lone wolves , to strike us at any time , including with weapons of massive destruction			0
new : information technology that gives the government extraordinary spying abilities , far beyond what was technically feasible even a decade ago			2
old : our @entity87 , written centuries before programs like @entity34 could even be imagined , yet a rightly revered document that should guide us still today			0
how we balance these three factors is one of the great challenges for this generation of @entity94			0
indeed , the collision is actually turning our political parties inside out			2
there are " state powers versus civil liberties " fights happening within both parties			1
presidents @entity17 and @entity46 line up on one side , together			2
on the other side are such strange bedfellows as sens. @entity107 , @entity108 ; @entity109 , @entity110 ; and @entity111 , @entity108			0
the issues are so deep , profound and even existential that neither party has a stable , predictable , internal consensus			0
translation : arguments will be heated over this balance in both parties ' presidential debates			2
in the @entity123 primary and during the 2016 convention , champions of civil liberties will certainly challenge @entity17 pragmatists over government spying			1
this will be especially true if vice president @entity128 and / or former secretary of state @entity129 seek the presidency			0
meanwhile , inside the @entity15 , right - wing libertarians will challenge security hawks over the same issue			1
it is uncertain which side in which party will win this debate			0
but for once , at least , we are about to enter territory that can not easily be viewed through the lens of " party versus party			0
" the battle to define the proper balance between civil liberties and national security is more likely to emerge as a case of " principle versus principle , " fought out inside each party			1
the resulting dynamic could create very interesting political coalitions in 2016 and even a new " issue map " for @entity94 politics -- completely redrawn by one of the defining debates of our time			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			2

@entity159 : spying programs are symptoms of broader , long - lasting changes
@entity159 : this is not " another @entity17 scandal ; " all government branches and parties *involved*
@entity159 : finding a balance between civil liberties and national security is the challenge
it will cause unusual political coalitions and be a new defining debate , he says
