-- this week the 19th @entity1 is being held in @entity2			2
it is the " state of the @entity5 epidemic " forum -- where researchers , advocates , social service providers , and people with @entity5 from all of the world learn about advances in aids treatment , care and prevention			1
twenty - six years ago i gave birth to my third child , @entity19			1
@entity19 's first three years of life were a constant struggle of countless surgeries , misdiagnosis , feeding tubes and painful medical tests			2
my husband , @entity27 and i took her to medical experts around the country			1
they all asked the same questions , but they could not provide answers or a cure for her illnesses			2
i still remember the pain in her eyes			2
when @entity19 was 2 years old , my husband @entity27 became ill. he was tired all of the time , he had flu - like symptoms and began to lose weight			1
the cycle began again -- misdiagnosis , hospitalizations , tests and more encounters with doctors who did n't understand what was happening to my family			0
prior to @entity27 and @entity19 becoming ill , we were living the so - called @entity56 dream			0
@entity27 had escaped the whirlpool of chaos in a community in @entity60 decimated by drugs			0
he had been clean from intravenous drug use for more than 10 years			0
we got married , worked hard , saved our money , bought a home in the suburbs and raised our children			1
at that time doctors did not know or understand the latency of @entity69 , the modes of transmission , or the differences in @entity69 manifestations in men , women and children			1
interactive : 30 years of @entity5 moments to remember when @entity27 was finally diagnosed with @entity5 , i witnessed a dramatic change in the quality of health care he received			1
his tray of food was left outside of his room ; the doctors and nurses were less attentive			0
there were no treatment options for him at the time			1
within days , @entity19 was given the same diagnosis , and the change in the type of care she received was just as obvious and even more painful			0
i was also diagnosed with @entity69 , but there was very little time to deal with that because my husband lay dying in one hospital , my youngest child lay dying in another hospital and there were two children at home who needed my care			1
@entity27 died a few months after being diagnosed with @entity5			1
within 6 months , @entity19 died too			0
i was 29 years old			0
i spent the next months putting things in order to ensure that my two remaining children , @entity110 and @entity111 would be taken care of			1
i began to lose weight			0
every time i had a fever or a bout of diarrhea i thought that i was going to die			0
i had two frightened children and i could not break down in front of them			1
i would cry in the closet in my bedroom to keep them from hearing me			0
i was distraught because i would not see @entity111 and @entity110 grow up , graduate from school , or get married			0
i missed @entity27 and @entity19			0
i could n't understand why they died and i was still alive			0
the days became months and even years			0
i lived my life in fear and dread , waiting to die			0
for years i believed the media hype that women were not being infected with hiv / aids			1
i thought i was the only one			0
i was so lonely that i decided to reach out			0
i posted a flyer in a hospital seeking other women with @entity5 to come to a support group at my home			1
to my surprise , within days the telephone began ringing off the hook			0
i would get phone calls late at night from young girls and women -- some were in their hospital beds , others isolated in their homes , too afraid to disclose their @entity69 status to anyone			1
within weeks , the support group became so large , it outgrew my living room and we began to meet in the basement of a church			1
there were professional women , teachers , physicians , secretaries , bus drivers			1
i began to go with women to their doctor 's appointments , advocating that they receive the appropriate care			1
women needed so much , but our stories were not being told ; we were not the face of @entity5			1
women needed shelter from abusive husbands , they needed clothes and food for their children or they just needed someone to talk to			1
we shared our stories of frustration about not finding services and support for women living with hiv / aids			1
gay , bisexual black men at high risk for @entity69 women talked about physicians who refused to treat them or who did not know how to treat the different manifestations of hiv / aids in women			1
women talked about having their @entity69 status disclosed in public places			1
we talked about other things beyond @entity69			0
we talked about love and we laughed a lot			0
even as we lost our friends , we did n't talk about dying			1
we talked about learning to live with @entity69			0
in less than two years , the support group became a nonprofit organization called @entity198			1
in 1996 , it provided services to 50 women in the @entity2 , which has one of the of the highest incidence of @entity69 in the country			1
the core of our mission is peer - based , woman - focused and family - centered			0
back then , i worked full - time and i was able to get enough funding to hire a part - time person			0
today the women 's collective has 20 full - time staff and a host of volunteers			1
we provide a wide range of services including case management services , helping women find health and other types of services			2
the goal is to keep woman in care			0
we provide aids - prevention education , counseling and testing services , and therapeutic counseling services			0
women and their children can come in and use our computers for schoolwork or work on a resume			1
they can come in and get hot food			0
we have a food and clothes pantry so they can take stuff home			0
our aids prevention education services reaches more than 3,000 women and young girls in schools , social service agencies , churches , and hospitals			2
we have shared our model of care with women from around the world , including @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258			2
the staff and the women we serve also participate in policy advocacy at the local and national level			2
it is empowering because we are literally fighting for our lives			0
women with @entity5 and their families face so many challenges			1
the only way to address our needs is to take our concerns to the policy makers and service providers who are supposed to serve us			0
during the last four months , the women 's collective has been preparing for the @entity1 in @entity2 and i have been thinking about how much -- and how little -- things have changed over the last 26 years			2
over the years , i have been able to access treatment because i have the resources			2
but unfortunately many people still do n't have the resources necessary to access treatment and care			2
they are also struggling with homelessness , hunger , and lack of employment			0
what is often overlooked at these conferences is the impact of the stigma and social isolation associated with an hiv diagnosis , especially for women and children			1
twenty - six years ago i was afraid that if people learned about my diagnosis , my children would be marginalized and we would be shunned by my community			1
pastor fights @entity69 stigma in rural town as recently as 2011 , a school in @entity304 , @entity305 , denied admittance to a 13 - year - old honor student because he is @entity69 - positive			0
twenty - six years ago , @entity27 and @entity19 were misdiagnosed by several physicians at hospitals across the country			2
in 2012 , women served by @entity198 continue to share the same stories of being misdiagnosed or not receiving the most appropriate standards of @entity69 care			2
years ago , treatment options were limited			1
today , there are more treatment options , but access to these treatments continue to be a huge problem due to budget cuts to the @entity322 and @entity323			2
twenty years ago there were waiting lists for life - saving @entity5 drugs			1
today people are yet again being placed on waiting lists			0
@entity5 organizations , especially community - based organizations , face tremendous budget cuts			1
@entity5 is no longer the " hot " topic and funding for @entity5 programs across the country is being reduced			1
the sense of urgency has dissipated			0
over the next few days of the conference , i am sure i will learn a lot that will give me hope			0
i have been blessed to see my children @entity111 and @entity110 graduate from college and graduate school			2
i am now a grandmother with a brilliant 2 - year - old grandson ! some days i struggle with a range of medical issues , but i am thankful to be alive			0
every day i think about @entity27 and @entity19			0
i remember all of the wonderful , brilliant , friends lost throughout the years			2
i mourn the loss of @entity350 and several women that we served at @entity198 , who lost their battle to @entity5 last month			1
i look forward to the day when i do n't have to add any more names to the list of lives lost			2
this week , several newspapers and magazines have declared that the @entity5 epidemic is over			1
the epidemic is n't over			0
@entity361 approves @entity362 for prevention of hiv / aids			2

@entity366 lost her husband and daughter to @entity5 two decades ago
@entity366 has hiv and started a support group for women and children with the *disease*
@entity366 : we have made progress , but still need to work on treatment accessibility
