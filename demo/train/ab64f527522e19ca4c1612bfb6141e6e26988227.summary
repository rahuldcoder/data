@entity0 -- the top @entity3 official tasked with assessing the damage from @entity6 's leaks says he would consider amnesty for the former contractor in exchange for a halt to the flow of top secret information about @entity14 spying			1
@entity6 , currently in @entity15 evading a @entity14 warrant for his arrest on espionage charges , leaked information on widespread data collection that 's spurred outcry and forced president @entity21 to review the spy agency 's powers			2
" my personal view is , yes , it 's worth having a conversation about			2
i would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured , and my bar for those assurances would be very high			0
it would be more than just an assertion on his part , " @entity32 said on " @entity33 " on sunday			0
he said the agency 's assessment of @entity6 's leaks has cost millions of dollars			0
gen. @entity41 , the @entity3 's director , said on the same program that he did n't support allowing @entity6 to go unpunished , and the @entity43 said monday it had n't changed its stance			1
@entity21 's 2013 : a very tough year " mr. @entity6 is charged with a felony , and he should return home to face those charges , where he will be afforded all due process , " @entity46 spokeswoman @entity45 said			0
on friday , a review panel of outside officials delivered dozens of recommendations to @entity21 on ways the @entity14 can balance necessary intelligence gathering with expectations of privacy among both @entity14 and foreign governments			2
convened amid a series of leaks from @entity6 , the review board operated in private , and its recommendations wo n't be made public until next month			1
" we expect our overall internal review to be completed in january and the president thereafter to deliver remarks to outline the outcomes of our work , " @entity45 said friday			0
the review came as newspapers published story after story detailing the spying powers of the @entity3 and other federal agencies , including reports that the @entity14 government tracked the cell phones of @entity79 chancellor @entity78 and other leaders			1
the revelations prompted outcry from @entity14 and foreign governments , concerned the @entity14 was overreaching in its efforts to thwart terrorist attacks			0
reports published in @entity85 and the @entity86 last week indicated the recommendations from the review group included transferring the command of the @entity3 from military to civilian leadership and handing over control of cell phone records to a third party			1
opinion : @entity97 spying is reaching scary levels some opponents of the @entity3 programs have called for the agency 's spying and military cybercommand to be split into two ; however , on friday the @entity43 said the dual @entity3 missions would remain under one chief to avoid duplicated work and foster cooperation			1
@entity108 , a former @entity3 director , said on sunday the agency 's boss does n't necessarily have to be a military commander			1
" my view would be take the best @entity14 out there and put them in the job , do n't make it a requirement that they 'd be in ( or ) out of uniform , " he said			0
@entity21 has come under pressure from his liberal base to find ways of curbing the federal government 's spying powers , including demands from lawmakers that more oversight be enacted to prevent abuses during the secretive legal process allowing spying to take place			0
" nothing short of stopping the mass , suspicionless surveillance of @entity14 is acceptable , " @entity133 , legislative counsel for the @entity134 , said last week , as reports of the review panel 's recommendation leaked			1
" we look forward to evaluating the report 's details and whether the reported ' stricter rules ' for obtaining @entity14 records are a meaningful and substantive improvement			1
in the end , however , @entity147 must pass legislation to end bulk collection of @entity14 ' sensitive call records			0
requiring third parties to store @entity14 ' records for the government is not a solution			0
" @entity21 vowed at the beginning of december to find ways of reforming the @entity3 , though in making the pledge he also defended the agency 's work			1
" i 'll be proposing some self - restraint on the @entity3 , and you know , to initiate some reforms that can give people more confidence , " he told @entity161 on december 5			2
" but i want everybody to be clear : the people of the @entity3 generally are looking out for the safety of the @entity14 people			2
