-- health officials have confirmed that a patient who underwent neurosurgery at a @entity5 hospital earlier this year had @entity6			1
the death , and suspicions that the patient may have had the devastating brain ailment , prompted authorities in two states to warn that as many as 13 patients may have been exposed to surgical equipment used during the patient 's surgery , thus to the same disease			1
the now - deceased patient had undergone neurosurgery at @entity19 in @entity20			0
the patient was later suspected of having sporadic @entity6 , a rare , rapidly progressing and always - fatal degenerative brain disease			1
but by the time this diagnosis was suspected , equipment used in the patient 's surgery had been used several other operations			1
this raised the possibility that the equipment might have been contaminated -- especially since normal sterilization procedures are not enough to get rid of the disease proteins , known as prions , tied to @entity6 -- thus potentially exposing the other patients to infection			1
the patient 's death spurred the @entity5 @entity35 to announce september 4 that eight other patients at the same @entity20 hospital were being monitored for @entity6			1
@entity39 health authorities noted the next day that five @entity41 patients may have been exposed to @entity6 too because their surgeons this summer later used the same potentially contaminated medical equipment as in the @entity5 facility			1
the diagnosis of @entity6 disease was confirmed by the @entity47 , which reported its conclusion to @entity5 's health department and @entity19 on friday			2
" though we are not surprised by the test results , we are saddened by the toll this disease takes on families , " said dr. @entity50 , @entity5 's public health director			2
people with @entity6 typically show signs of rapidly progressing dementia , impaired vision and personality changes , among other symptoms , according to the @entity62			0
yet while it can be suspected , the only way the disease can be confirmed is through tests conducted after a person 's death			2
the status of the five southeast @entity39 patients who 'd been warned was n't immediately known friday night			0
the eight being monitored at @entity20 's @entity19 have been told about the original patient 's " autopsy results			2
" " we let them know we will continue to help and support them and to monitor their health going forward , " said hospital president dr. @entity73 , " even though the risk is extremely low that any of these patients was infected			1
" @entity6 has a long incubation period before symptoms appear -- sometimes up to 50 years -- according the @entity62			0
there 's no test , so it may take many years before these patients would know if they were infected			0
about 300 people a year in the @entity88 come down with @entity6 , according to the @entity89			0
the @entity89 has said that no cases of the disease linked to the use of contaminated medical equipment have been reported in the @entity88 since 1976			0
most medical devices are sterilized by heat , but the @entity96 recommends the use of a caustic chemical like sodium hydroxide to disinfect equipment that may have come in contact with tissues that could cause @entity6			0
@entity0 's @entity103 and @entity104 contributed to this report .			0

a test confirms a @entity5 patient died of the fatal brain disease
after this patient 's death , authorities said 13 others may have been exposed
normal equipment sterilization is n't adequate to *eradicate* disease - carrying proteins
hospital president : " the risk is extremely low that any of these patients was infected "
