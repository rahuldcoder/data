@entity0 -- much has changed in technology over the past 14 years , including @entity4 's forecast for the industry 's biggest player , @entity7			1
the history of @entity7 has been a hot topic in the two weeks since the death of its co-founder @entity11			1
one of the most repeated quotes came from the founder of @entity14 , a longtime @entity7 competitor in personal computers			1
at a tech conference in october 1997 , @entity14 was asked what he would do with @entity7 if he were in charge of the beleaguered company			1
" what would i do ? i 'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders , " @entity14 replied after some prodding			0
by that time , in the late 1990s , @entity7 was on its fourth ceo in just a few years , and @entity11 had recently returned as interim ceo when the company acquired his failed education - equipment vendor called @entity29			1
@entity7 's troubles were well known within the industry , so @entity14 's comment , while brusque , was n't out of line with other pundits '			1
" it was on the rocks , " @entity11 said of @entity7 upon his return in 1997 , speaking at a conference last year			1
" @entity7 was about 90 days from going bankrupt back then in the early days , and it was much worse than i thought when i went back initially			0
" but as we know now , @entity11 orchestrated a miraculous turnaround , taking @entity7 from near - bankruptcy to most valuable company by market capitalization			2
when asked about his famous statement on tuesday at a conference in @entity0 , @entity14 paused to ponder the question as the audience laughed loudly			0
" it 's a great question and a great opportunity to clarify what i said , " @entity14 said			0
" the meaning of my answer was that i am the ceo of @entity14			0
i do n't think of being a ceo of any other company			0
" @entity14 explained that he answered the question reluctantly and that he had not thought deeply about how to turn @entity7 around because he would never want to run another company			2
" i am not a ceo for hire , " the @entity14 chief said			0
he then went on to shower praises on the late computer pioneer and recalled when a 16 - year - old @entity14 first met @entity11 in @entity61			1
" @entity11 will be missed and was a friend , " he said			0
in january 2006 , @entity11 sent a companywide memo that read : " team , it turned out that @entity4 was n't perfect at predicting the future			2
based on today 's stock market close , @entity7 is worth more than @entity14			2
stocks go up and down , and things may be different tomorrow , but i thought it was worth a moment of reflection today			0
" we 'll never know how @entity11 would have responded to @entity14 's about - face			0
but when an @entity7 employee asked the newly installed interim ceo in 1997 about @entity14 's original statement , according to venture capitalist and former @entity7 employee @entity77 , @entity11 said , " f * * * @entity4			1

@entity4 seems to *regret* a statement he made about @entity7 in 1997
@entity14 had once said that @entity7 should shut itself down
now , @entity14 praises @entity11 and calls him a friend
