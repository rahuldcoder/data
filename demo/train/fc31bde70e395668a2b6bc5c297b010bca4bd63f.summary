before @entity2 ran an article about rape on the @entity6 campus , the reporter and school officials traded dozens of emails from september 5 to november 19			1
on friday , @entity6 released that correspondence to @entity9 and other media outlets that had made freedom of information requests			1
the magazine 's article was published november 19 and started by telling about " @entity15 , " a student who said she was gang - raped in a fraternity house in fall 2012			1
after the @entity18 and other media outlets found inconsistencies in the article , @entity2 apologized for several reporting mistakes , such as not trying to reach the men who allegedly committed the rape			1
" we apologize to anyone who was affected by the story and we will continue to investigate the events of that evening , " the magazine said earlier this month			0
also on friday , @entity29 spoke to the school 's @entity30 , or governing body , saying the article had hurt innocent people , set back efforts to stop sexual assaults and tarnished the school 's reputation			2
@entity29 said the school wanted to find the truth , but faced several obstacles , including " the massive failure of journalistic ethics reflected in the @entity2 article " and " the rush to judgment by some who first faulted the university			2
" @entity29 said the results of investigations by police and the state attorney general 's office will be released eventually , subject to restrictions of state and federal law			2
here are five things revealed by the correspondence			2
@entity15 was never mentioned in emails between writer @entity59 , the magazine fact checker and university officials			1
though @entity15 's story of being raped was the most sensational part of the @entity2 story , it never comes up in 100 - plus pages of emails			1
most of the emails concern scheduling for interviews , discuss policy and ask for facts and figures			2
however , @entity59 did mention @entity15 in an october 27 email to a student who told the reporter she had been sexually assaulted			1
" you figure into the article as a survivor , activist and mentor / support for @entity15 , " @entity59 said			2
@entity6 told @entity59 she got it wrong in describing a spring 2014 sexual assault complaint			1
in the article , a woman the magazine called " @entity85 " said a male friend groped her and stuck his hand down her sweatpants one night while she vomited into a toilet after drinking too much whiskey , then " digitally penetrated " her			0
@entity85 said she discovered two other women had been assaulted by the same man			0
she filed a formal complaint , expecting him to be expelled after a hearing , but was disappointed when the @entity97 only suspended him for one year			0
" your characterization of the facts of the spring 2014 case you referenced during our interview is incorrect , " a @entity6 spokesman , @entity99 , told @entity59 in an october 9 email			1
@entity107 told fact checker @entity108 in a november 13 email , " it has been brought to our attention by a few students that @entity59 has spoken to that she is referencing an incident where a male student raped three different women and received a one - year suspension			1
that is in fact objectively false			1
" when @entity59 asked him to clarify what she got wrong , @entity99 said , " due to privacy concerns , we are unable to be more specific about the spring 2014 case			2
@entity6 severely limited @entity59 's access to university officials			1
in the first email , on september 5 , @entity59 contacted @entity128 , head of @entity6 's @entity97 , and said she 's writing a story about " rape / rape culture on college campuses " and how sexual assaults are handled at @entity6			1
@entity128 seemed interested in cooperating and said " i 'm glad you reached out			0
" they set up an interview for september 12			0
@entity59 told @entity136 , chief university spokesman , on september 10 that she 'd like him to clear an interview with @entity138 at the women 's center			1
but on september 11 @entity136 said @entity59 could not interview @entity128 and @entity138 , saying either he or the university president will answer all the questions			0
he apologizes for the " change in direction			0
" @entity128 was mentioned many times in the article , but never quoted			0
only school president @entity146 was allowed to comment for the university			0
when @entity59 was setting up an interview with @entity146 , she complained that @entity6 's public affairs office insisted some of their employees be present			1
" i do n't generally conduct interviews with @entity156 people sitting in , " she wrote on september 15			0
@entity136 replied : " either i or somebody from my office would be in the room for the phone call and perhaps somebody from the office of student affairs , too			0
we would do this whether the interview was on phone or in person , and we would record it as well			0
" @entity59 said , " if that 's the only way i will be allowed to talk with president @entity146 , then so be it			0
but i imagine a university president is fully capable of getting through a phone conversation on her own , without help			0
my article will obviously mention the way @entity6 has sought to restrict and pad my access to administrators			1
" @entity136 replied , " i 'm sorry you think your story would need to describe the university as restricting access but i am happy that we are able to connect you with our top administrator -- the president -- for an interview			2
the reporter explained why another alleged sexual assault victim 's story was downplayed			2
" i talk about your own assault in the broadest of strokes , " @entity59 said in an october 27 email to a student who said she was raped after a party during the early part of her freshman year			0
" sadly there was no room in the article for the full contours of your story , in all its detail , which frankly could be an article unto itself ! same can be said of basically every survivor i had the honor of interviewing			0
