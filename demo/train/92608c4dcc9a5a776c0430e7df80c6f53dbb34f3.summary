-- on september 13 , president @entity1 spoke about the importance of historically black colleges and universities as part of @entity6			1
it was a thrill for me to be there			0
he paid tribute those who created these schools : " we remember all the men and women who took great risks and made extraordinary sacrifices to ensure that these institutions that you lead could exist , " @entity1 said			1
" we remember that at a critical time in our nation 's history , @entity21 waged war against illiteracy and ignorance -- and won			0
" i appreciated the president 's words of praise and encouragement			0
but i felt that one group was overlooked in the president 's remarks : the churches that brought these remarkable institutions into being			1
@entity37 - the @entity37 represents the nation 's private black colleges and universities			1
private hbcus trace their history to the years just before and after the @entity43 , when they were founded by a variety of christian denominations			1
they were some of the few institutions of that era that believed educating slaves , former slaves and other free blacks was worth the resources that this daunting work required			0
in 1867 , two years after the @entity43 ended , @entity55 was established in the basement of @entity57 , the oldest independent @entity59 church in the @entity60 , in @entity61 , @entity62			1
its purpose was to prepare black men for the ministry and teaching			2
@entity55 is now known as @entity55 , a historically black college in @entity68 , @entity62 , and a @entity37 member			2
i vividly remember being introduced to the historic role churches played in black education			1
my mother , a journalist covering the civil rights movement , moved our family from @entity77 , @entity78 , to @entity79 in 1961			0
we spent six months living in rural @entity80 , home to the legendary @entity80 ( now @entity80 ) and near the state capital , @entity83			0
@entity83 was at the time the center of a movement led largely by black ministers under the guidance of the rev. @entity88 that time in @entity80 , along with my college years at @entity55 , imprinted on me the powerful connection between the black church , its social justice mission , and @entity21			1
the churches ' investment in black education paid dividends , not only to the students , but also for @entity60			1
during the long dark days of @entity99 segregation , @entity21 educated the lawyers , doctors , teachers and ministers who built black communities across the @entity104			2
they educated the pioneering activists who built the civil rights movement that broke @entity99 's back			0
@entity60 rep. @entity108 , @entity62 , a civil rights pioneer , graduated from @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112			1
@entity113 , founder and president of the @entity115 , attended @entity116 in @entity68			0
@entity88 graduated from my alma mater , @entity55			0
every historically black college or university produced activists who helped break down the barriers of segregation and transform our nation			2
over the decades , these church - founded colleges and universities developed a finely tuned balance between their religious roots and their secular missions			1
as institutions of higher education accredited by secular agencies , and as educators of students who , upon graduation , needed to compete in the job market , they offered courses that would prepare their students for employment			1
but as church - affiliated institutions , their education provided another element : the education emphasized moral character and community service			1
the dedication to service has become a hallmark of @entity21 graduates			0
earlier this month , the @entity153 issued its liberal arts college rankings , which are based on the school 's contribution " to the public good , " including the role that service plays in the education			2
private historically black colleges and universities were highly ranked			2
@entity55 was @entity164 among the nation 's 252 liberal arts colleges			0
all told , 20 of @entity37 's 39 member @entity21 ranked in the top half of their categories			0
hbcus have also been exemplars of how institutions with different religious affiliations can work together in harmony toward a common goal			1
many @entity21 are affiliated with denominations widely recognized for their support in the @entity59 - @entity59 community -- the various baptist conventions , the @entity176 , the @entity177 and the @entity178			2
but @entity183 in @entity184 , @entity185 , the nation 's leading educator of future black physicians and pharmacists , is a @entity190 institution			2
and @entity191 in @entity79 is closely affiliated with the @entity192			0
despite the wide religious diversity among private @entity21 -- or , perhaps because of it -- these colleges and universities came together to start the @entity37 in 1944			2
they have worked together under the @entity37 umbrella to raise and distribute more than $ 3 billion and help more than 350,000 students graduate from @entity37 member institutions			0
the @entity37 's experiment in collaboration among religiously affiliated colleges and universities has worked for two principal reasons			0
first , the schools that united under the @entity37 banner found that they could accommodate to the civil - society needs of their educational institutions without giving up their core convictions			1
in fact , what the churches brought to these institutions strengthened them			0
second , those schools discovered that although each denomination has maintained its own beliefs , the ties that bind them together are stronger than the forces that divide them			0
in a nation and world in which religions are too often pitted against civil society -- and against each other -- @entity60 's private @entity21 provide an example of how communities of faith can work harmoniously with civil society and how differing religions can work with each other for their mutual benefit , the benefit of those they serve and the even greater benefit of the country .			1

@entity239 : churches ' investment in black education paid dividends for @entity60
@entity245 : church - founded schools learned to balance religious roots and secular missions
