the team behind a smartphone - based portable eye examination kit have just launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for new innovation			1
@entity6 comprises a smartphone app and low - cost adaptor that enables professional eye examinations anywhere in the world			1
developed by a team of eye care specialists , software developers and product designers , it aims to increase access to high - quality eye care worldwide			1
the tools have been developed through a collaboration between the @entity20 , the @entity21 and the @entity22			1
their latest adaptor , @entity25 , can be clipped over the camera of a smartphone to allow health workers to see inside an eye and capture high - quality images to be sent to experts for diagnosis			1
it removes the need for traditional ophthalmoscopes and bulky cameras , enabling examinations in any part of the world			2
other conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure can be detected			0
" around 39 million people are blind , " @entity6 's creator dr @entity43 told @entity44			1
" 80 % of this blindness is avoidable , but in many regions people do n't have access to eye care , " he said			1
the @entity52 campaign allows pledgers to purchase the kit for themselves for £ 60 ( $ 95 ) or pay for it to be sent to a healthcare worker on their behalf , via their partners @entity60 and the @entity61			2
the estimated delivery date is october 2015			0
the kit currently only works on a @entity64 , so they need investment to make it universal			0
it also does n't currently have @entity69 approval so ca n't be shipped to the @entity70 see also : hoax radio message sparks search for fake missing plane more substantial donations offer the chance to be a founding supporter , or to join their distribution network			0
@entity25 was borne out of @entity43 ' frustration at having to transport bulky eye equipment to remote areas in @entity82 during a community study as part of his phd at the @entity20			1
he was carrying " around £ 100,00 of kit " , including a slit lamp , a retinal camera and big vision charts among other items			0
" all required a stable power supply and people to operate them , " he said			2
" i thought there must be another way			0
" the @entity6 system can replace all of that , and offers more benefits on top , he insists			1
for example , a phone 's gps can be used to mark the location of someone the team has examined , so they can follow up with appropriate treatment			2
another advantage of the system is that people without healthcare backgrounds can be trained to use the kit			2
the team saw a number of patients using both systems , the " gold standard " original kit and the smartphone option , and sent the results to @entity120 , who decided both systems were comparable			1
the team received funding from @entity125 in 2013 and are using that support to conduct a series of trials over the next five years among communities in @entity82 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and the @entity134			0
dr @entity135 , lecturer in the @entity136 at the @entity21 , who also worked on the project said : " @entity25 is the optimal combination of solid engineering experience , ingenuity and outlook to social impact			0
the @entity145 adapter is the most exciting thing my group has ever designed ; it is incredibly simple and yet it will change the way we look at eyes			0
