-- @entity1 , home of the @entity3 @entity2 , has officially unveiled a new circuit that will host both @entity5 and @entity2 this year			1

new sections -- farm curve , village corner , @entity22 , @entity24 corner and @entity21 -- have all been added and a new pit and paddock complex is currently in development			0
this is expected to be completed ahead of the 2011 @entity3 @entity2			1
@entity1 is owned by the @entity29 and president @entity30 , the 1996 world champion , admitted to reporters that there was a financial risk involved in spending so much money on the new circuit			2

the alternative was that the @entity3 @entity2 would have gone off the calendar , " admitted @entity30			1
" there is a justification to demand first - class facilities if you have a first - class event like @entity5 , and others like @entity2 , but it has to make financial sense			2
" we are relying a little on this country 's tradition of producing world - class drivers who potentially drive people through the gate			0
