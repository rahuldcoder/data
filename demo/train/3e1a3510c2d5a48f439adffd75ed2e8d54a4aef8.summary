-- the vigilantes came to violence - torn towns with a simple pitch : join us and fight back before the cartel kills you			1
for some in the western state of @entity10 , long a flashpoint in @entity12 's drug war , it was an offer they could n't refuse			1
they toted guns and called themselves self - defense groups as they patrolled the streets , claiming they were forced to fight the @entity18 cartel themselves because the state had failed to protect them			1
they took over several communities and sent a clear message to cartel members and authorities : keep out			1
but this week , the @entity12 government stepped in , sending federal forces to the region and ordering the vigilante groups to lay down their weapons			1
the smoldering situation has become a major problem for president @entity34 's government , which has vowed to reduce drug violence			1
in some areas , it has n't gone smoothly , with both sides refusing to back down in tense standoffs			2
@entity12 soldiers clashed with self - defense group members tuesday in the town of @entity43 , killing at least one person			1
and even as federal troops patrolled the city of @entity48 , tensions ran high after a pharmacy burned down in a suspected arson attack just blocks away from @entity51 on wednesday			2
by thursday , @entity12 authorities said they 'd gained control of 20 municipalities in the region			1
but a top security official said he could n't set a date guaranteeing when the state would be safe			0
some vigilante groups have vowed not to hand over their guns until cartel leaders are captured			1
" we want them to go rescue the towns where the people are still being massacred by organized crime , " said @entity62 , a spokesman for the self - defense groups			1
" when there is peace and security in our state , we will give up our weapons			1
" residents , meanwhile , told @entity75 they 're caught in the middle of spiraling violence that shows no sign of slowing			1
and some observers say it 's not clear the government crackdown is working			0
" federal authorities , instead of imposing order , instead of rescuing the cities , they are more like referees , " @entity82 , president of the @entity83 and @entity84 , told @entity75 this week			0
" they are watching the civil war in @entity10			0
" and the situation could have consequences beyond the state 's borders , security analyst @entity91 said			0
it 's possible , he said , that the phenomenon of vigilante groups could spread			1
" it is a real risk , " he told @entity0 en @entity99			0
" it is a scenario that should worry the people in charge of the country 's security policies			2
" resident : ' we do not know who to believe ' one @entity10 resident , who asked not to be identified out of concern for his safety , said a self - defense group gave residents few options but to support them when they swooped into the town of @entity116 , where much of the local economy depends on avocado orchards			2
" the words of the self - defense groups were very clear : ' if you do not arm yourselves , you could be killed by the @entity18			1
' this was the central point , " he recalled in an interview with @entity75 this week			0
and even with an increase in government forces in the area , he said , it 's a situation that is n't likely to stop any time soon , with so many decentralized groups spread across so many parts of the region			2
" we think that this is going to last for months , because there is not just one person who says , ' we are going to hand over our weapons to the @entity139 , ' " he said			2
" people are very afraid			0
we do not know who to believe			0
the self - defense groups tell us one thing , and the military tells us something else			2
" but in the meantime , he said , vigilantes have set up roadblocks around the town			2
and the town 's church bells have become a signal , he said , summoning vigilantes to stop cartel members from entering			1
analyst : problems paved the way for vigilantes self - defense groups have also surged in parts of the neighboring state of @entity161 , where government troops have struggled to put a stop to cartel violence			1
" we think the government is very timid , very slow , " @entity165 , the head of an association of restaurant and business owners in @entity169 , told @entity0 last year			0
" if there is no immediate response , it leaves us no choice but to join the fight			0
" several factors in @entity10 have paved the way for vigilante groups , @entity177 said -- especially the nature of the primary cartel operating there , the @entity18			1
it 's a group with a great focus on territory , @entity177 said			0
" and they tend to be much more involved in extortion , in robbery , and in different kinds of kidnapping , so they generate a lot more resistance than a traditional group dedicated to international drug trafficking , " @entity177 said			0
today 's problems started in the state at least a decade ago , said @entity198 , a former @entity10 government spokesman			0
" there were many years of abandonment in many communities , " he told @entity0 en @entity99			0
that allowed drug cartels to infiltrate , strengthening their grip on daily life and threatening those who did n't obey			0
" these criminal organizations would not subsist if these circumstances did not exist , " @entity198 said			0
" with many young people lacking education , lacking employment opportunities , they find the only path ... is to work for criminal groups			2
" concerns groups could have a darker aim some locals view the vigilantes as heroes			1
others see them as villains and have responded to their arrival by destroying property and setting vehicles ablaze to create fiery road blockades to stop them			0
in the past year , @entity177 said , even federal officials have been " schizophrenic " about how they approach the groups , sometimes cracking down on them and other times describing them as allies			2
critics suggest the vigilante groups contain some criminals from rival gangs who are using them as a means to win more territory			1
leaders of the groups have consistently denied such accusations , saying their only aim is to fight cartels and protect public safety			1
but @entity243 , appointed by the federal government this week to be a new commissioner heading up security in the state , offered an ominous warning thursday			0
in an interview with @entity250 , he noted that the @entity252 cartel -- which eventually splintered and led to the formation of the @entity18 -- also started out as a group that aimed to defend the state 's residents in a push to kick out the @entity258			1
the newly formed self - defense groups , he said , could become as ruthless as the cartels they claim to oppose			2
" you can start out with a genuine purpose , " he said			0
" but when you start taking control , making decisions and feeling authority ... you run the risk of reaching that point			0
" @entity270 and @entity0 en @entity99 's @entity271 and @entity272 contributed to this report .			0
