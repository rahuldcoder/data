@entity0 , @entity1 -- a lot of people have been outraged by the gender verification testing that @entity7 athlete @entity6 has been put through , and have been trying to be supportive of her ; but in doing so , they often further prejudice against the very thing which she appears to be : intersex			1
@entity11 says she looks forward to a day when intersex conditions like hers are widely accepted			1
intersex people ( formerly known as hermaphrodites ) are those born with bodies that are difficult to classify as either " male " or " female			1
" since results of @entity6 's tests were apparently leaked , it seems that her body does n't conform to the definition of " female " as one who has ovaries			2
i 'm intersex because , while i have ovaries , menstruate and can get pregnant , my genitalia is somewhat male - looking ( simply put , i have a clitoris that 's much larger than average			1
) throughout my childhood , i never thought i was anything other than " female " because that 's what i was labeled and raised as			2
while i felt more aggressive than other girls , i did n't think that anything other than male and female could exist			1
so i just thought of myself as a " different kind of woman			1
" ultimately , my assessment was pretty accurate			2
i was raised in a strict @entity46 home , where nudity and sex talk was unheard of , so having no one to compare my genitals to , i was unaware that mine were different			2
i 'm very lucky to have escaped the " corrective " surgeries and / or hormone treatments that are the norm for intersex infants , because my father went to medical school before these practices began ( in the mid-late ' 50 's ) , and knew that you should n't operate on a baby unless it 's absolutely necessary			1
later , when he wanted to give me estrogen pills at puberty to ensure that my body " feminized " ( he told me that the pills were to make me grow taller ) , my mother objected , saying it was experimental and that i did n't need it			2
thankfully , she won out			0
thus , no one ever told me there was anything wrong with my body ( that did n't happen until a gynecological visit when i was twenty ) , and i grew up loving it just the way it is			0
while many doctors would refer to my clitoris as " grossly enlarged , " i have to tell you , having an overabundance of the only organ in the human body whose sole purpose is pleasure is far from a negative thing ! i came of age sexually with my second boyfriend in high school			1
i broke up with him because i knew that i preferred girls , but i could n't act on it yet			0
once i did , in college , it confirmed that girls were what i 'd always longed for , and it was then that i realized how much my body differed from theirs			0
' still , i had no name for my difference			0
at the age of twenty - six , i finally discovered i was " intersex " from a newspaper article			1
fortunately , it was not about me specifically but about intersex in general , and i 'm glad that i , unlike @entity6 , had time to process the information and come out about it when i was ready to			1
i still had other issues i was dealing with -- namely : racism and homophobia -- so it took a year for me to embrace this additional minority status			0
once i did , it was a positive turning point			0
i 'd always felt strongly masculine and feminine , and now it made sense why these two presumably " opposite " traits existed , in me , side by side			0
i did n't think being intersex was a bad thing to be			1
i 'd already learned that people can be prejudiced against things they 're unfamiliar with , or are taught to dislike , and that we should n't take on their bigotry			0
on april 19 , 2002 , i appeared on the television news program " 20/20 " with a prominent urologist and " expert " on intersex conditions			1
when asked why he supported " corrective surgeries " he answered , " @entity128 ca n't accept people of different colors , and now we 're supposed to accept somebody with genitalia that do n't match what their gender is ? i do not believe this society is ready for it			0
" intersex folks are not some new invention that people need to be " ready for : " we exist and always have			1
resistance to accepting us has created the mess that @entity6 now finds herself in			0
if medicine had been more upfront about intersex conditions rather than pretending they 're just male and female as usual , they could have avoided ruining the career of some athletes			2
whichever condition @entity6 has , she should n't be made to suffer for others ' mistakes			0
since infancy , she 's been legally labeled , raised , and accepted as female			0
to be told that she ca n't compete as one now would be like being a @entity157 citizen all your life , but being suddenly denied a passport because somebody decided that the city you were born in is actually , sorry , on the wrong side of the border			0
for thirteen years i 've been outing myself as intersex just to let folks know we exist , and i 'm happy to say i 've seen progress			1
i look forward to one day telling my god - daughter about how it used to be for us , and to hearing her say , " wow , i ca n't believe some people had problems accepting intersex			2
humans can be so weird			0
