@entity0 , @entity1 -- heads hacked off , a bite from a lion , tiger or bear , massive muscles on massive men -- all clues that an ancient cemetery uncovered in northern @entity1 is the final resting place of gladiators , scientists have announced after seven years of investigations			1
the archeological dig has found " what may be the world 's only well - preserved @entity20 gladiator cemetery , " the @entity16 said			1
scientists have found 80 skeletons in the " unique " cemetery under the city of @entity25 , northern @entity1 , since 2003			1
they announced their discoveries on sunday , ahead of a documentary about the site due to air in @entity30 on june 14			1
this was one of two big archaeological developments , with @entity35 scientists announcing the discovery of a huge cache of ancient religious objects			1
they first thought the graveyard might contain the remains of criminals or political purges			0
but that does n't explain the teeth mark			1
" one of the most significant items of evidence is a large carnivore bite mark - probably inflicted by a lion , tiger or bear -- an injury which must have been sustained in an arena context , " said @entity46 , the lead archeologist on the dig. " nothing like them has ever been identified before on a @entity20 skeleton , " said @entity57 , who examined the remains in the forensic anthropology laboratory at the @entity60			1
he said the bite marks suggest the remains were of someone who fought as a gladiator			2
" it would seem highly unlikely that this individual was attacked by a tiger as he was walking home from the pub in @entity25 2,000 years ago , " he said			1
one arm was bigger than the other in many remains , the scientists found -- a suggestion that the men were gladiators who trained from a young age with a weapon in one hand			2
other clues include healed and unhealed weapon injuries , possible hammer blows to the head , and burial with " grave goods " such joints of meat or pottery -- a sign of respect			1
it 's not certain that the men were gladiators , @entity46 cautioned			2
" the research is continuing and we must , therefore , keep an open mind , " the archeologist said			0
but " almost all the individuals are male , very robust and mostly above average height -- features which would also be consistent with a gladiator interpretation			0
many also have muscle attachment marks on their arm bones suggesting severe muscle stress , " he said			2
they also appear to come from all over the @entity20 , which straddled the @entity109 for hundreds of years , starting more than 2,000 years ago			2
" these are internationally important discoveries			0
we do n't have any other potential gladiator cemeteries with this level of preservation anywhere else in the world , " @entity57 said			0
the skeletons are between 1,600 and 1,900 years old			2
the most impressive grave was that of a tall man aged between 18 and 23 , buried , probably in a coffin , in a large oval grave about 1,700 years ago			1
he had been decapitated by several sword blows to the neck , the scientists said			0
buried with him were what appear to have been the remains of substantial joints of meat from at least four horses -- that left behind 424 horse bones -- possibly consumed at the funeral , plus some cow and pig remains			0
other graves also had joints of horse , sheep or chicken , possibly remains of funeral feasts , the archeologists speculated			0
the site was first discovered when archeologists probed an area scheduled for a housing development in 2003			0
also on monday , @entity35 archeologists announced the discovery of a huge cache of religious objects about 3,500 years old -- older than the @entity152 itself , and nearly twice the age of the @entity20 skeletons			1
" it would appear that the vessels were used in a pagan cult that worshipped idols			0
during this period it was customary that each city had a temple of its own where special cultic vessels were used , " said archaeologists @entity160 and @entity162			0
they include a vessel that was used for burning incense , a sculpted face of a woman that was part of a cultic cup used in dedicating a libation to a god , goblets and bowls with high bases and tableware that was intended for eating and drinking , the @entity167 said			0
scientists called the discovery " extremely rare " -- both because it is so old and because the objects are so well preserved			1
some of them had been brought from @entity184 in @entity185 , including a storage vessel for precious oils -- evidence of the ancient trade relations that existed with @entity185 , they said .			0
