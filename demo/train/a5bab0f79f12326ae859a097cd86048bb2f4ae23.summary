-- there 's a silly rumor exploding on the @entity3 this weekend , alleging that @entity4 is shutting down on march 15 because ceo @entity7 " wants his old life back , " and desires to " put an end to all the madness			1
" we have official confirmation from @entity4 director of corporate communications @entity13 that the rumor is false			1
we asked him via e-mail if @entity4 was shutting down on march 15 , to which he responded , " the answer is no , so please help us put an end to this silliness			2
" he added , " we did n't get the memo about shutting down and there 's lots to do , so we 'll just keep cranking away like always			2
" let 's think about this for a minute			0
would @entity4 decide to shut down the company just a few days after announcing a round of funding , consisting of $ 450 million from @entity28 and $ 50 million from @entity30 investment firm @entity29 , on a valuation of $ 50 billion ? the spurious report was started by a site to which we refuse to link , known for its reports of impending attacks of alien spaceships and false reports of a @entity40 pregnancy			0
the fact that this absurd hoax spread so efficiently makes us wonder : will people believe anything ? Â© 2013 @entity0			0
