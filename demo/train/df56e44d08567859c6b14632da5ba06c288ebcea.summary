@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity4 was among at least 11 people who died after the cruise ship @entity7 ran aground and rolled on its side last week off a @entity11 island , officials said wednesday			1
the mayor 's office in @entity14 , the provincial capital , identified the victim as @entity16 , a member of the crew			1
his body was one of five recovered tuesday			0
the office said 26 people remained missing			0
but the list may include some of the five victims			0
rescue crews suspended operations wednesday as the ship began to move , the @entity1 coast guard said			1

the family of two missing @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 of @entity34 , @entity35 , said it was thankful for perilous attempts to find those still unaccounted for			0
" while it is certainly hard for us to see the recovery efforts stall due to the unstable conditions ... we are also very concerned for the safety of the @entity1 coast guard as they continue to put forth a heroic effort in trying to find those who remain missing , " relatives wrote			0
experts say chances of finding survivors are slim			0
" i think you have to look at several issues			0
one is just the hypothermia			0
if a compartment is flooded , even if there was air , at this point , most of them would have succumbed to the hypothermic problem of the water temperature , " said @entity54 , president of the diving safety company @entity55			0
@entity64 , sister ship of the @entity7 , sailed by the wreckage wednesday night , safely navigating the waters around the island of @entity0			1
read more about the island that bears witness to tragedy the investigation is focusing on actions by @entity7 capt. @entity16			1
prosecutor @entity75 has accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers , causing the shipwreck , according to legal papers			1
judge @entity82 's initial ruling found @entity83 changed the ship 's course , steering too close to shore and causing the ship to hit a rock			1
the judge said the captain admitted to making a mistake and that , at the time of the collision , he was navigating by sight			1
@entity83 may face charges including manslaughter , shipwreck and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board , prosecutors said			1
read court documents on the case against @entity16 ( trans. by @entity104 ) in her preliminary investigation , @entity82 said there appears to be considerable evidence against the captain , whom she said showed " imprudence and inexperience			1
" the judge 's findings included : @entity83 made no serious attempt to return to the ship , he underestimated the damage to the @entity7 and he failed to alert authorities in a timely manner			1
" the captain could not but realize right away the gravity of the situation both because of the tilt and because he was alerted by the crew of the water influx , " @entity82 said			1
the captain abandoned ship while at least 100 people were still on board , the judge said			1
@entity82 described the shipwreck as " a disaster of global proportion			0
" @entity134 capt. @entity133 , speaking on behalf of @entity132 , an industry group , said crews must use available technologies , including radar and gps systems , and compare readings to nautical charts			0
looking out the bridge window is an aid to navigation , @entity133 said , but " that should absolutely by no means be your primary sense of position referencing			0
" the shipping industry newspaper @entity148 reported that friday was not the first time the @entity7 steamed extremely close to shore near @entity0			1
satellite tracking data obtained by the paper show that the ship passed within 230 meters ( 755 feet ) of the coast of the island at least once before , even closer than the location where the @entity7 hit the rocks lasted weekend			1
the pass happened on august 14 , 2011 , @entity148 reported			1
" it must have come within sniffing distance of the underwater rock that it hit on this voyage , " editor - in - chief @entity159 of @entity148 told @entity2 's @entity160 on wednesday night			1
@entity166 chairman @entity165 earlier this week said a pass near the island last summer occurred only once , on august 9 - 10 , 2011			1
the discrepancy in the dates could not be reconciled late wednesday			0
the pass occurred " under the authorization of the maritime authority , local maritime authority with the authority of the island aware , and with the permission of @entity64 , after having reviewed the route that the captain intended to take nearby the island , " @entity165 said , adding the vessel was observing @entity174 , known as night of the shooting stars			1
the executive said the pass was not to be within 500 meters of the island			0
@entity165 on monday placed the blame for the wreck squarely on the captain , saying it was his choice to deviate from frequently traveled routes			1
" we believe it has been a human error here , " @entity165 said			0
" the captain did not follow the authorized route , which is used by @entity64 ships very frequently			2
there 's probably more than 100 times in one year we have this route			2
" @entity83 was arrested after leaving the ship while dozens were still aboard , panicked and fighting for lifeboats			2
in transcripts of conversations between @entity83 and the @entity1 coast guard , published by the @entity1 daily newspaper @entity205 , the captain gives conflicting accounts of what happened when the ship hit the rocks friday night			1
at first , @entity83 tells an official he had abandoned the vessel , according to the transcripts , which prosecutors say match those used in their investigation			0
but as the official questions his decision , @entity83 appears to reverse himself and say he had not abandoned ship but was " catapulted into the water " after the ship ran into a rock , began taking on water and started listing			2
in a later conversation , an @entity1 coast guard official demands schettino return to his ship , the transcripts show			2
" you get on board ! this is an order ! " capt. @entity229 instructed @entity83			0
" you have declared ' @entity230			0
' now i 'm in charge			0
you get on board -- is that clear ? " the port official said			0
@entity229 's tough tone has been celebrated across @entity1 , with even a t - shirt on sale featuring another line he uttered to @entity83 : " get on board , damn it			2
" a facebook page praising @entity229 's comments had nearly 17,000 " likes " wednesday			2
there were roughly 4,200 people on the @entity7 when it ran aground -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members , the vast majority of whom made it off the ship safely			1
@entity1 prosecutors have ruled out a technical error as the cause of the incident , saying the captain was on the bridge at the time and had made a " grave error			1
" but they are examining whether others may share responsibility for the crash with the captain			2
@entity83 was transferred to house arrest , his lawyer , @entity266 , said			1
@entity82 justified the move on the grounds that the captain is not a flight risk and there is no danger of his interfering with evidence or committing the crime again			2
the captain was under house arrest in @entity276			1
in @entity278 , where he was meeting with @entity280 prime minister @entity279 , @entity1 prime minister @entity277 said he did not want to get ahead of the " multiple and meticulous inquiries " under way , but " obviously , any such disaster could and should be avoided			0
" he added that @entity1 authorities are also working to avoid any environmental damage as the result of the shipwreck			0
the company said it has hired a salvage company to recover the remaining fuel from the ship , with work beginning by the end of the week			2
@entity294 , whose brother @entity295 was a member of the crew , refused to give up hope			0
his brother was last seen helping passengers into lifeboats friday night			0
" miracles do happen , and let 's keep hope			2
i 'm not here to lose hope , " @entity294 said			0
@entity2 's @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 and @entity312 ; and journalist @entity313 contributed to this report .			2
