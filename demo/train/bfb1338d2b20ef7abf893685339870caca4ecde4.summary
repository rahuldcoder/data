-- a couple of weeks ago , @entity1 got a disturbing letter			0
it said that she no longer had health insurance -- and was required to as a graduate student at the @entity8 , @entity8			1
the problem was -- it was her own school 's insurance policy that was dropping her			2
@entity1 , 30 , was losing insurance because she had reached the lifetime limit of coverage under the @entity17 's student health insurance plan			1
she suffers from a rare disorder that requires her to get regular and expensive iv treatments every four weeks			0
without treatment for her chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy -- a disease that attacks her nervous system -- she has lost the ability to walk and has had to have a guest lecturer come in to teach her class			0
she said she ca n't understand why she 's in this predicament			2
" i initially thought @entity29 would take care of this , but somehow these schools have slipped out of it			0
i 'm extremely frustrated , " @entity1 said			0
" most people did n't know i was sick until this happened , and when i tell them why i 'm sick , they ca n't believe it			2
" had she been insured elsewhere , she might have been protected from losing her health care coverage			1
under the @entity39 administration 's @entity29 , or @entity29 , lifetime limits are supposed to be a thing of the past			1
but there are about 30 schools in the country , mostly in @entity45 and the @entity47 system , that offer students what is called self - funded student health insurance			1
instead of using an insurance company , a university runs the program , and student premiums directly pay for it			2
experts say it 's a complicated system to run , but it 's ultimately a lot cheaper for a school , because it eliminates the middleman of an insurance company			2
obamacare : a few changes coming in 2013 about 300,000 students are covered by these plans			1
a proposed ruling issued by the @entity39 administration wednesday determined these plans do count as " minimum essential coverage " but exempts them from having to meet the same standards of other health coverage			1
( the @entity72 offers a 60 - day period for public comments after publication in the @entity75 before issuing a final ruling			2
) the proposed rule means self - funded student health care plans can continue to cap benefits like they did in @entity1 's case			1
those self - funded student plans are the only insurance - type programs in the country that do n't have to provide the consumer protections guaranteed by the @entity29			1
" that 's because they are n't really insurance plans , " said @entity85 , director of federal relations , government and public affairs at the @entity89 , a group that represents the presidents of the nation 's higher education institutions			1
" they are not sold by an insurer			0
only students can buy the plans , and the schools pay for them			1
i know it acts like insurance , but under the law it is not technically insurance			2
" that 's a very lawyer - like explanation , is n't it ? but that 's what the law says , " @entity85 said			1
early in the discussion about these particular plans , @entity72 did n't think it had the power to regulate them , @entity85 said			1
" in order for these plans to have to follow the @entity29 , the regulations would probably have to change			0
" @entity120 , a lawyer and deputy director of the @entity122 , an advocacy group for young people , said , " they are certainly advertised to students as health insurance plans , and they are called insurance plans when you sign up for them			1
yes , there is a legal distinction here , but a legal technicality should n't shortchange students like this			1
" @entity120 added , " students do tend to be healthier than the general population , but there are occasions when a student gets sick			0
we want all students to have the same coverage everyone else has			2
" about 50 @entity8 , @entity144 students organized a rally in october to call for elimination of the lifetime caps on their student health insurance plans , and they 're circulating a petition			1
other schools in @entity45 are planning similar protests , @entity1 said			2
eliminating the caps could add expense to the programs though			0
and universities , in tight budgetary times , may not want to increase the cost			0
" universities are big businesses			0
people sometimes forget that when they see the tweed and the elbow patches , " said dr. @entity159 , a lawyer and physician who specializes in health care law and teaches at @entity162 in @entity163			0
" but this is about profit , and these schools are n't insulated from the economic realities			0
if there is a way to lower costs , they will do what they can			0
" opinion : ' @entity29 ' should be a @entity180 rallying cry in reading the @entity39 administration 's proposed rule from wednesday , @entity159 said he does believe @entity72 will continue to watch the situation carefully			1
" they do n't want anyone to have to go back to the old system , " he said			0
@entity85 added that these self - funded plans do generally offer good health coverage			1
" i do n't think you are seeing some kind of conspiracy in the way that the statutes are written			0
these plans are very comprehensive , " @entity85 said			0
" it does n't mean it 's not a tragedy if a student is in that situation where they come up against the caps , but in the grand scheme of things , this is a very small percentage of students that this impacts			1
you are talking about a fly on an elephant here			0
" but it 's big issue to @entity1 , who can not walk at the moment because she ca n't afford the treatment she needs without insurance			2
for now , she said she may have found an alternative insurance			0
it 's more expensive , but her mom will help with the bills			0
once she gets the treatment and can walk again , she said she will be out there protesting so other students wo n't experience what she did			1
" i mean , what is health insurance for if not to catch you in those rare cases when you do get sick ? " she asked			2
" this seems outrageous and is really truly mind - boggling			0

a proposal says self - funded *college* health plans count as " minimum essential coverage "
@entity39 administration : plans do n't have to meet same rules as other types of insurance
some @entity45 students are protesting lifetime caps on some of these plans
