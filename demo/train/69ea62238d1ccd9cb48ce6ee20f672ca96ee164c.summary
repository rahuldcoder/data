president @entity5 left office in 1949 making $ 100,000			1
when @entity8 entered the @entity9 in 1969 the salary went up to $ 200,000			2
it remained there for 30 years , until @entity12 doubled the presidential salary effective in 2001 , when president @entity14 took office			1
aside from the pay , there 's the free transportation in the presidential limousine , @entity20 and @entity21			2
and do n't forget the free housing in @entity0 's most famous mansion , complete with a killer view of the @entity25 , along with other perks ( a personal chef , for one )			2

president @entity45 's office in the pricey real estate market of @entity47 is $ 516,000			1
not too bad , huh ? but these taxpayer - funded benefits are nothing compared to the big bucks presidents rake in writing books			1
" @entity53 " netted @entity45 a $ 15 million advance			1
@entity14 earned $ 7 million for the first 1.5 million copies of " decision points			1
" @entity38 has written 14 books			0
" he was broke when he came out of the @entity9 , " presidential historian @entity57 said			0

" president @entity64 wrote " @entity65 " in his 30s			1
initially , it was only a modest success , selling better as his political star rose , flying off shelves when he ran for president			1
" i have been blessed , " he said on the campaign trail in 2008			0
" before this book started selling we were living in a condo and we had two cars , but one of them was beat up			0
" book sales are still the @entity81 ' main source of income			0
for the biggest payoff without too much work , speeches are the way to go			0
and @entity45 is the reigning king of the podium			2
right after @entity45 left the @entity9 in 2001 , the @entity88 paid him $ 125,000 for a speech , a very standard price for a former president			1
" i 've never had any money until i got out of the @entity9 , " @entity45 told @entity1 's @entity92 in 2010			2
" but i 've done reasonably well since then			0

all of that money raises questions			0
" i think the @entity108 people think @entity108 politics is all about money , " @entity57 said			0
" and this certainly does n't change their view			0
" in 1989 , right after president @entity114 left the @entity9 , he was lambasted for accepting $ 2 million for two speeches in @entity116 , then an economic foe of the @entity108			1
not all presidents have gotten rich after leaving office			1
@entity5 could n't afford to answer the copious mail he received or respond to requests for appearances			0
this prompted @entity12 to adopt pensions and benefits for former presidents in the 1950s so they were n't forced into activities deemed unsuitable for a former head of state			0
some presidents come into office already very rich			2
if elected , @entity133 presidential candidate @entity132 would fall into that category			0
with a net worth of about $ 200 million , he would be the third - richest president in history			2
adjusting for inflation , @entity137 and @entity138 were the richest people to become president			0
