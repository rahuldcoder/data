-- @entity1 spoke this weekend to the students at @entity3 , a hotbed of conservative studies , and he has been forced to think about his ties to the right			1
he is facing a difficult challenge in determining what his relationship should be with the tea party @entity12 who helped revitalize the @entity12 after the doldrums of 2008			1
although there are more conservative @entity12 grudgingly endorsing @entity1 and polls show that more tea party activists are coming to accept @entity1 as their candidate , there is strong evidence that there remains a great deal of distrust , which could dampen enthusiasm on the campaign trail and create tensions if mishandled			1
according to @entity29 , @entity28 rep. @entity27 told reporters , " i am not as excited as i am desperate " to elect someone other than @entity32			0
any misstep could cost @entity1 the election			1
if @entity1 is seen as too close to the tea party , he could easily undercut his ability to win independent votes in the swing states that will determine the outcome of the election			1
if @entity1 distances himself too much from the right wing of the party , he might dampen the enthusiasm that he needs to organize , to raise money and to make certain that people come out on @entity45 in what promises to be a close election			1
the challenge facing @entity1 is not new to @entity12 candidates			1
indeed , every @entity12 who has won office since the middle of the 20th century has confronted this dilemma			1
each successful candidate has handled the challenge in a different way			0
one model has been for candidates to completely distance themselves from the right and to instead allow the vice presidential candidate to focus on appealing to the base , to act as an " attack dog			1
" this is what the military hero @entity63 did in 1952 when he avoided associating with the @entity66 wing of the party that was ramping up @entity69 rhetoric			1
instead , gen. @entity63 let @entity70 do the dirty work , calling @entity73 candidate @entity72 " @entity77 " and tagging @entity74 as being a step away from communism			0
the @entity63 model would be difficult for @entity1 to follow			2
in the modern media age , especially after the @entity81 fiasco , there will be immense attention on whoever runs with @entity1			2
if he selects a right - wing nominee , the kind of scrutiny he or she will receive could easily overshadow @entity1 's campaign and any effort he hopes to make to appeal the center			1
the second model is @entity93 's full embrace of extremism in 1964			0
taking on president @entity95 , @entity93 ran as a true conservative who espoused right - wing values and had no interest in compromise			0
@entity93 used bold rhetoric , taking on programs like @entity103 and the @entity104 , demanding radical cuts in government			0
when liberal @entity12 @entity108 spoke at the @entity12 convention , the delegates booed and jeered			2
when @entity93 spoke , defending extremism , they burst out in applause			0
@entity93 doubled down with his vice presidential running mate , @entity113 rep. @entity112 , who further solidified @entity93 's image as the candidate who was far to the right			0
this model would certainly not work for @entity1 , who would come off as disingenuous			2
@entity1 has spent too much time positioning himself as a pragmatist and moderate to make this kind of move			2
trying to pull a @entity93 would only play into the accusations that he is a candidate without a core			0
the third option is the @entity126 model			0
in 1991 , @entity126 , who was not at all comfortable with the right wing of the party and never got the " vision thing , " ran a slash and burn campaign in 1988 that focused on devastating the record of @entity135 gov. @entity134			2
without fully embracing conservative ideals , @entity126 's campaign revolved around the depiction of his opponent as unpatriotic , as an extreme liberal and as someone not fit to be in office			0
while the strategy worked for @entity126 , it could be insufficient for @entity1 , who faces a much tougher opponent in president @entity32 , whose personal favorability ratings remain high and who has much stronger backing from his own party			1
the president wo n't be as easy to tear down			0
if @entity1 simply goes negative as a way to avoid dealing with the right wing of his party , his campaign could fail			1
the final model is the one used by @entity70 , @entity155 and @entity156			0
each of these candidates did send clear signals to the right that they would be an integral part of the coalition			0
none of these candidates fully distanced themselves from right - wing forces , yet their campaigns focused on broader themes that were attractive to a much bigger part of the population			2
@entity70 spoke of law and order in 1968 , @entity155 talked about anti-communism and private markets in 1980 , while @entity126 emphasized " compassionate conservatism " in 2000			0
this final strategy is the best path available to @entity1 , because it will allow him to send signals to the right that he understands what they are about and will be part of their coalition , while offering themes that can win over the rest of the @entity12 and perhaps even disaffected @entity74			1
the problem is that thus far @entity1 has struggled to find those themes			1
thus far he has focused mostly on castigating president @entity32			0
in the next few months leading into the @entity12 convention , he will have to lay out one or two broad themes that can extend his reach well beyond the right without alienating them			2
this is a difficult task and one that has been challenging to many @entity12			2
but doing so will be essential to handling the tea party republicans , who pose a massive challenge to his campaign			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			0

@entity200 : @entity1 faces a big challenge in trying to win enthusiastic tea party support
@entity12 presidential candidates have had different approaches to right wing *factions*
some have chosen to court the right wing , other have chosen to remain hands off , he says
@entity200 : @entity1 needs to find way to gain @entity204 support but not alienate the center
