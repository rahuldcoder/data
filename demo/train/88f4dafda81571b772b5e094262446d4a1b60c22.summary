@entity0 -- on the 47th anniversary of the 1963 march on @entity0 on saturday , the first sight on the @entity3 for thousands of marchers was a four - story art installation that displayed four images and quotations of @entity9			1
the participants in @entity12 's " @entity13 " rally paused as they walked toward the @entity14 and @entity15			1
some stopped to have pictures taken with @entity9 as the backdrop			1
as recordings of @entity9 's booming baritone filled the air , some of the @entity12 followers laughed and others booed			1
some looked for someone to argue their case that @entity9 's dream was pass√© , no more relevant to today 's politics than the race to the moon			1
@entity31 , an artist from @entity32 , created a four - story structure that celebrates @entity9 to honor @entity9 's spirit and to counter the rallies by @entity12 and the rev. @entity36			1
four images , each with passages from @entity9 's speeches , can be viewed from different perspectives			1
rev. @entity45 , speaking at a celebration of @entity9 's life near the temporary art installation , acknowledged the " angry discussions about the legacy of this man			1
" a @entity12 marcher ran up to someone admiring the art and called out : " we 'll be free again -- in november			1
" @entity54 's political atmosphere at the time of the @entity12 and @entity36 rallies sometimes seems more toxic than the politics of 1963			1
@entity12 has likened the policies of president @entity59 's administration to those of @entity61 and calls him a communist			1
some in the @entity64 movement have questioned @entity59 's patriotism and insinuated that he is an @entity66 sympathizer			2
in fact , the political climate surrounding @entity9 's 1963 march was tougher			1
but @entity9 and the civil rights movement provided a moral vision that made it possible for the @entity54 to find a way out of those ugly times			1
the summer of 1963 produced as much conflict as almost any other year in @entity54 history			2
after @entity9 's @entity79 , @entity78 , campaign , more than 2,000 demonstrations broke out across the nation			1
more than 50,000 people were jailed			2
@entity84 leader @entity83 was assassinated in @entity85			2
protesters in @entity87 , @entity88 , got pummeled within an inch of their lives , then subjected to persecution			2
the governor of @entity93 declared martial law in @entity95			2
that summer , the civil rights campaigners moved north			2
protests in @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 took a dramatic turn toward incivility			2
frustrated by years of inattention , renters in @entity99 dumped mountains of garbage in front of slumlords ' suburban homes			2
" you have n't got no time to cry no tears for no jews , " he called out at the @entity114			0
" why , they only killed 6 million @entity113			0
" meanwhile , segregationists were pushing constitutional amendments to overturn the principle of " one man , one vote , " to give state judges power over the @entity125 and to give states the power to amend the @entity128 without any federal involvement			0
@entity130 and @entity131 led an effort to throw the 1964 presidential election into the @entity134 so that @entity135 could determine the next president			0
radical groups of all stripes wanted to use the march to make history			0
the @entity140 and the @entity141 vowed to round up 10,000 or more white supremacists with the hope of inciting a conflict that would doom the civil rights cause			0
segregationists in @entity147 even expressed hope that violence would ruin the march and the civil rights movement			0
leftists , meanwhile , threatened to occupy the offices of segregationists on @entity155 and vent their anger at the @entity134 and @entity157			0
the @entity158 denounced " the farce on @entity0 , " and @entity112 came to razz the marchers			0
and on the edges of the movement , @entity161 tried to work their way into the march			0
but amid what @entity166 called @entity54 's second @entity168 , the civil rights movement embraced the idea that the best way to gain rights was to appeal to everyone 's hearts and meet " physical force with soul force , " as @entity9 put it			1
@entity9 himself did not always understand the imperative of love or nonviolence			1
as a young man , he later acknowledged , he hated whites			0
and he did not understand nonviolence right away either			2
in the early days of the @entity185 , he hired men to guard his house with guns			0
by the time of the march , @entity9 understood that @entity54 could be changed only by winning over the other side			1
@entity9 understood that fighting violence with violence created only more violence			1
he knew that , whatever happened , blacks and whites needed to live together			0
one marcher who " won " a train ticket to the march on @entity0 for his courageous conduct in demonstrations , later remembered the time racist thugs threw beer mugs at marchers in @entity204			0
his first reaction , @entity206 told me , was to stiffen up to be ready for a fight			0
@entity9 planted himself in front of @entity206			1
" if you do n't think you can respond nonviolently , maybe you should leave the march , " @entity9 said			1
@entity9 's cause was moral , universal			1
he sought nothing for his people that other people did not enjoy			2
he wanted access to lunch counters and bus stations , the right to vote , equal access to schools , protection against mobs , fair police treatment			0
and @entity9 was willing -- and insisted that his followers be willing -- to suffer for the cause			1
everyone remembers @entity9 's speech at the march for four words : " @entity231			1
" and , in fact , those words were transcendent			0
they conjured up images of a better world			0
those words connected the ordinary struggles of the movement -- brutally hard work rewarded with beatings and jail -- with the glorious possibilities of equality			0
but even more important were four other words : " unearned suffering is redemptive			0
" @entity9 warned that even the most innocent and decent people would continue to suffer			1
oppressors never yield power willingly			0
move ahead , first into the swinging batons and electric cattle prods and water cannons			0
because there is no other way			0
@entity9 could issue that challenge			1
he could be that blunt and honest because of the universal values he espoused			0
they were not fighting for an earmark or a tax cut , loopholes from an @entity262 regulations , a @entity264 grant or a @entity266 subsidy			0
they were fighting for their lives			0
it all seems so clear now , but it was n't back in 1963 , not for most people anyway			2
but the existence of this massive movement , with hundreds of thousands of ordinary people willing to put their bodies on the line with nonviolence and even love , created real light in what could have been the darkest of times			2
who 's our @entity9 ? who is drawing on the power of soul force ? who is appealing to his bitterest enemies ? who today is pointing to a new age of cooperation and brotherhood ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity294 .			1

people arriving for the @entity12 rally were *greeted* by a tribute to @entity9
@entity294 says @entity9 's *message* is still relevant today
he says @entity9 had to *confront* a much more *rancorous* political climate than today 's
@entity9 *overcame* oppression through nonviolence , he says ; where is today 's @entity9 ?
