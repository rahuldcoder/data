it was a disappointing week for the women of the @entity2			0
all three -- justices @entity3 , @entity5 and @entity6 -- were on the losing side of rulings involving women 's reproductive health			1
first came the @entity12 decision , in which the high court decided 5 - 4 that the government can not force certain for - profit companies to offer contraception coverage under @entity17			1
@entity2 rules against @entity18 in contraception case then another decision emerged late on thursday in which a @entity22 - area evangelical college won a temporary victory over the requirement in the 2010 health care law that religious non-profits provide contraception insurance to their workers			2
@entity30 objected to potential fines if it refused to provide coverage or sign a release form , arguing that doing so would be morally wrong			2
the @entity2 said the college did n't have to do either for now			0
strident dissent coming after the @entity12 decision , narrowly defined to the specifics of cases involving two businesses run by families with strong @entity43 beliefs , the @entity30 ruling rankled the three liberal women justices			1
their unusually forceful dissent written by @entity6 said the @entity30 injunction threatened the credibility of the @entity12 decision			2
" those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word , " @entity6 wrote			1
" the point of the dissent ? " it is not the business of this court to ensnare itself in the government 's ministerial handling of its affairs in the manner it does here , " @entity6 wrote			1
@entity12 ruling much more than abortion while the @entity30 ruling only gives the school a pass until the matter is decided by lower courts , it represents an important victory for those objecting to the contraception coverage requirement			0
the mandate was a negotiated compromise between the @entity18 administration and religious - based non-profits such as hospitals and faith - based universities that oppose birth control			2
it made contraceptives available under the @entity17 with no co-pay , but gave those entities a work - around through health plans written by third parties			1
legal challenges since the law championed by president @entity18 took effect , the contraceptive coverage requirement has faced several challenges , including a case last year by the religious charity @entity95			0
as in @entity30 , the @entity2 said the government could n't enforce the contraceptive mandate			0
religious - based groups sought delays in the requirement that took effect july 1 , saying that signing the form would force them to choose between what the @entity95 -- a @entity105 - based home for the elderly run by @entity108 nuns -- called " onerous penalties or becoming complicit in a grave moral wrong			0
" the high court ruling in the @entity30 appeal said those who object only have to inform the government " in writing that it is a nonprofit organization that holds itself out as religious and has religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services , " rather than sign government form			1
what the @entity2 's @entity12 decision means the ruling also made clear the high court had yet to decide the larger legal and constitutional issues , but merely acted on the enforcement question			1
the issue could be presented to the justices in coming months for final review			0
" we are grateful to @entity131 that the @entity2 has made a wise decision in protecting our religious liberty - at least until we have an opportunity to make our full case in court , " said @entity30 president @entity129			0
" we continue to believe that a college community that affirms the sanctity of human life from conception to the grave should not be coerced by the government into facilitating the provision of abortion - inducing drugs			0
" @entity30 is a private @entity43 liberal arts school located in a @entity22 suburb , and is represented in court by the @entity148 , which also represented @entity12 -- an @entity150 chain of 572 retail outlets -- and the @entity95			0
the @entity12 ruling monday authored by justice @entity153 suggested the two for - profit companies could sign the same government form as the religious non-profits			0
" @entity158 costs " in the dissent of thursday 's ruling , @entity6 expressed concern the court no longer required use of the form by any institution			1
" the court 's actions in this case create unnecessary costs and layers of bureaucracy , and they ignore a simple truth : the government must be allowed to handle the basic tasks of public administration in a manner that comports with common sense , " the dissent said			1
" the court 's grant of an injunction in this case allows @entity30 's beliefs about the effects of its actions to trump the democratic interest in allowing the government to enforce the law , " it continued			2
@entity12 : the @entity191 verses behind the battle a mennonite family 's fight over @entity17 reaches @entity2 the @entity195 previously said the contraceptive coverage requirement in @entity17 was lawful and " essential to a woman 's health , " and that its rules struck the right balance			1
there was no immediate reaction about the thursday court order from the administration			0
abortion rights groups expressed disappointment , with the @entity207 calling the court order " alarming " because it confirmed " that many more women may lose access to birth control coverage in the coming months and years if @entity211 does not act soon			1
" while @entity216 members of @entity211 are proposing fixes to the health care law to address the issue , the chances of such legislation passing in an election year are considered low due to opposition by conservative @entity221			0
court rulings : it 's @entity224 v. @entity216 how @entity17 can reduce abortions			2

three women justices dissent against high court 's latest @entity17 order
@entity6 : those bound by decisions ca n't take take us at our word
the cases involve *exceptions* to a mandate to provide health coverage for contraceptives
supporters say the decisions uphold religious rights ; foes say they hurt women 's rights
