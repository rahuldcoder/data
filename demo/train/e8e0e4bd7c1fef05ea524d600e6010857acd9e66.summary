-- in 1951 , a doctor at @entity2 removed two thin slivers of tissue from a dying woman 's cervix			2
cells from that biopsy would later multiply wildly and continuously -- a feat never seen until that time -- and become the cornerstone of research for diseases ranging from polio to @entity15			2
the woman 's name was @entity18			1
the cells , culled from her cancerous cervical tumor , are called @entity21			1
" her cells were part of research into the genes that cause cancer and those that suppress it ; they helped develop drugs for treating herpes , leukemia , influenza , hemophilia , and parkinson 's disease , " wrote @entity22 in her book , " @entity23			2
" " they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine : the polio vaccine , chemotherapy , cloning , gene mapping , in vitro fertilization			2
" hela cells are arguably one of the most important contributions to medicine ever made			1
and they 're still the most commonly used cells in research today , @entity22 told @entity0			2
but although the cells have been a boon for the scientific community , they have been a persistent source of pain for the @entity18 family			1
@entity18 had no clue her cells would be used for research , and neither did her family			1
decades after her death , scientists took tissue samples from other members of the @entity18 family and tested them , never disclosing why they were doing it			1
for years companies have capitalized on discoveries made because of hela cells , and the family has not received any compensation			1
the third blow came earlier this year when scientists in @entity73 revealed that they had mapped the full @entity21 genome and posted the results to a public database			2
the lacks family did not consent to release the information			0
" it was repeating this history , this chapter of the family being thrust into some kind of research without their consent , " said @entity22			0
but a new agreement between the @entity90 and the @entity18 family , the details of which were published in the journal nature wednesday , is meant to alter the narrative about @entity21			1
as part of the agreement , the @entity90 and the @entity18 family will control access to the @entity21 genome -- including an even more specific analysis recently completed by scientists at the @entity102 -- so that researchers receiving @entity90 funds would have to apply to use the data			1
labs not funded by the @entity90 would not be required to adhere to the agreement			0
" we urge the research community to act responsibly and honor the family 's wishes , " said @entity108 , deputy director for science , outreach and public policy at the @entity90 and @entity112 , director of the agency , in a commentary published in @entity93			0
" downloading the @entity21 sequence through controlled access is the right and respectful thing to do			0
" in some respects , the damage is done			0
snippets of information about the @entity21 genome have been widely reported over the years , and with them , sensitive information about the diseases to which the @entity18 family may be susceptible			1
" what happened with @entity18 is beyond - the - pale horrible , and we do n't want that to happen again , " said dr. @entity131 , director of the masters of @entity132 at @entity133 and author of " @entity138 ? : confronting @entity139 and family secrets in the @entity141			1
" " we owe it to people to give them a choice : ' do you want to do this research even if it is a potential risk to your privacy ? ' " the privacy problem is not unique to the @entity18 family			1
parents shocked to learn examiner kept son 's brain for patients , a routine hospital visit to draw blood or excise a growth could result in excess cells or tissue being stored and later used for research , albeit with identifying information removed			1
" let 's say scientists have all this leftover blood containing patients ' genes and next year they discover that a certain mutation makes someone more likely to get a disease , but we never asked you if you want us to look at your blood , " said @entity131			2
we have hundreds of thousands of specimens of @entity174 , so this is going to be a major ongoing problem			0
" a report issued in 1999 by the @entity178 estimates that more than 307 million tissue specimens are stored in the @entity180 , with approximately 20 million added annually			0
conventional wisdom has been that as long as the samples are anonymous , even if the genetic information is shared publicly , the patient is protected			0
not necessarily , says @entity131			0
using current technology , some of which is easily found on the @entity189 , genetic information could be paired with seemingly insignificant demographic information to stitch together a person 's identity			0
in july 2011 , the @entity193 proposed rules to protect patients whose genetic material could be used for study , and invited public comment			0
according to the notice , " ... rapidly evolving advances in technology coupled with the increasing volume of data readily available may soon allow identification of an individual from data that is currently considered de-identified			2
" but since the notice was issued , " no resolution has been released , " said @entity131 , leaving a gaping hole in protections for patients			1
" future cures will come of this , " said @entity22			0
" but it needs to be handled in a way that protects people 's privacy so people know what they 're getting into when they donate			0
we are n't in a place where people understand what 's happening			0
" as for the family whose experience sparked this whole debate , their agreement with the @entity90 gives a sense about where they stand			0
the lacks family is willing to give scientists what they want , provided their genetic information is respected			2
" they get so much pride out of what hela cells have done for society and the world , " said @entity22			1
" they want hela cells to continue to do good			1
they just want to be part of the conversation			0

scientists took cells from @entity18 ' cancerous cervical tumor in 1951
those cells , called hela cells , have been used in many scientific discoveries
the family is *concerned* about their privacy , and has not been compensated
advances in technology have left a gaping hole in privacy protections for patients
