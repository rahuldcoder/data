-- the @entity2 will " substantially reduce " the use of chimpanzees in @entity2 - funded biomedical research and retire most of the chimps it currently owns or supports , the agency said wednesday			1
@entity2 director @entity9 accepted most of the recommendations issued in january by an @entity2 working group , according to an @entity2 statement			1
" @entity13 have benefited greatly from the chimpanzees ' service to biomedical research , but new scientific methods and technologies have rendered their use in research largely unnecessary , " @entity9 said			1
" their likeness to humans has made them uniquely valuable for certain types of research , but also demands greater justification for their use			0
" the agency will , however , " retain but not breed " up to 50 chimpanzees for future biomedical research , the @entity2 said			1
those that remain available for research will be selected based on research projects meeting the @entity33 's principles and criteria for @entity2 funding			1
that 's in line with the working group 's report , which suggested about 50 chimps be kept for potential research needs			1
chimpanzees share about 99 % of their dna with humans			0
hundreds of research chimps may be retired the january recommendations were issued regarding about 360 chimpanzees owned by the @entity2 , classified as either " research active " or " research inactive			1
" another 91 chimps eligible for research live at the @entity52 in @entity53			2
officials said in january the @entity2 supports their maintenance but could not itself retire the animals			0
a separate group of 219 @entity2 - supported chimpanzees was previously retired and lives at @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 , or the @entity62 at the @entity63			0
@entity59 operates the @entity64 , established in 2002 and overseen by the @entity2			0
about 150 chimps are in the sanctuary system			0
the @entity52 , however , said it was " disappointed " in the @entity2 response to the recommendations			1
while it agrees with chimps should be provided with " an appropriate environment , " and said some important biomedical research can be conducted with a pool of 50 chimps , " this arbitrarily chosen number is not sufficient to enable the rapid development of better preventions and cures for hepatitis b and @entity76 , which kill a million people every year , " the institute said			1
fifty chimps is also not enough to ensure progress in testing aimed at treating autoimmune diseases and some forms of cancer , it said , or even to research prevention and cures of diseases including ebola hemorrhagic fever and chimpanzee @entity94 , " which are contributing to the extinction of chimpanzees and gorillas			0
" as the number of available chimpanzees drops below 50 as the animals die due to natural causes , the pace of research " will be slowed even more , and human and chimpanzee lives will be lost unnecessarily due to delays in bringing new drugs and vaccines to market , " the institute said in a statement			2
@entity112 chimps wo n't be used in additional research , pending review the @entity33 , it noted , recognized that new or re-emerging diseases may require the use of chimps , and recommended @entity2 establish a breeding program for future research needs			1
in its statement , the @entity2 also pledged to provide facilities similar to those chimps would encounter in their natural environments , with space requirements yet to be determined ; and " wind down " research projects using @entity2 - owned or supported chimps that " do not meet @entity33 principles and criteria in a way that preserves the research and minimizes the impact on the animals			1
" a provision currently limits the amount of funding @entity2 may put toward retiring chimps and caring for them in the @entity64			2
the agency said it would continue working with @entity140 to remedy that			0
but , said @entity52 , " we are disappointed that the @entity2 intends to transfer the remaining @entity2 - owned and @entity2 - supported chimpanzees to the federal sanctuary and to seek additional taxpayer money from @entity140 for that purpose			2
" sending most of the animals to the sanctuary " would take them away from their caregivers , many of whom they have known all of their lives , " the institute said			0
" it would also deprive them of the state - of - the - art medical and diagnostic capabilities that have been developed at chimpanzee research facilities over several decades with taxpayer money			0
" the @entity2 decision " culminates more than two years of intensive deliberations among @entity2 leadership , independent chimpanzee experts , researchers , bioethicists and members of the public , " said dr. @entity157 , @entity2 's deputy director for program coordination , planning and strategic initiatives , in the statement			1
@entity157 's division oversees the @entity171			0
restricted use of chimps in government research recommended a study was commissioned in december 2010 to examine the " continued scientific need " for chimpanzees in @entity2 - funded research			1
a year later , the @entity33 said most current use of chimps in biomedical research was unnecessary , and the use that was needed should be guided by principles and criteria			2
the advisory committee began its work the same month and presented its report in january			0
recently , the @entity188 issued a proposed rule listing captive chimpanzees and endangered			0
" @entity2 expects to adapt its policies for research projects using chimpanzees to comply with the conservation guidelines that the @entity188 establishes in a potential final rule , " according to the @entity2 statement			2
laboratory chimps get new lease on life @entity0 's @entity201 and @entity202 contributed to this report .			0

chimps ' use in medical research is " largely unnecessary , " says @entity2 director
the agency will retain , but not breed , about 50 chimps for future needs
a @entity215 research institute says it 's " disappointed " with the @entity2 decision
