@entity0 , @entity1 -- a military jury on friday convicted @entity5 maj. @entity4 of 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in a shooting rampage at @entity0 , @entity1 , making it possible for the death penalty to be considered as a punishment			1
the jurors deliberated less than seven hours over two days before finding @entity4 guilty on all charges in connection with the november 5 , 2009 , shootings at a deployment process center			1
the @entity5 psychiatrist admitted to targeting soldiers he was set to deploy with to @entity21 , saying previously he wanted to protect the @entity22 and its leaders from the @entity25 military			2
under the rules of a military court - martial , the jury must return a unanimous verdict of premeditated murder for the death penalty to be considered as a punishment option			1
the jury is not required to tell the court whether they reached a unanimous verdict on the attempted murder charges			2
the court - martial moves on monday to the penalty phase , where @entity4 -- acting as his own attorney -- will have the opportunity to address the jurors considering whether he should be executed for his actions			1
as has been done nearly every day in the three - week court - martial , the judge asked @entity4 if he had reconsidered defending himself as the case enters the penalty phase			1
jurors " will decide whether you live or die , " the judge , col. @entity50 , told @entity4 after reconvening the court monday afternoon as part of the penalty phase preparation			1
" ... i think it is unwise for you to represent yourself			0
" @entity4 told the judge he intended to continue acting as his own attorney			1
courtroom reaction inside the courtroom , the judge warned the audience in the gallery , including family members of those killed , before the verdict was announced that outbursts and reactions to the verdict would not be tolerated			2
@entity4 stroked his beard as the jury -- a military panel of 13 senior officers -- filed into the courtroom			1
he then looked at the head of the jury -- a colonel -- who affirmed a verdict had been reached			0
@entity4 showed no emotion as the verdict was read , a contrast to a handful of some of family members who cried or gave one another brief hugs			1
" today 's guilty verdict , rendered almost four years after the attack , is only a first , small step down the path of justice for the victims , " said attorney @entity80 , who represents victims and families of those killed in a compensation claim against the government for failing to stop the attack			0
almost immediately after the attacks , there were widespread questions about how @entity4 was evaluated , promoted and transferred to @entity0 with plans to deploy to @entity21 despite questions about his actions , including giving an academic presentation on the value of suicide bombings			1
@entity80 renewed the call for the government to reclassify the shootings as a " terror attack " rather than workplace violence			0
" justice for the victims of @entity0 will be done only when the government admits its mistakes , keeps its promises to ' make the victims whole ' and comes clean about @entity0 , " @entity80 said			0
" the victims , and the @entity25 people , are owed nothing less			0
" the husband of @entity116 , a former private who testified about the wounds she received during the attack , said the death penalty " would be too lenient " for @entity4			1
" i would much rather see him sit in prison for the rest of his life			0
he should n't be allowed to dictate what happens			0
he wants to motivate other terrorists , " @entity124 told @entity2 by telephone			0
@entity4 does n't call witnesses , give closing argument on thursday afternoon , the judge handed the case to the jury after @entity4 declined to make a statement during closing arguments that followed 12 days of testimony			1
the prosecution urged the jury to convict , saying the evidence showed that he believed he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible			0
" there is no doubt , as i said in the beginning , the accused is the shooter , " the prosecutor , col. @entity139 , told the jury			0
" the only question for you is ... is this a premeditated design to kill ? " for more than 90 minutes , the prosecutor took the jury methodically through the evidence in the case , meticulously piecing together how he says @entity4 prepared and planned for the attack			1
soldier on soldier attacks @entity152 prosecutors have maintained that the @entity25 - born @entity154 underwent a progressive radicalization that led to the massacre at the sprawling central @entity1 base			0
" he did not want to deploy , and he came to believe he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible , " @entity139 told the jury			0
@entity4 picked the day -- november 5 , 2009 -- because it was when the units he was scheduled to deploy with to @entity21 were scheduled to go through the processing center , he said			1
@entity4 rested his case without calling a single witness or taking the stand to testify on his own behalf			1
his decision not to offer a defense was an anticlimactic end to the trial in which prosecution witnesses , primarily survivors , painted a horrific picture of what unfolded inside a processing center during the attack			0
a graphic @entity179 video during closing arguments during closing arguments , prosecutors showed a graphic @entity179 video of the crime scene hours after the rampage , where bodies , blood and bullets still covered the floor			0
as the video was shown to the jury , some of the family members of those killed fought back tears			0
one woman laid her head on her husband 's shoulder , tears pouring down her cheeks , while another woman , a wife of a victim , left the courtroom			1
for his part , @entity4 watched the video , appearing to pay close attention			2
@entity4 , who has insisted that the jury not be allowed to consider lesser charges against him , said his attack on soldiers at @entity0 was not an act of " sudden passion			2
" @entity0 victims feel betrayed there was " adequate provocation " for the attack because the soldiers were going to participate in " an illegal war " in @entity21 , @entity4 told the military judge wednesday , arguing against the jury being allowed to consider voluntary manslaughter or unpremeditated murder			1
prosecutors argued against the inclusion of lesser charges , saying the attack was n't carried out in " the heat of sudden passion , " and @entity4 said he agreed			2
the judge ruled that the jurors can consider a lesser charge of unpremeditated murder but not voluntary manslaughter			1
they can also consider unpremeditated attempted and other lesser charges , she ruled			0
@entity4 's defense much has been made of @entity4 's defense or , as his stand - by attorneys have said , the lack of it			2
judge @entity50 declined a request by @entity4 's attorneys to drop out of the case			1
the attorneys argued that @entity4 was helping the prosecution put him to death			1
there may be something to that claim			0
@entity4 took credit for the shooting rampage at the outset of the trial , telling the jury during opening statements that the evidence will show " i was the shooter			2
" @entity50 barred @entity4 from pleading guilty at the start of the court - martial			2
under military law , defendants can not enter guilty pleas in capital punishment cases			0
the judge has refused to allow @entity4 to argue " defense of others , " a claim that he carried out the shootings to protect the @entity21 @entity22 and its leaders from @entity25 soldiers			1
perhaps as a way around that ruling , @entity4 in recent days has leaked documents through his civilian attorney to the @entity269 and @entity270 that offer a glimpse of his justification for carrying out the attack			2
among the documents was a mental health evaluation conducted by a military panel to determine whether @entity4 was fit to stand trial			2
" i do n't think what i did was wrong because it was for the greater cause of helping my @entity154 brothers , " he told the panel , according to pages of the report published by @entity269			0
he also said , according to the documents : " i 'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life			0
however , if i died by lethal injection , i would still be a martyr			0
" prosecutors call dozens of witnesses military prosecutors called 89 witnesses and submitted more than 700 pieces of evidence before resting their case			0
the judge excluded much of the evidence that the prosecution contends goes to the heart of the motive for the attack , including e-mail communications between @entity4 and @entity303 , the @entity25 - born cleric who officials say became a key member of @entity306			1
he was killed in a @entity25 drone strike in 2011			0
@entity50 also declined to allow prosecutors to use materials they maintain showed @entity4 's interest in the actions of @entity5 sgt. @entity312 , the @entity25 soldier sentenced to death for killing two soldiers and wounding more than a dozen others at the start of the @entity318 war , an attack he said he carried out to stop soldiers from killing @entity154			1
along with the e-mails and the material related to @entity312 , @entity50 declined to allow the use of @entity4 's academic presentation on suicide bombings , saying " motive is not an element of the crime			2
