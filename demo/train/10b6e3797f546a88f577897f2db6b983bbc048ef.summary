-- a strong , politically savvy woman is just what @entity2 and the @entity3 need to strengthen relations on both sides of the @entity7			1
@entity8 , who is in line for the post of @entity3 ambassador to @entity2 , may or may not exactly fit that bill			1
with any luck , though , she could leverage her appointment as @entity16 's top envoy to @entity17 to heighten awareness of just how seriously both sides need to take the issue of female leadership			0
not that there is a dearth of other pressing problems at stake			0
@entity27 's nuclear aspirations show no sign of abating , while worries about tensions in the @entity32 over a handful of barren rocks possibly triggering armed conflict between @entity2 and @entity36 persist			2
meanwhile , an arms race is building up in the @entity7 , and the @entity3 needs to strengthen ties with solid allies such as @entity2 more than ever			1
a skillful diplomat should be able to navigate those choppy waters under the leadership of the @entity44 administration			0
where an ambassador can make a real difference in bilateral relations is in highlighting issues that are not necessarily being pushed forward by her bosses at the @entity51			0
for @entity8 , her cause should rightly be unleashing the power of women in @entity2 and the @entity3			1
@entity2 is woefully behind most other industrialized countries -- and developing nations alike			2
according to the @entity58 's 2012 gender equity survey , it ranks in 101st place among 135 countries			1
the @entity3 , meanwhile , comes in as number 22 , and @entity63 countries dominate the top tier of the ranking that measures women 's economic opportunities , education , health and political empowerment			2
more than 60 % of @entity2 women work , while nearly 70 % of their @entity3 counterparts are in the workforce			1
what 's particularly worrisome , though , is that while women make up about 15 % of upper management and company boards in the @entity3 , they account for about 2 % in @entity2 , according to the consultancy group @entity80 's june 2012 report women matter : an @entity82			1
that means the @entity3 is hardly a role model when it comes to female leadership , and both @entity2 and the @entity3 can encourage one another to go beyond simply discussing women joining the workforce			1
what both countries need now is to ensure greater diversity in leadership positions , from the corridors of power to executive board rooms			0
certainly in @entity2 , women are as well - educated as men , but face major obstacles in climbing up the corporate ladder once they get married or after they have children			2
not only does @entity2 need major policy overhaul to encourage more women to be more ambitious professionally , but there also needs to be a significant shift in mindset to convince women that they can and should strive for economic empowerment			2
at 1.39 children per women , @entity2 's birthrate is one of the lowest in the world			2
meanwhile , nearly a quarter of the population is older than 65 , while the number of immigrants in the country remains below 2 % , according to the @entity118			0
clearly , that equation does not make for a robust economy			0
pushing for the best and brightest women to be more ambitious , and giving them the opportunity to shine , should be a national priority			2
the @entity3 is ahead of @entity2 when it comes to acknowledging the potential of female corporate and political leaders , but it pales in comparison to @entity130 countries			1
both the @entity3 and @entity2 have a long way to go to reach gender parity , and both can work together to change the mindset toward female leadership			1
as @entity138 's only daughter , @entity8 's personal experiences hardly resonate with the average woman			0
yet she has enjoyed access to some of the world 's most powerful and inspiring people since an early age , and she can leverage her position as ambassador to highlight what women in @entity2 and the @entity3 can aspire			1
@entity8 could encourage high - powered women such as @entity151 's chief operating officer , @entity150 , to spread a @entity3 brand of self - made powerful women who have prospered in places such as @entity155			1
she could reach out to people such as former secretary of state @entity157 to talk about her personal struggles in juggling personal ambition and family needs , which will resonate with all women regardless of nationality or economic status			0
@entity8 's biggest personal challenge would be to come out of her father 's shadow and establish herself as a top diplomat in her own right			0
her posting to one of the potentially most explosive regions in the world today highlights @entity44 's confidence in her leadership potential			0
@entity2 has a very long way to go to for gender equality			2
the @entity3 does much better , but it could do more as well			0
both countries can acknowledge that there is a problem and be open to learning from nations that have encouraged female leadership and success to blossom			0
given @entity8 's high profile , she could shed light on the issue and push for concrete action			0
and by being humble and acknowledging @entity3 's failings in promoting women to leadership positions , @entity8 would avoid the label of trying to impose @entity3 values on her host country			1
by becoming a champion of female leadership in @entity2 and the @entity3 , @entity8 could leave a powerful legacy of helping to enhance @entity3 - @entity2 relations			1

@entity2 is far behind other nations in giving women leadership roles in business , she says
