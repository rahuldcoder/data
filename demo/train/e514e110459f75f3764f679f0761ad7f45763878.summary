-- it 's ugly out there			0
and it 's only getting uglier			0
tuesday has been a mess for much of the @entity5			1
a massive storm that started in @entity7 soaked a huge swath from @entity9 to @entity10 , with snow and sleet falling in pockets of @entity14 and @entity15			1
this system is n't going away anytime soon			1
in fact , it could cause even more problems and headaches on wednesday , especially if you are among the thousands at airports waiting and waiting and waiting to fly home for @entity25			1
that 's because winds are forecast to pick up and sock densely populated places in the @entity29 in the next day or so			1
for drivers , big gusts mixed with drenching rains can slow things down any day			1
for air travelers , there is always a big trickle - down effect when places like @entity15 's @entity39 and @entity40 airports or those in @entity43 and @entity44 experience wind delays			1
when this kind of stuff happens on one of the biggest travel days of the year ? let 's just say people along the @entity5 may have many good reasons to give thanks this holiday season			1
but the weather likely wo n't be one of them			0
do n't get trapped by bad @entity25 weather : top tips storm blamed for wrecks , deaths the expected issues should n't overshadow what this storm has already done , and continued to do tuesday			1
the system started on the @entity65 , proving its might from the get - go			2
a 52 - year - old man in @entity69 , @entity7 , died thursday when a tree fell on top of a vehicle , a county sheriff 's office said			0
road conditions were blamed for the deaths of two people in @entity77			2
three people were killed in an icy pileup along @entity80 late friday in northwest @entity81			2
the weather also was blamed for four deaths in @entity84 since late last week those were just some of the casualties from a storm that has led to more than 100 wrecks			1
there was more where that came from tuesday			2
one stretch of the the @entity93 , about 20 miles east of @entity94 , saw a little of everything over the course of the day -- snow , rain , ice -- according to @entity0 's @entity101			1
@entity102 was the issue for cities and towns along the @entity106 , all the way down to @entity108			1
parts of @entity110 , including @entity111 and @entity112 , were seeing flakes on tuesday night			2
still , it was n't -- or at least wo n't be -- especially chilly everywhere			0
the @entity115 forecast temperatures to rise into the 50s during the night in @entity43 and @entity44			0
but there , the temperature wo n't be the story so much as the wind speed			2
sustained winds in @entity15 -- where the thermostat should hit 55 degrees by 5 a.m. -- will reach 19 to 24 mph , with gusts blowing as strong as 55 mph			1
it will not be much better thursday , when the forecast calls for breezes from the west at 21 to 24 mph , with more potent gusts			0
forget the rain : that wind could hamper the @entity131 through the streets of @entity133			1
the giant balloons that are the parade 's trademarks -- featuring characters from @entity137 to @entity138 to the @entity139 -- wo n't soar if sustained winds exceed 23 mph that day , because of fears that the balloon handlers wo n't be able to control them			2
" we have a sergeant assigned to each of the balloons , " @entity15 police commissioner @entity144 said			0
" they can be lowered all the way to the ground if the determination is made not to fly them			0
" slick roads , high winds chances are no one will miss the gigantic balloon versions of @entity158 or @entity159 around the dinner table on thursday			2
but the same might not hold true for hundreds trying to fly out on airplanes over the coming days			0
# @entity163 : a day in the life of the world 's busiest airport as of tuesday night , the weather 's effect on flights was fairly minimal			1
as of 10:30 p.m. , 158 flights had been canceled nationwide with another 84 scuttled wednesday , according to the air travel tracking website @entity172			1
the highest number of @entity174 cancellations with 28 so far is northern @entity176 's @entity175 , the site says			0
there is a possibility this situation could turn for the worst , quickly , leading to major delays if not more cancellations			0
@entity0 's meteorology unit estimates , if winds blow as forecast , @entity185 airports could see average delays of two to three hours , and @entity44 's @entity189 could be even worse			2
this would n't just affect those flying in and out of those airports , or others like @entity195 's @entity194 or @entity196 that could be similarly affected			0
there 's a ripple effect because of the logistics of carefully coordinated schedules and connecting flights that could affect many of the 3.14 million people that @entity204 projects will fly this weekend			1
in expectation of such headaches , major airlines like @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 have already relaxed their policies by letting some customers change their reservations without a fee			0
storm prompts airlines to relax travel policies still , the vast majority of travelers -- 43.4 million , by @entity204 's count -- wo n't be in the air , but on the road			0
for them , the combination of strong winds and slick surfaces , even if they are n't coated with snow or ice , could lead to problems			1
in other words , make a plan if you will be among these millions over the next few days , packing snacks and patience in case you come to a crawl			0
and , as always , drive safely			0
5 healthy eating tips for holiday travelers @entity0 's @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity244 contributed to his report .			0
