-- the publication of a report into child abuse in the northern town of @entity6 , @entity1 has shocked @entity7 to the core			1
the report , by professor @entity9 , gives a " conservative estimate " of 1,400 children being sexually assaulted over a 16 - year period			1
they were beaten , kidnapped , raped and trafficked			2
some victims were as young as 11			2
how could it happen here , in a modern country that professes to care for the vulnerable ? the horrors in @entity6 first came to light in 2010 , when five men were jailed for sexual offenses against underage girls			1
a journalist 's investigation into the wider scale of abuse prompted the local council to conduct its own report -- and it 's the staggering numbers revealed in @entity9 's findings that have caught the public 's attention			1
many of the headlines have focused on the racial makeup of the culprits , who were overwhelmingly @entity38 males			2
the report concludes that elected council officials were reluctant to talk directly to the @entity42 community about the problem and that some staff were frightened of being labeled " racist " for doing so			1
all of which confirms the assertion from the @entity7 right wing that a climate of " political correctness " permitted the abuse to go on			1
it 's impossible not to infer that children could have been rescued had quaint notions of " racial sensitivity " been put aside			1
the inquiry heard that influential elected @entity42 councilors acted as " barriers of communication			1
" but a focus on political correctness should not distract from the wider , institutional betrayal of children by police , social services and local politicians			1
the scale of which was staggering and the neglect sometimes willful			0
professor @entity9 states that " nobody could say ' we did n't know ' " the crimes were committed in the open			0
the report explained how the grooming of victims ( from all racial backgrounds ) occurred : " schools raised the alert over the years about children as young as 11 , 12 and 13 being picked up outside schools by cars and taxis , given presents and mobile phones and taken to meet large numbers of unknown males in @entity6 , other local towns and cities , and further afield			1
" the girls often believed their rapists were boyfriends , men of relative wealth and sophistication , who gave them gifts and introduced them to others			0
these crimes were often reported			0
some police officers , according to @entity9 , treated the accusers with " contempt			1
" this was likely because they were children being held in care by the local authority , meaning that they were separated from their parents and typically living in homes provided by the taxpayers			2
their claims were either disbelieved or the encounters possibly dismissed as typical behavior for someone of their social status			2
on one occasion , a police officer said that a 12 - year - old having sex with five adults should n't be categorized as sexual abuse because it was " 100 % consensual in every incident " ( this advice was overruled )			1
i do n't need to spell out that @entity7 law sees things very differently			1
when crimes were reported , cases were gathered and reports filed to the council 's staff and elected officials			0
the scale was such that they were often greeted with disbelief			0
three summaries were written in total by justice officials			2
all three were largely ignored by the police and the council			2
when the scandal first went public in 2010 , the leader of @entity6 's children 's services resigned			1
just two years later , the opposition @entity142 endorsed him for its candidate to be elected @entity144 for @entity145			0
the leader of the party , @entity148 , posed with him in an election photo			0
he won the election and there are now demands -- including from @entity142 -- for him to resign			0
thus far , he has refused			0
it 's impossible to make sense of this story			0
the barbarity is so enormous , so terrible			0
there is also the frightening possibility that those responsible for failing to defend the children will not see justice			1
the report does not name names and it 's likely that the social workers and council staff who were so obviously negligent have moved on to jobs in other areas , spreading their incompetence across the country			1
while some observers wish to pin the problem on political correctness and others on under - funding , a more simple truth emerges			0
individuals did not do their jobs			0
in some cases they looked the other way			0
and it 's just possible that they will get away with it			0
they are shielded by political self - delusion			0
@entity6 council announced the report 's findings with the following assertion : " services to protect young people at risk from child sexual exploitation in @entity6 are stronger and better co-ordinated across agencies today than ever before , an independent review has found			1
" this is a stretch , to say the least			0
professor @entity9 did indicate that services have improved at the council but added that it remains understaffed and the long - term victim support inadequate			2
importantly , criminal convictions are still woefully low -- a continuing failure by the police			2
@entity7 has a number of problems to face up to			1
one is a hidden history of child abuse , most dramatically brought to light by the revelations that the late children 's entertainer and radio host @entity213 ( a friend to the rich and powerful ) used his position to exploit the vulnerable			1
another problem is that our public services can operate poorly and by their own standards			2
our welfare state is generous and -- including in @entity6 -- boasts excellent staffs doing fantastic work			0
but it also employs , even provides cover for , individuals who are negligent			0
a full public inquiry must be held into what happened in @entity6 , a scandal that repeats much of what has also happened in @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 and which is almost certainly taking place today			0
that is the only effective way to expose those responsible , and to shed light on the dickensian nightmare playing out in modern @entity7 .			1
