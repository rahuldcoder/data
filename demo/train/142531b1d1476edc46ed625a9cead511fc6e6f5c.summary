if it 's too easy , then it 's not real exploration			1
so says @entity5 , a @entity6 who in 1974 began leading expeditions into what was then one of the world 's most isolated countries -- @entity13			1
" it was a time when @entity13 had very few friends , so we decided to step in and help with what we could put together ; funding and expertise , " says @entity5 , founder of the @entity14			1
in those early days @entity13 was only just opening up			1
it was the tail end of the @entity22 and there were a lot of restrictions			0
bureaucracy and disappointment were the order of the day			0
@entity5 does n't like to recount the red tape he faced because " it 's like living through the pain			1
" a number of times when he returned to @entity34 , where he was living at the time , he considered switching his expeditions to another part of the world			0
but @entity13 always drew him back			1
remote regions open up today it 's a very different place			1
@entity42 development has n't just boosted the economy -- it 's opened up vast swathes of the country			2
in 1985 , when @entity5 led an expedition to find the source of the @entity49 , he says he and his team traveled for nine days on horseback			1
they faced not only the challenge of high altitude , but snow , rain and hail			0
he returned 10 years later to find the same journey took just five days			0
another decade saw times reduced even further			0
" when i did it in 2005 , it took just three days because the road was much closer			0
now we could probably drive all the way to the source , " says @entity5 , who began leading expeditions for @entity64 before setting up @entity14			2
expeditions into western @entity13 once involved huge amounts of off - roading , but today large mining companies are on the ground and the region is crisscrossed with roads			2
" now if we get stuck , we ask for help from the miners , " says @entity5			2
though easy access is opening up once very remote regions , the traditional way of life is disappearing			2
in 1985 @entity5 says he discovered a small community that trained otters to help them fish			2
twenty years later just one family still used this technique			0
" before there was this wide open field to explore , " says the 65 - year - old former journalist			2
" when you have roads going in left and right , if you have to look really hard to explore , then maybe it 's not where i want to be			0
" the next frontier today @entity5 has to look harder to find truly out of the way places he deems worthy of exploration			1
he says the best remaining sites are on @entity13 's frontiers			1
@entity13 shares land borders with 14 countries -- @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			1
the often complex cultural and historical backgrounds of frontiers can make them especially interesting , but timing is everything when it comes to the exploring border regions			0
as its relationships with its neighbors are sometimes volatile , countries fall in and out of favor			0
" you always have to look at timing			0
what was n't possible suddenly may become possible , " says @entity5			2
during a visit two years ago to @entity13 's border with @entity104 , @entity5 said political unrest made exploration problematic			1
on the @entity107 border , it 's currently a different story			0
@entity13 and @entity107 's political and trade ties are better than they 've been for many years , opening it up to exploration			1
@entity5 's top frontier pick is @entity13 's northeastern border with @entity102			1
while the @entity139 might draw the crowds , he says this is the place to be in winter			0
here , the @entity142 freezes so solidly that it 's possible to drive over it in a four - wheel drive vehicle			0
@entity5 went there recently to catch up with some reindeer herder friends			2
" you can drive almost to the source of the @entity142 , the 10th longest river in the world , and see the border troops talking to each other , people ice fishing and crossing the river even through they 're not supposed to , " says @entity5			1
the @entity13 border with @entity105 , near the @entity158 , is another region ripe for exploration , particularly for those interested in hill tribes			1
" it 's fascinating to look at the dynamics between people at borders , " says @entity5			1
" a lot of the time the locals are closer to the people across the border than they are to their respective governments , which are far away			0
" @entity5 says the border between @entity13 's southwestern @entity175 province and @entity106 is also ripe for exploration , as it is free from the political complications of more sensitive areas close to @entity180 or @entity104			1
still , @entity5 ca n't resist a challenge			2
he recently set off on a month - long expedition to western @entity180 -- a trip made easier by a new road , but complicated by red tape			0
new visa regulations made it impossible for @entity188 members of the team to join			0
as always , he is prepared for further trouble and has several backup plans up his sleeve			0
" exploration has to involve some logistics , some difficulty			0
if you 're like a sprint runner , ' oh , i got there first and i 'm home already and on the computer sharing it on @entity202 , ' then i do n't call it exploration , " says @entity5 .			1

journalist @entity5 has been exploring @entity13 's most remote areas since 1974
@entity13 shares land borders with 14 countries , which @entity5 says are the best places for exploration
" it 's fascinating to look at the dynamics between people at borders , " says @entity5
