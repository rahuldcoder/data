-- @entity1 had given up on writing as a career at the age of 26 after agents spurned his novel about a jewel heist involving aliens " on the @entity9			1
" after burning through severance checks from his layoff by @entity13 , he went back to work as a programmer in @entity16			0
ten years later , in 2009 , @entity1 decided to try writing again , but just as a hobby			2
keeping his day job at a mobile phone software company , he started posting a new book on a personal website , chapter by chapter as he wrote it			2
this time , there were no aliens and no imaginary planet			0
instead he crafted a story , set a few decades in the future , about an astronaut who mistakenly gets left for dead on @entity31 when the other members of his crew are forced to make a quick escape from the effects of a devastating sandstorm			1
this book found an audience			2
people starting following the story and it attracted scientists , including some who e-mailed @entity1 and offered suggestions to make the book 's excursions into physics , chemistry and biology true to science			1
today @entity1 's " @entity56 " is on the @entity52 hardcover fiction bestseller list and has been optioned by @entity53 for a potential movie , raising the question : how does a space nerd with no track record as a writer craft a compelling work of science fiction ? the book 's hero , a cheeky astronaut named @entity64 , possesses a self - reliance that enables him to jerry - rig @entity67 equipment in a suspenseful battle to eke out enough air , food and water to survive alone on @entity31			1
in an interview with @entity0 , @entity1 said that his lead character is " smarter and braver than i am			2
the core personality that most people noticed -- that he 's a massive smart ass -- that 's basically my personality			0
" @entity64 finds ways to heal the injury that led his fellow astronauts to abandon him , thinking he was dead ; to grow food in the " hab " module that is his home on @entity31 , to turn hydrogen and oxygen into water , to restore communication with @entity67 , and to drive his rover on the inhospitable @entity31 landscape far further than it was designed to go			1
and yet critical life - support components keep failing , mishaps keep setting him back , and he keeps concluding that he 's certainly about to die			0
there 's more than enough science and technology for the technically literate , and although he 's never worked at @entity67 , @entity1 has gotten compliments for the accuracy of his portrait of an enormous bureaucracy 's infighting as it struggles to save a man tens of millions of miles away			1
in the story , @entity64 's lonely struggle captures the attention of billions on @entity106 , even spawning a daily half - hour cable news program : " @entity0 's @entity108			0
" the book builds up the kind of narrative tension captured in the @entity113 best - picture contender " gravity , " which @entity1 liked , even though it may have stretched the science			1
( " it does n't have to be perfectly physically accurate to be entertaining			0
nobody calls out the physics problems in ' @entity118			0
' " ) yet accuracy is one of the things that gets cited in praise for @entity1 's book			1
astronaut @entity124 , former commander of the @entity125 , has said the book " has the very rare combination of a good , original story , interestingly real characters , and fascinating technical accuracy , " according to @entity131 , the book 's publisher			1
now 41 , @entity1 is the son of a particle physicist -- his father double - checked much of the science in " @entity56 " -- and an engineer			1
he got hooked on @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and other classic science fiction writers by plucking their paperbacks from his father 's shelf			1
predictably , @entity1 is fascinated by manned spaceflight and intrigued by the idea of a manned mission to @entity31			1
but he 's no fan of @entity149 , the nonprofit that has gotten 200,000 people to express interest in being selected for a one - way trip to @entity31 , to take place in 2025			2
@entity1 thinks the budget envisioned for the project is far too small and , " it would be basically a death sentence for the people who are going			0
" he thinks a government - funded mission to @entity31 is far more likely but not for a long time			2
the after - effects suffered by astronauts on the @entity125 show the dangers of long - term space flight , he says			0
" there are a lot of pieces of the puzzle that we need to invent " to make for safe travel to @entity31			0
near term , he looks forward to a @entity173 manned mission to the moon			0
as for @entity67 , @entity1 says he 's " disappointed by the state of our manned spaceflight program , " especially the lack of a vehicle to replace the space shuttle			1
would @entity1 want to fly on a space mission ? " i am not a brave man ... i do not have the right stuff			0
astronauts are really a cut above			0
" as a computer programmer , the closest @entity1 got to fame was as a member of the team that worked on the hit game " @entity191			2
" at his current job in @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity1 's bosses know the score , he says			1
" i 'm working on a pitch for my next novel right now , and if i get an advance , i 'm going to quit and be a full time writer , which is the culmination of my dream coming true			0
i think i have to go sit in a coffee shop when i do that			0

@entity1 finds it hard to break into science fiction , and works as a programmer instead
he posted his book a chapter at a time ; it finds audience , including scientists
" @entity56 , " now a bestseller and optioned for a film , tells of an astronaut *stranded* on @entity31
@entity1 's book has gotten praise for technical accuracy and portrait of @entity67 bureaucracy
