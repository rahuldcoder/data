@entity0 -- the state dinner is @entity0 's top fete			2
and over the years , the @entity5 administration has weathered the party crashing @entity7 â € ” an incident which launched congressional scrutiny of @entity11 security -- and a dinner - canceling snub from the @entity14 president last year after learning the @entity15 was spying on her government			1
this @entity11 has preferred to pare the pageantry in favor of quieter dinners with other world leaders			1
after all , state affairs , like the one set for tuesday night for @entity23 president @entity22 , are glitzy and require huge guest lists and stodgier protocols			2
in fact , the @entity27 have hosted just six state dinners , which is about the same number as @entity31			1
@entity32 and @entity33 threw more than 20 , and @entity34 hosted 35			0
nonetheless , the state dinner , a tradition formalized under @entity37 , is still a highly coveted social soiree			1
here 's the scoop : getting the details right : the @entity11 social secretaries , @entity43 chief of protocol , first lady 's office and others all work together to ensure that everything from culturally appropriate menus are prepared and customs honored			1
during the @entity5 's first state dinner for @entity54 prime minister @entity53 guests ate red lentil soup with fresh cheese and a choice of entrees -- roasted potato dumplings with tomato chutney , chick peas and okra for vegetarians , or green curry prawns , among other items			2
tables were adorned with magnolia branches -- from species native to both @entity54 and the @entity15			0
of course , this is also the party that @entity70 and @entity71 managed to attend without an invitation , so sometimes details slip through the cracks			0
the attire : state dinners are black tie affairs complete with tuxedos and designer gowns			1
@entity81 - based designer @entity80 created a one of a kind strapless gold and silver gown which first lady @entity5 donned during the administration 's first state dinner			2
for her first state dinner former first lady @entity87 wore " wore a @entity91 - style gown of pale yellow silk organza touched with brilliants , " according to the @entity89			2
not all of the attendees are fans of formal attire			0
@entity97 , then - leader of the @entity98 , famously refused to wear tie and tails to the state dinner thrown in his honor by president @entity103			2
" my husband would just as soon dress that way , too , if i 'd let him , " @entity104 reportedly said			0
the setting : well , the @entity108 at the @entity11 , of course			1
tables are adorned with fine linen , china from presidencies past are often used , and the room is lit by gilded candelabras and chandeliers			0
often , as in tonight 's fete , dinners are hosted in a large white tent on the @entity120 of the @entity11			1
the event is sort of the wonk world 's red carpet event and guests stream past a sea of cameras			0
the movie , " @entity129 , " a loosely factual account of the life @entity132 , a butler at the @entity11 for 34 years and through eight administrations , shows @entity132 and his wife attending a state dinner hosted by the @entity136 for west @entity138 chancellor @entity137			1
scoring an invite : if you have to ask , you 're probably not on the list			0
the list is culled from recommendations from the president and first lady , top government officials , the @entity147 , members of @entity149 , the @entity150 , and the @entity43			0
@entity152 stars and community and business leaders are also often asked to attend			0
according to the @entity11 website on state dinners , " behind the festive exterior of the social scene , the important business of government goes on -- information is gathered -- opinions exchanged -- powerful connections made and appearances upheld			1
for these reasons @entity11 invitations are the most important and the most sought after in the nation 's social whirl			1
" a seat at the table : in the 1960s , mrs. @entity87 dispensed with the long banquet tables of her predecessors in favor of round tables designed to give all guests an equal opportunity to rub elbows			1
it is a tradition that subsequent administrations have kept			0
the music : during the @entity5 administration state dinner guests have enjoyed music from such artists as @entity185 © , @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity190 folk - rockers @entity188			0
on tuesday night , @entity191 will entertain .			0
