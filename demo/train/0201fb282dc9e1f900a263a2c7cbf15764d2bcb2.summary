-- @entity1 is two victories away from becoming the first local male player to win the @entity4 in 30 years after he dismantled @entity5 in a stunning 7 - 5 6 - 3 6 - 3 victory in tuesday 's quarterfinal			1
the 28 - year - old must now beat @entity10 fourth seed @entity9 , who saw off compatriot @entity11 in a 6 - 2 6 - 1 6 - 1 win , in the semifinal if he is to replicate @entity15 's 1983 triumph			1
only one @entity16 has reached the men 's singles finals at @entity4 since , with @entity18 beaten by @entity19 of @entity20 in 1988			1
sixth seed tsonga was in irresistible form on tuesday as he atoned for the intense disappointment of his quarterfinal exit against @entity25 last year , when he lost despite creating four match points			1
" it 's extraordinary to be here and to have won , " he said			0
" i could not have dreamed it any better			0
i played superbly and i beat a champion who has won everything			2
" when @entity5 took an early break in the first set , it seemed as though the @entity35 would be coasting to yet another grand slam semifinal but the 28 - year - old @entity16 rallied in superb form			1
the first @entity16 into the last four since @entity38 five years ago , @entity1 has reached his first semifinal at @entity4 without dropping a set			1
meanwhile , 31 - year - old @entity5 -- who was bidding for an 18th grand slam title -- struggled to find any rhythm on a surface where he has never convinced			2
the defeat means the former world number one has failed to reach the semifinals of a grand slam for only the fifth time since 2004			2
only one of his 17 grand slams has come in @entity52 , with the @entity35 having won the @entity53 four times , the @entity55 on five occasions and @entity57 in seven different years			0
in a performance littered with 34 unforced errors , the demise of 2009 champions @entity5 came in just one hour and 51 minutes to the delight of those watching courtside at the @entity65 stadium			2
" i thought he played great today , " @entity5 said			2
" he was , in all areas , better than me today			0
that 's why the result was pretty clean			0
" i was impressed by the way he played today			0
i think i struggled a little bit everywhere			0
to be honest , personally , i 'm pretty sad about the match and the way i played			0
" @entity1 -- who lost his only grand slam final to @entity25 at the @entity77 -- has triumphed in only one of his three meetings against @entity9 , when defeating the @entity80 at @entity57 in 2011			1
@entity9 made light work of beating @entity11 as he reached the semifinals at @entity4 for the second year in succession , the key difference being that -- like @entity1 -- he has not dropped a set this time around			1
on wednesday , the lineup for the second semifinal will be known when world no. 1 @entity25 takes on @entity88 while @entity89 will try to continue his domination of @entity52 when facing @entity35 's @entity91 .			0

@entity1 beats @entity5 in *straight* sets to reach @entity4 semifinals
