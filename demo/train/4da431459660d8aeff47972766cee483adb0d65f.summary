-- @entity2 manager @entity1 said last week his @entity3 were title contenders in the @entity5			1
with the amount of money @entity2 continues to spend on players , many would say he was stating the obvious			2
and while @entity2 did n't play a fellow title contender monday in its season opener , the club 's display would have done little to alter @entity1 's view			1
buoyed by new signings @entity16 and @entity17 , @entity2 quickly overturned a 1 - 0 deficit to beat @entity18 3 - 1 on the road at @entity20			1
@entity17 , @entity21 and @entity22 scored for @entity2			1
" i think overall , ( we had ) very good control of the game and some moments in the quality and style we want to play , " @entity1 told @entity23			0
@entity18 's manager @entity30 suggested his newly promoted side could n't match the budget of some teams in the @entity34			2
@entity2 , though , was n't taking the @entity18 lightly -- they upset @entity35 at home early into the 2009/2010 campaign and earned another stay in the top flight last april thanks partly to a stingy defense			1
" we dropped too many points away from home last year to the lesser sides , " @entity2 defender @entity41 told @entity23			2
" we had to come here and fight and want it more than them and i think we had that			0
but more in abundance we had plenty of possession and quality play			0
" @entity1 has never been shy to tinker with his lineup , and in the off - season out went @entity2 greats @entity56 and @entity57			1
another stalwart , @entity58 , was the backup to @entity59 -- who returned from his loan spell at @entity61 -- on monday			1
but @entity41 , dubbed ' mr. @entity2 , ' completed the 90 minutes for @entity2 in the heart of the defense and he was joined on the pitch by much loved striker @entity66 when the latter came on with less than 10 minutes remaining			0
fabregas moved to @entity2 following a mostly unfruitful stint at @entity72 , and having previously played for @entity73 , his adjustment to the pace of the @entity5 was seamless			1
he played a role in all three @entity2 goals			2
" he really was the maestro , " said @entity1			0
" he controlled the tempo of the game			0
he was the man that dictated the speed , intensity and direction of the game			0
" @entity16 engineered the pass of the evening when he set up @entity85 @entity84 hero @entity21 in the 21st minute to give @entity2 a 2 - 1 advantage			1
only seven minutes earlier , @entity88 's thumping finish handed @entity18 a dream start			0
@entity17 proved in @entity90 that he was one of the best finishers around , and he did n't miss from close range in the 17th minute after the ball had come off the post			0
@entity16 ' fellow @entity96 international is being counted on to score in abundance in the wake of @entity2 's strikers struggling last term			2
@entity17 , though , received a yellow card for diving , despite replays showing he was clipped by goalkeeper @entity104			0
" his play , movement and interaction with @entity108 ( @entity109 ) and @entity21 and @entity110 was very , very good , " said @entity1			0
" i feel very sorry for him because it was a penalty and never a yellow card			0
" @entity22 , a defender , converted from a @entity16 corner in the 34th minute as @entity2 became the only team in the first round of fixtures to find the net three times			1
@entity2 eased up in the second half and @entity18 elevated its game -- @entity59 pulled off a great save to deny @entity88 a second in the 49th minute			1
but @entity2 cruised to three points to match @entity123 , the defending champion and @entity1 's major rival this season .			2

@entity2 beats @entity18 3 - 1 in the teams ' opening game of the @entity5 season
@entity17 , @entity21 and @entity22 scored the goals for @entity2
@entity16 impresses for @entity2 in his first *competive* game for the @entity3
@entity59 started in goal for @entity2 *ahead* of club great @entity58
