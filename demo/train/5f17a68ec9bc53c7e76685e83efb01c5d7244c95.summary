-- a year to the day after winning @entity3 's first championship in nearly half a century , coach @entity1 was sacked as the club 's ambitious @entity5 owners finally lost patience with the @entity8			1
the 48 - year - old @entity1 's dismissal follows @entity3 's shock @entity12 defeat by @entity13 on saturday and their inability to defend the @entity16 title the club won last season , with rivals @entity19 running away with the league this season			1
" despite everyone 's best efforts , the club has failed to achieve any of its stated targets this year , with the exception of qualification for next season 's @entity29 , " said a @entity3 statement			1
" this , combined with an identified need to develop a holistic approach to all aspects of football at the club , has meant that the decision has been taken to find a new manager for the 2013/14 season and beyond			0
" sheikh @entity39 completed a reported $ 300 million takeover in 2008 and has spent millions more in making @entity3 , who will finish second this season , into a major force in the @entity16			2
after buying @entity3 , @entity39 invested more than $ 600 million on players like @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , and helped the perennial underachievers beat neighbors @entity19 to the title on goal difference last season			2
@entity1 's dismissal comes a year to the day since @entity3 beat @entity53 to win its first top - flight title in 44 years and nearly two years to the day since he won the club 's first trophy in 35 years , when beating @entity57 in the @entity59 final			1
yet the club did not make it out of their @entity29 group this season , becoming the first @entity65 side to fail to win any of its six matches during the group phase of the competition			0
the buildup to the @entity12 had been overshadowed with widespread rumors that @entity1 , who signed a five year deal last july , would be replaced by former @entity74 coach @entity73 , who guided @entity75 to this year 's @entity29 quarterfinals			2
" this has been a difficult decision for the owner , chairman and board to make and it is the outcome of a planned end of season review process that has been brought forward in light of recent speculation and out of respect for @entity1 and his extensive contributions to the football club , " added the @entity3 statement			1
on sunday night , @entity73 told @entity75 's website that he had not lined up any move to become @entity3 's next coach			0
" i categorically deny i am the new @entity3 coach , nothing has been signed and no agreement reached , " said the @entity92			0
" i 've been fortunate enough , and am very proud , that every year the big clubs are interested in me			0
i have an agreement with @entity75 not to talk to anyone and nothing has been agreed with any other outfit			0
" @entity3 's assistant manager @entity101 has been placed in charge for the remaining two games of the season and the club 's post-season tour to the @entity107 before a permanent manager is appointed			1
" @entity1 's record speaks for itself and he has the respect and gratitude of @entity39 , myself and the @entity113 for all of his hard work and commitment over the last three and a half years , " said chairman @entity109 in the @entity3 statement			2
" he has clearly also secured the love and respect of our fans			0
he has done as he promised and delivered silverware and success , breaking the club 's 35 - year trophy drought and securing the title in 2012			1
" i would like to personally and publicly thank him for his dedication to the progress that he has overseen and for his support and continued friendship			0
" @entity3 's sacking of @entity1 came on the day @entity19 held a victory parade to mark their 20th league title and sir @entity134 's retirement , an event that drew thousands of fans on to the streets of the @entity65 north west city			1
@entity1 leaves with the fourth highest win percentage of any manager in the @entity16 , a record bettered only by former @entity143 coaches @entity144 and @entity145 , as well as @entity134 himself			0
the trophies aside , @entity1 's time at @entity3 is likely to be remembered for several rows with star players , most notably @entity47 and @entity150 , and for engineering @entity19 's worst home defeat in 56 years as @entity3 won 6 - 1 at @entity152 , the first time the @entity153 had conceded six goals at home since 1930			2
a former coach of @entity157 , @entity1 was appointed in december 2009 after the club sacked @entity159 and was afforded millions to spend in the transfer market by the club 's oil - rich owners			1
last august , the @entity164 club appointed former @entity166 board member @entity165 as their new chief executive , while in october @entity168 appointed former @entity166 technical director @entity169 as their director of football .			0
