@entity1 , @entity0 -- there are some circuits that are cornerstones of the @entity6 calendar : the @entity10 and @entity11 whose every twist and turn are known intimately by the drivers and engineers			2
then there are the newer circuits -- @entity18 and @entity19 , for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins			2
@entity23 employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view			1
next week they have something completely new to contend with : a track that has yet to see a single @entity31 team put in a single lap. @entity33 is to return to the @entity23 , a circuit that has n't seen an @entity31 race since 1977 ( though now with a substantially different track layout )			1
the @entity23 circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games			1
the old @entity23 was the setting for the 1982 arcade game @entity41 ( released by @entity43 in @entity44 and @entity45 in the rest of the world )			1
the most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of @entity23 , @entity44 's tallest mountain , looming in the distance			1
though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies			0
the @entity56 track -- which had held @entity44 @entity57 between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike , but for this year and the next the @entity44 @entity33 will be held at @entity23			1
however an announcement by @entity61 ( @entity61 ) this month revealed that @entity56 will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the @entity44 @entity33 alternating yearly between @entity23 and @entity56 after that			1
behind the scenes is a political battleground -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with @entity6 connections -- @entity73 owns @entity56 , @entity31 owns @entity23			1
@entity31 is a relative newcomer to @entity6 but , having this year surpassed @entity76 as the world 's number one automobile manufacturer , and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock ( a position that has n't been reflected in sporting success ) , it is not without clout			0
the redesign of the @entity23 track was carried out by @entity86 in 2003			1
@entity86 , a @entity88 architect redesigned a number of @entity31 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including @entity18 , @entity92 , @entity19 and @entity93 , and the tracks for 2008 's debut grands prix in @entity97 and @entity98			0
so how do @entity31 teams prepare for a new circuit such as @entity23 without data from previous races to fall back on ? the answer lies with computer simulation			1
computer - aided design ( @entity106 ) is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high - tech cars			1
every bend , every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself			0
despite never having raced on the circuit , the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual @entity23 for some time			1
@entity124 's simulation experts received @entity106 data from the @entity44 race organizers late last year			1
and when their cars arrive at @entity23 for testing next week , their race set - up should be close to optimum			2
the circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments			2
the radius of each individual segment was measured , allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line ( the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance )			2
then the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated			0
the slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car			0
" in order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend , we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels , gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance , " says @entity151 , technical director of the @entity124			0
@entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 with @entity31 explains : " you start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit			2
once you know that , you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce , before you get into more detailed simulations of different set - up solutions			0
" getting a bit closer to the weekend , you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy			0
this prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track , like the degradation of the two @entity185 tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time			0
if you have more fuel in the car , this affects your lap time , but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried			0
" one peculiarity of the @entity23 circuit is the exceptionally long main straight , which at 1.475 km ( 0.916 miles ) will allow for higher - than average - straight line speeds but , after the straight the track is relatively twisty			1
the teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight , and the best grip decelerating into the bends			2
" you have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip , " says @entity161 , " and as always you want good grip in general , but you have to balance that with the long straight , where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed			0
" the testing may be virtual , but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair 's breadth away from real world eventualities : " our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values , " says @entity151			2
not that everything can be predicted : " i think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race , " continues @entity161			0
" many incidents can happen , which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy			0
