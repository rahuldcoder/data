@entity0 never thought this day would come			1
the artist says that when she spoke out three weeks ago , in a @entity3 opinion article , she hoped to give voice to other women who claimed to have been sexually assaulted by legendary comedian @entity6			1
she says she wanted them to know they were not alone			0
since then , at least 16 others have gone public with accusations			0
many of them offered similar stories about being drugged and raped , and said they were reluctant to talk earlier because they feared for their careers , their families or their own safety			0
three of @entity6 's accusers , including @entity19 , told @entity20 on tuesday of having struggled and gained strength in solidarity			1
" one of my main goals was to reach out to these women who did n't have the courage yet , " said @entity19			1
" seeing it in action is really intense			0
" while @entity6 has not commented on the allegations , his camp has repeatedly and vigorously denied them			1
in a recent statement , @entity6 's lawyer @entity32 said it defies common sense that " so many people would have said nothing , done nothing , and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years			1
" @entity43 was a @entity45 bunny when , she claims , @entity6 drugged and raped her in the late 1960s			1
she called such denials " absolutely ridiculous , " adding , " he 's got a very good spin doctor			2
" asked why it took her and others so long to come forward , @entity49 said that " over the years , women did n't have a voice			1
" " rape victims , sexual assault victims were victimized by the system , " she told @entity20 's ' @entity55			1
' " ... we did n't believe in the system , because the system did not stand by us through things like this			2
" rape allegations wo n't go away for @entity6 comedian draws attention to @entity6 accusations in the pantheon of @entity71 's greatest comedians , they do n't get much bigger than @entity6			1
he broke though in the 1960s on the stand - up circuit with his reflections on everything growing up in @entity76 to family life with his children and wife @entity79			0
his comedy albums became bestsellers and award - winners ; he spearheaded numerous shows , from children 's programming like " @entity86 " and @entity88 's current " @entity87 " to his groundbreaking sitcom , " @entity90			0
" @entity6 also became a well - known and respected voice on a host of hot - button issues			1
" @entity6 is a gifted comedian who has used the power of laughter to heal wounds and to build bridges , " then - president @entity94 said in awarding @entity6 a @entity95 in 2002			2
" ... by focusing on our common humanity , @entity6 is helping to create a truly united @entity71			2
" yet @entity6 's reputation has come crashing down in a few short weeks			1
@entity6 resigns from @entity105 board it began in late october , when comedian @entity107 bluntly attacked what he perceived as @entity6 's " smuggest old black man public persona " and called him a " rapist			1
" @entity19 said tuesday that it " felt like a slap in the face " that it took a comedian 's comments on stage " for people to perk up their ears and think , ' oh , maybe there is something to this , ' when it 's such a serious situation			0
" by that point , years had passed since @entity105 staffer @entity126 had sued @entity6 alleging she had been drugged and sexually violated in 2004 and that 13 other " @entity128 " had similar stories			2
@entity19 wrote in the @entity3 that she was one of those women , but she never got the chance to testify because the lawsuit was settled			0
had she gotten the chance , @entity19 would have recalled her life as an aspiring model and actress in her late teens back in the mid- 1980s , back when @entity6 starred in his eponymous no. 1 tv show as a doting , wisecracking dad			2
that was when , she claims , @entity6 drugged and raped her , then told her , " ' i had better never , ever see your face or hear you name again			1
' " after @entity107 ' remarks she decided to put herself out there			0
" it was really , really scary			0
i really felt like i was out in the wilderness , all by myself , " @entity19 told @entity20			2
" and one of the things that i kept saying over and over again was , ' if i could help one woman , just one , then i 've done my job ... but i had no idea how powerful it was really going to be for these women and other women who are still off the record			0
" ' i thought i was the only one ' @entity49 said she had thought of coming forward before herself , but stopped because " i could n't relive it , i could n't do it			1
" but " it was a whole different ballgame " after @entity19 took that first step , @entity49 said			2
in the age of the @entity164 , she said , accusations could n't easily " be swept away into the shadows any more			0
" also on the @entity20 set tuesday was @entity168			2
" for years , i thought that i was the only one , " said @entity168 , who claims @entity6 sexually assaulted her in the late 1980s , when she was a model and aspiring actress			1
" i kept this as a secret ... afraid no one is going to believe you , afraid society is going to victimize you			0
" @entity168 said that , because she 's @entity176 , she was especially reluctant to speak out , as @entity6 has long been revered in that community			1
about a decade ago , @entity168 said , a friend alleged to her that @entity6 had done something similar to her , but @entity168 urged her " to keep quiet			1
" " and i feel guilty , i feel horrible , " @entity168 said			0
" you 're raised to , ' shhh , do n't talk			0
' " now is different , though			0
meeting face - to - face with @entity19 and @entity49 is part of her " healing process , " she said			2
" it was n't about him , it was about what was best for me , " added @entity168			0
" ... when you tell the truth , it really does set you free			0
i never understood what that meant until now			0
