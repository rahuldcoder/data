@entity0 -- @entity3 veteran @entity2 has an impressive rolodex , deep policy expertise , and an invaluable background as a political strategist and @entity0 fixer -- all things that could benefit president @entity10 as he assumes a top - level advisory role			1
@entity2 , who served as former president @entity13 's chief of staff during the last tumultuous three years of his presidency , announced via @entity15 that he is joining the @entity3 during a critical time in the @entity10 's tenure			1
he plans to stay for a year as presidential counselor			0
@entity10 faces record low approval ratings as he winds up the first year of his second term			0
the disastrous roll out of the @entity29 , his signature domestic achievement , an economy still not working for millions of @entity31 , fallout over @entity23 spying , and criticism of his diplomatic responses to @entity26 and @entity27 , have all weighed him down with the public			0
' peripheral vision ' @entity2 's hire , which has been confirmed by @entity1 but not yet announced by the @entity3 , is seen as a politically necessary step for a @entity3 back on its heels and at times criticized as inexperienced			2
@entity38 , who has seen -- and managed -- the inner workings of an administration as a @entity42 member and a @entity3 chief of staff , said @entity10 is making a good decision by allowing fresh perspective into his inner circle of close - knit advisers , although he said it should have happened earlier			1
" it 's important for the president to allow peripheral vision in so you do n't get stuck with the same old tunnel vision , " @entity38 told @entity1 , cautioning that it 's easy for presidents and their staff to become trapped by their own ideology and emotional attachment to issues and policy			1
should @entity10 get credit for the economy ? @entity38 left the @entity63 @entity3 after 5Â½ years			1
he said most reelected presidents have faced similar obstacles at about the same point in their second terms			0
@entity68 got bogged down by the @entity69 , @entity13 faced impeachment over the @entity72 affair and @entity63 suffered backlash over @entity74 and the ongoing @entity75			1
" i ca n't think of a sitting president ... that did n't have these challenges and did n't address it the same way , " @entity38 said			2
he said he used to tell @entity63 that policy changes can not be the only way to fix a problem facing the administration			0
" i would remind the president that if you address a policy concern but you have n't changed personalities , the public does n't see it , " @entity38 said			2
because the media is talking about @entity2 's arrival signals that this change might be significant enough to actually make a difference , he noted			2
liberal left @entity95 , former communications director for @entity97 majority leader @entity96 , said @entity2 will help @entity10 overcome some hurdles			1
" it 's a step toward getting the administration back on its feet again , " he said			0
after his three - year stint as @entity13 's top aide , @entity2 built the think tank @entity103 , which became a powerhouse of liberal thought and communications			1
and just weeks ago , he launched the @entity108 for @entity109 to focus on income inequality , which was around the same time @entity10 began talking about the issue from the bully pulpit			2
" @entity2 's one of the great progressive strategists of his generation , " @entity113 , former @entity10 communications adviser , said			1
" having him at the @entity3 is a great thing for folks who really care about some of the key fights for folks on the left			0
" @entity2 , who led the president 's transition team in 2008 , has also been a leading advocate of policies to address climate change , an @entity10 policy priority that has gone nowhere during his time in office			1
link to @entity130 @entity2 has the expertise to take the climate change issue and income inequality into greater prominence during the next year as he is thought to have good relationships with members of @entity130			0
" there are probably some people on @entity139 who are saying , ' oh , finally , ' " @entity38 said			0
@entity97 @entity140 still angry over filibuster change but @entity95 said a better working relationship with a sharply partisan @entity130 could be a heavy lift , even for the politically astute @entity2 , and especially as the president enters his lame duck years			2
there 's always executive action			0
and that 's a tool at @entity10 's disposal with which @entity2 has familiarity			1
he worked with @entity13 during his lame duck years when republicans in @entity130 were trying to force him out of office			0
@entity154 , @entity1 senior political analyst and @entity156 editorial director , said @entity2 will help @entity10 work his will " through the levers of the executive branch " where he is " more likely to make a mark " in the final years			1
whether it 's fixing problems or promoting new priorities , @entity2 is widely respected in @entity0 and might have the gravitas to right the president 's ship			2
" they 've got a lot of work to do , " @entity95 said			0
