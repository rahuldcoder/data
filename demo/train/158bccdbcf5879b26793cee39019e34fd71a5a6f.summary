-- the @entity2 would no longer deny membership to youth on the basis of sexual orientation but would maintain its ban on openly gay adult leaders under a proposal it is considering , the group said friday			1
the organization 's executive committee made the proposal , which is expected to be presented to the @entity2 ' voting members at its may meeting in @entity16			1
if the policy is approved , it will take effect january 1			1
" if approved , the resolution would mean that ' no youth may be denied membership in the @entity2 on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone			1
' the @entity2 will maintain the current membership policy for all adults , " @entity2 public relations director @entity25 said			1
survey asks whether gay and straight boy scouts can share tent the @entity2 have been considering a change in the longstanding policy against allowing openly gay members			1
in february , the @entity2 ' national executive board postponed a vote on lifting its outright ban on openly gay scouts and troop leaders and ordered a survey of its members on the issue			1
the survey showed a generational split between adults and youth in the scouting community			0
while most adults support the @entity2 ' current policy of " excluding open and avowed homosexuals , young parents and teens tend to oppose the policy , " according to the survey , which was also released friday			2
the change does n't go far enough for @entity55 , an @entity56 and former assistant troop leader who sued the scouts under @entity60 state law after he was kicked out of the @entity2 in 1990 because he is gay			1
" this proposal continues to send a destructive message , offering the veneer of acceptance while still communicating that being gay is immoral , " @entity55 said			2
" fair - minded @entity66 will not again welcome the @entity2 until they stop discriminating			0
" @entity55 : boy scouts need to stop discriminating @entity55 's lawsuit , filed in 1992 , said his expulsion violated the state 's anti-discrimination law			0
when his case made it to the @entity75 in 2000 , the court ruled that it would violate the @entity2 ' @entity77 protection of freedom of association to require that it accept gay members			1
lawyer @entity80 , who represented @entity55 in that case , applauded the move to include gay youth in scouting but agreed that banning them once they 're adults is wrong			0
" barring discrimination against gay youth is an important step forward that is in the best interest of young people and scouting in @entity66 , " @entity80 said			0
" but leaving in place a discriminatory policy once those kids grow up still sends a damaging message to gay and non-gay young people that is inconsistent with the other values that scouting claims to teach			0
" former @entity102 , founder of @entity103 , a group opposing the policy change , said the @entity2 currently allow anyone to participate , disallowing only " the open and aggressive promotion of homosexuality and political agendas , " according to a statement			2
" when it comes to young boys , parents should still have the final say on the issues of sexuality and politics , " he said			0
" allowing open homosexuality in the @entity2 injects both those topics right into the program			0
we urge the national council to vote against this resolution and uphold the time - tested membership policy of the @entity2			2
" there 's no guarantee the approximately 1,400 voting members will follow the national board 's lead in its may vote			1
the local representatives who are voting members of the national council are supposed to represent their local councils ' viewpoints			1
opinion : @entity136 on gays hurting scouting " it is up to each ( local ) council and each voting member of the @entity2 to determine how to fulfill these obligations in a manner that fulfills their responsibility to both the @entity2 and to their local council , " @entity2 spokesman @entity25 wrote in an e-mail			2
the @entity148 hopes to convince the voting members to vote " no. " the group is presenting a stand with the @entity2 simulcast on may 5 , asking people to watch together in their churches and homes			1
" the outcome of this decision will affect the very future of @entity138 , as a shift in the policy would undermine the very principles held by the @entity2 for over a century , " said the council , on its website			2
" this decision is too important for those who value the @entity2 and its value to @entity66 communities to stand idly by			0
" @entity167 , @entity168 , scout leader @entity169 sees the glass as half - full			0
" i am forever an optimist , and i see it as a very big step forward in the right direction to which i will applaud , " said @entity169 , an @entity56 and married father of four , ages 4 months to 7 years			0
saddened by recent stories of @entity56 turning in their badges , @entity169 launched @entity178 to support gay scouts and their allies and create an atmosphere that 's more welcoming			0
@entity169 's website is selling patches similar to those @entity2 earn to signal support for gay members			1
( the price tag is $ 3.50 per patch , and $ 1 goes to the @entity188			0
) " i had great , great leaders ( in the @entity2 ) ; they were like second parents to me , " he said			2
" i took their example of love and compassion and wanted to do something			0
