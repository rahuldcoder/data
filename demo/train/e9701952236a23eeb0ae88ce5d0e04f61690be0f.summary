sen. @entity0 , @entity1 , may be frustrated with the president 's anticipated executive action on immigration , but he 's not looking to shutdown the government again to stop him			1
" there is no @entity9 -- not one -- who wants a government shutdown , " @entity0 said on @entity7 wednesday			2
" the only person on this planet who wants a shutdown is president @entity16			1
" @entity0 , who voted in favor of shutting down the government last year over @entity19 , made the expected argument that the president would be violating the powers set by the @entity23 by forcing executive action			1
but the former @entity26 editor took the argument a step further wednesday , saying that if the president acted , he would be forcing voters to take a plunge			0
" i 'm sorry to say , the president is behaving in an unprecedented way , " @entity0 said			0
" there is not in recent times any parallel for a president repudiated by the voters standing up and essentially telling the voters , ' go jump in a lake '			0
he 's going to force his powers			0
" earlier wednesday , the first - term senator penned a @entity44 op - ed titled " @entity16 is not a @entity45 , " where he slammed the president for threatening executive action			1
once seen as an obstructionist -- for his 2013 government shutdown crusade -- the potential 2016 contender is changing his strategy this time around for defying the president			0
wednesday evening , @entity0 laid out a three - step plan for how the @entity9 should reign in a " despotic executive			0
" in the plan , @entity0 told @entity54 that incoming @entity56 - elect @entity55 , @entity57 , should threaten to block any nominations by the president , with the exception of those for vital national security positions			1
he also said @entity63 should use the power of the purse to pass appropriation legislation that limits the power of both the @entity63 and the president to spend money on the president 's executive action , once all other necessary government agencies and functions are funded			1
while @entity0 says legislative action is the best way to move forward to combat the president 's initiative , a few of his @entity9 colleagues -- and potential 2016 rivals -- said they felt a lawsuit would be more appropriate			2
earlier wednesday , @entity83 gov. @entity82 said there is a " very real possibility " @entity83 will sue @entity16 over his executive action			1
@entity88 gov. @entity87 agreed , saying he would also go to the courts because he thinks " there 's a pretty compelling argument			0
" the president is expected to announce his executive action plan thursday in a prime time address			2
sources familiar with the plan tell @entity98 that it includes deferring deportation for the parents of @entity102 citizens , a move that would affect up to 3.5 million people .			0
