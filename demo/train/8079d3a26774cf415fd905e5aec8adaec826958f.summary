-- the timeline for autonomous cars hitting the road en masse keeps getting closer			1
@entity7 's @entity6 division expects to produce partially autonomous cars at a large scale by 2015 , and the automaker also predicts it will have fully autonomous cars available by the end of the decade			1
@entity14 and @entity15 have also shown self - driving car concepts , with the former working with @entity17 to pilot a modified @entity18 up @entity19			0
meanwhile , @entity20 is ripping along at its own rapid pace with a fleet of fully autonomous @entity24 hybrids that have logged over 300,000 miles			0
and the company has pushed through legislation that legalizes self - driving cars in @entity28			0
@entity29 is close behind , and @entity20 has also been busy lobbying joyriding lawmakers in @entity33 but while we know that robo - cars are coming , the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) recently released predictions that autonomous cars will account for up to 75 percent of vehicles on the road by the year 2040			1
the organization went even further , forecasting how infrastructure , society and attitudes could change when self - driving cars become the norm around the middle of the century			0
@entity36 envisions an absence of traffic signs and lights since highly evolved , self - driving cars wo n't need them , and it believes that full deployment could even eliminate the need for driver 's licenses			1
@entity20 gets license to operate driverless cars in @entity28 while this all sounds sci - fi , we 're already starting to see separate threads of this autonomous - car future being weaved in current real - world tests			1
it 's been assumed that the largest hurdle for autonomous cars is building the infrastructure			1
not so , says dr. @entity67 , @entity36 senior member and professor of computer engineering at the @entity70 in @entity71			1
@entity67 , the director of a 2010 project that successfully piloted two driverless cars on an 8,000 - mile road trip from @entity75 to @entity76 , points out that two current types of self - driving cars will need less infrastructure , not more			2
" the @entity20 cars are based on very precise maps and they have sensing primarily based on a @entity83 technology , " he told @entity0			0
" the cars that we tested on the route from @entity75 to @entity76 had no maps , and had sensing primarily based on cameras			0
in both cases , the cars have no help from the infrastructure			0
" when reached for comment , a @entity20 spokesman declined to make a statement on this story and @entity36 's predictions on autonomous cars			1
but @entity67 also delineates between what he sees as different levels of self - driving technology as the features mature , and adds that infrastructure in the form of centralized communication once large numbers of autonomous cars are on the road will be crucial -- and have the greatest impact			2
this could lead to traffic lights , speed limits and even driver licensing disappearing			1
" autonomous cars alone will bring limited benefits , " he says			2
" they would be able to locate obstacles , avoid them and follow the road			0
but efficient autonomous operations would also require that vehicles coordinate with each other			2
" a nascent form of vehicle - to - vehicle communication ( @entity124 ) is currently being tested in a @entity126 field trial in @entity127 , allowing cars to share situational data to avoid crashing into each other			0
meanwhile , @entity131 is testing the concept of using " road trains " in @entity135 to allow for more efficient driving			0
" a train of vehicles moving very close to each other would reach a higher throughput -- the number of cars per road unit -- and have lower fuel consumption due to aerodynamic drift , " says @entity67			2
vehicle - to - infrastructure ( @entity146 ) communication would also allow vehicles to share their position , destination and intended route with a central station , @entity67 continues , that could coordinate and dispatch information about traffic and route vehicles accordingly			2
" suppose all cars are connected and a central station knows precisely their position and destination , " @entity67 says			0
" the central station can send speed adjustment commands to the vehicles that enter an intersection in such a way that they do not collide and they occupy the intersection area one at a time , optimizing their movements			0
in this case , traffic lights will not be required since coordination is reached at a higher level			1
" we 're already seeing a basic form of this in testing going on in @entity135 that combines @entity124 and @entity146 communication , collectively known as @entity176			0
@entity36 also foresees autonomous vehicles accelerating car sharing and helping make it more widespread , especially for people within a wider range of ages and physical abilities			1
and driverless cars may even eliminate the need for driver 's licenses			1
" people do not need a license to sit on a train or a bus , " said @entity188 , director of the @entity36 's @entity189 , in a statement			1
" in a full - autonomy case in which no driver intervention will be allowed , the car will be operating			0
so there will not be any special requirements for drivers or occupants to use the vehicle as a form of transportation			0
" @entity36 also predicts that the biggest barrier to pervasive adoption of driverless cars may have nothing to do with technology , but will be general public acceptance			1
while the average driver may grasp the basic benefits of autonomous cars -- increased fuel efficiency and safety , along with a reduction in traffic -- it may not be enough to get them to let go of the steering wheel			2
@entity220 , @entity36 member and associate professor of computer systems engineering at the @entity223 , believes that baby steps in the form of driver assist systems may help			1
" as more vehicular controls begin being automated , such as parallel parking and automatic braking , people will become more accepting of autonomous technologies , " @entity220 told @entity0			0
" so by 2040 , driverless vehicles will be widely accepted and possibly be the dominant vehicles on the road			1

@entity36 : 75 *%* of cars will be autonomous by 2040
the engineering group says traffic lights will go away
@entity250 's licenses may also become relics of the past
professor : ' by 2040 , driverless vehicles will be widely accepted '
