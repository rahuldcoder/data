-- the classic " @entity2 " episode " @entity3 " will be 15 years old in may			1
in honor of @entity5 and @entity7 's ill - fated trip to @entity8 in a mail truck full of bottles and cans they hoped to redeem for dimes , let 's take a look at why @entity8 's bottle deposit is so high			1
how long has @entity8 had the dime deposit ? the 10 - cent deposit traces its roots back to the @entity20 of 1976			1
here 's how it works : the consumer pays an additional dime up front , which will be refunded when the can or bottle is returned			2
the rule aims to curb litter , encourage recycling , and provide funding for environmental programs			2
@entity0 : why @entity33 have an @entity34 ? does the higher deposit prompt more recycling ? a five - cent difference may sound trifling , but the higher deposit helps make @entity8 's recycling program wildly successful			1
although it 's tough to track fraudulent cans and bottles that come in from outside the state , the @entity8 program has returned over 95 percent of the deposits it has taken in since the year 2000			1
according to stats published by the @entity48 , these rates dramatically outpace those in states with nickel deposits , where redemption rates largely remain in the 60 - to - 80 - percent range			0
those dimes add up , too			0
in 2008 , @entity8 returned over $ 407 million in deposits			2
@entity0 : a seinfeld guest star quiz could @entity5 and @entity7 really have pulled off their stunt ? possibly , but it would have been illegal			1
bringing in containers from other states and taking @entity8 's dimes is technically fraud			1
in 2011 , they 'd have had an additional problem , as the state now uses " reverse vending machines " to scan barcodes and make sure the container in question is eligible for redemption			0
moreover , they might have had to find quite a few stores to redeem their cans			2
under @entity8 law , retailers have to return $ 25 worth of deposits per person per day			2
retailers are allowed to return larger sums at their own discretion , but they 're only required to shell out $ 25 to each person			0
since @entity5 and @entity7 had $ 500 worth of cans apiece , they might have found themselves hoofing it to 20 different retailers			1
@entity0 : stories behind 11 regional soft drinks has anyone actually tried this scam ? oh yeah			0
in 2007 , @entity92 ran @entity93 -- no points for creative naming there -- which led to the arraignment of 10 grocers and conspirators			1
the grocers ' scam was pretty much @entity5 and @entity7 's idea on a grander scale : smugglers in @entity105 collected millions of cans and sold them to grocers at a discount off the 10 - cent redemption value			1
the grocers then redeemed the deposits for the full dime , and everyone made a profit			0
at least they did until the law caught wind of the scheme			0
in the course of making the 10 arrests , the authorities turned up millions of cans and $ 500,000 in cash			2
the director of the @entity92 told @entity125 that similar scams defraud the state of $ 13 million each year			0
what happens to any unclaimed dimes ? even though an extremely high percentage of containers are returned , unclaimed deposits still regularly add up to eight - figure sums each year			0
three quarters of that money goes into the @entity136 to pay for environmental programs , while the remainder goes to the retailers			0
