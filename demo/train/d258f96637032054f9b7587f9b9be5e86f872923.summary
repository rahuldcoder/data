an @entity2 public high school declined to enroll a 17 - year - old @entity4 student twice " simply because he was born in @entity6 , " the @entity0 said tuesday			1
the teen , identified only as " @entity9 " by the @entity0 , endured discrimination when he attempted to enroll at @entity11 in january after moving to @entity2 from @entity12 , the civil rights group said			1
@entity9 immigrated to the @entity13 from @entity6 when he was 1 , according to @entity0 staff attorney @entity14			1
the student 's family met with the district superintendent and " brought a completed enrollment application , proof of residency in the school district , an immunization record and a social security card , " but @entity9 was still denied enrollment , the @entity0 said			1
" the principal did not even look at the documents			0
after @entity9 said he had to make up two failed classes from the previous year , the principal said he could n't enroll him , " the @entity0 said			1
@entity30 superintendent @entity29 said the law forbids him giving information that could identify a student , as well a publicly responding about the " enrollment concern that has been presented to me			2
" " however , i can unequivocally confirm that the @entity36 in no manner utilizes or considers an individual 's national origin in its enrollment decisions			0
indeed , even a cursory review of the system 's current student population , confirms the enrollment of a diverse student body , " he said in a prepared statement			2
he further said , " the representative for the individual at issue has been specifically advised that he is more than welcome to immediately enroll into the system subject to the same enrollment criteria applicable to any individual such as himself that is over the age of mandatory school attendance			0
the individual has been requested to meet with the system this week in order to facilitate the enrollment request			0
" @entity58 , a spokesman for the @entity59 , told @entity60 , " we certainly tolerate no type of discrimination and need to look into it			0
" in a letter to @entity66 , the @entity0 wrote that the " practices violate federal law that bars discrimination based on national origin , immigration status or limited @entity73 proficiency			1
" the school told the family it was not obligated to enroll @entity9 because he is 17 , according a statement by the @entity0			1
" it makes me feel like i dropped out , " @entity9 said in a statement			0
" it 's like i have nothing to accomplish			2
" @entity2 state law requires children between the ages of 6 and 17 to attend school , but " it does not grant the right to deny a child enrollment simply because he or she is 17 , " the letter said			2
" this excuse has no basis in district or state education policy , " the letter said			0
" it even violates the nondiscrimination policies of the @entity59 and the district			0
" the @entity0 , a nonprofit civil rights organization based in @entity2 , has instructed the district to enroll the student by april 14			1
asked if there were other documented cases of this occurring , @entity14 said the @entity0 has heard similar reports out of @entity104 but emphasized that the group was representing only one teen			2
she further said that while the @entity0 does n't have any national figures available , the @entity13 justice and education departments issued a letter to school districts in may 2011 to ensure that no child was denied the opportunity to enroll in school or discouraged from enrolling based on origin or immigrations status			1
the guidance " was issued when many states were passing anti-immigrant legislation , including @entity2 's ( @entity120 ) , which required schools to record the immigration status of children enrolling in school , " @entity14 said in an e-mail			1
" of course , that provision of the law has been stopped by a federal court			0
but there remains concern that schools are potentially excluding children based on their national origin , immigration status , or limited @entity73 proficiency			0
" complaint claims school district discriminated against @entity4 students			0

schools superintendent denies discrimination , says student welcome to enroll
@entity0 : student not allowed to enroll because he was born in @entity6
the teen has been in the @entity13 since he was 1 and moved to @entity2 in january
" it 's like i have nothing to accomplish . i just feel worthless , " teen says
