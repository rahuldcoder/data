@entity0 -- a court in @entity3 on friday dropped the most serious charge facing @entity5 , a sister of @entity6 , raising the possibility that she could avoid a court trial in a financial scandal			1
the @entity10 in @entity11 threw out a charge of money laundering but allowed two charges of tax fraud to stand , according to the court order			1
it was not immediately clear whether the alleged crimes , as charged , would mean a trial for the princess			2
a magistrate who has been investigating the financial scandal for several years will have to determine whether to do so , an official at the court told @entity1			0
a court trial of a member of the @entity3 royal family would be unprecedented			0
the case centers on the nonprofit @entity30 foundation , which received millions of dollars in government contracts to stage sports and tourism events			0
the magistrate , judge @entity34 , investigated whether part of that money may have been diverted for private use by the princess and her husband , @entity39 , who is also charged			2
through their legal teams , both have denied any wrongdoing			0
before the three - judge panel issued its 160 - page ruling friday -- in response to appeals by various parties to the case -- the court official , by custom not identified , had told @entity1 that the princess almost certainly would have faced trial if the court had upheld all three charges against her			1
but since only the two counts of alleged tax fraud still stand , @entity34 must decide whether to apply a legal precedent in @entity3 that if the state prosecutor was n't pressing charges for tax fraud , which is the situation for the princess , then no trial would be held			1
a small union called @entity62 , or @entity63 , is alone in pressing the tax fraud charges against her , as a kind of private prosecution , permitted in @entity3			2
the @entity68 previously ruled in a separate case that a private charge alone was not strong enough to force a tax fraud trial			1
@entity73 and some 15 other defendants who are charged in the case are expected to face trial , the court official said			0
the judge has not set a trial date yet .			0

new : magistrate in the case must decide whether @entity5 will stand trial
court in @entity11 throws out a charge of money laundering
but princess @entity5 still faces two charges *relating* to alleged tax fraud
it is not clear whether the *remaining* charges are serious enough to require a trial
