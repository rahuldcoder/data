-- an app that helps users find other apps for free has been banned from @entity5 's mobile store in a move some say heralds a new round of blacklisting for content the company does n't like			1
@entity10 , which partners with app developers as a sort of clearinghouse to help them get noticed , was first informed friday that it was being pulled , according to ceo @entity15			2
the app disappeared from the @entity16 on sunday			2
@entity15 said he 'd been on a plane to @entity18 and arrived to discover more than 75 missed phone calls and " a seemingly unlimited flow " of text messages			0
" i immediately thought that someone in my family had passed away during my flight and could n't touch my phone for a few minutes , " @entity15 wrote in a blog post			0
trying to imagine what the terrible news could be			0
" @entity5 said the app , created in 2008 , was pulled for violating a pair of its developer guidelines -- one that bars displaying apps for purchase " in a manner similar to or confusing with the @entity16 " and another that bans push notifications that contain advertising or " marketing of any kind			1
" @entity15 said that @entity5 had approved an @entity43 version of the app , which has roughly 12 million @entity45 users , just a week before the apps were banned			1
@entity5 did not immediately respond wednesday to a request for additional comment			2
@entity15 said the company has addressed the @entity16 issue before , apparently arguing successfully that @entity10 is n't similar to @entity5 's closely policed sales environment			1
as far as push notifications , he said the app sends one a day , saying " today 's deal is here , " and that users can opt out of getting it			2
talking to an @entity5 contact did n't make it any clearer , he wrote			2
" i asked how he and his team could have possibly changed their minds overnight , pretty much pulling the plug on a 45 - person company , " @entity15 said			0
" he seemed very detached regarding the gravity of the situation , and was unable to let me know on what specifics these decisions had been made			0
" @entity15 questioned why similar apps had n't been banned			0
according to at least one report , it might not be long			0
@entity74 's @entity73 blog reported that the ban was the first step in a new wave crackdowns by @entity5 on " app - discovery " apps			1
citing " sources familiar with @entity5 's thinking , " the report said @entity5 thinks those apps " threaten the legitimacy of the @entity16 " by letting developers pay their way to a high ranking			1
@entity5 famously keeps tight controls on its @entity16 , not allowing any app in without prior approval			1
the company argues it 's a quality - control issue that keeps out sub-standard content			0
many critics prefer a more open - ended approach like @entity96 's @entity95 for @entity98 devices , which give developers significantly more leeway			0
@entity15 said @entity10 will continue to be updated for people who have already downloaded it and that he 'll keep trying to work with @entity5 to find a solution .			1
