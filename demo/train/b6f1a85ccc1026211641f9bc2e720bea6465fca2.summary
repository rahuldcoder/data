-- @entity1 is a paradox			1
if you saw a photo of him and did n't know who he was , you might assume from the square jaw , trappings of wealth and arcane haircut that he was the perfect country - club @entity12			1
but that would be too simple , especially in this election			2
@entity1 only looks like an insider			1
but in many ways , he has remained an outsider			0
politics : @entity1 's ' all ' proved not enough for one thing , the @entity21 presidential ticket , which lost the election tuesday to president @entity23 and vice president @entity24 , was the first in history not to include a @entity28			1
( @entity1 would have been the first @entity29 president , rep. @entity30 is catholic			1
) he 's a @entity12 who won election in a blue state			1
the people of @entity35 may know the former governor as a bipartisan moderate , yet he sold himself on the national stage as " severely conservative			1
" in his own state , he invented what many regard as the prototype for @entity42 , yet he repeatedly vowed to repeal @entity23 's version of it			0
@entity45 : @entity23 's win wo n't transform @entity47 is he moderate or is he conservative ? the same question could be asked of the @entity12 -- and the @entity12 's own lack of ideological clarity is probably the exact reason why it nominated him			1
cometh the hour , cometh the multidimensional man			0
today 's republicans find themselves in a dilemma			0
on the one hand , they have an enormous base of hyped - up voters who passionately subscribe to economic and social conservatism			0
they needed to energize that base to win			2
on the other hand , the margin of victory rested with a group of moderates and independents who like their politics a little more practical			0
the challenge of 2012 was to take the @entity70 agenda and rebrand it so that it could still appeal to the right but also win converts in the center			2
that was @entity1 's job -- and he did n't quite pull it off			1
yet , if anyone could have , it would have been @entity1			1
why @entity79 hates @entity23 i suspect that the @entity12 nominated @entity1 partly because he spent so much money acquiring the nomination but also because his personality seemed suitably vague			1
to be assigned to report on his rallies carried all the thrill of being asked to submit a 10,000 - word critical analysis of a church picnic			0
his speeches were flat at best and goofy at worst			0
his attire was sensible trousers and shirt with the sleeves rolled up , and the family was so wholesomely large that you sensed they could swing a primary just by registering the grandkids			0
but squareness was just what the @entity12 was looking for			1
in an era of recession , his business experience seemed like a big plus and his polished - yet - gentle style was a nice contrast to @entity23 's flashy rhetoric			2
it was understood that he had been a technocratic governor of @entity35 , with a record on social issues that at times wandered a bit to the left			0
as i always explained to my @entity115 colleagues bemused at the irresistible rise of @entity1 , one of his greatest strengths was that he did n't look crazy			1
you could trust this man with the nuclear codes , whereas putting the entire arsenal of the free world in the hands of one of his primary challengers , like @entity128 or @entity129 , felt risky			0
but to win the primaries , @entity1 still needed the votes of that big block of conservatives			1
so he underwent a rebranding			0
for the record , the conservative movement never entirely bought @entity1 's conversion			1
that 's why he lost @entity139 to @entity128 and @entity140 to @entity141			0
thereafter he was dogged for some weeks by @entity128 , whose electoral coalition tended to be poorer , more religious , more conservative and more rural			0
in these truly competitive primaries , @entity1 's vote was often rich , moderate and elderly ( no wonder mr. @entity145 was such a fan )			1
@entity1 was , in fact , the country - club candidate			1
he won primaries largely thanks to the support of people like him , and he only won because there are so many people like him in the @entity12			1
but all the while , his empty pitch to the @entity12 base moved him rhetorically further and further to the right			1
share your opinions on the election results of course , philosophical conservatism is n't necessarily an electoral negative for the @entity12			1
it worked for @entity163 in the 1980s and @entity164 in the 2000s			0
but whereas @entity168 populism is programmatic ( health care for all , tax the rich ) for the @entity12 it has tended to be personal ( dress like a cowboy , eat tv dinners )			2
the problem was that @entity1 lacked the requisite performance skills -- he 's no @entity163 -- which ended up converting his greatest strength into his greatest weakness			2
with unemployment running high and debt spiraling out of control , we might have expected @entity1 's ability to make money to be a plus			2
instead , it only emphasized his difference from you and me			0
he had money nestling in the @entity189			0
he only paid 14.1 % on a fortune that would make @entity192 blush			0
worst of all , he had worked in private equity , and while he helped save a lot of jobs , he was probably responsible for downsizing a few , too			0
@entity1 insisted that he left @entity196 before it committed its greatest sins , but the image of @entity1 cheerfully declaring , " i like being able to fire people " stuck in the minds of many voters			2
@entity1 's broader appeal was buried beneath a wave of scandal and political character assassination			2
it was the debates that allowed him to regain control of the narrative			0
in that first debate he was clever , funny , energetic and passionate -- and in many ways outclassed @entity23			0
my theory is that @entity1 flourished because the format was like a corporate job interview : question after question , a little light sparring , an emphasis upon " pep " ( " @entity222 , i 'd just love to run your country			2
when can i start ? ! " )			0
the inner - intern shone through and @entity1 behaved like a smart kid out of college who 's hungry to get his foot on the corporate ladder			2
@entity230 : five things @entity23 must do his performance was so good that it was historic , transforming the election in a way that few have ever done			0
it worked because @entity1 did what the @entity12 was waiting for him to do all year			1
he appealed to the center by sounding reasonable and moderate but he also fired up the base by saying things to @entity23 that they wanted to hear said			2
this was @entity1 at his very best -- and it 's difficult to image an alternative candidate who could have done better			2
but , ultimately , the contradictions inherent within both @entity1 and his party simply could n't be overcome			1
the need to be both conservative and moderate confused and frustrated the electorate who were never quite sure what they were voting for			1
so the advantage fell to the incumbent			0
the ambivalent @entity47 public went with the devil they knew			0
what next for @entity1 ? do n't be surprised if he returns to his church			1
he 's a man of faith with a record of charity and it would be in keeping for him to dedicate himself to others			0
i hope the conservative movement and the pundits will be just as charitable to him the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity267 .			1

@entity267 : @entity1 , who lost presidential election , has long been paradox
@entity267 : @entity1 was moderate @entity12 in @entity272 ; later became " severely conservative "
he says @entity12 wanted a polished technocrat ; @entity1 shifted *rightward* to win conservatives
@entity267 : his contradications could n't be overcome for frustrated electorate
