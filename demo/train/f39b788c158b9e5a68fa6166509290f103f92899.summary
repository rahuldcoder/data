@entity0 -- @entity4 was flying far slower than recommended as it approached @entity5 just before its crash landing on saturday , the head of the @entity3 said monday			1
the @entity8 was traveling at approximately 106 knots ( 122 mph ) upon impact and at about 118 knots ( 136 mph ) 16 seconds before impact at an altitude of about 200 feet ; the recommended speed upon approach to the runway threshold is 137 knots ( 157 mph ) , @entity7 told reporters			1
the onboard systems warned the crew the plane was about to stall four seconds before the crash , she said			1
that warning comes in the form of a " stick - shaker , " said @entity23 , a pilot , engineer and partner with the @entity27 - based law firm @entity26 , which specializes in litigation stemming from plane crashes			1
" it 's basically saying , ' hey idiot , wake up and do something ... now ! " that something typically is to lower the nose of the plane and apply power , he said			1
the plane was already close to the ground and could n't be lowered much further			1
but the crew apparently boosted the power to the engines , which were increasing from 50 % capacity three seconds before impact , according to @entity7			0
one - and - a - half seconds before impact , the crew called for a " go - around , " meaning that they wanted to abort the landing and go around in the air to try to make another landing , she said			1
but they did n't make it			0
" there just was n't enough room to recover , " @entity23 said			0
investigators have found a path of wreckage that started at the seawall and continued to the main wreckage site hundreds of feet up the runway , @entity7 added			0
the pavement itself was scarred from contact with the landing gear , the engines and the fuselage , @entity7 said			1
the tail 's lower portion was in the rocks at the seawall and " a significant piece of the tail " was in the water , she said			1
additional aircraft parts were visible at low tide			0
on the path that leads along the pavement away from the seawall were horizontal stabilizers , a vertical stabilizer and an upper portion of the tail cone , she said			0
the air - traffic control team found no evidence on voice communications of any distress calls before the accident , she said			0
but investigators have found that the pilots had the appropriate charts for the airport and approach in place in the cockpit , she added			1
the @entity3 was working to find out what the four pilots had done during the 72 hours before the crash in an attempt to determine whether fatigue or sickness may have played a role , she said			1
a preliminary review of @entity104 radar data indicates that there was " no abnormally steep descent curve that 's been detected " in the landing approach of the jet , she said , reacting to media reports citing a steeper descent			1
and a preliminary review of the engines indicates that both engines were producing power when the plane crashed , she said			2
investigators were focusing on the crew and aircraft as they try to learn why the giant jet clipped the end of runway before crashing , she had said earlier in the day			0
" we 're certainly looking at the crew and how they operated , how they were trained , at their experience , " @entity7 told @entity1 's @entity123			2
" we 're also looking at the aircraft			0
we 're looking to see if the crew was using automation or was flying on autopilot , or they were hand - flying the airplane , " she said			0
@entity8 777s can land automatically , but it was unclear if the plane 's computer was handling saturday 's attempted landing or if it was being done by the pilot , who @entity139 said was making his first @entity0 landing at the controls of that model of aircraft			1
the flight , with 307 people on board , originated in @entity146 , @entity147 , and stopped in @entity148 , @entity149			0
it was preparing to land saturday in @entity0 when the rear of the plane struck the edge of the runway , severing the tail			1
most passengers were able to escape before the plane erupted in smoke and flames			2
the fatalities , teenagers @entity161 and @entity163 , were among 35 @entity147 students headed to @entity166 to attend @entity168 's summer church camp , the school said on its website			2
both of the girls had been seated in the rear of the plane , which suffered significant structural damage , @entity7 said			2
investigators said they were looking into reports that one of the girls may have been run over by an emergency vehicle			0
" we are still looking at this issue , " she said			0
" the coroner has not yet determined the cause of death and so we want to make sure we have all the facts before we reach any conclusions			0
" @entity147 netizens mourn @entity139 crash victims @entity189 's flight record @entity191 , the pilot who was in the captain 's seat of @entity4 , had flown from @entity148 to @entity0 several times between 1999 and 2004 , the airline said			1
but saturday marked his first time landing a @entity8 at @entity5 and was the ninth time he had flown the model , with 43 hours at the controls , the airline said			1
he has about 10,000 hours as a pilot , @entity139 said			2
@entity7 , who has discouraged speculation about whether the crew bore responsibility for the crash , downplayed the significance of the pilot 's experience in her @entity123 interview			1
" it 's not unusual for crew to change aircraft types , " she said			2
and with air crews flying all around the world , it 's not unusual for pilots to fly into unfamiliar airports for the first time either			1
she said it 's important for the two pilots in charge of the aircraft during the " very risky " landing phase to work closely together , and while she said investigators have no evidence of cockpit communications problems , it 's something investigators will be looking at			1
@entity228 , a former inspector general for the @entity230 @entity229 , said video and other data related to the crash suggest the crew " lost situational awareness " while approaching the airport			2
' oh , lord have mercy ' : witness captures fatal jet crash " they 're low and slow , and that 's a problem , " @entity228 said			2
all four pilots have been interviewed by @entity3 and @entity149 investigators , said @entity244 , the head of @entity149 's @entity245			1
" we can not reveal what 's been said as it is an ongoing investigation , " @entity244 said			2
the pilots represented two teams -- a crew and a relief crew , said @entity7			0
" i think it really is too early to conclude pilot error , because there is so much that we do n't know , " she told @entity1 's @entity253			1
the cockpit voice recorder -- which has been flown to @entity258 for analysis -- contains conversations between the pilots that were carried out in a combination of @entity263 and @entity149 , she said			0
@entity7 said that in most airplane crashes , investigators rarely find a single explanation for what went wrong			0
" in most of our investigations , we find that it 's not just one thing , it really is a combination of factors that lead to an accident , " she said			2
while weather has been ruled out as a factor , other factors officials are investigating include whether construction at the airport may have played a role , @entity7 said sunday			2
work to extend a runway safety area required the temporary shutdown of a system designed to help pilots land planes safely , she said			0
what we know and do n't know clues from voice recorder the pilots apparently tried to speed up seven seconds before the crash , cockpit voice and flight data recorders showed			0
a stall warning sounded three seconds later , telling the pilots the plane was about to lose its ability to stay in the air			2
then -- just 1.5 seconds before the plane slammed into the runway -- the crew decided to call off the landing and try to pull up for another try , @entity7 said			1
moments before crash , passengers knew they were too low the frightening crash with no warning from the cockpit , survivors said , the plane 's rear struck the sea wall at the end of the runway			1
the impact severed the plane 's tail and sent the rest of the body spinning on its belly			1
amateur video obtained exclusively by @entity1 shows the plane crashing and spinning counterclockwise and coming to a stop			0
in addition to the two deaths , 182 people were hospitalized with injuries ranging from severe scrapes to paralysis			0
" we 're lucky there has n't been a greater loss of life , " @entity0 fire chief @entity328 said			1
some injured passengers remained hospitalized monday , including six in critical condition at @entity335 , said dr. @entity336 , the hospital 's chief of surgery			1
about half of those admitted to the hospital had spinal fractures , she said			0
" their recovery could be months and months and maybe not even to full recovery , " she said			0
many of the injured said they were sitting toward the rear of the aircraft , @entity336 said			0
but 123 of the 307 people on board walked away uninjured			0
" honestly , i was waiting for the plane to ... start flipping upside down , in which case i think a lot of people would have not made it , " @entity352 said			0
" if we flipped , none of us would be here to talk about it , " he said			0
@entity1 's @entity363 and @entity364 reported and wrote from @entity365 ; @entity366 reported from @entity0 ; @entity1 's @entity367 , @entity368 , @entity369 , @entity370 and @entity371 contributed to this report			1

@entity376 : " too early to conclude pilot error , " @entity3 chief says
the agency is also looking to see if the plane 's computer was handling landing
saturday marked the pilot 's first time landing a @entity8 at the @entity0 airport
