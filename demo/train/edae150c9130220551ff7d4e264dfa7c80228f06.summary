on wednesday the @entity1 fined @entity4 a record $ 1.45 billion for violating anti-trust laws			1
the ruling , which @entity4 plans to appeal , may have future implications for @entity15 companies accused of " jurisdiction shopping " to avoid anti-trust verdicts against them , says @entity0 's @entity19 , who explains the basics of the @entity4 case			1
the commission has hit @entity4 with the biggest fine ever -- what were its reasons ? the @entity1 says @entity4 has been abusing its dominant market position in semiconductors for years			1
the @entity1 says @entity4 has systematically given pc makers and stores rebates to keep computers with @entity32 chips off the shelves			1
@entity32 ( another @entity15 company and @entity4 's only competitor ) first raised the red flag in 2000			1
why does the commission have the power to impose such fines ? @entity41 law does not regard market dominance as illegal , but it is allowed to fine a company that abuses its position as the biggest in any given market			2
it has a guideline of fining a company based on a percentage of profits			0
@entity41 law is set up to " protect consumers , " and the anti-trust office says consumers were hurt			0
yet as @entity4 likes to point out , consumers did not launch this case -- @entity32 , a competitor , launched this in @entity58 ( and in @entity59 and @entity60 ) as the @entity15 antitrust officials under @entity62 were unlikely to pursue a case on these merits			1
the @entity41 could fine @entity4 ( or any company ) based on 10 % of global annual revenues , but chose to fine it on a smaller percentage made in the @entity41			0
can @entity4 afford to pay this fine ? what state is the company in at the moment ? @entity4 reported first quarter revenue of $ 7 billion			2
it can easily afford this			0
interestingly , it lost 4 percent of its market share to @entity32 so far this year			0
the company says it will appeal -- when is that likely to be heard ? another appeal will take months			0
@entity4 already appealed a preliminary part of this ruling last year and lost			0
meanwhile , the @entity1 can argue that @entity4 is still abusing its position and increase the fine during the appeals process , as it did to @entity82			1
@entity4 is not the first tech company to be hit by the @entity1			2
what about @entity82 ? the anti-trust unit has launched another round of investigations against @entity82			1
it has already paid its fine and the @entity41 continues to watch the company 's behavior on the previous matters			0
what kind of precedent does the @entity4 case set ? the @entity41 has fined all kinds of cartels and market abusers , but rarely does it fine big @entity15 companies based on complaints from @entity15 competitors -- so the case catches the eye , especially with critics who accuse @entity15 companies of " jurisdiction shopping " to get a favorable outcome .			2
