@entity1 , @entity0 was an @entity4 hostage held in @entity5 killed by a @entity0 airstrike ? that 's what @entity8 said in an online posting friday , claiming that she died in the group 's de facto capital , @entity14			1
the posting friday included a picture of a collapsed building and a claim that the woman -- confirmed by her family to be @entity21 -- was being held there			1
but it did not show a body or provide any proof of death			0
@entity0 government spokesman @entity26 said his country is looking into the claim			0
but , he said , " we are highly skeptical " because of @entity8 's proven lack of credibility , and he questioned whether they could identify @entity0 warplanes so high in the sky or would hold a hostage in a " weapon warehouse			1
" later , he told @entity2 that @entity8 uses " these events to manipulate facts and to manipulate public opinion			1
" " what we know about this terrorist organization is that they are liars when it comes to these things , " @entity26 told " @entity45 with @entity46			0
" interior minister @entity47 also knocked down the report , calling it another " pr stunt " by @entity8			1
" they tried to cause problems internally in @entity0 and have n't succeeded , " @entity47 said			0
" they are now trying to drive a wedge between the coalition with this latest low pr stunt			0
" @entity8 has held a number of hostages from the @entity4 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
as of now , at least two westerners are thought to be in its custody : @entity58 journalist @entity63 , who has appeared in a number of @entity8 - produced videos , and the @entity4 woman , who is a 26 - year - old aid worker			1
@entity2 has not previously named @entity21 because of a request from the family			1
friday night , her parents , @entity70 and @entity71 of @entity72 , @entity73 , issued a statement asking the people holding their daughter to contact them			2
" after going to extraordinary efforts to keep @entity21 's name out of the media for so long , by securing the cooperation of journalists throughout the world , her name was released today			1
this news leaves us concerned , yet , we are still hopeful that @entity21 is alive			2
we have sent you a private message and ask that you respond to us privately			0
" asked about @entity8 's claim of the woman 's death in @entity14 , @entity89 spokeswoman @entity88 said that she could not " confirm those reports in any way			1
" " obviously ( we are ) deeply concerned ... , " she added			0
" we have not , at this point , seen anything that corroborates ( @entity8 's ) claims			1
" the @entity72 , @entity73 , native was taken captive in august 2013 in @entity100 , @entity5 , after leaving a @entity102 hospital , her family said			2
before that , @entity21 graduated from @entity104 and spent years traversing the world -- including @entity106 , @entity107 and her native @entity73 , where she worked in an hiv / aids clinic and volunteered at a women 's shelter			1
her going to @entity5 in late 2012 with the @entity110 and support to life humanitarian agency aligned with that same mission to help others			2
what drove her ? according to her family , @entity21 would say , " i find @entity115 in the suffering eyes reflected in mine			2
if this is how you are revealed to me , this is how you are revealed to me , this is how i will forever seek you			0
" according to a source close to the family , @entity8 had set a deadline of august 13 , 2014 , for a 5 million @entity126 ransom to be paid or the group would kill her			2
when it comes to @entity8 , there 's plenty of reason for skepticism			1
most of its hostages have been executed by the terror group , which then touted the grisly deaths online			0
that was the case with @entity0 pilot @entity140 , who was captured by the @entity144 extremist group after his f - 16 fighter jet crashed while on an @entity147 mission near @entity14			0
@entity148 emerged tuesday of @entity8 burning him alive while he was locked in a cage			2
after the video came out , @entity0 officials said they have reason to believe @entity140 was actually killed in early january			2
that suggested that during the month between , while signaling its openness to a prisoner exchange with @entity0 , @entity8 had known all along that the pilot was dead			2
@entity2 terrorism analyst @entity158 is among those very dubious that @entity8 is telling the truth this time around , including its claim that the @entity4 hostage was alone in the building and that no militants died in the strike			1
" it seems very , very convenient for propaganda purposes , from the @entity8 point of view , " @entity158 said			2
@entity2 law enforcement analyst @entity169 also cast doubt			2
the buildings in the photo are damaged but there is no smoke			0
if the pictures were taken just after an airstrike , there would be smoke from smoldering debris , he said			0
@entity182 lt. col. @entity181 , a @entity2 global affairs analyst , says it 's plausible a hostage may have been inadvertently killed in @entity5			1
" we all know that ( the @entity4 - led military coalition 's ) intelligence ... in @entity5 is not as good as we have in @entity188 now , " @entity181 said			1
" so it is plausible ( @entity21 was killed ) , and it could be unfortunate			1
but sometimes ... that happens in these wars			0
" though there is no evidence @entity21 was killed , @entity4 intelligence and law enforcement agencies are working on a theory that she may have died weeks or months ago , sources said			1
intelligence and law enforcement sources said the theory comes from prior intelligence on her captivity and @entity8 ' past behavior with hostages			2
the claim of the @entity0 airstrike killing her likely is a convenient way for @entity8 to explain why it killed a woman , which could be problematic for its message , the sources said			1
this all comes in the wake of @entity140 's horrific killing , which spurred outrage in @entity0 and beyond			0
his father , @entity217 , afterward called on @entity0 and its allies to " annihilate " isis			0
government officials appear , at least in their rhetoric , determined to do just that			0
" ( @entity0 will extract ) revenge that equals the tragedy that has befallen the @entity0 , " government spokesman @entity223 said			0
on thursday -- a day after executing two jihadists in retaliation -- the @entity227 nation launched its first strikes since the news emerged about @entity140			0
a squadron of warplanes from the @entity235 on friday carried out a number of strikes against @entity8 targets , the military said in statement			2
the @entity0 armed forces did not immediately provide details on the number of aircraft nor what targets were hit			0
activists told @entity2 that one strike killed 47 @entity8 fighters			1
until now , @entity8 has n't shown any inclination to back down			2
just the opposite , in fact : the terror group has been relentless and brutal in its quest to establish a vast caliphate under its strict , twisted version of @entity256 law			0
the organization 's savagery seemingly knows no bounds , not only in its use of captives ' killings as grisly propaganda tools but in its campaign of mass killings , rapes , kidnappings and other atrocities while taking over swaths of @entity188 and @entity5			1
just this week , a @entity271 report claimed @entity8 has stepped up its use of children in its bloody campaign , even putting price tags on some and selling them as slaves			2
@entity279 's killing was an attempt by @entity8 " to instill terror and fear in the hearts of its enemies , " making them less willing to provoke or put up a fight , says a prominent @entity288 cleric who has been exiled from @entity5			1
" what 's happening is the opposite , " @entity289 told @entity2 's @entity290 this week			1
" the martyrdom of @entity294 has united @entity295 ... against @entity8 , leaving no slight room of doubt that these people do not represent @entity299			0
they represent savagery , terrorism and extremism			0
" that seems to be the sentiment in @entity0 , at least , where citizens rallied again friday in @entity1 to honor @entity140 and condemn his killers			0
thousands filled the @entity309 there , listening to a sermon decrying @entity8 as antithetical to @entity299 and insisting that @entity295 can not stand idly by			0
after prayers , crowds spilled out onto the streets to march calmly and defiantly toward @entity315			0
many held up banners and signs -- including @entity319 , with a poster that read , " @entity294 , the martyr of justice " -- and chanted , " @entity316			0
" @entity0 for months has been one of a handful of nations in the region taking part in the @entity4 - led coalition , a fight it continued with airstrikes thursday and friday at different sites around @entity188 and @entity5			1
for all the efforts of the @entity4 and its allies , @entity333 , the interior minister , told @entity2 that the fight is personal for his fellow @entity0			1
and @entity336 has given " carte blanche ... to the armed forces " to carry it out , @entity47 said			0
" this is definitely not the @entity4 's war			1
this is definitely our war , " said @entity47			0
" ... i do n't want to equate ourselves with this evil force ( @entity8 ) , but we will ( take ) revenge for our pilot			0
" @entity2 's @entity348 reported from @entity0 and @entity349 and @entity350 wrote this report from @entity352			1
@entity2 's @entity353 , @entity354 , @entity355 , @entity356 , @entity357 , @entity358 , @entity359 , @entity360 , @entity361 and @entity362 contributed to this report .			1
