@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 @entity5 vowed on thursday to kill @entity6 , the jailed @entity1 doctor accused of helping the @entity7 in the search for @entity9 , a spokesman for the militant group told @entity2			1
" we will cut him into pieces when we find him , " @entity1 @entity5 spokesman @entity10 told @entity2 by phone			1
" he spied for the @entity15 to hunt down our hero @entity9			1
" @entity1 officials say @entity6 is being held in a prison in the city of @entity20 in northwest @entity1			1
last week a court in @entity1 's tribal region sentenced @entity6 to 33 years in prison but a copy of the court order obtained by @entity2 shows @entity6 was sentenced for alleged connections to the militant group @entity27 , not for helping @entity15 in the search for @entity9			1
even so , the @entity1 @entity5 says @entity6 is the number - one target on its hit list			1
on wednesday the jailed doctor 's brother told @entity2 he fears for @entity6 's safety and called on the @entity15 to help set him free			1
" these allegations are false			0
they 're baseless , " said @entity35			0
" my brother did n't do anything against @entity1			0
if he helped the @entity15 , it was for the benefit of @entity1			0
the @entity15 government should help us in any way it can			0
" officials had told @entity45 was charged with treason for spying for the @entity15			2
he was accused of helping the @entity7 locate @entity9 in his compound in @entity48 through a fake vaccination campaign			1
@entity9 was killed in the subsequent @entity15 raid on the compound in may last year			2
at least one legal analyst said @entity6 's sentence is a sham			2
@entity0 - based lawyer @entity55 questioned the legitimacy of the court proceedings , since the punishment was handed down by a tribal court in @entity60 even though the alleged offense occurred in @entity48			1
the @entity6 verdict sparked anger in the @entity15 and further strained relations between @entity65 and @entity0			2
the tensions surfaced as @entity67 debated aid to @entity1 in several bills			0
in the @entity71 , senators agreed last week to withhold @entity1 's part of a $ 1.75 billion aid package because of outrage over @entity6 's case and the continued blockade of @entity78 supply routes into and out of @entity79			0
another bill in the @entity81 withheld $ 33 million in aid to @entity1 for similar reasons			0
@entity1 interior minister @entity84 has said cutting aid is a @entity15 prerogative , but added : " i think the @entity15 should not forget we are a victim in this war on terror and we 're suffering for the international community , too			0
