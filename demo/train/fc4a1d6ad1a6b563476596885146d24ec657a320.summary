@entity0 , @entity1 -- when we started thinking about the contents of this piece , our first thought was to highlight all of the progress , accomplishments and successes that the @entity10 has achieved since @entity11			1
we thought of numbers : 302 -- the number of homes that the @entity10 has rebuilt ; 85 -- the number of residents who utilize our free evidenced - based clinical services at our @entity17 each week			0
we thought of all of those who have made it possible : 25,000 volunteers ; nearly 1,000 @entity22 members ; companies like @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , and citizens like @entity30 , who has made 20 volunteer trips over the past four years , and the @entity33 family from @entity34 , who has raised enough funds to move three families home and who spent the summer volunteering with the project			1
then , we remembered mr. @entity40 , an 82 - year old @entity41 resident who was a @entity42 veteran and who , when we met him six months after @entity11 was still sleeping each night in his @entity44 pickup while waiting for a @entity46 trailer that he would not receive for another six weeks			0
as we were saying goodbye to mr. @entity40 , he made a simple request : " do n't forget us			0
we want to come home			0
we all want to come home			0
" when we thought about mr. @entity40 , we realized a few things : first , the @entity10 's successes are dwarfed by the progress that the greater @entity0 area has made			1
second , despite the progress , significant work is left			1
the @entity0 area is a wonderful place to live , and the city is , in many ways , thriving			1
families are reuniting , neighborhoods are being restored , and there is a shared sense of pride in the region 's resilience			1
in mayor @entity69 , we have a leader who is committed to uniting the city and bringing to government the true character of @entity0 ' residents : inclusion , hard work and problem solving			1
an entrepreneurial movement is surging through the city , led by @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			0
thanks to @entity84 for @entity0 , there are dozens of highly effective charter schools , like @entity86 , and because of a revitalized public school board , the chances are much better that children will receive the education that they deserve			1
nearly five years after @entity11 , we need to celebrate success , but we also need to honor mr. @entity40 's request			2
we can not forget the people who are not yet home			0
all of the above - mentioned successes are great , but they mean less to @entity98 families who are still waiting to move home			2
today , nearly 900 families who own homes are still living in @entity46 trailers			2
more than 6,000 families own homes that they can not afford to rebuild			2
rental prices have risen so that 49 percent of the population can not afford the average cost of a home to rent			0
all too many family - centered neighborhoods now are pocked with blighted houses or vacant lots			0
as much as we would all like it to be , the recovery is not complete			0
that is where @entity117 quarterback @entity116 and his war cry come in			1
to keep our pledge to mr. @entity40 , all stakeholders -- @entity1 citizens , volunteers from around the world , corporations and local , state and federal government -- need to follow the command @entity116 made to his fellow @entity117 late last football season and " finish strong			1
" in football , finishing strong means playing hard through all four quarters and through every game of the season			2
in @entity1 's recovery , finishing strong means : governmental leadership that makes decisions that impact residents in ways that the leaders would want their own families to be impacted			1
creating schools so that our community members ' children are educated the way that we would want our children to be educated			0
@entity98 and corporations not viewing community as being limited by proximity and instead , like the hundreds of thousands of volunteers , working hard to help @entity98 families rebuild their homes			2
understanding that the recovery is not complete until all residents are back in safe and humane homes			0
by following @entity116 's command , the @entity117 won the @entity158			1
by remembering mr. @entity40 's words and by listening to @entity116 , we can win the recovery			0

@entity165 was 2008 @entity166 for her work in @entity0
she and *co-founder* of her *nonprofit* say much has been accomplished in five years
still , they say , many families lack *acceptable* housing
@entity0 needs to " finish strong " the way the @entity117 did in the @entity178 , co-authors say
