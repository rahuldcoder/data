-- @entity1 became the first @entity3 male to reach the quarterfinals of the @entity5 since 1932 when he held on to earn a shock five - set win over sixth seed @entity8 on monday			1
@entity1 , ranked 26th in the world , blew a two - set lead before beating the @entity12 for the second time in his career , triumphing 2 - 6 6 - 2 6 - 1 3 - 6 6 - 3 in three and a half hours			1
the 22 - year - old , who will next face world no. 4 @entity16 , beat his previous best grand slam performance -- reaching the fourth round of the @entity19			1
he is the first @entity3 male player to reach the last eight of one of the four majors since @entity23 at @entity24 in 1995			1
" this is the first quarterfinal for me , " an exhausted @entity1 , told reporters after his second successive five - set match			1
" i feel i 'm stepping up			0
it was tough because he was still playing well in the fifth			0
i was having trouble with making returns			0
i started getting nervous ... but still i was playing aggressive on important points			0
i was making good serves			0
so that helped me to get the games			0
" @entity1 beat world no. 1 @entity37 in the @entity40 semis in october before losing to @entity41 , having learned a lesson in his thrashing by @entity16 in the last four in @entity44 in his preceding tournament			1
" he kind of destroyed me			0
but i have no pressure now			0
he 's one of the players i have to play like him			2
i learn a lot of things from him			0
it 's going to be tough , but i try to do my best tennis			2
" @entity1 said he hoped he could inspire @entity54 men 's players , as @entity56 's @entity55 did for the region 's women last year by reaching the @entity5 final and then winning the @entity60			1
" it 's an honor to make a lot of histories , to be the no. 1 player in @entity3			1
but that never gives me pressure , " said @entity1 , who is a graduate of the @entity66 academy in @entity67 which has produced many top players such as @entity69 , the @entity71 sisters and @entity72			1
. " there 's a lot of good players in @entity78			2
but , yeah , i 'm happy to get to the top from @entity78 , and hopefully i can be like @entity55 for the men			2
" fourth seed @entity16 , the runner - up in @entity83 for the last two years , was coasting 6 - 1 6 - 1 1 - 0 against @entity85 's @entity84 when the world no. 92 was forced to retire with a left hip flexor injury			1
" i 'll definitely be fresh for the next few rounds hopefully , " said @entity16 , who has yet to win a first grand slam title despite reaching four finals			1
" i just need to make sure i do the right things the next couple days to get ready for the quarters			0
" top seed and defending champion @entity37 survived a spirited third - set fightback from former world no. 1 and home - crowd favorite @entity96 to seal a 6 - 1 6 - 3 4 - 6 6 - 3 triumph in the late match			1
@entity96 , granted a wildcard for the tournament after a long fitness struggle has seen him dropped to 181st in the rankings , showed glimpses of the form which took him to two grand slam titles			1
but @entity37 -- a four - time grand slam winner including three major titles in 2011 -- eventually proved too strong and the @entity111 world no. 1 eventually saw off the 30 - year - old @entity96 in just under three hours in a match that went past 1 a.m. local time			1
" i played some loose points and got him back into the match			0
but credit to him as well for being competitive , for not giving up , " @entity37 said			1
" this is something you can expect from @entity96 who is very well - known for his fighting spirit			2
he had the crowd , he had the big support			0
especially the start of the fourth set we had some great rallies			2
" fifth seed @entity128 awaits @entity37 in the next round after the @entity131 eased to a 6 - 4 6 - 4 6 - 1 victory against @entity12 no. 17 @entity133			1
seventh seed @entity134 booked his place in the last eight with a four - set success against @entity141 no. 10 @entity139 on sunday , but the @entity142 was booed by the @entity144 crowd for refusing to shake his opponent 's hand at the end of the match			2
it followed an incident in the fourth set where @entity134 accused @entity139 of purposefully aiming a volley at his face , with the ball striking him on the arm			0
" whoever has played the tennis knows that the court is pretty big , and you always have some space to put the ball in , " said @entity134 told reporters			0
" and not even if you stand each other like three or four meters close to the guy , just try to hit it straight to your face , you know			0
i was just able and lucky to somehow fell down			0
" i already take it as a past , it 's just one thing that what happened from the side of @entity139 ... so i think if they want to look at it like that , then i think maybe we both did some mistake			0
" @entity134 's last - eight opponent will be 2009 champion @entity178 , the second seed who beat fellow @entity131 @entity179 6 - 4 6 - 4 6 - 2 .			2
