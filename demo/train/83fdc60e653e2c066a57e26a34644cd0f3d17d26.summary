when i first heard @entity2 , as a child , i thought they walked into the recording studio with a genius idea and they executed that idea perfectly			1
every note , every word , every @entity8 was planned and just had to be laid down on wax			0
the @entity2 were geniuses and that 's how geniuses created works of art. i had never met anyone who created real music and i figured musicians had ideas for sounds in their heads and then performed them			1
that was the job and to do it you had to be a genius			2
then i bought my first bootleg record			2
stamped on the plain jacket were the words " @entity29 " and the record store had it filed under @entity2			1
i kind of knew what i was buying			0
i knew these were recordings of @entity2 that @entity2 had n't wanted released			1
i was a @entity33 : remembering @entity2 ' @entity35 invasion there was n't even shrink - wrap to unseal with my thumbnail before i put it on the turntable			1
the song titles were n't listed on the label , there was just a picture of a pig and a hole in the record that was n't even centered			2
this was dirty and wrong			0
it turns out the bootleg of " @entity29 " i had was not even the real bootleg of the @entity53 acetate			2
it was another collection of @entity2 stuff misnamed to cash in on the first @entity2 bootleg			1
in my town we got counterfeit bootlegs			0
as i turned up my mom 's record player loud what i heard changed my life			0
i heard @entity2 making mistakes			1
i heard them fumbling around to find their genius			2
it was mostly outtakes from " @entity68			0
" " @entity68 " was supposed to be funkier , dirtier , and more live sounding than " @entity70 , " but my inexperienced ears did n't understand that			2
the released album , even with " dig it " and " @entity75 " and @entity77 's inappropriate production was perfect to me			0
even the giggles on " @entity68 " had seemed planned to me			0
but this bootleg had @entity81 singing out of tune ! it had versions of the songs that were different			1
it had @entity2 trying different tempos , different lyrics and different ideas			1
video : the @entity92 : the @entity94 invasion i still believe @entity2 started with ideas			1
they had feelings in their hearts and thoughts in their minds they wanted to express			0
but learning that they did n't have perfect blueprints from their genius was a revelation			1
it inspired me to start to practice and rehearse the stupid ideas that i had			0
armed with nothing more than the knowledge that @entity2 had to work on the records , i started learning to juggle and do magic			1
it 's been way more than 20 years ago today and i still have n't finished my juggling / magic @entity70 's , but i 'm still working			2
i 've met a lot of musicians , and they bang around a lot before they come up with the finished track , or the finished composition			0
i 've learned that writing books , essays , and magic patter is mostly editing			0
no matter how clear the idea is , you have to monkey with it			0
even @entity123 crosses things out and starts again			0
the @entity125 has his notes on display to prove that			0
( although i still believe it 's possible that @entity123 fabricated those mistakes after the fact just to test our faith , like some creationists believe god created confusing fossils			2
) in comedy @entity137 and @entity138 are often held up as two ends of the discovery / vision continuum			0
lore is that @entity137 would monkey around on the set trying all sorts of things until something seemed right and @entity138 supposedly showed up just to shoot the scene he already had in his head			2
i 've always respected @entity138 so much more than @entity137 -- i like the idea of having an idea -- but i 'm sure there are @entity138 outtakes			0
@entity138 did n't just risk his life and break his bones -- he also had to work			2
he must have run down some dead ends			0
i understood the idea of work in music , comedy , movies , writing , performance , and certainly juggling and magic , but the fine arts still had that wall of genius separating pure inspiration from work			2
i would see studies and sketches in museums , but even those seemed perfect			0
i thought the fine arts were something else , something different , a pure kind of genius			1
then about five years ago my buddy , entrepreneur and inventor @entity177 , told me he was going to paint his version of @entity180 's " @entity179 " in his warehouse in @entity182			1
@entity177 reckoned that @entity180 did n't just get a perfect photorealistic image in his head and move it to the canvas with a steady handful of talent			1
@entity177 figured that @entity180 had used a machine and a lot of hard work			1
@entity177 was going to recreate a machine like that and with no experience or talent for oil painting , @entity177 was going to try to do his own @entity180			1
this would n't be just four @entity197 sitting around in a room with guitars , drum and a piano serving the muse			0
@entity177 would first have to tear down the wall of his warehouse in @entity205 to put in windows for the proper light , build all the furniture himself to recreate @entity180 's room from the 17th century , grind his own lenses , grind his own 17th century style pigments ( many of which are illegal today because they 're so poisonous ) , mix his own paint and after all that and more , then he could start the backbreaking and mind - numbing work of painting with his machine			1
it would cost him more money and man - hours than all the @entity2 albums put together			1
i told @entity177 we had to document his trying to paint a @entity180 , and i convinced @entity224 to direct a movie that would be @entity177 's bootleg " @entity29 " to @entity180 's perfect " @entity68			1
" i love @entity177 and did n't think i could respect him more than i did before he started this project			1
" @entity233 " did n't diminish my love , respect , enjoyment or awe of @entity180 's paintings			1
i still believe in genius			0
but , for better or worse , all geniuses have to work their asses off			0
there will be an answer , but you ca n't just let it be .			0

@entity242 : as a kid , i thought the @entity2 recorded their songs without a hitch
he says bootleg recordings showed him the mistakes and rigors of creative process
genius does n't mean doing everything right the first time , he says
*jillette* : my *friend* @entity177 showed process in *detail* as he tried to paint a @entity180
