this meant @entity1 was out on his own as powered down the finishing straight , with @entity41 claiming a distant silver medal and the tiny @entity44 nation of @entity45 and @entity46 winning an unexpected bronze medal			2
@entity1 , who was celebrating his second gold in 24 hours after retaining his world 200m title , normally runs the third leg for the @entity4 team , but @entity54 's injury forced him to miss the championships , meaning he was switched to the anchor leg			1

i am proud of my team and i 'm very happy with myself , " added the 25 - year - old , who celebrated in his own unique style by leading his teammates through a series of dance moves in front of a delighted crowd			0
but there was some consolation for the @entity26 sprinters as the women 's squad took gold ahead of @entity4 in the women 's 4x100m relay , with @entity78 taking the bronze medal			1

@entity104 was pushed hard by 2007 champion @entity105 , but he held on to finish 0.28 seconds ahead of the @entity26			2

@entity111 , the reigning world indoor and @entity118 champion , was the favorite coming into the event , and she justified that tag by coming from near the back of the pack at the 600m mark to clinch the gold medal in a time of one minute 55.87 seconds			2
@entity113 took silver with @entity130 's 2007 champion @entity129 claiming bronze			0
