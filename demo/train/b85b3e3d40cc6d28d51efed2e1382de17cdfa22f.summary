we do n't yet know how or why the @entity2 brothers , the alleged @entity3 bombers , decided to carry out their attacks , but a look at how their stories correlate with those of some other terrorists living in the @entity9 could provide some answers to the questions that many are now asking about them			1
how could someone who grew up in the @entity14 , as the younger brother did , become a terrorist ? @entity17 , who killed 13 people at @entity19 in @entity20 in 2009 , was born and raised in @entity21			1
he self - radicalized , in part , over the @entity23 , which he used to reach out to the @entity25 - based preacher @entity24 for advice about whether it is permissible for @entity28 soldiers in the @entity14 military to kill their comrades in the name of jihad			1
@entity24 , a leader of @entity34 's affiliate in @entity25 , was somewhat noncommittal in his responses but did not discourage the act			0
investigators will surely be combing through the e-mail traffic of the @entity2 brothers to see if they either reached out to militant @entity41 clerics or downloaded lectures by such clerics			2
they will also examine the brothers ' internet usage to see if they visited jihadist forums or downloaded propaganda from @entity34 or other allied groups			2
and of course , it 's possible their decision to carry out the attacks was reached without any outside influence			0
@entity55 suspects : immigrant dream to @entity14 nightmare 2			1
how do you square the multiple descriptions of the brothers as " good guys " with the fact that they plotted mass murder ? it 's worth recalling that @entity66 , the leader of the suicide attackers who bombed the @entity69 transit system in 2005 killing 52 commuters , was a beloved teacher at a primary school in the northern city of @entity73 who taught children with developmental problems , and the happily married 30 - year - old father of a baby daughter			2
colleagues and acquaintances described @entity66 as a gentle , kind man			0
no surprise then that we are hearing some similar positive characterizations of the brothers @entity2			2
did the brothers have any training or practice on explosives ? it seems quite unlikely that the perpetrators would have been able to successfully set off two deadly bombs within seconds of each other without some sort of training or practice			2
bomb - making recipes certainly exist on the @entity23 , but actually building effective bombs is generally a skill that requires some training or practice , and even then a successful detonation is not guaranteed			1
@entity103 , for instance , received bomb - making training from the @entity107 @entity106 before he constructed a bomb in an suv that fizzled out rather than blowing up as he intended in @entity110 on may 1 , 2010			0
the older @entity2 brother , @entity111 , spent six months in @entity112 last year			2
what precisely he did there will surely be of intense interest to investigators			0
could he have received some kind of bomb - training from @entity120 militants who are experienced in making explosives ? @entity123 , a @entity124 who had also lived for many years in the @entity14 , plotted to blow up bombs on the @entity128 subway around the eighth anniversary of 9/11			1
@entity123 travelled to @entity107 a year before his planned attacks to learn bomb - making techniques from @entity34 militants			0
was this the kind of model that @entity2 followed ? also , might the @entity2 brothers have done some kind of test runs of their explosive devices in the @entity14 ? opinion : suspects ' culture of migration and machismo 4			1
if the brothers ' motivation had something to do with their @entity120 heritage , how might that have played out in this case ? in the years after 9/11 , dozens of young @entity152 - @entity14 men traveled to fight in the civil war in @entity152			1
just as the @entity2 brothers , these @entity152 - @entity14 were first - generation @entity14			1
for these new @entity14 , the politics of their homeland can sometimes become more meaningful and important than it was for their parents who fled the chaos of their native countries for the safety of the @entity14 , and who now want to put those conflicts behind them			1
what exactly prompted the @entity164 to interview @entity2 in 2011 , following a tip from @entity112 that he was " a follower of radical @entity167 " and was contemplating leaving the @entity14 to join a clandestine organization ? 5			1
did @entity164 officials make a mistake when they questioned @entity111 , but did n't seem to further monitor him ? maybe			0
this is reminiscent of the case of @entity17 whose emails to fellow militants came to the attention of the feds before he killed his fellow soldiers at @entity177 , but were not followed up on			0
@entity178 , a convert to @entity167 , shot up a military recruiting office @entity180 , @entity181 , killing a soldier in 2009			0
@entity183 was also on the radar of the feds before he travelled to @entity25			0
it was only after this trip to @entity25 , where he linked up with an @entity34 affiliate , that @entity183 carried out the shooting at the recruiting office			2
did the brothers intend to die during the attacks or their aftermath ? it seems shocking to many that the @entity2 brothers might have been wearing suicide vests during their gun battle with police on thursday night , but in reality several @entity14 citizens and residents have intended to die in terrorist attacks			1
three of the young @entity152 - @entity14 men who traveled from @entity207 to fight in civil war in @entity152 later carried out suicide attacks there			1
@entity17 undoubtedly went into his attack on a military base full of armed @entity14 soldiers believing that it would be the last thing he did before he died			2
( that prediction did not come true			0
he was wounded in the attack but not killed )			0
the @entity34 recruit @entity123 , who plotted to bomb the @entity128 subway in the summer of 2009 , planned to die in this attack but was arrested before he could pull it off			0
analysis : older suspect grew increasingly religious 7			0
were the brothers really " lone wolves " ? given all the mayhem the two brothers are allegedly responsible for -- two bombings that caused three deaths and some two hundred injuries at the @entity3 as well as the subsequent murder of a policeman at @entity230 -- did they have some kind of additional help ? according to @entity55 law enforcement officials , there is no evidence of such help and it 's worth recalling that @entity17 was entirely a lone wolf who nonetheless managed to kill 13 on a @entity14 military base with heavy security			1
did the older @entity2 radicalize his younger brother ? perhaps			0
where there is some kind of terrorist cell there is sometimes a leader who instigates action			0
we saw this in the case in @entity252 , @entity253 where a group of @entity25 - @entity14 men who trained with @entity34 in @entity256 before 9/11 were radicalized by @entity257 , a @entity25 @entity14 who had spent many years living in @entity258			1
@entity257 encouraged his fellow @entity25 - @entity14 to travel to @entity256 for military training			2
how unusual is it for brothers to carry out terrorist attacks together ? more frequent than you might think			0
the deadliest terrorist attack in @entity14 history on 9/11 involved three pairs of brothers among the 19 hijackers : brothers @entity269 and @entity271 , @entity272 and @entity273 and @entity274 and @entity275 .			1

@entity277 : many *unresolved* questions about how or why brothers carried out bombing
he says experience of other terrorists in the @entity9 could shed some light
some who spent *formative* years in @entity14 were radicalized over the @entity23 , he says
@entity289 : three pairs of brothers were among 19 hijackers on *september* 11
