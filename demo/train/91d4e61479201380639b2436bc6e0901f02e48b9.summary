@entity0 -- @entity3 's tight restrictions on protests and picketing outside military funerals were tossed out by a federal judge monday , over free speech concerns			1
a small @entity9 church had brought suit over its claimed right to loudly march outside the burials and memorial services of those killed in overseas conflicts			2
the state legislature had passed a law to keep members of the @entity19 - based @entity18 from demonstrating within 300 feet of such private services			1
church members , led by pastor @entity22 , believe @entity23 is punishing the @entity24 for " the sin of homosexuality " through events including soldiers ' deaths			1
members have traveled the country , shouting at grieving family members at funerals and displaying such signs as " thank @entity23 for @entity35 , " " @entity23 blew up the @entity36 " and " @entity37			1
" the @entity38 last year had granted a temporary injunction blocking enforcement of the law until it could be challenged			2
the justices will hear a similar challenge this fall involving the same church			2
judge @entity45 in a 19 - page order , dismissed the state legislation			0
the laws , said the @entity56 - based judge , " could have the effect of criminalizing speech the mourners want to hear , including speech from counter-protesters to plaintiffs ' [ the @entity18 's ] message			1
as the law burdens substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government 's interest , [ the law ] violates the free speech clause of the @entity63			1
" @entity68 , his daughter , @entity66 , and other church members had protested near the august 2005 funeral of @entity71 spc. @entity70 in @entity72 , @entity3			1
the married @entity73 died while on patrol in @entity75 , @entity76 , when an improvised explosive device detonated near his @entity79 military vehicle			0
he was 21 , and in addition to his wife , he left behind a daughter			0
he was later buried at @entity85 in @entity9			0
in response to that protest , @entity3 lawmakers passed the " spc. @entity92 , " criminalizing picketing " in front or about " a funeral location or procession			1
@entity66 then went to federal court to ask for a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of the statute until its constitutionality could be reviewed			0
a federal appeals court eventually agreed			0
that court did not address the broader @entity63 claims , but noted the law was overly intrusive , since it " restricts expressive activity not just within or on the premises of a cemetery of a church , but also on traditional public fora such as the adjacent public streets and sidewalks			1
" the @entity38 has never addressed the specific issues of laws designed to protect the " sanctity and dignity of memorial and funeral services , " as well as the privacy of family and friends of the deceased			0
but the justices in october will hear an appeal from the father of a @entity24 solider killed in @entity76 , after members of the @entity18 conducted an angry demonstration at his son 's burial service in @entity126			1
the family of the @entity128 had won a $ 5 million judgment from the protesters , which was overturned by lower federal courts			0
at issue is a balancing test between the privacy rights of grieving families and the free - speech rights of demonstrators , however disturbing and provocative their message			0
several other states besides @entity3 have attempted to impose specific limits on when and where the church members can protest			1
the justices are being asked to address how far states can go to justify picket - free zones and the use of " floating buffers " to silence or restrict the speech or movements of demonstrators exercising their constitutional rights in a funeral setting			0
various jurisdictions across the nation have responded to the protests with varying levels of control over the church protesters			2
according to a legal brief it filed with the @entity38 , church members believe it is their duty to protest and picket at certain events , including funerals , to promote their religious message : " that @entity23 's promise of love and heaven for those who obey him in this life is counterbalanced by @entity23 's wrath and hell for those who do not obey him			1
" the congregation is made up mostly of @entity68 and his family			0
the pastor has 13 children , and at least 54 grandchildren and seven great - grandchildren			0
he described himself as an " old - time " gospel preacher in a @entity1 interview in 2006 , saying , " you ca n't preach the @entity185 without preaching the hatred of @entity23			2
" the church has also protested at least since 1993 at funerals of gay persons , those who died from @entity191 , and others whose lifestyles are deemed sinful but were touted as heroic upon their death			2
@entity3 officials said the appeals court improperly balanced the free speech rights of both sides in favor of the church			1
" mourners can not avoid a message that targets funerals without forgoing their right to partake in funeral or burial services , so are appropriately viewed as a captive audience " that is simply unable to shut out the offensive message , said state attorneys			0
the case is @entity66 v. @entity213 ( 06 - 4156 - cv ) .			0

federal judge tosses out @entity3 *ban* on protests and picketing at military funerals
the law was passed in response to a protest by @entity18
the church members say they believe @entity24 troop deaths are @entity23 's punishment
