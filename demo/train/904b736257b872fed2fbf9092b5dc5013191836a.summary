-- the @entity2 @entity1 has overtaken the @entity3 as the most profitable in the world , according to financial analysts @entity5			1
despite predicting that the @entity3 's revenue will top $ 2.8 billion in the season just gone , @entity5 said clubs ' profitability has more than halved between the 2007 - 08 season and the 2008 - 09 campaign			1
@entity5 's annual review of football finance also showed that the total @entity16 football market grew to a record $ 19.3 billion in 2008 - 09			1
according to @entity18 , a partner in the firm 's @entity19 , the reason the @entity1 has leapfrogged the @entity3 is due to its clubs ' control of wages			1
" the simplest measure to explain why the @entity1 has overtaken the @entity3 is that their clubs exercise more restraint over the wage bill , " he told @entity0			2
" in the @entity3 , the wages to revenue ratio is 67 percent , but it is just 51 percent in the @entity1			2
there are two reasons for this			0
firstly , the licensing of clubs is stricter in @entity2 in terms of the financial regulations they have to adhere to			2
" secondly , rather than being private enterprises under the control of an individual , like @entity43 at @entity44 , clubs are under control of the fans			0
" the clubs ' fans are required to own 50 percent plus one of the shares -- with the exception of @entity52 and @entity53 , who are owned by corporations			0
" are @entity57 clubs worth the investment ? @entity18 said the @entity3 should be " streets ahead " of its @entity2 counterpart in profitability , due to the huge television revenue it receives			1
but @entity5 's figures show that although @entity3 clubs managed to increase their revenue by three percent in 2008 - 09 , operating profits were reduced from $ 267 million in 2007 - 08 to $ 114 million in 2008 - 09			1
this is largely due to increased wage levels , with statistics revealing the $ 70 million increase in @entity3 clubs ' revenue was less than half the $ 190 million increase in wage costs			2
@entity5 believes that trend can not continue , but predicts the @entity3 's new broadcast contracts will drive revenue up to over $ 3 billion in 2010 - 11			1
fans keep football afloat so , why does football seem to be immune to the financial pressures being felt by many industries across the globe ? " football has got an incredible amount of customer loyalty , which helps			0
a lot of clubs have been fairly good at freezing or cutting their prices , " @entity18 said			0
" it is a fairly accepted truth that live sports audiences are about as good as it gets for broadcasters			0
people will get together to watch it , it inspires those water - cooler moments			0
" if you want live sports as a broadcaster then you 're going to want the biggest sport in the world , and if you want the biggest league in the world then you want the @entity3			2
" ' spectacular mismanagement ' as for @entity108 , who became the first club in @entity3 history to sink into administration this season and were subsequently relegated , @entity18 thinks their situation was an anomaly			0
" we see clubs get into difficulty because performance on the pitch is poor , with relegation and the like , but with @entity108 actually performing well and winning an @entity124 , for them to be in this situation it has to be a fairly spectacular case of mismanagement			0
" @entity5 also warned that @entity3 clubs would have make the necessary adjustments to their business plans to meet @entity16 governing body @entity133 's target of becoming " break even " by 2013 - 14 .			1

@entity1 overtakes the @entity3 as world 's most profitable
@entity5 say this is due to the @entity2 clubs ' *tighter* control on wages
@entity3 revenues set to top $ 2.8 billion in season 2010 - 11
figures show @entity16 football market grew to a record $ 19.3 billion in 2008 - 09
