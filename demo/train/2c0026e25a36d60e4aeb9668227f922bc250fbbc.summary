-- in 2000 , i moved to @entity2 for the third and last time with my five grandchildren and husband , jazz musician @entity5			1
their mother had passed on five years before from a heart attack and their father was still distraught			0
we decided to give our grandchildren an international multilingual and multicultural education			1
i had spent 30 years in and out of many @entity15 countries , designing health , education and nutrition programs , and had lived in many places and discovered many cultures			1
we decided on @entity21 , a town in the western part of @entity2			1
the local religious leaders are very tolerant of all religions , creeds , and nationalities			0
after we arrived , our grandchildren started to become accustomed to the varied lifestyle			0
then , my husband , who was my best friend , died			0
i spent my days in prayer , reflection and education of the grandchildren			1
my mourning period had began , and i assumed it would continue all my remaining life			0
in late spring 2001 , @entity37 , a 9 - year - old playmate of my granddaughter , came and asked to join the grandkids home - schooled classes			0
she stated simply that she had failed the third grade the year before , was failing this year , and afraid that she would be thrown out of school			1
in @entity2 , if a child fails two successive years in public school he or she is expelled			1
only if parents can afford private school education will the child be able to continue			1
i explained to her that she was in the @entity2 school system and the grandkids ' classes were not the same			1
in fact , the last thing i wanted was for an outside child to interrupt my mourning rituals			0
but , @entity37 continued to come and ask			0
finally , i took @entity37 to speak with her mother to stop her asking			0
her mother explained that the girl was not intelligent and would probably fail			0
she stated that she would let her finish this school year , then keep her home to teach her how to be a good wife and mother			1
i could not accept that fate for a little girl who only wanted me to assist her			0
i asked her mother to allow me to work with her			0
even though i had not mastered the @entity2 educational system , i thought that with my local contacts i could find someone to help @entity37			1
the next day @entity37 arrived for schooling			1
but she did not come alone			0
she came with three other girls			1
in two weeks , i had 20 little 9 - year - old girls			1
my mourning period was over			0
i researched the whys and wherefores of the little girls ' educational failures			1
i found that of every 60,000 girls who enter first grade , only 4,500 finish primary school in the region of @entity21			1
of those 4,500 students entering middle school , only 1,500 will enter high school			1
five hundred will graduate with a high school diploma , 150 will enter university , and 15 will receive their university degree			2
i discovered that many girls do not have books and school supplies , or the time or a place to study after school			1
i began haunting all the public and private development agencies , local and national government institutions , asking for assistance to support our little girls			2
we were not part of an established program or in the wrong area , or we were turned down for innumerable other reasons			2
there is always someone who knows something that another does not			0
we made sure that everyone knew the basics : read , write , cipher			0
i drew upon competency based educational techniques i had learned at @entity118			0
we had to rely on ourselves			0
in the fall of 2001 the girls wanted me to continue the program			1
i informed them that i had n't been able to find the money			0
they said they could raise their own money			0
they had seen @entity128 girls on television selling cookies and would imitate them			2
so i began " cookie classes			0
" the girls sold cookies and fruit punch			2
they raised enough to buy their school books and supplies			2
the little girls brought in older siblings and relatives who had already failed and been expelled from school			1
the older girls did the cooking and selling			2
they became our financial support and grew into our entrepreneurs			0
the little girls returned to school			1
i knew that in order for them not to fail again , they had to keep learning			0
we involved our girls ' parents to make sure they allowed them the time to study after school by reducing household chores			1
we involved the community by getting it to allocate public spaces and buildings to hold our afterschool classes and programs			0
eventually we got public and private financial and technical support to expand the number of girls that we teach each year			2
we now have 3,383 girls and want to increase our numbers to 5,000 this year			2
we export five blended hibiscus teas , dolls and household products to pay for the schooling			2
we have decided to become green , with an aggressive environmental education and agricultural development entrepreneurial program			1
we have 20 girls in university			2
all failing , all willing to teach and learn			2
and now : all succeeding			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			1

@entity178 left retirement to take on *challenge* of educating girls in @entity2
she says the vast *majority* of schooling is devoted to boys
girls who are expelled from school for failing tests face very limited choices
@entity195 *'s* education program now serves more than 3,000 girls
