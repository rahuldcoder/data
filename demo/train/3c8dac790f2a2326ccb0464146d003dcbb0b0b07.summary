@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 , the @entity6 convicted in december 2009 of the sexual assault and murder of her @entity10 roommate in @entity1 , is " cautiously optimistic " as she begins the lengthy appellate process in @entity0 , @entity1 , her best friend @entity3 said on saturday			1
two forensic experts from @entity14 's @entity13 were sworn in saturday by @entity1 judge @entity15 , taking an oath to uphold objectivity as they retest crucial forensic evidence used to convict @entity19 , 23 , and her former boyfriend @entity20 , of killing @entity22 in @entity0			1
the experts ' work begins on february 9 and they must conclude their analysis by may 9			0
results will be presented to the two - judge and six layperson jury on may 21			0
@entity29 and @entity30 , both professors of forensic science at @entity13 in @entity14 , will test the validity of the forensic results of two controversial forensic exhibits from @entity19 's trial			1
the first is a knife found in @entity20 's apartment with @entity19 's dna on the handle and what @entity0 prosecutors say is @entity43 's dna in a tiny groove on the blade			1
the prosecution contends that the knife was used to stab @entity43 in the neck and that it had been cleaned and the @entity39 matter attributed to @entity43 consists of flesh , not blood			0
the sample , however , was so small that forensic scientists investigating @entity43 's murder were not able to double test it in accordance with international forensic science norms , which @entity19 's legal team says raises doubts about its validity			1
@entity30 asked the @entity0 judge if he and his colleague could disassemble the knife , removing the handle from the blade , to see if there is other forensic evidence that has not been tested			2
judge @entity15 reserved the right to pass judgement on that decision until a later date , telling @entity30 that she could petition the court for permission to take the knife apart if necessary			0
the second piece of evidence the forensic experts will test is the tiny metal clasp from @entity43 's bra , which was cut from her body after her murder			1
forensic scientists in the investigatory phase determined that @entity20 's dna is present on the metal clasp			1
the clasp was identified on an investigatory video tape on november 2 , 2007 , when @entity43 's body was found			2
but the clasp was not collected until nearly six weeks later , giving the defense cause to question whether the sample may have been contaminated			0
@entity20 's dna was also found on a cigarette butt in the house where @entity43 was murdered , but nowhere else			2
@entity94 ruled that testimony from several key witnesses could be heard during the lengthy appellate process			0
on march 12 and 26 , the court will hear testimony from @entity100 , a homeless man who testified during the criminal trial that he saw @entity19 and @entity20 near the crime scene the night of the murder			1
@entity100 , who is also facing trial on separate drug charges , said during the initial criminal trial that the same night he saw @entity19 and @entity20 he also saw student revelers waiting for shuttle buses headed to @entity0 's discotheques			1
judge @entity15 granted the defense 's request to hear testimony from both the bus drivers and disco owners , who will testify that the discos were closed the night @entity43 was murdered because of the religious @entity118 's holiday			0
@entity15 has not yet ruled on whether to hear testimony from @entity22 , the third man convicted of @entity43 's murder			0
@entity122 chose a fast - track trial and was convicted in october 28 , 2008 and sentenced to 30 years for his part in @entity43 's murder			2
his sentence was reduced to 16 years on appeal in december 2009 and then upheld by @entity1 's high court of appeal in december 2010			2
@entity1 's high court ruled that @entity122 acted as one of three conspirators in @entity43 's murder			0
@entity15 has granted the prosecution the right to have the appellate court consider the high court ruling in @entity19 's and @entity20 's current appeal			1
@entity19 's stepfather @entity136 told reporters in @entity0 saturday that @entity19 is hopeful that the appellate judge will overturn her conviction and send her home			1
" she 's doing well and is happy it 's going her way , " he told reporters in the courtroom			0
" but she is also apprehensive			0
" the court is not expected to make a final ruling on the appeal until next summer .			0

2 forensic experts will retest a knife and bra clasp from @entity5 trial for dna evidence
retesting is part of @entity19 's appeal of 2009 murder conviction
@entity19 's stepfather says " she 's doing well and is happy it 's going her way "
