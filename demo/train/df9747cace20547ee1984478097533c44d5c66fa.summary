-- for most people a trip across @entity2 is a chance to see the sights and sample the continent 's cuisine			0
unless , like @entity9 , they 've got their head buried in a trash can			1
the @entity12 , who celebrates his 26th birthday this month , has spent the last 10 weeks dumpster diving -- eating only discarded food -- from @entity12 to @entity16 on a mission to highlight the issue of food waste			1
" i did n't really believe i would succeed , " @entity9 told @entity0 by phone from @entity21 shortly after completing his 3,000 - kilometer ( 1,900 miles ) journey by bicycle			1
" i thought i would probably starve for four or five days and then i would have to buy something			0
" instead , @entity9 was surprised at the abundance of discarded produce he was able to scavenge from supermarkets , bakeries and restaurants			1
he was easily able to fuel himself on his epic trek through @entity31 , @entity32 , the @entity33 , @entity34 and the @entity35			1
along the way , the former fast food worker has learned valuable lessons about the trash habits of the different @entity2 nations he visited			1
rooting through refuse " i 'm trying to protest against the huge waste of food			1
it 's completely absurd and pointless , " says @entity9 , who planned his trip to coincide with the @entity46 's declared " @entity45			1
" " we 're wasting really good resources -- there 's so much water , energy and pollution involved in creating something that ends up in the trash			2
and there are millions of people starving			0
" sticking to a strict rule of only eating food that had been thrown out or was destined for the trash , @entity9 asked the permission of supermarket and restaurant staff before rooting through their refuse			1
occasionally he climbed fences to access dumpsters			0
people in some countries were more understanding than others , he says			0
" in the @entity35 , it was quite difficult , " he says			1
" people did n't really understand what the project was -- they thought i was homeless , they did n't really understand the foreigner who asked for food from the trash and all the supermarkets had it quite well locked up			2
" i went for days eating mainly just bread			2
" @entity34 , he says , was the easiest country for dumpster diving , not because there was more food waste , but because people were more receptive to his mission			1
" i think all the countries ' waste is about the same			2
the supermarkets in all countries work in a similar way : the fruit and vegetables must look perfect and the ones that do n't go in the trash			0
" in @entity34 , a lot of people were supportive of the project -- sometimes at supermarkets , my request would be asked of the boss and the boss would say no. but then a guy would come back and say , ' i 'm really sorry my boss says no , but wait , my boss is a jerk , so come back later and i will get you something			2
" right place , right time @entity31 , too , is a land of plenty for dumpster divers , according to @entity9 , something he puts down to its relative wealth and relaxed rules on food disposal			1
as part of his mission , the sustainable development graduate also visited schools to explain his mission to students -- and at the same time chow down on leftovers from the school cafeteria			0
while he admits growing weary of a diet of stale bread and raw vegetables , there were some culinary highlights -- particularly during his darkest days in the @entity35			2
" i arrived at a vegan restaurant in @entity134 where they were so busy they were turning people away , " he recalls			0
" i explained what i was doing to the waiter and he came back minutes later with this beautifully designed plate of food and said ' do you want this ? ' " it was the wrong order for the customer and they were going to throw it away			0
i was starving and i arrived at the right place at the right time			0
" other highlights included a jar of honey and dried apricots found in @entity34 , some tinned goods from @entity31 and a box of 12 eggs -- consigned to the garbage can because just one was broken			1
" i was always happy when i had cakes and sweet things because they do n't need cooking and when you 're on a bicycle , you need the energy , " he adds			0
@entity9 says he hopes in the future to work with supermarkets and restaurants to find ways of reducing waste			1
he does n't rule out further dumpster diving missions			0
" why not ? although when you 're eating absolutely nothing that does n't come from the trash , you go a long time without eating what you want			2
" and it 's a very long time to go without drinking a single beer			0
" you can follow @entity178 's ongoing project at @entity179 .			0

@entity9 traveled from @entity12 to @entity16 eating food only found in trash cans
the @entity12 says @entity34 was the easiest country in which to find food , the @entity35 the *trickiest*
