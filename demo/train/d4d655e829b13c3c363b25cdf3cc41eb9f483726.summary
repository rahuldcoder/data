@entity0 -- for months , voters have been in the dark about key details of @entity6 's tax plans			1
he specified $ 5 trillion in tax cuts , a 20 % cut in income tax rates , a 40 % cut in the corporate tax rate , repeal of the estate tax and alternative minimum tax and elimination of taxes on interest , dividends and capital gains for households with incomes below $ 200,000			1
he did not want his changes to raise the deficit , but he was utterly mum on how to raise $ 5 trillion to offset the tax cuts			1
during the summer , two colleagues and i showed that if @entity6 did not want to add new taxes on savings and investments -- and raising savings and investments is the second of four main planks in @entity6 's overall economic package -- he could not finance his tax cuts without generating a net tax cut for households with income above $ 200,000			1
politics : 5 things we learned from the presidential debate even if all the available tax expenditures were closed in the most progressive manner possible , it would not raise enough revenue among high - income households to offset the tax cuts they would receive			1
this was true even when we adjusted the revenue estimates to allow for the impact of potential economic growth , and even when we gave the campaign a trillion - dollar mulligan by ignoring the cost of the corporate tax cuts			1
as a result , we concluded that if @entity6 did not impose new taxes on savings and investments , the only way to finance his tax cut proposals and reach revenue neutrality was to raise taxes on households with income below $ 200,000			1
this was not a forecast of what @entity6 would actually do ; it was simply a matter of arithmetic			0
but it highlighted the need for specifics ; $ 5 trillion is not a trivial amount , even in @entity0 , and the prospect of middle - class tax increases sets off alarm bells			1
earlier this week , @entity6 finally started the process of proposing ways to pay for his tax cut proposals			1
he broached the idea of putting a cap on each taxpayer 's total amount of itemized deductions -- including mortgage interest , state and local taxes , charitable contributions			1
although critical design features remain foggy , @entity6 has said the cap could range from $ 17,000 to $ 50,000 , and it could vary with income			2
several things are already clear			0
opinion : why you should vote for @entity6 first , capping -- or even eliminating -- itemized deductions will not come close to paying for @entity6 's tax cuts			1
it would be a step toward financing , but much more will be needed			0
nevertheless , as a piece of the revenue puzzle , a cap is an interesting and important idea and a welcome step forward			2
members of @entity108 are quick to see the political advantages of a cap			0
relative to curtailing specific deductions , a cap allows them to leave existing deductions in place but restrict the overall use of such deductions			0
in that sense , the cap is like the alternative minimum tax was intended to be -- a limit on the overall use of tax shelters , even if political leaders could not shut down each one			0
a cap on itemized deductions goes after one of the three areas of the income tax where the money is			2
the other two are the exclusion of health insurance premiums from taxation and saving and investment incentives like 401 ( k ) plans , and the lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends and carried interest			0
a cap on a taxpayer 's use of all of these subsidies -- as opposed to just itemized deductions -- could get at all three areas			2
@entity148 of @entity149 and the @entity6 campaign and @entity151 of the @entity152 have proposed a different style of cap that applies to more than just itemized deductions			2
while @entity6 's cap appears to apply to all itemized deductions , it may have a disproportionately negative effect on charitable contributions			1
after all , people have to pay their state and local taxes , and many people are already in the middle of a long - term commitment to pay down their mortgage			0
opinion : @entity6 shakes up the race for those households , there may be little room left under the cap to take deductions for charitable contributions			2
and , for all households , the cap would eliminate tax deductions for contributions larger than the cap , so large gifts to charities would automatically lose their tax - preferred status			2
so , a cap is not a panacea , but it could well be one part of a constructive solution			0
likewise , his acknowledgment that his earlier , disparaging comments about the 47 % of households that do not pay federal income taxes were misguided suggests a reconsideration of the role taxes play in those households			0
if the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step , @entity6 has finally taken the first step			0
but there is still much more work to be done			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			0

@entity201 : @entity6 's $ 5 trillion tax cut proposal did **n't** add up for months
he says new idea of a cap on deductions is a first step toward a viable plan
@entity201 says the cap would **n't** be nearly enough to pay for the tax cuts , but it would help
he says that it could make taxpayers much less likely to give to charity
