-- there ca n't be many people whose image has sat @entity4 on a front page with @entity6 , the now expired former dictator of @entity7			0
but @entity8 , the president of soccer 's governing body @entity9 , is one of the few to hold this dubious honor			1
it was june 2011 , and @entity14 -- a @entity15 tabloid newspaper owned by @entity16 and known for its cheeky , salacious front pages -- ran one of its most memorable headlines			0
" despot the difference , " it screamed above a picture of @entity8 and @entity6			1
" two deluded dictators continued to cling on to power yesterday as their corrupt regimes crumbled around them			0
" the ire directed at @entity6 was obvious			0
@entity27 ? soccer 's administrator in chief had become one of the most hated men in @entity15			2
blog : time for football to tackle racism epidemic ? a series of corruption scandals within @entity9 , his botched re-election campaign -- where his only opponent was barred from standing after another corruption scandal -- and the failure of @entity44 's bid to host the 2018 @entity45 to attract any interest in @entity9 's corridors of power ( despite having the best technical report ) led to an outpouring of incredulity			1
@entity8 was deemed arrogant and elusive			1
he became public enemy number two , after @entity6			0
just over 18 months on and @entity8 has fared slightly better than @entity6			1
this weekend he was vilified again for refusing to back the principle of @entity54 walking off the pitch when one of the @entity59 club 's black players was racially abused by fans			1
it was seized as another example of @entity8 's buffoonery and came after comments he made in a 2011 interview with @entity0 when he seemed to suggest there was no problem with racism in soccer , at least on the pitch			1
but is this foolishness , myopia or inelegance ? i would say the latter of the three			0
his comments on the @entity54 incident were broadly correct			1
whilst @entity81 should be applauded for his " @entity83 " moment , enshrining it in law would be highly problematic			1
as @entity87 in the @entity15 newspaper @entity86 wrote this week in a piece criticizing @entity89 for its weakness on tackling racism : " @entity81 has issued a significant threat , not just of uncomplicated outrage by black players , but situations which would create incentives for all kinds of connivance in the abandonment of vital matches in which one side had taken what looked like an impregnable advantage			1
" that soccer 's governing bodies contributed to the situation by handing out paltry fines for previous transgressions is true too			1
sure , @entity9 is not without its problems , but the sound bites tend to obscure a much wider , more important truth : @entity8 's largely positive influence on the game , especially in the developing world			1
whilst he is parodied as an out of touch buffoon haphazardly directing affairs from @entity9 's " @entity118 " in @entity119 , he has arguably done more in the modern era to spread the game globally than anyone else			1
this year i interviewed @entity8 twice			1
on both occasions he talked about soccer being more than just a game			0
that it was also an agent of social change			0
his first act when elected president in 1998 was to fly into the @entity130 and welcome @entity131 to the soccer family			2
it allowed the @entity134 to organize their own league , push for movement restrictions in the @entity137 to be lifted , to build their own national football stadium , start a women 's professional league and , in 2011 , host their very first @entity45 qualifier against @entity142			2
sure , the @entity142 government were not happy , but the team traveled and played in the @entity137 , the first time a team from @entity142 had done so			0
it was defacto recognition of both sides of this seemingly intractable conflict			0
@entity9 became one of a tiny handful of international organizations to recognize the existence of @entity131 , a full four years before a @entity155 vote almost , but not quite , got to the same point			1
the @entity134 have cleverly used soccer as a way of both flying their flag and as a dry run for building and maintaining important civic institutions			2
@entity8 should take credit for kickstarting that movement			2
the wider point here is that @entity8 's tenure as @entity9 president has been internationalist in tooth and claw			1
under his watch the @entity45 was hosted in @entity170 for the first time in 2002			0
it is a region that , in 50 years ' time , will undoubtedly be the new power center of the world game			2
@entity8 championed @entity174 's first ever @entity45 , in @entity174 in 2010 , a remarkable vote of confidence in a country barely two decades out of apartheid			1
and , most controversially , @entity179 and then the @entity180 will host their first @entity181 in 2018 and 2022 respectively			0
no one should have been surprised by either move			0
both regions are booming and have a deep love of the game			0
@entity9 under @entity8 has been aggressively expansionist and hosting a @entity45 in @entity44 or even the @entity188 would have added little new			1
soccer is , now more than ever , a global game and deserves to be shared across the world			0
@entity192 may now be the most successful region both in terms of money and success on the pitch but the balance of power is shifting , to @entity198 , @entity170 , the @entity180 and the new @entity192			0
@entity8 recognized that shift and helped to drive it			2
given that context it would be absurd to now think that the 76 - year - old was someone unconcerned with the issues of racism			0
now there are a new set of pressing challenges			0
the rise in racism needs to be tackled with financial penalties so stiff that clubs would have no choice but to take the issue seriously			0
greater transparency within @entity9 's decision making and finances need to be addressed			1
the corruption watchdog @entity218 cut its ties with @entity9 in 2011 when two of its recommendations -- that the investigator charged with overseeing @entity9 would be compromised if he was paid by @entity9 and that he should be allowed to investigate old corruption scandals -- were dropped			2
the stain of corruption emanating from countries with poor records in transparency and openness is another issue			0
why not publish the salaries and expenses of @entity9 's leading members to combat that ? but , when his tenure is up , the same question will be asked			1
will @entity8 leave the game in a better place than he found it ? the game has been spread further and deeper than ever before			2
there is much that still needs reforming in @entity9			2
but in @entity174 , @entity170 and the @entity180 he 'll be rightly feted for seriously taking the game to the world , no matter what the headline writers think .			0

@entity8 has been criticized for saying players can not " run away " from racism
@entity9 president 's comments came after @entity81 walked off pitch in *protest*
@entity256 international was playing for @entity54 in a *friendly* against fourth division @entity258
@entity8 has been president of world football 's governing body since 1998
