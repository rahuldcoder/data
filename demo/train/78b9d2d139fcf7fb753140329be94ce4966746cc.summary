the world 's strangest looking airplane is celebrating the 20th anniversary of its first flight this month			0
popularly known as the " @entity5 , " because of its resemblance to the white @entity9 whale , the @entity5 ( @entity10 stands for @entity5 ) is unique not only in appearance , but also for the essential role it performs in @entity15 aviation			2
today , more than 60 flights are performed each week between 11 sites , carrying parts for all of the @entity5 programs			2
so what 's so special about this odd - looking aircraft ? here 's an in - depth look at the @entity5			1
from guppies to belugas @entity5 ' production centers are scattered all over the continent , a legacy of its origins as a pan-european consortium			2
each factory specializes in the completion of a specific section of an aircraft			0
the five @entity34 , all operated by @entity5 , link these plants and take the different aircraft sections to the final assembly line , either in @entity39 or @entity40			1
until the mid- 1990s , @entity5 used another funny - looking aircraft to perform its big transporting jobs -- the " @entity46 , " a derivative of the @entity43 , a military cargo version of the 1940s @entity45			1
the @entity46 was already outdated by the time @entity5 started using it			2
worse was the fact that @entity5 was relying on a couple of old aircraft from its chief rival , @entity53 , to handle the bulk of its logistics chain			1
if it was to keep up with its frantic growth , @entity5 concluded it needed something better			2
the airframe chosen for the job was taken from the @entity5 - 600 , an aircraft that already had a successful track record with airlines such as @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			1
each of the five belugas in operation are , actually , @entity5 - 600 jets that have been modified to carry large cargo			2
the top section of the aircraft was cut and an additional , wider fuselage section -- resembling a bubble -- was added to the airframe , giving it its characteristic hump			0
the cockpit was lowered , making it possible for the cargo hold to be loaded and unloaded through the front of the aircraft			0
the result is an incredibly spacious cargo hold			0
although the @entity5 's maximum payload of 47 tons is surpassed by a handful of other cargo aircraft , its voluminous hold makes it suitable for transporting oversized , but not particularly heavy , cargo			1
the @entity5 can carry the wings of an @entity94 airliner or a fuselage section for @entity5 ' newest wide - body aircraft , the @entity97			1
but it 's not large enough to transport many @entity100 super jumbo parts			0
those need to travel by boat , barge and road			0
belugas have occasionally been chartered to fly satellites , helicopters and even works of art. @entity115 's " @entity114 " flew from @entity110 to @entity111 on a @entity5 -- the canvas would n't fit into any other plane			1
coming up : @entity116 with the @entity5 hitting two decades of indefatigable service , it 's starting to show its age and limitations			1
since the @entity5 's maiden flight on september 13 , 1994 , @entity5 has multiplied aircraft deliveries by nearly five			1
the company has become more global , diversifying its supplier base and opening assembly plants in @entity126 and @entity127 -- well outside the @entity5 's relatively short range of 1,500 nautical miles with maximum payload			1
in order to cope with the increasing workload , @entity5 has put in place the so - called " @entity133 " program			0
the program aims to optimize the company 's logistics infrastructure by increasing the work performed by its transport fleet to 10,000 hours per year by 2017			0
the plan includes the @entity5			0
@entity5 says the @entity5 's flight hours per aircraft have doubled since it first went into service and will do so again by 2017 , from 5,000 to 10,000 flight hours , due to the production start of the @entity97 in 2012 and the production ramp - up on other @entity5 programs			1
with aircraft order books at a historic maximum , however , @entity5 ca n't afford to bet its vital logistics operation chain on the readiness of five aging aircraft			1
though no decisions have been made , @entity5 is reportedly looking at potential replacement solutions			1
tentatively called @entity116 , the @entity5 's replacement is likely to be based on the @entity156 airframe			1
it 's expected to have a longer range and be able to carry a heavier payload , while still being able to land at airports with relatively short runways , such as the one in @entity161 , @entity162 , where @entity5 makes wings for its airliners			2
the next generation @entity5 should also make it possible for @entity5 to double its number of cargo flights to 120 per week			0
what seems assured is that the @entity116 is going to look similar to the current version , something plane spotters passing through @entity39 should appreciate			0

the @entity5 -- better known as the @entity5 -- took its maiden flight on september 13 , 1994
the @entity5 was designed to *end* @entity5 ' reliance on the @entity184
@entity5 ' five @entity34 are made to transport huge items , such as aircraft wings
@entity5 may be looking at a potential " @entity116 " replacement
