-- @entity1 ' good , @entity2			1
in a brief new commercial , @entity3 comes across as more polished than the disheveled pitchman he was a few months ago			1
his hair is nicely tousled , his slim - fit shirt hugs his torso , and he has a fashionable touch of facial stubble			2
ok , it 's hard to tell whether he 's wearing a belt , but that 's because his shirt is untucked			2
the new look is a response to the complaints -- some wry , some serious -- the company got after an earlier series of ads featuring @entity3			1
as one person on @entity29 wrote , " i had no idea # @entity22 was a thing , but i do know that my wife and i both wondered why homeless people were doing travel ads. " some people even dressed up as him for @entity32 , perhaps as a way to frighten children ( or , more likely , @entity35 )			2
does ' @entity36 ' need a makeover ? @entity2 was n't going to let that slide			1
" @entity39 was listening ! " the company trumpeted in a news release			2
the company sponsored a contest to give @entity3 a style makeover			1
the winner was @entity46 , an @entity47 - based style consultant ( @entity48 ) who not only got to reshape @entity3 ' image , he received a five - day trip to @entity51 to watch the new spot get shot			1
( hey , @entity39 is a travel website			0
) opinions on @entity29 were mostly favorable ... " someone @ @ trivago was listening - the # trivagoguy got a # makeover			1
better fitting shirt in a flattering color			0
the scruff looks intentional , " wrote @entity60			0
... though there was the matter of the beard			0
" hey , the creepy @entity65 got a new shirt & a haircut ! still , would it kill him to shave ? @ @entity72 # travel , " wrote @entity68			0
@entity3 has enjoyed the notoriety the campaign has brought			1
( @entity77 , the reason for the disheveled style was because he had to maintain a look he had on a @entity80 soap opera			2
) but do n't push him to put on a belt			0
" i had a belt on at one point , and it just did n't kind of go with the outfit and we scrapped the belt , " he told @entity0 in august			0
" it 's probably one of the best decisions we ever came up with , because look what it 's created			0
" @entity0 's @entity92 contributed to this story .			0
