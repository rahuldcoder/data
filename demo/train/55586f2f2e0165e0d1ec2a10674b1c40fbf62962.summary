she looks every inch a bond girl , reclining in the @entity5 shallows , the breakwater washing over her bronzed body as she runs her fingers through her long , lustrous tawny locks			2
slim , toned with rock - hard abs , she has a physique that 007 himself would probably kill for			2
" it 's important to accept your body for what @entity25 gave you , " the star of the @entity15 women 's soccer team @entity16 tells @entity1 in a phone interview , as she talks about her career -- and the importance of being comfortable in your own skin , whatever shape you are			1
football 's answer to @entity29 , the 25 - year - old @entity16 has posed for @entity31 's @entity30			1
the publication 's annual homage to scantily - clad women divides opinion , with critics arguing it serves only to objectify the female athletes who occasionally feature on its pages			1
away from the camera lens , the pacey striker 's achievements have propelled her to the summit of women 's football			1
@entity16 has half a century of goals for her country and already has an olympic gold medal in her back pocket			1
those years of grafting to build a career and sculpt a seemingly flawless form led to the @entity31 photo shoots			2
" i certainly do n't feel like i have the perfect body type ... it 's through your own eyes , " says the @entity58 native			2
" and for every female , you 're going to see flaws in that , you 're going to see flaws regardless			0
" so for me it 's just important to have that confidence and self - esteem no matter what body type you have			1
i guess that 's why i did @entity31			1
" not that @entity16 is a natural exhibitionist			2
her willingness to disrobe is born of a confidence cultivated by sporting excellence and she readily admits to having hang ups about her body just like any other woman -- " no matter if i have bigger legs than upper body , " as she puts it			2
" the reason i 'm given these opportunities is because of my talents on the field and i expect myself to continue to improve and show people exactly what i have to offer			0
" she 's fully aware that her pictures might serve as titillation for an audience less concerned with her footballing prowess , but @entity16 argues the @entity31 swimsuit issues are a powerful platform to get @entity15 women 's football into the nation 's mindset			1
" i think there 's a certain degree which guys like to buy the issue for themselves , " admits @entity16			1
" but , from my point of view , i 'm doing this for myself			0
i 'm doing this for the sport and for young girls to see the confidence that i am showing and that i am expressing			2
" @entity16 is all too aware that , for women , objectification is an everyday occurrence			2
" being objectified , for a female , is going to happen no matter if you 're posing for a magazine or walking down the street , that 's just going to happen in every female 's life , " she argues			0
" what i wanted to do was to express my confidence and be proud of the hard work i put in on the field to have the body that i have			1
" engendering that confidence in younger women was also part of the motivation for " @entity128 " -- a series of books authored by @entity16 about a young girl 's experiences on a soccer team			1
released in 2013 , the first novel " saving the team " debuted at no. 7 on the @entity137 literature , while @entity138 is said to have ordered a pilot for a small screen adaptation of the series			0
" there 's not a lot of young , female athlete books out there , aimed just towards girls , " says @entity16 , who once described herself as " never a great writer , " before adding : " for me , that 's why it was so successful			1
" the commitment i had for soccer was just ridiculous			0
a ridiculous passion that no one shared with me			0
it 's really great to be able to talk to young girls now and have them feel so proud of what they 're doing and so confident from a simple book like ' the kicks			1
' " however , @entity16 's debut at the @entity162 four years ago did n't quite have the happy ending the forward was after			1
@entity164 were the @entity15 team 's opponents in a nail - biting final in @entity168 , @entity169			2
the match finished 2 - 2 after extra-time , with @entity16 opening the scoring in the 69th minute , and went to a penalty shootout			1
it was @entity164 who earned an emotional victory , just four months after the country had been devastated by a tsunami that killed over 15,000 people			0
ahead of this year 's tournament in @entity181 , @entity16 is confident the @entity15 can go one step further this time around			1
" the last @entity162 was my first and it was heart - breaking , " she admits			0
" losing to @entity164 on penalties , feeling like we were deserving and they were just as deserving			0
" we had two @entity162 championship teams fighting for one spot and that was really hard			0
" we feel really confident			0
we have the potential to be the best team in the world and we have great players			0
" asked if the @entity15 team will ultimately lift the trophy , @entity16 's response is succinct			1
" let 's talk in july			0
" it 's often said that the harder you work the luckier you get , which brings us to the question of just why @entity16 wears the no. 13 shirt for the @entity205 ? " me and my sister ... we never really understood the unluckiness of the number 13 , " laughs @entity16			1
" we would go to hotels and we would go on vacations with our family and there was never a floor 13			0
we thought that was the strangest thing			0
" we always told ourselves that when we got old and rich we would have a hotel called " the lucky 13 " and all of the floors would be 13a , 13b , 13c ... it was something that we joked about , just the ridiculousness of people thinking a simple number was unlucky			0
" and serendipity came knocking when @entity16 started her club career and it was the only number available to her			2
" so i thought ' i 'm going to take it ! ' i 've never seen any unluckiness in this number and it 's done great things for me			0
" opinion : why no swimsuit edition for men ?			0

@entity16 is the star striker of the @entity205 , scoring 50 goals for her country so far
the 25 - year - old has twice modeled for @entity31 's @entity30
@entity16 is proud of the body she has worked for and hopes to *inspire* confidence in younger girls
