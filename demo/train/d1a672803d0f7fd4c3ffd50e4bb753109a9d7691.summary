@entity1 , @entity0 -- the modern @entity4 movement began on february 27 , 2009 , when small groups in 22 @entity7 cities gathered to protest the signing of president @entity10 's stimulus bill			1
the @entity4 groups viewed the stimulus bill as the crowning moment of decades of irresponsible government fiscal behavior			1
the federal government is addicted to spending , and the consequences are now staring us in the face			1
our national debt is at emergency levels and growing rapidly			2
@entity23 head @entity22 recently said the nation 's fiscal path is simply " unsustainable			2
" and yet this financial crisis seems obvious to virtually everyone except our elected officials in @entity29			0
@entity4 members are not averse to paying taxes			1
however , taxpayers are stretched thin , and piling more taxes on their backs is not the answer			0
we do not understand nor approve of @entity29 's insatiable appetite for spending , because that 's not the way we as individuals live			0
we do not massively overspend today and borrow money tomorrow to cover the bills			0
as @entity45 and @entity46 are learning , that ride eventually comes to an end			0
this week , @entity49 chairman @entity48 said , " to avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits , the nation will ultimately have to choose among higher taxes , modifications to entitlement programs such as @entity55 and @entity56 , less spending on everything else from education to defense , or some combination of the above			0
" the @entity4 endorses massive reductions of federal spending before any consideration of new taxes is brought to the table			1
@entity4 members clearly understand @entity48 's warning			1
if something drastic is not done soon , our entire financial system and way of life will collapse			0
the @entity4 's goal from inception has been to replace big - spending politicians from both political parties with common - sense , fiscally responsible leaders			1
@entity7 has moved away from the vision of our @entity80 who advocated for a nuanced balance between federal and state power			0
as @entity7 has drifted from constitutional values , federal power has grown			0
we have gone from a nation of self - sufficient producers to a nation divided between overburdened taxpaying producers and some nonproducers who exist on welfare from cradle to grave			1
so what would the @entity4 movement recommend to set @entity7 on its rightful course ? federal spending must immediately be drastically slashed across the board : abolish the useless departments of @entity100 , among others ; get rid of the @entity102 ; and repeal the stimulus bill and other pork spending			1
these are millstones around the neck of the @entity7 taxpayer and our economy			0
send all responsibilities of these agencies back to the states where they can be better and more efficiently managed			0
foreign aid and @entity116 spending must be equally constrained and reduced			0
second , the number of government jobs must be substantially cut , and those employees must return to the private sector			1
overpaid bureaucrats with fat benefits and pensions not found in the real world are simply not needed			2
third , fraud and welfare waste must be eliminated			2
welfare and unemployment benefits must be drastically cut			1
welfare , health and education services for illegal immigrants must be eliminated			2
the @entity134 recently reported that 33 percent of immigrant households use some kind of " welfare			2
" again , who pays ? the @entity7 taxpayer ! government must get completely out of the private sector			1
market freedoms must prevail for @entity7 to be successful			0
government control over our financial and insurance industries , major manufacturing , health care and energy is a sure recipe for disaster			2
@entity29 bureaucrats are simply incapable of efficiency			0
the @entity4 is determined to send new , fiscally responsible leaders to @entity29 to trim government fat -- and not with scalpels , but with chainsaws			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			1

@entity159 : @entity161 and *agriculture* departments , the @entity102 , the stimulus bill
@entity159 : government jobs must be substantially cut ; employees sent to the private sector
@entity4 wants welfare and unemployment benefits drastically cut , he says
take a chainsaw to government , get it out of the private sector , @entity159 writes
