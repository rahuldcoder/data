@entity0 -- despite a hardline @entity4 policy , there is no reason why federal officials ca n't negotiate directly with pirates who are holding a @entity4 captain hostage off @entity9 , a counterterrorism expert said thursday			1
pirates have been plaguing commercial shipping vessels in the waters off the coast of @entity15			0
nor is there anything to stop an independent party from paying for his release , said @entity21 , who served as deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism under former president @entity24			1
" the @entity4 has a very clear policy of no concessions ; that 's different than no negotiations , " said @entity21 , now is a senior adviser to the @entity26 in @entity0			1
the @entity4 policy against concessions translates into a policy against paying for the release of hostages , he said			1
" that means no ransoms , nothing of value in return for the safe release of hostages , " he said			0
but , he added , " it 's also important to note that there 's nothing in @entity4 policy that restricts family members or private companies -- like a shipping company -- to actually pay a ransom			1
there 's nothing that the @entity4 government can do other than potentially to prosecute if that money is going to a known terrorist organization , which is a fine line			1
" nevertheless , he said it is @entity4 government policy to discourage private companies from making payments to hostage takers			2
" the @entity4 has a very clear sense that , if you start to pay ransoms , you in essence create an industry for kidnapping , " he said			2
" and , frankly , it 's why you see an uptick in the piracy problem in @entity15			2
it 's a for - profit venture			0
it 's very lucrative at low cost for the pirates and it 's , in part , fueled by the fact that shipping companies in other countries have been paying ransoms for the release of ships , cargo and personnel			2
" @entity21 predicted the standoff off @entity9 will not be resolved soon			1
" i do n't see or forecast the use of massive force inadvertently because of the potential for hurting our citizen , " he said , referring to @entity86 , the captain of the @entity87 who was taken hostage after four gunmen boarded it on wednesday			0
" and so i think this is going to take a while , and it may involve some third - party negotiations			0
" though he approves of the government 's handling of the situation so far , @entity21 said the situation not an easy one			1
" this , to a certain extent , is the @entity4 government 's nightmare scenario , " said @entity21 , who oversaw the @entity4 government 's counterterrorism strategy from 2005 to 2009			1
" we had always planned for , but hoped that this kind of situation would n't happen -- where a @entity4 vessel was taken or a @entity4 citizen was taken in those waters , " he said			2
he called the standoff " a classic hostage situation , which is difficult to resolve			2
it is certainly difficult to resolve on the high seas where we have limited levers to play			1
" ireport.com : how should the @entity4 respond ? @entity21 said the hostage holders appear to be in the stronger position , though at first glance -- four men holding a fifth aboard a 28 - foot powerless lifeboat in the ocean hundreds of miles from shore -- that may not appear to be the case			1
" i think they have the upper hand , in part , because we value the life of our citizens , " he said			0
" they may not value their lives as much , and they may not be using the same rational calculus that we would in this situation			0
" but , he said , the pirates may not be able to turn that advantage into victory			0
" i think the good guys will win , " he said			1
ireport.com : ' stop the pirates , @entity148 ! ' " i think we 'll find a way out of this			0
i think the @entity153 hostage negotiators , the naval personnel on scene and others will find a way of negotiating their way out of this			0
they 're professionals ; they know how to do that			0
