@entity0 , @entity1 -- just days after @entity1 marked the one - year countdown to the @entity7 with fireworks , pomp and ceremony , the @entity1 co-designer of the @entity5 ' most iconic stadium has slammed the event as a public - relations sham			1
@entity13 : " can a nation be celebrated and be so proud with this ignoring of its past ? " @entity13 , one of @entity1 's foremost architects , said he feels " disgusted " that the $ 400 million , " @entity25 " @entity18 he helped design with @entity21 architects @entity22 has become a proud symbol of @entity1 's development			1
" i 've already forgotten about it			0
i turn down all the demands to have photographs with it			0
i 'm not interested , " the portly artist told @entity2 at a studio in @entity0 's northeast suburbs			2
" i would feel ashamed if i just designed something for glamour or to show some kind of fake image			2
" last wednesday , @entity1 and @entity7 officials hosted a 10,000 - strong celebration gala with fireworks , dancers and pop stars on @entity42 , scene of a bloody army crackdown on student - led pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989			1
@entity13 's criticism stands in marked contrast to the upsurge in national pride the @entity7 has generated , though it does join a chorus of deliberately timed criticism from mainly foreign rights groups			1
the designer , who once smashed a 2,000 - year - old @entity56 vase for art , speaks candidly -- and from personal experience			0
@entity13 was raised in a labor camp in @entity1 's remote northwestern region of @entity61 , after his father , @entity62 -- himself regarded as one of @entity1 's finest modern poets -- was purged in the 1950s after being denounced as " an enemy of the state and a rightist			1
" " i spent five years with him at a labor camp where he cleaned toilets , but these stories become so catchy today , " @entity13 shrugged			1
" i have my own problems			0
" he likened @entity1 's embrace of the @entity7 as a " pretend smile			1
" " can a nation be celebrated and be so proud with this ignoring of its past ? " @entity13 asked , sitting on a bench next to one of his works , a distended wooden slab called " @entity83			1
" " can you have the self - confidence to clearly examine yourself , rather than to give this kind of pretend smile on your face ... it 's this kind of fake smile which is disgusting ... so i hate this			2
" when asked about what @entity1 was trying to hide , @entity13 said : " there are too many things			1
the whole political structure , the condition of civil rights ... corruption , pollution , education , you name it			0
" " then just say ' let 's forget about all this , ' let 's just light some big fireworks , let 's have those stupid directors , those people are such opportunists and they just become part of the powerful manipulators because they have no self - consciousness and have such bad taste			0
" @entity13 said the 91,000 - seat " @entity25 " remained a beautiful , if regretful , commission			2
" i did it because i love design and the idea of how it would be looked at by others , " he said			0
" i can also do self - criticism			0
