-- the political gridlock that has impeded progress on @entity4 's myriad policy challenges may be broken at long last			2
with their thumping victory in the @entity7 of @entity4 's parliament -- known as the diet -- the ruling coalition , led by the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , now effectively controls the country 's legislative body			2
but now there are no excuses ; power brings responsibility and prime minister @entity18 has to deliver on all the promises and pledges that have piled up over the past several months			1
@entity18 is credited with helping the @entity4 economy regain its mojo after two decades of stagnation , but it 's not time for any " mission accomplished " complacency			1
so - called " @entity26 " involves three policy " arrows " -- extreme monetary easing , massive fiscal stimulus and sweeping structural reforms			1
the first two arrows represent the low - hanging fruit because quantitative flooding and ratcheting up public works spending face no organized opposition			0
igniting the stock market , however , is the easy part and remains a fragile success ; when @entity42 chairman @entity41 mentioned " tapering " global markets , including @entity4 's @entity44 , swooned			1
@entity18 's recovery strategy aims to reflate the economy and boost consumption , but structural reforms are the key to a sustainable growth strategy			1
this third arrow remains a work in progress			0
when @entity55 unveiled a beta version of its structural reforms in june , markets reacted badly because there was nothing sweeping about the tentative measures			1
there is widespread and justifiable concern that @entity18 will have a tough time enacting bold structural reforms and anything less than audacious will disappoint markets and undermine positive trends and perceptions			1
@entity18 needs to take on the vested interests in @entity4 that have much to lose , but they are well represented in his @entity11			1
can he maintain party discipline and provide the leadership that @entity4 has lacked since @entity75 's tenure as premier ( 2001 - 2006 ) ? back in the driver 's seat , the @entity11 may no longer feel the same sense of urgency about structural reforms and powerful constituents will lobby the party to water down or abandon aggressive revamping			1
@entity4 is participating in the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) , a market - opening deal that involves the @entity87 and several smaller economies in the @entity89			0
the farming lobby opposes opening @entity4 's agricultural market and last year when former prime minister @entity93 proposed joining the @entity85 , he was handed a " forget about it ! " petition with eleven million signatures			2
that 's a lot of reasons to believe that the @entity85 's " no sacred cows " approach to market opening may prove a deal breaker for @entity4			2
agriculture may generate only 1 % of @entity4 's gdp , but its aging , part - time farmers are overrepresented in the @entity106 and are loyal supporters of the @entity11			2
market opening enjoys the support of @entity4 's leading exporters , the global marquee firms that are industry leaders , but exports represent only about 13 % of @entity4 's gdp			2
domestic firms are not as competitive and are very anxious about the prospects of market opening measures , while the medical lobby is painting @entity119 scenarios about the consequences for national health care insurance , something that @entity4 's aging society wants to protect from the vagaries of impersonal market forces			2
structural reforms face other serious headwinds			1
can the @entity11 push through comprehensive deregulation of the electricity market against the regional monopolies ? why does @entity4 pay 4 - 5 times the global price for lng imports ? @entity18 also faces stiff public opposition over his plans to restart the nation 's idled nuclear reactors			1
he is seen to be in the " nuclear village 's " pocket , the vested interests in business and bureaucratic circles that advocate nuclear energy			0
but some 70 % of the @entity4 public favors phasing out nuclear power because of lingering safety concerns ; 150,000 people remain displaced by the three reactor meltdowns in 2011			0
moreover , @entity151 's ongoing clean - up at the crippled @entity150 nuclear plant has been marred by a series of screw - ups worthy of the @entity155 cops and there are concerns that new safety guidelines may be trumped by political expediency			0
@entity18 also wants to push ahead with tax and social welfare reforms that will prove divisive			1
he favors a big corporate tax cut , but the @entity163 is worried about fiscal rehabilitation ; @entity4 's public debt to gdp ratio is 240 %			0
he is also undecided about proceeding with a planned hike of the sales tax for fear it will stifle the nascent recovery			0
plans to cut social welfare benefits reinforce growing perceptions that @entity26 is welfare for the wealthy and that labor market deregulation will lead to a hollowing out of the middle class			0
while @entity18 says that battling deflation requires increased consumption , a recent poll shows that 90 % of @entity4 do n't think they benefit from @entity26 , according to @entity4 broadcaster , @entity184 tv news			1
after all , 38 % of the entire workforce is engaged in low paid , dead - end jobs with no job security , doubling the rate two decades ago			0
improving conditions for this precariat is crucial to battling deflation			0
critics believe that @entity18 's trickle - down economics will leave the most vulnerable high and dry			1
increasing productivity and wages of these workers is key to @entity4 's recovery			1
women also remain marginalized in the workforce , where the gender - wage gap is double the @entity202 average and there are very few become managers			0
aside from providing more day care , @entity18 has been vague about how he plans to make it happen for @entity4 women -- but as they fare so fares @entity4			2
all the reasons cited above reinforce the adage : " it 's the economy stupid ! " but can @entity18 resist his ideological and nationalist inclinations ? @entity18 's pet project is constitutional revision ; he wants to jettison the war - renouncing @entity216 9 -- signed in the wake of @entity4 's @entity220 defeat to outlaw war as a means of settling future disputes -- and curtail civil liberties			1
but he does n't have the votes to get it done			0
opinion : @entity4 politicians struggle with wartime past so there is considerable speculation about whether @entity18 plans to visit the controversial @entity232 in mid-august when @entity4 's surrender is commemorated			1
since 1978 , when 14 @entity237 war criminals were enshrined there , @entity234 and @entity235 never visited this sacred site			0
@entity232 is indelibly tarnished by associations with wartime shinto and an unrepentant view of @entity4 's @entity244 rampage 1931 - 45			0
@entity18 has long supported patriotic education and an airbrushed history , one that is featured at the adjacent @entity248			2
there one encounters a valorizing and exonerating version of @entity4 imperialism and what @entity255 writer @entity254 terms " aggressive self - pity			0
" the national cemetery is @entity258 and that is where he and his ministers should honor the war dead			0
@entity18 has found redemption in victory and need not sully @entity4 's international image by trying to rehabilitate a shabby chapter in @entity4 's history			1
after all , there is much @entity4 can take pride in , and the world admires about , post-war @entity4 as a cornerstone of regional peace and prosperity			0
can the " real " @entity18 be kept under wraps ? his spin - doctors offer reassurances , but @entity18 expresses regret that he did n't visit during his first tenure as premier ( 2006 - 2007 )			2
that was because he was busy fence - mending with @entity281 and @entity282 following @entity75 's repeated visits to @entity232 that sent @entity4 's regional relations into a tailspin			0
@entity18 has demonstrated that history is not his forte , but this is one lesson he ignores at his peril			2
@entity4 's most important strategic imperative is forging better ties with @entity281 and given his conservative nationalist credentials , @entity18 is in a good position to build a future oriented relationship			1
regarding the territorial dispute with @entity300 over the @entity302 / @entity302 islands , @entity296 's claim that there is no dispute is a diplomatic dead - end that impedes hammering out a modus vivendi			0
its time for confidence building measures , not counterproductive gestures about history ; the 2008 agreement for joint development of hydrocarbon resources in the @entity311 that shelves issues of sovereignty could be a useful step forward			0
is @entity18 up to the job or will he lurch backward ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity318 .			1

@entity18 's recovery strategy aims to reflate the economy and boost consumption
there is widespread concern that @entity18 will have a tough time enacting bold structural reforms
but anything less than audacious will disappoint markets , says @entity318
@entity318 says @entity18 must also tread carefully with his ideological , nationalist inclinations
