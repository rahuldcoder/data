does n't disappoint with new characters , a story line with uber - villain @entity6 and a new mode designed to make it easy to get involved in the action			1
after a 10 - year hiatus , the popular fighting game brings the battle zones into the third dimension			1
while action remains in two dimensions , the characters are generated in @entity20 and provide for a more robust visual image of the fighting			1
each fight can be one - on - one or tag - team , with three characters on each side			1
one of the biggest question marks as the game 's release neared was who would be in and who would be left off of the @entity32 and @entity12 casts			1
@entity33 , special combat adviser for @entity12 , said the company wanted to achieve a balance between @entity37 and @entity38 characters			1
" we wanted to include the fan faves [ from @entity37 ] as well as the key characters from @entity32 , " he said			1
" but we also wanted to include some fringe characters that have n't been featured before to appeal to each audience			1
" thirty - six characters are playable right away , with two more available as downloadable content			1
signature characters like @entity47 and @entity48 make their return , but only comic book fans may recognize some of the other characters			1
" we included the super-skrull because we could n't have the @entity53 and we wanted to have them represented somehow , " @entity33 said			0
" we chose @entity32 characters that @entity37 fans would think were cool			1
" @entity33 said each character has unique and special fighting abilities , so one character does n't feel or act like another			1
@entity12 characters are defined by their moves , he said , while the @entity32 characters are defined by their powers			1
that structure helped balance out the game and make it fun			1
" with so many moves and abilities , it becomes more strategic , " he said			0
" which characters can i choose to cover up some weaknesses , or do i just play to my strengths ? it is up to the player to figure out how to use them			1
" the fighting system , while criticized in past versions for the complex button mashing and joystick gyrations required to achieve moves , has also been retooled			1
in an effort to gain fans and reach out to more casual players , the game can be played in simple mode , where only three buttons are needed to attack an opponent			2
this affords new fans who may be familiar with the characters , but not the game , the ability to get into the action right away			1
" we really wanted to make the game easy to get into , " @entity33 said			2
" simple mode gives you three attack buttons : light , medium and heavy			0
there is also one ' hyper combo ' and two special attacks			0
by contrast , [ @entity12 character ] @entity104 has 35 different attacks in the normal mode			0
" a " mission mode " helps players learn the normal attacks , if they want to			0
the missions take characters through different stages where they work on a particular attack to get its sequences right			2
using attacks in particular combinations increases the player 's power bar , which grants hyper combos and team combos in three - on - three action			2
@entity33 said designers added a behind - the - scenes feature called hit - stun scaling that prevents infinite combo loops			2
" it took us three years to develop the game , and a lot of that time goes into balance and technical , " he said			1
" we 've designed it for the long term and really think fans are going to enjoy how it plays			0
" arcade mode is where the story line comes in			0
each universe 's top bad guy -- dr. @entity144 for @entity32 and @entity145 ( from " @entity146 " ) for @entity12 -- decides to join forces to beat the good guys and rule their respective domains			0
however , as big , evil plans often turn out , their efforts are recognized by someone even more powerful than they are : the world eater @entity6			0
@entity6 decides he wants both worlds , and the heroes and villains from each must unite to defeat him			0
teams of three characters each do battle against each other to determine who will be strong enough to take on the galactic titan			2
@entity33 said a unique ending sequence plays out for each character after the final battle , and each has alternate uniforms and dialogue that are unique to the character 's persona			0
@entity173 characters will also make appearances during the story line to add flavor and interest in the mission			2
characters also have powers and abilities that come out only during specific times in a battle			2
for example , @entity32 's @entity184 will transform to @entity184 after her life bar runs down			0
this includes more powerful attacks but costs @entity184 in life points as time goes on			0
" @entity3 " does n't fail to impress			1
the way difficulty can be scaled down should win over new fans while allowing more advanced fighting players to jump right in			2
simple mode took me through the battles quickly and let me get familiar with some of the new abilities and characters			2
jumping into mission mode helped me learn moves that i utilized in normal mode and made the action even more vibrant			0
@entity12 also hit the mark with interesting voice and movement additions for each character that really heighten enjoyment of the game			0
@entity212 's taunting and breaking the fourth wall to speak directly to the player were unexpected and very funny			0
sure , some are going to quibble over which characters were included and which were left out			0
but with 36 to choose from , it will be hard for players to not find a character from either universe they 'll enjoy playing			0
it all works and will provide hours of enjoyment , even after @entity6 is defeated			0
and with more downloadable content promised , we wo n't have to wait 10 more years to use @entity226 ( for the uninitiated , that 's a special attack ) on new opponents			1
" @entity3 : fate of @entity11 " is rated t for teens			1
it was released this week for the @entity235 and @entity236 consoles			0
this review was done with the @entity235 version .			0
