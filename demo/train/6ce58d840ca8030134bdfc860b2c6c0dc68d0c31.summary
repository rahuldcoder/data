@entity0 -- @entity1 's @entity2 and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each sunday on " @entity5 " to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days , weeks and months ahead			1
insights on the reluctant " wartime president " and a concerned former president were part of a trip around the " @entity5 " table that also highlighted an effort to leverage @entity16 political might , @entity18 's minority outreach and a dilemma as @entity21 groups try to undermine potential @entity23 spoilers			1
back to the future : @entity25 adopts @entity26 as a 2014 project for political junkies of any ideological persuasion , watching @entity25 on the stump is a treat , and it 's an added bonus when he is back home in @entity26			1
this past week , he was in fine form as he tried to give a boost to embattled @entity37 sen. @entity36 and other @entity38 , including gubernatorial candidate @entity39			2
missed it ? not to worry			2
@entity41 of the @entity42 tells us you will get another chance			2
" i 'm told he 's not just going back once , he 's going to go back two more times to @entity26 : when early voting begins later this month , @entity2 , and then right before @entity50 , " said @entity41			1
" as one longtime friend of @entity25 told me -- who knows him better than anybody -- said if he could , he 'd be doing direct - mail pieces			1
" while the former president does know several of the candidates on the ballot in @entity26 , @entity41 notes this involvement is n't motivated just by his friendships			1
" he also cares about retaining some kind of @entity37 strength in a state that has gone to the right , and i think he wants to try and make it at least potentially viable for his wife in 2016 , " said @entity41			0
the current commander in chief bemoans ' wartime ' label president @entity69 was first elected on a promise to get @entity72 troops out of the @entity73 , but he will wind down the final two years of his term directing a sustained military campaign against the terror group @entity76			1
and unlike @entity77 , who embraced the " wartime president " label after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , this commander in chief prefers not to be characterized that way			1
@entity82 of @entity83 took us inside the @entity86 debate over how to handle the balancing act			0
" one of the concerns is that they do n't want to present him as a wartime president , because he was campaigning as a person who got the @entity72 out of wars , but they also want to make sure that he looks like he is managing the situation , " said @entity82			1
" so while you 're not going to see the president making trips to war zones overseas , you are going to see more pictures of him meeting with commanders at the @entity103 , perhaps traveling to bases around the country			1
the whole idea is to show that even though he 'd rather be talking about other things , he 's still on top of this			1
@entity111 see @entity113 advances as an example worth following as @entity111 look to maximize their political clout , @entity116 of the @entity117 says some key activists have an example of steady , if sometimes slow , progress			1
@entity116 shared reporting about a recent @entity122 summit of @entity16 , legal and labor activists , which took place just as the @entity125 declined to hear challenges to several state laws allowing same - sex marriages			0
for @entity111 who at times are frustrated with both political parties , and other obstacles , @entity116 said the big week for lgbt rights was not unnoticed			1
" they are modeling this a lot on what the gay rights movement has done over the past two decades , " said @entity116			0
" obviously they had a very good week			0
the hope is to accelerate that and potentially make some gains in the next few cycles			0
@entity18 goes to @entity143 and promises he is a different kind of @entity21 @entity145 sen. @entity18 spends a lot of time and energy promising to expand the @entity21 tent , and trying to prove wrong skeptics in the @entity152 - @entity72 community who cite , among other things , past statements questioning provisions of the landmark @entity157			0
this past week , he was off to @entity143 , @entity159 , and @entity160 of the @entity117 reported on why @entity18 wanted to make the trip and how it fit into his larger strategy			2
" what 's going to be interesting to see from @entity18 is if these are conversations that he continues , " said @entity163			2
" part of it is he obviously wants to expand the @entity21 , but he 's also got the challenge of whether or not he 's going to be a leader in his own party on moving that party , not only in talking about criminal justice reform , but also in talking about race and racism and discrimination			2
tv time scarce , so @entity21 allies look for digital ad platforms to target @entity179 pro-republican super pacs are nervous that several @entity23 candidates in key @entity183 races are shaping up as spoilers , and they are looking to find ways to peel off some of their support			0
but they are also encountering a problem : tv ad time is scarce in the final three weeks of the campaign , especially in the big battleground states			0
@entity193 is one of the biggest concerns			0
most @entity21 strategists believe that if the election were held today , @entity37 sen. @entity197 would win , in part because of support for @entity23 candidate @entity201			0
so the @entity202 and other groups are looking for ways to try to boost @entity21 @entity205 by taking after @entity201			0
but with tv time so scarce , the effort has forced a search for digital advertising platforms			0
and more old - school tactics also are likely to be added to the mix : phone banks and direct mail .			0

@entity25 plans two trips back to @entity26 before *midterms*
@entity69 's strategy is to avoid the " wartime president " label
