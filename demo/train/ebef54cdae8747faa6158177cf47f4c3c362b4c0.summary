-- @entity1 calls out to her three children as she takes pizza bagels out of the oven			1
@entity5 , 18 months old , runs to her high chair chanting , " pizza , pizza ! " @entity9 , 7 , comes in from another room in their @entity12 home			1
they join their sister , @entity16 , who is already at the table			2
@entity18 sits down next to his son while @entity1 puts food on everyone 's plates			2
they seem like the quintessential family , in what could be any household in @entity27			1
but a closer look reveals @entity1 is feeding 5 - year - old @entity16			1
@entity16 can not talk or walk			2
she needs help sitting up and doing most anything a girl her age should be doing on her own			2
@entity16 has a progressive neurological disorder called @entity34 , also known as @entity35			2
it 's a rare genetic disease that is more common among @entity37 , or people of @entity39 and @entity41 descent			1
there is no treatment or cure			2
@entity16 's mental development was halted at 18 months old			2
she is expected to go blind by age 12			2
doctors say she will not live beyond early adulthood			2
@entity16 's diagnosis was confirmed just before the @entity51 in september 2009			2
instead of focusing on the wonderful things the next year would bring , @entity1 says their family 's dreams were shattered			2
" anything that we had dreamed and hoped for our family at that point was broken			2
so how did this happen ? @entity1 and @entity18 struggled with that very question			2
knowing that one in five @entity37 in the @entity27 are carriers for a genetic disease , the @entity61 were screened before they got married			1
@entity1 was screened for just eight of the 16 @entity41 genetic diseases that were being screened for in 2004			1
@entity18 was screened for two			2
proponents for standardized screening say it could have spared or prepared the @entity61 for what they are going through with @entity16			1
screening assesses a couple 's reproductive risk , says @entity74 , a genetic counselor at @entity75 in @entity12			1
couples who are both carriers for the same disease have a 25 % chance of passing that disease onto their children			1
many of these disorders are fatal , says dr. @entity84 , the chair of the department of human genetics at @entity75 , and they can severely impact patients ' quality of life			2
a bright future when @entity18 and @entity1 met , their love blossomed quickly			2
they dated for eight months before getting engaged and were married three months later			0
they did n't waste time starting a family either			0
fifteen months after their walk down the aisle , they welcomed @entity9 into their lives			0
the @entity61 , now a family , were living the dream			0
that dream included a bigger family ; @entity16 was born two years later			0
but when @entity16 was just 3 months old , @entity1 started wondering whether something was wrong with her precious little girl			0
she could n't quite put her finger on it			0
at first @entity16 did n't seem to be meeting her milestones on time			0
then they noticed she had low muscle tone			0
at 9 months , @entity16 started physical therapy and had surgery to correct her crossed eyes			0
doctors hoped she 'd have a better view of the world and everything else would fall into place			0
the pediatrician continued to reassure @entity1 that every child develops at her own rate			0
at one point , @entity1 was even told she should stop comparing her second child to her first and just enjoy her daughter			0
" we finally decided that being told , ' she 's gon na be fine ' or ' not to worry so much ' just was n't enough , " @entity1 remembers			0
against their pediatrician 's advice , they took @entity16 to a neurologist who did an @entity134 on her brain			0
@entity1 and @entity18 hold back tears as they remember the phone call from the neurologist at 9:30 p.m. he did n't know what was wrong with their daughter , he said , but it was n't good			0
" it was more than a sad moment , " @entity18 says			0
" it was the beginning of what became a lot of sad moments			0
" the neurologist ran more tests before referring @entity16 to a geneticist			0
the geneticist thought it might be a @entity41 genetic disease , but the @entity61 told him they had been screened			1
still , when he described @entity35 , @entity18 remembers thinking he had just described @entity16			0
they waited two agonizing weeks for the lab to confirm the diagnosis			0
until screening is routine as difficult as it was to hear the news about @entity16 , the @entity61 never ask , " why us ? " instead , @entity18 says , " we decided to make sure that the tragedy of @entity16 's story does n't happen to another family			1
" they started by creating a comprehensive education program to teach doctors , rabbis and young couples in their community about the risks			1
then they lobbied insurance companies and medical labs to standardize genetic screening , make it more accessible and lower the cost			1
their work inspired the @entity178 and @entity75 to create @entity179 , a web - based national screening program for the 19 most common @entity41 genetic diseases , including @entity35 , that launched this month			1
while it 's targeted at the @entity41 population , the site also offers an expanded screening panel to check for a total of 80 genetic diseases , which may be more appropriate for @entity188 spouses of a @entity41 carrier or for those who are unsure of their ancestry			1
there 's no trip to the doctor or needle needed to draw blood			0
people who are interested in being screened can visit @entity197 , read about the screening test and request a kit			1
a box with the saliva test is then sent to the individual 's home with instructions and an envelope to return the completed kit to the lab. approximately four weeks later , results are discussed with a genetic counselor over the phone			1
additional counseling can then be scheduled with a local genetic counselor			1
the kit costs $ 99 for most people with insurance and $ 599 if you are uninsured			0
unlike direct - to - consumer genetic testing , offered by companies such as @entity218 , @entity179 is a nonprofit program with an educational component			1
every request for screening is reviewed by a genetic counselor at @entity75 before a kit is sent out to make sure that the patient fully understands what the results can ( and can not ) tell them			1
@entity84 believes genetic testing will be part of routine medical care for every potential parent in the coming years ; @entity179 is just the start , he says			1
" we are looking at this as a prototype to see how well we can do this for the general population			0
" @entity239 is the goal , says @entity74 , who is also the senior director of outreach initiatives for @entity179			1
" in every ethnic group , there are diseases ... unless you have screening , you can have an affected kid			1
" carrier screening programs for @entity41 genetic diseases have seen success in the past , she says ; in the 1970s and ' 80s , the fatal condition @entity253 was reduced by approximately 90 %			1
but genetics is a rapidly changing field ; the human body has hundreds of thousands of genes and mutations , and new ones are being discovered			0
new screening tests are also being developed quickly			1
when the @entity61 were married in 2004 , screening tests were available for 16 @entity41 genetic diseases			1
now scientists can screen for up to 19			1
the ability to make informed decisions @entity84 says parents of children affected by these types of diseases overwhelmingly say they would have wanted to know before they became pregnant			1
armed with the right knowledge , a couple may chose to avoid the risk by using alternative pregnancy paths , such as adoption or in vitro fertilization			0
if there 's a risk , a couple could also choose to have amniocentesis or @entity280 testing done during pregnancy to check the fetus			0
the results could give the parents time to plan for the birth of a baby that will need special care			0
or they may choose to end the pregnancy , says @entity74			0
aware of their risk , @entity1 and @entity18 added a beautiful , healthy baby girl to their family last year			0
they used pre-implantation genetic testing and @entity297 to ensure their new little one would not have @entity299			1
the @entity61 celebrated the @entity51 again last week with their three beautiful children			0
this year , they are hoping to encourage 7,000 people to get screened for preventable genetic diseases			1
" @entity16 is here to save lives , and if that 's what she 's here to do , there is no life more noble than that , " @entity18 says .			0
