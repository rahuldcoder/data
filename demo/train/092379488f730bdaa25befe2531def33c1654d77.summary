the trial of the son of former @entity3 leader @entity2 and dozens of other former regime officials resumed in @entity5 on sunday , in continued defiance of the @entity7 that last week rejected @entity3 's plea to try @entity9 domestically			1
@entity9 , once his father 's heir apparent , has been held in the western mountain city of @entity13 by the militiamen who captured him in 2011			1
the group has refused to hand him over to the central government , citing security concerns and lawlessness in the capital			0
he appeared via videolink from a courthouse in @entity13 , while more than 20 former officials were in the south @entity5 courtroom			2
eight other former regime members being held in @entity26 also appeared on a videolink			0
the officials are facing charges relating to the 2011 revolution and attempts to suppress the uprising , including the killing of protesters , a crime punishable by death			0
the fourth session of the trial comes less than a week after the @entity7 's appeals chamber upheld an earlier decision by the international court demanding that @entity3 hand over @entity9 to the @entity43			1
@entity3 submitted put in a legal request to try @entity9 domestically in 2012 , but it was rejected by the @entity7 last year and later appealed by the @entity46 country			1
wednesday 's decision by the @entity7 appeals chamber is a final			2
the @entity7 had indicted both @entity9 and former spy chief @entity50 for alleged war crimes in 2011			1
@entity52 , who was extradited to @entity3 from @entity53 two years ago , also appeared in court on sunday , looking frail and as if he had lost weight			0
although the international court granted @entity3 the right to try @entity50 last year , his @entity7 - appointed lawyer was appealing the ruling			1
@entity3 has insisted that unlike under the @entity9 regime , the defendants will receive a fair trial			1
but rights groups have raised concerns about the ongoing trial , especially the use of videolink that they say does not allow them to communicate with their lawyers before and during sessions			0
other concerns include limited access of some defendants to legal counsel , and some defendants still have no lawyers			0
during sunday 's session @entity9 still did not have a court - appointed lawyer , and @entity50 's attorney was absent			2
without the presence of defense lawyers , the two did not enter a plea or respond to charges read by the judge			0
the other defendants denied the charges			0
some of them became emotional as they addressed the court			0
@entity91 , the former head of foreign intelligence , denied the charges calling them " fabricated " and " politically motivated			0
" the trial was adjourned to june 22 after the prosecution and defense attorneys requested more time to prepare their cases			0
@entity3 's government , which has been in the midst of its worst political and security crisis since the revolution , has not yet commented on the @entity7 's latest decision			1
legal experts say the country could face consequences for its refusal to hand over @entity9 to @entity43 , but only if steps are taken by the international community			0
" sanctions can be imposed on @entity3 by the @entity112 for @entity3 's non-compliance , and @entity3 's membership in various international organizations could be suspended and / or made conditional on @entity3 surrendering @entity116 to the @entity7 , if states wish to insist on it , " @entity109 , @entity9 's @entity7 - appointed defense lawyer , told @entity110 on saturday			1
" therefore the matter is in the hands of the international community , in particular states like the @entity122 and @entity123 , which are both members of the @entity7 and permanent members of the @entity112			0
" @entity109 insisted that @entity3 must hand @entity9 over to the @entity7 , saying his rights have been " gravely violated " since his capture more than two years ago			1
violations include @entity9 being held in solitary confinement in a secret location and being denied visits by friends and family , according to @entity109			2
" @entity3 is paralyzed and unable to protect the rights and security of @entity3 , including judges , lawyers and judicial police and detainees , much less the rights of a person like mr. @entity9 , " @entity109 said			2
@entity142 and @entity143 , who have also raised concerns about the deteriorating security situation in the country , have also renewed their call for @entity3 to hand over @entity9 to @entity43			2
" the @entity7 appeals decision only reinforces @entity3 's long overdue obligation to surrender @entity116 to @entity43 , " said @entity149 , international justice director			1
" @entity3 authorities should show the same respect for @entity7 procedures as they did when they first engaged the court on @entity9 's case			1
" crowds rally in @entity3 to support retired general 's campaign @entity3 : why it 's all gone so badly wrong			2

@entity9 continues to be tried while being held in western @entity3
dozens of other @entity2 regime officials are on trial in @entity5
the @entity7 rejected @entity3 's bid to try the younger @entity9
