-- the chief prosecutor for the @entity2 said in a report wednesday there are " reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity have been committed and continue being committed in @entity8			1
" the report highlighted the alleged commission of rape by @entity8 leader @entity12 's government , as well as the deportation or forcible transfer of citizens during the civil war that continues to rage in that country			1
it also noted war crimes , including intentionally directing attacks against civilians not participating in the fighting			2
@entity2 prosecutor @entity23 issued a statement saying he will soon request arrest warrants against three individuals who are " most responsible for the crimes committed			1
" the individuals were not named			0
" it is indeed a characteristic of the situation in @entity8 that massive crimes are reportedly committed upon instruction of a few persons who control the organizations that execute the orders , " the report said			1
" arresting those who ordered the commission of crimes , should the judges decide to issue warrants , will contribute to the protection of civilians in @entity8			1
" in march , shortly after the @entity2 was asked to investigate the issue , a court spokeswoman said @entity12 would probably face serious charges			1
but the prosecutor did not name the people against whom he had evidence			0
" even today , people in @entity51 are arrested illegally , tortured and they disappear , " @entity23 told @entity0			0
" we have evidence of that and we will show it to the judges			0
" it is not clear if he plans to file charges against anyone on the rebel side , though the report mentioned " alleged war crimes as well as other crimes against humanity " appear to have been committed by " different parties			2
" he warned when he opened the probe two months ago that the rebels are subject to international law just as @entity12 's forces are			1
" now , there are people opposing @entity12 with weapons			1
and also we would like to warn them , you can not commit crimes			0
our business in @entity8 is ( to ) stop the crimes , " he told @entity0 in march			2
@entity78 , the @entity79 ambassador to the @entity80 , said the specter of @entity2 prosecution " should warn those around @entity12 about the perils of continuing to tie their fate to his			1
" " @entity12 has lost any and all legitimacy to lead @entity8 , " she said , remarking on " widespread and systematic attacks " against civilians by government forces			1
her comments were later echoed by the acting deputy spokesman for the @entity93 , @entity94 , who called on @entity12 to cease hostilities and to " allow the @entity96 and other organizations to provide much needed relief and evacuation services to civilians caught up in the @entity8 conflict			1
" he said the @entity79 is making available an additional $ 6.5 million for the migration organization 's operations in @entity8			1
that means the @entity79 now is shelling out a total of $ 53.5 million in emergency assistance " to meet the humanitarian needs of conflict victims , vulnerable migrants , and others displaced by the civil unrest in @entity8 , " he said			1
but the @entity113 ambassador to the @entity80 said @entity113 is " deeply alarmed by the growing number of civilian causalities and the destruction of civilian facilities as a result of the actions by opposing @entity8 parties			1
" " unfortunately it must be noted that actions by @entity125 - led coalition forces also lead to civilian causalities , " said ambassador @entity121			2
" this took place in particular during recent bombings in @entity51			0
" he warned against exceeding the mandate established by @entity131 , which allows military action in @entity8 to protect civilians			1
" any disproportionate use of force is unacceptable , " he said			0
this is the first time the @entity2 has begun investigating possible crimes against humanity as they were occurring in wartime , @entity23 said			2
social networking websites such as @entity141 were part of the reason that was possible , he said			0
" this triggered a very quick reaction			0
the ( @entity80 ) @entity147 reacted in a few days , the @entity146 reacted in a few days			2
so , now because the @entity2 is up and running we can do this immediately , " he said			2
" i think @entity8 is a new world , " he added			2
" how we manage the new challenge , that 's what we will see now			0
" the @entity155 used wednesday 's meeting to support investigations in @entity8 , while also using the forum to urge @entity159 not to attack protesting civilians			1
" the deteriorating situation in @entity159 is of increasing concern in this regard , " said ambassador @entity161			2
" the violent repression there must stop immediately			0
" meanwhile , @entity12 's forces once again shelled @entity170 's port on wednesday , leaving five people dead and dozens injured , a rebel spokesman told @entity0			2
the shelling started around 1 p.m. " this is the only terminal we have for the city and for humanitarian vessels to come in and take foreigners out , " rebel spokesman @entity174 said			0
a few ambulances and private cars arrived on the scene to take the casualties away after the shelling stopped			0
the @entity96 told @entity0 that it had one chartered vessel that entered @entity170 's port early wednesday morning			0
@entity187 was made with the ship 's captain , and no one was injured on the boat			0
some 840 migrants have boarded the boat , and more were being placed on board , the @entity96 said			0
the vessel , which had brought 180 tons of humanitarian aid to @entity170 , was expected to depart in the afternoon			0
as the bloody battles in the @entity200 country dragged into their fourth month , a @entity80 official said the @entity8 government and opposition members were trying to find a way for a cease - fire			1
@entity205 , the @entity80 's special envoy to @entity8 , said both sides had told him that they were ready for a cease - fire			1
the only problem was that they disagreed on what conditions would be needed to lay down arms , the envoy said			0
the @entity8 government wants an end to @entity125 aerial attacks ; the opposition wants @entity12 to step down and will not negotiate with him or any of his family members , @entity205 said			1
" a real and credible cease - fire must be agreed upon to suspend aggressive actions and killing of innocent civilians , including women and children , " @entity205 told the @entity131 on tuesday			0
" a cease - fire must be declared either formally , or -- in a first step -- as part of an informal understanding between the opposing forces in @entity8			2
" @entity125 began bombing @entity8 on march 19 , after the @entity131 approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary , short of invasion , to protect civilians demanding the end of @entity12 's nearly 42 - year rule			1
this weekend , @entity8 authorities said one of @entity12 's sons and three of his grandchildren were killed by a @entity125 airstrike			1
this prompted an increase in @entity247 forces ' attacks in rebel - held cities and also in the beleaguered western port city of @entity170 , witnesses said			0
an explosion rocked @entity252 tuesday , the eastern city that is controlled by rebel fighters			0
the blast damaged several cars in @entity252 's main square and a rebel spokesman blamed it on @entity12 supporters who were somehow able to infiltrate the rebel - held city			2
@entity0 could not independently confirm that report			0
the continued fighting has sent people fleeing			0
more than 8,000 people -- most of them women and children -- fled into @entity269 over the weekend to escape the fighting between @entity8 government troops and opposition forces , the @entity80 high commissioner for refugees said tuesday nearly 40,000 @entity8 have fled the country 's western mountainous region in the past month as @entity276 and opposition forces have fought for control of the border crossing point , according to the @entity80 @entity0 's @entity279 and @entity280 contributed to this report .			1
