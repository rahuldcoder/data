after high - profile child rape cases , politicians worldwide tend to pledge a crackdown and harsher punishments for sex offenders , involving chemical castration , said @entity30 , professor of forensic psychiatry at @entity31			1
" in a way , i liken it to cutting the hand off the thief , " he said			0
" it 's very symbolic			0
" the use of chemical castration , while effective , remains controversial			1
while sex offenders may not be the most sympathetic group , critics say forced chemical castration violates human rights			1
