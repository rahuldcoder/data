@entity0 is @entity1 and @entity3 professor of economics and political science at the @entity5			1
he is the author of " @entity6 : the @entity8 and the @entity9 , 1919 - 39 " and " financial crises and @entity11 to do about them			2
" @entity0 says @entity12 will have to fix the credit crisis , the auto industry and trade policy			1
@entity16 , @entity17 ( @entity18 ) -- president - elect @entity12 has been holding his economic cards close to his vest			1
he did not participate in person at last weekend 's meeting of @entity24 leaders			2
he has been reluctant to encourage the lame - duck @entity25 to adopt a major fiscal stimulus package			1
he may be right in saying that the @entity27 has only one president at a time			2
but this makes it all the more important that he hit the ground running on january 20			2
this will mean , first of all , addressing the credit crisis			0
despite all the actions of the @entity37 and the @entity38 , the banks are still not lending			1
in some cases this is because their own finances are weak			0
but in others it is because they have other more convenient uses for their funds , ranging from acquisitions to dividend payments			0
this reflects a flawed bank recapitalization scheme that gives the government no voting shares in the banks into which it is injecting public funds and hence no say in their decisions			1
fortunately ( as it were ) there will be an opportunity to correct this , since as the recession deepens there will be more loan losses and the need for more capital injections			0
the next round of public money should come with voting rights so that taxpayers ' interests are protected			1
then there is the need for increased public spending on infrastructure and federal grants to state and local governments to offset the collapse of private spending			1
candidate @entity12 spoke of $ 150 billion of fiscal stimulus			1
but if this recession turns out to be the deepest since @entity83 , as now seems certain , the appropriate figure will be at least four times that large			1
anything less would fail to cushion the downturn			0
a trillion - dollar deficit will excite fears of government out of control if not accompanied by a plan to balance the budget once the recession ends			1
the new president therefore will need to offer not just a stimulus package but also a multiyear budget			1
then there is the problem of the auto industry			0
the best course normally would be chapter 11 bankruptcy			0
this would allow the @entity102 to shed bad management and contracts , both of which would be thrown out in the bankruptcy process			0
if @entity109 , @entity110 or @entity111 is then able to come up with a viable business plan , they should be able to obtain the new money , known as debtor - in - possession financing , needed to implement it			1
admittedly , the credit crisis makes new money difficult to obtain			2
but if this is a problem , then the government can provide the debtor - in - possession financing			2
in other words , it can make its aid conditional on the @entity102 first going through bankruptcy workouts			0
a further complication arises from the fact that cars last for years and when they break down are expensive to repair			0
warranties matter , in other words			0
if a producer was undergoing bankruptcy reorganization , from which it might or might not emerge , consumers would question whether its warranties were worth the paper they were written on			0
but if this is the problem , then the government can guarantee the warranties			2
it could reimburse the cost of major repairs subject to terms and conditions			0
it is not as if our government has been reluctant to guarantee other products , ranging from bank deposits to money market mutual funds			1
and this guarantee should be provided only to auto companies that undergo bankruptcy reorganization			0
finally , it will be important for the new president to reassure our foreign partners about his economic intentions			2
there may be jubilation in @entity159 and @entity160 over the election of a candidate they may view as a native son , but there is trepidation in @entity167 and @entity168 about his protectionist rhetoric			0
president @entity12 will need to reassure @entity171 that while he believes in labor and environmental standards , he also believes in @entity174			1
he should encourage the @entity25 to ratify our free trade agreements with @entity176 and @entity177			1
he should reassure the @entity178 , who now have economic problems of their own , that he will not bash them over their exchange rate policies			2
if @entity12 wishes to help @entity27 impacted by import competition there are better ways			1
he can expand trade adjustment assistance for displaced workers			2
he can propose wage insurance -- partial compensation for a limited period for workers moving to lower - paid jobs			0
he can ramp up spending on education and training			0
he can address concerns over the environment by proposing a carbon tax rather than allowing blame for global warming to be shifted to @entity171 and @entity178			0
that should be enough to keep the new president occupied for his first 100 days			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0 .			1

@entity0 : @entity12 will have *daunting* agenda on economy
he says government must take a voting stake in banks getting public money
@entity213 : economic stimulus package must be large , at least $ *600* billion
@entity12 should take steps to show he is committed to free trade , he says
