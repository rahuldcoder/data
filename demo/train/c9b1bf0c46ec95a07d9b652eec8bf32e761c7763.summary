-- it 's about to get more difficult to move between smartphone carriers and still keep your existing phone			1
smartphones purchased after saturday ca n't be legally unlocked without permission from the carrier , according to a recent ruling by the @entity9			1
@entity10 passed the @entity11 in 1998 , making it illegal to access copyrighted content and break digital rights management technologies			1
the software that locks a smartphone to one carrier is covered by the act , and unlocking a phone is the process of freeing a device so that it can be used with a different wireless carrier			1
the @entity9 has the ability to grant exemptions to the @entity11 , which it has done in the past for smartphone users who wished to unlock their phones			1
that changed with the most recent group of exemptions that went into effect october 28 , but the switch included a 90 - day grace period that ends saturday , as @entity35 pointed out			0
the new policy only applies to new locked phones purchased after saturday , meaning it will still be legal to unlock phones purchased before january 26 without permission			1
one way to get around the requirement is to buy a full - priced unlocked phone that does n't have a contract , but doing so adds hundreds of dollars to the phone 's price tag			2
carriers subsidize the costs of smartphones to draw new customers in with contracts , usually for two years , and then make back the money from monthly voice and data bills			0
in its latest ruling , the @entity9 decided the software on a phone is only licensed to the end user , meaning they do n't own it , so therefore the software is not covered by fair - use rules			0
groups that lobbied to keep the exemption argued that making unlocking illegal is anti-competitive and could result in costlier phones and more electronic waste since some consumers would have to buy a new device to switch carriers			2
but the final ruling says there are more options now for obtaining an unlocked phone than in previous years			0
many phones are available unlocked for full price , and carriers do have policies in place for unlocking phones			2
currently the rules vary from carrier to carrier			0
for example , @entity82 will unlock an iphone for current or past customers as long as all contracts have been fulfilled			0
and @entity88 's @entity87 is usable on @entity82 's network			0
however , it 's unclear whether carriers will tighten these rules about unlocked phones in the future .			2

unlocking smartphone bought after saturday illegal without carrier 's permission

older phones purchased before this saturday can still be unlocked *anytime*
