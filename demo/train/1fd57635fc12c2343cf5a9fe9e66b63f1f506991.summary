-- on september 26 , 43 student - teachers from the @entity3 training college disappeared			2
another three were found dead shortly afterward , one of them reportedly having had the skin stripped from his face			0
the students were in the town of @entity10 , in southwest @entity11 , on their way to protest the lack of school funding			1
the disappearances outraged @entity11 society , driving citizens to protest en mass across the country			1
popular opinion , that the crime was an act of state terrorism , has since been supported by reports that the students were abducted by local police on the order of @entity10 's mayor , who has been charged , and were turned over to the gang that then killed them			2
dozens of suspects have been arrested , including members of @entity10 's municipal police force and @entity10 's mayor and his wife , who reportedly have links with the @entity38 gang			0
@entity39 called the @entity41 incident the worst human rights crisis facing @entity11 since the 1968 massacre of unarmed students at @entity45			1
yet this is only the most atrocious of many acts of state violence to have occurred since the @entity11 government stepped up its war against the drug cartels			1
much of the country has witnessed massacres resulting from confrontations between traffickers and agents of the state -- police and the armed forces -- or between rival groups of criminals for the control of routes and markets			0
the toll of this war on human life has been massive			1
according to the @entity69 there were 95,000 violent deaths in the country between 2006 - 2012 , of which 60,000 are estimated to be associated with the drug war			1
in the same period , according to the @entity11 attorney general 's office , 25,000 people were reported missing			1
at the start of the crackdown on cartels , @entity11 requested and received support from the @entity79 in the form of the @entity81			1
agreed on in march 2007 , @entity79 funding to @entity11 increased from $ 40 million per year in the mid- 2000s to $ 1.5 billion in stage one of the initiative			1
the focus of @entity86 was to provide @entity11 security forces with equipment and training to counter drug trafficking			1
in response to the criticism that stage one had not addressed capacity building and institutional reform , " beyond @entity86 , " or stage two , included resources to improve the rule of law and strengthen communities			0
the results , however , have been abysmal			0
the reality is that traffickers have taken advantage of the institutional weakness and corruption of municipal governments to control local police and politicians			0
the poverty and marginalization of the peasants -- who have no access to credit , have to pay high prices for seeds , fertilizers and transport for their products , and lack the technology necessary for crops with high market value -- create an opportunity for traffickers , who employ them in the production of opium poppies or cannabis			0
and although they are paid at low rates , their illicit incomes are still higher than what they would receive from traditional crops			0
if it were n't for prohibition , however , the illegal crops would not be profitable			0
sadly , the absence of legal and moral limits is not exclusive to criminals , with state security forces committing atrocities under the pretext of the war on drugs			2
most recently , in june , seven soldiers were charged over the extrajudicial execution of 22 alleged traffickers in @entity148 , a village not far from @entity10			0
according to witnesses , the victims had already surrendered			0
and this is by no means an isolated event -- extrajudicial executions are a recurrent practice of both the army and navy , involved in a war that respects neither human rights nor the existing legal order			1
indeed , professors from the @entity160 and the @entity161 recently noted , as one translation of their work notes , that when federal police confronted criminals , " 2.6 suspects died per every person wounded			0
when the army was involved , deaths increased to nine , and when the navy participated , the number rose to 17 fatalities per one wounded			0
" meanwhile , after more than 10 years of the war on drugs , neither the supply nor the demand of illegal drugs has disappeared			2
in fact , there has not even been a reduction in supply on either side of the @entity79 border			0
at the same time , in @entity11 , the cartels have not gone away			1
in fact , they have multiplied as a result of fragmentation , while the level of violence has increased			2
the cases of @entity148 and @entity41 are only the most visible tips of the iceberg , with a deep - spreading base that is quickly undermining the already troubled institutions of local government throughout @entity11			1
violence is driving away investments that might otherwise bring development to marginalized zones even as the cartels , bolstered by the resources of the illicit drugs market , have diversified their activities and imposed @entity203 - style protection rackets on legal markets			2
ultimately , ending the failed war on drugs is now a matter of survival for @entity11			1
if @entity11 is to recover peace and normality , resources now devoted to combating trafficking must be rechanneled into capacity building , institutional reform of local forces , and prosecution of predatory crime			1
in addition , a new drug policy focused on health , with an emphasis on prevention , harm reduction and treatment , must replace the focus on police and military persecution			2
the truth is that the war on drugs has caused more harm than good			0
it is time for it to end .			0
