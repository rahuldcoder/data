-- with more teams than ever playing at football 's @entity4 , the chances of a powerhouse not qualifying are even slimmer than before			1
but the expanded field -- from 16 to 24 -- means there could be a few debutants in @entity9 in two years			1
sunday 's qualifying draw did n't produce a group of death , and the likes of two - time reigning champions @entity15 , the consistent @entity16 and always dangerous @entity17 should n't be sweating it out come the end of qualifying			1
@entity15 landed in a group with @entity20 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 -- and of the latter quintet , only @entity20 features in the top 50 in the @entity28 world rankings			1
instead of simply the group winner and best second - place finisher automatically qualifying , now the top two in the nine groups and best third - place finisher will automatically progress			2
the playoffs decide the final four places			0
@entity36 , population 30,000 and about to embark on its first qualifying campaign , drew the mighty @entity16 along with @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			2
@entity43 was paired with , among others , @entity45 -- the nation @entity43 boss @entity47 used to guide			2
as host , @entity9 is guaranteed a berth in the tournament but will be placed in a group where it will essentially play friendlies			2
in this case , @entity54 can look forward to facing @entity57 's @entity56			0
" now we know the 10 games we have to play , " @entity9 coach @entity58 was quoted as saying by @entity59			2
" it 's pretty good to play a team like @entity56 , as they will be prestigious matches			0
" @entity59 president @entity65 said @entity16 and @entity43 were two of the three member associations who opposed increasing the @entity4 field but the @entity9 was n't fussed			1
he did n't name the other member association against the move			0
" in any democracy , when the vast majority are in favor , you go forward with it even if @entity43 or @entity16 are n't for it , " he told reporters this week			1
" the five or six biggest teams do n't have much to worry about , but for the others it will be very competitive			0
" so 24 teams will be as good as 16 teams			1
" in another change , teams contesting two matches in one qualifying round will either play on a thursday and sunday , friday and monday or saturday and tuesday as part of @entity59 's " week of football " initiative			1
currently , international matches are mostly played on fridays and tuesdays			0
" it was a political decision , " @entity65 , a former @entity90 footballer of the year , said			0
" we took it to try and promote the football of national teams			0
" clubs play on almost every day of the week and as a result , international football has been pushed out of the limelight and we would like to see it take that limelight again			0
" @entity102 starts in september , two months after the @entity103 in @entity104 concludes			0
full draw : group a : @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 group b : @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 group c : @entity15 , @entity20 , @entity120 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity22 group d : @entity16 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity36 group e : @entity43 , @entity45 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 @entity127 : @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity39 , @entity132 @entity133 : @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 group h : @entity17 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 group i : @entity56 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity9 ( host )			1
