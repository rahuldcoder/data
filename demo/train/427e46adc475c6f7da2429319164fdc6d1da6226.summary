-- as @entity3 hosts the world 's second largest automobile trade show , its domestic market seems to be having some difficulty getting out of first gear			1
car manufacturers from across the world , along with @entity3 's homegrown car companies , have descended on @entity11 for the 12th edition of the biannual @entity14 show			1
global manufacturers view the still - modest percentage of car owners as leaving room for long - term growth			1
boasting increasing amounts of disposable income , @entity3 's emergent middle class is viewed by the global automobile industry as a prize -- something reflected in the international interest in @entity11			1
" @entity3 's middle class has been expanding , " @entity27 , vice chairman , @entity28 , told @entity0			1
" they 'll increase domestic demand			0
we 'd like to offer our vehicles at reasonable prices			0
" as the event opens , some eyes are focused on the sports utility market , with @entity40 's @entity39 concept and @entity42 's @entity41 , a mini suv , rumored to be launched at @entity14 2014			1
high - end marques like @entity45 will also be displaying new cars , like its f - type coupe			2
however , it is the sub-four - meter compact sedans that are set to dominate the show this year			0
new cars for the @entity3 market aspiring to lure the growing middle classes include the 2014 @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , @entity58			1
these brands will be unveiled at the expo alongside the domestic @entity57 ( in partnership with @entity64 's @entity63 motors ) , @entity65 -- expected to be the most popular launch of the event -- and @entity71 's @entity69 and @entity70 hatchback models			0
with these new models , @entity71 , the @entity72 - based manufacturer , has undergone some radical overhauls of its design and technology processes -- including the inclusion of the company 's @entity79 engine -- in a bid to recapture lost market share			2
" these cars have been engineered for global markets , through global teams across @entity3 , the @entity90 and @entity91 to set new standards in their respective segments , " @entity83 , president of passenger vehicles , @entity85 , told reporters in @entity11			2
@entity55 , currently the country 's second - largest car manufacturer , will cut export figures to focus more on the domestic market and maintain market share			2
" based on market requirement , we will recalibrate our production between domestic and export market , " @entity98 , @entity99 's vice-president of marketing and sales , said in an interview with the country 's @entity103			0
" then , whenever there is a need , our investor , our global parent is committed to bringing in additional investment in terms of capacity ; but the additional 45,000 units added through re-engineering is enough to meet the demand in the short - term			1
" as @entity3 develops as an economic power and consumers become more sophisticated in their buying habits , analysts say that the automotive industry 's growth is slowing down			2
" the auto industry is facing significant headwinds on account of rising interest rates , increased fuel prices and reduced share of consumer wallet to discretionary purchases , " @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , told @entity0			0
" growth has been tepid in both two - and four - wheelers , and the majority of growth is attributed to entry level vehicles			0
" the @entity142 ( @entity142 ) said sales of passenger vehicles declined by 5.72 % during april - december 2013 , compared to the same period the previous year			0
@entity3 produced 2,029,589 vehicles in the first half of 2013 , according to figures released by the @entity148 , representing an 8.7 % decline over the same period the previous year			0
in comparison , the @entity150 , a country with around a quarter of the population , made 5,665,485			0
@entity155 , by far the world 's largest auto producer , manufactured 10,751,683 vehicles in the same period			0
@entity126 says that , while " major car companies are bullish on @entity3 and think the economy could change post-general elections , " he does not think that the @entity14 itself will provide an upturn in market sentiment			1
and while the automobile market might be in danger of stalling , @entity3 's sheer numbers mean that there are still thousands of new cars being introduced to @entity3 's already - congested roads every day			1
@entity11 recently stole @entity171 's crown as the world 's most polluted city , and lax environmental standards in domestically produced cars are considered partly to blame for @entity11 's poor air quality			0
alongside smog caused by traffic , congestion as well as high accident rates and fatalities in @entity3 's urban centers mean that cars are an increasing part of the difficulties of life in the subcontinent			1
@entity72 , the country 's financial capital , has attempted to address the issue with the recent addition of a nine - kilometer - long monorail			2
the line , which opened at the beginning of february , traverses the western @entity3 city and will offer respite to some commuters but much of the remainder of the country 's public transportation network is antiquated and overburdened , meaning that cars are increasingly the choice of the growing middle class .			1

the 12th @entity14 opens on february 7
compacts continue to dominate attention
auto market remains sluggish in @entity3 , but global manufacturers willing to bet on the long - term
@entity3 's *private* cars remain a big *contributor* to pollution and congestion woes
