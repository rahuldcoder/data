president @entity6 , responding to concerns over the use of military - style equipment during protests in @entity4 , @entity5 over the summer , is asking aides to prepare an executive order that would better track the weapons and gear flowing from the federal government to local police departments around the nation			1
the order , which he 's expected to preview monday afternoon during a meeting with law enforcement and local government officials , would mandate federal agencies review the way they provide @entity21 police with heavy equipment like tanks and aircraft			1
a report issued by the @entity26 found the vast majority of material coming from the @entity29 to police departments was n't military - style : it included office supplies , furniture and tents			2
but 4 % of the @entity34 's output to police departments is military grade , including 92,442 small arms , 5,235 humvees , 617 mine resistant vehicles and 616 aircraft			0
other agencies , including the @entity41 and the @entity42 , also provide police with equipment and funds			2
the executive action , which was described by @entity26 officials ahead of @entity6 's announcement , is the conclusion of a review process @entity6 launched in august following the heavily armed response to protesters in @entity4			1
images of tear - gassed filled streets patrolled by police in tanks sparked concern that local departments were treating citizens like enemy combatants			0
officials said following the reviews , agencies could require better tracking of the equipment that ends up with police , require training for officers , and mandate reviews following " significant " incidents in which the equipment is used			2
but officials said the president would n't tamp down on the flow of equipment from the @entity34 to police departments since the bulk of the gear is n't military grade			1
instead , they said @entity6 would convene a task force on policing , focused on combating crime while building public trust in local law enforcement agencies			0
@entity83 , the police commissioner of @entity84 , will head the panel			0
the @entity26 will also ask for $ 263 million to provide police departments with body cameras , which advocates say would provide a clearer picture of confrontations like the incident in @entity4 , in which a white police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager			1
the funds would also go toward training			0
as @entity26 tackles @entity4 tensions , what solutions will it find ?			0

@entity6 is *planning* an executive order on police militarization
concerns have been *expressed* about level of response to @entity4 protests
@entity6 wo n't call for end to flow of equipment to police department
