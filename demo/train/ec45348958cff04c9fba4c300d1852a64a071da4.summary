-- as the @entity1 approached , millions anxiously followed the news from two very different parts of the world about two very different women -- women whose lives somehow touched us , whose fate seemed , somehow , linked to all of us			2
the world held its breath when word came that secretary of state @entity11 was hospitalized in @entity12			1
the news arrived at a time when we were trying to absorb , with profound sadness , a seemingly unrelated drama unfolding thousands of miles away			0
in @entity23 , a 23 - year - old woman , a university student on her way home after watching a movie with her boyfriend , was brutally raped and beaten by a group of men			1
she later died from her injuries			0
the parallel stories point to a sharp divide in the worldwide struggle for women 's equality			1
while women have made major strides , in some cases reaching the pinnacle of power , the most fundamental human rights -- such as freedom to go outside without risking harassment and physical attack -- elude millions , and full equality remains an unreached goal for most			1
@entity44 : ' she could have been me ' @entity46 , one of the world 's most powerful women and an icon of the global fight for women 's equality , has returned home and doctors say they expect a full recovery			1
in @entity60 , the plight of an anonymous woman nicknamed " @entity57 , " @entity58 for dauntless , has become a turning point for the country			0
( that we do n't use @entity57 's real name proves the grotesque reality that being raped remains a source of shame for the victim			0
) @entity57 's ashes have been scattered , and it seems her death was not in vain			0
the attack sent tens of thousands of people -- men and women -- into @entity23 's streets and pulled the thick cover from @entity60 's unspeakable rape statistics			1
most rapes go unreported for good reason			0
of the more than 600 cases filed with the @entity23 police last year , only one resulted in conviction			1
powerless rape victims often resort to suicide			2
news : @entity46 's future ' as good as her past , ' docs say the contrast could not be sharper with the woman many call simply @entity11			1
speculation about whether she will run for president in 2016 is unending			0
the day she was hospitalized with a blood clot , we heard that she again came in first in @entity105 's @entity104 poll , finishing at the top for 11 years in a row and a total of 17 times since 1993 , more than anyone in @entity105 's history			0
she is probably the world 's best - known woman and unquestionably one of the most influential			2
but she is only one of many who have reached so far			0
women lead some of the globe 's biggest , most important countries			2
chancellor @entity119 heads the government of @entity121 , @entity118 leads @entity122 , @entity123 is president of @entity124 , and the list goes on			0
@entity127 voters just elected 20 women to the @entity129 , the largest number in history			0
and yet , that 's just 20 % of the seats			0
it 's sad we find this an accomplishment worth celebrating			0
the push for equality has unleashed push - back			2
rape , we are told , is about power			0
in traditional societies , men see improvements in the status of women as a challenge to their own			0
sexual assaults by gangs of self - congratulating , hyperventilating men , whether in @entity23 , in @entity151 's @entity150 or somewhere in @entity152 , amount to chest - pounding assertions of dominance from fearful , cowardly individuals			1
in countries with strong laws and changing attitudes about women , the number of rapes has been plummeting			2
opinion : end global rape culture then there are the murders and attempted murders			0
last year we saw @entity169 's @entity168 try to kill @entity170 , the 14 - year - old girl who demanded nothing more than the right to an education			1
and last month , in neighboring @entity175 , gunmen murdered @entity176 , the provincial director of women 's affairs			1
between the two extremes in women 's status , we have a much less dramatic -- but still crucial -- struggle			1
the women of @entity183 , who stood on the front lines of the revolution , will now have to live with a new constitution that commits the state to " preserve the genuine character of the @entity183 family " and vaguely notes the " duties of a woman toward her family , " opening the door to who - knows - what efforts by the state to keep women in their place			1
in the @entity127 , where progress is indisputable in so many areas , women still make , in the aggregate , 76 cents for every dollar men earn			2
inequality is pervasive in areas that are subtly important			0
despite having a female secretary of state , and even , possibly , a female secretary of defense on the horizon , @entity207 remains a " city of men , " as the writer @entity211 noted , with women woefully underrepresented in the corridors of power , in think tanks and in academia			2
women 's minds and ideas do n't receive an equal hearing on the national stage partly because , as one survey showed , only 20 % of all op - eds are written by women , and just 15 % of columns dealing with foreign policy and security issues			1
opinion : @entity229 @entity228 failed women on @entity231 every women walks on the path laid painstakingly and deliberately by people like @entity11 , or accidentally , tragically , by women like @entity57			1
the road to women 's equality , it turns out , is paved with potholes , quicksand and death traps			1
there is a reason so many feel a close connection to @entity11 and to @entity57			2
their stories , like those of 3 billion others , are of women seeking to make it in what is still today mostly a man 's world			1
as @entity46 recovers and as the people of @entity60 work to build a positive legacy from @entity57 's death , the obvious lesson is that much work remains ahead			0
strong headwinds will push against women 's progress , but progress can be achieved through urgent legislation , through patient education , and when necessary -- as it is now -- through mass protests and unrelentingly firm demands			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity269 .			0

@entity271 : @entity11 illness and @entity23 rape tell different stories about state of women
she says women 's equality faces sharp divide ; some *ascend* , most kept powerless
she says @entity183 's new constitution presents time - bomb for new *oppression* of women
@entity289 : progress for women needs strong legislation , education , sometimes protests
