-- " i guess you want to have a heart attack ? " that is the question you should ask yourself every time you put off taking a vacation			1
studies have shown that not taking vacations is linked to health problems			1
and if people skip vacations , there 's a chance that they may die younger than those who do n't			1
i think employers should be required to post warning labels in the workplace similar to those on cigarettes packs			0
i 'd love to see a big sign in the break room that reads : " warning : working too many weeks without a vacation is going to kill you			1
seriously , you are going to die from it			0
" we are all well aware that stress is harmful to our health			1
it causes problems ranging from ulcers to body aches to insomnia			1
vacations are one of the major antidotes to stress			1
travel : relax , it 's only a vacation one study found that men at high risk for coronary heart disease , and who failed to take annual vacations , were 32 % more susceptible to dying from a heart attack			1
another study compared women who vacationed at least twice a year to those who took one every six years or less			0
astoundingly , the women who did not vacation annually were almost eight times more likely to develop coronary heart disease or have a heart attack			2
as a nation , we are obsessed with work			1
some view taking a vacation as a sign of weakness			1
others who have n't vacationed in years see it as a badge of honor			2
and still others apologize for taking a vacation , as they feel guilty for taking time off even though they have earned it			1
the average @entity72 worker has 14 vacation days per year , but most only use 12 of those days			2
worse than that , about 25 % of @entity72 do n't take any vacation at all			1
the @entity72 is the only industrialized nation in the world that does not legally require workers to be provided a set number of paid vacation days			1
this is in stark contrast to @entity82 where the @entity83 mandates that workers be provided with 20 paid vacation days every year			2
anyone wants to guess which place has higher life expectancy : @entity72 or @entity82 ? @entity82 countries win , of course			0
in fact , the @entity72 is 28th in the world in life expectancy			0
if saving your life is n't enough of a reason to take a few vacations , here is another : people who take annual vacations are more productive			1
a 2010 study found that 35 % of @entity72 feel better about their job and are more productive after a vacation			2
vacations have been found to help us recharge -- we sleep better during them and for a period of time afterwards			2
and our brain responses become quicker after vacations			2
as difficult as it is for some to believe , working more hours does not necessarily translate to a better bottom line or higher productivity			1
for example , @entity114 work the most in @entity82 -- averaging 2,017 hours per year			2
yet , they are no better off as their economy is a wreck			0
now take a look at @entity119 -- @entity82 's economic powerhouse			0
i 'm sure some would guess that the @entity119 work longer hours			2
germans work on average 1,408 hours per year , placing them second to last among the 25 @entity82 nations in hours worked annually			2
they also receive on average 30 paid vacation days a year -- the most in @entity82			0
a vacation does n't have to be two weeks on the @entity129			1
it can be a trip to the @entity132 -- the real one , not the one with @entity133 and @entity134			0
" it could be a camping expedition or a few days in the mountains			0
Ã‚ the point is -- it could be as adventurous or low key as you want it to be			0
i have seen first hand the consequence of not taking regular vacations			1
my father -- the workaholic -- hated vacations			0
he refused to take them on annual basis			0
sadly , he passed away some years ago after his third open heart surgery at a much younger age than his peers			0
there 's no doubt that stress reduction -- such as yearly vacations -- could have extended his life			0
travel : readers share vacation planning tactics so if you 're thinking of skipping your vacation , it 's not too late to change your mind			0
you 'll feel better rested , healthier and more productive			0
or , you can choose to keep working non-stop like a hamster running on a wheel that keeps going faster and faster			0
until , finally , one day , you collapse , are carried off on a stretcher , and replaced by a similar looking creature			0
what 's it going to be ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			1

studies show not taking vacations is associated with health problems
@entity173 : as a nation , we are obsessed with work
he says working more does not necessarily mean a better bottom line
@entity173 : do n't apologize for taking your annual vacation
