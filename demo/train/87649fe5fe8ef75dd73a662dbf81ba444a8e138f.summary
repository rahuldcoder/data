@entity0 -- across the country , fans of the @entity3 are wondering whether @entity5 will return to top form this sunday , whether @entity8 's ankle will hold up , and whether cornerback @entity9 can shut down the @entity11 ' dangerous receivers			1
but here in @entity0 , folks ask still another question : will the @entity3 go out and win this one for @entity15 ? the passing of an owner 's wife is rarely a source of inspiration in professional sports , but the @entity3 have long thought that @entity22 was different			1
that 's why they have woven an insignia bearing her initials into their jerseys : she has been their talisman this season and will be for the season 's finale			2
a little bit of background helps to explain			2
@entity15 's husband , @entity36 , bought the @entity3 in 1994 when it was a broken - down , struggling franchise			1
since then , he has built it into one of the pre-eminent franchises in professional sports , with @entity15 as a close , constant partner			1
the @entity3 racked up victories on the shoulders of a topflight quarterback in @entity5 , an ingenious coach in @entity45 -- but they won the respect of others around the league in large part thanks to @entity36 's forthright leadership and @entity15 's heart of gold			1
in fact , as @entity36 once recalled to @entity52 , @entity15 was the one who balked when he was planning to buy the @entity3 for a then - record $ 172 million : " she was afraid it would affect our charitable giving			1
" @entity36 assured her , " we will do more for the community if we run this franchise correctly " -- and he was right			1
her contributions to humanity range from monumental gestures to everyday acts of kindness			0
she managed the @entity67 and @entity66 and the @entity68 , which contributed millions of dollars to charities across the @entity70 and in @entity71 , focusing on everything from education to poverty to cancer research			0
she headed the board of @entity77 of @entity78 and @entity79 and was the first woman to chair the @entity82 of @entity0			0
frequently , she opened their home to @entity71 studying at @entity85 on @entity87 fellowships			0
she and her husband also loved their large , boisterous family			0
a couple of years ago , the @entity90 invited one of us ( @entity94 along with wife @entity95 ) to join them for a seder dinner during @entity97			2
the room was crowded with almost three dozen children , grandchildren and friends			0
as the only @entity102 there , we were entranced as @entity36 asked every grandchild to read and @entity15 made each of us feel absolutely special			1
although married to a man who @entity107 lists with a net worth of $ 1.7 billion , @entity15 always made time to serve food in soup kitchens , to pack bags full of donated clothes , to bond with anyone around her			1
and she often persuaded @entity117 players to serve alongside her			0
former @entity3 running back @entity119 still remembers how much he enjoyed her chicken noodle soup			2
" i used to give @entity22 a kiss before every game , " 325 - pound defensive tackle @entity121 recalled to the @entity124			2
she mattered to the players so much that , following her death at age 68 in july , the whole team commissioned a painting in her memory and presented it to @entity36 in an emotional locker room ceremony celebrating a late - season victory			1
her memory also made the famously ice - cold @entity45 choke up in a radio interview			2
and she struck a deep chord with fans , too			0
one of the biggest ovations in the @entity138 came when someone held up 3 - foot - high cutouts of her initials for all of @entity142 to see			0
she rarely interceded in football operations , but fans happily recall how she nixed the drafting of a @entity146 linebacker with a criminal history of abusing women			0
with characteristic pluck and fearlessness , she advised @entity36 to dig deeper , and that was that -- the @entity3 waived their rights to the player almost immediately after the draft , a previously unheard - of move			1
and while she was already beset this past summer by cancer			0
her deep connection with her husband -- and the grief so widely shared upon her passing -- is credited by many around the league with helping end the lockout that threatened this @entity165 season itself			0
who will forget the timeless photo of the enormous @entity169 center @entity168 embracing @entity36 just days after @entity15 's death ? @entity22 was not a large woman			1
but as dr. @entity172 , president of @entity173 ( another nonprofit she supported vigorously ) , told the @entity124 , " as diminutive as her physical size was , it was in inverse proportion to the size of her heart and soul			0
" so that will be the legacy on the minds of the @entity3 -- and the cheering faithful -- as the team suits up this sunday			1
it 's a legacy that highlights the very best in football and brings out the very best in players			0
@entity193 of the @entity194 notes that at halftime in the last game of the regular season , with the @entity3 down 21 - 0 to the @entity198 , @entity36 asked an assistant to bring that painting of @entity15 down from his office and place it in their locker room			1
the team roared back , scoring 49 unanswered points			2
" @entity22 meant more to this than probably any of us that are playing this game , " @entity121 told the @entity124			2
" she 's the foundation			0
hopefully we can get it done for her			0
" the fans here in @entity3 are confident their team can			1
with a foundation that strong , they 're eager to see the @entity3 go out and win one for @entity15 -- and for the timeless values she championed			1
