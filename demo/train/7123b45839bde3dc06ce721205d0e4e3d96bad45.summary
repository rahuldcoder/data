-- among science fiction and fantasy , there are a genres and sub-genres : hard science , swords and sorcery , cyberpunk , steampunk , apocalyptic stories , time travel and space opera , just to name a few			2
each has its hardcore fans , and rarely do these stories stray from their roots by mixing elements			0
someone forgot to mention this to author @entity22			1
his new novel , " @entity24 , " defies classification as it incorporates elements across the sci - fi and fantasy spectrum			1
@entity22 has let his imagination run wild , with some fantastic results			1
" @entity24 , " out tuesday , is a sequel to @entity22 's equally impressive " @entity33			1
" both books take place in @entity36 as well as its parallel but not quite mirror image , the @entity33 , a version of @entity41 that exists in an alternate universe			1
the two versions of the city are linked together by a fissure , a fiery blue portal that allows characters to travel back and forth between universes			2
imagine being able to step into another world and meet a similar but slightly different version of yourself			0
if you ever watched the show " @entity54 , " you get the idea			0
@entity22 's " @entity33 " took place in a reimagined 1930s prohibition - era @entity58			1
" @entity24 " picks up in the 1950s			1
@entity61 is president , the communist " red scare " has swept the nation , and a secretive government group called @entity64 is preparing for war against an unknown enemy			0
now there 's trouble in the " other " @entity36			2
the fissure connecting the two worlds has flickered out , and the @entity33 is slowly dying			1
private eye @entity71 is pulled into a secret plot to reboot the fissure , reconnecting the two universes and hopefully saving his version of @entity36			1
all this while preventing a transdimensional invasion of killer robots			0
did i forget to mention the killer robots ? there are also costumed superheroes and villains , secret agents clad in black suits and a pair of mad scientists			2
there 's no shortage of plot or action in " @entity24 , " which echoes the pulp sci - fi genres that reached their height in 1930s comic books and noir detective fiction			1
@entity22 grew up in @entity95 watching " @entity97 " and listening to the @entity96			1
he now lives in @entity98 , where he 's hard at work on several upcoming projects			2
he recently talked to @entity0 about his new novel			0
the following is an edited transcript			0
@entity0 : what was the spark behind " @entity24 " ? @entity22 : even as i was writing " @entity33 , " i knew there were more adventures for the main character , private detective @entity71 , to have			1
i also knew that the world was far larger than what i 'd presented in book one			2
i 'm a big @entity36 history buff and had collected a whole lot of interesting stuff to use in a new story			0
as with @entity117 in " @entity33 , " i found a lot of real - life characters and places to use : @entity64 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , to name just a few			1
the nature of the universe also meant i could shuffle forward in time a few years , to the 1950s , which would let me write a different kind of story			0
if " @entity33 " is from the @entity128 of comic books , then " @entity24 " is the @entity130 , with all the craziness that entails			1
throw in some atomic robots , the @entity133 and an electric ghost , and i had my idea ! @entity0 : this novel and its prequel , " @entity33 , " are both a mix of pulp fiction , detective novel , superhero story , science fiction and fantasy			1
was it difficult to blend these genres ? @entity22 : both books were a lot of fun to write , but i never thought about genre or worried about getting everything to fit			1
i had the story , i had the characters , and it all just came together			0
it also just happened to have everything i love about science fiction and fantasy jammed together , but i think that 's part of the appeal of " @entity33			1
" " @entity24 " is a little more controlled			2
having introduced so many disparate elements in the first book , i could focus on telling a more linear sci - fi story in the second			1
it 's basically all just science fiction ... or should that be science fantasy ? @entity0 : you 've said you were a fan of " @entity97 " growing up			2
does the tv series remain an inspiration and what about other influences ? @entity22 : " @entity97 " is where my love of science fiction and fantasy started			1
i was introduced to it when i was 8 , and i 'm still an avid viewer			0
it still influences me in a way , as the original series ( my true love ) emphasized the importance of story and character over flashy special effects , which they had to , given the limitations of tv production in the 1960s and 1970s			0
but i think it taught me some good lessons about storytelling			0
i read a lot of science fiction , but i also mixed it up with a lot of other genres : crime , literary fiction , as well as nonfiction			0
@entity197 , i 'm a fan of @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 , among many others			0
comics are a hugely important part of my life , particularly crime and mystery comics ( including @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 ) and superhero comics ( both the @entity216 and @entity217 varieties )			0
i have to say i prefer television to film			0
we 're in a bit of a golden age of genre television , i think , with the likes of " @entity225 , " " @entity226 , " " @entity227 " and many others			0
not to mention an age of great tv writing , period ! just look at " @entity232 , " " @entity233 , " " @entity231 , " " @entity234			0
" the old writer 's advice to throw your tv out the window is looking more and more outdated			2
@entity0 : you 're originally from @entity95 , now living in the @entity240 and writing about the @entity58 have you tapped into a universal language among sci - fi fans ? @entity22 : there are similarities and differences , certainly			1
@entity95 seems to be somewhere in the middle , culturally , between the @entity240 and the @entity58 , which is possibly a useful foundation for me			0
i think you can tell the difference between @entity240 and @entity58 science fiction and fantasy , although it 's sometimes not something you can definitively put your finger on			2
it seems more obvious in other genres like crime			0
@entity240 crime novels are very different to @entity58 crime novels , which is a natural divergence , obviously , as crime and mystery are usually set in the here and now , and the @entity240 and @entity58 are different places , shared language and experience aside			0
my own writing has perhaps more of an @entity58 flavor than a @entity240 one , but that 's because the stories i 've so far written have needed it			2
" @entity33 , " " @entity273 " and " @entity24 " are all very place - centric , where the setting itself is almost a character			1
but there is a universality to story that is n't just limited to science fiction			0
@entity0 : what 's next ? will there be a sequel to " @entity24 " ? @entity22 : after my next novel for @entity283 , " @entity293 " -- an urban fantasy about ancient gods and serial killers in @entity296 -- comes my first novel from @entity285 , a dark space opera called " @entity287 , " which is about a forgotten war hero , a dead cosmonaut who never existed and a demon from @entity292 mythology			1
that hits in march 2014			0
i certainly have more to write in the world of " @entity33 " and " @entity24 , " but it 's a case of " watch this space " ! read an excerpt from " @entity24 "			1

@entity22 's new novel , " @entity24 , " spans the sci - fi and fantasy spectrum
the book picks up with @entity22 's previous novel , " @entity33 , " left off
