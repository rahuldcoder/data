@entity0 -- the @entity2 is expected to release results of the @entity4 on tuesday , the first look at how the country has changed over the last decade			1
" the @entity4 began last january in a remote corner of @entity11 and in the months that followed , @entity9 stepped up and achieved a successful @entity4 , " the bureau said on its website			1
" beginning this month , the nation will see the first results from the @entity4 as a new portrait of @entity9 begins to take shape			1
" the @entity9 @entity17 mandates that a @entity4 be conducted every 10 years to track population shifts in the country			1
its primary purpose is to determine how many people live in the @entity9 and which states will gain congressional seats and electoral votes and which states will lose them			2
but @entity4 population figures are also used to distribute federal funds to states and communities			1
the @entity4 form had 10 questions -- the shortest one in @entity9 history -- and surveyed some 134 million households either by mail or in person to collect the data			1
about 2 million @entity4 workers were hired for the job			1
about 74 percent of households returned the form , matching the rate in 2000 , according to the bureau			2
the new @entity4 numbers will be the basis for congressional reapportionment , as the states divvy up the 435 seats in the @entity49			1
the report will likely kick off a fight next year between @entity52 and @entity53 over redistricting , as states gaining or losing seats will have to draw new districts			0
but even most states which are assigned the same number of @entity49 seats may redraw the boundaries of their congressional districts to make each one roughly equal when it comes to population			2
in states where one party dominates , the redistricting process could give that party an advantage , and the results could have a big impact on the 2012 battle for control of @entity74			0
the @entity4 numbers could also have a big impact on the next race for the @entity78 , as some states will gain or lose electoral votes , and thus influence over the outcome of the next presidential race			2
@entity83 is expected to be a big winner in the process			0
an estimate by @entity87 , a political consulting firm that specializes in redistricting , suggests that @entity83 will likely gain four congressional seats , with @entity90 adding as many as two , and @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , and @entity97 possibly each gaining a seat			0
according to the estimate , @entity99 and @entity100 could be the big losers , with each state likely losing two seats			0
@entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , and @entity111 may each lose a seat			0
it is expected that @entity114 will remain steady at 53 seats , the largest congressional state delegation in the country			0
