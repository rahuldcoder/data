keep your carry - ons small on @entity3 flights			1
starting wednesday , if your bag does n't fit under the seat , you 're going to pay for it			1
the airline plans to charge between $ 10 and $ 30 for carry - on luggage stored in overhead bins on flights booked after the fee is implemented overnight			1
those prices apply for fees paid during the reservation process and vary by route			0
previous bookings will not be affected			0
carry - on fees on most routes will be less than $ 15 , the airline said			1
passengers who pay fees at the airport during check - in will be charged $ 35			2
personal items that fit under seats are still free			2
@entity3 's ceo said the airline 's fares are still lower than competitors '			2
" when it is all said and done and you get to the bottom line and hit the ' pay ' button , and you can shop our fares against anybody else			0
we are typically 50 % lower , " ceo @entity37 said			0
rising fuel prices are to blame for the hefty fee , says one industry expert			2
" @entity3 has one of the oldest and most fuel - inefficient fleets in the airline industry , " said @entity45 , an analyst with @entity46			1
@entity3 joins @entity47 as the second @entity49 carrier to implement fees for carry - on luggage			1
in april 2010 , @entity47 announced carry - on charges from $ 20 to $ 45 for bags stored in the overhead bins			1
spirit declined to comment tuesday on revenue generated by its carry - on fee , but the policy has been " very well received by our customers and our crew members , " spokeswoman @entity55 said via e-mail			1
" it has resulted in a much speedier , smoother and safer boarding and deplaning			0
" overall , @entity49 airlines racked up $ 2.6 billion in baggage fee revenue in 2011 , according to the @entity67			2
an ultra-low - fare model gives carriers such as @entity3 and spirit more flexibility in unbundling the costs of air travel , @entity45 said , but other airlines will be watching the carry - on fee closely			1
" they 're all trying to move that route , but it 's a little harder for the higher - cost network airlines to tack on higher fees associated with getting passengers from a to @entity81 , " @entity45 said			0
but " if they think they can get away with it , they 're going to do it			0
" @entity87 , founder of @entity88 , agrees			0
" it 's a distinct possibility			0
monkey see , monkey do			0
clearly , @entity47 did n't go bust for doing so , and now @entity3 is dipping its toes into the water , " @entity87 said via e-mail			1
" since there 's no regulation banning such a fee , and especially because overhead bin space has not kept up with demand from passengers trying to avoid fees ( leading to countless fights and unpleasantness for both passengers and crew ) i do n't see why at least one legacy carrier would n't try it			0
" @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 said tuesday that they have no plans to charge for carry - ons			1
@entity114 said it does n't comment on future fares or fees .			0
