@entity0 -- an investigation into the mysterious 2009 crash of @entity6 into the southern @entity7 will also include a probe into @entity9 , the airline 's attorney said friday			1
a @entity11 magistrate already is investigating @entity12 for involuntary manslaughter in connection with the crash , according to the airline manufacturer and a court spokeswoman			1
however , @entity18 , the attorney for @entity9 , said he does n't know why the airline is part of the investigation			2
he said the magistrate is looking into a problem involving pitot tubes , which measure a plane 's air speed			2
still , " there is nothing new in this case and there is no proof that the pitot tubes caused the crash , " @entity18 told @entity1			0
judge @entity33 is presiding over the inquiry into the @entity12 - made plane , court spokeswoman @entity32 told @entity1 on thursday			1
the plane fell into the sea while traveling from @entity38 to @entity0 , killing all 228 people aboard			1
@entity40 , ceo of @entity12 , disagreed with the decision to commence the investigation			2
" on behalf of @entity12 , i have noted the absence of facts supporting this step and stated our strong disagreement , " @entity40 said in a written statement			2
" @entity12 maintains that the focus should be on finding the cause of this accident and making sure it can never happen again			0
@entity12 will continue to support the investigation , including the continued search for the flight recorders , which is the only sure way to know the truth , " he said			0
investigators have not yet established what caused the crash , and large parts of the plane -- including both flight recorders -- have never been found , despite an extensive search operation that included a @entity11 navy submarine			1
the plane went down in stormy weather , and most of the bodies were never recovered			0
studies of the debris and bodies that were found led @entity11 's air accident investigation agency , the @entity74 , to conclude the plane hit the water belly first , essentially intact			1
oxygen masks were not deployed , indicating that the cabin did not depressurize , the @entity74 revealed in a 2009 report			0
automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring air speed , the investigators said , though they said that alone was not enough to cause the disaster			0
the area where the plane went down is far out in the @entity7 -- two to four days by ship from the nearest ports in @entity93 or @entity94 in @entity95			1
the rough underwater terrain includes mountains and valleys , the @entity74 said			0
@entity1 's @entity99 contributed from @entity100 .			0
