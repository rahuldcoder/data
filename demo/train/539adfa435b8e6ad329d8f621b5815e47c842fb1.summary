-- @entity2 's legislative council had heard enough : residents complaining about loud gunfire , the @entity5 town 's small police station inundated with phone calls from frightened residents			1
so , a few months ago , they tried to restrict when and where residents could shoot their guns in an effort to quiet the complaints			0
instead , they got an earful from gun - control opponents			1
today , there 's a much deeper debate over gun rights in @entity2 and around the country in the wake of friday 's massacre at @entity2			1
and the battle line in that debate runs straight through towns such as the once - sleepy @entity5 community			0
" it 's a town with a longstanding history and cultural tradition of guns , " explained council member @entity28			0
@entity2 's longstanding gun culture manifested itself as a family outing for @entity35 , 20 , who authorities say shot and killed his mother -- who introduced him to target shooting -- before killing 20 children and six adults at the elementary school and then taking his own life			1
for several years , @entity35 and his mother frequented several gun ranges in the area , according to federal authorities			2
that 's nothing out of the ordinary in this @entity5 town , where shooting sports are a popular pastime			2
" in @entity2 right now , you can shoot any gun at anytime on your property , " said town police commission member @entity55			1
lawmakers seem prepared to tackle gun control the commission 's attempt earlier this year to curb the city 's lax attitude toward gun use was stonewalled by gun - control opponents in august , which @entity55 said he could n't understand			1
" all we wanted to do was make sure that all the guns that are fired in @entity2 are fired in a safe fashion and are n't going to injure anybody and are n't going to infringe on anybody else 's property and create a danger , " @entity69 explained			1
" even that safety - based solution was staunchly and vigorously opposed by gun rights individuals			2
" it shows just how sensitive the debate over gun control can be in @entity2 -- and the nation			1
but what about now ? has the climate for gun control changed in the wake of friday 's horrible attack ? might @entity89 's gun culture change as a result of what happened at @entity2 ? " i would hope so , " @entity55 says			1
" the time has come now for people to be reasonable			0
it 's unreasonable not to have a safety ordinance about where you 're going to have a shooting range			2
if that ca n't pass , i mean , what can pass ? " gun - control opponents say even small restrictions represent a slippery slope that threatens @entity104 constitutional rights			1
" you can make as many laws as you want it will not change people who want to hurt others , " said @entity0 commenter @entity106			0
" we all need to arm ourselves now			0
that is the only way			0
" another @entity0 commenter , @entity115 , disagrees			0
he suggests the nation should " start by banning all assault weapons			0
you do n't need them unless you want to be the next mass shooter ! " these comments and other similarly entrenched positions on both sides of the debate show that gun rights are connected with deep - seated moral issues for many @entity127 , explained constitutional expert @entity128			1
" just as some people believe there can be absolutely no restrictions on the @entity138 right of freedom of speech and of the press , some other people take a similar view to the @entity104 about the right to bear arms , " said @entity128 of the @entity132 - based think tank @entity130			0
" at the other end of the spectrum , some advocates of gun prohibition view the idea of owning guns to defend yourself as intrinsically immoral			2
" analysis : guns and the law in @entity155 , the gun - control issue has lain virtually dormant for years since a 1994 federal ban on semi-automatic assault rifles elapsed in 2004			1
but that was before friday			0
@entity2 has lit a legislative flame			2
sen. @entity161 has vowed to introduce new legislation banning weapons such as the @entity2 gunman 's @entity165 rifle			2
" six - year - olds with three to 11 bullets from this bushmaster in their body			0
is this @entity127 ? i do n't think so , " said @entity161			0
" and i think these incidents are going to continue until we do something to change the supply mode of these weapons out in our society			0
" the @entity179 @entity178 said her bill will propose banning " the sale , the transfer , the importation , and the possession " of such weapons			0
@entity161 , who helped champion the 1994 ban , said she and her staff have looked at the initial bill and tried to " perfect it			0
" even sen. @entity191 , a conservative @entity178 and self - described " proud gun owner , " said the @entity2 massacre should be the tipping point in the debate over limiting gun rights			1
a new @entity199 / @entity198 survey taken shortly after friday 's shooting in @entity2 suggests that @entity127 attitudes are already shifting			1
according to the survey , 44 % of @entity127 now strongly support stricter gun laws , with 32 % opposed			0
that 's the first time in five years of @entity199 / @entity198 polling where significantly more people favor rather than oppose stricter gun - control measures			1
and for the first time in surveys dating back to 2000 , less than 50 % of respondents said the best way to reduce gun violence is to enforce existing laws , a common mantra for those who oppose gun restrictions			0
the number of people who say the best way to cut gun violence is to pass new laws has risen to 32 % , the highest level in an @entity199 / @entity198 poll since 2000			0
in the months and years ahead , @entity2 will become a symbol -- not for its rolling hills or for being " nicer " than other busy parts of the @entity225 -- but for the worst tragedy ever imaginable			2
it will join that dark list of names , such @entity229 , or even @entity230 , the @entity231 town where a gunman killed a teacher and 16 students who were about the same age as those in @entity2			1
in @entity237 , say " the @entity243 , " and most folks will immediately think of the horrific slaughter of 35 people by a man with a semi-automatic rifle			2
both of those 1996 massacres in @entity230 and @entity243 sparked widespread outrage that led to restrictions on weapons			1
twelve days after @entity243 , @entity237 's prime minister announced gun reforms			1
high - caliber rifles and shotguns were banned and other restrictions were enacted			0
@entity230 sparked a national anti-gun campaign and petition drive that resulted in a @entity257 ban on the private ownership of handguns			2
the question is : will the outrage over @entity2 have similar results ? after shooting , cops take no - tolerance approach to copycat threats @entity0 's @entity267 and @entity268 contributed to this report			1

before friday 's attack , @entity2 considered *regulating* *outdoor* shooting ranges
expert : gun - control advocates and opponents see it as a moral issue
@entity2 will enter gun - control *lexicon* like @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity243
