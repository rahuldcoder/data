-- another day , another mass shooting in @entity2			0
more blood , more tears , more knee - jerk rhetoric about finding a solution for a bunch of different problems			1
those who knew @entity10 -- the shooter who killed 12 and injured eight more at the @entity13 this week -- said he was a quiet , shy man			1
at one point he was studying @entity15 and meditated often			0
a little more digging , and we find he had several gun - related arrests and a pattern of misconduct in the @entity21 , but he was honorably discharged			1
pieces of a puzzle we may never fully put together			0
but the fact that there is still so much we do n't know about @entity10 -- or the motive behind the shootings -- wo n't detour gun - control advocates from lumping his story in with that of @entity33 , the man police say is responsible for the massacre at @entity35 , along with the victims from gang - and drug - related shootings			1
this is why after the tears have dried and the blood washes away , little , if anything , will change			0
and because gun - control advocates so often try to cobble together every distinct narrative involving guns into a one - size - fits - all conversation , they are as much to blame for this @entity48 as the gun lobbyists against whom they fight			1
gun shops are illegal in @entity52			2
opinion : what could have prevented carnage ? the city has bans on both assault weapons and high - capacity magazines			2
and yet each week people continue to die in the streets from gunshot wounds			0
this conundrum is just one example why making note that more @entity2 have died from gun violence here at home since @entity35 than in the nine years fighting a war in @entity70 is the kind of factoid that grabs our attention but undermines the true goal : curtailing the violence			1
not all deaths involving guns are the same -- therefore trying to address each incident from the same point of view is futile			0
until we learn more about @entity10 -- the events leading up to the shootings and the motive -- the tragedy in @entity85 should not be used as catalyst for a conversation about gun control			1
instead , we should mourn and wait for more information			2
far too often assumptions surrounding the details of tragedies such as the one in @entity85 are made , and well - intentioned stances fall apart when additional facts come to light			2
the guns @entity98 was charged with using in @entity99 were purchased legally			0
beyond the presence of a gun , the crimes committed in the movie theater are not at all similar to what happens in the streets of our large cities			2
and each time a politician or gun - control advocate tries to use these two very different examples interchangeably , the entire conversation and argument are compromised			1
and it will keep continue to happen until the advocates accept that ridding the country of guns is a hopeless -- and unconstitutional mission -- and that the real goal should be addressing the factors that lead to the various forms of gun violence : factors such as poverty , mental health and failing schools			1
last month the nation breathed a sigh of relief after @entity131 , a bookkeeper in an elementary school in suburban @entity133 , prevented a man with an @entity136 - type weapon and nearly 500 rounds of ammunition from hurting anyone			2
it was not the time to talk generally about gun violence in this country			1
it was the time to discuss specifics such as cuts to mental health and its impact on services , given that the suspect , 20 - year - old @entity150 , has a long history of mental disorders			2
@entity150 's storyline is similar to that of @entity33 , and there are questions whether @entity98 , the admitted shooter in the @entity99 movie theater , is insane			0
public debates with @entity161 and attacks on the @entity163 have proven to be an ineffective way to prevent gun violence			1
in the wake of the @entity13 killings , perhaps a new strategy , one that does n't involve playing on the nation 's emotions or challenging the relevance of the @entity173 , should be employed			1
that 's not saying the @entity163 has won -- in fact , i think @entity161 should step down because each time he opens his mouth , he steps in it -- but at the end of the day the organization is more of an agitator than the enemy			0
there is no one enemy			0
thus there is no one solution			0
because like it or not , the folks spraying our cities with bullets are not @entity163 members or legal gun owners			0
and despite the tendency to tie it all together , they have nothing to do with the @entity196 of the world			0
and it 's too early to know how @entity10 fits in the conversation			0
according to a count by @entity202 , more than 900 people have been killed in mass shootings since 2006			0
the thousands of other victims of gun violence over the past seven years died from many different circumstances , requiring different conversations			1
this is why gun - control advocates need to abandon the routine of using mass shootings to turn law - abiding citizens into social pariahs and instead focus on something that could work			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			2

@entity218 : we *'re* hearing more knee - jerk rhetoric about gun - control measures
he says there 's not enough information about @entity13 shootings to figure out solutions
more gun - control measures are *unrealistic* and wo n't prevent the carnage , he says
@entity218 : many different factors lead to gun violence
