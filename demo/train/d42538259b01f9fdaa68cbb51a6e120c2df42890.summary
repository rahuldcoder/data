the @entity1 @entity0 refused friday to stop the pending release of thousands of @entity4 inmates to solve chronic , severe overcrowding in the state prisons			1
the unsigned order is the latest chapter in a long - running federal lawsuit by prisoners and their advocates against what they called dangerous and unacceptable conditions in 30 state correctional institutions			2
a judge 's order in may required the state to further reduce the prison population by 9,600 inmates by year 's end			1
the state has repeatedly cited public safety in resisting the mandated releases			0
the state in recent days asked the @entity0 for an injunction to delay implementation of the order			1
the high court in 2011 upheld an earlier order setting limits on the prison population and a timetable for the state to follow to meet that ceiling			2
justices @entity35 , @entity37 , and @entity38 said they would have granted the stay requested by the state			1
@entity35 , in a toughly worded dissent , called the original release order a " terrible injunction " and suggested the result would be that many of the released prisoners will commit more crimes			1
@entity4 to challenge court order to release 10,000 inmates by year 's end there was no immediate reaction from gov. @entity53 , but he had called the earlier mandate " unprecedented			1
" a three - judge federal court panel ordered the state to reduce its prison population to 137.5 % of design capacity by december 31 and threatened to find the state in contempt if it did not report on its progress every two weeks			0
until recently , @entity4 had the nation 's largest prison system and officials have said they have been reducing overcrowding			1
the case grows out of lawsuits filed in 1990 and 2001 that alleged overcrowding is at the core of a domino effect of unsafe and unhealthy conditions for those on both sides of the iron bars			2
in 2011 , the @entity1 @entity0 upheld the federal panel 's determination that @entity4 's medical and mental health care for inmates fell below a constitutional level of care and that the only way to meet the requirement was by reducing prison crowding			1
the justices two years ago found " continuing injury and harm resulting from these serious constitutional violations , " including as many as 156,000 people crammed in correctional facilities designed to hold about half that many			0
justice @entity91 at the time noted " needless suffering and death have been the well - documented result			0
over the whole course of years during which this litigation has been pending , no other remedies have been found to be sufficient			0
" federal judges in may expressed impatience with @entity4 officials , the defendants in the case			0
they threatened to cite the state with contempt if it did not comply with the release orders			0
the larger issue is a classic battle over state versus federal authority , focusing on whether @entity1 courts can step in and essentially run state prisons when officials have repeatedly violated basic constitutional guarantees afforded inmates			1
the competing arguments amount to a sharply divided debate between public safety concerns and individual rights , a debate that goes into how the three branches of government should balance competing state interests			0
@entity38 had dissented from the 2011 ruling , and warned any mass release of inmates to alleviate overcrowding would be " gambling with the safety of the people of @entity4			1
" prison overcrowding is a nationwide problem , but @entity4 's dilemma is unique in its massive scope and time frame			2
a special federal court in 2009 ordered the state to shrink the prison population from 202 % over capacity to a maximum of 137.5 % , and to accomplish that in two years			0
the state was given wide latitude to meet the goal , but the court was adamant the state do it without delay and without excuse			0
the current high court appeal is @entity151 ( @entity152 )			0
