-- at @entity1 of @entity2 at an altitude of 7,200 meters , an @entity5 woman , 50 - year - old @entity4 , sits in a solitary tent			1
outside , fierce winds of more than 50 knots are raging			0
soon blizzard - bearing monsoon clouds will gather around @entity2 and bring an end to the climbing season on the high @entity13			1
it will also draw a shroud over one of the single deadliest tragedies the world 's highest mountain has ever witnessed			2
before she can make begin her ascent , @entity4 must not only find a gap in the weather and a way over the avalanche , but also face down the growing controversies that erupted around continued activity on @entity2 in the wake of the disaster			1
more than 300 international climbers abandoned their goal of reaching the mountain 's summit after an april 18 avalanche in the mountain 's treacherous @entity34 killed 16 @entity38 sherpa mountaineers			1
the immediate aftermath of the disaster brought confusion and anger to the mountain as arguments raged over whether climbing should continue , the money paid to sherpas and compensation for the sacrifices made			1
after avalanche , @entity38 opens up unclimbed peaks domino effect some sherpas called an unofficial moratorium on further climbs , with one group even reportedly sabotaging equipment			2
with safety in doubt , many international climbing companies decided to pull the plug , leading to a domino effect that also swept up the independent climbers who rely on shared resources			2
" if 30 % of your workforce walks away , it compromises your operational capabilities , given the difficulties of finding new porters , cooks , and guides in short time in the @entity34 , " said one guide from a leading operator			0
many were resigned to the sudden end to the season			1
" i feel very sad about the @entity53 , " said @entity77 , an adventure operator from @entity79			1
" everybody knows each other ; it is a small community and their loss is very tangible			0
it takes a small amount of empathy to let go of one 's frustration			0
" @entity4 , however , stayed			1
later she was joined by @entity90 , a 41 - year - old @entity92 woman also determined to press ahead with an attempt on the summit			2
despite their determination in the face of calls for a halt to climbing , many @entity95 spoke to were not unhappy with their plans			2
instead , they voiced other concerns , including the disparity they perceive between local and international guide salaries , overcrowding on the mountain , a lack of respect to their mountain god and those who died			1
there was also anger towards the @entity38 government over its response to the tragedy			2
among the @entity2 climbing community questions were raised about the safety prior to the deaths			1
some sherpas said there had been too many on the mountain on the day of the disaster , with long lines forming as people traversed the ladders over crevasses			1
mourning in an @entity129 village ' one mistake and you are done ' " it was so packed that for some , there was no place to hide when the ice started to fall , " one said			0
" we never saw so many people on the icefall on one day			0
" one expert expressed strong concerns about renewed climbing			2
" the mountains are in constant movement , which is what makes the icefall dangerous , " said @entity143 , of the @entity145 high - altitude research center , located at 5,050 meters on @entity2			2
" you have to consider that in two months of expeditions , some sherpas spend an average of three hours daily on the icefall to carry their load			0
for some that is 200 hours in a very dangerous place			0
" veteran expedition leader @entity156 , however , said he was surprised that more did not defy the exodus to take advantage of conditions similar to those when @entity160 and sherpa @entity161 first summited in 1953			0
" hard - core mountaineers would jump at the chance to have @entity2 and @entity164 all for themselves during the best climbing season , " he says			1
" but being there without backup is like being back in epic @entity160 's time : one mistake and you are done			0
" back at @entity1 , in her gale - battered tent , @entity4 is convinced she is doing the right thing by continuing with her plan to summit @entity164 , a peak connected to @entity2 's @entity176 she says she knows the family of one of the victims and when she visited them after the disaster was not met with hostility and was invited to stay for the funeral			1
" i asked them if they felt it would be disrespectful if i continued with my climbing plan , " she says			0
" they were concerned about my safety , but they never brought up the issue of respect			0
" @entity4 , who is on a personal mission to climb all 14 of the world 's mountains over 8,000 meters , says the problem lies with assisted climbing			1
" high mountains are dangerous , and climbing is all about the experience			0
you have to evaluate the risks			0
but @entity2 has become a completely different place : it is a showtime place			2
people come here to make silly records			0
@entity5 climber recounts how @entity129 saved his life climbing in isolation " this is not real mountaineering			0
to me , if you can not free climb a mountain and you need someone else to help you up or down , you do n't belong on it			2
" @entity4 hits out at claims that @entity53 had forced people to abandon the mountain saying they had treated her well			1
she also speaks of the excitement of climbing in isolation			0
" i am very much looking forward to experiencing the mountain for what it is , without the crowds			0
it will be rewarding to be in contact with nature -- to hear the cracking of the ice and not the generators			0
" when at last the gales ease , it is finally time for @entity4 to face the mountain , but she is ultimately unable to reach her goal			1
because of the dangers on the @entity238 , both @entity4 and @entity90 bypass it using helicopters -- a highly controversial move that could invalidate any claim to a successful climb			1
@entity90 reaches the summit of @entity2 on may 23 along with five sherpas			1
@entity4 , however , decides to abandon her attempt on @entity164 because " that would be like claiming a whole mountain when i would only have climbed half of it			1
" shortly afterward , the monsoon closes in for good , leaving @entity2 to brood alone over another season of triumphs for some and tragedies for others			1
