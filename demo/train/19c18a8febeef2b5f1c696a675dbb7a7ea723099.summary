@entity1 , @entity0 -- it 's official : @entity4 is @entity5 enemy number one			1
in the span of a year , @entity4 has transformed himself from a little - known @entity8 candidate into the face of a government shutdown that has roiled @entity12 politics and raised questions about the viability of the @entity16 political process			1
democrats are now raising his profile at every turn , in political campaigns from @entity20 to @entity21 , casting him as a right wing zealot and hoping to hang the controversial tea party icon around the necks of every @entity27 office - seeker in the country			1
cruz : use debt ceiling debate for leverage the first - term @entity32 senator , a shrewd and often shameless promoter of stand - your - ground conservatism , is currently starring in a slew of television ads , talking points and a raft of fundraising emails attacking @entity27 over the ongoing government shutdown			1
far from being an object of fear , @entity4 is a welcome newcomer for @entity5 -- the embodiment of what they claim is dangerous tea party obstructionism , and a far more useful villain than @entity47 , @entity48 or any of the buttoned - up regulars straight out of @entity51 central casting			1
@entity52 targeting key republicans over shutdown @entity4 might be responsible for pushing the @entity16 government to the apogee of dysfunction , but for @entity5 operatives charged with winning elections , any @entity4 is good news			1
" it 's not that we 're making @entity4 a bogeyman , " said @entity61 , the communications director for the @entity52			2
" it 's that @entity27 are making him their leader			0
we 're more than happy to have a debate with them over whether that 's a good thing for the country or not			0
" with helpful prodding from top democrats in the nation 's capital , the " debate " over @entity4 is playing out in races around the country , far from the halls of the @entity77			0
when @entity81 , a @entity27 @entity82 candidate in southern @entity83 , made a sympathetic remark about @entity4 during a speech to the @entity86 last week , operatives from the @entity80 in @entity12 quickly packaged the clip and circulated it to local reporters under the slug : " @entity81 's model legislator : @entity4			1
" in the @entity94 mayor 's race , long shot @entity27 nominee @entity91 said in a radio interview that he favored delaying the @entity97 's individual insurance mandate by a year			0
the campaign of @entity100 @entity99 immediately turned their cannons on @entity91 , accusing him of " marching in lockstep with @entity27 extremists like @entity4			2
" @entity105 : the startling @entity2 poll across the @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity5 @entity8 candidate @entity108 name - dropped @entity4 during an attack on his @entity27 opponent tuesday			1
' the @entity4 strategy ' and over the past two weeks , strategists working for the @entity115 have been carpet - bombing local reporters in @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity0 with statements accusing @entity27 @entity8 candidates in those states of supporting " the @entity4 strategy " of political brinksmanship			1
the @entity32 also appears in a pair of new television ads about the shutdown from @entity132 and @entity133 , the @entity82 's political operation			0
@entity12 's warm bath of celebrity and self - interest then there 's @entity139 , the well - funded @entity5 research group that launched a cheeky website , " @entity141 , " after reports surfaced that the @entity32 senator was brazenly advising @entity145 members from across the @entity51 before the shutdown began			1
the website depicts @entity4 telling an anguished @entity48 , " i got it from here , bud			1
" " @entity4 is a powerful tool for democrats for the same reasons he 's so popular among the @entity27 base : he 's perfectly emblematic of where today 's @entity27 is and where it 's headed , " said @entity150 , a spokesman for @entity139			2
" the tea party loves him for leading the @entity27 into this shutdown , but the vast majority of @entity16 see it as the disaster it truly is			0
" nowhere has this theory been put to the test more than in the @entity0 governor 's race , where @entity4 chewed up more than a week 's worth of campaign oxygen in the closely watched contest between @entity27 @entity169 and @entity100 @entity170			1
@entity4 promises @entity27 victory in shutdown fight after the government lurched toward shutdown last week , @entity5 were handed a well - timed gift : @entity4 had been previously booked to deliver the keynote address at a conservative gala in @entity1 where , as it happened , @entity169 was also scheduled to speak			1
@entity170 's campaign cut a television and radio ad binding the two republicans together , just as the @entity183 who take home a federal paycheck were bracing for furloughs and service cutbacks			0
" look who 's coming to @entity0 this weekend , " a stern - sounding narrator intoned on the radio ad , which was still on the air as of this week			0
" @entity4 , the @entity27 senator from @entity32 who is the leader of the government shutdown			1
@entity4 is coming in to campaign for another radical @entity27 , @entity169			2
" the @entity5 of @entity0 launched a similar broadside , blitzing households with robocalls admonishing @entity169			2
@entity139 got in on the act , too , creating a " @entity197 " petition demanding that @entity169 not appear with the @entity32			0
@entity198 : @entity12 crisis could jump - start case for reform an uncomfortable position forget that @entity169 , himself a tea party darling , was technically not holding a campaign event with @entity4			2
the onslaught put @entity169 in a vise grip , drowning out his message and putting him in the awkward position of demanding an end to the government stalemate while dodging questions about @entity4 's role in the @entity216 drama			1
when @entity169 finally did speak at the @entity218 dinner on saturday night , he made only a passing reference to the shutdown and made no mention of @entity4 , one of the @entity27 's biggest stars who happened to be waiting backstage only a few yards away			1
he slipped out the @entity224 in a hurry , well before @entity4 took the stage			0
aside from surveys that show the shutdown to be deeply unpopular , the blame - it - on - @entity4 strategy is , at the moment , more of a safe bet than a poll - tested message			2
polls show a vast majority of @entity16 disapprove of the shutdown , and a @entity2 / @entity239 poll on monday showed @entity27 in @entity77 shouldering slightly more of the blame for the stalemate than @entity5 or president @entity242			2
yet while @entity16 seem to have clear opinions on the shutdown , @entity4 is a much less defined figure			0
in a poll from @entity247 released last week , almost 60 % of @entity16 said they did not know enough about @entity4 to have an opinion about him			0
among those who did , opinions were slightly more negative than positive			0
democrats working on the @entity0 governor 's race tested @entity4 's name in a focus group with roughly 30 undecided voters race this past weekend , according to a person familiar with the session , which was held in the @entity12 suburbs where the shutdown 's impact is felt most acutely			1
according to the source , @entity4 was not a well - known personality among the voters			0
but when the @entity5 operatives described @entity4 as a tea party leader with a prominent role in the shutdown , and said he was appearing with @entity169 at the gala saturday night , impressions of both men soured among the focus group participants			1
some @entity27 pragmatists , already worried that emboldened conservative hard - liners are tarnishing the party 's brand , acknowledge that @entity5 appear to have found a potent weapon in @entity4			1
@entity278 , a 26 - year veteran of @entity119 politics who managed @entity282 's presidential campaign in the battleground state , said bluntly that " swing voters are repelled by @entity4			0
" opinion : will glitches derail @entity97 ? little personal downside for @entity4 but there is little personal downside in the high stakes fight for @entity4 , an in - demand figure on the conservative speaking circuit who has designs on the 2016 @entity27 presidential nomination			2
having a @entity5 bulls eye on his back only boosts his stature on the right , @entity278 argued			0
" it 's an interesting strategy that works to the benefit of @entity5 who want to attach his brand to the @entity27 at a time when he 's underwater in approval ratings , but it also works to @entity4 's benefit because it elevates him with the @entity27 base , " he said			1
@entity310 , a @entity311 - based @entity27 strategist , said @entity4 is custom - built for today 's political environment , in which political leaders are often rewarded for combat and punished for compromise			2
" the base loves him , he 's become the @entity317 , and he 's raising major bank , " @entity310 said			0
" this is the @entity16 of @entity320 , and he 's making his bones , fast			0
" @entity4 's white - hot profile could easily fade in the coming months , well before the 2014 midterm cycle begins in earnest			0
but the @entity27 has shown a remarkably canny ability to maneuver his way into the national conversation			0
as long as @entity4 remains in the spotlight , @entity5 have plans to use him to their advantage			2
" right now , @entity4 and the tea party has become a synonym for the problem , and we 're going to continue to use that against the @entity27 who voted with him , " said one national @entity5 strategist working on a number of @entity82 races			1
" how big that will be next year , the verdict is still out on that			0
" is shutdown a sorry spectacle or shock treatment ?			0

@entity5 cast @entity4 as right wing zealot , hope to hang him around every @entity27 office - seeker
" we 're more than happy to have a debate with them " over @entity4 , @entity5 operative says
