-- with the 20th anniversary of " friends " coming up in september , this might be the best cast reunion we 're going to get			1
on " @entity7 " wednesday night , host @entity5 concocted a small get - together between @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
with @entity9 as his guest , @entity5 admitted to being a huge " friends " follower in the ' 90s -- so much so that he 's even written some fan fiction			2
in @entity5 's version of the @entity19 sitcom , he 's @entity20 , and @entity24 ( @entity9 ) , @entity21 ( @entity10 ) and @entity22 ( @entity23 ) ca n't stop talking about his impressive " lovemaking			1
" it may sound dumb -- especially since @entity21 and @entity20 were siblings on " friends " -- but as @entity5 replied to @entity9 's criticism , " is it dumber than living in a huge apartment in @entity32 for eight years , even though you work at a coffee shop ? " point taken			2
before long , @entity9 and @entity5 's re-enactment of " friends " -- on a replica of the set , no less -- was boosted by the appearances of @entity10 and @entity11			1
where were their male co-stars , @entity44 ( who played @entity45 ) and @entity46 ( who played @entity47 ) ? @entity5 had them killed off			1
but as the 20th anniversary of the debut of " friends " nears -- the pilot episode aired september 22 , 1994 -- longtime devotees may not be satisfied with one - half of the cast making an appearance			1
yet the actors themselves , from @entity9 and @entity58 to @entity23 , have warned fans to lower their expectations			0
in april , @entity10 told @entity61 that a full " friends " reunion was pretty unlikely , considering she could n't even get all of the stars in one place for dinner			2
" it 's not gon na happen , " @entity10 told the " @entity68 " host			0
" i 've been trying to put together a cast dinner for 10 years			0
i can get the girls to come , maybe @entity46			0
@entity44 canceled last time right at the last minute , ( @entity61 ) @entity72 lives here ( in @entity32 )			0
... so it 's not gon na happen			0
" in the meantime , at least there will be a @entity78 pop - up shop .			0
