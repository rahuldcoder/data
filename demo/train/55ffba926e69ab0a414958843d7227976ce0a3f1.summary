@entity0 -- a week before @entity3 became the first @entity5 president to mention gay rights in his inauguration speech , the @entity2 had already made history on that matter			1
believe it or not , on january 13 , there were half a million people on the streets of @entity14 , demonstrating against gay marriage			1
the @entity2 catholic church is supposed to be at its last gasp , but it seemed strong enough to mobilize parishes , religious school parents and the common conservative citizen against a project of " mariage pour tous " ( marriage for everybody ) , that had long been part of the new @entity30 president @entity29 's election platform			1
now that the law is being debated in parliament , it will likely pass within a month , but the ruckus will have stripped it of provisions deemed essential to the gay community : the equal rights , even if they are married , to start a family and raise their children			1
it may also trigger off a new culture war			0
the @entity44 would not have enjoyed that success alone , had it not found the most unexpected and efficient leader , in the person of @entity49 , alias " @entity47			0
" the nom - de - scÃ ¨ ne of this enterprising entertainer , known for her long - time connection to the @entity56 , the party of @entity52 , means " cookoo , " and was a rallying cry for silly demonstrations , in the 80s , against cold weather in @entity14 , before she met @entity62 in 2004 , and proclaimed herself " @entity64 's pr person			1
" i saw her recently on a @entity2 tv channel while , in her trademark miniskirt and fishnets , she was debating a lesbian activist named @entity72 , who asked @entity47 how she felt about " gathering hundred of thousand of people in a demonstration against the equal rights of another community			1
" she answered that she " loved gays , " reminding the audience she often " partied like crazy " at @entity80 , a well known hangout of the hip @entity14 @entity82 crowd			1
translation : gay was okay as long as it stayed in the " cage aux folles , " in drag , in an entertaining margin , but certainly not in the mundane realities of everyday life , where it is way more complicated			2
frigide , just like a majority of the @entity2 , supported the civil union enacted in 1999 , the so - called pacs , designed mainly for same sex couples			1
it gives some rights , but does n't legitimate partners as parents			2
and there is the rub : adoption , medically assisted procreation			0
" what about the bloodline ? what about mother nature , and the right of kids raised that way to know their true origin ? , shrieked @entity47 , oblivious to the fact that children adopted or medically procreated with donated eggs by straight parents have the same problem			0
it all boiled down , at the minute of truth , to that question : " what about their right to be raised normally ? she asked			0
by a mommy and a daddy ? " having witnessed the debate on same - sex marriage in the @entity5 , that episode confirms one more difference between our cultures			1
contrary to the @entity5 who , in spite of blunt evidence , still worship the act of marriage , with its fairy - tale rituals of proposing and funny kneeling , the @entity2 have a much more pessimistic , more realistic even , vision of the knot			1
but when it comes to families and raising kids , they seem to believe in the enchanted world of yore			0
in @entity5 , the same - sex unions were often seen as the sinful problem , as the @entity151 banners , " @entity153 , not @entity154 " proclaimed around the country			2
but children were nobody else 's business for those willing to adopt , or procreate with the methods available to anyone able to pay for donated eggs , sperm or a surrogate mother			0
in a country where unrealistic conditions slacken usual adoption , gay prospective parents have had to act as any straight single person would , ask for an adoption authorization , and , to improve the chances ... get the child in another country			0
the law debated these days may grant their partner equal parental rights for adoption			0
as for medically assisted procreation , it is another problem : as of today , it is simply forbidden unless the couple is heterosexual and married or able to prove they has lived together for at least two years			0
surrogate mothers are prohibited in @entity2 , plain and simple			2
@entity29 himself , though he promotes gay marriage as a progressive symbol , admitted he does n't personally favor allowing medically assisted reproduction to homosexuals , and with the assent of many socialist party officials , had these corresponding measures postponed -- for parliament to decide -- as another law to a future debate , in march , or never			1
one reason , besides the obvious fear of a culture war with the conservatives about sacred family values , maybe the fact that the government already pays four attempts of medically assisted procreation to heterosexual couples and does n't wish to have to extend this costly favor to gays , nor , more importantly , does it want to change at any price the national moral doctrine			0
assisted reproduction is considered in @entity2 only as a way to treat the medical condition of infertility			1
being gay is not an illness , neither is , for a woman , the fact that she has no man			0
as a consequence , @entity2 babies are born en masse from single and not - so - single mothers in nearby @entity221 or @entity222 , where specialized services are legally available for a price			2
" these children already exist in @entity2 , " concluded @entity72 on the show			2
" they were born from gay parents and they simply deserve to have it recognized			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 .			2

on january 13 , half a million demonstrated against gay marriage in @entity14
*protests* took place a week before @entity3 mentioned gay rights in inauguration speech
@entity2 have pessimistic vision of marriage compared to @entity5 , says @entity231
@entity2 only consider assisted reproduction for treating infertility , says @entity231
