during routine screening of arriving passengers , @entity0 and her companion were flagged by @entity34 's @entity51 at the airport and a decision was made to maintain surveillance on their movements			1

they lived in an apartment above an @entity122 restaurant for about five years , according to a neighbor who spoke on condition of anonymity			0
