he wrote more than 30 short stories and a handful of novellas , many published in @entity61 and collected in works such as " @entity63 " and " @entity64 : an introduction			1

@entity0 : author @entity43 dies at 91 @entity88 not all stimulus money goes to building bridges			1
the @entity90 is funding a lot of research , too			2

once the kids learn the games , @entity114 and his team will study their brains using magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity121 ) and high - density electroencephalography ( @entity123 )			1
@entity114 says that his research is driven by personal circumstances			2
he told the @entity128 for @entity130 web site , " i was always fascinated by order and regularity , " and as a child , he shared that fascination with his older brother , who has autism			2
" there was always a certain empathy between me and my brother , " @entity137 said			2

" @entity147 : award summary @entity151 the 57 - year - old @entity150 singer was once homeless , living on the streets of @entity153 , @entity154 , between 1993 and 1995			1

" @entity161 reports that @entity151 and his two brothers , @entity163 and @entity164 , had great success in the 1970s and 1980s as @entity166			0
but unable to cope with the financial side of the business , his life took a spiral downward			0
" i had no home , no money , " he says			0
" you could still hear my records on the radio			0
people gave me drugs because they thought i was still on top			0
nobody knew i was down and out			0
" @entity151 eventually got into rehab and married the director of the treatment program he was in			1
then , in 1996 , @entity183 asked him to be part of his recordings and his career -- this time in hip - hop -- blossomed again " my blessings are ahead of me , " @entity151 told @entity161			1
" i 've cleaned out the garbage can			0

@entity161 : @entity151 fills the gap in his life 's winding road @entity199 5 - year - old has cystic fibrosis , an inherited chronic disease that can lead to life - threatening lung infections			1
@entity204 reports that @entity199 's parents , @entity206 and @entity207 , were not able to keep up with the cost of the expensive prescription drugs needed to treat their son			0
so they turned to @entity211 for help , and people started making donations			0
the tv station reports that on wednesday -- @entity199 's birthday -- an anonymous donor met the family at a local @entity219 's and gave them $ 2,300 for his medications			1
according to the @entity222 , the disease affects some 30,000 children and adults in the @entity130			0
@entity204 : anonymous donor helps pay for child 's medication @entity222 : what you need to know what makes a person intriguing ? there are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new , important or different			1
others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect			0
and there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news			0
some of these people do what we expect of them : they run for office , pass legislation , start a business , get hired or fired , commit a crime , make an arrest , get in accidents , hit a home run , overthrow a government , fight wars , sue an opponent , put out fires , prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses			0
they do make news , but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story			0
but every day , there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character , how they reached their decision , how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in			0
we hear about them and want to know more			0
what they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country			0
at times , there is even a mystery about them			0
what they have done may be unique , heroic , cowardly or ghastly , but they capture our imaginations			0
we want to know what makes them tick , why they believe what they do , and why they did what they did			0
