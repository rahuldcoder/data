-- @entity1 and @entity2 have always taken things to the extreme			1
@entity2 , left , and @entity1 will be spending only 12 hours in each city before going to their next stop			1
so when @entity9 announced a monthlong all - you - can - jet pass for $ 599 , it was as if the airline had practically issued them a challenge			1
" we decided to come up with the most extreme length you could take it and have the most fun without being crazy , " @entity2 told @entity0			2
" we 've always pushed each other to be more outrageous , so this is just taking that to another level			0
" @entity1 and @entity2 , friends since their freshman year of college at @entity26 , will be crisscrossing the country , spending only 12 hours in each city before heading back to the airport and jetting to their next destination			1
the deal allows passengers unlimited travel to all cities @entity9 services from september 8 to october 8 for $ 599			1
@entity1 , who was recently saving up money to be a professional photographer , quit his job , and @entity2 decided to use all of his accumulated vacation time from his job to take the trip			1
they plan to make the most of the deal , hitting at least 29 cities in the 31 days by taking about 49 one - way flights			1
they 'll sleep during their flights , take showers in gyms , and have friends work as runners to swap out bags of clothes when they fly into @entity55 's @entity54 about every three days			2
they 've even worked with some companies to obtain sponsorships			0
they plan to interview fellow fliers to get the skinny on the best places to go in hopes of taking the " local 's tour " of a city as opposed to a generic tourist trip for their web site twelvehoursinacity.com			2
" what better way to get a snapshot of the @entity70 , " @entity1 said			2
" to really capture the unique culture of each city , to meet all of the different people			0
" and for them , the price is unbeatable			0
the way they see it , if each flight cost $ 200 , they 're taking a $ 10,000 trip for only $ 600			1
which is exactly why the promotion has received such a great deal of buzz , specifically among social networking platforms			0
@entity9 suspended the deal two days early , saying they were sold out , though the company declined to specify how many people bought them			1
@entity91 , who is taking time off from freelance work to take advantage , grabbed a pass right away			0
she decided that with the buzz on @entity96 , she could start organizing a group of fellow all - you - can - jet travelers , calling it the 599club			2
she created a site where people are sharing their itineraries in an attempt to either travel together , meet up with @entity96 followers in their cities or try to couch surf at other people 's homes			1
some may even meet in @entity110 to go skydiving together			0
@entity112 and @entity113 had been planning to move to @entity55 from @entity114 , @entity115 , when they heard about the deal			0
so they decided to pack up their home , bring in the movers and head off for vacation before their big move			0
given @entity9 's hub structure , many travelers found a slight hiccup : if they were in the @entity126 , they might have to travel all the way back to @entity55 to travel to the @entity128			1
the couple will be spending a large chunk of their trip in @entity133 and the @entity134 and will be doing video interviews with entrepreneurs around the world for @entity139 's web site , @entity140			0
for @entity142 , the pass is a chance to raise money for a charity close to his heart , Â­ an elementary school in @entity149 that his parents created for orphaned children in a small village two hours from a main road			0
@entity155 plans to go to 24 cities , using about 45 different flights , to have both an enjoyable vacation and hopefully meet people who will donate to the school			2
he also will be documenting his trip on his web site , 30daysonjetblue.com			0
though @entity1 and @entity2 may have the most exhausting schedule , they , like many others , think that if nothing else , the trip will be a true adventure			1
" no matter what happens , there will certainly be a story that comes out of this trip , " @entity1 said			2
" for us , the biggest concern will be finding a place to shower			0
we certainly do n't want to be the stinky guys on the plane , especially for that many flights			0
but either way , its going to be an adventure , a tiring but exciting adventure			1

deal allows passengers unlimited travel for a month on @entity9 for $ 599
@entity1 , @entity2 going to cities for 12 hours , then getting on next flight
some travelers taking around 40 one - way flights to make most of deal
@entity1 : " it 's going to be an adventure , a tiring but exciting adventure "
