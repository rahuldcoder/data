-- nine years ago he was an electrician			1
six months ago , he was worth some a $ 1.18 billion ( $ 1.22 billion ) @entity3 's mining boom having turned him into the country 's richest person under 40 years old			1
now , coal baron @entity6 , 36 , is facing a mountain of debt			1
his wealth has plummeted to a $ 400 million , thanks to slowing demand and falling coal prices , while his debts to a variety of creditors mount , reportedly hitting a $ 638 million			0
on tuesday , his personal holding company was liquidated			1
@entity6 has had the @entity17 on his way to the top of the rich list and -- until tuesday -- on the way down , too , staving off the liquidation of several of his companies			1
he now faces credit debt surrounding his horse racing empire , troubled sports franchises and repossession of his personal jet			1
while creditors have been circling for months , it was a tuesday decision of the @entity31 to wind up @entity6 's @entity32 over an unpaid a $ 28.4 million dollar debt that suggests the former electrician 's luck may have run dry			1
on wednesday , the @entity36 place his thoroughbred horse racing and breeding empire , @entity39 , into liquidation with a debt of a $ 2 million			1
@entity39 's cash flow problems were reported to be so severe , @entity6 was trying to stem the bleeding by downsizing operations in @entity45 and @entity3 and selling horses at bargain base prices to settle a state debt			1
he recently settled a a $ 16.6 million dispute with @entity50 over a failed land purchase in @entity52 and a a $ 2 million debt to the publicly listed contractor , @entity54 @entity6 's woes have impacted the @entity57 sporting world too			1
his @entity58 has reportedly fallen behind in meeting player salaries for his two prized clubs -- the a league @entity62 football team and the @entity64 league club			0
but @entity6 has come up with enough money to partially pay a significant , unpaid bill for the rent of stadiums used by the teams			2
and he has avoided the reported repossession of his personal jet worth a $ 40 million			2
@entity72 is said to have issued @entity6 an instruction to leave the @entity74 made @entity75 , replete with @entity77 leather seats , a conference room and bar , at a regional @entity52 airport			2
instead , he flew it to @entity82 where he and his family now live in two adjacent homes , reportedly with a @entity85 and @entity86 in the driveway			0
and in august with coal prices flailing , @entity6 abandoned plans for a a $ 5.3 billion take over @entity90 , one of @entity3 's largest coal producers with exploration assets in @entity94			1
@entity6 's @entity95 , however , remains the largest shareholder in @entity90 with a 19.4 % stake			1
navigating the downside of @entity3 's commodities boom is proving to be a wild ride for @entity6			1
as a result , the unlikely rich lister is in the business pages of @entity57 newspapers almost daily			2
and he does n't much like the attention			0
" there has definitely , absolutely , been a spirited media campaign to get me , " @entity6 told @entity52 's @entity106 earlier this month			1
seeking to sooth the doubters , he added , " i would say the noisy few have made a lot of people nervous and there is no need to be			0
" the order to liquidate his personal investment vehicle would indicate the nervousness is not a fiction of a media campaign			2
but @entity6 is accustomed to wild rides			2
the ride to the top for @entity3 's fastest self - made billionaire was not only wild			1
as a teenager , he headed for the rich coalfields of the @entity129 , north of @entity52 , according to a 2010 profile			0
there , he found work in the mines as an electrician , though a a $ 400 a week take home salary held little appeal			2
by 26 , he 'd formed his own mine machinery maintenance business , servicing coalmines , which were burgeoning and booming as @entity57 commodities fueled the expansion of @entity142 's infrastructure			2
then came his big break			0
in 2006 , he raised a a $ 1 million loan against his home and business for a deposit on a coal tenement in central @entity94			0
all he needed to do was raise another a $ 29 million to finance the deal			0
" i knocked on every door in @entity3 and many overseas to raise the funds			0
finally i succeeded after wearing out a lot of shoe leather , " he told @entity153 in 2010			0
investors came on board when exploratory drilling turned in heaven sent results - high grade coal samples			0
sitting on a promising asset , @entity6 sold it not once but twice -- first to @entity164 for a $ 275 million plus a 10 % stake in the company and a year later , in 2008 , with world coal prices soaring , he sold his stake in @entity164 to global steel giant @entity169			1
his a $ 1 million gamble turned into a multimillion dollar pile of cash with which he went on a buying spree -- football and rugby league clubs , horse studs , as well as property			0
he also formed @entity95 , a mining development vehicle , floated in 2010			0
the @entity95 merger with @entity90 was his great hope and even diminished by weak coal prices , it remains his main asset			0
if the former electrician ca n't pull another rabbit out of his hat , faith in the @entity17 may be all that remains to stave off bankruptcy .			0
