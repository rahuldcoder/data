off @entity0 , @entity1 -- against a bright blue sky , seagulls noisily squabbled above us as we set off aboard a crew boat , feeling rather small as we gently weaved our way past the gigantic vessels docked in @entity0 harbor			1
the calm conditions that had allowed us to easily film inside the port quickly changed once we left the harbor , as we came up against 25 - knot winds , rolling waves and spray soaking us from all sides			0
having grown up on the northeast coast of @entity18 , this was the @entity19 that i know and love			1
as we happily bounced around , we joked with the crew from @entity24 ' marine contracting business unit , @entity25 , that we were -- despite having three cameras , a tripod , and two backpacks -- actually traveling light			2
about 2 miles ( 3 kilometers ) out to sea , between the waves , we got fleeting glimpses of the @entity33 , the support vessel for remotely operated underwater vehicles			1
we could tell it was large , but as we drew closer to the 315 - foot ( 96 - meter ) vessel it became clear it was not only large , but a serious piece of maritime engineering			2
above its bow was a large helipad , and from the main deck a huge crane extended , with 9,800 feet ( 3,000 meters ) of cable			2
as we approached the @entity33 , conditions were too dangerous for us to board and we had to wait for the massive vessel to turn to give us a bit of shelter			2
while waiting we filmed our first key sequence : the @entity52 being lowered into the water			1
sequence recorded , next came the challenge of boarding			0
the tools used in the search sheltered from the worst of the weather we were still rising and falling in the water by as much as 10 feet -- which , in @entity62 's words , was making things a little " lively			0
" to board , we had to wait for the bow of our boat to rise up and then throw ourselves at a small wood and rope ladder and hanging grab rope and pull ourselves aboard			1
only sitting at the airport at the end of the day did we admit to each other that we could replace the word " lively " with " terrifying			0
" safely aboard , we were welcomed by capt. @entity75 on the bridge			0
after our safety briefing we did some more filming , followed by a tour of the @entity33			0
conditions on board the @entity83 - registered vessel were a credit to the crew			1
everything was immaculate and beautifully organized			0
you can see why that matters when at any one time , there can be 100 people on board , working around the clock for up to four months at a time			0
our filming schedule was pretty similar to our other @entity2 shoots : interviews , key sequences and unique shots that would allow us to paint the story with rich visuals			1
but filming on board a ship did present a few additional challenges			0
as the ship rolled in the waves the light kept changing			0
this meant photojournalist @entity62 adopted an @entity108 - style pose , waving a light in one hand while operating the camera with the other to counteract the changing light			2
there were also the stairs to contend with -- five decks of steep stairs			0
when you 're hauling full broadcast equipment , it certainly adds up to a workout			0
only moments after joking with one of the @entity52 engineers that you learn quickly not to forget things , i realized i 'd left the spare batteries for the microphone on the bridge five decks up			1
@entity134 : a mission of hope and uncertainty broadcast equipment and water do n't usually go well together , and there was a danger that filming our underwater sequence would go wrong			2
using the ingenuity of the @entity52 crew we securely attached our underwater camera to the arms of the @entity52			1
but when the @entity52 and camera descended into the depths and as i watched the live feed turn from brilliantly clear shots to a murky green and eventually to black , i could n't help but worry that this was the last time we would see this camera			1
twenty - seven agonizing minutes later , the camera was back on deck and perfectly dry inside its case			2
as we reviewed the footage through a small monitor , our grainy images gave us an impression of just how incredible the @entity52 was			1
its complexity , dexterity and adaptability not only made for great visuals for our viewers , but also began to give us an idea of how it could be used to help with retrieving items from the ocean floor			2
after filming some beautiful detail shots from around the ship -- sonar monitors , controls , compasses , barometers -- we concluded the shoot from the bridge , now drenched in the early evening sun. looking back to shore we could see in the distance our crew boat crashing through the waves toward us , bringing an end to our time on this incredible vessel with its incredible crew			1
this also meant we had to face the rope ladder again			1
as we were now self - proclaimed experts at disembarking , with life jacket tightly fastened i went first			0
to ensure that we had something to show for our shoot , @entity62 kept hold of the camera cards in case i decided to copy the @entity52 and take a dip in the water			1
we only spent a short amount of time with the talented crew of the @entity33 , but we did get a sense of how good they are at what they do , and how incredibly difficult their work is			0
6 missteps in the investigation			0

@entity2 crew boarded a support vessel in the @entity19 for demo of remotely operated vehicles
their camera went deep underwater on an @entity52 and returned with great video
@entity222 describes *thrills* of dragging heavy gear around huge vessel in heavy seas
getting on and off the vessel involved leaps between crew boat and a small rope ladder
