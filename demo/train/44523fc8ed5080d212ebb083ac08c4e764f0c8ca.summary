@entity1 , @entity0 -- five people got the lavish ride of a lifetime as the only passengers on a transatlantic flight , causing environmental groups to criticize the major carrier for leaving a wasteful carbon footprint			1
@entity11 has faced criticism for a transatlantic flight carrying only five passengers			1
using about 68,000 liters ( 15,000 imperial gallons ) -- or 13,000 liters per passenger -- of jet fuel for the nine - hour trip from @entity19 to @entity1 , @entity11 is being accused of unnecessary waste			1
each passenger left a footprint of 35.77 tons of carbon dioxide , enough to drive an average car 160,000 kilometers ( 100,000 miles )			0
" flying virtually empty planes is an obscene waste of fuel			0
through no fault of their own , each passenger 's carbon footprint for this flight is about 45 times what it would have been if the plane had been full , " @entity29 's transport campaigner @entity28 said			0
because of a mechanical malfunction , @entity11 flight 90 was 14 hours late leaving @entity19 's @entity39 on february 8			1
though most passengers made other arrangements to @entity1 , five lucky passengers unable to be rebooked made the 6,400 kilometer ( 4,000 mile ) flight in business class , with two crew members per passenger			1
@entity11 said it chose to continue with the flight because of the full load of passengers waiting at @entity1 's @entity51 airport to return to the @entity52			1
" with such a small passenger load we did consider whether we could cancel the flight and re-accommodate the five remaining passengers on other flights , " says @entity11 ' @entity54 spokesperson @entity53			1
" however , this would have left a plane load of west - bound passengers stranded in @entity51 who were due to fly to the @entity52 on the same aircraft			1
" @entity64 was quick to point out that despite the staggeringly low passenger count , the flight did carry a full cargo load			1
" we sought alternative flights for the west - bound passengers but heavy loads out of @entity1 meant that this was not possible			2
the only option was to operate the flight , " @entity64 said			0
" this put the aircraft in @entity51 for the following day , enabling us to operate a full schedule and avoid further inconvenience to our passengers and cargo customers			2
" environmental groups such as @entity29 say that international governments should hold the aviation industry accountable for the amount of @entity84 they produce each year , and point to instances like this to show that airlines should pay a fuel tax to rein them in			2
" governments must stop granting the aviation industry the unfair privileges that allow this to happen by taxing aviation fuel and including emissions from aviation in international agreements to tackle climate change , " @entity28 said			0
but despite these accusations , @entity98 , air transport intelligence editor for @entity99 , said the amount passengers carried was irrelevant			0
" airlines are still a business			0
the cargo had to be flown and perhaps some of it was time - sensitive , " @entity98 said			0
" it 's just not practical for an airline to tell its customers that it wo n't fly until it has a full passenger load			2
customers wo n't be happy and the airline will quickly be out of business			0
