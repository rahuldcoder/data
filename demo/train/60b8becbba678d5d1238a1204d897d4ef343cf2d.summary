@entity0 -- watch out , @entity2			2
@entity3 is steadily catching up in space			2
between june and august this year , @entity3 plans to launch its manned @entity6 spacecraft and then rendezvous and dock with a space lab which has been orbiting the earth since september			1
three astronauts will undertake the voyage , but one of them will not board the space lab. he will remain inside the spacecraft as a precautionary measure in case of emergency			0
it will be @entity3 's first crew expedition involving manual docking			1
if all goes as planned , @entity3 will become only the third nation , next to the @entity2 and @entity20 , to dock capsules in space			1
" it demonstrates @entity3 's continued commitment to becoming a first - class space power with an independent space capability , " says @entity23 , associate professor at @entity24 ( @entity24 )			1
" this is very exclusive club			0
" @entity3 's space program goes farther			1
" the @entity3 manned space program has announced its plan on 20 future space voyages , " wrote @entity31 of the official @entity32			1
" @entity3 also plans to establish its own space lab around 2016 and assemble a 60 - ton manned space station around 2020 , when the current @entity38 is estimated to likely retire			1
" @entity3 has also begun efforts to explore the moon using space robotics			2
the country 's eventual goal is a manned lunar landing			1
the @entity3 exploration plans , announced in december , come as the @entity2 has been scaling back its plans and funding for space exploration			1
@entity3 's space program has become a campaign issue in the @entity2			1
in recent debates among presidential aspirants in the @entity53 , candidates criticized @entity2 's flagging space program			1
@entity55 called for a partnership among " corporate @entity2 as well as the defense network and others " to " create a plan that will keep our space program thriving and growing			2
" @entity62 cited @entity3 's soaring ambitions			1
" every serious analyst understands that the @entity3 are going all out to dominate space , " @entity64 said			2
" i would like to have an @entity2 on the moon before the @entity3 get there			2
" to be sure , @entity3 is still decades away from a moon - landing			2
@entity3 officials speak of a three - step manned space flight plan : send man into orbit , dock spacecraft together to form a small space lab , and ultimately build a large space station			1
" they are currently in step two , " says @entity76 of the @entity2 @entity77			0
" for comparative purposes , it 's about where the @entity2 was during the @entity82			2
" @entity3 has been striving to put man into orbit since 1992			0
@entity3 has developed its own spaceship , the @entity86 , or @entity87 , which observers say resembles @entity20 's @entity90 space capsule			1
over the years , it has upgraded its launch vehicles , built new spaceflight facilities and trained a stable of astronauts			0
still , @entity3 did not put a man in space until 2003 , 41 years after @entity97 became the first @entity2 to orbit earth			1
that year , colonel @entity99 orbited the @entity100 14 times aboard the @entity103 space capsule			0
@entity99 became an instant celebrity , paraded around the country and overseas			0
several months later , he was promoted to general			0
@entity99 's voyage has enhanced @entity3 's image overseas and boosted national pride at home			1
only @entity20 , the @entity2 and @entity3 have sent men into space			1
before that , @entity3 's space program was largely seen as capable but lacking in sophistication			1
i saw that myself up close			0
in august 1997 , i had the rare chance of visiting the @entity118 in rural @entity120 province to observe the launch of @entity122 , the first @entity124 communications satellite			0
inside a windowless building , we watched @entity3 staff work frenetically behind rows of computers and panels			0
they struck me as quite unassuming in their white wrinkled robes that made them look more like doctors in a hospital ward than aerospace experts			0
there was palpable anxiety before the launch			0
two years earlier , a rocket exploded in this launch site after liftoff and killed several people on the ground			0
this time , when the @entity3 - made rocket rumbled skyward , the crowd in the hall cheered			0
the glitch-less launch restored @entity3 's reputation and self - confidence			1
over the years , @entity3 has been vying for a bigger slice of the lucrative satellite - launch market			2
@entity3 also looks to harness aerospace technology for trickle - down spinoffs in telecommunications , weather forecasting , agriculture , medicine and navigation			0
experts say the upcoming launch will place @entity3 close to putting a space station in orbit			1
such a station , a la @entity38 , will enable @entity3 to conduct scientific and military research			0
experts say the @entity3 could use the station to conduct biological , genetic and energy research			2
at the same time , they could also use it as a platform to spy on potential adversaries or to develop lasers capable of blinding or disabling other satellites			0
the @entity3 space program is largely run by government - owned enterprises or military - affiliated groups			0
many of the pilots , scientists and engineers are active or demobilized army officers			0
@entity3 promises to never use space research for military purposes			0
" a rapidly developing space industry does not mean @entity3 has renounced its commitment to peace , " says @entity183 , the chief designer of the @entity86 spaceship series			0
" all @entity3 is doing is to pursue a peaceful development of the space industry as planned			0
" still , experts say , the @entity2 remains concerned about @entity3 space activities			1
" over 95 % of space technology is dual use , meaning of value to both civil and military communities , " says @entity76 of the @entity2 @entity77			0
" while the @entity2 is still far ahead of @entity3 technically , @entity3 has something critical that the @entity2 does notâ € ” the political will to push forward			2
" if the trajectory remains unchanged , experts say , @entity3 's space activities may well surpass those of @entity20 and the @entity201 within a decade or so			1
that will position @entity3 just next to the @entity2 as a dominant space power .			1

@entity3 plans to launch its first manned flight to dock at space lab in 2012
country plans to build a space station , working towards a manned lunar landing
@entity3 's space ambitions are a campaign issue in the upcoming @entity2 *election*
@entity3 's may overtake @entity20 and @entity218 's space activities in a decade , experts says
