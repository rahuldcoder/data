-- when @entity4 first moved to @entity5 , the rights of the city 's labor population was the furthest thing from her mind			1
that changed soon after her arrival , when she spotted one of the @entity12 's five million migrant workers in line at the local grocery store			1
" i had my chubby baby in my arms , and this guy in front was trying to pay for a tiny bread roll and a small bottle of yoghurt			0
he did n't have enough coins to pay for it			0
i was looking at him , and looking at my groceries and feeling bad about it , and i thought , ' how can i make this better ? ' " says @entity24 , a @entity25 citizen with @entity27 and @entity28 roots			0
" it 's my son 's birthday today , and to celebrate , i was wondering if you 'd do the honor of letting us treat you ? " she asked him in @entity33 , instructing him to choose anything he wanted from the store			2
he left the line and came back with a diminutive bottle of strawberry milk			0
" he did n't try to take advantage			0
he was so humble and sweet , " she recalls			0
nine years later , and @entity24 heads up @entity46 , a charity she started that offers up support services to a handful of the country 's laborers			1
at any given time , she helps a roster of 53,000 men spread across 52 camps throughout the @entity12			1
" i have four kids and 53,000 adopted kids			2
it 's not easy , " she says			2
spreading the knowledge bug for the most part , @entity46 is a one - woman show ( aside from an assistant and a @entity65 army of volunteers , @entity24 runs the charity primarily on her own )			1
an impressive feat , given the range of services she offers			2
she gives the men counseling , organizes events to get them out of the camps , distributes care packages , and on occasion pays for the men 's medical fees and school fees for their children back home			1
" every camp we adopt we make bed bug - free , cockroach - free and lice - free			1
we physically shampoo the men 's hair ourselves , " she says			2
she also gives them hygiene workshops with the understanding that they pass on what they learn to their families and communities back home			0
" a lot of these men come from villages where they are n't taught the concept of germs -- these microscopic organisms that exist and can make you sick			0
we 've had great feedback from the men that have returned home ; in their villages , dysentery levels are down and deaths in childbirth are down			0
" knowledge 's infectious potential is a major tenet of the charity			1
@entity24 has also arranged @entity119 lessons for some of the men though @entity122 in @entity5 with the similar understanding that they 'll spread their learning			1
workers ' rights @entity46 has a couple of unexpected sponsors , in the form of the @entity130 and the @entity131			2
@entity24 works with the latter to help ensure the country 's laborers are made aware of their rights when they need to impose them -- particularly in the event that their employers stop signing their checks			1
" it was a common problem during the recession , but it still happens now and again			0
we 'd hear from the men that they had n't been paid for months , or even a year , and that their families were starving and they were starving			0
we worked with the @entity131 to help them get home , or find a better job , " she says			0
@entity24 , who is careful to lay the blame on unscrupulous employers and not the government , notes that there are labor laws in the @entity12 designed to protect migrant workers from such an eventuality			1
" the law is that if a man is not paid , even for one month , he is entitled to receive his salary , a plane ticket home , and any extraneous costs incurred , " she says			0
while @entity162 , a researcher for @entity163 , concedes that conditions have improved for workers in the @entity12 over the last few years ( mainly in the form of better housing ) , he also notes that the laws designed to protect laborers are n't always enforced			1
" theoretically , workers can take complaints to the labor courts			2
theoretically , they should be able to get their salaries back , but justice is dispensed in a very ad hoc manner , if it is dispensed at all " he says , " he says			0
" the issue is : what happens to the employer after they 're found guilty ? are they prosecuted ? it seems the worse that happens to them is the government forces them to pay workers their salaries			2
but if employers are not prosecuted , what message does that send ? " further complicating the issue , suggests @entity162 , is the lack of separation between the government and the construction companies			0
" the line between public and private in the @entity12 is so fine as to be almost non-existent			1
the people that own and run some of the biggest construction firms are people in government , " he says			0
the issue is not unique to the @entity12			1
other @entity204 , including @entity205 and @entity206 , have also been criticized for their treatment of guest workers			0
@entity162 ( who is currently blacklisted from the @entity12 ) says that better transparency in the region would be a step in the right direction			1
" it 's obviously admirable that there are people on the ground to assist workers , but it 's also important that @entity219 are allowed to criticize the government for their actions when necessary			1
she 's carrying one part of the equation , and that 's important , but we need the other side as well			0
" @entity0 contacted the @entity12 's @entity131 for comment but did not receive a reply .			1
