when the latest @entity2 newsletter hit my inbox , bearing news that @entity5 is separating from her husband @entity6 , i had a lot of questions			1
and one of the very first ones to come out of my mouth was " what 's ' @entity15 ' ? " referring to the title of @entity5 's announcement			1
i assumed it was just a cute little header she made up to soften the blow — something to fit within her fancy lifestyle brand 's aesthetic , sort of like the way that she calls her " best of " lists the " @entity24			1
" @entity26 : see @entity5 's @entity27 but as i scrolled down , i quickly realized that " conscious uncoupling " is not just a @entity5 - ism or a @entity2 - ism			1
conscious @entity15 is very much a thing , one that 's been around for years , though under the radar — well , until now			1
leave it to @entity24 to always be the first to introduce any and every new - age lifestyle tip and trick we never knew we needed , even during what must be a painful and tragic time ( see : oil pulling , macriobiotic diets , countless juice cleanses , the @entity41 method , agave , and soaked almonds )			2
@entity26 : @entity44 and we need them now below her announcement , @entity5 had doctors dr. @entity48 ( whom she 's tapped for numerous @entity2 newsletters ) and his wife , dr. @entity50 , explain the @entity52 concept at length			1
at a lot of length			0
a " conscious uncoupling is the ability to understand that every irritation and argument [ within a marriage ] was a signal to look inside ourselves and identify a negative internal object that needed healing , " they write			1
" from this perspective , there are no bad guys , just two people , " they say , expanding on the blame - free , " it 's about people as individuals , not just the relationship " theory			1
@entity26 : in defense of @entity5 and her very public statements that makes sense to me , the mutual responsibility , no - pointing - fingers aspect — though not all of the super-lengthy explanation does			1
err , far from it			0
i 've read the thing over half a dozen times , and yet i still ca n't seem to process these parts : " life is a spiritual exercise in evolving from an exoskeleton for support and survival to an endoskeleton			0
i do n't get it			0
" there 's a scientific theory by @entity99 esotericist , @entity98 , that the creation of insects was a failed attempt by nature to evolve a higher form of consciousness			1
" i think we 're getting off topic ? @entity26 : the truth about @entity5 's @entity109 " conscious uncoupling brings wholeness to the spirits of both people who choose to recognize each other as their teacher ... if we can allow ourselves this gift , our exoskeleton of protection and imprisonment will fall away and offer us the opportunity to begin constructing an endoskeleton , an internal cathedral , with spiritual trace minerals like self - love , self - acceptance , and self - forgiveness			1
" huh ? " the misunderstandings involved in divorce also have much to do with the lack of intercourse between our own internal masculine and feminine energies			0
" but what about the lack of just ... intercourse ? @entity26 : " @entity135 " so i called up @entity137 , a coach in the @entity52 method , for a little more clarification			0
apparently the method can be traced back to one woman , @entity141 , who developed it in 2010			0
( she 's currently writing a book about it , which is certainly good timing for her			2
) conscious @entity15 , @entity137 tells me , is a five - week course , though it takes some couples and individuals longer to complete it , naturally			2
( " some couples get stuck on week one for three weeks , " she says , like she 's all too familiar			2
) the method upholds that there are three " power bases , " which are your relationship with yourself , with others , and with life , and that you need to understand all of them to get to the " deeper truth			0
" the relationship with yourself is often trickiest for people to pin down , but it 's central to how conscious @entity15 relates to divorces and separations			1
" it 's not the fault of one person , " says @entity137 , or even as simple as any overt betrayals and injuries from one person to another			2
@entity26 : why women still fake it instead , in a relationship , " each party has brought to the dynamic a set of patterns that they 've been living inside of for years , " she says , and those things contribute to the downfall whether they realize it at first or not			0
the @entity52 method , then , involves addressing those things and their impact on a relationship			0
" like , say , someone had been cheated on			0
it 's not as simple as black and white			2
the other party would want to address if they had done anything to contribute to that			0
if they had been withdrawing , " @entity137 offers			0
that 's how conscious @entity194 approaches everything , with a " we both did this , we 're both responsible " outlook , which should , in theory , keep things amicable between two parties in a divorce or separation , since they both feel guilty			1
and how does that relate to @entity5 ? why might she have chosen the method for her own separation ? " well , children really get the benefit from a @entity15 , " @entity137 ventures , vaguely referencing @entity209 and @entity210 , @entity5 's two children with @entity6 , and " @entity15 is really growing amongst parents , " she says			1
" @entity215 , it 's so exciting how quickly it 's growing everywhere , " she adds			2
and surely , after all this exposure , this is just the beginning .			0
