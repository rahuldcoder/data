-- @entity2 's financial state was thrown into stark relief on thursday after the @entity7 club 's @entity5 owners revealed a record loss of $ 137 million despite making an unprecedented operating profit of $ 160 million			1
the disparity of figures is largely caused by interest payments of $ 67 million and a one - off cost of $ 107 million relating to the @entity16 outfit 's bond scheme , launched in january to help restructure the debts accrued by the @entity19 family in purchasing the 18 - time @entity7 champions in 2005			1
the club produced a record turnover of $ 455 million for the year ended june 2010 , more than double that of local rivals @entity24 , but suffered a big swing from last year 's profit of $ 77 million -- which was largely due to the world - record $ 130 million sale of @entity29 to @entity30			1
however , @entity2 chief executive @entity31 insisted that the @entity19 were not in the same position as fellow @entity5 @entity33 and @entity34 , who have been forced to sell @entity35 due to debts incurred in buying the now ailing five - time @entity38 champions			1
" we are not a club that needs to sell			2
we have money in the bank so there is zero pressure on that , no pressure at all to sell any star player whether it is @entity46 or @entity47 , @entity48 or @entity49 i can categorically say that , " @entity50 told the @entity52 @entity51			0
" there was no desire at all from anyone at the club to sell @entity29 -- he wanted to go , and as a result we managed to extract a world - record fee			2
the philosophy is to retain and attract the best players			0
we have £ 165 million ( £ 260 million ) in the bank , but in some ways we would prefer to have £ 80 million in the bank and @entity29 on the pitch			0
" @entity65 targets third @entity38 crown @entity50 was heartened by figures such as those showing that the club has the lowest wages - turnover ratio in the @entity16 of 46 % , despite player salaries rising from $ 195 million to $ 210 million			1
by comparison , @entity16 champions @entity73 's wage bill was last reported at $ 226 million , @entity24 's is $ 212 million and @entity75 's $ 175 million			1
" there are very good results for the club with records here , there and everywhere but they are complicated with non-cash items and exceptional one - off hits , " @entity50 said			2
" the @entity2 fans should not be concerned			2
we have a long - term financing structure in place , excellent revenues that are growing , we are controlling our costs and we can afford the interest on our long - term finance			0
" in our opinion , if something changed in the ownership , this club will survive and continue -- it is covering the financing cost more than adequately			0
we still have cash to invest in players and to give good contracts to players , and we are comfortable with the business model			0
" while @entity2 's overall debt has risen to $ 830 million , the accounts revealed that the @entity19 did not take out any money from the club to service their high - interest payment - in - kind loans of $ 318 million			1
@entity2 's media revenues rose to $ 167 million but match - day income fell to $ 160 million , reflecting moves by supporters ' clubs to undermine the @entity19 by boycotting games			1
the @entity16 on friday confirmed that @entity35 's prospective new owners , @entity113 , have passed the ruling body 's criteria			1
however , @entity113 -- who own the @entity118 baseball team -- face a court battle with @entity33 and @entity34 , who are trying to block the sale agreed by @entity35 's board this week			0
meanwhile , veteran @entity2 goalkeeper @entity122 has denied reports claiming that he has decided to retire at the end of this season			2
" that 's complete nonsense			0
i do n't yet know whether i will stop or continue after this season			0
only in the course of this season will i think about it			0
then i will decide and not before			0
for now i keep my focus on @entity2 , " the 39 - year - old @entity134 told website www.sport-promotion.nl .			1

@entity2 's owners make record loss of $ 137 million despite operating profit of $ 160 million
@entity19 family 's debts incurred in buying @entity7 club in 2005 largely to blame
the 18 - time @entity7 champions ' turnover for year ended june 2010 was $ 455 million
@entity2 's wage bill is only 46 *percent* of turnover , the lowest ratio in @entity16
