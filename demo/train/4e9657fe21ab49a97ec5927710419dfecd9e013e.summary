-- the argument between government leaders over how to handle and where to house the influx of migrant children from @entity6 is playing out across a couple of blocks in downtown @entity9			1
at the gold - domed state capitol , gov. @entity10 is complaining that the @entity13 administration did n't tell officials it was sending more than 1,000 children to @entity16			1
at @entity18 , mayor @entity17 says his city would provide a " safe haven " for the children			1
more than 50,000 unaccompanied children have been detained so far this year as they 've tried to cross the @entity24 southern border			1
federal authorities say the rate of apprehension has slowed in recent weeks			0
the @entity28 is charged with finding suitable facilities to house the children while they wait for an immigration hearing or to be reunited with family			2
some state and local governments , community organizations and churches across the country have taken children in but some governments are asking not to be considered as a landing place for the kids			1
or in @entity10 's case , complaining about not being told about it			0
@entity44 wrote to president @entity13 last week asking for the federal government to stem the flow of the children to the state saying it was " unconscionable that your administration " failed to inform state officials that 1,154 of the kids had been sent there			1
" your administration continues to send refugees to @entity16 , while at the same time many mayors and legislators from across the political spectrum have expressed their ( and my ) desire to reign in the influx of refugees to the @entity16			1
it is my hope that you and your administration will respect this request , " @entity10 said in his letter			0
@entity17 's position was the opposite , saying tuesday the minors would be welcomed in his city			1
" i 'm going to send a message in no uncertain terms to the extent that these children need a safe place , and a safe haven , ( and ) the city of @entity9 is going to be that , " the mayor told reporters , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity79			1
@entity10 softened his tone on wednesday after meeting with a group of local @entity83 leaders			0
he said in a statement that he asked them for guidance and advice about how the state should respond and added the activists told him they thought most of the children in @entity16 were placed with relatives			1
" for the state to safeguard these children who are here now , we still need more information about their federal status and where they 're staying			2
it goes without saying , these situations involve our public education , public health and public safety resources , and i 'm concerned about additional burdens being placed on local taxpayers in @entity16 , " @entity10 said			2
" but i made this pledge to the group : as a state we will let the federal process work			2
and during the time it takes to accomplish that , i 'm sure @entity113 will show their compassion toward these children who have undergone harrowing circumstances			0
" deal 's complaint was similar to one by @entity120 gov. @entity119 , who said his state discovered the presence of migrant minors there through an online posting by @entity28			2
@entity128 mayor @entity127 's administration said over the weekend it 's willing to house up to 1,000 children in city facilities			1
" the influx of unaccompanied child migrants is a growing humanitarian crisis that we can no longer ignore , " @entity127 said sunday in a statement			1
" while we have our own challenges at home , we can not turn our backs on children that are fleeing dangerous conditions			0
we will do our part to ensure that these children are given access to services and treated fairly and humanely			0
" rep. @entity147 , @entity148 , a major proponent of immigration reform and someone who has strongly opposed calls for deporting the children after they are arrested , said he is proud to see @entity128 " lead by example " in trying to find housing for some of the minors			1
" sometimes the greatness of our nation and our city are tested and how we treat children in danger is one of those tests , " @entity147 said in a statement			2
earlier this month @entity167 gov. @entity166 , another major @entity168 supporter of the president , proposed two locations in the @entity167 to temporarily house undocumented immigrant children , including a federal base on @entity173 that proposal has generated a controversy among some @entity167 residents			0
these offers follow a dust - up between another @entity168 ally , @entity181 gov. @entity180 , and the @entity182 over the issue			0
@entity180 , who had criticized plans to deport many of the undocumented children , clashed with a senior @entity182 official in a phone call after he asked some of the kids not be sent to a site in his state			2
" what i said was that would not be the most inviting site in @entity181 , " @entity180 told @entity0 senior white house correspondent @entity193			0
" there are already hundreds of kids already located throughout @entity181			0
" @entity180 was referring to his phone conversation with @entity182 domestic policy director @entity200			0
@entity180 also told @entity0 he was open to housing them in other sites in the state			0
@entity182 mulls steps on immigration it can take on its own @entity6 leaders to @entity13 : we 're working on it @entity0 's @entity210 contributed to this story .			0
