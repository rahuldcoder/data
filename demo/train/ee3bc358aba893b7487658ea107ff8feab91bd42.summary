@entity0 -- the serendipitous occurrence of this year 's @entity5 holiday on the same evening as the @entity2 is a festive occasion to reflect on the place of @entity8 in @entity10 collective consciousness and on @entity11 as @entity10			1
on the same evening that millions of @entity10 gather around their @entity5 dinner to celebrate this most @entity10 of holidays , even more millions of @entity11 around the globe , including the growing number of @entity14 , will do the same -- celebrating as well one of the most definitive moments of their faith -- prophet @entity21 's willingness to sacrifice his son for his @entity23			1
this holiday celebration comes soon after the tragic incident at @entity26 , when the atrocious act of a mass murderer put @entity8 and @entity11 under some pressure to either denounce or defend their faith			2
the psychotic act of maj. @entity32 , @entity33 , a @entity14 military psychiatrist at @entity26 who went on a rampage killing 13 @entity10 soldiers and wounding 30 others , has prompted two diametrically opposed reactions			2
on one side are people who say that @entity8 -- and @entity8 alone -- is inherently violent and by extension @entity11 are constitutionally driven to murder , while on the other are apologetic @entity11 who argue their faith is peaceful and benevolent -- unrelated to criminal acts such as @entity32 's			0
the fact is that @entity45 and @entity46 have as much claim on @entity8 as do @entity48 , @entity49 and the @entity51 poet @entity50 , who is the best - selling poet in @entity10			0
@entity8 is an abstraction and any @entity11 , saintly or satanic , detested or beloved , can and does have a claim on it -- and @entity8 is not the only world religion with this proclivity for good and evil			0
the distinguished @entity59 columnist @entity58 , one of the most consistently militant warriors in his take on @entity10 involvements in @entity63 and @entity64 , takes @entity8 -- and @entity8 alone -- to task for having a diabolic roughness on its fringes			0
but even if so , @entity8 is not alone in this failure to curtail murderous instincts			0
the same @entity70 that produced @entity71 and his non-violent theory of civil disobedience has also produced @entity70 fundamentalists who sliced and skewered pregnant @entity11 women alive in @entity76			0
the same @entity77 that produced @entity78 and @entity79 also produced children 's crusades and @entity83 conquistadors who burned native americans alive 13 at a time ( according to the 16th - century @entity83 @entity88 priest , @entity87 ) in honor of the @entity90 and @entity91			0
it also produced @entity10 @entity92 who killed 32 students and himself at @entity94 and @entity10 @entity95 , who raped and murdered 33 young men and boys in @entity99 , @entity100 , in the 1970s			0
the same @entity101 that produced @entity102 , @entity103 , or @entity104 also produced the @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			0
but the knee jerk reaction of blaming @entity8 and @entity11 , in general , or looking for delusional links to " @entity110 , " for the horrific murders at @entity26 points to something far more fundamental , overdue , and urgent -- namely something of a psychological barrier for @entity10 to accept the @entity8 component of their own society , culture , and history			1
to avoid singling out @entity8 as diabolical , it is imperative for @entity10 to come to terms with the collectively repressed fact that by far the most important social uprising of their 20th century -- namely the civil rights movement of the 1960s -- is not as exclusively a @entity126 phenomenon as it is made out to be : the towering figure of a @entity11 revolutionary named @entity129 is of great importance in the history of that movement			1
it took a whole generation of @entity10 to accept the fact that @entity136 civil rights activists were instrumental in many measures of the success that was achieved in the 1960s			1
it is long overdue for @entity10 also to recognize that @entity129 was equally , if not more , important to the civil rights movement			1
the way the history of the civil rights movement is mostly remembered now , an overwhelming role is assigned to the @entity146 genealogy of @entity147 @entity129 is delegated to a radical fringe -- portrayed as more of a menace and a hindrance than a positive force in the civil rights movement			1
but without the simultaneous presence of @entity129 as a @entity11 revolutionary , the @entity146 pacifism of @entity147 would not have been as formidable a force			2
@entity129 and @entity147 were the yin and yang of the civil rights movement -- ennobling anger and vision coming together in hopes of realizing the dream of equality			1
for more than three decades now , i have taught generations of @entity10 students who come to college having scarce read a word about @entity129 , and yet everything about @entity147 until @entity10 come to terms with the fact that they are deeply indebted to a @entity11 revolutionary for the fruits of the civil rights movement they enjoy today , @entity8 and @entity11 will continue to be seen as archetypically alien and an everlasting danger to @entity10 lives and liberties			1
@entity10 are @entity126 , jews , @entity179 , agnostics , atheists , and anything else in between -- but @entity10 are also @entity11 , millions of them , and @entity8 has now become integral to what the distinguished @entity10 sociologist @entity183 termed our " civil religion			2
" it is only apt that this particular @entity5 , @entity10 think about @entity2 , as precious to @entity11 - @entity10 as the occasion that has gathered us all " at the table			1
" let 's make room for @entity11 " at the table " because -- to quote @entity192 -- they " too , sing @entity10			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			0

@entity10 @entity11 celebrate @entity5 and an important religious occasion on same day
@entity196 says @entity26 shootings were an atrocity
@entity203 : @entity129 , a *muslim* , played key role in civil rights movement
