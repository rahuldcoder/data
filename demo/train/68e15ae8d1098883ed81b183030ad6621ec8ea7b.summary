@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity6 soldier accused of killing 16 civilians during a weekend rampage has been transferred out of @entity1 while awaiting charges , the @entity4 command said late wednesday			1
the still - unidentified @entity11 staff sergeant was transferred on the recommendation of advisers to gen. @entity14 , the commander of @entity6 and allied forces in @entity1 , and because " we do not have the proper facility in @entity1 to detain him for longer than he is being held , " said capt. @entity18 , a @entity19 spokesman			2
a defense official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told @entity2 that the man was flown to @entity24 , which has the @entity6 military legal infrastructure and personnel to deal with the suspect			1
the @entity4 command in @entity0 said " some @entity1 officials " were alerted about the transfer before it was carried out			2
@entity1 's parliament has demanded a public trial for the suspect , but @entity6 officials said they will handle the investigation and prosecution themselves			1
the news came as @entity6 defense secretary @entity37 visited with troops at a base in @entity1 , calling sunday 's killings -- as well as the accidental burning of @entity42 by @entity6 troops last month and the deadly riots that resulted -- " deeply troubling			1
" " we have to learn the lessons from each incident so we do everything possible they do n't happen again , " @entity37 said , adding that the " tragic " incidents " do not define the relationship between the coalition forces and the @entity1 people			1
" and before meeting with defense minister @entity54 , @entity37 praised the performance of @entity1 authorities in responding to those incidents			1
" we 've been through some difficult events in the past few weeks , and yet the army and the police have been able to maintain order and have been able to control the situation , " he said			0
" and that tells me that you have gained a great deal of respect and trust with the @entity1 people , and that 's extremely important if we are to exceed in this mission of transitioning all of the areas in @entity1 to @entity1 control , governance and security			1
" @entity73 disarmed before @entity37 appearance @entity37 flew into @entity1 on wednesday , making him the first high - ranking @entity6 official to visit the country since the weekend deaths			1
@entity37 's two - day trip was scheduled long before the killing spree and does not include a trip to the area of @entity83 province where the killings took place			1
a huge explosion killed eight people wednesday in @entity89 province , which @entity37 was visiting , but he was not affected			2
the massive roadside blast ripped through a minivan , leaving its victims unrecognizable , the @entity89 government said			0
the government blamed " terrorists " for the bombing			0
in a separate incident , a motorcycle bomb exploded in @entity83 , killing an @entity1 intelligence agency security guard who was trying to defuse it , a government media agency said			1
three others , including a civilian , were injured			0
it was unclear if the bombing was related to sunday 's killings			0
the @entity106 have threatened to behead @entity6 in response to sunday 's shootings , which killed nine children , three women and four men in a pair of villages near a @entity6 outpost			0
@entity1 president @entity115 calling the shootings " acts of terror and unforgivable			2
" despite some protests and local violence , the country has not erupted the way it did last month when @entity6 troops burned copies of the @entity125 and other @entity127 religious materials			0
military officials said the materials had been seized from @entity1 prisoners because they contained extremist messages			1
president @entity132 called that incident a mistake and apologized for it , but those efforts did not head off riots and reprisal attacks that left at least six @entity6 troops and dozens of @entity1 dead			1
" the tragic events of recent days are a reminder that this continues to be a very difficult mission , " @entity132 said wednesday in @entity140 at a joint news conference with @entity143 prime minister @entity142			1
but , he added , " our forces are making very real progress dismantling @entity150 , breaking the @entity106 's momentum , and training @entity1 forces so that they can take the lead and our troops can come home			2
" at an upcoming @entity4 summit in @entity159 , " we 'll determine the next phase of transition , " @entity132 said			2
" this includes shifting to a support role next year , in 2013 , in advance of @entity1 taking full responsibility for security in 2014			1
" he vowed that the @entity6 and allies will take steps to be sure the transition does not " result in a steep cliff at the end of 2014 , but rather is a gradual pace that accommodates the developing capacities of the @entity1 national security forces			1
" he called for various factions in @entity1 " to end 30 years of war			2
" @entity142 said the transition to @entity1 control is under way			1
" we are now in the final phases of our military mission , " he said			1
once the combat role ends , " we 'll also back president @entity115 in working towards an @entity1 - led political settlement , " he vowed			2
@entity37 met wednesday with top @entity6 and @entity143 military leaders and spoke to a group of about 200 troops at @entity187 and @entity188			1
he then planned to travel to a nearby forward operating base to meet more coalition troops before flying to @entity0			0
his arrival came a day after @entity1 forces came under fire during a funeral for victims of the shooting rampage , while protesters angered by the killings blocked a major highway in the country 's southeast			1
the @entity106 -- who have battled @entity6 and @entity4 troops as well as @entity1 government forces since the 2001 invasion after the september 11 attacks -- issued a statement after sunday 's killings describing @entity6 troops as " sick - minded @entity6 savages			1
" they said they would take revenge " by killing and beheading @entity6 anywhere in the country			0
" the @entity6 military said the @entity11 sergeant blamed for the killings acted alone			2
two senior military officials told @entity2 that images from security cameras around his outpost showed the suspect leaving and returning alone to the base			2
there is another image showing him lying in a field			0
a separate military source said there is imagery showing the suspect " low crawling " through the area outside the base			2
the image was collected from what the official described as an aerial asset			0
the suspect then is shown getting up and walking back to the outpost , according to a senior @entity6 military official with direct knowledge of the information			1
the arrival and departure images were taken by base surveillance cameras			0
a military search party was put together to look for the missing soldier , but it 's unclear to what extent searchers got under way before he returned to the base , the official said			0
the soldier , whom the military has not named , has yet to be charged			0
he turned himself in to his fellow @entity6 after the killings and could face the death penalty , @entity37 has said			1
the officials have described the suspect as a staff sergeant from an infantry unit assigned to support @entity264 troops in @entity83 province , the @entity106 heartland and a leading focus of the @entity6 - led counterinsurgency strategy in @entity1			2
military authorities have presented a determination of probable cause to allow them to keep the sergeant in detention , an @entity270 official told @entity2			0
investigators are looking into whether alcohol may have been a factor in the attack			0
toxicology tests on the suspect are not complete , the two senior military officials said			0
the suspect served three tours of duty in @entity285 before being deployed to @entity1 , according to the @entity6 military			1
during the suspect 's last deployment , in 2010 , he was riding in a vehicle that rolled over in a wreck , according to a senior @entity19 official , who also spoke on condition of anonymity			0
after the wreck , the sergeant was diagnosed with traumatic brain injury but was treated and then found fit for duty , the official said			0
speaking tuesday at the @entity298 , @entity132 said he has told @entity115 that the @entity6 " takes this as seriously as if it was our own citizens and our own children who were murdered			0
" " the killing of innocent civilians is outrageous and it 's unacceptable			0
it 's not who we are as a country and it does not represent our military , " he said			0
a @entity6 military investigation " will follow the facts wherever they lead us , and we will make sure that anybody who was involved is held fully accountable with the full force of the law , " he added			0
