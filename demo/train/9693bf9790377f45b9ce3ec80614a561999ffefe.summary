@entity1 angles , fragmented glass , scaffolding , bright lights , looming robotics -- these elements tower over ghostly , apparition - like people scurrying to and from their destinations			0
in these images , amid bustling city of @entity13 , the overflow of people looks almost like rushing water -- no more than a fleeting presence			1
in a generation where photographs are taken to establish a person 's presence , marking where they are , where they 've been and whom they were with , photographer @entity18 's work takes a different approach			1
the people in his work have an evanescent quality			0
" the fact that the static elements , the city , the spaces , remain sharp , but the people are the ones fading -- it certainly is something that makes us question how our time is finite and how are we spending that time , " says @entity18			1
it is this very transient , otherworldly aspect of photography that 's captivated him			2
" when using longer exposures i 'm also capturing something that is only visible in a photograph , but yet we know it to be fundamentally true			0
" @entity50 , born to @entity52 parents in @entity53 , has had a deep - seated love for cultural exchange and expressing that through the medium of photography			1
this art form he says , allows him to capture a " given period of time in a single image , and in doing so it allows us a reflection that 's just a different experience			2
" reflection is exactly what @entity50 has been achieving with his work for over the past decade			1
on crowded city streets , a long exposure will only capture those who stand still for a moment			1
with the clear implications of mortality in his imagery , @entity50 stresses the importance of asking questions with his art as opposed to offering a solution or supplying answers			1
many of his previous works have focused on the use of technology in modern life and our interaction with humanity as a result			0
the project @entity13 , which was recently featured in the @entity95 gallery in @entity96 , took a different look at technology as the landscape in which people move around			1
what drew @entity50 to @entity13 was the dichotomy of a culture that was caught in a dance between past and present : holding onto traditions , ancient temples , festivals and ceremonies while embracing technology and modernism			1
places like @entity112 , are standard in the city			0
@entity50 describes the scene as a restaurant mixed with a rock concert and a nightclub			2
this loud , boisterous environment is a magnet for the younger generations			0
yet the older customs and generations still have a large influence			0
the two worlds collide when the cherry blossoms bloom			0
when the winter breaks and warm air is ushered in , and the first cherry blossoms bloom , an announcement goes out in the paper , marking the countdown till full bloom			0
and then the city stops everything else to focus with eager anticipation on preparing for the festivities			0
during full bloom all generations are accounted for -- out meandering on sidewalks and picnicking on the lawn			0
throngs of people are greeted by lanterns hanging from scaffolding at the first @entity144			0
even in the pouring rain the festivities continue , and as the blossoms fall from the trees , people stop to clap			0
those that stop to soak in the moment are the only ones that appear sharp in @entity50 's photographs			1
when capturing moments like this , @entity50 is guided by the available light			1
" what i love about using long exposures is that there is only so much i can anticipate about what the actual result is going to look like and the fact that i still am often surprised by the result is part of the magic to me			2
" social media follow @ @entity167 on @entity168 to join the conversation about photography			0
the element of surprise makes a shot more compelling for @entity50 -- reacting to the reality around him , instead of forcing his ideas onto the landscape			2
while most of photography is about asserting a human presence , the poeticism of @entity50 's work is that it echoes our sense of time passing			1
@entity18 is an @entity52 photographer based in @entity96			1
he is represented by @entity186 .			2

photographer @entity18 took long exposure photographs using only available light
@entity50 's project @entity13 was recently exhibited at the @entity186 in @entity96
