-- it turns out moviegoers want fire and ice this @entity5			1
both " @entity6 : catching @entity7 " and @entity8 's " @entity15 " are thriving at the box office , so much so that the films are on track to break records and achieve the two best @entity5 five - day weekends of all time			1
" @entity16 " earned $ 20.7 million on wednesday and $ 14.9 million on thursday			2
that $ 35.6 million haul puts the film on track for a five - day weekend of about $ 100 - 105 million , which will handily beat " @entity21 " $ 82.4 million gross over the same period of time in 2001			1
remarkably , " @entity16 " will have earned about $ 290 million after just 10 days of release , and if it keeps up this pace , it will easily outdo the original " @entity6 ' " $ 408 million domestic total			2
@entity0 : box office preview - ' frozen ' ready to storm the chart , but it wo n't beat ' catching fire ' " @entity15 " is more than holding its own against the behemoth blockbuster			1
@entity8 's animated musical pulled in $ 26.3 million on wednesday and thursday ( $ 15.2 million , then $ 11.1 million ) , a substantially bigger start than tangled , which grossed $ 19.9 million in its first two days in 2010			0
that film wound up earning $ 48.8 million over the following friday - to - sunday period ( 2.45 times its wednesday / thursday gross ) , and if we apply the same metric to @entity15 , it 's set to gross $ 64 million over the traditional weekend frame for a stunning $ 90 million five - day start			1
much less fortunate were the weekend 's two other newcomers , " homefront " and " @entity42 , " both of which got the cold shoulder from ticket buyers			0
the @entity48 vehicle " homefront " grossed $ 2.8 million over its first two days and may only find about $ 9.5 million in its first five			0
" @entity42 " fared even worse , with $ 1.1 million combined on wednesday and thursday , which may result in a $ 3.8 million five - day start			1
given the talent involved â € ” @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 â € ” and the proximity to @entity58 , that 's a major disappointment			0
@entity0 : box office report - ' @entity6 : catching fire ' breaks november record with $ 161.1 million debut " @entity67 " did n't draw huge crowds in its expansion into 1,234 theaters			1
the film pulled in $ 1.6 million on wednesday and thursday and looks to gross about $ 5.5 million through sunday , which will give it a $ 6.9 million total			0
" @entity71 " is n't taking off , either			2
@entity74 's @entity73 contender has grossed just under $ 1 million from 753 theaters in two days			0
no numbers for @entity78 's " oldboy " have come in just yet			0
check back tomorrow for another box office update â € ” and enjoy those @entity5 leftovers ! see the original story at @entity0			2
