ahead of me , a trail of lights snakes up toward the sky , moving relentlessly , step - by - step , in the darkness			2
i 've tackled quite a few mountains in my life , but never have i hiked with as many solemn spirits as on @entity10 in @entity11			1
@entity13 pilgrims are all around me			0
there are women , whose bangles can be heard rattling against tired ankles , and monks , pulling their maroon robes over their left shoulders to shield from the mountain chill			0
we 're all going up silently toward the summit of what is a holy mountain for @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 in @entity11			1
the 2,243 - meter ( 7,359 feet ) @entity10 lies among the island nation 's southern @entity30 , 150 kilometers ( 93 miles ) east of the capital @entity33			1
it 's one of @entity11 's highest mountains , rising like a green fang from a carpet of dense forest reserve where wild elephants and leopards still dwell			1
it is n't the scenery or wildlife that daily pulls in thousands of pilgrims though			0
all of them are here to see a 1.8 - meter - long rock formation that juts out from the summit			1
tough going to @entity26 , @entity10 , or the sacred footprint , is an imprint left by the @entity51 himself			1
@entity27 say it belonged to @entity54 while @entity29 and @entity28 consider it a sign of @entity58 's passage			2
local legend has it that @entity11 's @entity61 was the first to stumble upon @entity10 during a reign that ended in about 76 bc. the peak gets another historic name check from none other than @entity66 , who visited in the 14th century , reporting that his ascent was tough going			1
today , a stone staircase helps almost every @entity11 tackle the peak several times during their lives			1
from december to may , the mountain glows nightly as torchlit pilgrims follow the trail to the top			0
some climb in the afternoon to reach the shrine at sundown but the most popular and spiritual time to ascend is the middle of the night , summiting just in time to catch the first rays of dawn			2
just getting to @entity10 is an act of devotion			1
pure pilgrimage after traveling from the central city town of @entity89 to @entity90 on a slow train through the relentless greenery of the area 's @entity11 tea estates , i catch a rickety bus to continue my journey			1
my destination is @entity98 , a cluster of chai stalls , home stays and informal restaurants that marks the starting point of the five - kilometer @entity105 climbing route , the shortest way to the summit			1
the basic facilities on offer are attuned to the reasons for the climb			0
this is n't a leisure pursuit , but a pure pilgrimage			2
my ascent begins at a chilly 3 a.m. the climb can take between two and a half and four hours -- i 'm aiming to summit at the break of dawn at 6.30 a.m. groups of pilgrims dressed in white lead me through the dark and to the beginning of the incline			2
" each time feels like the first , " says @entity125 , a slender man from a village near @entity127 on @entity11 's southern coast			1
he and his wife are tackling their fifth climb , accompanying their six - year - old son for his first ascent			2
before the path starts rising , a monk from the nearby @entity138 temple comes forward and in exchange for an offering , ties a white string around my waist as a form of blessing			0
and so , with the eyes of one of @entity10 's benevolent gods hopefully on me , i proceed upward as the incline slowly turns into a stone staircase			1
spiritual awakening ? along the way , vendors cook pans of soothing chai over portable gas stoves			0
prices , like the sacred mountain , are steep			2
the peak comes into view a couple hours into the climb			0
many hikers greet it with determined expressions , their only goal to arrive at @entity10 before sunrise			1
as we get nearer , the darkness disperses in tones of blue			0
just before dawn throws shards of burning red across the sky , we sail into a sea of pilgrims surrounding the shrine 's platform			2
it 's quite a sight			0
pilgrims walk in circles reciting mantras , queuing up to pray before the sacred footprint			1
on the edge of the slope , young monks in wool hats hold their robes tight under their chins with chilled fingers , waiting for the sun 's rays to bring the new day			0
with the sound of tolling bells at my back , i join the line and watch first light over central @entity11			1
the spectacle is enough to stop my legs from aching and make me forget that i must , at some point , return to @entity202			0
getting there two daily trains leave from @entity89 to @entity90			0
@entity205 departs at 8:47 a.m. and arrives at 11:12 a.m. while number 1015 leaves at 11:10 a.m. and arrives at 13:26 p.m. buses run to @entity98 from @entity90 's train station until early afternoon			0
during pilgrimage season ( december to may ) , there are direct buses to @entity98 from @entity33 , @entity89 and @entity212			0
however , the scenic train route across the @entity214 is highly recommended .			0

the 2,243 - meter ( 7,359 feet ) @entity10 lies amid @entity11 's southern @entity30
hiking up @entity10 to see the sacred footprint near the summit at sunrise is a popular pilgrimage
the journey to get there is an *ordeal* that requires devotion
