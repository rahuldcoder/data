what is @entity53 ? body dysmorphic disorder is a chronic mental illness characterized by obsessive thoughts about flaws in one 's own appearance			2
those imperfections are minuscule or even imagined , but they cause patients great suffering because they feel so ashamed of them			2
one to 2 percent of the population is thought to have body dysmorphic disorder			2
a 2010 study in the journal @entity67 suggested that people with the condition have abnormal brain function when looking at pictures of their own face			2
some patients seek elaborate cosmetic surgery procedures , over and over , but it 's never enough			2
the condition is associated with symptoms of other mental illnesses such as depression , eating disorders , social phobia , anxiety and suicidal thoughts and behaviors			2
cognitive behavioral therapy helps some patients refocus their thoughts and see themselves in a more positive way			2
there are no approved medications specifically for the condition , but a doctor may prescribe antidepressants			2
but sometimes the condition can lead a person to attempt to harm himself or herself , or others , and requires hospitalization			0

to prepare , @entity19 practiced walking locally around @entity130 , @entity21 , between january and march , walking a total of 500 miles in a little over two months			0
a week into the walk , e-mails started coming to @entity19 from people affected by body dysmorphic disorder expressing their deep gratitude for his journey			1
he also met patients at the rally thursday			1

" i just know what they 're going through , it 's so , so difficult , and how lonely it must feel to them , and how they must get discouraged , " @entity19 said			0

" " here are people who are supporting me virtually , who are right there with me , and ca n't walk with me , but i could feel their energy , and i could feel that this mattered to them , " he said			1
@entity19 was walking by himself for the most part during the week , but on weekends people would join him -- his wife , his daughter , a cousin , his sister - in - law , other supporters			1
while he received many offers for accommodation from supporters , sometimes he would have to make last - minute decisions about where to stay , such as after a particularly grueling 28 - mile stretch when he did n't stop until he found a hotel			1
a young woman who had also been at @entity190 in @entity191 , @entity192 , at the same time as @entity100 , and who also had body - dysmorphic disorder , also reached out			0
she and @entity100 had often walked and talked together			0
after correspondence throughout the journey , she joined @entity19 in walking on wednesday from @entity190 on the same 13 - mile route that @entity100 had taken when he ran away from that hospital in early 2010 , when his father had combed the twisting streets of @entity12 trying to figure out where his son had called him from			1
@entity19 calculated that he took 1,110,000 steps on this journey			1
at his pace , he says , it was more than the anticipated 525 miles , more like 552			0
he 's not sure what he 's going to do next but feels he is being called to do advocacy work for this particular disease			0
