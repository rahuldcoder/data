-- the town of @entity2 , @entity3 , is putting saggy , baggy pants in the category of indecent exposure , with violators facing fines of up to $ 200			1
@entity2 mayor @entity10 said he plans to sign this week an amendment to the municipality 's indecent exposure ordinance			1
the amendment , which @entity14 plans to put into immediate effect at the @entity17 meeting , prohibits the wearing of pants or skirts " more than three inches below the top of the hips exposing the skin or undergarments			1
" " we 've gotten several complaints from citizens saying the folks with britches down below their buttocks was offensive , and was n't there something we could do about it , " @entity10 said			0
the mayor said after about a year of fielding complaints , he put the city attorney to work researching how other localities have dealt with the derriere dilemma			2
the result was that council members decided to put exposure due to baggy clothing in the same category as masturbation , fornication and urination in public places			2
patrolling for offenders will be left to local police in the town about 140 miles southeast of @entity49			0
violators could face fines ranging from $ 25 to $ 200 , or court - mandated community service			1
" that 's not our intent , we 'd ( rather ) not fine anybody but we are prepared to , " @entity10 said			0
@entity2 residents are divided on the issue			1
@entity60 supports the push to force folks to pull up , " it 's just disrespectful by showing your drawers to people , " she said			0
but there are those who feel that the ordinance singles out a specific group of citizens			2
@entity72 , who volunteers with young black men in the community said , " they 're the ones wearing the saggy , baggy pants			1
" @entity72 said she believes the ordinance will lead to profiling by authorities			2
mayor @entity10 said that accusation is " ridiculous			0
" " it 's for white , black , man , woman			0
the ordinance is for everyone , and i 've seen it violated by all races and sexes , " @entity10 said			0
@entity2 is not alone in its pull - up - the - pants campaign			1
@entity92 , @entity93 , and @entity94 , @entity95 , passed bans against sagging pants in recent years , but the @entity92 legislation later was declared unconstitutional after a court challenge			0
in the non-judicial realm , a state senator in @entity101 , @entity102 , announced plans earlier this year for a series of billboards featuring young men wearing low - hanging pants and the catchphrase , " raise your pants , raise your image			1
" and up the road from @entity2 , 62 - year - old @entity49 " general " @entity113 made it all the way to " @entity121 " and became an online one - hit wonder with his song " @entity119			2
" ( sample lyrics : " pants on the ground , pants on the ground / looking like a fool with your pants on the ground			0
" ) it is not lost on the mayor and the @entity17 in @entity2 that this ordinance opens the door to what could be a pretty tricky debate over what is indecent exposure			1
for instance , how much is too much cleavage , and are certain tattoos indecent ? the mayor seems to welcome the discussion as a natural part of the law - making process			1
" i do n't know a law or ordinance that does n't stand scrutiny by the people and the court system			2
there have been plenty of laws that have gone all the way to @entity155 , " @entity10 said			0
according to the mayor , the local high school already enforces a strict dress code which puts a tight belt around students and their saggy pants , sending violators home for the day			1
" it 's time we all have a mutual respect for each other ... what a person does in the privacy of their home is fine , " @entity10 said			0
" but if i had an 8 - year - old daughter , i do n't think she needs to be subjected to looking at someone 's rear end			0

the mayor of @entity2 , @entity3 , plans to sign an amendment to an indecent exposure ordinance
the law would *bar* the wearing of low pants or skirts " exposing the skin or undergarments "
@entity2 residents are divided on the new law
violators , meanwhile , could be fined up to $ 200
