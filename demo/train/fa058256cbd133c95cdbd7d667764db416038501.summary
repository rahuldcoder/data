-- @entity2 fans will have a new reason to cheer when the 101st @entity4 kicks off on saturday : 26 - year - old @entity5 will become the first rider from @entity2 to compete for competitive cycling 's highest honor			1
@entity5 , who will be riding with the @entity11 - based @entity10 team , has competed in professional @entity13 cycling since 2007 and has already completed other top races			1
" i am just really happy to race for my country in the @entity4 , i 'm really excited , " @entity5 , who comes from the northern @entity2 city of @entity16 , told @entity0			1
he 's dreamed of competing in the tour since he began racing			0
" when i started cycling in @entity2 , the @entity4 was the only race they showed on the tv , " @entity5 said from @entity20 , @entity21 , where the tour will begin			1
he 's happy that his friends and family will get to watch him compete			0
as @entity5 qualifies for one of the most famous races in the world , his example could help kickstart @entity2 's nascent competitive cycling scene			1
' @entity33 killer ' @entity5 started his athletic career as a runner in school , but shifted to cycling soon after in part because of the cold weather in @entity16 , where winter temperatures get below -4 ° f ( -20 ° c ) and cycling gave him the opportunity to train indoors			1
he started with track cycling -- in which racers do laps around a velodrome track on specialized bikes -- and then moved to longer distance road cycling			1
after training with a @entity50 team for a year , he was signed by @entity51 and moved to @entity13 in 2007			0
the @entity4 wo n't be the first milestone @entity5 has passed			2
he 's also competed in the other two highest profile races in competitive cycling : the @entity55 , in which he raced in 2012 and the @entity56 the following year			1
the three races collectively are known as @entity58 , and he is the first @entity2 cyclist to participate in each of them			2
@entity5 is known as a " breakaway killer , " which means he catches up with cyclists who try to get away from the pack of riders			0
it 's not the flashiest role , but it helps position his teammates on the nine - man squad to win races			2
he says he does n't have a strategy going into the @entity18			0
" my goal is to try my hardest for my team , and i hope i finish the whole three weeks			0
" giant - @entity10 coach @entity72 said in a statement that @entity5 played an important factor in the team 's formations			1
his participation in the tour " will be huge for him and his country and we look forward to seeing the impact this has on the globalization of the sport , " @entity72 said			0
@entity85 ? advocates hope that @entity5 's participation in the @entity18 could help competitive cycling gain attention in @entity2			1
" the fact that there is a @entity2 racer in the race means the media and the public will focus on it much more , " said @entity89 , the director of @entity90 , an organization affiliated with cycling 's governing body , that promotes the sport around the world			1
" @entity5 is a pioneer			0
" international teams currently compete in events like the @entity18 , a top - level annual race that will have its fourth edition in october			2
@entity5 and several of his @entity10 teammates competed in the race in 2013			1
but overall , international road cycling has n't gained much traction in the country			1
@entity2 won three medals in women 's track cycling at the @entity114 -- two silvers and a bronze -- but has lagged behind in road cycling			1
some cyclists aim instead for @entity2 's @entity118 , where athletes represent their regions or cities			2
cycling in general is also not as prevalent as it once was			0
@entity2 was known as the " @entity85 " in the 70 's and 80 's , when a bike was the main form of transportation for many			2
now , as more people have moved into the middle class , mopeds and automobiles have started to replace bikes on the streets of @entity132 and other cities , although there are still more than 8 million bikes in the capital city			2
poor air quality is also an obstacle for cyclists , who can face health problems from riding in smoggy urban centers			0

for these people , cycling is recreation , not a way to get to work			0
" there 's now more and more people who will strap an expensive road bike to the top of their @entity159 and head to the hills around @entity132 , " said @entity154 , a spokesperson for the @entity18			0
in the suburbs , the roads are smooth and the air is clean			0
" you will see literally hundreds , if not thousands , of people out there on the weekends riding their bikes , " said @entity165 , the co-founder of @entity166 , a @entity132 ngo promoting cycling culture			0
this cycling renaissance has even gotten support from the headline - grabbing billionaire @entity173 , who celebrated @entity2 's " @entity178 " in 2011 by smashing a @entity175 and giving his employees free bicycles			1
it 's also attracting the attention of professional cycling teams eager to find untapped talent , and cycling sponsors eying @entity2 's potential as a lucrative market			2
and @entity132 is looking to build a more competitive road cycling program for the @entity187 in @entity188			1
@entity5 's example could give more people a reason to get back in the saddle			2
" what @entity2 cycling needs is a national hero who performs well at an international level , " @entity165 said -- and that could be @entity5			1
for now , @entity5 is focused on the @entity18 , in which 198 cyclists , divided among 22 teams , will ride a total of 2,272 miles before the july 27 finish line			0
but he 's already thinking ahead			0
" i hope for the future we will send more and more riders to @entity13 pro races , " @entity5 said			0
" i hope they can use my experience to see that @entity13 cycling is possible			0
