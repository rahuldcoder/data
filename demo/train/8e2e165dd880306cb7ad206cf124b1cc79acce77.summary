@entity0 -- the @entity2 on tuesday passed a bill that would make suing for pay discrimination easier by altering a time limit on such suits			1
the act is named for @entity8 , seen here in 2008			2
her discrimination lawsuit victory was overturned in 2007			1
the @entity11 , which passed 250 - 177 , would give workers alleging unequal pay the right to sue within 180 days of their most recent paycheck			1
current law says such employees must sue within 180 days of receiving their first unfair paycheck			1
supporters of the new legislation say that , under the current law , an employer merely needs to hide unfair pay practices for three months before being able to continue them without penalty			2
the act , named for a former @entity28 employee who sued the company for gender discrimination in 1998 , would effectively overturn a 2007 @entity32 decision on the limit			1
@entity8 was awarded $ 360,000 in back pay by a federal judge in @entity36 , but the verdict was overturned in a 5 - 4 @entity32 ruling in may 2007			1
the court said that even though she filed her complaint within 180 days of when she first learned that she was getting paid less than comparable male employees , she had failed to file within 180 days of the first unequal paycheck			2
after tuesday 's @entity2 vote , speaker @entity43 said the chamber had " taken a bold step " in passing the legislation			0
" in doing so , it has injected fairness , reason and common sense back into policy , " @entity43 said			0
the legislation , which passed the @entity53 on thursday , now goes to president @entity54 , who has promised to sign it into law			1
it is the first major piece of legislation @entity59 has sent to @entity54 for his approval			2
on the campaign trail , @entity54 and @entity62 nominee sen. @entity61 debated the bill			0
@entity54 heavily emphasized what he called the plan 's benefits to working women , while @entity61 criticized it as a boon for trial lawyers			0
@entity43 said @entity54 called to congratulate her on the bill 's passage			0
@entity54 danced with @entity8 at one of his inaugural balls , and she spoke at the @entity77 @entity76 at which he accepted his party 's nomination			0
" my case is over -- i will never receive the pay i deserve , " @entity8 said in that speech			0
" but there will be a far richer reward if we secure fair pay for our children and grandchildren , so that no one will ever again experience the discrimination that i did			0

president @entity54 has promised to sign @entity11
act would alter time limit for pay - discrimination suits , makes them easier to file
limit would be based on date of most recent unfair paycheck , not the first
act named for woman whose discrimination victory was overturned in 2007
