@entity0 in @entity1 just lost their right to privacy			1
last week , a federal judge in @entity5 ruled that blanket , suspicion-less surveillance of @entity0 is permissible under the @entity1 @entity8			1
since september 11 , 2001 , the @entity9 has used community mapping , video surveillance , photography and confidential informants to map @entity15 life in and around @entity16			1
no detail has proved too remote for the prying eyes of the @entity9			1
mosques , student groups , restaurants , even grade schools , have all been surveilled			2
in 2012 , a group of @entity5 plaintiffs sued the @entity9 , alleging that the spying program chills religious expression and stigmatizes @entity15			1
the plaintiffs include an @entity28 war veteran , a prominent mosque and a math teacher			0
each was monitored by the @entity9 absent any evidence of wrongdoing			1
the judge , however , ruled the plaintiffs failed to prove discrimination , and found that monitoring @entity0 was the only way to stop terrorism arising from the @entity15 community			1
the court also dealt a damaging blow to whistle - blowers , ruling that the @entity43 revelations about the program caused the plaintiffs ' injury , not the @entity9			1
according to the judge , the harm to @entity15 communities was caused by overzealous journalists , not snooping cops			1
the most immediate effect of the decision is that it will deepen the isolation of @entity0 in @entity1			1
a report by @entity56 at @entity57 illustrates this sharply			0
many @entity0 in @entity16 live under an umbrella of fear			1
not because they have anything to hide , but because they want to be left alone , what justice @entity62 once called the right most valued by civilized men			0
they hesitate before speaking @entity67 or @entity68 in public , dither before attending religious services or joining faith based groups , and shy away from embracing emblems of faith , like hijabs and beards			0
not even students are immune from this incessant second - guessing			0
many vacillate before joining @entity15 groups on campus or speaking on controversial issues like religious profiling in the classroom			0
nor is the problem confined to @entity0 in and around @entity16			1
indeed , the court 's decision raises the specter of something far more ominous			0
what stops the federal government from mapping and monitoring @entity0 nationwide ? permitting dragnet religious surveillance of @entity15 communities will also exacerbate anti-muslim sentiment			1
the @entity9 spying program comes on the heels of a nationwide maelstrom against @entity15			1
more than a dozen state legislatures have considered legislation criminalizing sharia law			0
mosques have been burned and vandalized , and @entity0 have been the target of countless hate crimes			1
@entity102 has joined the chorus as well , with some members repeatedly overblowing the threat posed by home - grown @entity15 extremism			0
this widespread animus has led to a disturbing paradox : more @entity1 fear @entity15 today than just after the 9 - 11 attacks			2
still , it 's not just @entity0 who should be troubled by the court 's decision			2
it 's every @entity115 , for in its faulty reasoning , the court has also diminished the @entity1 @entity8			0
what if the @entity9 had mapped the state 's @entity115 population to stop criminal activity in that community ? the practice would be denounced and defeated in a court of law			2
why then , is religious surveillance tolerated ? race and religion both have a storied role in @entity115 history , and both are afforded similar protection under the @entity8			2
but , time and again , we ignore the enduring wisdom of the @entity136 , and succumb to political whim and social fiat			0
the @entity140 relocation camps after @entity141 ; the blacklisting and harassment of communist sympathizers during the @entity145 ; the surveillance of civil rights , feminist and anti-vietnam war activists throughout the 1960s and ' 70s ; and more recently , stop and frisk in @entity16			2
these policies once enjoyed widespread support and were considered necessary law enforcement tools			0
today , they are a stain on our national consciousness			0
religious surveillance of @entity15 communities will one day join this tragic , shameful legacy			2
but until then , the @entity5 plaintiffs have vowed to press on			0
they announced last week that they intend to appeal the court 's decision and vindicate their rights			0
in the end , they 're fighting for the @entity8 , and thus , you and me			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

a federal judge dismissed a suit *challenging* broad @entity9 surveillance of @entity0
@entity173 says the ruling *breaches* privacy , sustains fear among many muslims
he says the judge erred in blaming journalists rather than police for the harm caused
@entity173 : the targeting of @entity0 will be seen as a tragic *infringement* of civil *liberties*
