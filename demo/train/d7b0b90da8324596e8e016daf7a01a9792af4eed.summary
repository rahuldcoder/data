-- when @entity2 announced its 13 - inch @entity4 tablet tuesday , the company made an argument that one size does not fit all when it comes to touchscreen devices			1
but who will actually use such a large slab of mobile computing ? " the @entity13 is what we see as a home tablet , " @entity12 , a @entity2 spokesman , told @entity0			2
" the larger size makes it an ideal kitchen tablet			0
you can watch how - to videos while you 're cooking , or look up recipes			0
and then later , you can bring it into the living room to watch videos with the kids , or to look at family photos with friends			0
" thankfully , @entity2 is shipping the @entity4 13 , which runs on @entity30 's @entity29 4.0 operating system , with a stand that will relieve owners from having to hold , or prop up , the large device themselves			1
and despite being bigger than pretty much every other competing tablet on the market , the @entity4 13 is fairly thin and light for its size , @entity12 said , noting that it will weigh 2.2 pounds and measure 0.4 inches thick			1
nonetheless , anyone who 's watching the tablet market has to wonder why @entity2 is releasing a tablet behemoth in a world enamored with smaller devices			1
after all , the first tablet to gain any widespread consumer adoption other than @entity46 's @entity45 is the 7 - inch @entity47			1
and looking forward , the hottest rumors focus on an ipad mini and a 7 - inch tablet that would be @entity30 's next flagship mobile device			1
in short : @entity51 is in , and big is n't even part of the conversation			0
@entity54 , the ceo of @entity55 , a usability research firm , agrees that @entity2 is thinking about tablet design in a way that its rivals are n't			2
but @entity60 does n't agree that the world needs , or wants , a 13 - inch tablet			1
" this is the sort of typical maneuver of just adding another feature without improving the actual user experience , " @entity54 told @entity0			0
" it 's just bigger , and it 's not clear to me that anyone is asking for bigger			0
you can only get the @entity45 in one size and nobody is saying , ' @entity72 , it just feels a little too small to me			0
' " but while there seems to be no consumer demand for larger tablets , the use case of watching movies as a group , or flipping through photos with loved ones on the couch , on a 13 - inch slate is n't too hard to imagine , says @entity86 , principal at the @entity87 , a usability research firm			1
" if a small group of people is trying to use the tablet together , sitting on the couch and consuming content , this size makes sense , " @entity86 told @entity0			0
" but i do think [ the @entity4 13 ] might be a bit of overreach			2
i do n't think that people only need one computer			0
nowadays , most people have two computers , between a laptop and a smartphone			0
but where this @entity2 tablet fits in -- between those devices and the tv -- i 'm not sure			2
it 's not likely to be a big success			0
" spool also predicts that the @entity4 13 will be neither an @entity45 killer , nor a top - selling @entity29 tablet			1
" these types of enhancements are knee - jerk reactions from companies who are trying to ' out feature ' other companies , " he said			0
" but what this comes down to is that it 's not the specific technology in a tablet that makes it exciting			0
it 's the user experience			0
and there 's just a lot less to do on an @entity29 tablet than an @entity45			2
and what there is to do is much clumsier because the screen sizes and specs for @entity29 tablets are all over the place			2
a 13 - inch screen and a bunch of top specs do nothing to change that			1
" among the other specs the @entity4 13 touts are a quad - core @entity143 3 processor , @entity145 of @entity146 , a 5 - megapixel rear facing camera , and four rear - mounted speakers to blast audio from the tablet 's aluminum back			1
the tablet also sports a @entity154 — 900 screen resolution , a @entity156 port , a @entity158 port and a full - size sd card slot			1
the @entity13 sits at the top of a revamped tablet line for @entity2 , in terms of both price and screen size with a price tag of $ 649.99 for the @entity167 model , and $ 749.99 for the @entity169 model , when it hits stores in early june			2
for those looking for a more traditionally sized tablet that still packs a quad - core punch , @entity2 will also ship in june a 7.7 - inch version of the @entity4 ( known as the @entity4 7 ) at $ 499.99 for @entity176 of storage and $ 579.99 for @entity178			1
a 10 - inch @entity4 , dubbed the @entity4 10 , will ship in may for $ 449.99 with 16 gb of storage and $ 529.99 for the @entity178			1
the @entity4 range of tablets replaces @entity2 's old line of thrive slates , which were offered in both a 7 - inch and 10 - inch model			1
in case you 're wondering why is the @entity4 7 more expensive than the @entity4 10 , @entity12 explained : " smaller is harder to do			0
