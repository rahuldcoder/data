a majority of @entity2 voters rated mayor @entity3 positively in a new survey conducted largely before the shooting of two @entity7 officers this weekend that put @entity3 in the national spotlight			1
the survey , conducted by @entity10 , showed 53 % of city voters viewed him favorably , while 33 % viewed him unfavorably and another 10 % say they have n't heard enough about him to decide			0
the mayor is underwater statewide , however , with 36 % of @entity2 state voters viewing him unfavorably , while 33 % have a favorable view and another 29 % say they have n't heard enough to decide			1
the survey was conducted from dec. 17 - 21 , partly before the saturday shootings of two police officers in their patrol car in @entity23			0
the incident has inflamed already strained tensions between the mayor and the city 's police force , and complicated a nationwide debate surrounding law enforcement tactics and treatment of minorities			2
@entity33 has taken center stage in the aftermath of the shootings , calling on monday for unity and a hiatus from the protests that have gripped the city in recent weeks following the killings of two unarmed @entity43 men at the hands of white police officers			1
but the @entity10 poll showed that through sunday @entity2 gov. @entity47 , also a @entity48 , was widely seen as the more influential of the two in the state , with three - fourths of respondents rating him as such			2
more than half of the state 's voters view @entity47 favorably , while a third view him unfavorably			0
@entity2 sen. @entity57 , who is up for reelection this cycle , is also widely popular , with 62 % of the state 's voters viewing him favorably			1
and looking towards the 2016 presidential contest , the state 's former @entity62 senator , @entity61 , is still a strong favorite to win if she jumps in the race , as most expect			0
she leads @entity67 , the former @entity68 governor of @entity69 ; @entity71 sen. @entity70 and @entity73 gov. @entity72 by anywhere from 26 points with @entity72 to 35 points with @entity70			0
