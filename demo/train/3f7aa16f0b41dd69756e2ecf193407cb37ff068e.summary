editor 's note : @entity2 , president emeritus at @entity3 , is founder and president of @entity5 , a nonprofit organization that seeks to engage the public in debate over the effects of the 21 - year - old drinking age			1
@entity10 says the 21 - year - old drinking age is n't preventing widespread binge drinking			1
( @entity12 ) -- one year ago , a group of college and university presidents and chancellors , eventually totaling 135 , issued a statement that garnered national attention			1
the " @entity21 " put a debate proposition before the public -- " resolved : that the 21 - year - old drinking age is not working			1
" it offered , in much the way a grand jury performs its duties , sufficient evidence for putting the proposition to the test			2
it invited informed and dispassionate public debate and committed the signatory institutions to encouraging that debate			0
and it called on elected officials not to continue assuming that , after 25 years , the status quo could not be challenged , even improved			0
one year later , the drinking age debate continues , and new research reinforces the presidential impulse			1
just this summer a study published in the @entity40 revealed that , among college - age males , binge drinking is unchanged from its levels of 1979 ; that among non-college women it has increased by 20 percent ; and that among college women it has increased by 40 percent			1
remarkably , the counterintuitive conclusion drawn by the investigators , and accepted uncritically by the media , including editorials in the @entity50 and the @entity51 is that the study proves that raising the drinking age to 21 has been a success			1
more recently , a study of binge drinking published in the @entity57 announced that " despite efforts at prevention , the prevalence of binge drinking among college students is continuing to rise , and so are the harms associated with it			1
" worse still , a related study has shown that habits formed at 18 die hard : " for each year studied , a greater percentage of 21 - to 24 - year - olds [ those who were of course once 18 , 19 and 20 ] engaged in binge drinking and driving under the influence of alcohol			1
" yet , in the face of mounting evidence that those young adults age 18 to 20 toward whom the drinking age law has been directed are routinely -- indeed in life - and health - threatening ways -- violating it , there remains a belief in the land that a minimum drinking age of 21 has been a " success			1
" and elected officials are periodically reminded of a provision in the 1984 law that continues to stifle any serious public debate in our country 's state legislative chambers : any state that sets its drinking age lower than 21 forfeits 10 percent of its annual federal highway appropriation			1
but it 's not 1984 anymore			0
this statement may seem obvious , but not necessarily			0
in 1984 @entity99 passed and the president signed the @entity101			0
@entity102 , which raised the drinking age to 21 under threat of highway fund withholding , sought to address the problem of drunken driving fatalities			1
and indeed , that problem was serious			0
states that lowered their ages during the 1970s and did nothing else to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol witnessed an alarming increase in alcohol - related traffic fatalities			1
it was as though the driving age were lowered but no drivers education were provided			2
now , 25 years later , we are in a much different , and better , place			0
thanks to the effective public advocacy of organizations like @entity127 , we are far more aware of the risks of drinking and driving			2
seatbelts and airbags are mandatory			0
the " designated driver " is now a part of our vocabulary			0
and more and more states are mandating ignition interlocks for first - time @entity140 offenders , perhaps the most effective way to get drunken drivers off the road			2
and the statistics are encouraging			0
alcohol - related fatalities have declined over the last 25 years			1
better still , they have declined in all age groups , though the greatest number of deaths occurs at age 21 , followed by 22 and 23			2
we are well on the way to solving a problem that vexed us 25 years ago			0
the problem today is different			0
the problem today is reckless , goal - oriented alcohol consumption that all too often takes place in clandestine locations , where enforcement has proven frustratingly difficult			2
alcohol consumption among young adults is not taking place in public places or public view or in the presence of other adults who might help model responsible behavior			2
but we know it is taking place			0
if not in public , then where ? the college presidents who signed the @entity21 know where			2
it happens in " pre-gaming " sessions in locked dorm rooms where students take multiple shots of hard alcohol in rapid succession , before going to a social event where alcohol is not served			1
it happens in off - campus apartments beyond college boundaries and thus beyond the presidents ' authority ; and it happens in remote fields to which young adults must drive			1
and the @entity21 presidents know the deadly result : of the 5,000 lives lost to alcohol each year by those under 21 , more than 60 percent are lost off the roadways , according to the @entity195			1
the principal problem of 2009 is not drunken driving			0
the principal problem of 2009 is clandestine binge drinking			1
that is why the @entity21 presidents believe a public debate is so urgent			0
the law does not say drink responsibly or drink in moderation			0
it says do n't drink			0
to those affected by it , those who in the eyes of the law are , in every other respect legal adults , it is @entity211			0
the principal impediment to public debate is the 10 percent highway penalty			0
that penalty should be waived for those states that choose to try something different , which may turn out to be something better			0
but merely adjusting the age -- up or down -- is not really the way to make a change			2
we should prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol in the same way we prepare them to operate a motor vehicle : by first educating and then licensing , and permitting them to exercise the full privileges of adulthood so long as they demonstrate their ability to observe the law			2
licensing would work like drivers education -- it would involve a permit , perhaps graduated , allowing the holder the privilege of purchasing , possessing and consuming alcohol , as each state determined , so long as the holder had passed an alcohol education course and observed the alcohol laws of the issuing state			2
most of the rest of the world has come out in a different place on the drinking age			1
the @entity251 is one of only four countries -- the others are @entity255 , @entity256 and @entity257 -- with an age as high as 21			1
all others either have no minimum age or have a lower age , generally 18 , with some at 16			2
and , in their heart of hearts , they also know that a law perceived as unjust , a law routinely violated , can over time breed disrespect for law in general			0
slowly but surely we may be seeing a change in attitude			0
this summer , dr. @entity272 , a distinguished psychiatrist , a member of the presidential commission that recommended raising the drinking age , and the founder of the @entity278 admitted that supporting the higher drinking age is " the most regrettable decision of my entire professional career			1
" this remarkable statement did not receive the attention it merited			0
alcohol is a reality in the lives of young adults			1
we can either try to change the reality -- which has been our principal focus since 1984 , by imposing @entity211 on young adults 18 to 20 -- or we can create the safest possible environment for the reality			1
a drinking age minimum of 21 has not changed the reality			1
it 's time to try something different			0
it 's not 1984 anymore			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2			2

@entity10 : 135 college officers *joined* in *questioning* 21 as drinking age
he says binge drinking is *flourishing* in locked rooms and remote areas
he says @entity251 is one of very few countries with such a high drinking age
@entity2 says alcohol is a reality in lives of 18 - to 20 - year - olds
