days after being dropped from @entity2 's " @entity1 , " @entity0 fired back at that network , " @entity10 " and what he called the " @entity5 " in his signature style -- a song bellowing biting lyrics in between guitar licks			1
" this country sure as hell has gone down the drain , " @entity0 sings in a tune posted monday on his official website			1
" we know what we need			0
we know who to blame			0
" in the song , the 62 - year - old son of the legendary country singer @entity0 did not appear to accept any blame for his part in a recent controversy stemming from an appearance last monday on " @entity10 , " @entity20 ' morning show			1
on the program , he said that the golf outing involving president @entity30 and @entity32 speaker @entity31 , an @entity34 @entity33 , was " like @entity35 playing golf with ( @entity39 prime minister @entity38 ) @entity37			1
" when one of the @entity20 ' interviewers pointed out that @entity0 invoked " one of the most hated people in all of the world to describe ... the president , " @entity0 responded : " that is true , but i 'm telling you like it is , you know			1
that just was n't a good thing			0
it just did n't fly			0
" the next day , the singer offered an explanation , saying , " my analogy was extreme -- but it was to make a point			0
... the thought of the leaders of both parties jukin ' and high fiven ' on a golf course , while so many families are struggling to get by , simply made me boil over and make a dumb statement , and i am very sorry if it offended anyone			0
" then , last thursday , @entity2 announced that it " decided to part ways " with @entity0			1
his song " @entity69 " had been the " @entity1 " theme on both @entity71 and @entity2 since 1991			1
no remorse was evident in @entity0 ' latest song , titled " @entity74 " -- an apparent dig at @entity30 's 2008 campaign promise to bring change to @entity78			1
the singer has criticized @entity30 in the past , and he supported the 2008 @entity33 presidential ticket of sen. @entity81 and running mate gov. @entity82			2
@entity0 sang that he 'd keep his freedom , guns , money , religion and " my @entity88 name , " among other things			2
he added that he 'd like to " keep the government out of my business			0
" the singer said that he had expected to talk about his father 's new cd on the " @entity10 " program , and accused the show of playing " the gotcha game			1
" " ask for my opinion , then twist it all around , " @entity0 sang			2
" just wait and see , do n't tread on me			0
" @entity0 was born may 26 , 1949 , and his iconic father nicknamed him " @entity0 " after a ventriloquist dummy used by @entity103 , a country comedian , @entity0 ' website says			2
he debuted on the @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106 , at age 11			0
in addition to " @entity69 , " his other hits include " @entity110 , " " @entity111 , " " @entity112 , " " @entity113 " and " @entity114			0
" the bearded @entity0 , who wears a hat and sunglasses during performances , suffered facial and head injuries in a 1975 mountain climbing accident			0
at the end of his song posted monday , @entity0 urged people to " keep ' @entity10 ' and @entity2 out of your homes " in light of the flare - up			1
" because @entity0 and all his rowdy friends -- and his song -- is outta there , " he concluded .			2

@entity0 *compared* president @entity30 to @entity35 on " @entity10 "
@entity2 dropped use of his songs from its broadcasts , and he *apologized*
but there 's no remorse evident in a new song posted on @entity0 ' website
he blasts @entity2 , @entity10 and what he calls the @entity5
