@entity0 -- finding @entity3 leader @entity2 and rolling back a resurgent @entity4 are necessary steps toward winning the war in @entity7 , the top @entity9 commander there told a @entity12 committee tuesday			1
@entity2 remains at large more than eight years after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity14 and @entity0 that triggered the @entity7 war , and is widely believed to be hiding along the rugged border between @entity7 and @entity17			1
gen. @entity18 , the commander of @entity9 forces in @entity7 , said the world 's most wanted terrorist is " an iconic figure " whose survival " emboldens @entity3 as a franchising organization across the world			1
" " it would not defeat @entity3 to have him captured or killed , but i do n't think we can finally defeat @entity3 until he is finally captured or killed , " @entity18 told the @entity26			1
but he said if @entity2 is hiding across the border , " it is outside of my mandate			2
" in addition , he said , pushing back the @entity4 -- which allowed @entity3 to operate from @entity7 before 9/11 -- is a " prerequisite " for destroying the terrorist network			1
" to pursue our core goal of defeating @entity3 and preventing their return to @entity7 , we must disrupt and degrade the @entity4 's capacity , deny their access to the @entity7 population , and strengthen the @entity7 security forces , " he said			1
@entity18 's appearance before senators was his second round of testimony on @entity47 on tuesday , following a session with the @entity49 earlier in the day			1
@entity50 , the @entity9 ambassador in @entity51 , joined him in both hearings			1
both men were called to testify about president @entity55 's new plan for the @entity7 war , which involves the deployment of another 30,000 @entity9 troops and a july 2011 date for the beginning of an @entity9 withdrawal			1
@entity18 said the next 18 months will be " critical " to the war effort and said @entity9 forces must convince @entity7 that " we are going to win			1
" the @entity9 and its @entity64 allies must reverse the @entity4 's actual and perceived momentum and establish " contiguous security " around the country rather than the pockets that currently exist , @entity18 said			1
one advantage @entity9 troops have is that the @entity4 -- which ruled most of @entity7 before the 9/11 attacks -- remain largely unpopular among @entity7 and draw support only through the threat of violence			2
" i have never seen evidence that the @entity4 have popular support like a political liberation movement , " he said			0
in august , the general had cautioned that a failure to reverse @entity4 gains within 12 months could make defeating the insurgents impossible			0
but his testimony tuesday lengthened that timeline			0
" the sober fact is that there are no silver bullets , " he told the @entity84			0
" ultimate success will be the cumulative effect of sustained pressure			0
" @entity18 said he " participated fully in the president 's assessment and decision - making process " and fully supports @entity55 's decision			2
and @entity50 , whose leaked cables to @entity0 indicated that he opposed sending large numbers of troops to the conflict , told the @entity12 he is " 100 percent " behind the new strategy " with the refinement of the mission			2
" his initial questions , @entity50 told the @entity49 , were about the number of troops , the timeline for those troops , and the context in which those troops would operate			0
" the mission was refined , the ways forward were clarified , and the resources now have been committed to allow us to achieve the refined mission , " said the ambassador , a retired general who held a senior post in @entity51 before retiring from the @entity111			0
" with that , at this point in time ... i am unequivocally in support of this mission and i am exactly aligned with gen. @entity18 in moving forward now to vigorously implement the assigned mission			0
" both @entity50 and @entity18 went out of their way to minimize the differences in their views after reports of an @entity50 cable advising the president that @entity18 's plans to send more troops would be ill advised because of a lack of confidence in the government of @entity7 president @entity136			2
in their opening statements , both said they were honored to testify together and each called the other a friend			0
but more of those differences were seen when the men gave their predictions about the final outcome of the war			0
" i believe we will absolutely be successful , " @entity18 responded when the committee chairman , rep. @entity146 , @entity148 , asked the general point - blank about the chances for success of the @entity9 mission			1
earlier , in his opening remarks , the general had said , " the mission is not only important , it is also achievable			0
we can and will accomplish this mission			0
" @entity50 was more cautious , saying that " success is not guaranteed but it is possible			0
" but @entity18 emphasized that the july 2011 date is only a marker in the broader picture , and not a " major factor " in @entity9 military strategy			1
" i do n't view july 2011 as a deadline			1
i do n't believe it is a deadline at all , " he told lawmakers , later adding that he assumed a @entity9 troop withdrawal will begin at that time			2
" it is a solid decision the president has made and i operate under the assumption that we will begin to decrease our forces beginning in july 2011 , " the general said			1
@entity18 said that the influx of additional troops should bring " significant progress " in the war by next summer , and by next december he should be able to " lay out progress " and show evidence of success in a report he will present			2
" my expectation is the insurgency will be less robust in the summer of 2011 , significantly so , and it is also my expectation that the @entity7 security forces will be more robust , " @entity18 said			1
" i see confidently in the summer of 2011 that beginning the reduction of forces will be appropriate , the pace and scope of which needs to be conditions - based on how strong is insurgency at that point			0
" he said the @entity4 must not become " an existential threat " to the @entity7 government , " and thus to the @entity7 people			1
" " so rather than wipe out every @entity4 member , what we need to do is lower their capacity to the point where -- within their own means -- @entity7 can hold them from being a major threat to either their way of life or their government			0
" i think that , over time , that will cause the @entity4 to go away , to become irrelevant , and cease to exist , " he explained			0
at present , 68,000 @entity9 troops are operating under both @entity64 and @entity9 commands in @entity7 , and around 42,000 non- @entity9 forces are under @entity64			2
the @entity215 announced 1,500 more @entity216 would be deploying this month as part of the new strategy			0
last week , @entity64 secretary general @entity219 said that @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity226 member @entity224 are among at least 25 countries offering to send a total of 7,000 additional troops to @entity7			2
@entity1 's @entity230 contributed to this report .			0
