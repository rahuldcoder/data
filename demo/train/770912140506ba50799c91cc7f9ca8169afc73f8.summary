@entity0 -- they 're baaaaack			0
with apologies to @entity5 , it seems that rumors of the death of @entity9 's @entity8 were greatly exaggerated			1
in fact , i probably wrote that obituary myself , more than once			0
that 's how it looked in 2000 , when the @entity8 , known as @entity8 , lost the presidency to @entity15 of the @entity16 , or @entity16			1
it seemed even more certain in 2006 , when the @entity8 came in a distant third in the presidential election among the three major parties , behind both the conservative @entity16 and the leftist @entity21 , known as @entity22			2
it seemed that the @entity8 , which controlled the presidency for 71 years and became synonymous with violence and corruption , was on the road to extinction			1
but the party has made a comeback			0
as expected , the top vote getter in @entity9 's presidential election on sunday was @entity8 candidate @entity33			1
the 45 - year - old former governor of @entity9 's most populous state , the one with the matinee idol good looks and the movie star wife , got about 38 % of the vote			1
@entity22 candidate @entity40 came in second with about 32 %			0
the @entity16 's @entity42 got just 25 %			0
this is despite the fact that @entity33 's public image took a lot of hits during the campaign			1
in december , the candidate struggled at a literary fair to name three books that had influenced him			0
when he was criticized for the flub by the country 's intelligentsia , his daughter poured gasoline on the fire by insisting , on @entity58 , that the story was driven by class envy			0
later , in an interview with a @entity63 newspaper , @entity33 admitted that he did n't know the price of a package of tortillas			2
when criticized for being out of touch , he insisted chauvinistically that he was n't " the woman of the household			0
" he also admitted in another interview that he was unfaithful to his late wife and fathered two children with two women during his marriage			0
these tidbits normally tantalize the media			0
but @entity9 's version of @entity78 , led by the gargantuan multimedia company @entity79 , has been a big fan of @entity33			1
their cozy relationship was one of the things that , in recent weeks , drove hundreds of thousands of student protesters into the streets to protest the candidate 's likely election and the fact that the elites who run @entity9 seemed to be ramrodding @entity33 into office			1
the @entity93 is @entity9 's liberal version of the tea party , challenging the establishment and determined to be heard			1
even former president @entity15 crossed party lines and endorsed @entity33 , against the @entity16 's own candidate , @entity42			1
that maneuver only solidified the cynical view of many @entity9 that the fix was in , and that the two major parties are more alike than different			2
still , many voters fell in line			0
now , after 12 years of being on the outside , the pri - istas are back in power			0
not that they were ever far from it			0
at various times in the last decade , even when it did n't hold the presidency , the @entity8 kept control of the @entity113			2
the party also used this control to thwart reforms pushed by @entity117 and his successor , @entity118			0
as many @entity9 see it , the @entity8 was always plotting its retaking of the presidency , even as it overhauled its brand and tried to overcome a legacy of corruption			1
has that legacy been overcome ? it 's hard to say			2
some @entity9 seem willing to believe that this is not their father 's @entity8 and that the party of today bears no resemblance to the one that was run from office a dozen years ago			1
but the more common view seems to be that , despite the makeover , the party is as corrupt as ever -- a fact that voters seem willing to overlook if it can steer the country to safer and more tranquil waters			1
judging from what they 're telling reporters , @entity9 are looking for a leader to grow the economy , turn @entity9 into a first - world country , and , most of all , stop a war with the drug cartels that has in the last 5½ years resulted in the deaths of more than 50,000 @entity9			1
that is the @entity8 's promise			1
the party racked up major victories in the 2009 midterm elections by insisting that it could provide prosperity and security			1
that 's code for : " elect us , and we 'll stop the drug war			2
" but can it deliver ? i doubt it			0
what started nearly six years ago as an offensive by the government against the drug cartels has now morphed into a messy turf war between rival gangs eager to gobble up the country one city at a time			0
my sense is that the @entity8 could n't stop the war , even if it wanted to			2
besides , if you listen to what @entity33 has been saying in the last several weeks about combating drug violence , it sounds like what the @entity9 people typically hear from @entity118			1
consequently , most experts do n't expect a dramatic shift in the drug war or how the government goes about fighting it			0
shortly after winning , @entity33 told the @entity185 that while he is committed to reducing the violence , " there will be no pact or truce with organized crime			2
" for those of us who believe that this is a righteous cause and a battle worth fighting , one that affects countless lives on both sides of the border , that 's good news			2
meanwhile , we 'll have to wait and see whether the election of @entity33 turns out to be good news for @entity9			1
join us on @entity205 / @entity204 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			0

*projections* show @entity33 of @entity8 will become @entity9 's next president
@entity208 : @entity9 are *aware* that the @entity8 may be as corrupt as ever
he says voters can overlook @entity8 's legacy of corruption if the party can provide security
@entity208 : we 'll have to wait and see if @entity33 will be a good leader for @entity9
