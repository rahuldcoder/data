-- like a put - upon hotelier trying to fix a decrepit property while simultaneously dealing with demanding guests , the decline of print and rise in peer - reviewed websites like @entity5 have given travel guide publishers a big headache			1
" it 's easier for smaller publishers ( to cope with changing times ) , " says @entity11 , travel publishing analyst			1
" they 're much fleeter of foot ; it 's not like they 're an ocean liner that has to be turned around			0
" according to @entity11 's @entity23 , sales of printed world travel guides have declined by over 40 % in the last seven years			1
but building a successful brand in the travel guide business can still be achieved , although it can mean more than just providing a hit - list of must - sees			1
from a company that was based on " dirty weekends " in @entity30 , @entity31 & mrs @entity33 hotel guides have been doing their best to make a clean break from what went before			1
set up by @entity39 couple @entity38 and @entity40 ten years ago , the luxury guidebook has carved a niche in a crowded marketplace by appealing to a particular demographic			1
" it all started after a crappy weekend in a hotel in the @entity46 ( in @entity30 ) when i was trying to impress @entity40 , " says @entity38			0
" we realized there were n't really any guide books that were talking to a 30 - something audience			2
" as hotels upped their game to appeal to a more stylish clientele who could afford weekends away from the weekly grind , @entity38 and @entity40 saw an opportunity			0
remortgaging their house to produce and publish the first guide to these hip new hotels was the first challenge , but finding a receptive publisher and distributor was almost harder			0
" the first book was nearly impossible , publishers did n't understand our idea and said another luxury guidebook was n't needed , " says @entity38			0
" we thought naively that we could ring up @entity68 ( bookshop ) and turn up with the car boot open with boxes of books , saying , ' how many do you want ? ' " but as soon as we got it out there , it was phenomenal			0
we 've never really had to try too hard to get hotels on board since			0
" what they have had to do however is adapt to a rapidly changing travel environment , from the way people plan and book their holidays to what they want from a guide book			2
" many guides have reinvented their business models , becoming online booking services or increasingly doing business - to - business operations and looking to online advertising , " says @entity11			1
" the brand these days is all important			0
" now with a 24 - hour travel booking service , @entity31 & mrs @entity33 has morphed into something neither @entity38 or @entity95 -- who have visited over 1,000 hotels over the last ten years -- could have envisioned when they began			1
" we 're now starting to learn a new part of the travel business			2
the thing it get most nervous about is note expanding into other areas , but that the integrity of the business is intact			0
" personality and standing out from the crowd also helped the diminutive @entity108 punch above their weight and gain a foothold in the international travel guide business			2
founder @entity113 champions his guides ' snippy and snarky style and credits it with the guide 's success			2
" we 're aiming at a very targeted , solvent but time poor readership , scorning the word comprehensive and going right for opinionated jugular , " he says			0
rather than the internet dilute the appeal of the guide or its money - making potential , @entity113 believes it has helped niche publications like his own			1
" inevitably , the online and digital markets have and are revolutionizing all aspects of how we travel , research and respond to travel trends			2
the travel guide market has become much more specialized , rather than trying to appeal to the widest audience , " he says			1
@entity113 says that nearly 1.5 million @entity108 have been sold since launch , while @entity38 and @entity40 have no intention of doing away with their print editions , looking to @entity138 and @entity139 as the next places for their global expansion			0
@entity11 has also seen something of a rebound in the printed travel guide market , primarily he says as some players have simply stepped out of the game leaving a larger share for those who have weather the storm			1
" do n't write print off just yet			0
last year many players have disappeared from the market altogether and for some of those that have stayed they 've even seen some gains in sales , " he says .			1

*emergence* of peer - review travel websites have had a *negative* knock - on *effect* on travel guides
sales of global travel guides have declined by over 40 % in the last seven years
still a strong market for niche travel guides like @entity31 & mrs @entity33
