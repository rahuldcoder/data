-- more than 200 people were reported killed in @entity4 , hours before the @entity2 was scheduled to meet and likely vote on a draft resolution intended to pressure the government there to end its months - long crackdown on demonstrators , diplomats said			1
the meeting was scheduled to start at 10 a.m. et saturday			0
it was not clear which way @entity13 , a veto - wielding permanent member of the @entity2 , would vote			1
the opposition @entity16 said early saturday that 217 people , including women and children , had been killed in @entity20 in what the group characterized as a " massacre			1
" " the @entity2 is n't doing anything about it			1
the @entity25 is n't doing anything about it ... while they 're having their little discussion , people are sitting here and they 're dying , " said an activist @entity0 is identifying as @entity27			1
" these are n't animals here			0
these are human beings , " he said			0
" this is n't a game ... this is actually going on			1
" of those killed in @entity20 , 138 were in the neighborhood of @entity39 where " shelling continues , " according to the opposition group			1
" a massacre happened in @entity20 today , " said @entity42 , a resident			2
" there are so many people on the streets that are wounded and they need help , but we ca n't reach them to help them			2
" he described " continuous bombing " and reported the presence of snipers			0
" they 're ready to kills us all			0
they have no problem with doing that			0
please , we call ( on ) the international community for help , " @entity42 told @entity0			0
state - run @entity4 tv denied reports that the army shelled neighborhoods in @entity20			1
" this is a media campaign that uses fabrication , falsehood and escalation ... in order to affect a decision at the @entity2 and cover crimes and attacks committed by armed terrorist groups , " it said			1
before the reports of shelling in @entity39 , the @entity76 , a network of opposition activists , said that at least 31 people were killed across the country on friday , including three children and three defected soldiers			1
@entity0 can not independently confirm opposition or government reports from @entity4 because access to the country is limited			1
meanwhile , a rights group said in a report friday that @entity4 army and security officers detained and tortured children with impunity during the past year			1
@entity94 urged the @entity2 " to demand that the @entity4 government end all human rights violations			1
" @entity4 must also be made to cooperate with monitoring teams sent by the @entity25 and the @entity99 , the global monitor said			2
" children have not been spared the horror of @entity4 's crackdown			2
@entity4 security forces have killed , arrested , and tortured children in their homes , their schools , or on the streets , " said @entity103 , children 's rights director at @entity94			1
the organization said it has documented at least 12 cases of children detained under inhumane conditions and tortured , as well as children shot while in their homes or on the street			0
a @entity2 meeting on @entity4 ended thursday evening without agreement on the text of the draft , according to @entity121 ambassador @entity120			1
the draft of the resolution discussed thursday had dropped demands from an @entity25 plan for @entity4 to form a unity government and for president @entity127 to delegate power to his deputy			1
" we had what i would characterize as sometimes difficult but ultimately useful discussions , " @entity130 said			0
" we 're still working			0
" she said the @entity136 , who submitted the original draft , would come back with another version that could be voted on			0
" in any case , there are some still complicated issues that our capitals will have to deliberate on and provide each of us with instructions on			0
" before the talks , @entity25 secretary general @entity145 said that even a watered - down resolution would pressure the @entity4 government			1
@entity2 diplomats said the changes reflected a big concession to @entity13 , which has been reluctant to sign on to any plan that could be seen as a mandate for regime change in @entity155 , as occurred in @entity156 after it signed a resolution calling for a no - fly zone			2
@entity13 , which has said it is concerned about the prospect of a @entity4 civil war and does not want @entity127 pushed from power , has made clear that it will not accept an arms embargo or economic sanctions			2
a call for other nations to follow the @entity25 members in adopting measures such as sanctions against @entity4 had also been dropped from the latest version of the draft resolution , which demands the @entity4 government allow the delivery of humanitarian aid and guarantee the freedom of peaceful demonstrations			1
it also calls for an " inclusive @entity4 - led political process			2
" @entity121 and @entity179 diplomats insisted that the revised text still fully endorsed the @entity25 plan and that it did not need to spell out every detail to have the same meaning			0
" it will still put pressure on the @entity4 government , because they realize that @entity13 can not stand up forever			0
and they are under great pressure now			0
and , you know , @entity13 does not want to be against the people , " @entity145 said			0
in october , @entity13 and @entity190 issued a rare double - veto of a resolution that lacked sanctions but would have condemned the violence in @entity4			2
at least 7,100 people , including 461 children , have died since the start of the @entity4 uprising in march , according to the @entity76			2
the @entity199 estimated in december that more than 5,000 people have died since march			0
but the global body has not been able to update that figure because of the insecurity			0
@entity0 's @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report .			0
