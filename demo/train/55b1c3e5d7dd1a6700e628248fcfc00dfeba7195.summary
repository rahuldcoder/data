-- the @entity2 's proud slogan -- " world 's greatest deliberative body " -- seems out of place in the current atmosphere where distrust and bitterness dominate and persuasion and freewheeling debate seem like relics of a bygone era			1
but on wednesday , senators will take small steps aimed at restoring their " deliberative " functions when they take up a minor , non-confrontational , bipartisan bill providing block grants for child care programs			1
what separates this bill from any other in recent memory is that @entity24 leaders , who control the floor , wo n't dictate what amendments get debated and put up for a vote			2
they 've refused to do that in the past , fearing @entity30 would load bills with unrelated " gotcha " amendments designed to punish @entity24 politically			0
it 's the refusal to allow amendments that has infuriated @entity30 and led to so many of the @entity30 filibusters that have clogged the @entity2 floor in recent years			1
and those filibusters have , in turn , angered @entity24 , and contributed to their controversial decision last year to change @entity2 rules over the objections of @entity30 to limit filibusters			1
the idea of returning to an open amendment process is the brainchild of a bipartisan duo -- sen. @entity46 , a @entity47 of @entity48 , and sen. @entity49 , a @entity30 of @entity50 -- who have privately worked together for weeks trying to figure out how to lower the political temperature and restore some of the important traditions of the @entity2			1
after all , the @entity54 wanted the @entity2 to be a place where the hot debate of the @entity57 cooled like a saucer cools tea			2
@entity46 , who never shied from the tv lights as he climbed the ranks of leadership , has been noticeably lower key in the last couple of years and has made strides to work across the aisle on a number of tough issues			0
@entity49 , who has had a varied career in and out of government , recently left the third - ranking post in @entity30 @entity2 leadership saying he wanted to do more to bridge differences between the parties			2
so on wednesday , their experiment will be tested -- sort of like falling blindly back into each other 's arms			0
the child care bill will be put on the floor without any of the procedural hurdles that are commonplace now			1
it will then be up to the two bill managers , sen. @entity84 , a @entity85 @entity47 , and sen. @entity86 , a @entity87 @entity30 , to work out which amendments will get votes			0
if someone tries to force a vote to defund @entity94 or put new sanctions on @entity96 , ( two issues @entity24 leaders refuse to consider right now ) the effort likely will collapse			0
if amendments are non-controversial and relevant to the child care bill , it should pass			1
during this election year , when tensions between the parties are likely to worsen , senate majority leader @entity101 has said he wants to put bills on the floor that have been voted out of committee with the support of the @entity24 chairman and the ranking @entity30			0
bipartisan bills dealing with sentencing reform , energy efficiency , and manufacturing innovation fit that description and could be considered next , a @entity24 aide said			0
the success of wednesday 's controlled demonstration may determine if the effort continues			0
@entity119 says @entity120 spied on @entity2 computers @entity30 win first election showdown of the year			2

effort led by two senators aims to restore some *semblance* of deliberation
they *'ll* try to get things going on a non-controversial child care bill
@entity2 has been *gripped* by partisan *battles*
