it 's bad enough that we have to fear identity thieves who are trying to scam us with malicious messages sent from @entity6 we now must worry about being targeted by our household appliances , as well			0
an internet - security firm has discovered what they are calling a global cyberattack launched from more than 100,000 everyday consumer gadgets such as home - networking routers , televisions and at least one " smart " refrigerator			1
it 's being called possibly the first proven cyberattack to originate from connected appliances -- the so - called " @entity19			2
" @entity20 said the attack occurred between december 23 and january 6 , and featured waves of malicious e-mail targeting businesses and individuals worldwide			1
in a post on the @entity20 site , the company said the scam involved more than 750,000 e-mails from more than 100,000 appliances that had been commandeered by " thingbots , " or robotic programs that can be remotely installed on digital devices			1
it was not immediately clear friday which victims were targeted and whether the scammers were successful in collecting any personal information			0
" bot - nets are already a major security concern and the emergence of thingbots may make the situation much worse , " said @entity38 , general manager of @entity20 's information security division			1
" many of these devices are poorly protected at best and consumers have virtually no way to detect or fix infections when they do occur			1
[ we ] may find distributed attacks increasing as more and more of these devices come online and attackers find additional ways to exploit them			0
" recent years have seen an explosion in the number of devices fitted with internet connectivity , from eyewear to toothbrushes to refrigerators and beyond			0

and poorly protected " smart " devices may be easier to infect and control than pcs , laptops or tablets			1
a sophisticated hack was not needed to compromise the appliances in this attack			0
instead , the use of default passwords left the devices completely exposed on public networks , according to @entity20			2
the company also noted that connected appliances typically are n't protected by anti-spam or anti-virus software , nor are they routinely monitored for security breaches .			2
