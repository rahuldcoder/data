-- an emperor penguin discovered thousands of kilometers away from @entity5 with a bellyful of sand is recovering after an endoscopy monday , a @entity2 zoo official said			1
the procedure removed " much of the gunk that was in his stomach , " including " rocks , sticks and stones , " said dr. @entity15 , manager of veterinary science at @entity17 , where the bird was taken for treatment			2
the penguin has also been passing sand			1
the penguin -- whose gender is unknown pending dna test results -- stunned passers - by last week when it showed up at a beach north of @entity27			2
" this is only the second time an emperor penguin has been seen in @entity2 , " said @entity28 , spokeswoman for the @entity17			1
even more surprising was what the zoo found inside the penguin -- enough sand to fill its stomach and esophagus			1
" in @entity5 , they normally eat ice to cool down and to hydrate , " @entity28 said			2
it 's possible the bird mistook or tried to substitute the sand for snow or ice			1
it 's unclear why the penguin apparently swam more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,864 miles ) from @entity5			1
@entity15 said the bird might have gotten lost in a current , or perhaps its internal radar went awry			2
@entity2 have dubbed the penguin " @entity48 , " a reference to the 2006 animated movie about emperor penguins			1
but those at the @entity17 are steering clear of giving the bird a name			1
" we get very fond of our patients			0
if you start naming them , it 's really hard if the worst were to happen , " @entity15 said			1
the bird has undergone multiple stomach flushes , but getting all the sand out remains a challenge , @entity15 said			2
" having sand in your stomach is very serious , " she said			0
" it can cause a rupture , that 's my main concern			0
... i would assume the sand has abraded the stomach lining			0
" hundreds of zoo visitors watched the endoscopy monday and heard live commentary during the procedure			0
@entity15 said emperor penguins normally eat rocks to help them digest , " but he went way overboard			0
i think he mistook it for snow to cool him off			2
" the zoo currently has four little blue penguins , which are native in @entity2 , @entity28 said			1
all have been rehabilitated ; one is missing an eye , and one is missing a flipper			0
but taking care of an emperor penguin is an entirely different story			1
the bird 's temporary quarters include air conditioning set as cold as possible and shaved ice to help the emperor stay cool			1
keeping the bird at the zoo permanently is n't feasible			2
not only would building an exhibit to house an emperor penguin be extremely expensive , the wild bird is " a very social animal			1
we would need more ( penguins ) , " @entity15 said			0
@entity15 said the top priority is helping the bird recover			0
if all goes well , representatives from the @entity27 zoo , @entity2 's @entity104 and other experts will decide where the penguin should go			1
@entity15 said she hopes the bird will be able to return to the wild			0
in the meantime , the penguin has garnered widespread attention and sympathy			0
" i think people have a real soft spot for penguins , " @entity15 said			0
" everyone feels really sorry for him			0
he 's just so lost			0
" @entity0 's @entity118 contributed to this report .			0
