a young @entity2 woman who saved three of her relatives by nursing them back to health after they contracted the ebola virus is coming to the @entity8 to finish her nursing degree			0
after a story about @entity12 ran on @entity0 in september , many people wanted to help her			1
a nonprofit group called iamprojects.org also got involved to try and help finish her education			0
the news comes as @entity17 announced wednesday that its " @entity19 " honors go to the @entity21 fighters , the " unprecedented numbers " of doctors and nurses who responded when @entity21 overtook an already - weak public health infrastructure this year in @entity25			1
@entity17 's 2014 @entity19 @entity27 is not named in the article , but she definitely holds a place among those being honored			0
the 22 - year - old , who was in her final year of nursing school earlier this year , single - handedly took care of her father , mother , sister and cousin when they became ill with @entity21 beginning in july			1
and she did so with remarkable success			0
three out of her four patients survived			0
that 's a 25 % death rate -- considerably better than the estimated @entity21 death rate of 70 %			1
@entity12 stayed healthy , which is noteworthy considering that hundreds of health care workers have become infected with @entity21 , and she did n't even have personal protection equipment -- those white space suits and goggles used in @entity21 treatment units			1
instead , @entity12 invented her own equipment			1
international aid workers heard about her " trash bag method " and taught it to other @entity55 who ca n't get into hospitals and do n't have protective gear of their own			1
every day , several times a day for about two weeks , @entity12 put trash bags over her socks and tied them in a knot over her calves			1
then she put on a pair of rubber boots and then another set of trash bags over the boots			1
she wrapped her hair in a pair of stockings and over that a trash bag			2
next she donned a raincoat and four pairs of gloves on each hand , followed by a mask			1
it was an arduous and time - consuming process , but she was religious about it , never cutting corners			0
@entity81 spokeswoman @entity80 said @entity12 is amazing			1
" essentially this is a tale of how communities are doing things for themselves , " @entity80 said			0
" our approach is to listen and work with communities and help them do the best they can with what they have			0
" two doctors for 85,000 people she emphasized , of course , that it would be better for patients to be in real hospitals with doctors and nurses in protective gear -- it 's just that those things are n't available to many @entity104			0
no one knows that better than @entity12			1
her @entity21 nightmare started july 27 , when her father , @entity107 , had a spike in blood pressure			1
she took him to a hospital in their home city of @entity112			0
a bed was free because a patient had just passed away			0
what no one realized at the time was that the patient had died of @entity21			1
one woman walked in , and the @entity21 nightmare began @entity107 , 52 , developed a fever , vomiting and diarrhea			1
then the hospital closed down because nurses started dying of @entity21			1
@entity12 took her father to @entity127 , the capital city , about a 90 - minute drive via difficult roads			2
three hospitals turned him away because they were full			0
she took him back to another hospital in @entity112			0
they said he had typhoid fever and did little for him , so @entity12 took him home , where he infected three other family members : @entity12 's mother , @entity137 , 57 ; @entity12 's sister , @entity139 , 28 , and their 14 - year - old cousin who was living with them , @entity143			1
guilty of @entity21 until proven otherwise while operating her one - woman ebola hospital for two weeks , @entity12 consulted with their family doctor , who would talk to her on the phone , but would n't come to the house			1
she gave them medicines she obtained from the local clinic and fluids through intravenous lines that she started			0
at times , her patients ' blood pressure plummeted so low she feared they would die			0
" i cried many times , " she said			0
" i said ' @entity159 , you want to tell me i 'm going to lose my entire family ? ' " but her father , mother , and sister rallied and were well on their way to recovery when space became available at @entity168 on august 17			2
@entity143 never recovered , though , and passed away at the hospital the next day			0
" i 'm very , very proud , " @entity12 's father said			2
" she saved my life through the almighty @entity159			0
" her father immediately began working to find a scholarship for @entity12 , so she could finish her final year of nursing school			2
but the @entity21 epidemic shut down many of @entity2 's schools , including hers			2
with some help , @entity12 applied to @entity180 in @entity181 , the campus with the hospital that has successfully cared for @entity8 @entity21 patients			1
@entity180 accepted the young woman so that she could complete her nursing degree starting this winter semester			0
in order to attend , iamprojects will have to raise $ 40,000 to pay for her reduced tuition rate , living expenses , books and her travel and visa so that she can travel between @entity25 and the @entity8			2
@entity12 's father has no doubt that his daughter will go on to save many more people during her lifetime			2
" i 'm sure she 'll be a great giant of @entity2 , " he said			0
@entity21 patients left to lay on the ground @entity0 's @entity201 , @entity202 , and @entity203 contributed to this report .			2

@entity12 , 22 , nursed four family members infected with @entity21
she protected herself using trash bags , rubber boots , gloves and a mask
her protection method is being taught to others in @entity25
