-- as much of the @entity3 was trapped in a winter wonderland not unlike its snow - cursed setting , @entity2 's @entity1 managed to reclaim the no. 1 spot at the box office for the first time in three weekends			1
the animated film took in $ 20.7 million , which is a nearly 28 percent drop from last week 's numbers but still impressive considering it 's no longer a holiday and the film is already in its sixth weekend of wide release			1
it 's now inevitable that the @entity2 hit will cross the $ 300 million mark , as it 's currently sitting pretty at $ 297.8 million			1
that 's $ 97 million more than 2010 ′ s tangled -- @entity2 's previous @entity21 - animated adaptation of a fairy tale with a past participle for a title — made in its entire domestic run			1
meanwhile , @entity1 's worldwide total has reached $ 639.9 million			1
much like the first snow , the first shameless sequel of the year is a milestone that came early in 2014			0
but paranormal activity : the @entity31 , the @entity33 - marketed spin - off and fifth film in the popular horror franchise , could n't quite possess the top spot with its shaky - cam scares			1
the movie took in $ 18.2 million in its opening weekend , which is a whopping 38 percent less than its predecessor @entity40 made in its first few days out and the lowest ever debut for a @entity30 film in wide release			2
for the last half - decade , @entity44 has been wringing this series for all its worth — @entity30 5 hits theaters this october — and the returns appear to be diminishing			0
moviegoers also seem to be growing a bit tired of the movies ' limited bag of tricks : despite receiving generally better reviews than @entity55 , @entity53 rated a step down with @entity57 , from c to c -			0
still , this is a cheap goose and even if it switches from laying golden eggs to silver ones , it 's fine for the studio			0
after three weeks at no. 1 , @entity65 : the @entity66 tumbles like a dwarf in a barrel to third place with $ 16.3 million			1
so far , the second episode of @entity72 's trilogy is n't reaping quite as big a pile of gold as the first : @entity75 comes out of its fourth weekend with a healthy $ 229.6 million , but that 's still $ 34.2 million less than @entity77 had at this same point last year			2
the first @entity65 took in a grand total of $ 303 million domestically , which means the second one most likely wo n't make it past that three - double - zero mark			1
if that ends up being the case , it would be the first of @entity72 's @entity87 films not to do so			0
@entity89 's @entity88 of @entity90 takes a decent bite out of the box office with $ 13.4 million , bringing the total for @entity89 's coke - fueled tale of stock - pushing sybarites to $ 63.3 million			2
there 's a very good chance @entity89 's latest will surpass @entity100 's disappointing total domestic take of $ 73.9 million , showing @entity101 prefer their @entity89 to be decidedly un-family friendly			2
meanwhile , @entity103 's @entity102 , which features more than a wink to @entity89 's signature aesthetic , is nipping at @entity88 's back paws			0
it rounds out the list with $ 13.2 million , as @entity110 's critically acclaimed ensemble dissembles its way to $ 88.7 million			2
frozen - $ 20.7 million 2			0
paranormal activity : the @entity31 -- $ 18.2 million 3			1
the @entity65 : the @entity66 - $ 16.3 million 4			1
