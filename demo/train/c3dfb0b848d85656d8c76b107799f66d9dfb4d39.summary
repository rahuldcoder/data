@entity0 -- @entity2 voted for @entity3 and does n't have a job			1
but he 's spending his money to go to @entity7 's inauguration			1
the recent college grad has been selling his blood plasma for $ 40 a week to afford the trip			1
and while @entity13 , an eighth - grade @entity14 teacher in @entity15 , is in better financial shape , teaching is n't exactly a high - paying job			1
still , he saved for the @entity19 bus ticket to get from @entity15 to the nation 's capital			1
they are all 20 - somethings who are in @entity0 for @entity7 's second inauguration , despite the costs during a shaky economy and their political differences			1
each of them feels his voice matters to an administration that will shape the future			2
" i believe it is very important for politicians to listen to people our age			2
we communicate in a much different way than generations past , " said @entity2 , 28			2
the number of e-mail blasts from the @entity7 campaign and the president 's social media presence suggest the @entity44 knows that			2
so do comments from one senator in the @entity48 about why there will be extra temporary cell phone towers during monday 's events			2
" last time around , the sheer number of people ... overloaded the system and many cell phones in the crowd just could n't get a signal , " said sen. @entity52 of @entity15 , who chairs the @entity53 , in a statement			2
" the inauguration is a once - in - a - lifetime experience ... so we 're putting measures in place to make sure people can call , tweet , @entity68 and document their experience on smart phones and social media			1
" @entity2 , an @entity72 student at @entity73 , said he 'll be tweeting about his @entity0 experience even though his candidate lost			2
" the change of heart is not necessarily one of agreement or change in political views , but rather one of support for my president			1
... i feel it is terribly important that we come together , unified			1
" he 's been saving for weeks for the trip from @entity88			0
he pulled together $ 15 for the ticket and hopped the @entity90 from @entity88 to @entity0 for the short trip			0
he suspects most @entity92 have doubts about @entity7 's political agenda , but " respect and support are different than agreement and doubts , " @entity2 said			1
as an unemployed student , he is ready for change in the economy			0
like @entity2 , @entity8 knows the anxiety that comes with trying to save money			1
his @entity68 friends are vocal about the taxes coming out of their paychecks			0
he 's working more hours to make ends meet			0
he even planned to carpool with his mother and siblings from @entity110 for the big event			0
he used to direct the money he got from selling blood to his education fund			1
since november , he 's been setting it aside to get from @entity110 to the inauguration			1
" i have to work some magic to get off ( work ) , " said @entity8 , 25			0
" it 's definitely worth it			0
" @entity13 , thinking about his students in @entity15 , really wants to watch @entity7 take the oath of office			0
" in my experience , presidents are about one of two things : power or people			0
... although i 'm young , ( @entity7 ) seems to be the first who is genuinely committed to people , " @entity13 said			0
he tells his students that they are a part of a legacy and requires them to keep up with world events			0
" they need to start looking outside of themselves and their country , " said @entity13 , 29			0
" they have the power and the voices that can steer this country a certain way			1
" @entity13 , @entity8 and @entity2 seem certain about the importance of younger voices in political decisions			1
we are instantaneous , and we are the generation of the social media boom , " @entity2 said			0
" we have defined what it means for a cause or message to go viral , and are driven by the ability to do so			0
for that , politicians should listen closely to the pulse of the next generation ... now			0
