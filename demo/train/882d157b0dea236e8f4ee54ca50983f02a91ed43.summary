-- are technology companies ailing ? @entity2 certainly is			1
the venerable behemoth announced it will implement a restructuring that includes eliminating 27,000 jobs			1
@entity2 tried to bring itself around by replacing its ceo last year			1
that did n't quite do the trick , so now it 's resorting to the good old - fashioned mass layoff			0
one suspects that @entity2 is a little too venerable			1
it was the first " @entity11 spinoff , " fittingly reflected in the presence of @entity13 and @entity14 in the engineering corner of the @entity11 campus			0
yet @entity2 has n't stayed ahead of the innovation curve , failing for instance to adapt well to the tablet craze			1
this could be the end of an era			0
consider two @entity11 neighbors of @entity13 and @entity24 -- @entity25 and the @entity26			0
@entity28 ' company may be losing the innovation war , too			0
it 's getting pummeled by the tablets as well , and just this week @entity34 's @entity33 web browser overtook @entity36 's @entity35 in popularity			0
by contrast , the @entity38 was funded by @entity40 , whose firm @entity41 has been revolutionizing the supercomputer field			0
but wo n't those laid - off @entity2 engineers be snapped up by the booming tech sector ? many will not			1
the tech job market is excellent for younger workers , but many of those who are laid off and over 35 will find the market less welcoming			1
they 're perceived as too expensive			0
the @entity2 layoff will consist disproportionately of older workers			1
indeed , jettisoning the veterans is often the hidden agenda in mass layoffs			0
it 's no coincidence that many of the @entity59 core engineering openings at @entity2 have titles like @entity61 , all aimed at the younger crowd			1
the difficulties of older techies have been investigated statistically in studies at @entity67 and the @entity68 , but a very public human face was placed on this recently in an online town hall meeting with president @entity71			0
the wife of electrical engineer @entity73 explained to the president that her husband has never found a permanent job after being laid off by the electronics giant @entity76			1
granted , family issues restricted him to the @entity79 area , but if the hype regarding a seller 's market for engineers were true , @entity73 should have been able to find something in that region , which sadly has not been the case			1
a former student of mine was a star at @entity2 for 10 years or so , acquiring patents and promotions			2
yet he , too , got caught up in a huge layoff , and could find engineering work only sporadically afterward			0
ultimately he left the field			0
those who survive this round of @entity2 layoffs will likely find themselves being asked to not only do their own jobs , but also those of the departed			1
engineers are exempt employees , hence no overtime pay , and @entity2 will accrue a net reduction in labor costs			1
another tried and true fix for a sick firm ( and for the well ones ) is to ship work abroad			0
a few years ago , @entity2 executive @entity109 made it plain : " a basic business tenet is that things go to the areas where there is the best cost of production			2
" @entity2 's jobs web page shows that 48 of the 113 open core engineering positions are outside the @entity59			1
unlike @entity121 's explicit position on cheap labor , former @entity2 ceo @entity119 said that @entity2 offshores work because the @entity59 educational system does n't develop good math skills in its students			2
that claim is a red herring			0
@entity2 workers , including those being discarded , are among the best in the business , and were whizzes in math when they were in school			1
many of our technology leaders , from @entity13 to @entity138 , are products of the @entity59 school system			0
the offshored operations often require @entity59 - based workers to make periodic site visits			2
survivors of the @entity2 layoffs who always wanted to visit @entity147 may now get their chance -- monthly			2
to her credit , @entity2 's current ceo , @entity149 , conceded that layoffs " adversely impact people 's lives			2
" but she insisted that the action is necessary			0
probably so , but the message here is that engineers , like many others , will have to get used to a life of layoffs in a globalized economy			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			2

@entity2 announced it will eliminate 27,000 jobs
@entity163 : many laid - off @entity2 employees will not have an easy time finding jobs
he says tech job market is great for young workers , but not for older , experienced workers
@entity163 : engineers , like everyone else , need to adjust to the *realities* of a global economy
