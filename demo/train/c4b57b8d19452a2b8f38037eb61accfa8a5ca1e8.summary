@entity0 , @entity1 -- a moderate @entity4 party appears to be heading toward victory as votes are counted in @entity1 's first parliamentary elections since constitutional reforms in the summer			1
the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) won at least 80 seats , interior minister @entity9 said saturday , with at least 288 seats out of 395 counted			0
the party 's secretary general @entity13 said the party had won more than 100 seats			1
even the lower figure of 80 would give the @entity10 more seats than any other party , according to the @entity1 government 's website			1
the next biggest winner was the @entity24 , with 45 seats , that website reported			0
the number of parties involved in @entity1 's multi-party system means no single party is likely to win a majority of the seats , so a coalition government would have to be formed			1
@entity34 secretary of state @entity33 offered her congratulations saturday " on the successful completion " of the elections			1
" the @entity34 stands ready to work with the new parliament and the people of @entity1 to strengthen the rule of law , raise human rights standards , promote transparent and accountable governance , and work toward sustained , democratic reform , " she said			2
turnout in the @entity47 country was 45 % , the @entity44 said friday			2
the @entity48 -- which had 41 accredited observers from 21 countries that went to over 200 polling stations on friday -- said in a press release that the elections " were conducted transparently			1
" the voting process was described as " technically sound " and " without fear of tampering or procedural violations			0
" but one institute member , @entity59 leader @entity58 , also pointed to the turnout and a number of invalid and spoiled ballots as negatives			2
" seeing the number of people who actively spoiled their ballots as well as those who did not participate , it is clear that the path to real change will take more effort and time , " @entity58 said			0
@entity73 , senior lecturer in @entity74 at the @entity75 in @entity76 , said friday that the outcome might signal whether the population is happy with the monarchy or not			0
the more votes for the @entity10 appear to indicate a desire for greater change , she said -- as opposed to votes for the bloc of traditional loyalist parties , which would suggest voters favor the status quo			2
under the new constitution , approved by referendum in july , both @entity88 and the prime minister have greater powers , while the monarch 's sway has been slightly lessened			1
the changes mean the prime minister must now be chosen from the party that wins the greatest number of votes -- which , based on the preliminary results , would be the @entity10 -- rather than @entity100 selecting his own nominee for the job			1
the reforms came after thousands of @entity1 took to the streets to demonstrate earlier this year , inspired by what became known as the @entity106			0
the youth - based february 20 movement called for jobs and an end to corruption its members say stems from royal cronies			0
analysts say economic reform is needed to create more jobs for the country 's young people , particularly many university graduates who are unemployed			0
