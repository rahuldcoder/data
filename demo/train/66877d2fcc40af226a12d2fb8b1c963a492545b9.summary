-- if you 're like me , rose lovers , you were perfectly content to watch " the bachelor : @entity6 and @entity5 " from the comfort of your own couch			1
but a few weeks ago , i received word that 84 - year - old @entity4 superfan — and occasional @entity4 correspondent — nanny , wanted to be there to witness @entity6 and @entity13 's special day			1
clearly , i had to make this happen			2
after telling the good people at @entity17 and @entity18 about @entity19 ( and sending them some links to her brilliant commentary , like this , and this , and this ) , they knew there was simply no way this wedding could proceed without her			1
and so @entity19 and her daughter @entity29 packed their bags and flew from @entity33 to @entity34 , where i met them at the @entity36 two hours before the ceremony began			2
as we waited to be escorted to the garden where the ceremony was being held , we watched a steady stream of former @entity4 and @entity42 contestants — @entity43 and @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 — filter through the lobby in their formal attire			0
bachelor ring master @entity51 made an appearance , as did @entity6 's fellow @entity55 contestants @entity54 and @entity56			1
" we really bonded on @entity55 , " @entity56 told us			1
doing the show , he said , was " like being in the basement with someone during a hurricane			0
we bonded because we were in hell ! " eventually some black - clad crew members ushered us outside into a sort of patio / holding pen area , where guests drank wine and huddled around space heaters			1
fortunately this gave us some time to snap lots of pictures of @entity19 with some of her favorite citizens of @entity75 , including @entity43 and @entity44 , @entity48 and @entity76 , @entity45 and @entity46 , @entity77 and @entity78 , and @entity79			0
( " i like @entity79 real well , " she purred after the handsome race car driver was out of earshot			0
) by this time it was about 5:15 pacific time , so the broadcast had already begun on the east coast , and the producers were having guests file into the ceremony in groups during the commercial breaks			1
once at our seats , we were instructed not to sit down , because periodically the camera would go live to host @entity93 — who was standing atop a platform in front of the rows of seats — and i guess seeing a bunch of people sitting down behind him with their backs to him would have looked odd on tv while guests waited for the big event to begin , they chatted with each other and shivered in the chilly , 56 - degree night air			1
it was so cold that eventually @entity54 wrapped her little dog @entity112 — yes , she brought @entity112 — in a blanket			1
@entity45 and @entity46 took a selfie , while nearby @entity77 insisted that pregnant @entity115 — former @entity42 @entity116 , who 's now married to @entity119 champ @entity118 's brother — sit in the cushioned arm chair in their row rather the regular hardback chair			1
later @entity116 , @entity45 , @entity77 , and @entity124 gathered together to pose for a @entity42 all - star snapshot			0
we were n't allowed to sit down until about 6:15 , when @entity6 and @entity13 's grandparents walked down the aisle			1
shortly after that , three crew members stood at the altar — two of them clasping hands and one of them " officiating " — to give the camera team and lighting crew a chance to make sure everything was in order before the happy couple arrived			0
next , @entity6 appeared and strode down the aisle with his mom , @entity140 , and dad , @entity141 , who accompanied him up to the altar to officiate			1
it was time for the endless procession of bridesmaids and groomsmen , and as they arrived guests could hear the director barking orders and giving feedback to his team			2
" they came out really fast and they 're talking to each other ! " he barked into his headset after the first couple proceeded down the aisle			2
once the entire party was assembled , it was time for the big moment ... a commercial break ! when the cameras were n't rolling , guests resumed their conversations and checked their phones , while @entity6 stood quietly at the altar , his eyes fixed on the arch at the end of the garden where his bride - to - be would emerge			1
finally , the music began to play ( a tropical - sounding instrumental version of @entity174 's " @entity173 " ) and @entity13 arrived , flanked by her parents			1
though guests were asked to keep their phones away during the ceremony , i spotted several folks taking stealth videos and snapshots , including @entity79 , who leaned over his seatmate ( and former rival for @entity186 's love , @entity187 ) to get a shot of @entity6 and @entity13 taking their vows			1
the majority of the ceremony aired on tv , though part of it continued through a commercial break , as @entity141 led the guests in a prayer for @entity6 and @entity13			2
" we pray , @entity198 , that you will strengthen their love day by day , " he said , adding that he hoped for them to live as " ambassadors for @entity204			0
" during this lovely moment , a cameraman ensconced in the bushes to the right of the stage let out a loud burp — his second of the night — but i 'm hoping it was drowned out by @entity141 's amplified voice			2
despite the long wait for the ceremony to begin , it apparently did n't take long enough to fill all two hours			0
after @entity6 and @entity13 were declared man and wife and the processional filed back down the aisle , the director 's voice rang out : " how much time do we have to kill ? " though all of the guests were thinking please @entity225 do n't let it be more than a minute because we are freezing ! , the director informed us that we should move into the aisle and " mingle " so that @entity93 could interview @entity78 and @entity77 on camera about the beautiful celebration of reality tv romance they had just witnessed			1
and with that , it was a wrap for the fourth ever @entity4 / @entity42 franchise wedding			2
and @entity19 , for one , was over the moon			0
" i think it was something extra special that @entity6 's dad did the service , " she told me			2
her eyes were shining , and i asked her if she cried during the ceremony			0
" of course ! " she answered			0
" and i 'm not wiping these tears off ! " ( much like @entity242 , who 'll never wash her cheek again			0
) her magical evening was n't over yet , though			0
as we were leaving the garden to go back inside , ever - gallant host @entity93 approached us to say hello and pose for a picture with @entity19			0
" i think you should be the next bachelor , " @entity19 told him			2
but @entity19 , we asked , who would host the show without @entity48 ? " i 'll host the show ! " she replied			0
( your move , @entity252 ! ) just before we left the hotel to go back to our regularly scheduled lives , @entity19 offered two final thoughts on the evening			0
" if i die tomorrow , i 'll die with a smile on my face , " she told us			0
and then , " i need to slip @entity6 my business card with my phone number on it ... just in case it does n't work out			0
