it has been a starting point for some of the world 's top soccer players			1
as youngsters , the likes of @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 all played in the @entity13 youth tournament in @entity14			1
known as " @entity15 , " the 40 - year - old competition is contested by under - 16 national teams over @entity18 , with an event also held for club sides			2
leading @entity14 clubs @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 are all involved this year alongside another lesser - known name -- @entity29			1
its a team that will showcase the very best of @entity33 's talent , but which also aims to open young @entity36 players ' eyes to the risks of seeking their fortunes in @entity40 's top leagues			1
the team has been put together by @entity42 ( @entity42 ) -- a @entity43 - based charity which campaigns against the dangers of the trafficking of young players by unscrupulous individuals ; be they former players , businessmen , lawyers or unlicensed agents			1
" i 've heard a lot about less ethical agents bribing parents , and i have no doubt about the methods , " one agent , who asked not to be identified , told @entity53			0
" i know of agents using the parents ' '' money weapon ' ( promising them untold riches ) , kind of ' selling ' the player to an agent or organization			0
" how many times was i offered that option ? not only agents though			0
an agent can not do anything without a club at end of the line			0
" the movement of @entity36 players to @entity40 is long established			2
@entity77 clubs generally regard @entity36 players as athletically and technically gifted			2
arguably just as importantly , they are relatively cheap to develop , with the added potential that clubs can make a large profit if they are sold in the future			0
for the players , the idea of becoming of a professional footballer in @entity40 holds the promise of a better life for themselves abroad and their families back home -- if they are not discarded by clubs and left to fend for themselves			1
smuggling players @entity42 's founder is @entity96 @entity95 , who has already helped hundreds of youngsters return home after they were left stranded in @entity40			1
often they have been brought to @entity40 on an illegal passport , frequently taken first to eastern @entity40 , where it is easier to arrange a visa before moving them on to @entity105 countries			0
@entity106 estimates each year as many as 700 youngsters leave @entity108 alone to seek a professional career			2
but if the club does n't sign the player the youngster is left to his own devices as to how he returns to @entity33			1
" to bring young players to this tournament is a very good experience for them , " the 39 - year - old @entity95 , who played for a number of lower league @entity14 clubs , told @entity53 , as he explained the reason behind entering in the @entity119 tournament			1
" very few can become professionals and our goal is to explain how hard to become is to do so			0
it 's important to dream , but they must realize how few players there are in the professional world			1
" at one stage @entity42 was monitoring nearly 1,000 boys dumped in @entity14			2
it believes these youngsters were taken from hundreds of football academies in @entity33 -- ones that do n't recognize basic child protection issues -- by clubs desperate to unearth the next @entity138 , @entity139 or @entity140			1
" when i brought players from @entity33 -- either for trial or on a contract -- i always faced a huge problem : visas , " added the anonymous agent , referring to players over the age of 18 rather than minors , as he detailed the complexities of such transfers			1
" and i am talking of a period when things were easier , that is , 10 years ago			0
" i visited consulates with players trying to get a visa -- and i had to present the proper paperwork such as invitations and return tickets , etc. -- otherwise the player 's application would not even be considered			1
" however the agent said he did once manage " to smuggle " a player out of his home country @entity108			0
" he had already gotten a visa -- the @entity170 consulate would only grant a tourist visit once a year -- so i had to find a way to get him out again , " the agent said			2
" @entity174 being a modern airport i decided to fly from @entity176 , where the lights at the airport were dimmer			0
it was an amazing experience because in order to get to the plane we passed through four security controls			0
" the last one was at the plane 's door -- and lights were stronger than in @entity174 -- and i had made a ' change ' on his stamped visa			2
we managed to pass this last obstacle anyway and the player made a reasonable career			0
" money , money @entity29 's team for this year 's @entity119 tournament is made up from players from @entity108			1
more than 500 players have been assessed since january , before their 25 - man squad was selected			0
those players , who have been preparing for the tournament at a training camp in @entity25 , came from as many as 100 training centers in @entity108 , which have all signed up to @entity42 's objectives to protect the young players who are being trained			1
its charter is designed to provide the players with the best possible training environment , and it recognizes world governing body @entity213 's regulations as well as the @entity215 @entity214			1
@entity106 estimates @entity42 is working with as many as 2,500 players -- this on a miniscule budget of just over $ 100,000			2
" we do n't have salaries and we rely on volunteers , " he said			0
" we have a very important network of partners and we rely on very small donations			0
but we need help -- our organization has been in existence for 13 years			0
" @entity229 can just be business , business and money , money			0
people forget about education and the protection of young players -- football should not be above the law			1
" @entity106 recently featured in a documentary film called " @entity241 " that traced the journey of two @entity36 footballers -- @entity33 's @entity244 and @entity96 @entity245 -- as they attempt to fulfil their dreams of playing professional football in @entity40			1
at the age of 18 , @entity244 signed a professional contract with @entity252 club @entity251 , though he is back now in @entity33 with @entity253 , where he is the team 's captain			1
@entity245 was trafficked to @entity33 as teenager after he and his family were promised " riches beyond their imagination , " before he was abandoned in @entity43			2
" @entity264 has been a bit off the radar for the last few weeks , " said @entity259 , managing director and chief executive officer of @entity261 , the production company behind the film			0
" but following a series of injury setbacks he and ( @entity268 club ) @entity267 -- where he eventually signed in 2010 -- agreed to terminate his contract last year			2
" he is still signed up with @entity273 sports agency and they are hopeful of finding him another club in @entity40 for next season			0
" @entity259 said @entity95 and @entity42 " work tirelessly on a shoestring budget to provide support and education to vulnerable and exploited young @entity36 footballers " , despite a lack of interest and funding from the wider football community			0
" i have had the privilege of working with @entity95 in the making of @entity241 and i would say that he is a genuine hero -- working for little reward beyond his love of the game and , more importantly , his deep respect for the human rights of all men , women and children			1
