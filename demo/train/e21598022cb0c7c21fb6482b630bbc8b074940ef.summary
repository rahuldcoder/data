-- last weekend , the ensemble relationship comedy " @entity1 " opened to an astonishing $ 33.6 million , exceeding practically everyone 's expectations , including those of one of the film 's standout stars , actor - comedian @entity9			1
" i knew the movie was going to do well because it was tracking well , " he tells @entity0 , " but we were thinking in the range of $ 20 - 25 [ million ]			1
when in came in the 30s , that was a little mind - blowing			1
for me that just shows the power of social media			1
@entity9 has practically built his entire career harnessing the power of his @entity20 feed and @entity22 page to drive audiences to his films			1
last september , his stand - up comedy feature " @entity25 " opened to $ 2 million on just 97 screens , a feat he largely credited to his social media fan base spreading word and supporting the film			1
for " @entity1 , " @entity9 notes that , combined , the entire cast boasts well over 20 million @entity20 followers			1
" so we got together and just did a blitz ourselves ...			1
when you 're doing movie promos and there 's billboards and stuff , yeah it 's out there , and you know people see it			1
but we were getting direct responses because of @entity20 and @entity22			1
" of course , a movie 's number one debut is not built on tweets alone			1
@entity9 credits three other diy efforts for helping catapult his film to the top of the box office : multitasking ! as part of his stand - up comedy tour , @entity9 started screening the trailer for " @entity1 " at the beginning and ending of every set			1
" because i was doing arenas , i was [ performing ] for 15 - to - 20,000 people a night			2
i was reaching anywhere from 60 - to - 90,000 people through the course of a week			2
" making a scene ! earlier this year , @entity9 created a media kerfuffle when he got himself ejected from the @entity68 all - star celebrity game -- and then was still named mvp			1
" yeah , first celebrity to ever get ejected from a celebrity game , " says @entity9 with a hearty chuckle			1
he swears his outburst was n't premeditated -- " i literally was having a good time and being myself " -- but he 's not ashamed at taking advantage of the situation either			2
" all press is good press , " he says			2
" all the attention it got , it became ' @entity9 from " @entity1 " ... ' -- not just ' @entity9			1
' and the story just got bigger			2
" giving away free popcorn ! " i love to pop up at the movie theaters , " says @entity9			1
" i love to treat the people who are there			2
' guys , whoever meets me at the 3 p.m. showing at " @entity89 " ' -- or wherever city i 'm at -- ' popcorn and soda on me			2
' literally just showing your fans your appreciation			2
i would n't be where i am now if it was n't for their support			2
so i 'm not the type of person who can turn my back on that support			0
i try to do little things to show that i 'm not only appreciative of it , but i do n't take it for granted			0
i 'm humbled by it			0
it 's amazing to me			0
" chances are very likely , meanwhile , that @entity9 will have another film of his hit number one at the box office this weekend : the romantic comedy " the five - year engagement			1
" he 's already planning his social media blasting for the week ; he calls his @entity20 and @entity22 sites " my permanent radio station " for their promotional power			1
but they also provide him an invaluable way to connect with his fans			0
" i make sure that my fans realize that they can talk to me , " he says			0
i think sometimes celebrities get so big they 're not reachable			0
when you 're not in a place where people feel like they know you or can contact you or can talk to you , it 's harder for them to support you			0
people want to act like they know celebrities			0
they want to see pictures			0
they want to know where you 're going			0
they want to hear you talk about your family			0
they want to hear you b * * * * and complain about problems			0
they want to know that you 're human			0
people [ in the entertainment industry ] who do n't realize that are people who will be left behind			0
they 're not realizing the day and time we 're living in			0
