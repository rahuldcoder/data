@entity0 -- many of @entity0 's foreign residents will have to think twice before buying a new home in this @entity6 financial hub			1
in a surprise move last month to curb skyrocketing property prices , the @entity0 government announced the immediate implementation of a 15 % property tax on all home purchases -- by foreigners			1
the fallout has been fast			0
" i think it 's a harsh measure , " says @entity15 , an @entity16 who has called @entity0 home the past six years			1
little , a realtor with local agency @entity21 , says the anti-foreigner tax has priced some of his western clients out of the market			0
" some of them who 've been here for three to five years ... now they basically see @entity0 as not very welcoming , not really accommodating , to setting up permanently , " he says			2
@entity15 adds the tax fails to match @entity0 's image as a world - class city and that some of his clients are now thinking about leaving			1
but the @entity0 government sees the tax as a necessary policy to protect the city 's economy from an inflating property bubble -- fueled not just by foreign investment but also by low interest rates linked to protracted quantitative easing by the @entity42 and limited supply of new housing on the market			1
in just the first nine months of this year , average property prices in @entity0 jumped 20 %			1
since the start of 2010 , the price ballooned 50 %			0
this has made @entity0 's property sector a dream for established homeowners but a nightmare for potential buyers			1
" @entity0 is the most expensive of our cities in which to purchase property , " wrote @entity55 , a global real estate services provider , in its @entity57			2
the city is pricier than @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 , @entity55 found			0
@entity55 added @entity0 's property market " is in a league of its own			2
" @entity69 targeted while @entity0 's new tax affects a broad swath of @entity0 's foreign population , property experts say the real bull 's - eye is on the backs of a more specific group of buyers flush with new wealth from right across the border in @entity80			1
" i think it 's mainly focusing on mainland buyers , " says @entity81 , chief analyst for @entity82 , one of @entity0 's largest real estate companies			2
he says he does not totally agree with the new tax policy , but that it is something the government has to do			2
" over the past two years and three quarters , we roughly estimate about 9 % of the buyers ( of @entity0 property ) are from the mainland , " says @entity81			1
in absolute terms , it may not sound like much , but @entity81 asserts it is " a pretty big chunk compared to the annual supply of residential units in @entity0			2
" he says just 8,000 to 10,000 new residential units come online every year -- a supply bottleneck that keeps the city 's property prices climbing			0
with the tax in force , @entity81 forecasts a 2 % to 3 % drop in the number of mainland @entity80 investors in @entity0 property			1
this figure is expected to be 5 % in the next six months			0
" unfair " @entity111 , 27 , is one of the first mainland @entity80 in @entity0 to be hit by the new tax			1
two years ago , he moved to the city as a student , then parlayed his diploma into a financial relations job after graduation			0
@entity111 and his wife planned to buy his first @entity0 home in december and had already prepared a 20 % down payment			1
the new tax dashed their dreams , literally overnight			0
" it is unfair , emotionally it is unfair for me , " he said			0
" it 's a surprising policy because i think @entity0 is a very free market ( and ) they do n't want to curb any investments			2
" @entity111 stressed that he is different from other mainlanders , many of whom are believed to be speculators driving the city 's property bubble			0
" most of the speculators are from mainland @entity80 , " he says			1
" for me , i 'm also from mainland @entity80 , but i 'm [ part of ] the people who work here , have a stable salary , and i just want to buy affordable houses , instead of renting a place at a high price			1
" but he understands the new tax does not differentiate based on intent - only on immigrant status			0
interest rates , property supply looking ahead , @entity81 , the real estate analyst , predicts @entity0 's anti-foreigner property tax may stay in effect through 2015 when the city 's interest rates may rebound and when new property is expected to become available , according to government estimates			1
but he cautions against any expectations of a price crash saying " property prices will remain flat or soften a little bit " over the next six months			0
in the meantime , many would - be buyers will wait out the life of the tax , sitting on their money until the policy ends			2
@entity111 says he plans to stay in @entity0 for the long haul			0
" comparing with mainland @entity80 , it is still a better place , " @entity111 says			1
" it is still a free market for me			0
so i love it here , i still love it here			0
" @entity171 contributed to this report .			0
