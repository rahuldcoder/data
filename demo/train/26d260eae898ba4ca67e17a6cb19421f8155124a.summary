@entity0 , @entity1 -- it all began simply : a hand - scrawled sign on a lamp post that read , " want to volunteer ? meet at @entity6 at noon			1
" then there was the @entity9 page , which cobbled together 19 like - minded friends interested in helping victims of a unique weather system that meteorologists later dubbed @entity13			1
" our initial idea was that people would find each other on this page and solve each other 's problems , " said @entity14 , a @entity0 resident who helped organize the effort			1
" from 19 people it turned into 50 in about an hour - and - a - half , " she said			2
now , hundreds buzz in and out of a historic downtown mansion in @entity0 , where a neighboring church donated the building to be used as the group 's improvised headquarters			1
@entity32 now @entity13 born out of what many described as a scarcity of local information and services in the storm 's immediate aftermath , the @entity33 is now a hive of volunteer activity that federal agencies like @entity43 have looked to for partners			1
" we all came together and joined our efforts , " said @entity45 , a local resident who helped organize relief after @entity13 's october 29 landfall			1
coordinated virtually all by social media , the once fledgling effort has burgeoned into a full - scale relief operation that delivers more than 250 meals per day , as well as clothing and cleaning supplies to storm - battered residents			1
the group also cleans out flood - soaked apartments , while dispatching scout teams to check on the elderly and disabled			2
" it 's been pretty incredible , " said @entity61			2
finding joy among the wreckage : family photos returned @entity66 pulling an iphone from her pocket , she then thumbed across its cracked screen and opened a @entity9 app to give a sense of how the delivery process works			0
a request flashed on screen			0
holed up in his stormed - battered home , a @entity9 user had asked for dog food and towels " from the volunteer network you are coordinating , if that is possible			1
" " on it ! " @entity61 replied , dispatching volunteers to the man 's address , while tallying the appeal and recording her volunteers ' names in the group 's growing database			1
moments later , he wrote again			0
" i do n't know how to thank you			0
10 minutes after my request , i had what i need			0
" general @entity98 on @entity13 recovery with government agencies stretched thin to reach those still reeling in @entity13 's aftermath , a patchwork of volunteer efforts like those in @entity0 have cropped up in storm - affected communities across the tri-state area			1
forged quickly and often with little formal structure , neighborhood groups -- like the @entity33 volunteers -- often prove especially effective by way of their numbers , energy and local knowledge			2
and at times , they offer victims their only reprieve in disaster - stricken communities			1
" it 's just one those beautiful heartbreaks , " said nurse @entity121 , referring to how neighbors help each other in the wake of the crisis			2
map : images of destruction , recovery on the @entity132 bounding up stairs to deliver food in local apartment buildings , @entity133 shares that very sentiment			0
power outages hobbled elevators across @entity0 , stranding the elderly and disabled as utility companies scrambled to restore power , making volunteer deliveries of food , water and blankets critical in those first days			1
" our first delivery was on the 17th floor , " said the 31 - year - old real estate agent			0
nine floors down , a wheelchair - bound woman named @entity151 braved the cold in her powerless apartment for about a week " no heat			0
nothing , " she said			0
" if i had to go down ( the stairs ) , they 'd have to carry me down			0
and i was n't about to be carried			0
" risks of rebuilding after @entity13 the @entity33 volunteers sent a nurse the following day			1
though food supplies are a recurring concern			0
" when we run out ( of food ) , we go on @entity9 and say ' we have an immediate need , ' and within an hour we get food , " said volunteer @entity167			0
last week , the group received a star - powered dose of support when members of the @entity179 women 's @entity177 team swung by to pitch in and donate supplies			1
" until you 're actually here helping people find sweaters and pants ... you do n't realize how big of a deal it is , " said @entity181 , a gold medalist in the @entity182			0
@entity181 -- who has more than 190,000 followers on @entity191 -- then took to the micro-blogging site , asking people to send " canned food , bread and non perishable foods to 83 @entity197 " in @entity0 to support the relief effort			2
" hopefully if at least one of those followers came and donated that would do something , " she said			0
larger organizations like @entity43 and the @entity203 have also taken note			0
trying to keep the family business afloat after @entity13 " we are working closely with these volunteer agencies , " said @entity206 , a @entity43 spokesman who encouraged residents to register online for disaster assistance and contact their insurance providers			1
" but housing issues are going to be the problem in the long run , " he said			0
faced with a lack of physical space for @entity43 trailers and limited access to available rental apartments and hotels , the agency says it 's now bent on making flood - soaked homes inhabitable as the winter weather moves in			2
that " keep - ' em - in - their - homes " strategy likely means that the man - power behind volunteer efforts will continue to be needed as temperatures drop			1
yet as national interest wanes and volunteers return to their own jobs and families , the resolve of relief efforts in places like @entity0 will likely be tested			1
as of tuesday , more than 18,000 homes were still in the dark across the region			0
