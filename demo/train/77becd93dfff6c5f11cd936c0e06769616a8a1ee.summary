-- an overlooked female pinkie bone put in storage after it was discovered in a @entity6 cave two years ago points to the existence of a previously unknown prehistoric human species , anthropologists say			1
and the lineage of that species may survive today in some people in @entity13 and nearby islands , scientists say			0
a report on the discovery of the finger was published in the december 23 edition of the scientific journal nature			0
anthropologists say the 30,000 - to 50,000 - year - old finger is evidence of a new population of hominids they call @entity26			1
the name is derived from the southern @entity6 cave in which the finger bone was found			1
geneticists say the finger probably belonged to a 6 - or 7 - year - old girl			1
" the whole story is incredible			0
it 's like a surprising @entity41 present , " said @entity34 , a @entity35 paleontologist not involved in the research who was quoted in the online article			0
the 3 billion - letter nuclear genome derived from the child 's finger shows that the ice - age population of early humans was more diverse than previously thought			1
also , a comparison of the genome to modern humans indicates that @entity51 inhabitants of @entity13 and various @entity52 inherited as much as 5 percent of their dna from @entity26			2
the genome research was conducted at the @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57			0
the @entity26 , the scientists say , were more closely related to @entity59 than modern humans			2
the discovery in @entity6 suggests they may have lived across a wide swath of @entity63 and are likely to have intermingled with the ancestors of modern humans who migrated eastward from @entity66 .			0

a *small* bone found in a cave in @entity6 could indicate a new species of early humans
dna of " @entity26 " is found in modern @entity72
the finger belonged to 6 - or 7 - year - old girl , anthropologists say
