-- the atmosphere could have fallen a little flat after the @entity4 setback against @entity5 , but it did not stop a capacity 71,000 crowd at the @entity7 celebrating @entity10 's 24th @entity9 title in traditional style saturday			1
a last - gasp winner from @entity13 ensured the final league game of the season would result in a 1 - 0 win over @entity17 and the cue for the party to start			1
manager @entity20 was dowsed with the best @entity22 beer as has become the custom , with defenders @entity24 and @entity26 the main protagonists			1
he scarcely seemed to mind as he lifted the shield , reward for an all - conquering season which saw the championship wrapped up by march and with 29 wins , three draws and only two defeats			0
some have blamed the early clinching of the title for some lackluster performances which followed , including the 5 - 0 semifinal aggregate reverse to @entity5 which ended @entity10 's hopes of defending the @entity4 crown			0
the last league game was also a low - key affair on the pitch until @entity44 's @entity13 scored from outside the penalty area in the 92nd minute			2
@entity20 , whose future at @entity10 has been the subject of some speculation , looked a relieved man after it went in , but he will be hoping his team can raise themselves for one final big performance next week			1
they face arch - rivals @entity54 in the @entity57 final in @entity58 , hoping to complete the domestic double before many of their squad head to @entity63 for the @entity65 finals			1
@entity10 may have to do so without key midfielder @entity66 , who limped off in the first half with a knee injury			0
he will undergo an mri scan monday to determine the seriousness , worrying for his club side and @entity72			0
" @entity66 has a problem with his kneecap , " @entity20 told the official @entity10 website			2
" but we still have six days to go until the cup final			0
" @entity20 also reflected on his team 's achievements in his first season in charge			2
" the first championship is very special for a @entity83 such as myself , " he said .			0
