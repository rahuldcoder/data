a @entity4 grand jury has declined to indict a white police officer who shot and killed an ailing 68 - year - old black veteran in his own apartment , the @entity2 district attorney 's @entity0 said thursday			1
the shooting occurred in november after police responded to a call that @entity11 , who suffered from respiratory and heart problems , had set off his medical alert device , indicating he needed help			1
the encounter was recorded by audio and video devices which police released to the public yesterday to counter charges they had engaged in excessive force and racial profiling			1
district attorney @entity23 called the shooting " a tragedy on many levels " but said the grand jury had not chosen to indict after hearing from 42 witnesses , including police officer @entity30 , who fired the fatal shots			1
" there were civilian witnesses , there were police witnesses , there were expert witnesses , 100 exhibits went before that jury			2
and in this case most of this event was captured in audio of video tape , " @entity23 said			0
" all of that information was before the people who made the determination in this case			0
" following her announcement , the @entity49 @entity48 released much of this evidence , including portions of the audio and video tapes and 200 pages of documents			2
in the very early hours of november 19 , @entity58 had accidently set off a medical alert pendant he wore around his neck in case of emergency			1
the company that monitors the device alerted the city which dispatched an ambulance to the scene			2
police arrived first and are seen entering on a hallway security camera			2
an audio tape of a speakerphone inside @entity58 's apartment records the dispatcher asking @entity58 if he is okay			1
he repeatedly says he is fine and asks for police to go away			2
" this is your health center , @entity79 life aid			0
mr. @entity11 do you need help ? , " they ask him at one point			2
" yes , this is emergency , i have the @entity49 @entity48 knocking on my door and i did not call them and i am not sick , " he replies , then he is heard asking the police to please go away			1
in the written reports , officer @entity89 describes @entity58 as an irrational man who stuck an 8 - inch butcher knife through a crack in the door and jammed it shut with a chair when police tried to enter			1
police carried a @entity100 gun with a video camera on it that recorded about 20 minutes of their determination to get inside			0
a metal object is protruding through a crack in the door but it is unclear what it is			0
next , police can be seen forcing the door open and firing the taser at @entity58 who is wearing only shorts			1
he is standing there with only one arm visible at his side and yells " shoot me , shoot me , mother ( expletive ) , shoot me : " it is unclear whether the @entity100 fire strikes him			0
he is left standing there when the video cuts off			0
police say that after the @entity100 failed they shot bean bags at @entity58 , then forced their way in			1
@entity89 says @entity58 made " " continuous slashing motions towards my head and face " and that officer @entity30 only fired real bullets when @entity58 went after another officer " with the butcher knife raised			1
" photos of the crime scene show signs of forced entry , blood on the floor and an overturned chair			0
there is no video of the the shooting			0
" he feared for his life , " said @entity58 's son , also named @entity11			1
" he kept asking them to go away and that he did n't need their help			0
" he said his father was an old man who was sick and said police were not justified in forcing their way in when he had committed no crime			0
shooting draws parallels to @entity159 case " they were supposed to be there to help him because of a medical alert , " he said			1
@entity58 's niece , @entity165 , was outside the door with police , asking them to let her talk to her uncle instead of forcing their way in , she said			1
" i heard my uncle begging and pleading them to please leave him alone , " @entity165 said			0
" i could begin to almost hear fear in his voice			0
" @entity58 , a @entity176 , had such severe respiratory problems he could not walk a flight of stairs , according to his medical records			1
an autopsy released yesterday showed he had a blood alcohol level of 0.11 -- high enough to be considered legally drunk			0
@entity165 , who lives in the building , said her uncle told them he was fine when they arrived but did not want to open the door			0
she said she insisted to police that they let him talk to his family , but they refused			2
@entity190 , @entity49 public safety commissioner , told reporters : " we are obligated as a police department never to walk away from an emergency and we 're not going to			1
" he added that his department would be reviewing the entire case and how they deal with emotionally disturbed people in the future			0
the city has said it will also conduct an independent review			0
in wake of the case of @entity159 , the unarmed , black 17 - year - old who was shot and killed in @entity204 , @entity205 , by a neighborhood watch volunteer , the @entity58 case gained national attention with more than 206,000 signing an online petition asking for the district attorney to charge the officers involved in the shooting with murder and civil rights violations			2
the family said they believed @entity58 was treated differently because he lives in a housing project and is black			1
they said could hear one of the police officers on the audio tape referring to @entity58 by using the n - word			2
that was not part of the evidence released yesterday , but the district attorney confirmed it was on the tape and said : " the use of a racial epithet in any context is offensive to the dignity of all of us			0
