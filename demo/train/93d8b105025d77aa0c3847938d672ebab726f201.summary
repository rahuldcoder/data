@entity0 , @entity1 -- vast and inhospitable , the @entity3 in south west @entity4 is a land of ghosts			1
along a notorious stretch of shoreline known as the @entity9 lie the wrecks of ships stranded in the morning seafogs			0
venture inland and you 'll encounter even more spectral scenes : one of @entity4 's most famous ghost towns -- and even " ghost horses			1
" considered the world 's oldest desert , the @entity3 has been dry for an estimated 55 million years			1
stretching for hundreds of kilometers along @entity1 's @entity22 coastline , its infamously hostile terrain has made @entity1 one of the world 's most sparsely populated countries			1
yet amid this unforgiving landscape is evidence of once thriving human settlement			0
@entity0 -- afrikaans for " @entity30 " -- was once a diamond - mining boom town , complete with a grand ballroom , casino and skittle alley			1
today it is an eerie ghost settlement , its sand - logged buildings slowly being reclaimed by the dunes			1
named after @entity40 , a man who abandoned his ox wagon there during a sandstorm , the area was the center of a diamond boom a century ago			2
in 1908 , an @entity47 railway worker named @entity48 was shoveling sand from the tracks when he struck a glittering diamond			2
the ensuing rush brought a wave of @entity55 fortune hunters to the region , then part of a colony known as @entity4			2
with their newfound wealth , the settlers set about building a @entity4 - style village amid the dunes , complete with amenities such as a hospital with a rare x-ray machine , and a tram			2

" during its heyday in the 1920s , @entity0 's population consisted of about 300 @entity55 adults and 40 of their children , supported by 800 local workers			1

when the hospital closed its doors in 1956 , the last remaining settlers left shortly afterward			0
today , as a monument to the settlement 's distinctive history , @entity0 is a popular tourist destination , although a permit is required to enter			1
this is because the site sits within the @entity95 -- a " prohibited zone " declared by @entity4 authorities on the discovery of the diamond deposits			0
although @entity4 was occupied by @entity47 in 1915 , and @entity1 emerged as an independent state in 1990 , diamond mining remains a lucrative concern and the area remains a restricted region under the control of @entity105			1
@entity106 is a geologist for @entity105 , a joint venture between the @entity1 government and diamond mining company @entity108			1
he said the early miners " took the easy ones , the ones on top			0
" " they would glisten in the dunes in the light of the moon , " he said			0
" now we have to blast them out of the ground because the ground has cement in it			0
so it 's harder and expensive , but there 's still a lot out there ... there 's 400 million ( carats ) sitting somewhere			0
" but @entity0 is not the only ghost of the @entity3			1
just as iconic a symbol of the area is the hardy population of 150 or so wild horses , who have adapted to be able to go without water for longer periods than domestic horses , surviving for generations on the desert 's fringe			1
read also : @entity142 's treasure at risk from uprising horses are not native to southern @entity4 , and the horses ' origins have long been shrouded in mystery			2
according to @entity150 , manager of the nearby @entity152 lodge , the most likely theory is that they were @entity4 and @entity47 military horses abandoned in the chaos of the @entity155			0
" there was a water point close by , " he said			0
" that 's why the horses survived all these years			2
" it is also thought the restricted human access to the region helped their survival , sparing the the feral animals from being caught or hunted			1
for generations , the horses existed largely out of sight of locals			1
" they were known as the ghost horses , " said @entity150			2
" we hardly saw them			0
" but in recent decades their habitat has been reclassified as part of the @entity176 , @entity4 's largest game reserve , bringing them into greater contact with humans			0
this has raised the question of if and how humans should support the horses to keep their numbers at a sustainable level			0
experts have settled on a policy of limiting intervention , but providing some support , especially in times of hardship -- which has helped to bring people a little closer to these ghosts of the desert			0
" the behavior of the horses changed because they got used to people , " said @entity150			0
" they do n't fear man because man feeds them in dry times			0

today a ghost town , @entity1 's @entity0 was once a booming diamond village
during its peak in the 1920s , it was home to about *340* @entity55 and 800 locals
access to stretches of the @entity3 , the world 's oldest desert , has been restricted for mining
a population of feral horses has bred there for generations , becoming an icon of the @entity3
