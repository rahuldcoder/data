-- hip - hop has never produced anything quite like @entity3 -- a guy with a @entity6 ego and a @entity8 soul			2
the @entity10 singer - rapper introduced his melancholy - player persona on 2010 's platinum " @entity13 , " spooling out alarmingly mellow confessional brags over synth - streaked tracks that suggested someone had spiked his @entity17 with @entity18 and truth serum			1
" famous like a drug that i 've taken too much of , " he rapped , and somehow made you sympathetic to all his stardom - is - hard meditations			0
so , how 's he feeling these days ? the cover of " @entity25 " says it all : @entity3 sits forlornly in the depths of a mansion he could 've bought from 1970s @entity29 , slung over a golden goblet of $ 50 - a - glass painkiller			1
dude probably had sex two minutes ago , but he looks like his dog just got run over by a garbage truck			0
the music is grandiose , full of big names and weighty references -- from the drunk - dial epic " @entity40 " to the @entity42 hip - hop tribute " practice " to cameos from @entity45 © 3000 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			0
where " @entity13 " was airy and spare , " @entity25 " truly goes for it with luxe , expansive production : on " cameras , " beatmaking prodigy @entity53 provides diamond - bright high - hat clicks , low - end vroom and soulful background vocals as @entity3 struggles to convince his girl he 's not cheating on her after she sees him in a magazine with another woman ; on " @entity25 , " @entity61 laces a shake - the - sky mix of gospel choir , gauzy @entity65 sample and stomping beat , and @entity67 swoops in for a hilarious freestyle : " @entity69 on the water with the wonderful views / only fat ni * * a in the sauna with @entity74			1
" there 's even a funky thank - you letter to @entity3 's mom			2
@entity3 's ' @entity25 ' : a @entity78 mostly , @entity3 stretches out over languid , austerely plush tracks that blur hip - hop , r&b and downtempo dance music			1
" @entity89 " opens the album with a dreamweave of cascading pianos and plaintive backing vocals from @entity10 singer @entity88 : " i was drinking at the @entity90 last night / and ended up losing everything that i came with , " he raps in his finest just - woke - up voice			1
it 's what @entity3 does best , collapsing many moods -- arrogance , sadness , tenderness and self - pity -- into one vast , squish - souled emotion			1
on the elegant title track , @entity102 of @entity104 band the xx lays down house - music pianos , ice sheets of guitar and a sample from recently deceased @entity65 radical @entity110 as @entity3 and @entity111 do their laid - back , realist appraisal of the love game : " when you 're ready , just say you 're ready , " he reassures			0
is it going to work out ? maybe			0
but like most hopeless romantics , @entity3 favors the illusion of infinite promise over the reality anyway			1
the @entity121 : @entity3 , ' thank me later ' " we live in a generation of not being in love , " he says over @entity48 's harmonica on " @entity25			2
" it 's as close as " @entity25 " gets to a message for our times			0
but deep down you wonder if he 'd have it any other way			0
after all , in a fully requited world , who 'd need @entity3 ? copyright © 2011 @entity0 .			0

" @entity25 " is what @entity3 does best : collapsing many moods onto one vast emotion
like most hopeless romantics , he favors the illusion of infinite promise over the reality
