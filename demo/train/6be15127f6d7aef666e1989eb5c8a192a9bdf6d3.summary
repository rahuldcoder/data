it may be one of the most - quoted lines in @entity3 literature -- and if you dare to quote it , you might have to pay			1
in late october , @entity6 -- which represents @entity9 - winning author @entity8 's estate -- sued representatives of @entity12 's " @entity11 " for misquoting the famous line , " the past is never dead			1
it 's not even past			2
" in the film , about a writer who travels back in time to 1920s @entity20 , @entity17 's character lightly rephrases the line as " the past is not dead			1
actually , it 's not even past			2
" for the film 's sin , @entity8 's estate is suing for copyright infringement and asking for " damages , disgorgement of profits , costs and attorney fees , " according to the suit			1
defendant @entity34 , which released " midnight in @entity20 , " quickly fired back			0
last living @entity8 talks about ' @entity35 ' " this is a frivolous lawsuit and we are confident we will prevail in defending it , " the studio said in a statement , according to @entity38			1
@entity34 is defending the quotation as a " fair use " under copyright law , which is a defense that lets others freely reproduce copyrighted works for purposes such as criticism , comment and news reporting			1
@entity12 had no comment , his publicist told @entity54			1
but @entity55 , executor of the @entity8 estate , believes the movie went over the line in its use of the quotation , which comes from @entity8 's 1950 work " @entity61			1
" he points out that " @entity11 " is a commercial enterprise , the line was important to the film and @entity12 or @entity34 should have asked permission			1
@entity66 asked and received permission ( for a fee ) from the estate to use a @entity8 quotation in a @entity66 - produced tv series , he says , and @entity34 or @entity12 could have easily done the same			1
" i do n't think @entity12 is any less knowledgeable than @entity66 , " says @entity55 , a lawyer and movie producer			1
" i think @entity12 's in the motion - picture business			1
it 's called a business because you make a movie that sells tickets			2
... when you attach @entity8 to your product , you 're enhancing that product			1
you 're enhancing it for artistic reasons , but you 're mostly enhancing it for the entertaining business reasons of why you make a product more appealing			2
" moreover , he adds , " if @entity12 could have written something better , i 'm sure he would have			1
" but @entity88 , an entertainment lawyer who specializes in copyright and fair use , thinks the @entity8 estate is grasping			1
the quote is short , for one thing -- nine words , a tiny fraction of " @entity61			0
" " you 're telling me one sentence gets you a copyright infringement action ? i do n't think so , " he says			2
@entity55 disagreed with that line of thinking			2
" it puzzles me that people think size matters , " he says			0
in addition , copyright infringement comes into play if it can damage the " potential market " of the original work			0
" i guess the book will never sell another copy , do n't you think ? " @entity88 thundered mockingly			0
" it 's all over for @entity8 ! " looking backward with the bard of @entity113 of all the writers to be involved in a copyright infringement lawsuit , @entity8 would seem one of the least likely			1
the bard of @entity113 , @entity117 , is known for colorfully evocative novels about a murky @entity120 landscape , which -- though rewarding -- are often the kinds of books forced on unsuspecting high school students			0
his writing is n't exactly pithy : he 's been listed in @entity125 for constructing a record - setting 1,288 - word sentence ( in " @entity127 " )			1
some of his best known works , such as " @entity129 " and " @entity130 , " are noted for their thickets of stream - of - consciousness storytelling			1
for many years , the @entity134 honored scribblers who attempted to reproduce the master 's rhythmic prose , tormented @entity120 characters , and endless comma - strung clauses ( with parenthetical asides )			1
@entity8 was no stranger to @entity142 himself , signing a series of contracts in the ' 30s and ' 40s to write for various studios			1
he was credited with six screenplays , including the adaptations of @entity150 's " to have and have not " and @entity151 's " @entity149			0
" his love - hate relationship with the movies was parodied in the @entity155 ' film " @entity163 " through the character of @entity157 , a hard - drinking @entity158 hailed by the title character as " the finest novelist of our time			0
" touring the @entity158 's literary landmarks indeed , @entity8 is considered a titan of @entity3 literature , often evoked with @entity150 and @entity168 @entity167 among a trio of @entity171 greats			1
his words -- particularly the ones approximated in " @entity11 " -- still echo , says @entity174 , the @entity174 chair of @entity175 at ( where else ? ) the @entity176			2
" it describes themes in @entity3 history , and i think that 's one of the reasons why that line has had such resonance , " he says			1
@entity8 's line is haunting and backward - looking , a warning that we forget our tangled roots at our peril -- a sentiment not often expressed in this country , he points out			1
" as a culture , the @entity3 is pretty forward - looking and youth - oriented , " @entity174 says , " and we very often tend to have a sharper eye on our future than on the past			1
" a ' very gray area ' in a way , it 's looking backward that 's the nub of the lawsuit			2
artists routinely stand on the shoulders of their predecessors , channeling ideas through their personal lenses			0
done creatively , it can provide whole new meanings to the original source			0
@entity208 used @entity212 's " @entity211 " as the basis for " @entity210 " ; @entity212 , in turn , relied on @entity215 's " inferno			0
" @entity8 's books , too , are full of references to other works , particularly the @entity219 and shakespeare 's plays ( which are both in the public domain )			1
" he even said , at moments when he was asked to give advice to young writers , that there 's an element of artistic creation that is glorified stealing , " says @entity174			2
" in order to be bold and ambitious as an artist , you have to be willing to use whatever you find wherever you may find it			0
" other artists have made frequent use of @entity8			2
the @entity234 at @entity235 maintains a page of " @entity8 sightings			2
" of course , when done less than creatively , it provides openings for the attorneys -- and in our remix - happy society , full of self - produced videos and sampled music , there 's a fine line between creativity and copyright infringement ( or , for that matter , outright piracy )			1
@entity252 alone is full of ripped - off video files and audio tracks , says @entity88			0
" it 's a morass out there of violations across the board , " he says			0
but it is sometimes hard to determine when the line is crossed			0
artists and their estates have sued in the past when they believed their copyrights were being infringed upon			0
in 2001 , @entity266 's estate sued author @entity267 and publisher @entity268 over @entity270 's " @entity269 , " a parody of " @entity275 " told from the point of view of a slave			2
that case was eventually settled out of court , though an appeals court had upheld @entity270 's right to create the book			0
fair use is a " very gray area , " says @entity283 , who runs the @entity284 at @entity286 's @entity285			0
" there are lots of things that are not clear			0
" " i get things where people are like , ' are you sure i can do this ? ' and the best i can say is , ' yes , you should be able to , ' " she says			0
however , she does n't see a problem with " @entity11 " and " the past is not dead			2
" besides , the phrase has been used many times before -- in news headlines , tv shows and song lyrics			0
president @entity302 even used the line in perhaps the most famous speech of the 2008 campaign , known as " @entity306 , " which he delivered in response to the controversy involving his former pastor , the rev. @entity309			0
@entity302 's speech chronicled the challenges of race in @entity3 , and also misquoted @entity8 : " the past is n't dead and buried			1
in fact , it is n't even past , " @entity302 said			0
" the idea that one person can control the use of those particular words seems ridiculous to me , " says @entity283			0
" any of kind of literary allusion is ordinarily celebrated			0
this seems to squarely fall in that tradition			0
" it seems like a lot of effort over a few words -- this case of the estate of a long - dead author going up against a multibillion - dollar @entity142 conglomerate			2
but the impact can be deep			0
@entity283 is worried about a chilling effect ; @entity55 is hoping that a brighter line can be introduced in the dim area of fair use			0
it 's nothing personal , he adds			0
he loved " midnight in @entity20			0
" as executor , he 's just looking out for the fiduciary responsibilities of the @entity8 estate , and he 's willing to let a jury decide the merits of the copyright case			1
" i 'd love to have @entity12 come down and have a free tour of ( @entity8 's house ) @entity346 , " he says			1
" but if he wants to use any more of mr. @entity8 , i would want him to give me a call and discuss a license fee			2

@entity8 quotation subject of a lawsuit
@entity12 used much - quoted line in " @entity11 " ; @entity8 estate suing
studio believes line is *protected* by legal doctrine ; if they 're wrong , could affect other works
