-- today we are issuing a cease and desist to all you gurus , ninjas and evangelists out there			1
and we do n't mean the real ones			1
as you fire up your laptops and fuse your various essential electronic devices to your very flesh so as to never miss a fiber of the www , you will be forced to define yourself ; to look within your black soul and come up with a paltry handful of words that converge to denote " you			2
" well , at this juncture , we humbly request that those words not be " rock star			2
" in recent years , we have noticed an outright epidemic of cliched , narcissistic and , let 's be honest , straight - up embarrassing self - monikerization			2
in short : a ton of people have started calling themselves " visionaries " on their websites , @entity24 profiles , @entity26 profiles , etc. -- and it 's more than a little annoying			1
@entity31 , president and creative director of @entity33 , blames this pompous proliferation on the fact that our identities are now more public than ever			1
" given that one 's actual name ( e.g. , @entity38 ) does n't communicate semantic meaning , that 's what these types of titles are all about -- working to control that first impression , " she says			1
well , no one wants their first impression to be " tool			2
" so ... some advice : do n't be a cliche does your title -- " executive engineer of cross-functional branding , " or whatever -- seem a little boring ? well , slapping " ninja " in front of it may seem like a quick fix -- if it were n't for the fact that there are tons of other people out there who had the same genius idea as you			1
last year , @entity24 tabulated how many ninjas were sneaking around the job - finding site and found it to be an extremely trendy title			1
to quote " @entity73 " -- which is also cliched , sorry -- " you are not a beautiful or unique snowflake , " you @entity76 , you			2
you are merely one of huddled masses of gray - suited commuters suffering from @entity80 - induced delusions of grandeur			2
if you do , in fact , feel impelled to flesh out your title with something descriptive , at least mull it over for a moment and come up with something original , like " @entity88 , " of which there is only one on @entity24			1
do n't be confusing still , there is a downside to getting all @entity93 with your title , like the whisperer up there			1
we 're guessing that the person in question is a bartender of some sort -- a fact that 's not wholly explicit given the title of choice			0
frankly , we just picture some sloshed dude conversing , sadly , with his olives			0
according to @entity104 , spokeswoman for @entity24 , calling yourself a rock star or something of that nature online could have a downside when it comes to reaching potential employers			1
" you always want to make sure that you 're referencing words and phrases that people actually search for in order to make sure your profile appears in those results , " she says			1
let 's say a potential employer is getting some internet assistance in hiring a photographer			0
well , what do you think said potential employer is going to enter into the @entity125 search field ? if you guessed , " visual media rock star , " well , then you would be wrong			0
" when you 're crafting your profile , think of the words and phrases you want to be associated with , " @entity104 says			0
speaking of real rock stars , here 's a relevant example of exacting nomenclature from the indie music world			0
this week , the band @entity135 sent out an e-mail declaring that it had finally secured the @entity26 handle @ @entity135			0
before , the band 's handle had been @ @entity139 , which was the title of its last album			0
according to the band manager , @entity143 , another user had been sitting on the @ @entity135 handle for a while , and the band finally managed to wrest it out of that person 's ( we hope not cold , dead ) hands			0
" we did jump up like a thousand fans in one day , " @entity143 says of the switch			0
why ? because the band is now more accurately representing itself -- it 's easier to find			0
so , yeah , unless you 're toting a guitar case and cramming yourself into a sweaty tour bus every other month , we suggest leaving the term " rock star " out of your job title -- and even then , the whole " star " classification seems a little self - aggrandizing			0
which leads us to our next point ... do n't be pompous if you 're calling yourself a " universe shifter , " it pretty much signals to said cosmos that you are not , in fact , anything of the kind			1
as @entity31 says , " certain titles , like ' evangelist ' and ' @entity176 ' are just taking it a little too far			0
if you truly are a visionary , it will most likely show through in other ways			2
if @entity180 had a @entity24 profile , i doubt he 'd call himself ' pre-eminent ideological leader			1
' " so when setting out to " find yourself " in the sucking quagmire that is the @entity185 , we suggest getting more creative with the manner in which you define yourself			2
nix the slovenly shorthand and do the whole " show , do n't tell " thing they teach you about in high school creative writing classes : craft a homepage that shows your personality and demonstrates your skills ( services like @entity198 and @entity199 make that idiot - proof ) , for example			1
unless , you know , you are a ninja			0
in which case , carry on .			0

a ton of people have started calling themselves " visionaries " on their websites
@entity24 has *documented* the rise of people calling themselves " ninjas " on the *networking* site
do n't do that ; instead , get creative and try a " show , do n't tell " *approach*
craft a homepage that shows your personality and demonstrates your skills
