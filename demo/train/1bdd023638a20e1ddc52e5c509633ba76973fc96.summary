" president @entity9 , who went on sick leave last thursday for " acute respiratory disease , " is seeking a way out of a deepening political crisis that has paralyzed @entity13 , the capital			1

last week , in the first concessions made by the government , the prime minister and @entity22 resigned , a controversial anti-protest law was repealed , and @entity9 signed off on a contested amnesty bill for anti-government protesters			1
but opposition leaders , who have received backing from the @entity32 and @entity33 governments , are pressing for more concessions			2
in a statement monday , @entity4 's @entity35 told protesters who have set up tents and barricades in the central @entity15 to halt their " provocative steps			1
