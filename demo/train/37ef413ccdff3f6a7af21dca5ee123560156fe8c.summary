-- @entity3 has been fired as head football coach at the @entity5 , the school 's athletics director said tuesday			1
@entity3 's lack of candor about his " personal and professional relationship " with a female employee who was riding with him on a motorcycle that crashed earlier this month was key to the decision , @entity6 told reporters			1
" coach @entity3 knowingly misled the athletics department and the university about the circumstances related to his accident , " @entity6 said in a news conference at the university 's baskeball arena in @entity17			1
though the 51 - year - old coach had " multiple opportunities " over four days after the accident to be forthcoming , " he chose not to			2
" @entity3 had been placed on paid administrative leave last week after it was revealed he had not disclosed that @entity27 , a 25 - year - old female member of his staff , was on his motorcycle with him when it crashed on april 1 and that he had given her unfairly favorable treatment in hiring her on his staff			1
@entity6 said @entity3 had been fired with cause , meaning the university is not obligated to pay out his contract			1
university chancellor @entity36 issued a statement tuesday saying the coach 's contract " establishes a process by which he may have his termination decision reviewed			1
under that process , the review would ultimately come to me for consideration and action			2
" given my role in the review process as chancellor , i must decline further comment on today 's announcement			2
" @entity3 issued a statement tuesday night saying he takes responsibility for what happened and apologizing for , among other things , putting long " in the position of having to sort through my mistakes			1
" " the simplest response i have is : i 'm sorry , " @entity3 said in the statement			1
" these two words seem very inadequate			0
but that is my heart			0
all i have been able to think about is the number of people i 've let down by making selfish decisions			0
i 've taken a lot of criticism in the past			0
some deserved , some not deserved			0
this time , i have no one to blame but myself			0
" @entity3 also said , " i have hurt my wife , @entity71 , and our four children			1
i 've let down the @entity5 , my team , coaching staff and everyone associated with the @entity77 football program			0
" he also said his " sole focus at this point is trying to repair the damage i 've done to my family			0
they did not ask for any of this and deserve better			0
i am committed to being a better husband , father and human being as a result of this and will work each and every day to prove that to my family , friends and others			0
" @entity6 said his review of the case " raised several concerns which led me to look beyond the accident itself , " @entity6 said , citing " the process and circumstances that influenced his decision to hire ( @entity103 ) as a direct - report member of his staff , and his candor and behavior as a member of my staff			2
" @entity6 said @entity3 had had a " consensual relationship " with @entity103 , and that @entity3 had given @entity103 " some $ 20,000 " and failed to disclose their relationship when recommending her for the job with the department , thereby giving her " an unfair and undisclosed advantage for a position on his football staff			1
" @entity103 , @entity6 said , was one of 159 applicants for the job			0
" by itself , coach @entity3 's consensual relationship with miss @entity27 prior to her joining the football staff was not against university policy , " @entity6 said			1
" by itself , it 's a matter between individuals and their families			2
" however , in this case , coach @entity3 abused his authority when over the past few weeks he made a staff decision and personal choices that benefited himself " and compromised the university , @entity6 said			1
he said @entity3 also " engaged in a pattern of misleading and manipulative behavior designed to deceive me and members of the athletics staff both before and after the accident , " @entity6 said			1
@entity3 told the police investigating the crash that the sun and wind had caused him to lose control and crash into a pile of dirt and tree limbs on the side of the road , according to the police report			1
" he made a choice to return to practice ( last ) tuesday , to hold a press conference and to demonstrate his physical resiliency and command of his program , all the time failing to correct the initial report that he was the only person involved in the accident			0
he made a conscious decision to speak and mislead the public on tuesday			0
" in four seasons as head coach , @entity3 led the @entity77 to a 34 - 17 record , including an 11 - 2 record last season that included a victory in the @entity167			2
@entity168 finished the season ranked among the top five college teams in the nation			0
