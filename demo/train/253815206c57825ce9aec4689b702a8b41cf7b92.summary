-- the feat has not been achieved since 1936 but with every victory , the pressure on @entity3 to deliver a first @entity5 winner of the men 's singles at @entity7 since @entity8 grows			1
the expectation is always there for any leading @entity5 player but with @entity13 and @entity14 having unexpectedly dropped out of his section of the draw , @entity3 is fancied like never before to finally rewrite history			1
the beaten finalist in 2012 , the 26 - year - old survived a second set scare to beat @entity22 20th seed @entity21 6 - 4 7 - 5 ( 7 - 5 ) 6 - 1 and reach the quarterfinals for the sixth straight year			1
the second seed will meet the unseeded @entity25 for a place in the semifinals , with the @entity28 boasting an 8 - 1 winning record against the @entity30 , who beat @entity31 in straight sets			1
" it was a tough match , " @entity33 and @entity34 champion @entity3 said later			1
" the first couple of sets especially -- and he also had a chance at the start of the third			0
" but once i got ahead in the third set , i concentrated really hard not to let him back into the match like i did in the second set			2
" the turning point of a contest that lasted two hours and 37 minutes came in the second set when @entity3 managed to turn around a 2 - 5 deficit to win on a tie break			1
@entity21 needed treatment on a shoulder injury early in the third set and faded soon after , so allowing the @entity5 number one to reach the last eight without dropping a set			1
" i just have to concentrate on the next match , " he said when asked about the pressure of being the home favorite			0
" @entity56 lost today and she does n't lose particularly often , " he explained			0
" @entity14 lost , @entity13 lost -- all these guys and girls are better than me and if they can lose , so can @entity59 " should @entity3 come through his quarterfinal , he will meet either @entity61 or @entity62 in the last four -- with one of the @entity65 duo set to create history			1
whoever wins their clash will become the first pole to reach the semifinals of a men 's grand slam			1
the @entity74 sisters may have put @entity65 tennis on the map in recent years but they have long been hoping that they will be joined by their male compatriots			1
without a quarterfinalist at @entity7 since 1980 , two came along on the same day as 24th seed @entity61 , 22 , beat @entity81 's @entity80 in five sets while the @entity83 was also taken all the way when beating @entity85			2
despite the significance of their forthcoming encounter , @entity61 and @entity62 , 31 , hugged one another as soon as they met in the locker room after their respective wins			0
" it 's unbelievable what is going on right now , " the big - serving @entity61 told reporters			2
" we have two players in the quarterfinals in the men 's draw			2
" right now , tennis is a really famous sport in our country			0
i hope we 'll get more fans			0
" @entity62 's passage to the quarterfinals was first eased by the shock defeat of @entity13 in the opening round and then further helped as the @entity30 's conqueror @entity109 was forced to pull out of his second round meeting with the @entity111 through injury			2
in the top half of the draw , @entity115 -- who lost his first grand slam final against compatriot @entity13 at the @entity118 last month -- reached his second straight @entity7 quarterfinal when beating @entity121 's @entity120 6 - 7 7 - 6 6 - 1 6 - 1			1
" i 'm trying to play more aggressive , " said @entity115 , who has never progressed to the last four at @entity7			2
" i need to serve better than other courts , obviously when i am playing the second shot			0
every match i am playing better with my game			0
" next up for the consistent @entity30 , who will rise to a career - high world no. 3 in next week 's rankings , is @entity129 's @entity128 , who beat 23rd seed @entity130 in straight sets			1
" he 's a very great player , " said @entity115			0
" it 's going to be difficult			0
i need to play my best tennis to beat @entity128			0
and on a grass court i think it is more difficult			0
he plays better than me on grass			0
last year i beat him , but i think i played my best match on a grass court			0
" whoever wins through will meet either @entity142 , who beat @entity143 in straight sets late on monday , or @entity145 , who sunk @entity146 7 - 6 6 - 7 6 - 4 6 - 4 , in the last four .			1
