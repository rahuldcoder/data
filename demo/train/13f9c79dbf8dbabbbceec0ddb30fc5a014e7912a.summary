@entity0 , @entity1 -- two weeks ago , a growth was found on the chest of @entity6 's 6 - year - old dog , @entity7			1
given @entity7 's history with cancer -- he had one of his hind legs amputated in march to get rid of a tumor -- the veterinarian recommended immediate surgery			2
the timing could n't have been worse			0
@entity6 had just been laid off from her job , and now she and her husband were looking at an $ 850 bill			0
she was also six months pregnant			0
" it 's like , ' what are we going to do ? now ? really ? of all times ? ' " @entity6 said			2
" it 's really tough to meet our bills and to have this large amount of cost for @entity7 coming up , it was just really unexpected			2
" the @entity29 had been able to pay for @entity7 's amputation by raising money through family and friends			1
but now , they did n't know what to do			0
that 's when the vet told them about @entity39 , a nonprofit that helps dog owners pay for their pets ' needs during times of economic hardship			1
" we filled out the online application , and i got a phone call that night saying that they would love to help , " @entity6 said			0
since it started in 2009 , @entity50 has provided aid for nearly 400 dogs in @entity1 : $ 150,000 worth of dog food and medical care			1
" it 's to prevent dogs from being surrendered to shelters or euthanized when their owners can not afford care , " said @entity55 , who founded @entity50			1
" financial hardship is a very common reason why people surrender their animals to a shelter			1
and once they do that , it 's not a choice that you can undo			2
" between 2 million and 2.5 million dogs enter @entity73 shelters each year , and between 1 million and 2 million of those are euthanized , according to estimates from the @entity76			1
the @entity76 also says that as many as 1 million pets in @entity73 are at risk of becoming homeless because of the recent economic downturn			2
" i 've never had to choose between caring for my dogs or caring for myself , " said @entity55 , 39			1
" most of the people we help , they 're doing their best to get back on track			1
and then a crisis happens with their dog			2
and it 's just one more thing that they ca n't afford			2
... " it 's emotionally taxing on them because they think , ' if i ca n't even take care of this dog , what right do i have to have it ? ' so we want to take that burden away and say : ' you do have a right to have it			1
get through this , and we 'll help you			0
' and through that , we give them a little ray of hope			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity107 @entity55 knows how much an ailing dog can cost			1
she and her husband adopted their first dog , @entity112 , from a shelter in 2005 , when @entity112 was 10 years old			1
in the four years she spent with the couple , the pooch developed a host of health issues , including vertigo , dementia and ultimately cancer			0
over time , the costs for @entity112 's medicine , vet bills and special food averaged about $ 300 to $ 400 a month , @entity55 said			1
" having gone through a job loss myself , i thought : ' i 'm really glad that we had ladybug when we did , because we were able to afford it			0
if it had happened at a different point in time , i do n't know what we would 've done			0
we could n't have given up on her			0
she 'd never give up on us			0
' " after @entity112 died , @entity55 still had hundreds of dollars ' worth of pet medications and prescription food			1
with the veterinarian 's help , she donated them to another dog owner in need			1
but she was left wanting to do more			0
when @entity55 went to retrieve @entity112 's ashes from the veterinarian 's office , she asked the staff whether they knew of a way to sponsor the dog of a family less fortunate			1
they did not , but they directed her to a local newspaper article that discussed the growing need			0
" ( on ) the cover of the local paper was a story about dogs being tied to the front of shelters because people could n't afford to keep them anymore			1
they could n't afford to feed them , never mind get them medicine , " @entity55 recalled			1
" with @entity112 , her remains by my side ... within seconds , i melted into a puddle and could n't stop crying			0
i said , ' i have to do something			0
' " when @entity55 founded @entity50 , her goal was to help three families in her first year			1
she exceeded that expectation by 24			0
" i had such a hole in my heart ; i had to fill it , " @entity55 said			1
" and i could n't fill it by running out and getting another dog			2
i chose to find a way to sponsor other people who could not afford to keep their dog			1
" because ( @entity112 ) came from a shelter , it had two meanings for me			2
one was to keep her memory alive			0
and the other was to keep another dog from going to a shelter since that system is already stressed enough as it is			1
" dog owners can apply online for financial help , which is all funded by private donations			1
the nonprofit is able to subsidize up to $ 800 a year for a dog 's acute or chronic care and $ 300 a year for general wellness needs			1
for dogs who have needs exceeding those limits , the group has also hosted online fundraisers			2
" the money is given directly to the vet or pharmacy , " @entity55 said			2
" and the dog owner is responsible for at least 15 % of the cost			2
" dogs must also be spayed or neutered to receive help			0
the average applicant makes a maximum of $ 2,000 a month before taxes			0
the group prioritizes the elderly , people with disabilities and people whose unemployment benefits have expired			0
" a lot of the people that we sponsor ... have already lost so much that the one thing they try to hang on to is their dog , " @entity55 said			1
" a lot of them have lost their jobs			0
they 've lost their homes			0
some have even lost their significant other or their loved ones			0
and the dog , to them , is some sort of normal or a tie to a happier time			0
and they do n't want to have to make that devastating decision			0
" oftentimes , families who turn to @entity55 's group are facing life - and - death scenarios related to their dogs			1
@entity55 says 75 % of the grants her group has awarded have paid for emergency treatment that spared the dogs from being euthanized			1
" we 're just completely surprised that they were just able to help us out with the full ( sponsorship ) amount , " @entity6 said of the assistance her family received			0
" it was just such a blessing , and we 'll be forever grateful that @entity7 gets this second chance			0
" for @entity55 , who also has a full - time job at a market research firm , being able to provide those second chances is a tribute to @entity112 's memory			1
" every picture you see of a dog we 've helped , every story that we tell , it 's a happy ending			2
this dog is with its family and never had to go into a shelter , " @entity55 said , beaming			1
" it 's living happily ever after at home			0
and that 's why we 're called the @entity50 , because much like ( in ) @entity274 , we 're in the background			2
the dog does n't even know we exist , and we 're just making sure it gets to the ball			2
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity50 website at www.fairydogparents.org and see how to help .			0

economic *struggles* have made it hard for many people to pay for their dogs ' needs
when that happens , the dog may be given to a shelter or euthanized if they 're sick
@entity55 's nonprofit provides financial aid to families so they can keep their dogs
