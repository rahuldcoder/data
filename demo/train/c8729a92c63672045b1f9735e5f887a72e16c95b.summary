-- the @entity1 minesweeper that grounded on a @entity4 reef last week has taken on water and sustained too much damage to be towed off , the @entity1 says			1
" it 's got hull penetrations in several places , and there is a significant amount of water inside the ship , " rear adm. @entity7 said at a briefing thursday			1
the @entity1 said it will use ship - borne cranes and heavy - lift vessels to lift the minesweeper , the @entity19 , off the @entity20			1
" as the crane ships arrive , we will take items off the @entity19 to lighten the weight of the ship so we are able to remove it from the reef , " @entity7 said			1
" the option that we had hoped to tow the ship off the reef is not available			1
the ship is too badly damaged			1
" the @entity19 would be removed from the area on a barge or other ship , @entity7 said			1
" the ship can not move on its own , and it is not operational , " he said			2
the 224 - foot - long , 1,312 - ton ship was on its way from @entity39 , @entity4 , to its next port call in @entity41 when it struck the reef , about 80 miles ( 130 kilometers ) east - southeast of @entity43 in the @entity44 , on january 17			1
initial efforts to free the @entity46 at high tide were unsuccessful			0
its crew of 79 was evacuated to other vessels , and the ship was battered by waves that pushed it farther onto the reef			1
@entity7 said the @entity19 now rests about 20 to 30 meters ( 22 to 33 yards ) from the edge of the reef			1
originally , only its bow was on the reef , but waves have now pushed the entire ship onto it			1
@entity63 , a @entity1 spokesman in @entity64 , said friday that the heavy - lift vessels would arrive at the grounding site in about a week			0
the guided missile destroyer @entity68 , the oceanographic survey ship @entity70 and the rescue and salvage ship @entity73 , as well as tugboats and @entity4 navy and coast guard vessels , are on station , he said in an e-mail to @entity0			0
" extracting the ship safely , while minimizing further damage to the reef , is a very complex process that requires careful and detailed planning and specialized equipment , " @entity63 said			2
" although we are moving as expeditiously as possible , we want to ensure it is done safely while minimizing damage to the reef and surrounding environment			0
" it could take two weeks to remove the @entity19 from the reef , @entity7 said			1
" we are committed to moving the ship from the reef as soon as possible			2
... that is the focus of all our efforts , " he said			0
the @entity1 said friday that the ships on station have removed about 15,000 gallons of diesel fuel from the @entity19			2
@entity7 said there have been no signs of oil or fuel leaking into the waters above the reef , which is a @entity4 national park and @entity108			1
the reef is home to a vast array of sea , air and land creatures , as well as sizable lagoons and two coral islands			0
about 500 species of fish and 350 species of coral can be found there , as can whales , dolphins , sharks , turtles and one of the last surviving colonies of breeding seabirds in the region , according to @entity130			0
@entity4 officials said this week that the @entity4 would seek compensation for damage to the reef			0
about 1,000 square meters ( about 10,760 square feet ) of the reef have been damaged			1
" it 's a damage to a world heritage site			0
it 's a damage to our natural resources			0
it 's a damage to an important site			0
we can not but put emphasis on the importance of this reef as a heritage site , " presidential spokesman @entity143 said			0
he said the salvage operation must ensure that the reef sustains no further damage			0
as to how the ship got stuck on the reef in the first place , @entity63 said the @entity1 is looking at a number of factors			2
he said the @entity157 @entity156 , which prepares the digital navigation charts used by the @entity1 , has reported the location of the reef was misplaced on a chart by nine miles			0
" the @entity1 investigation will review what charts @entity19 was using			2
while this erroneous navigation chart data is important information , no one should jump to conclusions , " @entity63 said			0
" it is critical that the @entity1 conduct a comprehensive investigation that assesses all the facts and circumstances surrounding the @entity19 grounding			2

the @entity19 has several holes in its hull , *admiral* says
the 1,300 - ton minesweeper will have to be lifted onto a barge
the ship damaged more than 10,000 square feet of the @entity20
