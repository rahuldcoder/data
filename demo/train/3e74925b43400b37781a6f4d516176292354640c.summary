-- the @entity2 administration will sue to halt a @entity4 requirement that voters show identification at the polls , signaling a new effort on voting rights enforcement following a @entity12 @entity11 ruling this year that threw out a key part of a landmark federal law			1
the @entity15 said on thursday that had put in motion a plan to seek a court order declaring that the strict 2011 @entity4 law violates the @entity20 and certain constitutional guarantees			1
" today 's action marks another step forward in the @entity15 's continuing effort to protect the voting rights of all eligible @entity12 , " attorney general @entity22 said in a statement			1
" the department will take action against jurisdictions that attempt to hinder access to the ballot box , no matter where it occurs , " he added			0
a divided 5 - 4 @entity11 in june invalidated the formula used to determine which states or local jurisdictions -- mostly in the @entity37 -- could remain under special federal oversight , requiring approval from @entity40 before they can change voting procedures			1
that blunted much of the government 's enforcement power in states and localities with a history of discrimination at the polls			0
but the decision did not change the fact it remains illegal to discriminate against a person when it comes to voting			0
but it does change how some states have been singled out			0
@entity22 said previously the administration would use a different section of the @entity20 that allows federal authorities to ask a judge to order a state to be placed under the preclearance regime			2
to do so the @entity15 must prove " purposeful " discrimination			0
@entity4 will be test case of that tactic but a @entity15 spokesman said prosecutors may pursue similar action in other states with similar laws			1
@entity4 is the subject of two ongoing court fights over its voter identification law and the voting boundaries created by the legislature			1
@entity4 gov. @entity76 reacted sharply to the move , building on previous comments from state officials that the administration was trying to circumvent the @entity11 decision			1
" the filing of endless litigation in an effort to obstruct the will of the people of @entity4 is what we have come to expect from attorney general @entity22 and president @entity2 , " he said in a statement			1
" we will continue to defend the integrity of our elections against this administration 's blatant disregard for the 10th amendment			0
" the @entity15 also announced on thursday that it would file a motion to intervene in one of the redistricting cases , allowing it to formally present evidence about the impact of the state 's new voting map			0
a federal court in the @entity40 had previously held that @entity4 had failed to show that its redistricting plan and the voter id law did not discriminate			2
but the @entity11 decision vacated that ruling			2
the @entity106 praised the decision to challenge @entity4 , saying that @entity4 had a history of suppressing @entity109 and @entity110 voters			2
" the voter id law in @entity4 is a solution in search of a problem			2
a @entity4 voter is more likely to be struck by lightning than to see someone attempt to vote fraudulently at the polls , " @entity115 , president and director - counsel of the group 's legal defense fund , said in a statement			0
@entity0 's @entity124 and @entity125 contributed to this report .			0
