@entity0 , @entity1 -- the fishing boat speeds over blue waters of the @entity5 , leaving behind the devastation of mainland @entity1			1
pods of dolphins and flying fish dart over the frothy waves			2
ahead lies an island of pristine beaches			1
but reality on the @entity1 island , about 45 miles off the main island , is far from a tropical paradise			1
neglected by the government for years , the residents of @entity0 call their island " the forgotten @entity1			1
" now more than ever			2
the earth did n't rumble as hard in @entity0 on january 12 , but people are feeling a different sort of aftershock			1
" this whole island was sourced by @entity32 , " says capt. @entity24 , who has come in on this warm , humid tuesday with a team from the 24th @entity26 to assess the situation at @entity28 , the biggest community on the island			1
" the main source of income here is cash from the mainland , " he says			1
" now it is not flowing			2
" without much agriculture on the rugged , limestone island , people seek all their provisions -- including food -- by boat from the @entity1 capital and coastal cities such as @entity47 that were leveled in the killer quake			1
" we do n't produce anything here			2
just fish , " says @entity50 , who does odd manual labor jobs to earn a few dollars			2
after the quake , he says , prices skyrocketed			1
a pot of rice used to cost about 50 cents ; now it 's up to more than $ 1			1
@entity57 : @entity1 's missing and found " you buy what you can			1
if not a whole pot , then half a pot. this is how we are living , " he says			0
" this area was n't hit by the quake , but we are feeling it			1
" @entity68 is one of the poorest regions of @entity1 , the most destitute country in the @entity72 , where the per capita income is less than $ 400 and 80 percent of people are living under the poverty line			1
@entity24 says the quake is a severe blow to this impoverished and isolated community			1
" there is a very strong secondary effect in @entity0			0
" some of that is evident at the hospital in @entity28			0
@entity84 's mother has brought him here so that the @entity85 can help him			1
the 9 - year - old boy broke his right leg when a wall crumbled in november			0
he had pins placed in his leg in @entity32			1
they were supposed to have been removed the day before the quake			2
the boy is rushed in and placed on a gurney in a gaudily painted turquoise examination room that was sparse in the morning but by midday is teeming with the @entity98 's world - class medicines and expert doctors			2
lt. @entity100 suggests taking the boy back to the @entity102 for further treatment			0
@entity84 's mother puts a fresh shirt on him for the journey			2
@entity100 continues down the long line of patients , all of whom are expecting some of her short time here			0
full coverage they are suffering from acute injuries , both quake - related and not , and chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension			2
" they just do n't have that access to care , " @entity100 says			2
" they do n't have specialists here or anything like x-rays to internal medicine , any kind of surgery			0
they were relying on @entity32 , and they have lost that			1
" the @entity131 carry the crippled boy to a humvee and journey down the main route through @entity28 : @entity136			1
despite the name , time seems to have stood still in this town of limestone huts and a few dilapidated or half - finished buildings			0
layers of dust cover everything , as though the quake had struck violently here			2
the only signs of modern civilization are the two cell towers owned by @entity149 and @entity150 and a series of hand - painted green street signs , an odd site in a place where vehicles are lacking license plates			0
a sudden burst of magenta bougainvilleas catches the eye amid the drab			0
at the beach , crowds have amassed to watch the @entity85 who came to help			1
@entity164 is one of them			0
he , like many other young people from @entity0 , left his birthplace several years ago to seek education in @entity32			1
he was studying theology at the @entity170			0
finding shelter , aid , supplies on the day of the quake , he escaped with his sister			1
his house and his college , he says , were destroyed			0
afraid of the sizeable aftershocks that continued to jolt the city , afraid of the death all around him , @entity164 took a boat back to @entity0			0
he says he does n't know where his parents are			0
nor his other seven siblings			0
he meanders through @entity28 in hopes of finding people who will provide him something to eat			2
he counts back the days to sunday , trying to recall when he last had a meal			0
" @entity189 , " he says			0
" and then some water			0
if you go to the water pipe , you can find some water			0
" some of my family is dead			0
the rest are very poor right now			0
my education is breaking down			0
it was everything to me			0
" he does n't even have the money to return to @entity32 to find loved ones			1
the boat rides cost anywhere from $ 6 to $ 8 , depending on whether it 's on a sailboat or a motorized one			2
under the glare of the afternoon sun , @entity164 gazes intently as the @entity131 load up their trucks and gear onto a monstrous landing craft utility boat that carried them to shore earlier in the day			1
residents watch in awe as though an alien spacecraft had landed from outer space			2
some have never even seen a television camera , let alone a state - of - the - art utility boat that comes by sea and travels on land , kicking up sand and gravel like a hurricane would			0
" the government of @entity1 is breaking down , " @entity164 says , his eyes set on the departing @entity131			1
" the only thing we can do now is wait for the @entity85			1
" then the @entity131 , who came with food and medicine , head for the sea			1
they do n't see the sign at the tiny port			0
" thank you for visiting @entity28			0

residents of @entity238 call their island " the forgotten @entity1 "
the island is dependent on @entity32 for money , supplies
the quake spared island direct hit , but the residents are now cut off from main island
@entity252 's people are *hungry* and in need of medical care ; @entity85 @entity131 try to help
