-- after nearly 10 years of expertly skewering @entity2 pop culture and the television wasteland , @entity4 's clip show " @entity6 " is raising the stakes on its own program and will broadcast live for the first time to mark the series ' 500th episode			1
the show will air live on both coasts on august 21 at 10 p.m. at a recent taping for the 499th episode , host @entity15 and executive producer @entity16 spoke with reporters about the milestone and what @entity16 called the " high - wire effect " of the live show			1
" i have full - on dyslexia , " @entity15 said			2
" so that 'll be great			2
i think it really brings a sense of danger			2
" the 500th show will be a " soup " fans recognize , rather than a retrospective			1
" i think live is pretty much the trick , " @entity16 said			1
" we 'll have a couple of little surprises along the way with our special guests , but i think we as a show do better when the material is fresh and we have new jokes			1
" as of the interview , the special guests -- a different set for each coast -- include @entity46 , @entity47 and perhaps @entity48			2
( she was still pending			2
) @entity15 said he prefers a good mix. " it 's like getting a @entity51 at @entity52 , " he quipped			2
as for dream guests in the future , he named @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , @entity58 because " apparently he has a fan base , " @entity59 from @entity60 and @entity61			2
" i would love for @entity61 ( to come on ) , " @entity15 said			2
" prince , open invitation			0
" and why not ? @entity15 said most guests enjoy their experience			0
" without exception , " he said , " every single reality star i have ever met has said , ' please put me on your show ' or ' thank you for having me on your show and may i come back on ? ' no one has gone , ' how dare you ? ' " still , the host admitted he never thought " @entity6 " would last			1
" we have a 50 - year plan , " he joked			0
" this is phase one			0
phase two is the next 10 years			0
" but seriously , " i never thought it would go this long			0
no one ever thought that			0
" there was always the sense , especially in the first couple of years , that no one was watching , kind of like public access			0
and that sense that people still are n't watching has never left			0
" " the tv landscape has changed over the time that we 've been doing ( the show ) , " @entity16 said			1
" we '' ve talked about how we 're going to change things because ' @entity97 ' became more popular than the scream - at - each - other - and - puke - in - the - foyer - shows " that were the show 's bread and butter early on			1
" the success ( of ' the soup ' ) is we take all of the mayhem that exists out there and bring it under one roof			0
but what that is changes all the time			0
" currently the show 's staff is obsessed with " @entity114 ? " the goofy murder mystery show on @entity116			1
" the clips are n't necessarily the most provocative , but the show has been driving the staff out of its mind all summer			1
there 's no tension , " he said			0
" and we love it			0
" though it 's hard to remember most of the clips the show has churned through over the 500 episodes , some , like @entity133 on " being @entity134 " and @entity135 on " @entity136 , " naturally stand out			1
but it 's " @entity138 " that @entity15 calls " the greatest moment we ever had			0
" when @entity15 is not taping " @entity6 , " he 's busy filming movies and starring on @entity141 's " @entity140			1
" the show 's fifth season features the return of " @entity140 " creator @entity145 , and while @entity15 modestly underplayed his role in getting @entity145 back , it has been said he was instrumental			1
" ( @entity145 ) created the show and the show is in his voice , so to have it back in his voice i think was important , " @entity15 told @entity0			1
" i was thrilled that he wanted to come back and that @entity151 was willing to have him back , so i 've never been creatively happier			0

" @entity6 " marks its 500th episode milestone
