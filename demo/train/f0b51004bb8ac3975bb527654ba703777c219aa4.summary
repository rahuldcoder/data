at the same time , @entity3 's defense was free to suggest to the judge that probation would be more appropriate , @entity66 said , and the final call would lay with the judge			1
" at no time did this office ever seek -- or ever tell mr. @entity3 's attorneys that it intended to seek -- maximum penalties under the law , " she concluded			1
