former cia director @entity0 testified on @entity1 friday that the attack on the @entity4 @entity3 in @entity5 , @entity6 , in september was an act of terrorism committed by @entity10 - linked militants			1
that 's according to @entity4 rep. @entity12 , @entity14 - @entity13 , who spoke to reporters after a closed hearing in the @entity17 , which lasted an hour and 20 minutes			1
@entity12 said @entity0 ' testimony differed from an earlier assessment the former @entity21 director gave lawmakers just days after the september 11 attack , which left four @entity4 dead , including @entity4 ambassador @entity24			1
" he ( @entity0 ) ... stated that he thought all along he made it clear that there was significant terrorist involvement , and that is not my recollection of what he told us on september 14 , " @entity12 said			1
" the clear impression we were given ( in september ) was that the overwhelming amount of evidence was that it arose out of a spontaneous demonstration , and was not a terrorist attack , " he said			2
@entity4 officials initially said the violence erupted spontaneously amid a large protest about a privately made video produced in the @entity4 that mocked the @entity43			1
the intelligence community later revised its assessment , saying it believes the attack was a planned terrorist assault			1
@entity12 said that the word spontaneous was minimized during @entity0 ' testimony friday , which was given one week after he resigned from the @entity21			1
lawmakers said they did n't ask him about why he left the agency			2
@entity0 has admitted an extramarital affair with his biographer			1
critics of the administration have suggested that his resignation might be linked to fallout over the attack			1
what do we know so far about the @entity0 scandal ? the @entity5 attack became a political hot button during a presidential election year and raised questions regarding issues such as security at the compound and the @entity70 administration 's initial description of the events			1
@entity12 told reporters that he likes @entity0 and that it was uncomfortable , at times , to interview a man he considers a friend			1
" he was a strong soldier			0
very professional , very knowledgeable , very strong , " @entity12 said			1
" he 's a solid guy			0
i consider him a friend , which made the questioning tough			0
you realize the human tragedy here			0
" after he spoke at the @entity84 hearing , @entity0 testified in front of the @entity86			1
he was ushered into both sessions without reporters being able to get a camera shot of him , and after he testified he left the premises , @entity87 learned			0
@entity0 was not asked to testify under oath , @entity12 said			1
@entity12 and other lawmakers said @entity0 testified that his resignation had nothing to do with the consulate attack			1
that matches what @entity0 told @entity99 of @entity100 , @entity87 's sister network			1
he said his resignation was solely a result of his extramarital affair with his biographer , @entity104			2
he added that he never passed classified information to her			0
prior to friday 's hearings , it was thought that @entity0 would tell lawmakers that the @entity21 knew soon after the attack that @entity111 was responsible for it , according to an official with knowledge of the case			1
the official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject matter			0
@entity111 is more of a label than an organization , one that 's been adopted by conservative @entity123 groups across the @entity125 world			0
related : what is @entity111 ? it was not known whether @entity0 spoke specifically about @entity111 during friday 's sessions			1
after the @entity131 hearing , rep. @entity128 , @entity129 , said the confusion over the consulate incident arose from there being essentially two threads of violence : one caused by the protest , which was chaotic , and a second that was orchestrated by terrorists , which was highly coordinated			2
there were " two different types of situations at play , " @entity128 said , explaining that in the hours and days after the attack , it was naturally difficult to clearly discern what happened			2
intelligence evolves , he said , and new information comes out when agents obtain it			0
he played down the idea that there was something untoward going on			0
@entity0 : i did not pass on classified information the former @entity21 chief has said there was a stream of intelligence from multiple sources , including video at the scene , that indicated @entity111 was behind the attack , according to an official with knowledge of the situation			1
meanwhile , separate intelligence indicated the violence at the consulate was inspired by protests in @entity172 over an ostensibly anti-islam film clip that was privately produced in the @entity4			1
the movie , " @entity175 , " portrayed the @entity43 as a womanizing buffoon			0
there were 20 intelligence reports that indicated that anger about the film may be to blame , the official said			0
the @entity21 eventually disproved those reports , but not before @entity0 ' initial briefing to @entity184 when he discussed who might be behind the attack and what prompted it			1
during that briefing , he raised @entity111 's possible connection as well as outrage about the film , the official said			0
earlier , an official said that @entity0 ' aim in testifying was to clear up " a lot of misrepresentations of what he told @entity184 initially			1
" @entity0 testified that he developed unclassified talking points in the days after the attack but he had no direct involvement in developing the ones used by @entity202 , the @entity4 ambassador to the @entity203 , @entity12 said			1
" no one knows , yet , exactly who came up with the final version of the talking points , other than to say the original talking points prepared by the @entity21 were different from the ones that were finally put out , " said @entity12 , stressing that the original talking points were more specific about @entity10 involvement			2
@entity211 has been under fire for suggesting the attack on the consulate was a spontaneous event spurred by a protest against the @entity218 film			2
the three unclassified talking points that were used by @entity211 on september 16 were read aloud to reporters on the @entity221			0
they are : -- the currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in @entity5 were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the @entity226 in @entity227 and evolved into a direct assault against the @entity4 diplomatic post in @entity5 and subsequently its annex			1
there are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations			0
-- this assessment may change as additional information is collected and analyzed and as currently available information continues to be evaluated			2
-- the investigation is ongoing , and the @entity4 government is working with @entity6 authorities to bring to justice those responsible for the deaths of @entity4 citizens			2
sen. @entity245 , the @entity247 @entity246 who leads the @entity86 , read the points to journalists and vigorously defended @entity211			0
@entity245 said lawmakers should be careful not to " pillory " someone for intelligence failings			2
" we have seen wrong intelligence before and it all surrounded our going into @entity255 , and a lot of people were killed based on bad intelligence , " she said			2
" and i do n't think that is fair game			0
i think mistakes get made			0
you do n't pillory the person			0
" to select ambassador @entity211 because she used an unclassified talking point , to say that she is unqualified to be secretary of state , i think , is a mistake , " the senior lawmaker said			2
" and the way it keeps going it is almost as if the intent is to assassinate her character			0
" there has been speculation that @entity211 was among the people being considered as a replacement for secretary of state @entity278 , if she steps down as she has indicated			0
but the committee 's senior @entity280 , @entity282 of @entity283 , said he does n't think the issue is settled			0
he said the concern is not whether the talking points were correct , but that @entity211 did n't go far enough			0
" she knew at that point and time that @entity10 was very likely responsible in part or in whole for the death of @entity24 , " he said , intimating that @entity211 should have said that			0
read a transcript of @entity211 's comments on @entity87 about the attack			0

rep. @entity12 says @entity0 ' account differs from an earlier assessment
a @entity4 ambassador and three others were killed in the @entity5 attack
lawmakers say @entity0 said his resignation had nothing to do with @entity5
