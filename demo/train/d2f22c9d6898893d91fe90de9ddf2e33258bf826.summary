" i can do whatever what i want , i can define myself in whatever way i want , " @entity3 told @entity2 from the capital of @entity1			1
" as a journalist , as a writer , as an artist , musician , black or white , @entity9 or @entity1 , and no one can tell me i ca n't be this , i ca n't be that			1
" @entity3 's multifarious personality has earned her celebrity status in @entity1 -- the fun - loving and free speaking performer has grown to become one of the country 's most instantly recognizable faces			1

" people always ask me , ' what is the most important thing for you ? is it the music , the journalism , what 's most important for you ? ' i need all of it			0
if i just do music , i get so tired of myself after a while that i have to do something else , and when i 'm just a journalist i really need to sing and write music or express myself in a more subjective way , so i need it all			0
" born in @entity0 in 1979 , @entity3 says her life has been much the same as anyone else 's but she 's quick to admit that growing up as a black person in @entity1 has impacted her in many ways			1
" when it comes to my identity as a @entity9 - @entity1 , my knowledge is really more about being a visible minority in @entity1 and being black in a white country			1
" from a very early age i started thinking , ' who am i , where do i belong and what kind of person do i want to be ? ' so i started to make my own platform in a way , somewhere i could be without people , without having to defend myself in a way ... i have my own room where i can be @entity9 , @entity1 , black or white			1
" one of her jobs as a presenter is to host an annual fundraising telethon for @entity1 broadcaster @entity78 that raises money for noteworthy causes			1
this year 's proceeds will be used to help and protect people fleeing from conflict in the @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , among others			2
much of @entity3 's knowledge about @entity90 comes from her @entity9 father , but she 's also traveled to the continent on a number of occasions			1
she recently visited the world 's largest refugee camp in @entity97 , @entity98 -- a trip that she says had a profound impact on her			0
" i met young people that are really ambitious , that really want to do something good with their lives			0
but they 're just victims of a war that they have no way of resolving , they are just stuck in a refugee camp so they have no way of fulfilling their dreams			0
" @entity3 says at this year 's telethon , she wants to use the experience drawn from this trip to highlight the challenges faced by refugees			1
" when you are a refugee you do n't always get your education			0
you are ripped out , you have to leave everything			0
and that 's the same if you are in @entity123 , or in @entity97 on the @entity86 border , or if you are in @entity125			0
" as a young person you need education , you need hope , you need somewhere to go , so the project they have regarding education is something i 'd like to talk more about at the telethon this year			2
" when @entity134 is not presenting shows on @entity1 television , she likes to indulge to her other passion -- performing			1
a talented singer in her own right , she has toured @entity1 several times both as a solo artist and as a member of @entity143 , a comedy group of five like - minded women			1
" people really tend to think of @entity143 as we are just black @entity1 but we are a very international group			2
because one girl is from @entity1 - @entity149 , one from @entity150 - @entity1 , one from @entity151 , one from @entity152 and me from @entity9 - @entity1			1
" we make fun of @entity1 and we also make fun of @entity90			2
and there is so much humor in the meeting between the different cultures			0
so to me it was about telling people about my experience as a black @entity1 woman but in a fun way			2
" @entity134 's musical interests led her to another project -- hosting the latest @entity166			2
it was an offer , she says , that she just could n't turn down			0
" i love a good challenge , that 's it			0
so when they asked me i could n't say no. it 's the biggest tv show in @entity78 history			2
i had to do it			0
how do you create that kind of show ? with three shows , with 18 000 people every time			0
and it was just a big challenge , i loved every minute of it			0
