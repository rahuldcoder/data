-- jurors heard differing stories thursday about the final moments of a 55 - year - old @entity5 woman , with prosecutors claiming her millionaire husband callously shot her while his lawyers characterized her death as a " tragic " accident			1
after three days of jury selection , @entity12 's trial kicked off in @entity14 with opening statements and testimony			2
@entity12 , 63 , is charged with second - degree murder over the september 21 , 2009 , death of his wife inside their upscale @entity21 home			1
" @entity25 was killed by a single gunshot wound as she struggled with her husband over a loaded a gun , " the defendant 's attorney @entity23 said			1
" this entire incident happened in a blink of an eye			0
her death was an unexpected and tragic accident			0
" but prosecutors painted a very different picture , casting doubt on @entity12 's unruffled demeanor and what they characterized as his ever - changing story of what happened			1
" this case is about the fact that it was @entity45 that shot her almost dead between the eyes , " said assistant state attorney @entity41 in her opening statement			0
she brought up the 911 call , placed at 7:50 p.m. that night , in which @entity12 called and flatly said , " i just shot my wife			2
" but later in the call , according to @entity50 , he started to change his story : " it becomes an accident and he does n't know what happened ... @entity25 just ended up on the floor			2
" according to the arrest affidavit from @entity60 , the victim was found in the master bedroom -- " a large pool of blood at the top of her head ( and ) a .357 @entity67 hand gun ( in ) the top drawer of a nightstand next to the bed			0
" @entity12 told police that the couple were the only ones in the house at the time , besides their four dogs			0
@entity50 also brought up how @entity12 acted upon arriving at the police station , during which investigators described him as " calm , polite and not really in distress			0
" in several videos from an interrogation room -- which the prosecutor promised would be played in court -- @entity12 offered an array of stories in phone conversations with family and friends , from " it was a tragic accident " to " @entity25 killed herself			1
" the next day , medical examiner @entity90 determined preliminarily that the mother of two college - age children had been killed in a homicide			0
prosecutors , in opening statements , highlighted the financial troubles facing @entity12 -- who , along with his wife , had been set to testify in bankruptcy proceedings related to one of his companies a few days before the shooting			2
@entity23 , though , insisted that in no way did his client benefit from his wife 's death : " from a financial standpoint , the death of @entity25 ruined @entity45 financially , " he said .			1
