-- what was arguably the most anticipated video game of 2012 just became one of the most anticipated games for 2013			2
@entity5 and @entity6 announced wednesday that " @entity10 " will be delayed four months to allow developers more time to make tweaks to the game			1
the third installment in a popular horror series , set in a dystopian undersea universe , will now be released on february 23 , 2013 , instead of this coming october as previously scheduled			1
creative director @entity14 made the announcement on @entity5 's website : " when we announced the release date of @entity10 in march , we felt pretty good about the timing , " he wrote			1
" since then , we 've come to realize that some specific tweaks and improvements will make @entity10 into something even more extraordinary			1
therefore , to give our talented team the time they need , we 've decided to move the game 's release to february 26 , 2013			1
we wanted to let our loyal ( and very patient ! ) fans know this as soon as possible			0
" i wo n't kid you : @entity10 is a very big game , and we 're doing things that no one has ever done in a first - person shooter , " he added			2
" what does this mean for you ? it means a bit more waiting , but more importantly , it means an even better @entity10			1
" @entity14 said developers will hold off on showing " @entity10 " this summer at such gaming events as @entity41 and @entity42			2
" that way , the next time you see our game , it will be essentially the product we intend to put in the box , " he said			0
" preparing for these events takes time away from development , time we 're going to use instead to get the best version of @entity54 into your hands in february			2
" fans have been waiting for the next creation in the " @entity10 " universe since " @entity10 " was released in 2010			1

one of great optimism and excitement for the future and one of this ominous feeling at the same time , " he said			0
