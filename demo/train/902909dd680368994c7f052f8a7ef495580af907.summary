-- i 'm in a @entity3 hotel room , hiding from @entity4			1
the odds are not in my favor			1
this is not a war on , jihad against or campaign to counter anyone else 's annual allotment of holly jolly joy			1
if it were up to me , i 'd quietly exile myself from the merrymaking so as not to dim others ' bliss like a burned - out bulb on an otherwise twinkly light strand			2
i 'm not a @entity20 or a @entity21 or any of the other soot - stained slurs hurled by people fed up with a loved one 's reluctance to join the reindeer games			1
what i am is depressed			2
in the cold , dark , ash - end of the dying year , it is hard for me to pry my head from my pillow and draw breath into my lungs -- let alone don gay apparel and fa - @entity36 along with the rest of the festive public			2
but i do it -- alongside countless other people suffering from seasonal affective disorder , active grief , debilitating panic , ptsd and a whole host of other emotional issues that are thrown into sharp relief amid the mandatory revelry			1
i do n't want to drag anyone else into my darkness and take the shimmer off their star			2
i try to slough off my dull gray sweater and don a gaudy holiday number that i hope will distract from the listlessness in my eyes and my affect , and i will myself to snap out of it			2
that may successfully deflect attention from friends and family caught up in holiday chaos , but i am thoroughly unable to force myself into a state of good cheer			2
the attempt makes it worse			2
" i think there must be something wrong with me , @entity70			2
@entity4 is coming , but i 'm not happy			2
i do n't feel the way i 'm supposed to feel			2
... i like getting presents and sending @entity4 cards and decorating trees and all that , but i 'm still not happy			0
i always end up feeling depressed			0
" read more : going public with depression as a child , it was surprising and oddly comforting to see my strange feelings articulated by a beloved cartoon character amid the @entity83 cheer of holiday tv specials			1
but then again , i have always identified with poor ol ' @entity86 -- and the response his confession of yuletide unease received from his peers			0
" @entity86 , you 're the only person i know who can take a wonderful season like @entity4 and turn it into a problem			1
" nope -- not just you , @entity86			0
the rest of us just do n't talk about it for fear that the @entity99 of the world will pass judgment ; if you ca n't join in the joy of the most wonderful time of the year , you are clearly defective			0
you are a misfit toy , minus the solidarity of an island full of kindred spirits			0
even for those who do n't struggle with chronic or seasonal depression , there are myriad reasons why some approach december with dread			1
for many who have who always celebrated holidays with warmth and abandon , there 's a raw and tender spot where a departed family member used to be			1
even if the grief is not fresh , the rites and rituals that once brought such delight now awaken the ache of loss			0
for others , economic strain , family estrangement , the pressure of others ' expectations , overtaxed schedules and plain old exhaustion can mount and crush the happiness out a season that was previously a source of comfort			1
but rarely , if ever , are we given a strings - free opportunity to opt out			0
" it 's only once a year ! " a friend said to me just yesterday , kvetching about her sister - in - law 's reluctance to suck it up and make merry			1
i 've never met the woman , but i had to argue on her behalf			0
i come from a family in which @entity4 e-mails have become an acceptable level of holiday hoopla , but have married into a family heavily invested in the celebration			0
as much as i love and cherish every member of my husband 's massive multigenerational clan , their celebrations operate at an unfamiliar frequency			1
being launched into the holiday machine with a family that celebrates bigheartedly , boisterously and lavishly became a source of yearly panic and dread for me			0
i was terribly ashamed of myself for feeling that way			0
yes , it 's only once a year , but my mother - in - law is nearing 90			1
the desire to deliver the brand of holiday she 's come to expect added so much weight to the event , i 'd find myself almost unable to breathe at the very thought of it			1
read more : @entity178 : sharing experiences then i 'd fret that someone would notice my distress ( they did ) and take it personally if i slipped away to compose myself			0
( where 's @entity184 ? she 's taking a nap again ? does n't she want to spend time with us ? ) after several years of that stress , i realized something was going to have to give -- and it was going to have to be me			1
i ca n't say i 'm ever going to actively enjoy @entity4 , but i love my family ( and myself ) enough to make the most out of it and have found ways to manage my seasonally fragile mood in a way that might minimize upset from either side			0
i save up my vacation days , hotel points and and frequent - flier miles to visit somewhere sunny -- usually @entity3			1
while trees , cheeky holiday decor , and jazzed - up carols have begun to encroach upon this den of depravity and excess , it 's still a relatively safe haven for @entity4 cranks like me , and the darkness sets in a shade later than it does back home			1
on the ground at @entity209 with the in - laws , my husband and i have taken to getting a hotel room , rather than staying with family			0
though that may not be the most economically sensible option , we do n't have to worry about overtaxing anyone 's generosity , and the autonomy offers a little breathing room that helps me more calmly and thoroughly appreciate the time we spend together in celebration			1
once in the familial fray , i try to make myself as useful as humanly possible			0
need that platter washed ? gim me ! we 're out of cinnamon ? where are the car keys ? the children need someone to chase around the yard to wear them out ? whooooooooosh ! and i 've added my own ritual to the mix -- crafting multiple pitchers of rye sours made with freshly - squeezed lemons and clementine juice			0
it busies my hands for at least an hour , lightly buzzes the crowd for a couple more and i get to spend one - on - one time with each person as i serve them			0
it has by all accounts been a most welcome addition to the holidays , and for a while our moods align happily and brightly			1
this may not be ideal for every family , but we make the most of what we 've been given			0
i 'll take my @entity4 spirit any way i can get it			0
