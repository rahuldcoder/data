-- it was tuesday evening when i happened upon a popular @entity4 link to a story on @entity7 website praising the record - breaking success of @entity9 at @entity10 , which has now sold more than 100 million crunchy , nacho - cheesy bundles of love			1
one hundred million ! think about it			1
at about 6 inches long , if you stacked each of these 100 million tacos lengthwise from end to end , you would be ... doing something very pointless			1
now , for those of you who have n't actually seen a @entity23 in person ( i.e. productive citizens who do n't drink past 2:30 in the morning ) they 're just what they sound like			2
tacos ... wrapped in shells ... made from giant @entity9			1
it 's amazing ! it 's culinary @entity32 ! it 's as if @entity10 's marketing executives were poking around in my dreams			1
( note : i dream about @entity9 and tacos			1
and lately there 's also been a lot of gnomes			1
things are weird at home			2
) as i write this , it 's 10:13 a.m. on wednesday			1
early as it may be , i feel i ca n't properly do this column justice without having at least one of these tacos in front of me , allowing partially hydrogenated soybean oil to be my muse			2
( which is a slight departure from the 4,000 ounces of @entity53 i usually look to for inspiration			0
) so , you all hang tight			0
i 'm heading downstairs to the food court and putting you on hold for a moment			0
( click ) do you believe in life after love ? i can feel something inside me say i really do n't think you 're strong enough			0
( click ) i 'm back and i am so sorry for that			0
it 's the only radio station we get here			2
but it could be worse , i once dropped five dollars in a jukebox , played @entity71 's " believe " on repeat with all my credits , and walked out			2
it 's probably the meanest thing i 've ever done in my entire life			2
so , overall , i do n't think i 'm such a bad guy			0
useless to society , yes			0
apparently this matters : $ 1,300 hdmi cables but let 's get back to these tacos			2
the @entity7 cites an article by @entity80 in the @entity81 that says this has been the " most successful product launch in @entity10 's 50 - year history			1
" the article then quotes a @entity10 spokesman who says the @entity84 has finally been " dethroned			1
" which is more than a little unsettling			0
look , i 'm just saying , if you represent @entity10 , perhaps using the word " throne " is n't the smartest idea			1
nevertheless , i 'm proud to say that i am one of the millions who have helped the @entity9 become absolute world - beaters			1
i do n't love them , but i do love the idea			0
it screams " @entity97 ! " as i proudly shed a single red , white and blue teardrop			0
it 's also possible that i have eye - herpes			2
is that a thing ? anyway , i spent some time on the @entity10 website today , mostly because it was a nice departure from doing actual work , and learned that they recommend you eat one of these with a @entity108			1
someone received payment for pondering this pairing , and i 'm sort of bummed that it was n't me			0
thus , i have to ask : how does one become the official @entity10 sommelier ? " hi , @entity114			1
tell us , what makes you uniquely qualified for this position ? " " the ability to point at things on your menu			0
" one hundred million tacos or not , sentiments on the @entity4 comment section for this link seemed to generally agree that , after about ten weeks of being in stores , @entity9 get an overall grade of : @entity128			1
@entity129 wrote : tried one			0
do n't see what all the fuss is about			2
barely even tasted the @entity133			0
@entity134 agrees : i have eaten 8 of those loco tacos and they aint all that			0
if i am goin @entity139 i prefer chipotle			0
and when @entity139 are going @entity139 , they prefer ... actual @entity139			0
but might i also suggest a 2012 @entity108 ?			1

@entity0 's @entity143 *deciphers* the online fuss over @entity9
more than 100 million @entity9 have been sold
@entity9 could " dethrone " the @entity84
@entity10 recommends a @entity108 with the meal
