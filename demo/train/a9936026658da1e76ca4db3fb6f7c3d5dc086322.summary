@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 scoops mashed potatoes and peas onto her plate , not quite sure of the history behind her first @entity9 meal			1
but she knows how thankful she is to be at a church in @entity0 this november , lining up for turkey , stuffing and pecan pie			2
@entity3 took a break to enjoy a @entity9 meal with fellow refugees			1
three years ago she grabbed her son , now 12 , and fled @entity17			1
her husband , a carpenter who worked for @entity19 , had left for the market one day in @entity21 and never returned			1
@entity22 says she knows he is dead , even though she has never seen his body			2
when the rest of her family started to receive death threats , she felt she had no choice but to run			2
@entity22 and her son , @entity28 , made it across the border to @entity31 and later entered the @entity19 , two of more than 15,000 @entity17 refugees to be allowed in since the beginning of the war in 2003			1
the @entity9 meal , served at the @entity37 to dozens of refugees from far - flung places like @entity40 and @entity41 as well as @entity17 , is a welcome break for @entity22 , who is struggling to build a new life			1
unable to translate her skills as a @entity21 salon owner into a job as a stylist , @entity22 does not have the money to pay $ 625 due in rent			2
" i have an electricity bill to pay , i have no job , " she says			2
" i have no way of knowing what to do			0
" government and aid group assistance to refugees does not last long			2
@entity22 plans to ask an aid group , the @entity57 , for more help , but she 's not sure what else she can do			2
soon she hopes her 21 - year - old daughter will arrive from @entity31 and bring with her better luck			0
" my daughter is coming and hopefully i will work , " she says , as @entity63 dancers in elaborate costumes entertain the diners			0
across the room , more and more refugees line up for the potluck dinner			1
" do n't worry , there will be enough food , " a man tells his two daughters , asking them to wait patiently			0
the man , @entity75 , and his wife , @entity76 , hoped , like so many immigrants before them , that the @entity19 would help them find a better life for them and their children			1
but the couple , who asked that their identities be protected for fear of reprisals against their family and friends still in @entity17 , are considering ending their @entity19 dream after three months of struggle			1
college - educated and proficient in @entity93 , @entity76 and @entity75 were shocked that the skills that provided them a comfortable living in @entity21 , as a mechanical engineer and lab technician , are of little advantage in an increasingly competitive @entity19 job market			1
they spend much of their day at the @entity57 office in @entity0 , searching for employment , but are considering returning to @entity105 , where they say they can find work , albeit illegally			0
" i am worried that i will be thrown out on the street , " @entity76 says			0
" my @entity111 neighbors could n't find work and they were evicted and thrown out on the street			0
we are worried the same will happen to us			0
many refugees we know have not found work and they have been here for eight months to a year			2
" until 2007 , very few @entity17 refugees were resettled in the @entity19			1
for 2008 , the @entity121 administration set a goal of accepting 13,000 @entity17			1
most of the estimated 2.2 million people who have fled @entity17 since the invasion are in @entity31 and @entity105 , many living illegally			1
their presence is straining infrastructure and social services there and driving food and housing prices higher			0
far from the warmth of the @entity9 party , another @entity17 refugee has managed to find work at a supermarket seafood counter , helping customers with their requests for jumbo shrimp and crab cakes			1
" i am like a manager , " says @entity141 , with a glimmer of pride in his eye			0
" i thank @entity146 that i have a job and that i am lucky			0
" @entity141 , who also asked that his identity be protected , was a college - educated artist and shop owner in @entity21			0
he fled @entity17 with his wife and three children after he was run off the road and shot in the side on his way home from work			1
a friend who was with him died in the assault			0
@entity141 is now able to support his family with the aid of food stamps and hopes that his wife will find a job to help out financially			0
nevertheless , he has been able to afford internet service for his children and a car			0
that kind of @entity19 dream is all @entity22 wants as she stands at a bus stop , bundled in her head scarf and winter coat , the music and laughter of the @entity9 dinner now just a distant memory			1
she is on her way to the local farmers market , where she plans to spend the morning waiting in line with 40 or 50 other people hoping to work			0
@entity22 says she has hope			0
" i wish for my children to be like [ the @entity19 ] , " she says in @entity183			1
" i wish they would have their own car , home , job -- to be @entity19			1
" i wish that because in my country , unfortunately , i did not see that			0
not during @entity192 's time or this new government			2
i wish i was still young			0
i would have left @entity17 a long time ago			2

@entity17 refugee @entity3 enjoys *festivity* of first @entity19 @entity9 dinner
she 's still struggling ; some @entity17 ready to give up while others are established
more than 15,000 @entity17 refugees have entered @entity19 since war began
