-- when @entity3 won the @entity4 on home soil their triumph was hailed as a unifying force for a country with a difficult colonial past and where racial tensions were never far from the surface			1
the team was labeled the @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 ( @entity12 , @entity15 , @entity16 ) because of the seamless mix of @entity19 - born and dual - nationality players who conquered the football world with a shock 3 - 0 win in the final against the favored @entity24			1
but fast forward 13 years and leading @entity19 politicians , current star players players and influential media commentators are among many to voice fears that the legacy of social integration engendered by that glorious night in the @entity3 has been severely tarnished , if it every existed			2
@entity19 talent drain no excuse for quota deputy @entity33 , a prominent member of the @entity34 , who was a candidate in the 2002 presidential elections , was always skeptical that it marked a sea change in @entity19 attitudes to race			1
" 1998 was an illusion and a short one , " she told @entity0 , pointing out that less than three months later a @entity19 government minister called black youths " young savages			1
" @entity33 , who is in the socialist group in the @entity34 , believes that until " all citizens are treated equally " @entity19 society will continue to have problems of racial integration			1
with presidential elections looming in @entity3 next year , she believes the problem stems from the very top and is calling on @entity50 to promote diversity and give more opportunities to @entity3 's immigrant population			2
@entity33 is a persistent critic of @entity50 , particularly for his spells as @entity19 interior minister from 2002 - 07 where his hardline approach to disorder in neighborhoods with a largely @entity60 population came under the spotlight			1
" i told him back in 2002 that he was organizing a civil war in this country , " she added			0
@entity33 's comments come in the wake of the decision by the @entity19 sports minister @entity68 to clear national football coach @entity13 in the " race quotas row " which has provoked an angry reaction from critics			1
@entity13 , who succeeded @entity72 last summer , was captured by a secret recording allegedly discussing the introduction of quotas for young players , aged 12 and 13 , based on their racial background			1
the implication was that a smaller percentage of youngsters of dual nationality would be admitted to the famed @entity19 football academies , which act as the breeding ground for talent such as @entity86			2
national technical director @entity87 , who allegedly promoted the idea to @entity13 , remains suspended by the @entity89 ( @entity90 )			1
@entity93 , who wrote the acclaimed book " @entity91 made in @entity92 , " was scathing in his criticisms of the reported conversations between @entity97 and @entity98			0
" you expect these people to be clever and set up a scheme for the future , " he told @entity0			0
" instead they talked like a couple of stupid drunks			0
" @entity93 does not believe @entity13 was intentionally racist , but points to the " wide gap between the people playing football and those running it , who are mostly white and over fifty years of age			2
" he goes on : " back in 1998 the only person saying there was too much diversity was ( @entity114 leader ) @entity115 , now it seems everything that is not @entity117 and white is considered a threat			2
" @entity122 , @entity123 correspondent for @entity124 , told @entity0 that the @entity97 affair was another example of the institutional racism which he believes permeates @entity19 society			1
he also does not believe @entity13 is a racist but highlights the appointment of his predecessor @entity72 as an example of the problem			2
@entity72 got the job in 2004 ahead of @entity136 - born former star player @entity135			0
" i 'm sure it was down to @entity135 's color rather than ability , " he claimed			2
the race issue flared again as @entity72 's tenure as national coach ended with their humiliating exit from 2010 @entity4 in @entity145			1
@entity147 's @entity146 was sent home after a heated exchange with @entity72 , prompting a brief strike by his fellow squad members			2
" people said there was a clan of black players in the @entity19 squad at the @entity4 , and we then saw the true face of @entity3 , " @entity146 told @entity123 reporters last december ahead of @entity147 's @entity154 tie against @entity155			1
" when the @entity3 team fails to win people start talking straight away about the players ' skin colors and religious beliefs			0
" when times get tough we find out what people really think			0
they said @entity171 had hit @entity172 -- @entity171 the @entity173 , and @entity172 the good @entity19 boy			2
" @entity146 's views are echoed by @entity177 central defender @entity176 , who played for @entity3 at under - 21 level , but with dual nationality opted to play for @entity180 in full internationals			0
@entity176 would represent an example of the issue identified by @entity13 and @entity98 whereby a player is trained in the @entity19 system then opts to play for a country of his or his parents ' birth			1
in a candid interview with @entity123 's @entity191 newspaper in the wake of the race quotas affair , @entity176 criticized @entity19 society for its lack of diversity			1
" i am not going to lie and say it is not more difficult in @entity3 than it is in @entity198 to find work if you have a big beard , for example			0
that is just a fact			0
" in @entity198 , it is more open and that is why people come here because they know that they will get a chance , no matter how they dress or where they are from			0
" @entity19 society still has to work with its approach to foreign people , " he was quoted			2
@entity213 , president of the @entity214 in @entity3 , has no doubt that prejudice is rife in his country and his organization is calling for a full judicial inquiry into the @entity97 affair			1
" we are talking here about children of 12 years of age , who have not chosen to be bi-national , " he told @entity0			0
" these kids are being denied access to training and i call this discrimination			0
the lack of diversity in the @entity90 structures paves the way for institutional racism , " he added			1
a spokesman for the @entity90 strongly denied these claims but refused to comment on specific issues			1
" the file is not closed , we 're actually working on the disciplinary procedures and , following internal regulations and working laws in @entity3 , we are avoiding all comments on this topic , " said @entity238 , the chief press officer for the federation			0
the historical facts would indeed appear to counter accusations that players from ethnic minorities and other backgrounds are discriminated by the selectors of the @entity19 national team			1
the first black player to represent @entity3 was @entity255 in 1931 and he played in the @entity257 team that featured three players from @entity60 descent for the first time			0
sons of @entity263 immigrants to @entity3 such as @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266 were key members of the 1958 team which reached the semifinals			0
in the 1990s , the squad boasted representatives of most of the @entity19 dependencies , not to mention many @entity60 countries such as @entity274 which previously came under @entity19 rule			1
the star player of the 1998 team , @entity278 , was born in @entity155 to @entity280 parents			0
far - right leader @entity281 may have been a lone voice when he said that team was not sufficiently " @entity19 , " but in 2002 he reached the second round of the presidential elections and @entity288 - born @entity287 and other national teammates went public and urged voters to reject him			1
they duly did , although support for @entity281 and his daughter @entity296 's @entity295 remains strong in several regions of @entity3			0
@entity93 believes that until " immigration is seen as a benefit not a threat " his country will continue to have problems			0
" it 's a question of leadership , " he said .			0
