-- high in the hills between @entity2 and @entity3 in the @entity4 sits a huge construction site its developers hope will transform the lives of @entity8 for generations to come			1
@entity10 is the first planned city of its kind and is not short on ambition			1
the renderings for the $ 1 billion development show many shiny amenities that might seem out of place in an area that has a per capita income of $ 1,610			2
the vision for the project that began construction in january 2010 includes homes for 40,000 residents , a park , a 20,000 - seat amphitheater , a convention center and a theater			1
@entity30 , the @entity3 - born , @entity31 - educated entrepreneur behind the project , is going well beyond the traditional call of duty for a private developer			2
he is negotiating with international companies to ensure there are jobs ready for the city 's inhabitants , and is even building the waste water treatment plants , the water reservoirs and three public schools			1
" we were shocked when we realized we 'd have to build the schools , " he says			2
" that is something i did n't plan for			0
we appealed to the @entity8 government to come in and assist us with at least that , but unfortunately , they 're broke and have other priorities			2

for him , @entity10 is not just a housing development but an economic lifeline for the people in the @entity8 territory			1
the project , which employs 5,000 palestinians , is already the @entity4 's single biggest private sector employer			1
when the first tenants move in , ideally in january , he hopes the city will provide a further 1,500 jobs			1
" if you created 10 projects like this , you 'd create a huge difference in the @entity8 economy , " he says			1
the project is also his grassroots attempt at nation - building			2
a strong @entity8 economy , he argues , could one day be the answer to a fully independent @entity75			1
according to @entity76 , the spokesperson for @entity78 prime minister @entity77 , the project has support on both sides of the green line			0
" it 's not a zero - sum game , " he says			2
" if the @entity8 have a better economy and a healthier political system , and life is better for @entity75 , then life is better for us as well			1
it 's crucial that you augment the peace process with tangible economic steps , and @entity10 is definitely a tangible step that we support			1
" while @entity30 acknowledges that @entity10 does not represent the answer to all the problems facing a peace settlement , saying he " did n't design it thinking @entity78 and @entity75 would kiss and be happy , " he does harbor hopes that economic development will play a favorable role			1
" in signing a peace agreement , there are concessions to be made , and if people are happy with their lives , they will be more supportive of making those concessions and getting their leaders to sign the dotted line , " he says			0

" even if it got constructed and filled to capacity and became a thriving city , it will not change the underlying geo - political realities where @entity75 is divided between two different governments , or address the settlements , which remain the biggest hurdle , " says @entity111 , the vice president of @entity51 and @entity113 affairs for @entity114 , a global intelligence company			1
@entity122 also questions whether the @entity8 economy is strong enough to fill the units , the first 700 of which went on sale last month			1
though more affordable than other @entity4 properties , at $ 60,000 to $ 170,000 , their price tag is aimed at the middle class			0
" the @entity8 economy is in shambles			1
it does not have too many indigenous sources of revenue , " @entity111 says			0
@entity30 , however , says he 's already sold 90 % of the listed units			0
" we 're selling units as fast as we can process them right now , which is a great problem to have			0

the @entity4 does n't have a traditional mortgage system in place ; often , accommodation is paid for up front , in cash			0
in 2010 , the @entity150 and the @entity151 set up a $ 500 million mortgage fund that has revolutionized the @entity8 property market			2
" i 'd say 99 % of buyers at @entity10 would n't be able to afford it without financing , " says @entity30			1
" it 's a process you 're used to in the @entity31 , but it 's new to us , and takes four to five hours to go through an application			0
" however there remains the worry that buying -- let alone developing -- a property in the @entity4 is a risky investment			0
" let 's say some sort of strike begins in the @entity4 , or there 's spillover from @entity172 and @entity78 authorities have to crack down			0
this kind of project will obviously be vulnerable , " says @entity111			0
" the people funding this project will hit the brakes			0
" @entity30 acknowledges that @entity10 would be in trouble under such an occurrence , though it is not something that seems to cause him much distress			2
" a little downtrend in politics will hurt @entity10 , but never destroy @entity10 , " he says			2
" it may delay it another year , or two , or five , but it will never kill the idea			0

@entity10 is the largest privately - funded development project in @entity8 *history*
the finished project will include homes for 40,000 residents , a convention center and three schools
its construction provides 5,000 jobs , and there are hopes it will provide more after tenants move in
the project could lift the economy , but some say it wo n't change the region 's geo - political *instability*
