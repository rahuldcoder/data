" it 's a unique type of bar you 're not going to find most other places			1
" these " ruin bars " are mostly open in the summer , although some are starting to winterize their locations , so they can be open for more than the may - to - september season			0

@entity141 , @entity142 the five villages of @entity142 's popular @entity141 are ready for visitors again			1

a national park and @entity155 site , the villages do n't allow cars or motorbikes			0
" it 's very well - known but hard to reach , " @entity20 said			1

" they rebuilt the paths , the stone terraces are back , the vineyards are replaned , and the drainage is improved for the next flood			0

the region 's capital , @entity207 , has great museums			2
airports where architecture soars 6			0
@entity211 , @entity212 when travelers land in the capital of @entity212 , they tend to head out into the mountainous region of @entity217 , but the city itself is worth a visit			0
named a @entity200 for its medieval architecture , @entity211 is also home to one of @entity225 's homes and a @entity227 museum designed by @entity228 that includes other artists ' works			2
" we 're trying to call attention to @entity211 itself , " @entity20 said , calling it a very interesting mix of " historical , modern and edgy " things to do			0
although people think of @entity212 food as a bit stodgy , @entity20 raves about the locavore restaurants on the river than runs through town			2
try visiting in august , when the streets of @entity211 are filled with musicians , puppeteers , jugglers and other entertainers for the @entity249			0
@entity250 , @entity251 this year 's @entity252 , " @entity250 is one of those incredibly historic seaport towns along the @entity255 , " @entity20 said , and he 's not kidding			1
the town dates to 600 b.c. , when @entity257 first settled in the area			2
@entity251 's second - largest city is trying to shake off its reputation as a " gritty , dangerous seaport town , " @entity20 said			1
with the cultural capital designation , " a lot of money has been poured into new museums and public transportation			0

@entity286 in some ways , @entity286 's popularity is old news to @entity21 travelers , but a lot of people are seeing the coast			1
there will be a lot more attention on the country if it enters the @entity299 in july			0
" @entity300 is an interesting and underrated @entity9 capital , with a huge coffee and café scene , " @entity20 said			0
" if you have that image of @entity142 or @entity1 , sitting at a café and watching the world go by , that 's preserved in @entity286			1
" there 's also an extension of northern @entity142 cuisine because the border in @entity319 ( now @entity286 ) has jumped around , and the cuisine does n't abide by the border , " @entity20 said , pointing to @entity286 ' " same @entity142 love of cured meats and cheeses , " and there 's seafood on the @entity314 as well			1

the sites on the self - guided and tour - guide - led tours are so magnificent that fans and non-fans alike can appreciate their majesty			0
the @entity339 is @entity334 's only @entity200 , and it can be very crowded			1
although its basalt columns can appear to look constructed by the might of giant @entity349 , the causeway is actually the result of ancient volcanic activity			0
a new visitor 's center opened last year			2
the truly adventurous can walk the 16 - kilometer route from @entity339 to @entity355 , taking a moment to cross the @entity357			0
