@entity0 , @entity1 -- a dual - pronged effort to stop the oil gushing from @entity9 's runaway well in the @entity10 shows promise for this weekend , the head of the government 's response team said friday			1
but things are likely to get worse before they improve			0
late friday , retired coast guard adm. @entity14 said in a statement that he and energy secretary @entity16 had approved @entity9 's plan to install an oil - recovery vessel , the @entity19 , at the same time that a new cap is placed over the well , " which will require temporary suspension of the current top - hat containment system			1
" during the seven to 10 days that it will take to switch the caps , the 15,000 barrels of oil that the @entity28 ship has been collecting daily are expected to flow unimpeded into the water , he said			1
@entity14 said he approved the plan in order to take advantage of favorable weather predicted for coming days and because , once the switch is complete , the resulting capacity to contain oil " will be far greater than the capabilities we have achieved using current systems			1
" @entity9 spokesman @entity42 called it the " capping stack , " which he described as a larger , better - fitting seal than the one currently covering the well			1
the latter cap " can be removed quite quickly " and @entity9 will start replacing it with the " sealing cap " on saturday , he said			1
if successful , the operation could halt the gushing that started april 20 after an explosion that killed 11 people on the @entity54 in the @entity10			0
but any such fix would be temporary , he said			0
the permanent solution would still be completion of a relief well , he added			0
scientists have estimated 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil are spewing daily from @entity9 's breached @entity62 well			1
they have been basing their estimates on high - resolution video and data from acoustic devices used to measure density			0
but @entity14 said that , once the long - term containment cap is in place , scientists will for the first time have the empirical data they need to determine the true flow rate			1
" i would think once the capping device is on , we would get the most accurate flow rate to date , " he said			2
switching the containment cap could increase the amount of oil collected each day to 60,000 to 80,000 barrels , @entity14 said			1
under a new alignment , four vessels would participate in oil recovery , one more than the three currently involved			2
in a separate advance , federal responders expressed optimism friday about a new aerial weapon in their arsenal			0
a 178 - foot @entity90 blimp , the @entity91 , was flown from @entity0 to @entity92 , @entity93 , to be used to survey the disaster area as soon as saturday , depending on the weather			2
officials said they hope surveys from the blimp will help them cut the time needed to get skimmers to the scene of oil slicks			2
" having something at a low altitude that can stay on scene a very long time is extremely valuable , " @entity14 said			1
" we are anxious to see how it works			0
" the first relief well @entity9 is drilling in the @entity10 could intercept the leaking @entity62 well in seven to 10 days , @entity14 said thursday			1
but the time it will take to seal the well will depend on " where the oil is coming up through , where they can intercept , where they can put the mud in , where they can put the cement plug , " he said			2
also friday , the president 's @entity121 said it is hiring @entity123 , a deepwater drilling expert with 30 years of experience in the oil and gas industry and academia , to serve as its science adviser			2
the commission , comprising seven members appointed by president @entity131 , will hold public meetings monday and tuesday in @entity0			0
it is charged with determining the causes of the @entity54 disaster and recommending changes in policies and law to prevent any such future calamities			0
@entity121 spokesman @entity140 said the commission is also hiring @entity142 as its research director			0
@entity142 , an alumnus of the @entity145 administration , served as director of the @entity147 and headed the @entity148 at the @entity150 @entity149 during the 1990s			0
@entity2 's @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 contributed to this report			0

new : @entity14 and @entity16 approve @entity9 plan to switch caps
new : switch will take 7 to 10 days during which oil will flow unimpeded
oil spill commission hires 2 new experts
work on replacing the cap is to begin saturday
