-- as i write this from the breakfast bar in my house , i just now finished eating a @entity5 for lunch			1
those delicious , microwavable little bastards complete me			0
but , despite the fact that this particular food - like product does , in fact , emphasize the word " lean , " i did n't actually eat it because i 'm concerned about my weight			0
i ate it because i have embarrassingly low standards			0
tonight 's dinner : something edible			2
fortunately , i live alone and , unless my dog 's palate suddenly shifts from @entity22 as the gold standard for fine cuisine , there 's really nobody here to judge me			2
nevertheless , @entity5 do claim , at least by name alone , to be somewhat easy on the waistline			0
which is a good thing , because , according to a new trending study , heterosexual women may be more attracted to men who are thin			1
not surprisingly , 9 out of 10 belts agree			0
though , to be fair , that 10th belt is really kinky and likes being dominated			0
" yes ! yes ! stretch me to the limit ! oh , it hurts so good ! now burn me with your cigarette ! " " @entity39 , belt			0
" the study , first published in @entity43 and later reported in @entity44 , quickly became a popular read throughout the internet after it sort of debunked the idea that most women are instinctively drawn to guys who posses " evolved " macho features			1
or what you might call @entity53 : protective @entity54			0
this , of course , does n't necessarily mean that ladies are n't attracted to masculinity , but the recent findings by @entity60 of the @entity61 in @entity62 simply suggest women might subconsciously focus first on a man 's weight -- or lack thereof -- before rejecting him for other reasons			1
unfortunately , the finer details of the study get fairly complicated beyond that			2
but somehow it all oddly boils down to the strength of a man 's immune system			1
apparently , somewhere in a woman 's brain -- most likely in a weird , strategic spot that blocks her ability to care deeply about the importance of a baseball player 's on - base percentage -- there 's a little chunk of gray goo that instantly determines whether or not a man 's genes are worthy enough to pass on to future generations			1
for example , the average heterosexual woman 's brain will make the following immediate determinations : @entity93 : mate			2
@entity94 : proceed with caution			0
@entity96 : run like hell			0
and immunity , the study says , has long been considered a major factor in these immediate genetic determinations			2
so , tying this back to the importance of being thin , @entity60 explains , " we found that a man 's weight serves as a better indicator of the relationship between immune response and attractiveness than masculinity does			1
it is therefore more likely that @entity114 women use weight , rather than masculinity , in their subconscious judgments of a man 's immunity			1
" the interesting word there is " @entity114			1
" i do n't really know if it matters or not that the female lusting tendencies of a small @entity126 country of just over 2 million people have the honor of speaking for women all over the planet , but , alas , that 's who they used for the study			1
besides , where else should they have done their research ? @entity138 ? " according to our results , all women instantly swoon for a man in jorts			2
" unless it 's @entity96 .			0

" @entity149 " is @entity147 's weekly , offbeat look at the *social* web
this week , @entity151 *ponders* a popular study saying women *prefer* *skinny* men
or , at least women in @entity114 -- that 's where the study was *conducted*
science says it boils down to immune systems -- not jeans shorts
