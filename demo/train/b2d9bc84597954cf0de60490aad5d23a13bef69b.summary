-- child beauty pageants are a lot like crime coverage on local news			1
viewers complain there 's too much crime in local television news reports , and yet , the stations covering crime enjoy high ratings			0
people complain that child beauty pageants exploit young girls -- some as young as 3 or 4 who are donning makeup , high heels and fake tans -- and yet , the ratings for reality television shows such as @entity25 's " @entity24 " are sky high			1
we do n't like the idea of these beauty contests for kids , but it seems we ca n't pull ourselves away			2
but what if there were no pageants for kids to begin with ? if @entity36 lawmakers get their way , there would be no @entity36 version of " @entity24 " and no @entity36 " @entity39 , " referring to another child pageant reality star			1
the @entity41 in @entity36 voted to ban child beauty pageants for kids under the age of 16 and now the measure goes to the country 's lower house for debate and a vote			1
where did this anti-pageant momentum come from on the part of the @entity36 ? some lawmakers point to a controversial photo spread in @entity55 back in 2010 , featuring a girl as young as 10 in high heels and sexy makeup			1
toddler does @entity60 : where 's the line between dress - up , hyper - sexualization ? the pageants are sexualizing our young girls , said lawmakers in @entity36 , and judging by the response to our request for comment on @entity0 's @entity76 page , many people in the @entity69 agree			1
" how pleased i am that , finally , some are fully awakened and realizing that child beauty pageants should be banned , " said @entity77 of @entity78 , @entity79 , in an e-mail message			1
" the mothers are the culprits here : teaching your child to be sexy and alluring at such a young , tender age when they are not ready for such exploitation			1
" @entity89 , also via e-mail , said , " it is not about living vicariously through your child			2
it 's about letting your child 's childhood and youth get stolen by makeup , fashion shows , heels and dresses			2
" " to paint makeup on their faces and do up their hair , etc. , @entity102 , wake up people , " said @entity101			0
" these are children for heaven 's sake , not adults			0
let them decide for themselves at an appropriate age if they want to pursue this when they are adults			0
" psychologist @entity118 said the danger here is normalizing behavior that once would have been considered extreme and weird			0
" and now it seems perfectly ok for a little 6 - year - old to be walking around in thigh - high boots and short booty shorts and smacking her butt when she dances down a runway ? come on ! that 's what a stripper does			0
" others expressed fears about who may be watching these pageants			0
" every time i think about child beauty pageants , my heart sinks at the thought of all the pedophiles watching them			1
why in the world do children need to be so sexualized ? " asked a @entity0 reader			0
opinion : ' @entity24 ' and sexualizing 3 - year - olds on the other side are moms like @entity149 of @entity150 , @entity151 , who said her 13 - year - old daughter @entity152 was so shy she could n't even order for herself at a restaurant			0
after she started appearing in " natural " pageants ( no makeup allowed ) , she blossomed			0
and now , as " miss @entity156 , " she speaks to young girls across the country about her experiences with bullying , something she encountered when girls were jealous of her success on the pageant circuit			1
" she 's a role model to many and her confidence to stand up and speak out came from her improved self - esteem through pageantry , " said @entity166 , who says @entity152 can out interview and speak more confidently than most adults			1
" these are skills that will benefit her for a lifetime ... just as they did for me growing up in pageantry			2
" @entity179 , director of @entity180 located in @entity181 , is also strongly against banning pageants for young girls and boys			1
she said just because some pageant systems " push it too far " ( hers , she said , does not allow " fake hair , fake tans , fake teeth or a lot of makeup " ) , they most definitely should not be outlawed			2
" society is too quick to judge something they are not familiar with , " said @entity179			0
" a pageant ( run ) properly is no different than a young girl competing in gymnastics , a school function or anything else that has a score kept or judged upon			2
teach these girls to be strong , confident individuals and see how far they go in life			0
" ' six - year - old @entity69 beauty queen draws protests and $ 77,000 payday @entity208 of @entity209 appeared in school pageants beginning in the sixth grade and competed in the @entity213 pageant , which is part of the @entity216 program			1
she does not believe in a legal ban			0
" it 's not a government issue , " said @entity208			0
" it 's a social issue and it 's a family issue			0
" she believes the pageant bodies should get together and create a new rule only allowing girls to enter when they are at an age when they can choose what they want to do for themselves , around 9 , 10 or 11			2
countdown for @entity228 turning 18 : gross or fair game ? " i do not like it when children who are not able to make choices on their own are forced to be in pageants and that is when i see the over-glamourization of young girls , " said @entity208 , who is a media coordinator and writer for @entity0 's food blog , @entity232			1
" they do n't even look like children anymore			0
" @entity242 , a former school principal , is no fan of child pageants , but like @entity244 , thinks government should not be deciding what programs are acceptable for children			2
" i think outlawing them is a slippery slope where the government starts dictating what activities parents can or can not make available to children , " said @entity248			0
" i do believe we could set guidelines on what does and does not constitute promoting sexual exploitation of children as far as routines and dress			0
" i always try to approach these stories , as a mom of two young girls , with the question of what would i do ? in this case , how would i feel if my girls wanted to enter a pageant ? adult - inspired lingerie marketed for young girls full disclosure here : i did compete in the @entity276 miss @entity274 pageant in high school , but let me stress it was not a beauty pageant but a pageant based on talent , interviewing skills and community service			1
it was a terrific experience for me , and as many other women said earlier , it only added to my self - esteem , confidence and fire to achieve my dreams			1
so back to the question , what if my girls , ages 5 and 7 , wanted to be in a pageant ? i think i agree with the sentiment that they can do what they want when they are old enough to make that decision for themselves , which means i do n't have to worry about this one			2
