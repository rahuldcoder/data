-- my great - grandmother used to laugh in moments of misfortune and confusion			0
it was a reflex honed by the constant daily pressures of being an immigrant in a country where the language and the culture were alien			0
years later , she said it was a form of stress release			0
but thinking back , i can also see how laughter felt like the safest bet when confronted with threatening situations in an unfamiliar world			0
so , maybe genetics explain my inappropriate hilarity when i heard that the @entity21 killed the @entity22 this week -- or at least stood by and did nothing while it died			1
the bill has been almost automatically extended every five years since its initial passage in 1994			0
this trend came to a sickening halt this week when the @entity28 sought to extend critical protections to immigrant and @entity31 women , as well as @entity34 people			1
the current political climate that allows for this betrayal of the fundamental right to safety of body and being feels as alien to me as early 20th - century @entity41 must have felt to my @entity43 great - grandma			1
drafted in the mid- ' 90s by then - sen. @entity44 , @entity22 provided greater authority to investigate and prosecute domestic violence cases			1
it also beefed up scant funding to support victims			0
before @entity22 , women saw little incentive and an ominous downside to reporting abuse			1
more often than not , their abusers saw no punishment , but victims faced losing jobs , homes , marriages and custody of their children			0
offer women a safe way out of a terrible situation , however , and the results are impressive			2
reports of gender - based violence dropped a remarkable 64 % from 1993 to 2010 -- from 2.1 million reported cases to 907,000 reported cases			0
even better , the more robust reporting incentives and mechanisms illuminated societal blind spots where abuse still occurs			2
that led the @entity28 to pass an expanded version of the reauthorized bill -- one that extends protections to populations that remain vulnerable			1
the bill was drafted jointly by sen. @entity80 , @entity81 , and sen. @entity82 , @entity83 , and passed the @entity28 by a comfortable margin last @entity85			0
the need is clear : a full third of @entity31 women will be raped in their lifetimes ; an even higher number will experience physical and emotional abuse			1
lesbian and gay people will be brutalized at the same rate as general society -- approximately 27 % -- but will have far bleaker prospects of finding help			2
some 45 % of those seeking refuge at a shelter were turned away , and 55 % who sought restraining orders against abusers were denied			0
undocumented women in the @entity106 risk being held hostage by abusive spouses who lord citizenship over them as a means of control			2
these same husbands often threaten deportation and separation from children if their wives seek help or report abuse			2
opinion : @entity21 @entity120 failed women on @entity22 meanwhile , 80 % of migrant workers who work in @entity106 agriculture report sexual harassment ; many of those include rape			1
the crisis is so endemic in those industries that the workers often refer to their workplace as " @entity132 " or " field of panties			0
" the reforms in the @entity28 bill that seek to right these devastating and rampant wrongs are modest and simple : tribal authorities can prosecute offenses on reservations when state and federal prosecutors fail to do so , the government can issue a visa to abuse victims to halt deportation if they agree to testify against their abusers and shelters that receive federal grants are prohibited from discriminating against @entity34 abuse victims who seek their services			1
these reforms seem like no - brainers in the face of so many brutalized women			2
but not to a @entity21 @entity120 caucus that is scoring political points off the pain of people reviled by the extreme @entity120 base			1
it seems that sanctioning an underclass of women who live in fear is a small price to pay for approval ratings at home			2
even worse , at least one @entity120 supporter actually profited from killing the bill			1
@entity170 is the owner of a mail - order bride company successfully sued by a bride who had been continuously beaten by her husband			0
she is also a top official on the advocacy group @entity175 and @entity176 , or @entity177 , which , according to a report in the @entity179 , lobbied the " @entity21 to include a ' reform to curb @entity22 immigration fraud ' in its version of the bill			1
" more protections for these immigrant women would cost @entity187 's company a lot of money			1
these are among the folks with whom the @entity120 has cast its lot			1
in the past couple of months , @entity106 lent their voices to the global chorus of horror as a young @entity198 woman died from internal injuries after being gang raped , and we shook our collective heads self - righteously when a @entity204 girl was shot by the @entity205 simply for wanting an education			0
perhaps keeping our eyes on the horizon distracts us from having to face the unchecked bigotry in our own @entity210			0
but the result today is millions of ignored and vulnerable women within our own borders			2
aside from the moral repugnance of this , the actions of this minority make our great nation a hypocrite in the eyes of so many around the world who have looked to us to be beacons of democracy and equal rights			0
and that 's not a laughing matter , no matter how alien that makes me feel in my own home country			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			1

@entity233 : the @entity21 @entity120 killing @entity22 is betrayal of women 's right to safety
she says it extends critical protections for @entity34 people , immigrants , @entity31
she says @entity21 @entity120 scoring political points off pain of those reviled by extreme @entity120 base
@entity233 : we decry rape , abuse in other lands , and these distract us from abuses in our own
