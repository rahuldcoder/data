@entity0 , @entity1 -- shortly after her birth , @entity3 was taken away from her mother and sent to a laboratory for a life of medical testing			1
like the 265 other chimpanzees at the @entity11 's facility in @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity3 would be poked and prodded in the name of medical research			1
@entity3 was one of the lucky ones : she survived			0
others were not so fortunate			0
three chimpanzees housed at the @entity11 were literally cooked to death when their enclosures heated to 140 degrees @entity19			1
when federal authorities found out about the facility 's mistreatment of these animals , it lost its funding and went bankrupt			1
that 's when a team of animal welfare experts stepped in and changed these chimpanzees ' lives forever			1
with the help of a $ 3.7 million grant , the @entity32 organization purchased the facility in 2002 and transformed it into the world 's largest sanctuary for chimpanzees			1
it would serve as temporary housing for the chimps until the organization could create a more permanent outdoor sanctuary in @entity43			1
but first , @entity3 and the others -- isolated for most of their lives -- would have to learn how to live as family units			0
and that process would take nearly a decade of rehabilitation			2
learning to become chimps again one of the first priorities in rehabilitating the chimps was modifying their cages , known by the @entity32 team as " the dungeon			1
" this gray , concrete structure housed 54 chimpanzees , most of them crammed into small , individual cages			2
the cages where the rest of the chimpanzees were housed were n't much bigger but they shared the space with another animal or two			1
" it was six months of cutting doors into six - inch thick concrete walls so that chimps could actually see each other for the first time and meet each other for the first time , " said save the @entity32 sanctuary director @entity66			1
even with the new doors and skylights , the dungeon still had a dark feel to it , and resembled a concrete block of prison cells			0
once the buildings were modified , the care of the animals became routine and the team began to slowly create diverse family groups for the chimps			2
" the ultimate goal was forming family groups of 20 to 25 chimpanzees , " explained @entity66 , " we did it by introducing one chimpanzee at a time , so we 're talking over the past 10 years thousands of thousands of introductions			1
" meet one of the oldest chimpanzees in captivity for @entity3 and many of the other chimps , this was a completely new experience			1
@entity3 would rock back and forth and often scream for no apparent reason			0
she was pale , balding and anxious when @entity32 took over the facility			0
moesha was immediately introduced to another chimpanzee , @entity105 , and soon after bonding with her , @entity3 was introduced into a chimpanzee family			0
her hair has since thickened and her skin darkened from the sunlight that peeked through the bars in her newly improved cage			0
@entity66 said it took a while for the chimpanzees to get used to each other			2
some groups took up to a year to form			0
" when a family was ready and an island was ready , then we would migrate a group to @entity43 , " she said			1
" @entity123 groups were formed and migrated over a period of six years			0
we started doing large scale migrations in 2005 , 2006			0
" chimpanzees as medical test subjects the @entity128 is one of two remaining countries -- the other being @entity131 -- that legally allow chimps and other great apes to be used in invasive biomedical research , according to the @entity135			1
however , other countries still contract the services of research centers that use chimps , according to dr. @entity140 of the @entity141 in @entity142			1
there are more than 930 chimpanzees at @entity128 medical research facilities , most of them used for hepatitis testing , according to a report by the @entity150 issued in december			1
the report stated that chimpanzees are not necessary for most biomedical research			1
the institute recognized two possible uses for chimps : one for cancerous tumors that are already part of ongoing investigations , and the other for a hepatitis c vaccine			2
a panel of experts advising the @entity164 on how to implement the the @entity150 's report is expected to issue its recommendations by the end of the year			2
read more about the @entity150 report a bill that would end invasive research on chimps and other great apes has been before @entity173 since 2008 , reintroduced in subsequent years , most recently as the the " @entity175 and @entity174 of 2011			1
" a @entity177 subcommittee has the bill on its agenda for tuesday			0
@entity180 began using chimpanzees for toxicology tests in the 1940s at @entity184 in @entity0 , @entity1			2
@entity180 , who died in 2003 at age 89 , helped develop hepatitis vaccines and spent years working on a vaccine for @entity188 , according to his obituary in the @entity190			2
but the use of chimpanzees in his research made him a target of animal welfare advocates			1
in 1993 , he established the @entity11 in @entity0 -- considered the largest chimpanzee laboratory in the world -- where he carried out his research on chimps and loaned them out to other laboratories , with the help of government funding			1
the facility was cited numerous times for violating the @entity206 and federal funding was withdrawn , forcing it to close in 2002			2
that year , @entity180 reached out to save the @entity32 founder dr. @entity208 , offering to sell the laboratory and donate all 266 chimpanzees to the organization , according to @entity32			1
nine years later , the chimps were ready to move from the former laboratory to the outdoor sanctuary in @entity43			1
getting ready for the journey peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are handed out to @entity3 and her family as they get ready for the 2,000 - mile cross-country journey			0
moesha is one of the final 10 chimps heading to the sanctuary in @entity223 : 150 acres of former orange groves , transformed into islands where the chimpanzees will be permanently retired			1
the islands keep the chimpanzees , who are afraid of water , on the property without the need for fencing			2
it will be their first time living outdoors			1
before the specially designed trailer carrying the final 10 chimps departs @entity1 , tears fill the eyes of the @entity32 staff as they say goodbye			2
the chimps are wheeled onto the trailer in small , single cages near the members of their family units			2
each chimpanzee has a window seat			0
it is after dark when @entity105 , the last chimpanzee , is loaded into the trailer			0
she is placed next to @entity3 and across from @entity250			0
as the staff takes pictures and says their goodbyes , high - pitched hoots and screams can be heard outside the trailer , which the chimpanzees aggressively rock			2
this behavior is barely noticed ; it is no different from the past 26 times workers have loaded a group of chimpanzees destined for @entity43			1
but this trip is different and @entity66 's thoughts are on the @entity32 founder , who passed away before the " @entity265 " could come to a happy end			2
" i wish @entity208 was here			0
all this was her project			0
this was her dream , " @entity66 said			0
as the truck pulling the trailer slowly drives out of the gate , a crowd of former and current employees gives a loud cheer			0
the last of the @entity280 chimpanzees is heading for a new life far away from the former research facility			1
back to nature the 2,000 - mile road trip will take a day and a half , because of frequent stops to check on the chimpanzees			0
they are fed fruits and juice and medicine is administered			0
@entity3 , @entity105 and @entity292 are on birth control pills and @entity294 , @entity105 and @entity295 are given medicine for anxiety			0
when the trailer arrives in @entity223 , @entity43 , the chimps are greeted by a cheering crowd of workers and volunteers			1
after being reunited with the other nine members of their family that arrived ahead of them , @entity3 and her traveling companions are let out onto the island			0
it 's the first time these chimpanzees have felt grass under their feet and direct sunlight on their skin			1
@entity66 recalls how far @entity3 has progressed over the past decade			0
" moesha is amazing , " said @entity66 , with the emotion of a proud mother			0
" when she first came , she was the most scared , timid chimp			0
" showing no fear of her new surroundings , @entity3 --- unlike her other family members -- confidently walks across the grass to the middle of the island			0
there she sat for a few minutes , taking in her new green surroundings , soaking up the kind of life she never knew existed .			0

save the @entity329 spent nearly a decade rehabilitating chimps from the @entity11
the 266 chimps were used as medical research test subjects until 2002
the animal welfare group recently transported the chimps to a sanctuary in @entity43
it 's the first time these chimpanzees have lived outdoors
