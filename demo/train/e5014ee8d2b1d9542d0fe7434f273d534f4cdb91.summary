-- it was the very first race of this year 's @entity2 and @entity3 was confident of wresting back her @entity5 title			1
just five seconds in , the story went off script , and @entity8 off course			2
on the @entity15 slopes on an arctic @entity16 february afternoon , the @entity12 downhill @entity11 champion 's first jump on the course initially appeared to go to plan but , as she landed , her weight seemed to shift too far forward and her right knee buckled virtually to a right angle beneath her			1
she skidded off the track and came to a rest 100 meters down the mountain , in a crumpled wreck in the snow , clutching her knee , her face twisted in agony before the rescue helicopter winched her up over the snow - dusted pine trees below , taking her to begin the slow and agonizing recovery process			1
she has been open in that recovery process , tweeting pictures of the horrific state of her blackened and swollen knee in the aftermath of her operation , keeping her followers posted on the slow and steady nature of her recovery			2
less than seven months later in september , @entity8 clipped back into her skis on the slopes of @entity41 , @entity42 , to test the reconstructed knee , insisting " i ca n't tell which knee is injured " and that she was " skiing without fear			2
" her plan is now to return to competitive skiing at the @entity50 meeting in @entity51 , @entity52 , from 29 november to 1 december			1
the @entity60 , their physician dr @entity53 , who performed surgery on @entity56 , and @entity57 at @entity58 , headed by @entity59 , have been at the heart of her recovery program			1
the comeback goal has been all about the @entity65 in @entity66 in february 2014 , one year after the injury			1
" @entity3 is a fighter and having her goal always in mind , she did everything needed for her comeback , " @entity67 told @entity0			1
" she has mastered it outstandingly and she always knew that she could n't do too much too early			2
" but such a tremendous injury requires a very specific and well - co - ordinated rehab program			1
the @entity60 , dr @entity53 and we at @entity58 did everything possible to create an ideal rehab environment for @entity3			1
" early in that recovery process , @entity58 published a picture of @entity8 , her knee heavily strapped on a medical bed doing exercises with the caption " not letting obstacles stand in her way			1
" her program involved a strict calendar of rehab measurements and physical training but the physical side of things was only half of the battle			1
returning to the slopes after crashing at high speed and with a potentially career - threatening injury can take some overcoming			1
" the physical rebuild is absolutely essentially but it has to go in coordination with the rehab program , " continued @entity67			1
" for sure there is a mental aspect too , returning to the slopes can be a challenge			1
" but when i saw @entity3 giving her comeback on skis in @entity42 , it was totally obvious that everything is totally fine			1
skiing is her element and she was all smiles to be finally back on skis			0
" for all the positive noises from @entity8 's camp , however , there is still a sense -- to a certain degree -- that she is skiing into the unknown in the ensuing weeks			1
" we are on target and everything looks good now , " added @entity67			0
" however , i can not read the future and returning to the peak depends on loads of different aspects			0
" for the superstar of world skiing , it is her first career - threatening injury			1
so just how does skier recover from those physical and mental wounds ? perhaps there is no better person to ask than @entity140 skier @entity139 , who is in the midst of rehab from breaking her leg for the third time			1
the first and most serious break dates back to december 2010 during a practice run at @entity147 in @entity148			0
it was a jump she had tackled 60 times , 59 of them correctly but this time things went awry ... at 80mph			0
on this occasion , she ended up with a multitude of fractured bones in her leg , she was strapped to a stretcher and attached to a helicopter			2
the breaks were so severe that her ski boot liner became lodged inside her leg , the removed boot showing smashed bones and a torrent of blood as it was removed			1
it was an injury that kept her out of competitive action for two years but amazingly she remained conscious throughout			2
" well , for one , i do n't remember the crash , " said @entity139 , who similarly has opted not to watch it back			1
" i think that was my body 's defense mechanism , to shut it out			2
" i 'm a very optimistic person and i do n't need to see something that could be negative			0
there 's nothing to be gained from reliving it			2
" remarkably @entity139 opted to make her return at @entity147 of all places , which had nearly seen the end of her career , finishing an impressive 25th in the downhill against the world 's best skiers			1
she describes that run as " the gutsiest performance of her life			0
" clearly the mental demons were in abundance , perhaps typified by the fact that rather than her customary 10 minutes preparing at the start gate , she opted to spend just half - a - minute there			1
come the run itself , though , she explained : " i really put my brain out the window			0
i came out of the gate with a sense of peace and satisfaction having made it back			0
" she did not on that occasion nor during her latest break see a sports psychologist			1
" if i felt i had a weakness , i 'd see someone about it , " she said			0
instead , she talked it through with other skiers who have endured similar experiences before adding , " i think i 'm mentally strong enough			0
with that @entity147 run , i 've proved how tough i can be			0
" i did n't let anything in from the past , i was n't scared , i was just excited to be back			0
i just do n't think of ' what ifs ' i just get on with things			0
" for me , my only thought is @entity66			0
i 've worked so hard for it			0
it 's got to be			2
" " @entity66 doubt ? " she added , somewhat flabbergasted , in answer to the question of whether she would ok for the @entity65			0
" it 's just not there , i ca n't let it creep in			2
it 's my @entity229 ending			2
" there is something even more @entity229 about @entity8 , with her higher profile and her on - going relationship with the world 's most famous golfer @entity234			1
both skiers , though , have very similar goals , to make it to @entity66			0
but what is it about skiers that enable them to overcome such mental battles			2
is it genetic ? dr @entity246 manages the @entity247 at @entity248 and is a chartered sport and exercise psychologist whose research centers on personality , motivation , risk and reaction times especially in examining the psychology of extreme sport			1
" we are all born with a genetic pattern and obviously a genetic predisposition towards certain behavior , " says @entity246			0
" when you are born with more of an anxiety trait your natural reaction would be to get anxious in a stressful situation such as a broken leg			2
" however , both @entity3 and @entity139 have developed excellent coping mechanisms , pushing aside thoughts of perhaps not ever being able to be the best in your sport			1
" but even extreme sports starts come to a point after an injury where they think enough is enough			1
as @entity246 pointed out : " some skiers do give up			0
i have often found the length of their career as part of an odds game -- the longer they compete or engage in the sport , the greater the chance of something serious happening			2
" that happened in the case of @entity16 skier @entity287 , a @entity50 winner who suffered a serious head injury in a fall in 2011			1
at the age of 30 , @entity287 made a full recovery from those head injuries but any hopes of a return to the slopes -- at least competitively -- were curtailed by nerve damage to his right leg			1
he had suffered two serious falls before , much like @entity139 and @entity8 , and on both occasions opted to return			1
" to me , that was not a problem , crashing is a part of skiing , and crashing never gave me fear for the next time , " he explained			0
" but this accident was different			0
i could n't come back			0
" his comments suggest he would still be competing if given the chance but @entity287 is not so sure			0
" i do n't know as i just feel happy to have my life , " he adds			0
" i was told if my head injury was one centimeter to the right or left , things could have been very different			2
" perhaps fortunately the mental demons of the crash do not haunt him -- he has no memory from six weeks beforehand to about six weeks afterwards			2
however , before returning to the slopes in a more amateur fashion , he opted to watch back his horror fall			0
" it was just me and my laptop , " he recalls			0
" it took me a time to press play -- my finger was hovering over play for a long time			0
but when i watched it , it was ok			0
it was just like watching someone else			0
so when i did first ski , i was not scared			0
" unlike @entity287 , in retirement from the age of 30 , @entity8 , who turns 29 on friday , and 31 - year - old @entity139 have opted to return			1
despite their crashes , they show no signs of slowing down or hanging up their skis .			0
