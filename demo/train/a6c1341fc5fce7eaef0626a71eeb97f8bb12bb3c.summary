@entity0 -- aircraft will soon shoot high - resolution photos of the @entity4 , @entity0 , beach area where the search for a missing woman has led to the remains of at least eight people			1
airplanes and helicopters will begin circling the barrier island beach later this week as federal , state and local search efforts continue , @entity10 police commissioner @entity9 told reporters on wednesday			1
" the high - resolution technology should be able to provide a detailed representation of the area and will extend through @entity20 , " @entity9 said			2
" we 're hoping the technology will help identify skeletal remains that may still be out there			1
" the aerial imagery will supplement police - dog search units , which expected to resume searching later this week			1
meanwhile , diver teams are already scouring the waterways on the north side of the barrier island			0
eight different sets of confirmed human remains have been found in @entity10 , @entity4 , since december , in what police say could be the work of a serial killer or killers			1
additional remains -- including a human skull -- were uncovered monday			1
police have not said whether the latest remains are from different people , or if they could have come from the eight victims			1
some of the remains found monday in a @entity20 wildlife preserve were wrapped in a " black plastic product " similar to a plastic bag , a law enforcement source said wednesday			1
the remains " appeared to be part of a lower extremity , " the source said			1
medical examiner investigators are trying to determine the age and sex of the remains and attempt to find out how long they were at the location before being discovered			1
federal agents first joined police in their investigation in december , after four bodies had been found			1
that discovery on a quarter - mile stretch of @entity64 indicates that " they were dumped there by the same person or persons , " @entity9 told reporters at the time			0
" it 's too coincidental that there were four bodies in the same location			0
" they were all found stuffed in bushes along an isolated strip of waterfront property			2
the grisly find occurred as police searched for 24 - year - old @entity80 , who was last seen alive in may 2010 in the @entity82 area			2
@entity84 's sisters said @entity80 was an escort who was visiting a client			0
they said she ran from the man 's house and called 911 , claiming that someone was trying to hurt her			0
in a strange series of events , a local resident -- who lives a few miles from where the remains were found -- said a young woman who " looked like she was partying all night " came to his door at about 5 a.m. on may 1			1
" she was screaming ' help me , help me ! ' and said somebody was chasing her , " said @entity100 , who lives in the town of @entity64			0
he described the woman as a " young , light - brown - haired person in her early 20s			0
" @entity100 said he called 911 after opening his front door to the woman , prompting her to flee into the weeds along an embankment near his house			0
moments later , @entity100 said an " @entity113 - looking man " man driving a dark - colored sport utility vehicle pulled up alongside his home , looking for the woman			0
" things got out of hand at a party and i 'm just looking for her , " @entity100 quoted the man as saying			0
when @entity100 told the man that he had called police , the man said he " should not have done that " and drove toward where girl had fled , @entity100 said			2
but he says it took police more than four months to question him about the incident , potentially losing crucial evidence over that time frame			1
@entity100 later told @entity1 that he believes the woman he saw that night was @entity84			0
@entity1 can not independently verify that claim			0
@entity9 said wednesday that he has " no idea when the detective spoke to whomever you 're talking about , " referencing @entity100			0
police said they received a written statement from @entity100 in june			2
@entity84 's body has not been among the remains identified			2
@entity1 's @entity140 and @entity141 contributed to this report			0

8 sets of confirmed human remains have been found in @entity10
more remains and a skull were found monday
police have not confirmed that the newly found remains were of different people
@entity154 says it took police more than four months to question him as a potential witness
