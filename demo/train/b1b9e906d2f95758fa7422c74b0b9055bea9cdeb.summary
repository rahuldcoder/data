@entity0 -- in 1980 , @entity2 was sitting in a @entity4 prison cell , serving a life sentence			1
on the other side of the world , a young college student named @entity7 was riveted by the anti-apartheid movement in @entity4 and the brewing crusade to free the renowned activist			1
little did they know that nearly three decades later , the two would have something in common : they would be the first elected black presidents in their respective countries			0
@entity17 president @entity7 has made it no secret that he considers @entity2 one of the greatest influences -- if not the greatest -- in his life and in the lives of countless others			1
throughout his first five years in office , he has repeatedly referenced @entity2 , either invoking quotes from the anti-apartheid icon or spreading his messages of freedom and equality			2
" we have lost one of the most influential , courageous , and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this earth , " the president said thursday while marking @entity2 's death			2
" he no longer belongs to us -- he belongs to the ages			0
" left and right use @entity2 's death as opportunity to bash their favorite bogeymen answering a ' call ' at @entity45 in @entity46 around 1980 , @entity7 first forayed into political activism â € ” a protest against apartheid			1
it was the beginning of what would become years of studying @entity2 's speeches and writings			2
" in the most modest of ways , i was one of those people who tried to answer his call , " he wrote in the forward to @entity2 's 2010 memoir " @entity55			2
" @entity7 has acknowledged that none of the obstacles he faced growing up compared to those of the victims in @entity4 , but @entity2 's " example helped awaken ( @entity7 ) to the wider world , " he wrote in the forward			1
" through his choices , @entity2 made it clear that we did not have to accept the world as it is -- that we could do our part to seek the world as it should be , " he added			2
in his own book , " @entity72 , " @entity7 recalls giving his first public speech , in which he made a plea for the trustees at @entity45 to divest from @entity4			1
" i really wanted to stay up there , to hear my voice bouncing off the crowd and returning back to me in applause			0
" following his involvement with the demonstrations , @entity7 began pursuing his interests in public policy , transferring to @entity84 where he dug deep into books and courses about race and social justice			2
after graduation , he became a community organizer in @entity91			0
making history when @entity2 was released from prison in 1990 , @entity7 was well into law school at @entity95 and getting ready to start the next phase of his career			1
@entity2 's funeral , farewell plans : a day by day breakdown that same month , @entity7 made history of his own â € ” though on a much smaller scale			1
he became the first @entity4 - @entity17 president of the @entity105 , a story big enough to elicit a headline in the @entity108			0
in his interview with the @entity108 , @entity7 said , '' i personally am interested in pushing a strong minority perspective			0
i 'm fairly opinionated about this , " he said			0
" but as president of the law review , i have a limited role as only first among equals			0
'' four years after graduating law school , and not long after @entity2 won a @entity118 and was elected president , @entity7 published " @entity72 " in 1995			1
in the memoir , he lumped @entity2 in with a group of men whose attributes @entity7 aspired to emulate			1
" it was into my father 's image , a black man , son of @entity4 , that i 'd packed all the attributes i sought in myself , the attributes of @entity130 and @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity2 , " he wrote			1
a year later , @entity7 was elected to the @entity133 , a path that would set him on a fast - moving track that landed him a spot on the presidential ballot just 12 years later			0
' a personal hero ' as @entity7 made his way up the political ladder , @entity2 was continuing to spread his influence , campaigning for justice and human rights around the world			1
he did n't seek reelection in 1999 -- keeping his promise to serve only one term -- and he became intimately involved with @entity149 awareness , a disease that killed his son at the age of 55 in 2005			0
@entity7 met @entity2 for the first time in 2005			1
@entity7 , a senator at the time , was riding to a @entity0 event when his office called ; @entity2 was in town and asked to see him			1

@entity7 called @entity2 in 2010 after his great - granddaughter was killed in a car crash			2
while @entity7 considered @entity2 a champion , he frequently noted he was not alone in his views about the icon			2
" he 's a personal hero , but i do n't think i 'm unique in that regard , " he said in @entity169			0
" i think he 's a hero for the world			0
" during his first year in the @entity172 , @entity7 was awarded the @entity118 -- a decision that sparked controversy , considering that his career on the world stage was only at its infancy at that point			2
@entity7 was keenly aware of where he stood in line			0
" compared to some of the giants of the history who 've received this prize , @entity193 and @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity2 , my accomplishments are slight , " he said in his acceptance speech , also paying tribute to those who were suffering in their respective fights for freedom and justice around the world			0
" i can not argue with those who find these men and women -- some known , some obscure to all but those they help -- to be far more deserving of this honor than @entity201 " ' that 's what brings me back here ' on a trip to @entity4 this summer , @entity7 and his family visited @entity2 's cell on @entity209 , a spot @entity7 visited as a senator in 2006			1
but this time , he got to bring his two daughters , @entity213 and @entity214			0
life under apartheid : demeaning , often brutal " for me to be able to bring my daughters there and teach them the history of that place and this country ... that 's a great privilege and a great honor , " @entity7 told students at the @entity218 in june			2
with @entity2 gravely ill , @entity7 did not get to visit him during his trip ; he met with @entity2 's family instead			1
while in @entity4 , @entity7 noted the " outpouring of love " for @entity2 , saying it spoke to " the yearning for justice and dignity that transcends boundaries of race and class and faith and country			1
