-- @entity1 kept his @entity3 title defense alive as he clawed back almost eight minutes in winning saturday 's seventh stage in @entity5			1
the @entity7 driver is still more than 42 minutes behind leader @entity8 in sixth place overall , having lost significant time to the @entity12 's @entity11 in the opening stage of 14 and then on thursday			1
but his surging form in the @entity15 , passing five drivers in the second half of the 419 - kilometer special in and around @entity18 , has given him hope that all is not over going into sunday 's halfway rest day			2
" the car worked perfectly well today and we attacked from the beginning to the end of the special			0
we took a lot of risks to set the best time , " the 41 - year - old said , having lost a stage when friday 's leg from @entity31 in @entity32 was called off due to snow in the @entity34			2
" our objective is to claw back seven or eight minutes every day			0
and today we did it perfectly			0
we will do our best to repeat this performance in all stages from monday onwards , or even try to do better			0
" @entity8 is a @entity39 legend with three car titles and six on motorbikes , all coming before the grueling endurance event moved to @entity44 in 2009 due to security problems in @entity46			2
he has a lead of 11 minutes and 22 seconds over @entity11 teammate @entity48 of @entity49 , who was fifth last year			1
the 46 - year - old was third in saturday 's stage , seven minutes clear of @entity52 and 23 seconds behind @entity15 's @entity54 @entity53			1
@entity53 , an experienced @entity55 driver , is third overall -- 13 minutes off the pace after finishing 7:30 behind his teammate			1
motorbike champion @entity58 moved to within eight minutes of leader @entity60 after shaving 2:03 off the @entity12 's advantage on saturday			1
the @entity62 triumphed in the sand dunes to keep alive his hopes of a fourth title for the @entity67 team			0
" it is common knowledge that the stage before the rest day is always difficult , and today was not an exception , with stifling heat and very soft sand , " @entity58 said			1
" nevertheless , we rode very fast and i was able to attack			0
we know the strategy well , so we are aware that i will probably gain two minutes one day , then @entity60 will gain two minutes the next ... and it is hard to change this when there is but one road			1
" @entity60 , also a three - time winner on bikes , admitted he had lapsed in concentration			2
" i was a bit lazy today , since @entity58 led the race from km 200 onwards , the start of the second special , but i think that is also part of the race			2
so i thank him for this , " he said			0
" there is always a strategic aspect , since we know we can control two - minute gaps			0
having said that , i finished with my hands paralyzed , but it was a really beautiful special with beautiful dunes			0
