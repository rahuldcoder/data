even in their greatest moments of triumph , @entity1 presidents can make decisions that in the long run will devastate their legacies			0
we have seen this in recent times , such as with president @entity12 's decision to invade @entity13			0
but the classic example was @entity16 's experience with @entity17			1
fifty years ago , when the 89th @entity18 convened in january 1965 following @entity16 's landslide election victory against sen. @entity20 , @entity16 was at the height of his political power			1
@entity23 commanded huge majorities in both the @entity25 and @entity26			0
the coalition of southern @entity23 and @entity28 had lost much of their power			0
conservative republicans were marginalized since nobody wanted to look anything like a protégé of @entity20			0
with the backing of a mass civil rights movement and organized labor , the @entity25 was determined to push forward a huge domestic agenda ranging from @entity38 to more anti-poverty programs to voting rights			0
bills would soon be passing at a breathtaking pace as the nation saw @entity44 remake the social contract			0
but in these very same months , @entity16 intensified @entity1 's involvement in the war against communism in @entity17 -- a war that would prove to be disastrous , devastating and arguably the aspect of his presidency that continues to define him more than anything else			1
the previous year @entity16 had already strengthened the nation 's commitment to the conflict in @entity58			1
while president @entity59 had increased the number of advisors working with the @entity62 in the fight against communist forces , @entity16 set the groundwork for a much bigger intervention			1
he did n't do so with great confidence			0
in one of the most revealing @entity25 recordings -- on may 27 , 1964 -- he and @entity71 sen. @entity70 , a southern hawk who was @entity16 's mentor , have a lengthy conversation where both men express their doubts about whether this conflict was essential to the @entity78 and whether it could ever be won			1
@entity70 said that it 's a " damn worse mess that i ever saw			0
" @entity70 added , " i do n't see how we ever going to get out without fighting a major war ...			0
" " i just do n't know what to do , " said @entity16			1
regardless , because of the political pressure that @entity16 felt from @entity28 who were attacking him as weak on defense and since he agreed to the logic of the domino theory -- that if one country fell to communism others would follow -- @entity16 requested that @entity18 authorize the use of force through the @entity91 on august 4 , 1964			1
based on weak evidence about an attack on @entity95 destroyers ( @entity16 admitted that the attack , if it occurred , was a mistake or the result of a decision by a low - level commander ) , @entity16 worked with @entity103 sen. @entity102 to convince @entity23 to support him with this resolution			1
the resolution was " like @entity106 's nightshirt , " @entity16 said of the resolution , " it covers everything			1
" @entity102 assured his colleagues that they needed to pass the resolution to protect @entity16 from @entity28 attack			1
if he intended to actually use his full power to deploy force in the conflict , @entity102 said , he would return to @entity18 for their approval			0
on february 15 , 1965 , @entity16 received encouragement from a former president about how he was handling the situation			1
when @entity16 told him he was " having hell , " including with the situation in @entity17 , president @entity117 assured him it was fine			1
@entity16 thought he could learn from how @entity117 handled his problems with @entity122			1
he reminded @entity117 that as a senator he had sent a letter in support of his efforts in @entity122 , even when @entity28 like @entity129 @entity28 @entity128 were " raising hell " in the @entity26			0
@entity16 said he was " doing the best i can " , that when they " go in and kill your boys you to hit back			1
" @entity117 , who said he was handling the challenges well , gave him support , agreeing that you " bust them in the nose every time you get a chance " and " they understand that language better than any other kind			0
" but as the new year began other @entity23 warned @entity16 that he should not make use of this resolution for force			2
two days after @entity16 spoke with @entity117 , vice president @entity146 implored the president in a lengthy and powerful memorandum to pull out			2
@entity146 argued that , for the first time , @entity16 did n't have to fear @entity28 attacking him as weak on defense			2
liberals controlled @entity18 and he had just won a great landslide electoral victory			0
he could make a bold move and get out of this conflict before it was too late			0
" politically , " @entity146 wrote , the @entity16 administration is in a stronger position to do so than any @entity157 in this history			2
" but @entity16 did n't listen to @entity146 's logic , and still feared the danger of being characterized as weak on defense just like @entity23 had been in 1952 when they lost control of the @entity25 and @entity18			1
as @entity23 in @entity18 spoke out against @entity16 for @entity17 , he became more belligerent			1
he isolated @entity146 from his inner circle of advisors on foreign policy			0
he dismissed the criticism from @entity23 and warned that they were giving propaganda support to the communists			0
we can hear this on a tape with one of @entity16 's greatest allies in the @entity26 , minority leader @entity173			1
on february 17 , 1965 , the two men discussed speeches that had been given by @entity178 sen. @entity177 and @entity180 sen. @entity179			0
@entity173 brought up how the two men had been " teeing off " against @entity16 's @entity62 policy			1
@entity173 thought @entity16 needed some defense from his " friend on the other side of the aisle			2
" @entity16 told @entity173 that former president @entity186 , a @entity28 , fully supported him			2
@entity16 added that the kinds of speeches @entity189 and @entity179 were making posed the " worst problem " to the @entity1 , more so than raids or ambushes or military accidents , since the speeches about the need for negotiation or withdrawal were used by the communists in pamphlets and newspapers			2
the statements undermined the confidence of the @entity62 government that the @entity1 would continue to support them			0
at the same time that he spoke with such great bravado , he admitted to his advisors all of his fears and concerns			0
on february 26 , @entity16 told secretary of defense @entity208 : " i do n't think anything is going to be as bad as losing , and i do n't see any way of winning ...			2
" on march 6 , many months after their haunting conversation about what could likely happen in @entity17 , @entity16 did n't sound much better			1
when explaining that he was preparing to send @entity214 into the conflict , @entity16 they were " getting in worse " and admitted that : " the great trouble i 'm under , a man can fight if he can see daylight down the road somewhere			2
but there ai n't no daylight in @entity17			2
" in response @entity70 said , " there 's no end to the road			0
" during the very month that the @entity25 passed a sweeping version of @entity38 and @entity228 and @entity18 prepared to send him an education bill to sign into law , @entity16 got deeper into one of the most devastating military quagmires that the @entity1 has ever faced			2
@entity16 's fears of being pummeled by the right , combined with his adherence to the " domino theory " about communism , would gradually drive him deeper and deeper into a disastrous war			1
sometimes the very qualities that allow them to make great breakthroughs in public policy , that greatly improve the condition of the country , also allow them to implement decisions that become highly destructive			0

50 years ago the stage was set for decisions that doomed @entity16 's presidency
@entity254 says @entity16 was riding high after 1964 landslide , could have *avoided* @entity17 *escalation*
