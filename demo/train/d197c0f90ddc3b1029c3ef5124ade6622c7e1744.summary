-- so , @entity1 , tell us what you really think			1
in a raw interview with @entity6 , the actor , 56 , railed against @entity8 " dishonesty " and double standards , said that @entity10 and @entity11 have been victims of hypocrisy and asserted that not voting for " @entity14 " to win an @entity15 meant " you were a racist			1
" oh , and he does n't like the @entity18 , helicopter parents or reality tv , either			2
indeed , the " @entity23 " actor , who 's starring in the forthcoming " @entity22 , " pulled no punches when talking about pretty much anything			2
the conversation will appear in the magazine 's july / august issue			2
the @entity10 and @entity11 affairs really angered him , he said , because he believes their accusers do n't exactly have clean hands themselves			1
" i do n't know about @entity10			1
he got drunk and said a few things , but we 've all said those things			2
we 're all f * * * ing hypocrites , " @entity1 said			1
" the policeman who arrested him has never used the word ' n * * * * * ' or ' that f * * * ing jew ' ? i 'm being brutally honest here			2
it 's the hypocrisy of it that drives me crazy			1
" @entity10 is in a town that 's run by @entity45 and he said the wrong thing because he 's actually bitten the hand that i guess has fed him -- and does n't need to feed him anymore because he 's got enough dough , " @entity1 continued			1
" but some @entity45 guy in his office somewhere has n't turned and said , ' that f * * * ing kraut ' or ' f * * * those @entity53 , ' whatever it is ? we all hide and try to be so politically correct			0
that 's what gets me			0
it 's just the sheer hypocrisy of everyone			2
" other @entity1 tidbits : on reality tv : " the museum of social decay			1
" on helicopter parents : " there 's never any unsupervised play to develop skills or learn about hierarchy in a group or how to share			0
the kids honestly believe they are the center of the f * * * ing universe			0
but then they get out into the real world and it 's like , 's * * t , maybe it 's not all about me , ' and that leads to narcissism , depression and anxiety			0
" on political correctness at the @entity15 : " at the @entity15 , if you did n't vote for ' @entity14 ' you were a racist			1
" on the @entity18 : " a meaningless event			0
... it 's 90 nobodies having a wank			0
" if @entity1 is hard on @entity8 and its people , he 's equally critical of himself			1
asked about " @entity88 , " his breakthrough film , he said , " i do n't like myself in the movie			0
" ditto with " @entity92 " and " @entity23			0
" " it was work , " he said			0
( he did have kind things to say about the film " @entity100 , " @entity97 and " @entity98 " director @entity99			0
) as the interview continued , @entity1 -- who described his politics as " libertarian " -- recognized that he may have been a little too blunt			1
" so this interview has gone very badly			2
you have to edit and cut half of what i 've said , because it 's going to make me sound like a bigot , " he said at one point " you 're not a bigot ? " replied interviewer @entity109			0
" no , but i 'm defending all the wrong people , " @entity1 said			1
" i 'm saying @entity10 's all right			1
@entity11 's a good guy			1
so how do i come across ? angry ? " " @entity113 , certainly , " @entity109 said			0
" readers will have to form their own opinions			0
" " it 's dishonesty that frustrates me most , " @entity1 said			1
" i ca n't bear double standards			0
it gets under my skin more than anything			0
