@entity0 -- in one of the largest single - day operations against the @entity7 in @entity9 history , federal agents working with local law enforcement fanned out across @entity10 , @entity0 , @entity11 and @entity12 to arrest 127 people allegedly involved in organized crime , officials said			1
alleged members from the five prominent @entity0 families -- the @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity23 families -- were arrested thursday , based on 16 indictments in four different jurisdictions , attorney general @entity15 said during a news conference in @entity0			1
" today 's arrests and charges mark an important step forward in disrupting @entity7 's illegal activities , " he said , referring to the criminal organization by its @entity10 name			1
ninety - one members and their associates , including one in @entity10 , were charged with federal crimes that include conspiracy , arson , extortion , narcotics trafficking , illegal gambling , labor racketeering and murders that date back as far as 1981 , according to a @entity45 @entity44 statement			1
an additional 36 suspects were charged for their roles in the alleged criminal activity , the statement said			1
about 125 people , including several high - ranking members and much of the @entity19 family leadership , are currently in custody following a raid that @entity15 described as the largest single - day operation against the notorious crime network			1
four of those charged were previously in custody , officials said			1
members of the @entity62 @entity61 family and @entity11 - based @entity64 family are also accused of related federal crimes			1
" some allegations involve classic mob hits to eliminate perceived rivals , " @entity15 told reporters			2
" others involve senseless murders			0
" he described two murder victims who were allegedly killed in a public bar over a dispute concerning a spilled drink			0
@entity15 's appearance in @entity0 with leadership from local and federal law enforcement perhaps underscores the significance the @entity44 attributes to thursday 's sweep			1
television images showed several men handcuffed and hand - checked by federal agents -- an apparent part of the " unprecedented " 800 - person task force involved in the raid			1
the move comes amid concerns about a possible resurgence of organized crime despite a scattered recent history of defections , beginning with acting crime boss of the @entity23 , @entity94 , who admitted to " cooperating with the federal government " starting in 1991			2
gambino family underboss @entity97 defected later that same year , providing testimony -- in exchange for a reduced sentence -- which led to the conviction of the infamous @entity18 kingpin @entity102			0
" if you look at the mob in the ' 50s and ' 60s and ' 70s , there were virtually no informants , " said @entity104 commissioner @entity103			0
" the picture has changed dramatically today			0
the mob is practically unrecognizable			0
" but thursday 's sweep may now do away with " the myth " of the mafia and the widely held notion that " @entity7 is a shell of its former self , " said @entity117 , assistant director in charge of the @entity9 's @entity119			0
" i think we made a serious dent today , " @entity117 said , but she warned of a new generation of criminal leadership " coming up behind them			2
" the mob revival concept , however , is the subject of debate			0
" their leadership ranks have been battered by federal and local law enforcement over the years , " said @entity129 , a professor at the @entity130			2
" it 's very hard to see to how they could have ever reconstituted in the way they were before			0
" attorney general @entity15 said organized crime is not resurgent and no longer nationwide , but still subtracts millions of dollars from local businesses by way of a " mob tax , " or tribute exacted through corrupt local officials			1
@entity15 described the phenomenon as " a major threat to the economic well - being of this country			0
" on thursday , @entity11 and @entity0 prosecutors identified more than a dozen @entity11 residents with alleged mob ties who worked as officials for longshoremen 's unions , charging them with racketeering and other related offenses , according to a joint statement from district attorneys in both states			1
a man described as a " soldier in the @entity165 organized crime family " allegedly collected money from port workers , extorting payments after the workers received their annual @entity171 bonuses			0
police say workers from the @entity174 , local 1235 , were forced to pay corrupt officials between $ 500 and $ 5,000 each year if they hoped to rise above entry - level dock jobs , according to @entity0 police commissioner @entity177			2
" organized crime means what it has always meant on the waterfront : mobsters getting rich on the backs of dock workers , " he said			0
despite declines in mob activity in other industries , dockyards in the @entity186 are places where organized crime remains a threat , according to @entity193			2
and with law enforcement focused on preventing terrorism and providing port security , organized crime is often left without the " day - to - day pressures " it may have felt in years past , he said			0
last april , 14 members of the @entity18 crime family -- including @entity202 , who was then considered the family head -- pleaded guilty to charges that included murder , racketeering , extortion and prostitution of minors , court officials said			1
@entity1 's @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213 contributed to this report .			0
