-- over the past few days we 've heard a lot of criticism directed at the @entity4 after the arrest of a @entity7 player on an intoxication manslaughter charge			1
and justifiably so : a 25 - year - old father - to - be who was riding in the player 's car is dead			1
but we ca n't fall into the trap of making this conversation all about the @entity4 or even professional athletes			1
doing that is a cop - out			0
legendary country singer @entity18 was arrested this year on a driving while intoxicated charge			1
@entity22 state rep. @entity21 was arrested this year on a charge of drunken driving			1
@entity26 's @entity25 said @entity28 , a @entity29 assistant basketball coach , was " swerving all over the road " before being arrested last week on a driving under the influence charge			1
we can try to make this conversation about @entity4 players -- but of the nearly 2,000 men who suit up per season , 14 dui arrests are made , according to @entity36			1
that equates to a .7 % percent rate			2
the rate for men in the general population ages 20 to 29 , the age bracket of most @entity4 players , is twice that			1
meanwhile , men 21 to 34 are responsible for 42 % of all @entity47 deaths			2
read more : @entity7 players involved in fatal crash were ' like brothers ' this issue is n't about football players			2
the @entity53 does n't stop serving alcohol at the beginning of the third quarter because officials are afraid the players are going to try to drive home drunk			0
if we want to use this tragedy in @entity62 to talk about @entity63 , then perhaps we need to be more focused on the men who watch the games , not play them			1
the stats suggest the average guy probably does n't need to go the full six degrees of separation before finding a connection with another guy who got behind the wheel of a car when he should n't have			0
when i look back at my 20s , i know i 've been lucky more than once , and i thank @entity76 that his grace covered me when my pride put me -- and others -- in harm 's way			0
too proud to say i 've had too much to drink because men are supposed to be able to handle our liquor			0
too proud to say i need a ride home , because that would be asking for help -- and men do n't like to do that			0
too proud to admit i might 've been out of control , even though being out of control is the main side effect of excessive drinking			1
the @entity94 says men are much more likely than women to drink excessively and drive at high speeds			0
men average about 12.5 binge drinking episodes a year ; women average 2.7			2
and yet we want to make this entire conversation about sports , when this is no more a sports story than a rerun of " @entity106			0
" last year @entity107 , a state representative and bar owner from @entity109 , got on the @entity111 floor and advocated for a repeal of all @entity47 laws because they hurt small businesses and " they 're destroying a way of life			0
" fyi : there is no professional sports team in @entity109			0
our culture promotes a casual attitude about intoxication -- from " @entity124 " to @entity127 's @entity129 - winning " @entity128 " -- and then gets all pious when something bad happens because of alcohol			1
if we want to have a grownup conversation about @entity63 , that 's where it should start : otherwise we 're just sucking up oxygen			0
does this mean the @entity4 should ignore drunken driving arrests of its players ? of course not			1
but the @entity94 says adults got behind the wheel drunk an estimated 112 million times in 2010 -- nearly 300,000 times a day -- and that 81 % of all drunken drivers are men			2
so whatever thoughts we may be harboring about athletes who drink and drive , it would be wise to extend those feelings far beyond the realm of sports			0
nearly 11,000 people are killed each year because of alcohol - impaired driving			0
but since 1998 , there have only been three @entity4 players who have been suspected of having killed someone because of driving drunk			1
you can do the rest of the math from there			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			2

@entity164 : @entity4 *slammed* after player 's arrest on intoxication manslaughter charge
but drunken driving is not an @entity4 issue , he says , since it happens in all walks of life
@entity164 : general population , mostly young men , have much higher rate than @entity4
we need to talk about the culture that promotes excessive drinking , he says
