-- @entity2 agreed thursday to take command of enforcing a no - fly zone over @entity5 and was considering taking control of the full @entity8 - backed military mission , secretary - general @entity1 told @entity0			1
@entity1 's announcement fell short of what @entity11 president @entity10 has sought , and it was unclear if concerns by @entity15 and some other @entity2 allies over coalition airstrikes on @entity5 ground forces would prevent @entity2 from agreeing to expand its command over the entire mission			1
" what we have decided today is that @entity2 will enforce the no - fly zone , " @entity1 said in an interview with @entity0 's @entity23			2
" we are considering whether @entity2 should take on overall responsibility			0
that decision has not been made yet			0
" @entity1 said he expected @entity2 to take over full control of the no - fly - zone enforcement in a few days , and to decide on the issue of broader responsibility " within the coming days			2
" however , a senior administration official said that in fact , @entity2 reached an understanding that it will control the rest of the mission , with details on the extent of the mission still being worked out			1
the administration official , who spoke to reporters on condition of not being identified by name , said @entity2 ambassadors actually made two decisions thursday			2
one was to take over command of the no - fly zone , and the other was a political decision to take responsibility for enforcing the full @entity53 resolution authorizing the military mission			1
" that latter part , we are still completing the operational planning and expect to be completed by this weekend , " the administration official said			0
the @entity8 resolution authorizes a no - fly zone , enforcement of an arms ban , and other steps as necessary to protect @entity5 civilians			0
so far , the @entity11 - led coalition has interpreted that to include airstrikes on @entity5 ground forces threatening the rebel stronghold of @entity70 and in other areas			0
thursday 's agreement was reached in a conference call between @entity11 secretary of state @entity74 and her counterparts from @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity15 , according to the senior administration official and diplomatic officials who spoke on condition of not being identified by name			1
at @entity2 headquarters later , the meeting of ambassadors extended long past its expected conclusion			0
@entity2 sources said a major sticking point involved the rules of engagement for coalition forces enforcing the @entity8 resolution , with @entity15 raising concerns over details			1
when @entity1 finally emerged to announce an agreement , it was clear that questions over the rules of engagement remained unresolved			0
asked if the announcement revealed a split in @entity2 over the mission , @entity1 said no. however , he also acknowledged that if unaltered , the agreement would mean the overall @entity5 mission would have two parts , with @entity2 enforcing the no - fly zone and arms blockade , and the @entity11 - led coalition that launched the mission handling other necessary civilian protection			1
@entity1 said @entity2 would use the mission 's already established chain of command for enforcing the no - fly zone			1
the @entity2 supreme commander , an @entity11 , would be in charge , but the mission would be under @entity2 control , @entity1 noted			1
in addition , @entity113 partners including @entity115 countries would participate , @entity1 said			0
after @entity1 's announcement , @entity117 told reporters that all 28 @entity2 allies authorized military authorities to develop a plan for @entity2 to take on the broader mission of civilian protection under @entity125			1
" @entity2 is well - suited to coordinating this international effort and ensuring that all participating nations are working effectively together toward our shared goals , " said @entity117 , who took no questions			0
" this coalition includes countries beyond @entity2 , including @entity115 partners , and we expect all of them to be providing important political guidance going forward			0
we have always said that @entity115 leadership and participation is crucial			0
" @entity117 also said she will travel to @entity140 on tuesday to attend an international meeting on @entity5 that will include @entity2 allies and @entity115 partners in the @entity5 mission			2
@entity2 sources told @entity0 that the shift in command for enforcing a no - fly zone was expected by sunday night			2
according to the sources , @entity2 has sent a directive to @entity2 's military chain of command asking for a plan on how to execute an expanded role for enforcement of @entity125			1
under the expanded role , called " no - fly plus " by some officials , @entity2 might be given more robust rules of engagement to ensure that civilians are protected , the sources said			0
one proposal for " no - fly plus " would allow some coalition forces to withdraw from certain missions , the sources said			0
so far , @entity11 forces have taken on the bulk of the @entity5 mission , according to figures provided by the @entity163			2
of a total of 175 @entity166 missiles fired , 168 were from the @entity11 and seven from @entity76 , the only two countries to possess them , while @entity11 planes have flown almost two - thirds of the sorties and @entity11 ships comprise more than two - thirds of the total involved			1
the @entity11 aerial involvement will ease once @entity2 assumes full operational control of the no - fly zone , officials say			1
it was unclear whether the number of @entity182 ships taking part also would decrease , as well as what role @entity11 forces would play in the civilian protection part of the mission			1
@entity10 has repeatedly said that the @entity11 will turn over control of the @entity5 mission to allies within " days , not weeks			2
" while he specified that would mean no @entity11 planes in the air over @entity5 , @entity10 left open the possibility of @entity11 naval vessels playing a role in blockading @entity5 against arms shipments			0
@entity0 's @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 contributed to this story .			0

new : @entity11 official says @entity2 agrees take on broader command , but details *pending*
the deal means @entity2 will assume command of one part of the military mission
@entity2 is still considering whether to also take command of the rest of the mission
the agreement followed talks involving @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity15 and the @entity11
