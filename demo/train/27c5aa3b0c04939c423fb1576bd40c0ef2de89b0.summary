@entity0 , @entity1 -- police are investigating whether the shootings of five @entity6 in @entity0 , @entity1 , were a hate crime after the weekend arrests of two white suspects in the case , local authorities said sunday			1
@entity11 , 19 , and @entity12 , 32 , are scheduled to be arraigned monday morning			1
@entity0 police arrested them early sunday after a series of tips that led investigators to @entity19 's burned pickup , a vehicle that matched a description reported at the crime scenes , according to their arrest reports			1
the shootings left three dead and two wounded			1
both suspects are charged with three counts of murder and two counts of shooting with intent to kill , police said			1
" we 're going to explore any possible motives , " police chief @entity30 told reporters sunday afternoon			1
but he said the investigation was still going on , and @entity35 , the head of the @entity37 's @entity1 office , said sunday that it was " premature " to talk about hate crimes			2
" we have yet to analyze all the information to understand the motivations of these subjects in this case , " @entity40 said			2
@entity19 had written a racial slur on his @entity47 page in a post marking the anniversary of his father 's 2010 killing			1
but the entry also noted his girlfriend 's recent suicide , and a man at @entity19 's home told @entity2 , " you do n't know what this family 's been through			2
" the shootings began about 1 a.m. friday in predominantly black neighborhoods in north @entity0			1
the first victim , 49 - year - old @entity63 , died at a hospital			2
two others were shot just three minutes later , but survived and were released from the hospital sunday , @entity30 said			2
another person was shot and killed about 2 a.m. , while the third victim was found around 8 a.m. next to a funeral home			2
@entity30 identified the other two victims as @entity71 and @entity72			2
investigators have found a weapon they believe was involved the case , said @entity77 maj. @entity76 , who led the task force assembled to probe the shootings			1
but he said investigators did not yet know which of the suspects may have fired the fatal shots			2
nor was the relationship between @entity19 and @entity12 clear sunday			2
@entity76 said they were not related , describing them only as " associates			0
" police put out an appeal for tips over the weekend , and there was an " outpouring " after a saturday afternoon news conference , @entity76 said			1
those tips led to @entity19 , with one reporting that he was planning to burn a white pickup truck that had been identified at the shooting scenes , according to the arrest reports			1
police found the burned vehicle , registered to @entity19 , on saturday evening , leading them to put him under surveillance and get warrants to arrest him and search his home			1
@entity19 and @entity12 were arrested a few blocks away from @entity19 's residence shortly before 2 a.m. sunday , according to the reports			1
" in my 23 years of law enforcement , i do n't think i 've ever seen any crime as heinous as this , " @entity76 said			0
" but at the same time , i do n't think i 've seen such an outpouring of support and cooperation from the community			1
" police reports listed the same address for @entity19 and @entity12 , a home in a rural area on the northern outskirts of @entity0			1
an arriving couple who identified themselves only as @entity19 's relatives said @entity19 's father had been shot to death in april 2010 , and @entity19 had been left to care for his 6 - month - old child after his girlfriend shot and killed herself in front of him a few months ago			0
" his mind could n't take it anymore , i guess , " the man who called himself @entity19 's uncle told @entity2 , adding , " i guess it just snapped his mind			0
" earlier , others at the home hurled abuse at a @entity2 crew that approached the driveway			0
one of @entity19 's neighbors , 83 - year - old @entity138 , said @entity19 " is a very nice young man , very well mannered			0
" he would help me over here , " @entity138 said			0
" when his dogs turn over my trash cans , he comes and cleans it up -- very nice young man			0
" but on @entity19 's @entity47 page , a friend warned him not to " do anything stupid " after a friday night message that read " it just mite be the time to call it quits			1
" " i hate to say it like that but i 'm done if something does happen tonite be ready for another funeral later , " @entity19 wrote			0
and on thursday afternoon , he noted that it was the second anniversary of his father 's death " at the hands of a f * * * ing nigger			0
" " it 's hard not to go off between that and sheran i 'm gone in the head , " he wrote , referring to his girlfriend			0
the facebook page was taken down sunday afternoon			0
authorities would not comment sunday on any possible link between friday 's shootings and the death of @entity19 's father			1
" when five black people appear to be shot by a white person , then the immediate reaction is there is a racial component , " @entity0 mayor @entity169 told @entity2			0
" if that 's how the prosecution comes out , we certainly support and will help in any manner , shape or form to bring an end to that point of view			0
" about 30 representatives from four law enforcement agencies -- the @entity0 police , @entity183 , the @entity185 and the @entity37 -- had been working around the clock looking for those responsible for the shootings			1
news of the arrests came as a relief to residents , many of whom had changed their daily habits since the shooting			0
" a lot of people in my community were afraid that they could n't go outside			0
they did n't know if they could even go to church , did n't know if they could go to the grocery store , " city councilman @entity201 said			0
now , he said , @entity208 " can feel they are safe " -- and he said he hoped the cooperation they gave police could encourage others to come forward with information on other still - unsolved killings			1
" i get a feeling from my community that there 's going to be a better relationship with the @entity217 , " he said			0
" the @entity217 has shown they can solve crimes , they can solve them fast			0
" @entity2 's @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226 contributed to this report .			0
