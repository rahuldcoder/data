in november , the @entity15 carried tests on @entity17 over two days at the @entity34 @entity33 in @entity35 to determine if his prosthetic limbs , known as " cheetah " prosthetics , could be considered a technical aid			1
a team of more than 10 scientists used high speed cameras , special equipment to measure ground reaction forces and a three - dimensional scanner to record body mass. the @entity15 determined that @entity17 was able to run " with about 25 per cent less energy expenditure " than other sprinters , it said in a statement released on its web site monday			1
" the positive work , or returned energy , from the prosthetic blade is close to three times higher than with the human ankle joint in maximum sprinting , " the statement said			0
" this means that the mechanical advantage of the blade in relation to the healthy ankle joint of an able - bodied athlete is higher than 30 per cent			2

athletics @entity27 said it would immediately apply the decision which does does not affect @entity17 ' eligibility for @entity4 events			1
" it 's unfortunate because he could have boosted team athletics at the @entity102 at @entity103 because he had the potential to qualify , " said @entity97 , president of @entity98			0
" there 's not much we can do , " @entity97 added			0
" it rules him out with immediate effect			0
