-- the @entity2 will not accept @entity3 as a " nuclear state , " secretary of state @entity1 warned on tuesday , just hours after @entity5 announced plans to restart a nuclear reactor it shut down five years ago			1
@entity3 's decision comes as tensions on the @entity11 escalate over @entity13 's threats to wage war against the @entity2 and @entity15			1
" the bottom line is simply that what @entity13 is choosing to do is provocative			0
it is dangerous , reckless			0
the @entity2 will not accept the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) as a nuclear state , " @entity1 said during a joint briefing in @entity20 with @entity15 foreign minister @entity21			1
" and i reiterate again the @entity2 will do what is necessary to defend ourselves and defend our allies , @entity15 and @entity26			1
we are fully prepared and capable of doing so , and i think the @entity3 understands that			1
" @entity3 's declaration that it would reopen the reactor demonstrates @entity13 's commitment to the country 's nuclear weapons program that the international community has tried to persuade it to abandon			1
the @entity3 's state - run @entity34 , @entity34 , reported that the reclusive state 's atomic energy department intends to " readjust and restart all the nuclear facilities " at its main nuclear complex , in @entity39			1
those facilities include a uranium enrichment facility and a reactor that was " mothballed and disabled " under an agreement reached in october 2007 during talks among @entity3 , the @entity2 and four other nations , @entity34 said			1
the announcement was followed by a plea for calm from @entity50 @entity49 ban ki - moon , who is @entity15			1
@entity3 defectors return rhetorical fire " the current crisis has already gone too far , " he said in a statement from @entity55			2
" nuclear threats are not a game			0
aggressive rhetoric and military posturing only result in counteractions , and fuel fear and instability			0
" things must begin to calm down , as this situation , made worse by the lack of communication , could lead down a path that nobody should want to follow			0
" @entity70 said dialogue and negotiations are " the only way to resolve the current crisis			0
" the tensions on the @entity11 have led @entity5 to sever a key military hot line with @entity76 and declare void the 1953 armistice that stopped the @entity78			0
the @entity2 has made a show of its military strength amid annual training exercises with @entity15 , flying @entity87 stealth bombers capable of carrying conventional or nuclear weapons , @entity81 - era @entity80 and @entity82 stealth fighters over @entity15			1
on tuesday , the @entity2 positioned a second destroyer -- the @entity91 -- near the @entity11 , a defense official said on condition of anonymity			2
the official was not authorized to release details to the media			0
a day earlier , the @entity98 moved a warship and a sea - based radar platform closer to the @entity3 coast in order to monitor that country 's military moves , including possible new missile launches , the @entity97 said monday			2
@entity3 on wednesday also blocked more than 480 @entity15 workers from entering the jointly run @entity107 , which sits on the @entity3 side of the border , according to the @entity110			1
" @entity3 said today that it is only approving people to go back to @entity15 and not approving entrance " to the complex , said @entity111 , a spokesman for the ministry			1
he urged the @entity116 to resume letting workers enter			0
there are 861 @entity15 inside @entity107 at the moment , the ministry said , and 446 have registered to leave			2
the symbol of an era of better relations between @entity76 and @entity5 , @entity107 is a joint economic cooperation zone between the two koreas where scores of @entity15 companies operate			2
it also is an important source of hard currency for the @entity3			2
the move comes after threats in recent days by @entity5 to shut down the industrial complex			2
@entity76 , meanwhile , on monday warned that any provocative moves from @entity3 would trigger a strong response " without any political considerations			0
" @entity2 moves warship , sea - based radar to watch @entity3 murky motivation the motivation behind the @entity116 's announcement tuesday on the nuclear facilities was unclear , said @entity141 , director of the @entity142 at @entity143 in @entity144 , suggesting that it was unlikely to make a big difference militarily for the country , which is already believed to have four to 10 nuclear weapons			1
the @entity3 may be hoping to use the move as a bargaining chip in any future talks , he said , or it could be an attempt by the country 's young leader to shore up support domestically			2
" it 's just a very murky situation , " @entity141 said			0
" the danger is that we can misread one another and end up with a conflict that no one wants			0
" @entity163 , a key @entity3 ally , expressed regret over @entity5 's announcement about the reactor			2
" @entity163 has consistently advocated denuclearization on the peninsula and maintaining peace and stability in the region , " @entity168 spokesman @entity167 said tuesday at a regular news briefing			0
@entity26 chief cabinet secretary @entity175 said the move would need to be dealt with in a serious manner , noting that it breached the @entity3 's previous commitments			1
on tuesday , @entity1 refused to speculate about @entity3 's intentions or what its strategy may be with regard to its plans to reopen its reactor			1
" we 've heard an extraordinary amount of unacceptable rhetoric from the @entity3 government in the last days			0
so let me be perfectly clear here today : the @entity2 will defend and protect ourselves , and our treaty ally , the @entity3 , " he said			1
@entity1 reiterated the @entity2 policy with regard to @entity3 , saying the @entity2 believes there is " a very simple way " for @entity5 to end the sanctions by ending its nuclear ambitions			1
@entity1 was scheduled to visit @entity76 next week , while @entity15 's president was due in @entity20 for talks with president @entity201			2
@entity15 warns @entity3 of ' strong response ' to any attack a torrent of threats the @entity3 's latest declaration comes after a stream of verbal attacks against @entity15 and the @entity2 in recent weeks , including the threat of a nuclear strike			1
@entity5 's angry words appear to have been fueled by the recent joint military exercises by the @entity2 and @entity15 in the region , as well as tougher @entity50 sanctions in response to @entity3 's latest nuclear test in february			1
much of the bellicose rhetoric , analysts say , is n't matched by the country 's military capabilities			0
nuclear weapons : who has what ? the @entity116 's announcement tuesday follows a new strategic line " on simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of the nuclear armed force			0
" it was announced sunday during a meeting of a key committee of the ruling @entity232 headed by @entity13			0
the work of adapting and restarting the nuclear facilities " will be put into practice without delay , " @entity34 said			2
the measures would help solve " the acute shortage of electricity , " as well as improving the " quality and quantity " of the country 's nuclear arsenal , it said			0
threats of annihilation normal for @entity15 @entity39 's back story in june 2008 , the usually secretive @entity3 government made a public show of destroying the cooling tower of the @entity39 reactor to demonstrate its compliance with a deal to disable its nuclear facilities			1
but two months later , as its then - leader , @entity254 , balked at @entity2 demands for close inspections of its nuclear facilities , the @entity3 started to express second thoughts			1
it said it was suspending the disabling of its nuclear facilities and considering steps to restore the facilities at @entity39 " to their original state			0
" in november 2009 , it announced it was reprocessing nuclear fuel rods as part of measures to resume activities at @entity39			0
it noted success in turning the plutonium it had extracted into weapons - grade material			0
opinion : why @entity13 is not crazy @entity0 's @entity271 in @entity76 , @entity272 in @entity273 , @entity274 in @entity275 , @entity276 in @entity277 and @entity278 and @entity279 in @entity20 contributed to this report .			0
