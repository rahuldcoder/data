@entity0 -- after four years in which he has alternately helped -- and miffed -- the @entity4 , vice president @entity2 told @entity1 that his role as the deal - closer is clearly his most comfortable yet			1
" i have spent a lot of time in this town			0
and i have personal relationships with people i strongly disagree with , but there 's trust			2
and so i 'm a logical person , a logical person to , as they say or you guys say , close the deal , " @entity2 told @entity1 chief political analyst @entity14 in an exclusive pre-inaugural interview			1
@entity2 cut the last - minute deal last month with @entity22 minority leader @entity21 that averted going over the fiscal cliff -- after president @entity26 's negotiations with @entity4 speaker @entity27 failed			1
he was given the high - profile task of putting together the administration 's sweeping gun control proposals and will play a major role in pushing them through @entity33			1
he is quick to emphasize that he was not undercutting the president when he reached deals with congressional @entity36			2
" i have his complete support for what i 'm saying , because i know what he wants , no. 1 , " @entity2 said			1
" it 's the president , not me			1
" sworn in again , @entity26 lingers for last look @entity26 and the vice president ran against each other for the 2008 @entity47 nomination , and @entity2 said that helped forge a relationship			1
" so when we got into this deal , we did n't have what other administrations have had , where the vice president and the president have a different take on the major issues of the day			1
we 're totally simpatico , " @entity2 said			1
he told @entity14 that he never had any problem with any assignment he was given in the first term , when he was tasked with overseeing the $ 787 billion stimulus program , cutting several key fiscal deals with congressional @entity36 once they took control of the @entity65 in the mid-terms and leading the effort to end the @entity69 military presence in @entity70			0
@entity2 makes second term official in the second term , one of his major duties will be to help get congressional approval for the most far - reaching gun control legislation in decades			1
after dozens of meetings with more than 120 groups spanning the various issues related to gun violence , he led the inter-agency effort that came up with the specific proposals			0
@entity2 and @entity26 know they will have to mount a major public relations campaign to try to overcome the strength and opposition of the @entity87			1
" there 's a growing consensus in this country , a growing consensus among even sportsmen and other groups , about everything from who should own a weapon ... and what information should be available , " he told @entity1 , saying he believed it would be easier to pass this type of legislation in the wake of the elementary school shootings in @entity93 , @entity94			2
@entity2 , a major gun - control proponent who has gone up against the @entity87 for decades , was the major reason the 1994 assault weapons bill passed			1
a tale of two terms : unfinished business and battles ahead asked if he thought the @entity87 is stoking fear against the president , he responded , " look , i think the @entity87 's reaction -- overreaction -- is a reflection of the vulnerability of their position			1
" @entity2 is also expected to be one of the key players in coming fiscal fights : automatic spending cuts set to take effect in a month , funding the government and the debt ceiling			2
@entity4 @entity36 just signaled they would support a three month extension			2
the vice president said that is a hopeful sign that the @entity36 would not allow the country to default on its debts			1
" the @entity36 are n't going to do that			2
they 've finally figured it out			0
all this bluster about you 're going to renege on the debt , " he said			0
" they will not because there are more responsible people in that party than irresponsible			0
so it 's not going to happen			2
" @entity2 said he hoped there is still a path forward to allow the @entity4 and congressional leaders to reach agreement on a major deficit reduction deal -- one that has so far eluded them despite optimism in the past			1
@entity2 's recommendations on gun control to @entity26 " so we ought to be able to , in the next three months , finish out that grand bargain to get us to the point of ... where debt to @entity159 ( gross domestic product ) is about 3 % , " he said			1
" every economist , left , right and center , says that -- when that happens , the economy grows			0
i think we 'll get there			0
" as the president and vice president have worked to achieve many of the administration 's major goals , the two have had some disagreements -- @entity2 did not agree that the timing of the mission to kill @entity173 was right , and the vice president got out in front of his boss when @entity2 voiced support for same - sex marriage on " @entity179 " last may			1
" we sometimes disagreed on tactics as to how to proceed to try to get what he wanted done , which i 've agreed with , but we 've never disagreed on policy			0
and even the so - called discussion about , you know , my saying i was comfortable with gay and lesbians and relationships , i knew his positions , " @entity2 said			1
when @entity14 asked about those specific comments , he recounted how the president reacted			2
" i walked into the office and he got up , smiled , gave me a big hug and he said , ' now , i 'll tell you what , man , that 's one of the things i like about you , you say what 's on your mind , ' " the vice president recounted			1
he recently told the @entity204 it did cause " a little apoplexy " around the @entity4			2
" it did , but not with him			0
" it was with the president 's staff			1
some of @entity2 's candor has at times has not gone over well with @entity4 officials			1
@entity26 's second - term priorities asked how he can tell when he may have done something the president does n't like or makes him angry , @entity2 said that is " easy			1
" " we made a deal early on , when either one of us are dissatisfied we just flat tell the other person			0
and so one -- lunch once a week , you know , that 's when we talk			0
and when he has n't liked something i 've done , he just flat tells me			0
" @entity14 asked : " he says , ' @entity2 , you should n't have done that ? ' " @entity2 responded " he says , ' @entity2 , look ... i do n't agree with the way you did that			1
you , you know , why did you do a , @entity232 , c or @entity234 ? ' or he will say , or i will say , ' hey , look , man , i do n't like the way this is going ' -- so there 's complete openness			2
" @entity2 , who at times has been known more by the public for his gaffes than his policy work , has seen his approval ratings rise recently			2
he has hinted he may seek the @entity47 presidential nomination in 2016 and told @entity1 any decision about his future is not imminent			0
he did attend @entity248 's inaugural party in @entity0 this weekend and invited @entity250 's governor to his official swearing - in sunday			0
those two states vote first in presidential nominating contests in three years			0
" there 's a whole lot of reasons why i would n't run			2
i have n't made that decision			0
and i do n't have to make that decision for a while			0
in the meantime , there 's one thing i know i have to do , no matter what i do			0
i have to help this president move this country to the next stage			0
" asked whether he was ready to run against @entity266 , who many democrats expect to be a candidate in 2016 , he responded : " i have n't made that judgment			0
and @entity266 has n't made that judgment			0
but i can tell you what -- everything that should be done over the next two years that i should be part of would have to be done whether i run or i do n't run			0
" if this administration is successful , whoever is running as a @entity277 is better positioned to win			0
if we 're not successful , whoever runs as the nominee is going to be less likely to win			0
" four other priorities for @entity26 's next four years @entity1 producer @entity281 contributed to this report			1

@entity2 says he 's comfortable with most recent role as deal closer
vice president says running against @entity26 in 2008 helped forge relationship
one of @entity26 's biggest roles will be trying to get @entity26 's guns agenda through @entity33
some of @entity2 's candor has n't gone over well with @entity4 staff
