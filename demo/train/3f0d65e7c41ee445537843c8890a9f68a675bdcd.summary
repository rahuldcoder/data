-- scientists said wednesday that they had discovered a new particle whose characteristics match those of the @entity4 , the most sought - after particle in physics , which could help unlock some of the universe 's deepest secrets			1
" we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature , " said @entity8 , the director general of the @entity9 , which has been carrying out experiments in search of the @entity4 at the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , the world 's largest particle accelerator			1
" the discovery of a particle consistent with the @entity4 opens the way to more detailed studies , requiring larger statistics , which will pin down the new particle 's properties , and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe , " @entity8 said			2
the particle has been so difficult to pin down that the physicist @entity30 reportedly wanted to call his book " @entity31			0
" but he truncated that epithet to " @entity31 , " which may have helped elevate the particle 's allure in popular culture			0
more : why the ' @entity4 ' may be key to universe announcements by scientists about their analysis of data generated by trillions of particle collisions in the @entity13 , which is located beneath the @entity44 , drew avid applause at an eagerly awaited seminar in @entity47 , @entity48 , on wednesday			1
finding the @entity4 would help explain the origin of mass , one of the open questions in physicists ' current understanding of the way the universe works			1
the researchers stressed the preliminary nature of the results they were announcing wednesday			1
" a more complete picture of today 's observations will emerge later this year after the @entity13 provides the experiments with more data , " the nuclear research organization , known as @entity9 , said in its statement			1
but despite the words of caution , the scientists ' mood and many of their comments were brimming with enthusiasm about the potential scope of what they had discovered			0
" it 's hard not to get excited by these results , " said @entity76 , the research director at @entity9			0
the announcements by the @entity9 researchers come two days after scientists in @entity82 said they had crept closer to proving the existence of the @entity4 but had been unable to reach a definitive conclusion			1
the @entity86 - based scientists outlined their final analysis based on more than 10 years of research and 500 trillion particle collisions using the @entity86 @entity92 's @entity91 collider near @entity93 , @entity82 , whose budgetary woes shut it down last year			0
@entity96 : the woman at the leading edge of physics they passed the baton onto their counterparts using the @entity13 , which is much more powerful than the @entity91			2
located 328 feet underneath the border of @entity104 and @entity48 , the @entity13 cost $ 10 billion and has been sending particles smashing together in 17 - mile tunnel for the past 18 months			2
high speed proton collisions generate a range of even smaller particles that scientists have been sifting through in search of a signal in the data suggesting the existence of the @entity4			1
the elusive particle is part of a theory first proposed by physicist @entity118 and others in the 1960s to explain how particles obtain mass. @entity4 is like ... a @entity124 fan ? the theory proposes that a so - called @entity118 energy field exists everywhere in the universe			1
as particles zoom around in this field , they interact with and attract @entity118 bosons , which cluster around the particles in varying numbers			0
imagine the universe like a party			0
relatively unknown guests at the party can pass quickly through the room unnoticed ; more popular guests will attract groups of people ( the @entity4 ) who will then slow their movement through the room			0
the speed of particles moving through the @entity118 field works much in the same way			0
certain particles will attract larger clusters of @entity4 -- and the more @entity118 bosons a particle attracts , the greater its mass will be			2
while finding the @entity4 wo n't tell us everything we need to know about how the universe works , it will fill in a huge hole in the @entity159 that has existed for more than 50 years , according to experts			2
" the @entity4 is the last missing piece of our current understanding of the most fundamental nature of the universe , " @entity161 , a physicist at @entity162 in @entity163 , told @entity0			1
