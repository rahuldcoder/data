" it is a party of one giant and a bunch of elves who might be running against her			1
" " she has a political organization , she has the history , she has respect from being a senator , first lady , secretary of state , i think it is just prudent for the @entity5 to assume she is the nominee and frankly i think it helps focus people , " he added			0
