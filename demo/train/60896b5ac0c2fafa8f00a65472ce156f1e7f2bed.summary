@entity0 -- a major immigration bill that would give millions of people living illegally in @entity4 a path to citizenship cleared a key legislative hurdle tuesday when a strong @entity9 majority voted to open debate on it			1
the 82 - 15 vote , with most republicans joining the chamber 's @entity14 majority in support , launched what was expected to be an arduous legislative journey for the 1,076 - page measure			1
both supporters and opponents expect the bill to pass the @entity9 despite fierce opposition from conservatives			1
however , one @entity27 foe said tuesday the @entity27 - controlled @entity28 would defeat it in its current form due to the pathway to citizenship			1
the legislation addresses an emotionally charged issue with huge political stakes for both parties			0
president @entity37 and @entity38 want to fulfill a promise to @entity40 , the nation 's fastest - growing demographic and a key voting bloc , to address the limbo of the 11 million immigrants living illegally in the country			1
a few hours before tuesday 's vote , @entity37 tried to build momentum for the proposal at a @entity28 event where he called it a commonsense approach to fix a broken system			1
5 things to know about immigration reform addressing concerns of the measure 's opponents , @entity37 emphasized it would increase spending on border security and require undocumented immigrants to pursue what could be a 13 - year path to eventual citizenship			1
" you have to pass background checks , you have to learn @entity68 , you have to pay taxes and a penalty and then you have to go to the back of the line behind everybody who has done things the right way and have tried to come here legally , " @entity37 said			0
latino voters backed @entity37 over @entity27 nominee @entity77 by a 44 - point margin last year , and @entity27 strategists are concerned about the party 's long term viability in national elections if that trend holds			1
in the @entity9 , republicans who forced tuesday 's procedural step that required at least 60 votes to launch debate on the immigration bill joined @entity38 to easily surpass that threshold			1
senate majority leader @entity89 warned that some @entity27 had no intention of supporting the measure even though they voted to open the formal debate and will propose amendments during the upcoming debate			1
opponents led by @entity27 sen. @entity96 of @entity97 accused @entity38 of insisting on the pathway to citizenship as part of the bill , knowing @entity28 conservatives wo n't accept it			1
the goal of @entity38 is to secure a popular campaign issue with @entity40 voters for the 2014 mid-term election and 2016 presidential election , he said			0
@entity110 senator revives debate over gay rights in immigration bill " i think it 's going to pass the @entity9 with a substantial margin , " @entity96 said			1
but " absent major revisions ... this bill will crash and burn in the @entity28			0
and it is designed to do so			0
" polls show many @entity40 favor some form of immigration policy overhaul , depending on the details of legislation			0
the bipartisan proposal before @entity9 was hammered out this spring by the so - called " @entity126 " senators -- four @entity38 and four @entity27			1
some congressional conservatives call opposing the " @entity126 " plan a matter of principle and say they wo n't bend			2
many consider any measure offering a path to citizenship tantamount to amnesty for those who entered the country illegally			2
in addition , concerns about whether the bill will tighten security along the nation 's porous borders , as asserted by backers of the plan , may make it difficult for conservatives to support it -- especially those up for re-election next year			0
" the bill grants permanent legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants , as currently written , without really any guarantee of securing the border			0
now , how would that possibly be a good idea ? " asked sen. @entity154 of @entity97 , the chamber 's no. 2 @entity27 , who voted tuesday for opening debate			2
sen. @entity160 , @entity161 , a member of the bipartisan " @entity126 " who is considered a possible @entity27 presidential contender in 2016 , argued that doing nothing amounts to what he called a " de facto amnesty " for immigrants currently living illegally in @entity4			1
@entity28 working on its own plan at the same time , @entity160 -- a popular conservative of @entity40 descent -- has made it clear that border security requirements must be toughened if he and other @entity27 skeptics will support it			2
he is pushing an amendment that would make @entity176 , not the executive branch , responsible for deciding if security metrics at the border have been met before other aspects of the reform bill -- including the pathway to citizenship -- are triggered			2
because @entity160 's support is so critical , other members of the bipartisan group have hinted they likely will back his proposal even though they are reluctant to make major changes to their original compromise			0
the vote on the @entity160 amendment will be one of the most closely watched as floor action unfolds over the next three weeks			0
other planned amendments will involve stepped - up security checks of people entering the country , temporary visas for high - and low - skilled workers , and other technical provisions			0
@entity37 says no one will get everything in a rare display of unity , the @entity4 @entity204 , union leaders and other interest groups have come out in support of the @entity9 plan			2
advocates for comprehensive reform won the first major legislative victory last month when the @entity212 voted 13 - 5 to approve the " @entity126 " plan			2
@entity14 leaders hope to have a @entity9 vote on final passage by the end of june			0
a bipartisan group has been working on a separate immigration plan in the @entity28 , but the effort suffered a setback last week when a key member dropped out of the negotiations			0
previous efforts to pass immigration reform fell short last decade even though it was said to be a priority of president @entity228			0
now @entity37 has made the issue a major priority of his second term			0

@entity38 , republicans vote *overwhelmingly* to allow debate
president @entity37 urges @entity176 to pass the bipartisan @entity9 measure
