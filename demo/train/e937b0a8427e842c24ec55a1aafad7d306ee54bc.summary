-- @entity2 's energy imports are so fundamental to its survival and development that @entity2 's new leadership has taken extraordinary steps to secure future supplies			1
in a flurry of official visits over the past two months involving president @entity10 , premier @entity11 and foreign minister @entity12 , @entity2 has sought to bolster its energy relations with big strategic neighbors @entity15 and @entity16 , key energy exporters @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity20 , emerging resources suppliers such as @entity22 and the @entity23 in @entity20 , and renewable energy pioneer @entity25			1
in addition , @entity2 hosted a visit by @entity29 leader @entity28 , whose discussions with @entity10 and @entity11 touched on clean energy expertise and the burgeoning resources trade between the two countries			1
@entity2 's push for energy security and its willingness to buy assets around the globe may drive up costs for other energy importers like @entity16 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			1
they will have to compete with @entity2 through a combination of co-operation , conservation and technological advances			0
but @entity10 maintains that @entity2 's investments are creating development opportunities for the rest of @entity52 and the world			1
" the rest of @entity52 and the world can not enjoy prosperity and stability without @entity2 , " @entity10 told the @entity54 held on the @entity2 island of @entity56 last month			2
next week , @entity10 will visit the oil and gas - rich countries of @entity64 and @entity65			2
he will follow that with a two - day summit with @entity69 president @entity68 in @entity70 on june 7 - 8 , where a packed agenda of political and commercial issues almost certainly will touch on energy			2
@entity2 's big three state - owned oil and gas entities @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 already are investors in @entity80 energy assets			1
there has been a spate of @entity2 oil and gas investments in @entity20 , the @entity85 , @entity15 and @entity29 -- part of a multi-pronged push for the world 's second largest economy to meet its energy needs			1
in @entity92 , @entity10 and @entity15 president @entity91 agreed to cooperate on oil and gas pipeline developments from @entity94 to @entity2 , while state - owned @entity95 struck a deal with @entity2 's biggest oil and gas producer , @entity75 , giving @entity75 access to @entity99 resources			1
@entity75 also agreed to buy more oil from @entity95 under a new 25 - year loan deal , and to work with @entity15 's biggest gas exporter @entity102 on a new gas pipeline into @entity2			1
" @entity2 - @entity15 cooperation in energy is manifold , comprehensive and full - fledged , " @entity10 said			1
but price , technology and the environment may all conspire to limit the @entity2 - @entity15 energy trade			2
the harsh operating conditions and environmental hazards of the @entity99 may limit chances for cooperation			0
big projects such as @entity115 in northwest @entity94 are behind schedule because of the limited @entity99 infrastructure			0
as the technology improves , @entity2 stands to benefit from gas and oil shipments via the @entity121 , but that will require massive investments in icebreakers and ice strengthened tankers			2
read more : @entity2 eyes @entity99 options in energy , transport @entity2 is spreading its energy bets , not wanting to become too reliant on any one place given the volatile political situation in many energy - providing countries			0
@entity135 has long been a valued supplier , as has @entity137 , while @entity138 and @entity139 are coming back into contention			0
@entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 are other substantial exporters			0
@entity29 is emerging as a key provider to @entity2 of liquefied natural gas ( @entity115 ) from its @entity149 operations -- where @entity75 has invested 10 % of the future @entity151 project			1
@entity80 could also become a competitive supplier of lng after 2015 as a result of its shale gas bonanza that is rewriting the global energy trade outlook			0
@entity75 and @entity2 's two other main state - owned oil and gas entities , @entity77 and @entity76 , have invested in @entity159 and @entity69 oil and gas projects			1
@entity2 has its own substantial shale gas reserves in areas such as the @entity163 and @entity164 basins , of which 36 trillion cubic meters could be recoverable , according to @entity166 estimates			0
besides government deals , @entity2 is leaning more on the expertise of international oil and gas majors			2
@entity172 has a government - approved production sharing contact with @entity75 in a shale gas exploration block in the @entity163 basin			0
@entity177 has begun a shale gas drilling program with @entity77			0
@entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 also have shale aspirations in @entity2			0
in the meantime , gas piped from @entity52 has been a mainstay of @entity2 's economy			1
this year @entity188 will pump more gas through its 1830 kilometer @entity190 to @entity2			0
last october , @entity75 began work on one of @entity2 's biggest infrastructure projects , the $ 20 billion , 5000 - kilometer pipeline from @entity195 in the northwest to @entity197 on @entity2 's southeast coast			1
completion is expected in 2015 , and most of the gas will come from @entity52 , with about 5 billion cubic meters from @entity195			0
later this year , there will be another option when the new 770 kilometer gas pipeline from @entity207 's @entity206 port in the @entity208 to @entity209 in @entity211 province is expected to becoming operational , supplying up to 12 billion cubic meters a year of gas drawn mainly from @entity207 's offshore fields			0
all of these developments underpin one fundamental fact : @entity2 's appetite for energy is voracious , and growing .			2
