-- @entity1 is on the verge of unveiling an @entity4 subscription service for some of @entity7 's specialist video channels , to finance a broader range of content and add a second revenue stream to the digital video market leader			1
the move , which has been in the works for months , could be announced as early as this week			0
it will apply to as many as 50 @entity7 channels , people familiar with the plan say			0
viewers will be able to subscribe to each channel for as little as $ 1.99 a month			1
the subscription service will enable channel operators to produce different content , such as tv shows and films , a person familiar with the plan said			1
advertising on @entity7 and rival video sites has risen fast , but remains a fraction of television budgets			0
digital video advertising will jump from $ 2.93bn to $ 4.14bn in 2013 , @entity32 estimates , but will account for just 2.4 per cent of all ad spending			0
@entity7 claims the lion 's share of that revenue			2
@entity36 at @entity37 estimates that @entity7 's ad revenues will rise from $ 1.3bn in 2012 to $ 2bn this year and @entity39 said on friday that its revenues could exceed $ 15bn " in the next several years " , roughly matching @entity41 or @entity42			1
@entity7 told the @entity0 that it had " nothing to announce " regarding channel subscriptions but was " looking into creating a subscription platform that could bring even more great content to @entity7 for our users to enjoy and provide our creators with another vehicle to generate revenue from their content , beyond the rental and ad - supported models we offer "			1
@entity7 's channel partners include @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 -- a network for gamers			1
it is unclear which channels have signed on to the new service			0
cable and satellite channels , which traditionally rely on a dual revenue stream model , are eyeing @entity7 's subscription service to generate revenue from older shows and new programming , according to another person familiar with the project			1
@entity7 has moved away from its early days as a destination for user - generated content to professionally produced video that would not look out of place on television			2
in the past 18 months it has spent more than $ 200m on advances to dozens of start - up channels			0
the new channels have helped expand @entity7 's audience to 1bn users who watch 6bn hours of video each month			1
every one of @entity87 's 100 largest brands has advertised on the site			0
" we 're seeing a myriad of brands increasing their media spend , " said @entity89 , global head of content partnerships for @entity7			0
@entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 have all invested in companies that create or aggregate @entity7 content			0
traditional media companies are also eyeing audiences flocking to individual @entity7 channels : @entity106 , the company behind the @entity108 movies , this week acquired @entity109 , a " teen - focused " @entity7 network in a deal that could be worth $ 117m if earnings targets are met			2
subscription @entity7 channels will compete with the likes of @entity115 , the streaming service with more than 30m subscribers , and @entity118 , owned by @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity100 , which said last week it had surpassed 4m			2
