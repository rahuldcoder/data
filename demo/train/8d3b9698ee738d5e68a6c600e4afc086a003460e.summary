-- a few weeks ago , @entity1 , a 57 - year - old manufacturing worker in @entity2 , boarded a flight on @entity4 to @entity5 , @entity6 , with his @entity7			0
the flight attendant smiled at the two and said , " welcome aboard			0
" @entity4 allows some of its canine customers to be seated in the cabin			2
@entity1 has flown with @entity12 , his furry 40 - pound companion , in coach more than 15 times on @entity14 , the @entity16 - based airline that boasts " @entity17			0
" each time they fly , @entity12 wears a harness and sits strapped into a seat			2
" @entity12 gets the window seat , " said @entity1 , whose dog has won a series of frisbee competitions			0
" he likes to look out the window when the plane takes off and naps the rest of the way			0
" blame @entity30 's pet obsession , but in recent years , more members of the airline industry are embracing dogs and cats on board			2
@entity4 may be an extreme example , letting select dogs sit in the same seats as humans , but other airlines are relaxing their pet policies by letting smaller cats and dogs come into the cabin area			1
about a year ago , @entity14 began allowing certain " celebrity " dogs that appear in canine competitions , shows or advertisements to sit in seats			0
" they are just passengers with four legs instead of two , " said @entity50 , who oversees the pet program at @entity4			1
the pet travel frenzy has spurred the creation of an airline catering exclusively to pets			1
this month , @entity58 , the nation 's first pet - only airline , will begin flying in five major cities , including @entity62 and @entity63 , @entity64			1
it 's an alternative to shipping larger pets in the cargo area of a plane , where there have been pet injuries and even deaths			1
chart : compare some of the common airline fees " the owners can check a bag with them , " explained @entity73 , a spokeswoman for @entity58			1
" or if they have a special blanket or toy , basically anything that will take stress out of traveling			0
" on each @entity58 flight , services include potty breaks and experienced animal handlers checking up on the animals every 15 minutes			1
nervous parents can track their pets online			2
@entity88 was the latest airline to join the pet - loving bandwagon in may , when it permitted small dogs and cats to travel in the cabin area			1
the pets must sit in an approved kennel that fits under the seat			2
" i was n't going to fly @entity88 , " said @entity98 , 37 , of @entity99 , @entity100 , who is mom to a friendly 18 - pound @entity101 that resembles @entity102 from " @entity103 " since the airline has changed its policy , she plans to take her puppy on a @entity88 flight to @entity64 this fall			2
" i 'm so glad now that she will be able to go with me			0
" each year , airlines transport hundreds of thousands of pets in the cargo and cabin areas			1
@entity113 reported moving 270,000 pets last year in cabin and cargo , more than triple the number moved before the airline 's pet program officially kicked off eight years ago			1
the @entity119 does n't have restrictions on whether animals can be in the cabin area , but airlines must allow service dogs for the disabled on board			1
only cats and dogs are allowed in the cabin areas on most airlines			1
in the cargo area , other pets like rabbits , birds and lizards can be stowed			2
the cost of flying your furry friend ranges from $ 75 to nearly $ 300 each leg			2
it 's a hefty price tag , but profit - bleeding airlines are happy to offer the option			2
pets can even rack up frequent flier miles			0
after three flights with @entity14 , the pet can earn a fourth flight free			0
@entity113 and @entity150 ' programs credit the pet 's trip on the owner 's frequent flier account			1
but one airline is catering to allergy - ridden customers who do n't want pets in the cabin			1
last year , @entity159 banned pets from the cabin area because officials said pet allergies are common among their customers			1
@entity165 , a 63 - year - old teacher in @entity166 , @entity167 , experienced continuous wheezing on a four - hour @entity170 flight to @entity171 , @entity172			0
at the end of the flight , she was shocked to find that there had been a cat sitting under her seat			0
" what would have happened if i went into an attack at 35,000 feet in the air ? " she asked			0
in 2008 , the @entity182 wrote letters to @entity184 expressing concern about pets riding in the cabin area after some patients became ill from their flights			1
the letters did n't go very far , officials said			0
airlines say they have had few allergy injuries on board			0
the airlines limit the number of pets in the cargo area to about five			1
the aircraft is disinfected and cleaned routinely , so dander and hairs are n't a problem , airline officials say			0
but not every traveler has had smooth experiences with pets on board			0
@entity207 , a travel expert , recalls an unpleasant incident years ago when a dog had diarrhea three rows in front of him			0
" you could certainly smell it , " he wrote in an e-mail			0
" the only real way to solve the problem is no pets in the cabin			1

most airlines allow small pets to ride in crates in the cabin for a fee
@entity58 will fly to five cities , transporting pets only
