-- prince @entity1 is currently in @entity2 awaiting an improvement in weather conditions so that he , along with his fellow walking with the wounded teammates , can fly to @entity8 's @entity7 and begin acclimating their bodies to the extreme conditions before their 200 - mile trek to the @entity13			1
by committing to head to the bottom of the earth alongside his team , @entity1 is setting a whole new precedent in terms of royal charity involvement for the future			1
members of the royal family serve to provide continuity , promote @entity27 interests , and act as global ambassadors by representing all that is great about @entity30 , but a large percentage of their operational life is devoted to charity work			1
for decades royals have travelled the length and breadth of the country , and indeed the globe , on behalf of their many organizations			0
they act as patron or president , raise awareness of the cause , cut ribbons , unveil plaques , attend dinners , plant trees , and most importantly -- raise money			0
a royal patronage is about the best gift a charity can receive short of a wealthy benefactor bequeathing millions of dollars to the cause on their death bed , and in times of recession and economic hardship the survival of many charities rests on the regal shoulders of its patron			0
at 87 the @entity63 has more than 600 patronages and at 92 prince @entity65 has about 800			1
according to a recent @entity68 article , prince @entity66 raised $ 224 million for his charities between april 2012 and march 2013			0
tickets to the upcoming @entity71 on behalf of homeless charity @entity72 were going for the princely sum of Â £ 500 before selling out almost immediately			0
the reason for the large price tag and instant sell out ? prince @entity77 , patron of @entity72 , will be in attendance			1
charities can command top dollar when a senior royal rolls out			0
along with said royal comes a legion of reporters and wealthy benefactors , and whenever @entity87 's involved you can pretty much guarantee the occasion making front page news the following day			0
that type of attention leaves charity heads googly - eyed			2
the royals have always approached charity engagements with enthusiasm , well aware that their presence allows for worldwide exposure			2
one need only to look at coverage of @entity100 shaking hands with an @entity103 patient in 1989 , or her walk through a partially - cleared land mine field in @entity106 in 1997 , to understand the power of a globally recognized figure			0
@entity77 and @entity1 , however , have taken things one step further in recent years by rolling up their proverbial sleeves and throwing themselves in at ground level			1
in december 2009 prince @entity77 spent the night sleeping rough near @entity114 in central @entity115			1
he did so in order to gain a better understanding of what the homeless community experiences night after night			0
had he simply dished out soup and shaken hands with a few volunteers he still would have drawn attention to the work of the charity @entity72 , but by actually bedding down on the streets of @entity115 he significantly heightened public awareness			2
in march 2011 prince @entity1 joined a team of injured servicemen for the first five days of their trek to the @entity132			1
yes , of course it was about raising money for the charity walking with @entity137 , but as @entity1 said at the time , it was also about raising an awareness of the debt the country owes to those it sends off to fight			1
@entity1 has made no secret of his dedication to the welfare of injured servicemen and women , and the money raised enables the charity to fulfill its mission ; however , by taking part alongside his fellow soldiers , @entity1 gave them far more than a well - funded charity			1
he showed them that they matter , that their loss matters , and that their lives may continue to inspire			2
looking to the future of the monarchy , @entity66 has made it clear he wants to push for a more streamlined royal family , but i hope that when the time comes he will make room for extended members of the family to step up and continue their efforts on behalf of their chosen charities			2
as the only blood - born princesses of their generation , @entity171 and @entity172 have already shown a readiness to support causes meaningful to them			0
were the @entity63 to give them an " official " role , their potential could be enormous			2
it comes down to simple mathematics : streamline the monarchy , and funding to the smaller charities that rely on a royal patron slips down the tubes			0
royals and charity work will always go hand - in - hand -- and long may it be so			1
plaques will remain , trees will grow , and the work of the charity in question will continue , but it is this new hardcore approach that is so exciting			2
it wo n't work for everyone , and it would lose its impact if suddenly every engagement required rigorous training , compression chambers , hard hats , life vests and the likes , but we should salute prince @entity1 on his epic polar endeavor			1
@entity1 's physical disability may be limited to a broken toe , but walking alongside those brave wounded warriors will no doubt leave him with an unbreakable spirit			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			0

prince @entity1 is in @entity2 waiting to continue preparing for a 200 - mile trek to the @entity13
