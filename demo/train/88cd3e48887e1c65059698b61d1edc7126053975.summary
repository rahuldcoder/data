on friday , a military jury decided @entity2 staff sgt. @entity1 will get life in prison without parole for killing 16 @entity7 villagers			1
yet victims left behind -- some bearing physical scars , others with emotional ones from seeing their kin indiscriminately , brutally gunned down -- say that , with that sentence , they do n't feel they got justice			1
friday 's decision was not entirely unexpected			0
in june @entity16 ' pleaded guilty to more than 30 criminal charges , including 16 premeditated murder counts , spared himself from the prospect of a death sentence			1
he also pleaded guilty to charges related to illicit steroid and alcohol use			1
but it still remained up to a jury of four officers and two enlisted personnel to decide whether @entity16 should be eligible for parole			1
they decided friday he is not , according to lt. col. @entity33 with @entity34			0
that means the 39 - year - old will spend the rest of his life in a military prison			0
that 's not punishment enough for @entity42			0
now 40 , @entity42 was inside his home in the @entity45 district of @entity7 's southern @entity47 province in the pre-dawn hours of march 11 , 2012 , when @entity16 barged in			1
what followed was a nightmare , ending with bloodied , limp and in some instances scorched bodies			0
" we wanted this murderer to be executed , but we did n't get our wish , " @entity42 said through an interpreter friday from the @entity53 @entity2 base where the sentence was handed down			1
the sentence was not just , he added , before appealing to the @entity61 public to put themselves in his shoes			1
" i 'm asking the average @entity61 right here : if somebody jumps into your house in the middle of the night and kills 11 members of your family and tries to burn them , what punishment would you be passing on that person ? " @entity42 and his family were n't the only ones torn on that horrific morning some 18 months ago			1
@entity16 slipped away from @entity75 , the remote outpost where he was stationed , and into one village , where he began shooting at civilians			1
after that , he returned to the base , reloaded and went out again to target another village			0
he left a trail of blood and gore in both villages , with nine children among the dead			0
witnesses claimed that the @entity61 soldier dragged some bodies of his victims ' outside and set them ablaze			2
the horror ended when @entity16 returned , once again , to @entity75 and turned himself in			2
in the subsequent hours and days , some spoke highly about @entity16 , such as attorney @entity95 who described him as a " devoted husband , father and dedicated member of the armed service			2
" yet in @entity7 and around the world , the massacre quickly spurred outrage			2
the @entity103 vowed to retaliate " by killing and beheading @entity61 anywhere in the country			2
" @entity7 president @entity106 suggested , after meeting with villagers who 'd seen the carnage and wanted @entity16 to be tried there to " heal our broken hearts , " that the incident had put @entity61 - @entity7 relations at a breaking point			1
" it is by all means the end of the rope here , " @entity106 said then			0
" the end of the rope that nobody can afford such luxuries anymore			0
" @entity16 was identified as the culprit days later and eventually put in solitary confinement at the @entity61 military prison in @entity127 , @entity128			1
the military announced last december that @entity16 faced a court - martial			2
the @entity2 soldier spoke at this week 's sentencing , calling what he 'd done " an act of cowardice			0
" " i hid behind a mask of @entity142 , " @entity16 said , according to a tweet from court from @entity138 of @entity140 affiliate king			2
also admitting he 'd taken steroids and drank sporadically , the soldier apologized to his victims			0
" i am responsible , " he said			0
because of him , some in @entity7 are still suffering the consequences			2
haji @entity148 saw @entity16 come into his southwest @entity7 home around 2 a.m. and kill women there , as well as some of his children			1
bullets struck him in the neck and the face			0
that incident and others in which @entity61 soldiers have killed civilians -- including another of @entity148 's sons , in a separate incident , he says -- have disgraced @entity61 forces in the eyes of many @entity7			1
children in his village used to run toward @entity61 troops , @entity148 said ; now , they " run away and try to hide			2
" if @entity61 is to improve its image , there must be accountability , he said			0
and if @entity53 wants to help rebuild @entity7 , " try to send the right people , not maniacs and psychos like ( @entity16 )			1
" still , even if the @entity61 governments acts differently , some pain and suffering ca n't be undone			1
recalling tears shed by @entity16 ' mother during the legal proceedings , @entity148 said , " but at least she can go and visit him			0
" what about us ? " he asked rhetorically			0
" our family members are actually 6 feet under , and there 's no way that we can visit them at all			0

" we did n't get our wish , " says an @entity7 whose relatives were killed
another says @entity61 has lost *credibility* , support in @entity7
staff sgt. @entity195 dead 16 @entity7 civilians before turning himself in
@entity16 pleaded guilty in june , sparing him the prospect of a death sentence
