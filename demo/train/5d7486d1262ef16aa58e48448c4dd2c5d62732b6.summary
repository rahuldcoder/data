-- if austerity had been a clinical trial , it would have been stopped			1
as public health experts , we have watched aghast as a slow motion disaster arose from austerity policies in @entity8 , while politicians continue to ignore the evidence of their disastrous effects			1
@entity12 was designed to shrink debts			0
now , three years after @entity8 's budget - cutting began , the evidence is in : severe , indiscriminate austerity is not part of the solution , but part of the problem -- and its human costs are devastating			1
in the @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , the @entity27 and elsewhere in @entity8 there were more than 10,000 additional suicides from 2007 - 2010 , a figure that is over and above historical trends , with the largest rises concentrated in the worst performing economies			1
but suicides and depression are not unavoidable consequences of economic downturns : countries that slashed health and social protection budgets have seen starkly worse health outcomes than nations which opted for stimulus over austerity			1
@entity24 , for example , is in the middle of a public health disaster			1
to meet budget - deficit reduction targets set by the @entity49 , @entity50 , and @entity51 ( the so - called troika ) , @entity24 's public health budget has been cut by more than 40 %			1
as @entity24 's health minister observed , " these are n't cuts with a scalpel , they 're cuts with a butcher 's knife			1
" the spending was reduced to 6 % of @entity60 , a figure lower than the @entity27 , at 8 % , and @entity62 , at 9 %			0
as a result , hiv infections have jumped by more than 200 % since 2010 , concentrated in injection drug users , as needle - exchange program budgets were cut in half			0
there was a malaria epidemic in @entity24 -- the largest in 40 years -- after mosquito - spraying budgets were slashed			1
more than 200 essential medicines have been de-stocked from some pharmacies as the state 's drug budget was reduced and pharmaceuticals companies exited the country in arrears			0
since 2008 there has been a rise of more than 40 % of people who report being unable to access healthcare that they believe to be medically necessary , the majority concentrated in pensioners			0
as patients can not afford private care and forego preventive care , public sector hospitals have experienced a 24 % rise in hospital admissions			0
doctors and clinics are therefore overstrained			0
infant mortality rates have risen 40 % between 2008 and 2010			1
over 35,000 public health workers , nurses , and doctors have lost jobs			1
unemployment rates have hit 27 % and youth unemployment has jumped to near 75 % in some areas			1
with little hope for the future , desperate people are turning to cheap , synthetic drugs			0
use of anti-depressants has skyrocketed , adding costs to the healthcare system			0
suicide rates , previously among the lowest in @entity8 , have soared			1
were these all inevitable consequences of recession , rather than consequences of austerity ? of course the @entity24 financial and political elites have made mistakes			1
and of course @entity24 's fiscal and monetary options were severely restricted as part of the bailout deals			1
but the suffering of the @entity24 was not inevitable			1
the timing of many of these health effects coincided not with the onset of recession in 2008 and 2009 , but with the implementation of deep budget cuts starting in 2010			2
several prevailing myths are commonly offered as alternative explanations for @entity24 's devastating health outcomes , including these three : the first myth : " @entity24 's healthcare system is excessive and inefficient			1
" but there are just five hospital beds in @entity24 per 1,000 people , versus more than eight beds per 1,000 people in @entity62			1
the second myth : " @entity24 are lazy			1
" but in 2011 the average @entity24 citizen worked 2,038 hours per year -- 600 hours more than the average @entity141 , according to the @entity142			1
the third myth : " @entity8 's bailout money is being squandered			0
" but bailout money is not flowing in to support @entity24 's healthcare system -- it is instead circulating back to large international banks in @entity62 , @entity147 and the @entity27			1
what we learned from analyzing past crises is that people do not inevitably get sick or die because the economy has faltered			2
fiscal policy can be a matter of life and death			0
during the @entity158 in the @entity23 in the 1930s , mortality rates actually fell by about 10 %			2
even though suicide rates increased among the unemployed between 1929 and 1933 , this increase was outweighed by short - term drops in road traffic deaths , as people drove less to save on fuel costs			1
then , at a time when total debt was over 200 % of gdp , president @entity166 implemented the @entity169 , which created the @entity23 social safety net			0
@entity169 programs to re-house people who lost their homes , help people return to work , and build a public health infrastructure were highly effective -- and each additional $ 100 per capita in @entity169 spending reduced suicides by 4 per 100,000 and infant deaths by about 18 per 100,000			1
tuberculosis rates also fell , but disease rates were substantially reduced in those states that aggressively implemented the @entity169 rather than those avoiding its implementation -- a " natural experiment			2
" 1934 , the year after the @entity169 started becoming effective , marked the beginning of the @entity23 economic recovery			0
another " natural experiment " occurred in the aftermath of the @entity188 from 1997 to 1998			0
@entity190 , @entity191 , and @entity192 all had large market crashes : their currencies plummeted , @entity60 collapsed , and unemployment soared			0
but their politicians responded differently to the crisis , creating a rare laboratory in which we can identify the health effects of economic policy			2
@entity190 and @entity191 turned to the @entity51 for help , implementing deep cuts to its @entity206 prevention , whereas @entity192 charted a different path , investing in preventive measures during the crisis			0
@entity190 and @entity191 suffered large pneumonia and tuberculosis outbreaks , but @entity192 avoided these effects			0
turning to the current recession in @entity8 , @entity213 is another case study revealing that there is an alternative to austerity			2
five years ago its three largest banks failed , and their total debt rocketed to over 800 % of gdp			0
it was the largest banking crisis in history relative to the size of an economy and it forced @entity213 to turn to the @entity51 for help			2
the troika 's bailout plan called for reductions in spending equivalent to 50 % of the budget in order to finance bank bailouts			0
the health minister resigned in protest at plans to cut the healthcare budget by 30 % , as detailed in our book			2
then the president of @entity213 took a radical step : asking the people what they wanted to do			0
in march 2010 , 93 % of the @entity213 people voted against financing a bailout for foreign savers of @entity248 through draconian budget cuts			0
instead , @entity213 stabilized healthcare spending			0
thanks to this boost to the nation 's universal healthcare system , no one lost access to healthcare even as the cost of imported medicines rose as an effect of the devaluation of the @entity262			0
there was no significant rise in suicides or depression			2
nor were there any significant infectious disease outbreaks			0
indeed , last year gdp growth was 2.7 % , and unemployment rates have fallen below 5 %			2
having seen the results , the @entity51 turned tail , praising @entity213 's successful approach			0
each of these crises -- @entity275 , the @entity277 financial crisis , and @entity213 's bank meltdown -- had different origins , but they led to potentially similar health threats			2
but their contrasting outcomes support our conclusion that an economic crisis does not inevitably increase in death and disability			0
the real danger is austerity			2
but if austerity is not working , and indeed is part of the problem ( as the @entity51 has recently admitted ) , why are @entity291 leaders continuing its pursuit ? @entity27 economist @entity296 indirectly outlined the dangers of austerity in 1919			2
@entity62 's unpayable debt from @entity300 , he argued , exacted by @entity291 nations in the @entity302 , would cause economic collapse and , ultimately , social instability in @entity62			0
tragically , his premonition was borne out : @entity62 's deep austerity under " hunger chancellor " @entity308 as it struggled to repay debts to @entity147 , @entity310 , and the @entity23 fueled the rise of the @entity312 and , as some historians argue , ultimately @entity314 in @entity8			1
in the aftermath of that war , @entity62 benefited from the @entity23 - sponsored @entity317 , whereby @entity23 injected $ 1.45 billion in funds to invest in @entity141 industry and rebuild vital infrastructure			0
the @entity317 's stimulus package helped spur recovery , paving the way for decades of prosperity and peace in @entity8			2
collectively we seem to be losing sight of the lessons from our past			1
in @entity24 , austerity packages in @entity8 are sparking the rising popularity of neo-nazi parties , such as @entity333			1
but there is an alternative			0
in 2009 , the @entity141 parliament approved a 50 billion euros stimulus package to spur growth			2
across @entity8 we have found that economies that introduced greater stimulus investment have charted faster economic recoveries			1
thanks to smart investments in " active labor market programs " â € ” programs that help people access job retraining and return to work quickly -- @entity62 , @entity348 and @entity213 have mitigated rises in depression and suicides from unemployment			1
our research has found that each euro invested in public health can yield up to a three euros return if invested wisely in data - supported government programs			1
@entity358 officials learned this lesson in the early 1990s -- after restricting its @entity362 prevention budget , the city suffered a drug - resistant @entity362 outbreak that ultimately cost $ 1.2 billion to control , about 10 times greater than the estimated price of prevention			0
@entity24 's @entity206 , @entity362 , and malaria epidemics will now cost more to control than they would have been to prevent , our research indicates			1
what we have learned is that severe , indiscriminate cuts to vital social protection programs are not only economically self - defeating , but fatal .			0

health experts @entity373 and @entity374 say that if austerity had been a clinical trial , it would have been stopped
they have analyzed how austerity *affects* health and have found it drives up suicide , depression and illness rates
they say the suffering of @entity24 is not inevitable , with history showing stimulus can work better than austerity
the *authors* argue the world has *forgotten* lessons from the past , and this is proving fatal
