" we will play an essential role in promoting strong partnerships that strengthen the capabilities of the @entity22 nations to defend and secure themselves , " @entity2 said			1
asked if helping the militaries of regional allies would raise the potential for conflict , @entity2 said , " i do n't think we should take the attitude that just because we improve their capabilities that we are asking for more trouble			1
" @entity2 said the @entity3 should " do everything we can " to help those countries defend themselves , but at the same time , the @entity3 would " encourage them ... to abide by an international set of rules and standards and order			1
" why the @entity9 are flocking to @entity3 colleges the increased regional involvement by the @entity3 has raised concerns about tensions with @entity9 and suggestions it represents a threat to @entity9			2
" i reject that view entirely , " @entity2 said , calling the @entity3 shift " fully compatible with the development and growth of @entity9			1
indeed , increased @entity3 involvement in this region will benefit @entity9			0
" @entity2 said the @entity3 will work to improve communication with @entity9 with an aim to " build trust " between the two nations			1
looming over the discussions in @entity0 is the conflict between @entity9 and various regional nations -- such as the @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 -- over the @entity45			2
@entity104 discusses his next moves the @entity45 , nicknamed " the second @entity106 " because of its potential for massive oil and gas reserves , is also a key passageway for the world 's oil and is home to enormously valuable fisheries			2
a crisis in the area has the potential for major economic damage to the @entity3 as well			2

on the other side of the @entity3 - @entity6 strategy is an emphasis on building the @entity3 - @entity9 relationship			1

he said the @entity3 was " clear eyed " about its relationship with @entity9			0

" " we have also agreed on the need to address responsible behavior in cyberspace and in outer space , " @entity2 added			0
@entity2 said he plans to visit @entity9 sometime this summer			0
the @entity3 decision to play a larger role in @entity6 comes against the backdrop of rising military spending in that region while the @entity3 trims its own military in the face of massive deficits			1
defense spending in @entity6 has been projected to surpass @entity181 's this year			2
" there is no doubt that it will continue to increase in the future , " @entity2 said			0
to offset @entity3 budget realities , the @entity3 will " sharpen the technological edge of our forces , " @entity2 said			2

" under required budget cuts by @entity207 , the @entity205 must reduce the planned budget by nearly half a trillion dollars over the next decade			0

also present at the conference , @entity3 @entity220 sen. @entity220 said @entity3 budget cuts will affect the outlined @entity6 strategy			1
" at some point , and i think we are at that point , we will not be able to carry out the commitments , " @entity220 told reporters			0
he said money for additional ships could be found by spending less on the redeployment of @entity3 marines out of @entity233 , @entity134 , and by getting the " cost , waste and mismanagement " of weapons systems in the @entity205 under control .			0
