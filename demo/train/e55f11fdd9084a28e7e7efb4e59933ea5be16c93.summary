men affiliated with terrorist organizations have crossed the @entity5 ' southern border and the @entity6 is splitting hairs by arguing otherwise , a @entity1 @entity0 is saying			1
rep. @entity8 , a @entity9 @entity0 who made headlines this week by claiming that @entity13 officers had told him at least 10 @entity15 terror suspects had been captured crossing the border , backtracked friday on his comments about their affiliation			1
but he said he stands by his claim that terrorists have entered the country			0
" i should have been more careful talking about @entity15 , as opposed to terrorist @entity25 or terrorist @entity26 , " @entity8 told @entity22 after an event in his district			1
@entity8 said he still wo n't reveal the source of his claim that at least 10 terror suspects have been caught , but that it came from " folks that are on the ground " and not homeland security secretary @entity30 or any other appointees of president @entity32			0
" the question is , is the administration parsing language when they say no actual @entity15 fighters -- meaning guys in black pajamas with black flags and ak - 47s -- have gotten across the border ? " @entity8 said			2
" what you have are people from terrorist countries , state sponsors of terrorism , that have in fact gotten across the border , " he said			0
his comments came after @entity5 officials acknowledged that four @entity25 nationals who had crossed into @entity57 were captured on september 10 -- and that at least one had said he is affiliated with the @entity59 , also known as the @entity59			2

he said he did n't know whether @entity8 's claims about at least 10 @entity15 - affiliated terror suspects crossing into the @entity5 are accurate , but that " to suggest that a terrorist , a person with @entity15 , would never do so would be naive			1
