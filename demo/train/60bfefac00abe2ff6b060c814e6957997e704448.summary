-- formula one world championship leader @entity1 believes it is too early to start thinking about winning the title despite having a 14 - point lead with only three races left			1
the main rivals to the @entity9 driver are his teammate @entity10 and @entity12 's @entity11 , who are tied for second in the standings			1
@entity16 pair @entity15 and reigning champion @entity17 are also still in contention for the crown			1
@entity1 knows he will become champion if he wins one of the season 's remaining races and scores podium finishes in the other two , with trips to @entity26 and @entity27 finishing off this year 's calendar			1
the @entity30 driver told the official @entity32 website : " it 's ridiculous to start calculating things because a lot of things can happen			1
" i win the next two races , it 's all over anyway in terms of doing well			2
but this is another event , another race here and ( i must ) keep doing what i 'm doing			2
" " the ( points ) gap has been edging away , the right way in the last few races			2
i need to try to do that			2
then just keep doing our best , that 's the most important thing			2
i 'm doing my best and then hopefully the result will take care of itself			0
" @entity11 has made a big impression in his first season with @entity12 and will take away the positives even if he can not land the title for the third time			1
" in terms of happiness , in terms of motivation , driving , the team itself , it 's the best one			0
obviously it will be nice to become champion this year but even if we can not do it , i will anyway have great , great memories of 2010			1
" @entity17 and 2008 champion @entity15 know they have to make up ground fast at the @entity74 this weekend			1
@entity17 , who is fifth in the rankings , is aware of how difficult it will be for him to close the 31 - point gap between himself and @entity1 , but he is excited to still be involved in the fight for the sport 's top prize			1
" it is good to still be involved in the championship hunt with three races to go , " said @entity17			0
" obviously it 's most difficult for me as i am 31 points behind			0
but there is always a possibility			0
" we are still very hopeful and i am looking forward to the next three races			0
i am sure it is going to be pretty mixed up as we go through these next three races			0
that will make an exciting fight for the end of the season			2
" his fellow @entity95 , who at present finds himself in fourth place , was also in bullish mood , despite trailing the @entity98 and @entity12 in recent races			1
" i think it 's possible , anything 's possible			0
" i think you can tell that us , as a team , and the @entity104 as well , are pushing very hard because i do n't think the gap is that big , so it 's not impossible			0
i 'm happy where i am , we 're still in the fight for the championship , so it 's not a bad position to be in			0
" with doubts being cast over @entity74 's ability to host the event , @entity10 , who won the last round in @entity112 , is pleased with what he has seen so far			1
" i think the main things have been covered			0
we will see how grippy it will be , but given the fact there was a lot of concern and we were even talking about not racing here , lately they did a very good job			0

@entity1 thinks it is too soon to talk about winning the @entity32 world title
@entity11 claims the 2010 season has been the happiest of his career
@entity15 is confident @entity16 can *compete* with the @entity98 and @entity12 in @entity74
