@entity0 -- in what resembled more a revival than a political rally , conservative talk show host @entity2 urged the large crowds at his " @entity9 " event saturday to " turn back to @entity10 " and return @entity11 to the values on which it was founded			1
" something beyond imagination is happening , " he told participants who packed the @entity15 in @entity0			0
" @entity11 today begins to turn back to @entity10			1
for too long , this country has wandered in darkness			0
" the rally drew fire for its timing and location			0
people filled the park by the @entity27 's reflecting pool , in the shadows and echoes of the most pivotal civil rights address in @entity11 's history -- the rev. @entity32 's famous " @entity34 " speech , which he delivered there 47 years ago			1
some of those who marched with @entity32 said @entity2 had usurped the day for his own political gain			1
the rev. @entity37 told @entity1 that @entity2 was mimicking @entity32 and " humiliating the tradition			1
" other civil rights activists gathered nearby with the rev. @entity40 and his @entity41 in a " @entity43 " rally			1
participants marched from a high school in northwest @entity0 , to the site of the future @entity48 , just a few blocks from the @entity27			0
@entity2 said the site of his rally was appropriate to reflect on the legacy of @entity32 , " the man who stood down on those stairs and gave his life for everyone 's right to have a dream			1
" a hero to many conservative voters across the country , @entity2 said his rally was nonpolitical and its mission was to honor @entity64 troops			1
he struck a spiritual tone throughout the day , saying his role was to wake @entity11 up to the backsliding of principles , values and most importantly , faith			1
earlier , he said " @entity10 dropped a giant sandbag on his head " to push him to organize the event			1
look to @entity10 and make your choice , " he said			2
" do we no longer believe in the power of the individual ? do we no longer believe in dreams ? " @entity2 , keenly aware of his critics , opened the rally shortly after 10 a.m. with the national anthem and immediately drew attention to the large crowd that stretched for six city blocks from the @entity27 along the parks surrounding the reflecting pool			1
" i have just gotten word from the media that there are over 1,000 people here today , " @entity2 said sarcastically			1
" we are humbled that you are here , " he said			0
" the reflecting pool holds about 200,000 people			0
this field back here holds about 250 - to 300,000 people			0
they are not only full here , they 're full in that field , they 're full behind me , and they are now across the street approaching the @entity108			0
" @entity110 activists from across the country attended the event			0
speakers included former @entity115 gov. @entity114 , a @entity117 contributor , who said she came to speak not about politics but as " something more " -- as the mother of a soldier			0
she said @entity11 's men and women in uniform exemplified the virtues and values of @entity11			1
" say what you want to say about me , but i raised a combat vet and you ca n't take that away from me , " she said to a crowd that broke out in chants of " @entity11 ! @entity11 ! " she also noted the anniversary of the famous civil rights speech , saying , " we feel the spirit of dr. @entity32 " " we are so honored to stand here today , " @entity114 added			1
rally organizers said saturday 's event was not political and asked participants not to carry signs , unlike past @entity110 demonstrations			1
the atmosphere saturday was almost festival - like and participants were careful to say : " we 're not angry			0
" @entity145 of @entity146 , @entity147 , described herself as not conservative but someone who feels that her beliefs are no longer reflected in government			0
" i believe that we are dysfunctional as a country , " she said			0
" i believe it 's hopeless unless we get back to our roots , " @entity145 added			2
" and that means our faith , and it means , reorganize our time			0
we have been so busy earning a living and raising our children that we have let different small groups overpower our opinions			0
and we 're here to ... reclaim what 's wonderful about this country			0
" @entity2 had been heavily promoting the event on his @entity117 program and on his radio broadcasts			1
he said that the timing of the rally was n't intentional			0
" it was not my intention to select 8 - 28 because of the @entity32 tie			2
it is the day he made that speech			2
i had no idea until i announced it , " he said on his radio show in june , soon after the announcement of the rally			2
" whites do n't own @entity181			0
blacks do n't own @entity32			2
those are @entity64 icons , @entity64 ideas , and we should just talk about character , and that 's really what this event is about			1
it 's about honoring character , " @entity2 said			1
@entity192 , a niece of the late civil rights leader , also participated in the " @entity9 " rally , saying that her uncle would have approved of the event			1
" if @entity199 could be here today , he would sure commend us of giving honor where honor is due , " she told a large , cheering crowd			2
@entity32 said earlier she 's been accused of hijacking " the dream , " but on @entity1 's " @entity204 " on friday night , she said " the dream " is in her genes			1
" i do n't have to reclaim the civil rights movement , i 'm part of the civil rights movement , " she said , noting her family 's home and her father 's church were bombed when she was younger			1
while the @entity215 put out a cautious statement regarding the rally , there has been plenty of criticism of the event			2
@entity220 , an @entity221 , was asked by the @entity110 to speak at saturday 's rally but declined			2
he said the rally was disrespectful to the rev. @entity32 " i can not sit on stage and co-sign on this irresponsibility , " he said			1
" i made sure i wore my elephant pin today			0
i am a proud @entity227 but i am also a proud @entity64 man			0
" but @entity228 , another black @entity221 , said he supported @entity2 's efforts			2
" go @entity2 , " he said			2
" this is a fantastic rally and the people there do n't give a hoot about race			0
" @entity1 's @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237 contributed to this report .			0
