-- despite @entity3 's intention that the modern @entity4 should promote a " spirit of friendship " among nations , the @entity1 have never been as immune to the wider currents of international affairs as their founder had hoped			0
@entity13 water polo player @entity11 is covered in blood in the 1956 match against the @entity16			1
few sporting encounters however have been as loaded with political symbolism as @entity13 's water polo semifinal against the @entity16 in @entity20 in 1956			1
the @entity13 @entity4 team had left for @entity22 shortly after the beginning of the uprising that would briefly topple their country 's hardline communist rulers			2
from the other side of the world they watched as @entity16 tanks rolled toward @entity32 , crushing the new regime under their tracks			1
protesters were gunned down in the street , while thousands were imprisoned and executed , including @entity38 , the leader of the ill - fated revolt whose withdrawal of @entity13 from the @entity41 and declaration of neutrality had prompted @entity16 intervention			1
with the @entity46 -- already divided over the @entity48 crisis and unwilling to risk an escalation of @entity51 hostilities -- powerless to act , @entity13 's @entity4 team became an icon of their country 's doomed struggle for freedom			1
one night early in the @entity1 , the red star in the center of the communist @entity13 flag that flew over the @entity4 village was ripped out and replaced with the @entity61 -- a defiant symbol of @entity13 independence			0
it was , therefore , spectacularly inappropriate that @entity13 and the @entity16 should meet in something so trivial as a water polo match when their compatriots had been involved so recently in real battles on the streets of @entity32			1
for @entity13 's players , however , @entity4 champions in 1952 , the match represented a chance to strike a blow against their oppressors			1
" in the strained political situation we were in , it was a body - to - body encounter with our opponents , " recalled @entity13 player @entity77			2
" now i have to admit that i 'm convinced even the referee was pulling for us			0
we were from a small country battling the huge @entity85			0
" charged atmosphere played in front of a packed stadium , mainly occupied by @entity13 - born @entity22 , the atmosphere was charged from the start			2
when @entity91 caught a @entity16 player on the chin with his fist -- by accident or design -- as he wound up to shoot @entity13 in front , the crowd cheered both the goal and the outbreak of hostilities			2
@entity13 continued to dominate in the water , with star player @entity11 scoring twice , but the temperature of the match rose steadily in a series of violent clashes			0
when @entity107 , the water stained red around him , was forced to leave the pool bleeding badly from a facial wound , the encounter reached boiling point			0
the match was abandoned as the crowd spilled down to the pool side and the violence looked set to escalate into the stands			0
@entity13 , who led 4 - 0 , were awarded victory while the @entity118 left with a police escort			1
@entity13 went on to collect the gold medal , yet any satisfaction the team may have felt was tempered by the knowledge that many of them had already decided that they could not go home			0
most chose exile in @entity22 and the @entity128 , rather than returning to a country that they no longer recognized as their own .			0

@entity13 and the @entity16 had been *invovled* in real battles in @entity32
the match was a chance for @entity13 's players to strike at their opposers
@entity13 led 4 - 0 and were awarded victory
