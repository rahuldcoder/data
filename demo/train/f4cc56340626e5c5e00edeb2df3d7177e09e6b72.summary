-- if we can put a man on the moon ... i see it every day , the wonderment in the eyes of young children as they walk into the museum			1
they marvel at the pockmarked @entity12 command module or the shininess of the @entity15 lunar module or the massive scale of the @entity17			1
for them , nearly five decades later , anything is still possible			0
forty - five years after the crew of @entity12 landed on the moon , millennials have now reached adulthood -- just as the baby boomers did in the 1960s -- and their kids still see hope in the stars			1
this historic anniversary shines through the decades , as a watershed of @entity32 ingenuity , determination and spirit			0
at the @entity38 's @entity37 , our visitors remind us every day that these qualities endure , as entwined as ever with progress in aviation , spaceflight and planetary science			1
since our opening during the nation 's @entity46 in 1976 , more than 325 million people have visited			2
the establishment in 2003 of our second location in suburban @entity51 , the @entity48 -- where the @entity17 is now located -- has increased our patronage			0
we are recognized as the country 's most visited museum			2
what is it about the history and science of flight that appeals to so many , transcending age and cultural biases ? public reaction to the moon landing offers clues			1
more than anything , it represented infinite potential			1
it was the first time in history that humans set foot on another body			0
it was an @entity32 endeavor , but a worldwide triumph			0
the @entity76 mission less than a year earlier set the stage for this powerful and galvanizing achievement because it inspired people to view the planet earth in a new way			0
when its crew in lunar orbit focused cameras on @entity80 , humanity saw its home for the first time from far away , a small " blue marble " hanging in the blackness of space			2
so when @entity91 set foot on the moon 's surface in the summer of 1969 , humanity recognized in an unambiguous way that the exploration of space was possible , achievable and inevitable			1
this recognition continues to inspire and motivate us , and will for decades to come			0
as the home of @entity91 's spacesuit , the @entity12 command module @entity102 , and thousands of other artifacts related to aviation and space , we see firsthand how viewing these objects , and learning the stories behind them , resonates with children and people of all ages			1
our mission -- to commemorate , educate and inspire -- applies not only to the artifacts we preserve , but also to the research we conduct in aeronautics , space history and planetary studies			2
the work our curators and scientists do serves as the foundation for exhibitions , programs , books , educational activities , online offerings , and live and broadcast programs			0
in the 21st century , our mission extends far beyond our walls , to reach the global community			0
for those of us 50 and older , the anniversary of the moon landing will undoubtedly bring to mind the memory of what we were doing when @entity91 stated those memorable words " one small step for ( a ) man ; one giant leap for mankind			1
" we watched the event on television , looked up at the moon , and half expected to see @entity91 and @entity146 's movements from @entity80			1
for younger people who have never known a life where @entity32 were not exploring space , who have followed the magnificent achievements of the space shuttle era and progress on the @entity155 , they know our adventure is still ongoing , one they will eventually inherit			2
at the @entity37 , the pride and optimism of @entity12 has n't faded away			1
it endures , living on in the eyes of those kids			0
and now it 's up to them			2
what transforming discoveries will they make in the next 50 years of the space age ? what new technologies and new worlds will become routine for them and their children ? only one feature of spaceflight is inevitable : the unexpected will occur			1
nevertheless , it is that sense of possibility that continues to excite us			0
the sky is no longer the limit			0
join us on @entity181 / @entity180 .			0
