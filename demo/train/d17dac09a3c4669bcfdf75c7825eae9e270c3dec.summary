-- last month , when @entity2 began leaking highly classified documents to the press , many @entity1 were shocked by what they read			1
i do n't blame them			1
for years , the architecture of the programs designed to keep us safe have been a secret to all but a few members of the intelligence community and select legislators			1
the companies that were involved in these programs were under strict gag orders			2
and while members of @entity18 had the opportunity to be briefed on these programs , it would have been a crime , literally , for us to have talked about them publicly			2
as a result , when @entity2 's leaks became public , @entity1 had no way of knowing the scope of these programs , their privacy protections and the legal authorities they were operating under			1
it was just @entity2 and his documents on the one side and the government on the other , saying " trust us			2
" the government must give proper weight to both keeping @entity1 safe from terrorists and protecting @entity1 ' privacy			1
but when @entity1 lack the most basic information about our domestic surveillance programs , they have no way of knowing whether we 're getting that balance right			1
this lack of transparency is a big problem			0
ex-cia chief : what @entity2 did since i came to the @entity48 , i 've been working to fix this			0
i 've supported amendments to the @entity51 and the @entity52 that would have required greater public reporting on the use of surveillance authorities and greater disclosures about the legal opinions and safeguards that support them			1
when those amendments failed , i voted against renewing both of these laws			0
i want to be clear : i did n't vote " no " because i wanted to end these programs or because i thought they were unnecessary			1
based on briefings , i believe these programs protect our country and have saved lives and have reasonable safeguards in place to protect @entity1 ' privacy			1
i voted the way i did because i wanted to send a loud signal to my colleagues that transparency was critical and that there was too little of it in place			0
national security laws must protect national security			0
but they must also protect the public trust and preserve the ability of an informed electorate to hold its government to account			0
i 'm working on legislation that will require the federal government to annually report how it uses key authorities under the @entity51 and the @entity52 , including the authorities underlying the phone metadata and the @entity91 electronic surveillance programs that recently came to light			1
for each of these authorities , the government must disclose how many @entity1 ' information is being collected and how many @entity1 ' information is being queried and actually seen by federal officers or agents			1
my legislation would also allow companies to publicly report on how many @entity51 and @entity52 orders they 're getting and how many of their customers these orders affect			0
there 's a way to do this that protects national security			0
since 2009 , @entity108 has been reporting on the number of national security letters it receives , and that has n't hurt anyone			1
i frankly think that after @entity2 's disclosures , an even stronger case can be made that we can achieve greater transparency without harming national security			0
opinion : @entity119 must protect our privacy from the government as chairman of the @entity125 , a big part of my job is making sure that our privacy laws are keeping up with our technology			2
in 1787 , there was no such thing as a phone , let alone a wiretap			0
and so , almost 50 years ago in a case called @entity133 v. @entity1 , the @entity119 had to determine whether a wiretap constituted a search under the @entity136			1
the court said that it did			0
justices explained that people had come to expect and assume that their calls were private			0
in subsequent cases , the court formally adopted the rule that the @entity136 will protect people where they have an expectation of privacy that society recognizes as reasonable			2
in 2013 , we 're long overdue for another public conversation about what constitutes a reasonable expectation of privacy			2
it 's hard to have that debate around secret programs authorized by secret legal opinions issued by a secret court			2
actually , it 's impossible to have that debate			0
thankfully , public pressure for transparency is building			0
last week , a broad coalition of 63 companies and civil society groups -- from @entity164 to the @entity165 -- sent a letter to the president and congressional leaders calling for the reforms put forward in my bill			2
i think we can pass it			0
ultimately , i suspect that with this information out there , many @entity1 will come to believe that these programs have reasonable safeguards for our civil liberties			1
others will still call for their end or dramatic restructuring			0
i want to let @entity1 decide for themselves			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of sen. @entity185 .			1

@entity185 : @entity1 do n't know scope of surveillance and which authority *oks* it
@entity185 : we need a balance between protecting @entity1 from terror and protecting privacy
we ca n't know if civil liberties are safe if all about surveillance is secret , he says
@entity185 : we need to know who , when and how , to judge if surveillance *crosses* a line
