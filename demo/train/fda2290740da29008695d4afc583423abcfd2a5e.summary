-- @entity2 health officials are recommending that state residents make sure they 're vaccinated against pertussis , a sometimes fatal disease that is on track to sicken more @entity7 this year than at any time in decades			1
" if we continue to have cases in @entity2 at the rate we 've had them so far this year , we 'll have more cases than has been reported for the last 50 years , " said dr. @entity8 , professor of pediatrics at @entity10 and executive director of the @entity12 at @entity13 in @entity14			1
the threat grows when one considers that scientists estimate 10 cases of pertussis , popularly known as whooping cough , occur for every one reported , she said in a telephone interview , adding , " we 're clearly having an epidemic			1
" so far this year , @entity2 has tallied nearly 2,000 cases , two of them fatal , and the total is expected to exceed the 3,358 recorded in 2009 , when the last such outbreak occurred , the @entity29 said			1
there does not appear to be any single explanation for the spike , said @entity34 , a spokesman for the department			0
" it really looks like several things working together , " he said in a telephone interview , noting that outbreaks tend to occur in cycles			2
" we see a peak and a lot of people will be exposed and develop natural immunity , " leading to fewer cases			2
" then it wears off and it ( the number of cases ) will go up again			1
" it is not clear how much bigger this outbreak is when compared with previous ones			0
that 's because increased public awareness and improved diagnostic tests appear to have led to more cases being identified , he said			1
but there is no debate about the seriousness of the disease			0
as many as two in 100 adolescents and five in 100 adults with pertussis are hospitalized or have complications , including pneumonia and death , according to the @entity68			1
the federal health agency recommends that women get the vaccine during each pregnancy , ideally between the 27th and 36th week -- since an estimated 30 % to 40 % of babies who contract whooping cough get it from their mothers -- and that their children undergo a series of five pertussis vaccinations beginning at 2 months of age			1
that first shot is to be followed by injections at 4 months and 6 months , and boosters at 15 to 18 months and again at 4 to 6 years of age so that children 's immunity will be robust during the first months of life when they are most vulnerable			2
both of the @entity2 fatalities were in children younger than 2 months			1
" we want to make sure that they are getting the immunizations on that schedule so that the waning immunity wo n't be as much of an issue , " @entity34 said			0
a separate vaccine is recommended for children ages 11 to 13 and for adults			0
it is considered especially important for people who are around newborns since the bacteria that cause the disease spread easily			0
antibiotics are used to treat the disease			0
@entity2 ' peak is not being replicated nationwide , according to the @entity68			1
the numbers are declining this year , with 14,270 cases reported through august , compared with 32,680 cases through august 2012			1
a @entity68 spokesman said he was aware of no major outbreaks this year			1
" we do not keep a comprehensive list of pertussis outbreaks since states only alert @entity68 to those if they need assistance , " said @entity112 in an e-mail			1
but @entity120 declared an epidemic last year , and @entity122 did so in 2010			1
" it 's our turn , " @entity8 said of @entity2			1
since january , her hospital in @entity14 has seen 63 pertussis patients younger than 7 months of age , 62 % of whom were hospitalized , she said			2
of those , 41 % were treated in the intensive care unit , three of them for more than a month			0
" it 's a very severe disease , " she said			2
the younger the patients , the greater the risk to their lungs			0
" all those airways are small , " she said			0
" when they 're all blocked up , it 's a huge problem , and they have to go on breathing machines and sometimes cardiac bypass just to get oxygen into the brain			2
" the disease can cause coughing so violent that patients ' ribs fracture and they pass out			0
pertussis got the name whooping cough because of the characteristic sound some stricken patients make			2
" children have a whoop after the cough because they 're out of breath , so they go ' whoop , whoop , ' " @entity8 said			0
increasing vaccination rates are a problem , particularly because the series required to confer protection is so complex			0
though more than 90 % of children nationwide get the first three doses , the number who get boosters is far lower , said @entity8 , who served from 2008 to 2010 as chair of the @entity68 's @entity165 , which sets @entity167 policy on vaccines			1
in all , 45 % of pregnant women at @entity170 for women get inoculated during pregnancy , far outstripping the state average of less than 10 % , but that 's not good enough , she said			0
" we need to do better			0
" during the 1930s and 1940s , before widespread vaccination against pertussis , its annual toll comprised nearly 300,000 cases and more than 4,000 deaths , she said			2
in 2006 , there were 15,600 cases and 27 deaths			0
still , pertussis is the most prevalent disease among the pantheon of illnesses against which @entity167 get vaccinated , and there is no indication that it will go away soon , said @entity8 , who cited as obstacles to progress those parents who refuse the vaccine for their children and those adults who do n't know they need it			0
though reporters may be writing about @entity2 this year , they could easily be writing about @entity199 or @entity200 next , she said			1
" @entity146 is going to be , in my prediction , an ongoing problem			0

nearly 2,000 pertussis cases have been reported in @entity2
" we 're clearly having an epidemic , " a pediatrics professor says
ten cases are estimated to occur for every one that 's reported
nationwide , the number of cases is down this year , the @entity68 says
