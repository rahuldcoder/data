@entity0 -- actor @entity7 told lawmakers wednesday how his newborn twins came close to death after an overdose of blood - thinning medication , the fault of a drug company that did not recall easily confused bottles despite previous problems , he said			1
actor @entity7 says that what is happening in the nation 's courts " is no fiction			1
" the incident occurred last year at a @entity19 , @entity20 , hospital , @entity7 told members of the @entity22			1
in the actor also said the " infants nearly died because of a drug company 's failure to put safety first			0
" the panel 's hearing focused on the issue of " pre-emption , " under which @entity32 approval guarantees immunity for drug companies against state lawsuits , because federal law supersedes state law			2
the @entity38 is mulling the issue in a @entity41 case			0
oral arguments are expected in early october			0
" i am in the entertainment industry , but what happened to us , and what is happening in the courts of our country , is no fiction , " @entity7 said in a statement prepared for members of the @entity22 panel			2
" it is all too real			0
that is why i have decided to speak out and do something			0
" @entity56 say " @entity58 's negligence was an accident waiting to happen " Â» the actor 's actual statement was abridged , as he and other witnesses were given a five - minute time limit on remarks			1
committee chairman @entity65 , @entity20 , said , " this is exactly the wrong time for the @entity32 to say , ' trust us			0
' as a result of chronic underfunding and weak leadership , @entity32 's ability to protect the public is plummeting			0
" he said the agency has believed that state liability helped the agency regulate drugs and devices but has changed its stance under the @entity81 administration			0
in response to @entity7 's testimony , the company that made the drugs involved -- @entity58 -- issued a statement saying human error was to blame , noting that the finding was supported by the @entity88			1
in november , @entity7 's 12 - day - old twins , @entity90 and @entity91 , were undergoing intravenous antibiotic treatment for a staph infection at @entity19 ' @entity94			1
according to standard procedure , nurses were supposed to clean the infants ' iv lines with @entity99 , a drug containing a very small dose of the blood thinner heparin , to allow the lines to flow freely			1
however , instead of the 10 units of heparin they were supposed to receive , the twins received 10,000 units , 1,000 times the prescribed amount			1
the babies survived , apparently with no permanent injury , @entity7 told members of @entity111 , although no one knows whether they will show any long - term effects			2
the actor grew emotional as he recalled a 41 - hour ordeal in which his infants ' blood was the consistency of water and their bodies bore bruises from internal bleeding			2
" it made me feel that they had survived for a reason ... that maybe they were going to change the world in a little way , " he said			0
in researching the incident , @entity7 told lawmakers he found that the bottles of 10 - unit @entity99 and 10,000 - unit heparin were " virtually indistinguishable			1
" both drugs are manufactured by @entity58			2
he also learned that the labels ' similarity led to an overdose of infants at an @entity139 , @entity140 , hospital in 2006			0
three babies died and three were injured			0
four months after that incident , he said , @entity58 sent a warning to hospitals regarding the potential for mistakes			1
seven months after that , @entity58 received permission to change the labels			2
however , @entity7 said , @entity58 failed to recall the previous bottles that were in hospitals			1
" they recall automobiles ; they recall toasters ; they even recall dog food , " @entity7 said			2
" although mistakes did occur at @entity94 , the overdosing of our twins was a chain of events of human error -- and the first link in that chain was @entity58			1
" @entity58 , meanwhile , said in its statement that its heparin vials " have been used safely more than 100,000 times a day , a fact that contradicts the implication that two of the company 's vials are indistinguishable			1
" the two hospitals where tragic errors occurred with @entity58 's heparin products reported that these were isolated events resulting from a system failure in the hospital along with human and procedural errors , such as not reading the label			2
" @entity7 and his wife , @entity181 , have filed suit against @entity58 in state court			1
the drug company has filed a motion to dismiss the case , relying on the pre-emption argument , @entity7 said			0
@entity58 spokeswoman @entity188 said in the statement that the company did not recall the vials because the medication errors were not related to the safety or efficacy of the product , and " @entity58 's vials , even before the label enhancement , were better differentiated than other heparin products on the market			0
" the company said it contacted the @entity202 ' attorney in march to ask whether the couple would partner with them and medication safety experts on a program aimed at reducing medication errors but had not received a response			0
" @entity58 is hopeful that it can resolve this litigation and partner together with the @entity202 for the beneffit of clinicians and patients rather than continue to litigate this matter in the courts , " the statement said .			0
