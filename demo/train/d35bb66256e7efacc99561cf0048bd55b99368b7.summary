-- kudos to the @entity2 for a new study documenting that black students , especially boys , receive much harsher discipline than other students in public schools			1
many black people would tell you they knew this already , but it generally takes data for institutional change to occur			1
the coverage of the study in the @entity16 last week got me thinking about what needs to be done			1
while we must attack the problem on multiple fronts , one part of the solution will not be found in scholarly journals or five - point plans			1
it is sleeping deep in our histories and needs to be awakened and put to work			0
it is the communal love of our children			1
not just one or two of us doing it , and not just when it is convenient or our children are behaving and excelling			1
children in trouble need caring and confidence - building now -- right now			1
the @entity16 article took me back to thoughts i had in watching all the media coverage of the hit movie " the help , " about black domestic servants and white women during the days of segregation			1
i remembered how profoundly the messages we get as children shape our world as adults			1
one of the most memorable lines from " @entity42 " rolls easily off my tongue			0
a black maid , @entity53 , repeatedly tells @entity54 , a young white girl she cares for : " you is kind			1
" @entity53 's message reaches far beyond the relationship of a black woman turned mother figure to a white child			1
it is a message that touches the very essence of human dignity and self - esteem in a world that can be unrelentingly cold and unkind			1
how much better a world this would be if every child were encouraged to be kind			2
kind in the face of unkind acts and deeds			0
kind when differences of opinion are strong and the stench of bigotry and discrimination are pervasive			0
@entity53 's lesson to @entity54 was not to become hardened by a world that was hard on her			2
she wanted @entity54 to remember , once she was old enough to discover that her form was not thought beautiful by her own kind , that she was smart and she was important			0
how much better a world this would be if every child was told she or he is smart			2
would more of our children excel in math and science ? would fewer drop out of school ? oh what we could accomplish if every parent , every adult and every teacher said over and over and over , to every child , every day , all through the day : " you are smart ! " our children are starving for positive feedback and expressions of confidence in their abilities to achieve			2
we must anchor our children 's confidence in our unwavering belief in their ability to do great things			2
@entity0 : love key to brain development in children how much better a world this would be if every child felt important			1
important enough for parents to make them a priority			2
important enough to know they have special gifts and talents			0
important enough to have teachers and school administrators who really care			0
sometimes all the edge we need to achieve great things is to know we are unique and special			0
i was born at time when more than a few sadly misguided black folk openly supported a black caste system based on skin color and hair texture and length -- the closer to white , the better			1
although few openly promote such a system today , vestiges of that thinking remain			0
the ranges of skin color and hair type among black folk are from deep , rich blue - black to ca n't - tell - you - from - a - white - person ; and hair can be short and coarse / nappy to coarse and long to straight and long and all in between			1
my mother and father were opposite ends of the color and hair spectrum			0
she was fair - skinned with a head full of hair ; he was much darker with somewhat coarse hair			0
my sister , the first - born , entered the world with a light complexion like our mother			2
her hair was long , dusty - red and very coarse			0
my brother , the third child , was of medium complexion with keen features like our mother			0
i was the middle child , features like my mother and the complexion and hair texture of my father			0
there i was , a dark - skinned girl child with short , nappy hair : a recipe for a hard life			2
but to the contrary , i live a rich and full life , have considerable professional accomplishments and most importantly , i know why			0
my family , understanding how skin color , hair length and texture played out in our community and beyond , made it their business to build incredible self - esteem and confidence within me			1
they nurtured and prepared me for a world that would not always respond to me with open and caring arms			2
my skin color was my skin color , and my hair texture and length were uniquely mine -- all part of a beautiful package			1
neither skin color nor hair could stop me from achieving anything			0
there are many circumstances , things and people making our children feel they are less than and that they do not measure up			0
there are many things we must not tolerate from our schools			0
while we can not stop the world from hurling stones of self - doubt at our children , we can fortify our children and strengthen their resolve to overcome			1
in our words and in our touch , we can turn the tide of low self - esteem , insecurity about competence and abilities and hatred and intolerance toward others that bubble up in too many of our young people			0
in whatever language used , however grammatically correct or incorrect , every child deserves to have his or her face gently held and to be told : " you is kind			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			1

@entity227 : a study showed black children more harshly disciplined in schools
she says a part of solution is communal love of children , fostering dignity in a cold world
she says growing up in black community , her dark skin could have lowered her standing
she says her parents ' support made difference ; all parents must show kids their love
