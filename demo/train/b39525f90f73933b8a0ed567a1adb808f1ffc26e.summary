-- look out for cancellation penalties			2
and watch for facilities fees			0
@entity4 lost $ 73 million in the fourth quarter of 2008			1
no , not on your airline ticket			0
not on your hotel folio			0
you may find these new extras on your next car rental bill			1
beleaguered auto rental firms are quietly adding new surcharges designed to lift revenues in a recessionary economy			1
to get an idea of how absurd it 's becoming meet @entity17			2
he found a mysterious $ 5 fee on his @entity4 bill recently , which a representative described as a cancellation fee			1
car rental companies typically do n't charge their customers for cancellations , so @entity17 , who frequently rents from @entity4 , said he did n't want another car he 'd reserved for later			1
" that 'll be $ 25 , " the agent told him			2
" so i jokingly said i would not cancel but just be a no - show , " he remembers			0
" she said that would result in a $ 50 fee			1
" or talk to @entity34 , a photographer from @entity35 , @entity36 , who spotted a $ 1 " energy surcharge " on his @entity4 car rental bill recently			1
" my previous rentals did n't have one , " he says			0
i asked @entity4 about the two new surcharges			1
@entity43 spokeswoman @entity42 told me the cancellation fee , which was added in december , applied only to prepaid reservations and is meant to " reimburse @entity4 for the paperwork and billing involved with a prepaid reservation			1
" the fee also covers part of the company 's cost of holding vehicles for prepaid reservations			2
the energy surcharge , which was added in october , bills all rentals in most states an additional $ 1 a day " to offset the increasing costs of utilities , bus fuel , oil and grease , " she said			1
it 's easy to see why car rental companies are taking these steps			1
the industry is hemorrhaging money faster than oil leaking from a cracked gasket			0
@entity4 lost $ 73 million in the fourth quarter , and competitor @entity70 lost $ 121 million in the same period			1
they fared much better than @entity72 , which filed for bankruptcy protection in december and whose assets were sold to @entity4 for a reported $ 33 million			1
every penny counts for the car rental companies			1
then again , in this dreadful economy , who is n't counting every cent ? shocking anecdotes aside , there 's a pattern here , and you do n't have to be an investigative reporter or a conspiracy theory - obsessed columnist to see it			2
just read the annual reports issued by one of the publicly traded car rental companies			1
( look for the @entity92 and then scroll down to " legal proceedings " for an enlightening read			0
) they 're littered with lawsuits over fees , surcharges and add - ons that motorists say broadsided them when they rented a car			1
a representative of the @entity104 , a trade group for the car rental business , says these fees are essential to the industry 's survival			1
but that does n't give companies a license to surprise their customers			0
" the car rental company has an obligation to clearly and concisely explain all fees and charges at the time of rental , " says @entity113 , the association 's president and chief operating officer for @entity116			1
how to stay ahead of these extras ? knowing is half the battle			0
here are five of the newer charges that could sideswipe you on your next trip			2
a fee for something you 've already paid for this is one of the more creative new ways of separating you from your money : charging you twice for the same thing			2
" three times now , with three different companies , they have tried to charge me for gas when i 've returned the car with a full tank and claimed it was an honest mistake , " says @entity137 , a software engineer in @entity138 , @entity139			2
" it leads me to suspect they are just tacking the fee on and most people are n't noticing or complaining about it			2
" @entity153 - based author @entity152 brought his own @entity155 toll transponder when he rented a car in @entity157 recently , but @entity158 billed him for the toll roads anyway			2
" we 're still trying to resolve it , " he told me			0
now more than ever , it 's important to be on the lookout for duplicate charges on your rental bill			1
a fee for something that should come with the car such as tires			1
@entity171 recently charged one of @entity174 's readers a $ 2 " tire fee			1
" he edits a web site called @entity177 , and like me , he hears a lot of horror stories from travelers			0
what 's a tire fee ? @entity171 told @entity174 it was required by the state of @entity185			1
" i guess the consumer advice is to order a car without tires next time , " he joked			2
but other fees ca n't be blamed on the state , including surcharges that cover the cost of oil and grease			2
it might be interesting to show up at a car rental counter with four tires and a can of @entity200 , and ask to have those fees waived			1
you think they would do it ? yeah , neither do i. surcharge on surcharges @entity208 found a " privilege fee " on his last car rental in @entity185 , which applied to rentals picked up within 48 hours of flight arrival			1
" never seen anything like it , " says the @entity215 , @entity214 - based freelance publicist			0
( the fee covers the costs of operating an off - airport location			2
) other renters have reported seeing a similar surcharge combined with what 's often called a concession recovery fee , which amounts to a surcharge on top of a surcharge			2
at best , car rental companies are coming up with new and confusing names for their fees			1
at worst , they 're charging us a fee on top of another fee			0
next thing you know , there 'll be a surcharge on a surcharge on top of a surcharge			0
do n't laugh -- i 'm sure they 've already thought of it			0
the stadium tax fees for new stadiums and concert halls are technically not new , and technically they 're not even controlled by car rental companies			1
except that municipalities keep coming up with new ones and car rental companies do n't lobby hard enough to have the fees removed			1
so rental firms are not completely blameless			1
@entity256 , the president of a food store in @entity258 , @entity259 , found a $ 4 " downtown arena " fee on his bill when he visited @entity263 recently			2
" apparently the city is trying to pay for part of the @entity267 through car rental fees , " he told me			1
there are dozens -- perhaps hundreds -- of these so - called stadium taxes across the country			0
and new ones keep popping up			0
one of the latest is a car rental tax in @entity275 , @entity276 , to build a stadium for the @entity278			1
and just last week , legislators proposed a $ 2 tax to fund commuter rail service in @entity185			0
extra driver fees these are n't brand new , but the way in which they 're being enforced has changed recently			0
when @entity287 and her sister rented a car from @entity290 in @entity291 , they were asked to pay $ 9 a day more if @entity293 's sister wanted to drive			2
" and that did n't include their insurance waiver , " she remembers			0
why charge for an extra driver ? the simple answer : because they can			0
in the past , car rental agents looked the other way when two drivers showed up to rent the same car			1
but now , with money tight , they 're applying more pressure to authorize a second driver			0
if you do n't fork over the money and happen to get into an accident , they warn , you wo n't be covered by their insurance			0
of course , that assumes you buy their overpriced collision - damage waiver in the first place			0
odds are , your credit card or car insurance offers comparable coverage			0
most of these fees can be avoided by pre-paying for your car through one of the " opaque " travel sites such as @entity327 or @entity328 , or by buying through an online travel agency that guarantees its rates			0
but car rental companies are trying to find a way to stick it to customers with prepaid vouchers , too			1
i 'll have more on that in a future column			0
where will it end ? something tells me we 're not there yet			0
( @entity343 is the ombudsman for @entity346 magazine			0
this column originally appeared on @entity348			0
