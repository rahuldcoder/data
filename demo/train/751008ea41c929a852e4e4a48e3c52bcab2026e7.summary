-- @entity1 and @entity2 go hand to hand in the @entity4			1
on its return to the competition after a five - year absence , the @entity6 club narrowly skirted past @entity12 minnows @entity10 2 - 1 thanks to an injury - time penalty from captain @entity15			1
after all , this is a club that was 3 - 0 down to @entity19 giants @entity18 in the 2005 final and seemingly dead and buried before roaring back to win its fifth @entity21 crown on penalties			1
a night that started with all the fervor and emotion expected of @entity27 on a @entity4 night quickly turned into a frustrating one , until @entity29 's 82nd minute strike			1
the controversial @entity19 striker , signed from @entity18 , has gone three matches without scoring since joining the club and relief was evident once he 'd found the net			0
@entity27 purred but perhaps neglected to remember that @entity10 are no strangers to drama themselves			1
the @entity12 made the group stages for the first time thanks to defender @entity41 's heroics in the playoff , deputizing for its dismissed goalkeeper and saving two penalties in a shootout against @entity46			0
and just as the game ticked towards the final whistle , @entity47 galloped through @entity2 's defense to score and silence @entity51			2
the @entity52 needed a hero , and as is so often the case , found one in @entity15 , who dispatched a last - gasp penalty after @entity57 had been fouled			1
@entity27 could relax once more			2
" it 's always nice to win a game , especially when you think you 're going to drop two points , " @entity15 told @entity58			2
" the game as a whole , we did n't do better than ok and have a lot to learn			0
" you 've got to give ( @entity29 ) credit , everyone has been waiting for his first goal			0
it did n't go his way for a long time but when you 've got his ability you only need one chance			0
" the key tonight was three points before the performance but at @entity2 we always analyze how we 've done and to judge that performance -- must do better			2
" there had been little to shout about for @entity2 prior to @entity29 's intervention , @entity79 coming closest in the opening half			0
the home side , who has lost two of its four @entity6 matches this season , were lucky to escape when @entity85 hit the post with 20 minutes remaining			0
then @entity29 's class showed as he pounced on a loose ball inside the area to prod into the far corner in front of @entity92			0
@entity2 switched off in the closing stages and when @entity47 rounded goalkeeper @entity95 to slide into an empty net , it looked as if the @entity12 ' debut in the competition would yield a famous draw			0
but a mistake from @entity101 allowed @entity57 to nip in and steal the ball , only for the @entity10 goalkeeper to bring him down			0
@entity15 , whose performance inspired that 2005 comeback in @entity105 , showed composure to slot home from the spot and seal three hard - earned points			2
" it was a great night for everyone at club , it 's been five years so to get a result was excellent , " @entity2 manager @entity110 told @entity58			0
" i do n't think we 're at the level as we were at last year , but there have been a lot of new players come in and it will take a bit of time			0
" elsewhere , @entity123 started its campaign to become the first side to successfully defend a @entity4 title with a comprehensive 5 - 1 dismantling of @entity129 side @entity128			1
goals from @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 were added to by a @entity136 own goal as the @entity138 giants bounced back from a derby defeat to @entity140 on saturday			1
@entity140 , beaten in last season 's final by @entity123 , were stunned 3 - 2 by @entity142 in @entity143 , @entity144 grabbing what proved to be the winning goal			1
@entity151 , finalists in 2013 when they were beaten by fellow @entity150 @entity149 , got off to a winning start by defeating @entity154 side @entity153 2 - 0			1
goals in each half from @entity157 and @entity158 sealed victory in a match that saw @entity153 's new striker @entity161 miss several chances			2
@entity19 champions @entity163 beat @entity165 side @entity164 2 - 0 thanks to a brace from @entity169 striker @entity168 , while @entity171 side @entity170 drew 1 - 1 with @entity172 , from @entity173			1
there were also wins for @entity177 side @entity175 , who beat @entity150 side @entity180 1 - 0 , and @entity182 outfit @entity181 , who defeated @entity184 2 - 0 in @entity185 .			1

@entity15 seals victory for @entity2 on @entity4 return
