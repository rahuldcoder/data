-- if @entity2 were a close friend and you had a secret to tell , she 'd be an obvious choice to go to for some relief			1
not necessarily because she would n't broadcast it , but because she 'd probably hold your hand , ease the tension , listen sympathetically and not make you feel too bad about yourself if the secret 's more like a skeleton			0
you both might even shed a few tears			0
in essence , this is the persona that @entity2 has crafted over the years as she 's moved from newcomer host on " am @entity16 , " to the queen of daytime tv with " the @entity19 , " to the current chief executive officer of @entity21 , the @entity21			1
she 's relatable , but still inspiring ; candid without being crass ; and about as vulnerable as a billionaire media titan can be			0
" one of @entity2 's major products is redemption , " @entity23 , a professor of religious and @entity25 studies at @entity26 , told @entity27			1
" she sold the experience of confession -- of hearing somebody 's darkest story , and offering to them the possibility of relief from its articulation			0
" as a result , @entity2 has inspired her fair share of televised confessions , from everyday guests to high - profile names			1
if you need to come clean and find a new path , @entity2 's the one to show you how to do it			1
disgraced cyclist @entity47 is the latest celebrity to sit down with @entity2 for a " no - holds - barred " two - part chat set to begin airing on her network thursday night			1
in the pre-taped " @entity51 " interview , @entity47 is expected to admit to using performance - enhancing substances during his heralded career -- a sharp about - face after he steadfastly denied doping allegations			1
stripped of his seven @entity58 titles and banned from the sport , @entity47 is not only facing a mountainous public relations hurdle , but also possible legal ramifications			2
while @entity2 has said she 's never had an interview this big in terms of exposure , she does have a reputation as a go - to for the celebrity confessional interview			1
in the past , we 've seen notable guests drop by " @entity2 " when they needed to get something off their chests , address missteps , overhaul their images , or all of the above			2
after a video appeared to catch @entity76 , the @entity76 , getting money for access to her ex-husband , @entity76 went to @entity2			2
@entity81 was sure to hit the " @entity2 " show when she made the decision to come out in 1997			2
@entity81 even invited @entity2 for a cameo appearance on her prime - time comedy , " @entity81			2
" there was also former track and field star @entity88 ' post-prison talk with @entity2 in 2008 -- memorable for the athlete 's tears -- and @entity92 's frank and at turns unsettling discussion of drug use with @entity2 in 2009			2
" @entity2 is known for giving the interviewee fair time and creating a relaxed environment , " @entity95 , president of public relations firm @entity96 , said via e-mail of @entity2 's draw			2
" she gives the subject a lot of rope and room to talk			0
" these sit - downs do n't always yield the answers the audience is looking for , but @entity2 has a knack for creating a rapport with her guests that makes it , at the very least , a riveting watch			2
( @entity114 : @entity115 getting so comfortable with @entity2 that he thought it was ok to jump on her couch while professing his love for @entity119			1
) for example , @entity120 opened up to @entity2 last week about suffering from depression and the 2009 scandal he caused when he admitted to sleeping with staffers on his late night show			2
" i have no one to blame but myself , " @entity120 told @entity2 , expressing the kind of self - reflection viewers at home want to see			0
" in @entity120 's case -- and certainly with @entity47 -- she is probing very uncomfortable , damaging and embarrassing behavior , " @entity95 continued			0
" individuals facing these situations are uncomfortable with a rapid - fire line of questioning -- they shut down , act stiff or stick to a script			0
@entity2 is able to create an atmosphere that is conducive to these types of uncomfortable interviews			1
" part of that could be because of her brand 's emphasis on renewal and transformation , with some of her content instructing participants on how to repair past damage to move forward and clear room for one 's " best life			1
" " this idea of the confessional as a way of apologizing , as a way of transforming yourself ... and mak ( ing ) things better is something that @entity2 really banks on , " said @entity152 , the @entity153 professor of journalism , diversity and equality at the @entity156			1
" all of the celebrity advice people that she 's spawned like @entity168 and dr. @entity169 , it 's all about saying you take personal responsibility for yourself , and focusing on this idea that everyone has to figure out some magic formula to make themselves a better person			0
" indeed , the best outcome for anyone walking through @entity2 's confession session would be the opportunity to hit the restart button -- a goal that may have factored into @entity47 's choice to come forward now and talk to @entity2			1
in an interview with " @entity188 " on tuesday , not even @entity2 could say definitively why @entity47 decided at this point to come forward , but she did say it was a difficult interview and that @entity47 " brought it			1
" that euphemism may not have satisfied the skeptical , however , who have pointed out that talking with @entity47 about his transgressions would n't be the same as exploring a slip - up by a pop star			0
" the major criticism with her interviews is that she 's a soft - baller , " said @entity196 staff editor @entity195 " when it came out that @entity47 was going to do this interview , it was like , ' of course , ' because she 's not going to be hard - hitting with him			0
you watch ' @entity51 , ' and @entity205 's crying on it			0
there 's that expectation that she 's going to go a little easy on him			0
" winfrey herself has said that she prepared for this interview as if it were a college exam , and walked into it with 112 questions to ask -- although she did n't get to all of them			0
but perhaps @entity2 's @entity188 interview was the most interesting confession of all in this scenario , suggested the @entity156 's @entity218			1
after all , it ca n't be ignored what a great opportunity this is for the media mogul to expose -- and , really , just help viewers find -- her new cable network			0
" the fact that she did interviews about getting the @entity47 interview is interesting			0
... when she had her own daytime show , she would n't need to do any pre-press or pre-publicity , because everybody would know that @entity47 was going to be on ' @entity2 , ' " @entity152 said			1
" her network does not get the viewership that her show got , so for her to get the @entity47 interview is as much about proving she has still has it as anything about whether @entity47 is going to be forgiven by the public , or get a ' get out of jail free ' card from the people who are investigating him			0

@entity2 has a reputation for being a master of confessional tv
