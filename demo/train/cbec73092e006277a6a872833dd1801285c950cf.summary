-- @entity1 finally lost patience with manager @entity3 tuesday after a disastrous first season in charge of the @entity7 champions			1
" @entity1 announces that @entity3 has left the club , " said the @entity7 team in a statement on the club 's official @entity11 feed			1
" the club would like to place on record its thanks for the hard work , honesty and integrity he brought to the role			0
" @entity3 succeeded @entity21 last may but has overseen a lackluster campaign , with the club lying seventh in the table having amassed 57 points from 34 games			1
@entity1 slipped to an 11th league defeat this season against the @entity31 's former club @entity30 at @entity32 on sunday -- a result that finally ended any mathematical chance of participating in next season 's @entity35			1
the three - time winner of the @entity40 club football 's biggest prize is now 13 points behind fourth - placed @entity42 with four games remaining			0
the last time @entity1 failed to qualify was in 1995 and their chances of even playing in the @entity46 next season are slim			2
" the football and the results have been poor , " former @entity1 defender @entity47 told @entity48			0
" the performances have got worse and worse			0
" soon after @entity3 ' departure was confirmed , @entity1 appointed current player - coach @entity53 as caretaker manager			1
" @entity53 , the club 's most decorated player , will assume responsibility for the first team until a permanent appointment can be made , " said @entity1 in a statement			2
" the club will make no further comment on this process until it is concluded			0
" @entity3 , who turns 51 on friday , signed a six - year - deal with @entity65 football 's most successful club last may , when the outgoing @entity21 personally endorsed his appointment			1
" @entity3 is a man of great integrity with a strong work ethic ... there is no question he has all the qualities we expect of a manager at this club , " @entity21 said of his compatriot			1
@entity21 also implored @entity1 fans to stand by @entity3 when he addressed them following his last game in charge at @entity79 last season , which ended with his 13th league title in a trophy - laden 27 - year reign			1
but @entity1 's owners , the @entity86 family , have clearly had second thoughts following a persistently stuttering campaign -- which has led to the club falling down football 's rich list			2
in january it was reported that @entity1 's share price had fallen 16 % since @entity3 took over , while @entity95 's annual football money table placed the @entity79 team outside of the world 's top three richest clubs for the first time in 17 years			2
@entity3 opened his account with a 2 - 0 win against @entity102 in the @entity104 match at @entity105 in august and followed it with a convincing 4 - 1 win at @entity107 in the opening game of the league season			0
but pressure soon started piling up in september with league defeats against arch rivals @entity112 , @entity113 and , embarrassingly , @entity114 at @entity79 -- the @entity117 ' club first win at the " @entity79 " for 34 years			0
@entity1 also endured embarrassing exits from both domestic knockout competitions , losing at home to @entity107 in the third round of the @entity122 and going down on penalties against another struggling @entity7 team -- @entity125 -- in the @entity127 semifinals			0
hopes of @entity35 glory were ended by @entity130 in the quarterfinals earlier this month , with the reigning @entity40 champion winning 4 - 2 on aggregate			0
@entity135 @entity134 has been installed as the favorite to succeed @entity3 on a permanent basis by @entity139 bookmaker current player - coach @entity53 and his former @entity1 team - mate @entity140 are reportedly set to be placed in caretaker charge for saturday 's home game with @entity143 .			2

@entity3 is dismissed after less than a year in charge of @entity65 league *titleholder*
the @entity31 was personally endorsed by outgoing manager @entity21
@entity3 ' @entity1 slipped to 11th league defeat against his former club @entity30 on sunday
@entity1 will not feature in @entity35 for first time since 1995
