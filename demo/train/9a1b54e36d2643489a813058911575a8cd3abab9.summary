-- @entity1 drove the race of his young life to secure an unlikely victory for @entity5 sunday in an incident - packed @entity7 @entity6 which saw @entity9 ignore @entity11 team orders to let title leader @entity12 through			1
@entity13 's @entity1 overtook two - time world champion @entity14 of @entity15 for the lead on lap 68 of 70 at the @entity17 for his second victory of the season			1
@entity9 claimed the final podium spot after starting from the pit lane and spinning off the track on the first lap with @entity12 in fourth place			1
but the intense rivalry between the pair reached a head when @entity9 refused to allow @entity12 through at a crucial stage of the race			1
the @entity30 , who made one more pit stop than his teammate , showed his impatience on race radio			0
" why is he not letting me through , " he complained			0
@entity9 countered by saying @entity12 had not been close enough			1
" i 'll let him through if he gets closer , " he said			0
" i 'm not slowing down for @entity12 ... " the 2008 world champion 's stubborness looked set to be rewarded by a remarkable victory as he closed on @entity14 , whose own tires were losing their grip			2
but @entity1 , who won earlier this season in @entity44 , was the fastest off all the front runners and first went past @entity9 before surging clear of @entity14			1
@entity12 , who still leads the championship from @entity47 by 11 points , was making up about three seconds per lap on the top three after his stop for new tires , but his charge came too late			2
@entity9 , whose challenge was so nearly over on the opening lap , was helped by the safety car being deployed twice as drivers crashed out on a wet but drying track			0
the first safety car disadvantaged @entity12 , who looked impregnable in first place after starting from pole			2
@entity1 was among those who were able to switch to slick tires at that point , while @entity12 had to wait an extra lap and lost position			2
" it feels as good as the first win , it really does , " said @entity1 at the trophy presentation			0
" the safety car at first played to our advantage but the second one did n't really help us , but we got there in the end and i had to do the overtaking at the end which was fun			0
" @entity76 for @entity77 and @entity78 in the second @entity15 showed their experience by finishing fifth and sixth with four - time world champion @entity80 took seventh , again overshadowed by his young @entity5 teammate @entity1			1
@entity80 was the last driver to start from the pit lane and take a podium spot in the @entity84 of 2012 and @entity9 was delighted to emulate him after a fire in his engine wrecked his qualifying effort on saturday			1
" it 's been a crazy weekend , " he said			0
" the car has been fantastic but there were a lot of points lost this weekend			0
the brakes were very , very cold ( at the start ) and i was gone but i got going again and managed to push on from there			0
" but the ramifications of his refusal to follow team orders is set to rumble on with @entity11 team chief @entity100 telling gathered reporters there would be an internal inquiry , but " no knee - jerk reaction			2

@entity1 wins @entity7 @entity6 for @entity5
@entity14 takes fine second in his @entity15
@entity9 in third after starting from pit lane
@entity9 ignored team orders to move over for @entity12
