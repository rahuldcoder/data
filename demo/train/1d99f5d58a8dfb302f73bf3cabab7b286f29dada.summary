the @entity2 's recent statement that @entity3 may have conducted air strikes against @entity6 targets in @entity8 's @entity7 is tantamount to a @entity10 tacit approval of @entity3 's growing military footprint in @entity8			1
no military operation of such scale evades detection from @entity10 radars			0
even if not pre-approved or coordinated , @entity3 's air and ground operations against the murderous thugs of self - proclaimed caliph @entity19 make the @entity21 effectively a @entity10 partner in the fight against @entity10 's greatest enemy : @entity26 fundamentalism			1
the @entity10 strategy towards the @entity28 since the @entity29 has been defined by proactive disengagement and hesitance			1
haunted by the legacy of @entity8 and @entity34 , the @entity10 public has no stomach to get bogged down in lengthy ground - intense military operations -- particularly not to fight a fight that at least in @entity39 is perceived to be primarily a matter of regional concern			2
and it seems as if apart from a general war fatigue and casualty aversion back home , @entity10 president @entity42 does not want to be remembered as the president who embarked on a third @entity28 adventure			1
as a hostage of public opinion , @entity42 in his second term increasingly appears to be the lame - duck choosing a path of minimal resistance overseas , making decisions not based on long - term strategic considerations but based on a short - term approach of damage control			1
in @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity8 the @entity10 has taken a backseat calling on local partners and proxies to take over			2
any ex-ante foreclosure of boots on the ground means that the @entity10 will not bring its military might to bear to deal with those threatening to tear the @entity28 apart			1
in @entity60 the @entity10 ignored the problem of @entity70 , in @entity8 it turned a blind eye to @entity73 's policies of exclusion while allowing @entity59 to degenerate into a state of anarchy			2
without a sustainable proactive strategy towards the @entity28 , the @entity10 policy towards the region was more often than not shaped in reaction to quickly escalating events on the ground			1
as a result , the @entity10 today looks at a region where the states of @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity8 have effectively ceased to exist			0
the socio - political vacuum has been filled by transnational non-state actors of whom many subscribe to the black banners of jihadism -- something that leaves the @entity10 public deeply unsettled			2
the broadcasted images of @entity10 citizens being brutally beheaded in front of a global audience shook @entity10 to its core			0
after years of relative disengagement and idleness , @entity42 is now forced to do something in @entity60 and @entity8 at last			0
thereby , the overriding principle seems to be to keep the military footprint as small as possible			0
the major burden of intervention has to be borne by force multipliers who operationally as well as strategically substitute @entity10 willingness and capability -- all this in a war that is no longer about protecting the revolutionary achievements of the @entity29 but about primarily containing the threat of @entity26 fundamentalism			0
in this war , @entity59 renegade general general @entity111 , @entity70 and @entity3 are the lesser of two evils			0
the unlikely coalition formed the multilateral response of the @entity10 administration to the dilemma of reconciling public security concerns with public war fatigue			0
yet , @entity3 appears the more reliable partner : a regional superpower with the necessary capability , strategic will and input on the ground			0
good cooperation with @entity128 , even if indirect , allows the @entity10 to put pressure on its @entity131 partners in the @entity132 to step up their game against @entity26 fundamentalism in the region			1
at the same time the @entity10 wants the @entity136 to constructively commit to providing the options on the ground , the @entity10 is no longer able or willing to provide			0
not to forget , the rapprochement with @entity3 also allows @entity42 to put a final end to @entity141 's saber rattling vis - Ã  - vis @entity128			1
the @entity10 , although committed to @entity143 's security , will not be available for a military solution to the @entity3 nuclear question			0
the @entity10 - @entity3 rapprochement on the region 's most sensitive battlefield of all things , further undermines @entity10 's position in the @entity28			1
apart from losing the hearts and minds of the region , @entity10 's credibility as a superpower is in doubt as long as capability is constrained by the political unwillingness to use it			1
without the @entity10 willpower to take a more long - term strategic approach to tackling the socio - political root causes of regional upheaval , regional players , including @entity70 , will step in to develop their own strategy independently			2
the result will be a gradual intensification of regional confrontation along sectarian and ideological fault lines -- a confrontation to which the @entity10 will be a mere onlooker .			0

the @entity10 strategy towards the @entity28 has been disengaging , writes @entity174
president @entity42 increasingly appears to be the lame - duck , he writes
@entity174 : good cooperation with @entity128 allows the @entity10 to put pressure on its @entity131 partners
@entity10 's credibility as a superpower is in doubt , he says
