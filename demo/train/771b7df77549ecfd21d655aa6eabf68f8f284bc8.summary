@entity13 after weeks of tough talk about @entity13 , the candidates made little mention of the growing superpower			1
netizens in @entity13 did not seem to take sides but instead used the debate to banter about the relationship with the @entity7			1
" whoever the winner , they are still all scoundrels and will not benefit @entity13 in any way , " a tweet by @ @entity26 read on @entity13 's @entity28 social network			1

" " the decisions to be made in @entity59 here will not only be based on the trade volumes but on domestic political concerns , " he said			0

" @entity125 was also disappointed there was no mention of a long - term strategy towards @entity100 and @entity12			1
" i can understand at the moment the @entity7 public wants the government to exit from @entity100 , but surely there should be a strategy for that , because we have suffered once in the 1990s with that void , when @entity100 was left ( by the @entity136 )			2
