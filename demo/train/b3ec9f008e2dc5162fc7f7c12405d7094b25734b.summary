-- on a recent flight from @entity3 , i was delayed on the tarmac for an hour and a half			2
the woman seated behind me played two @entity8 songs on a loop on her @entity10			1
at one point the woman took a call			0
" i 'm on the plane , " i heard her tell the caller			0
" it 's @entity8 on my @entity10 ! " then , " i do n't have headphones			1
but everyone likes @entity8 ! " anyone who has ever been on a plane , and is over the age of 10 , has probably experienced some form of air rage			1
creating it , witnessing it or just making a supreme mental effort not to succumb to it by thumping your seatmate for an outrageous offense such as playing loud music , noisily speaking on the phone or eating food so stinky it might actually be considered a weapon			0
the good news : you 're not alone			0
the bad news : air rage is becoming routine			1
the @entity43 ( @entity43 ) saw a 29 % rise in incidents on board flights between 2009 and 2010			0
the @entity47 , however , has seen a decline over the last three years in security - related disturbances the agency has been called to deal with on planes			0
air rage : passengers ' quicker to snap ' however you slice it , you do n't have to work too hard to notice multiple recent examples of passengers losing their cool in lavish fashion			1
this year alone we 've seen some impressive displays of in - flight fury			1
january started with an unruly passenger aboard a @entity64 to @entity66 flight who finished his journey rather inelegantly duct - taped to a seat after an apparent display of screaming , hitting and spitting at fellow passengers			1
later that month , a @entity73 flight from @entity66 to @entity74 made an unscheduled stop in @entity76 to remove a woman who allegedly became verbally abusive after another passenger was moved to a neighboring " even more legroom " seat near her			0
the source of the woman 's rage was apparently that the man had not paid for the extra legroom ( $ 65 ) , but had been moved there due to a broken television in his seat			2
in february , a male passenger on a flight to @entity3 is accused of hitting another passenger 's crying baby , uttering a racial slur as he did so			2
man accused of slapping toddler will plead not guilty according to an @entity99 affidavit , a passenger on a february hawaiian airlines flight from @entity66 assaulted a flight attendant , spat food at people and bit an air marshal			2
and another february incident proved that you do n't even have to be up in the air to experience air travel - related anger			2
@entity109 , identified by @entity110 as an executive and @entity113 official , became incensed at @entity114 in @entity114 , @entity115			0
learning he 'd missed not one but two flights , @entity109 vented his rage by flinging equipment and smashing windows in an impressive tirade that has since gone viral			0
airline squeeze : it 's not you , it 's the seat frustrations on the ground and in the air may seem to invite air rage			1
before fliers even reach their allocated metal bird , they 've often struggled through security and customs lines and may face delays at the gate or on board			0
and the @entity138 ' recent mandatory government spending cuts could make those slowdowns at airports worse			0
airlines , angling to make a profit , are chipping away at legroom or charging extra for a little more room , introducing new fees or bundling and unbundling the existing charges and re-jiggering mileage programs to favor the elite big - spenders			0
travelers take aim at kids on a plane air travelers are agitated , but it does n't quite explain why some boil over on planes			0
is the altitude getting to them ? @entity160 's dr. @entity159 points out that fliers can experience mild brain swelling even at low altitudes that can make it harder to keep your cool			0
@entity167 are enraged passengers just under the influence ? " if you want to look at one single contributing factor , you would have to point at alcohol , " dr. @entity159 says			2
@entity174 , creator of airrage.org and author of several air - travel related books including " @entity178 : crisis in the @entity180 , " agrees			1
" alcohol , " he writes , " is the leading driver of air rage			1
" in fact , many of the air rage incidents above were allegedly alcohol - related			1
fortunately , no one on my flight was outwardly enraged or inebriated , though i 'm sure , like me , many passengers were entertaining extravagant fantasies of how they 'd deal with that offending @entity8 fan and her @entity10			1
what in - flight behaviors push you to the verge of an outburst ? share your stories below .			1
