@entity0 , @entity1 -- the road to @entity4 in the northwest of @entity1 is a journey through the elements			0
@entity9 wind and rain make way for bursts of sunshine in june , a month of typically oppressive heat when illnesses such as diarrhea and typhoid are common , alongside the ever - looming specter of polio			2
it is in this stifling heat that hundreds of thousands of men , women and children are fleeing their homes in @entity26 , which borders @entity27 , to @entity0 and other neighboring regions			1
the mass exodus began after the @entity31 army launched a full scale offensive against militants on june 15 called @entity34 , or " @entity35 of @entity36			1
" while the @entity1 army has been releasing a daily stream of information regarding the operation , it has come under severe criticism for failing to notify the residents of @entity26 of an impending operation			1
a curfew in @entity26 crippled the movement of individuals in the region			1
military sources told @entity2 on condition of anonymity that the curfew had been imposed to prevent militants from fleeing , however what resulted was utter chaos for local residents			1
" we waited for the signal to leave while taking shelter under trees , " @entity57 , a local from the @entity26 town of @entity60 tells @entity2 in anguish			1
" the bazaar was under fire from mortar shells and our women and children were crying in despair			0
" exodus from @entity1 's troubled north presents risks , opportunities mass exodus on june 18 , three days after the operation officially started in @entity26 , the army finally lifted the curfew allowing movement out of the area			1
what started as a mass exodus of the region 's population has fast accelerated into a humanitarian crisis			0
according to @entity89 , the director of the @entity90 , the number of people who have fled the military operation has now reached almost half a million , with 455,000 people scattered across various parts of @entity1			1
in a sports complex in the heart of @entity0 city , a dust storm is creating havoc at the city 's largest food distribution point for those seeking shelter			1
until tuesday it was the only food distribution point for the thousands of needy people in @entity0 and its surrounding regions , and was the scene of protests airing the frustration they have experienced over the past two weeks			1
wednesday saw hundreds of men , young and old , queue up outside on the streets , shielding their eyes from the grit , waiting to receive their ration of fortified wheat , iodized salt , pulses and cooking oil			2
a significant army presence is overseeing the distribution that has been organized by the @entity120			1
@entity121 of wheat are heaped in mounds in the center of the stadium and a strong hot wind is blowing cardboard cartons into the air			2
an old woman in a tattered burqa , clutching a wisp of paper bearing her registration number , waits for her turn to collect food			2
" three of my grandchildren died after a bomb fell on our house in the @entity141 khel village of @entity26 " she says			2
" they were five , six and seven years old , " she whispers			0
" that 's when we fled			2
" request for more supplies the number of families arriving has exceeded the number estimated by the @entity120			1
according to @entity149 , the @entity120 's director in @entity1 , a contingency plan had been updated to deal with a military operation in @entity26			1
however , she says @entity31 authorities only officially approached the @entity120 for help on june 20 , five days after the strikes began			1
@entity120 had expected the families to be an average size of six but , according to @entity158 , families fleeing out of @entity26 are made up of 14 people			1
this has lead to rations being distributed on a biweekly basis instead of the usual monthly schedule			0
" we are requesting donors to provide more supplies but the situation is currently under control , " @entity158 tells @entity2			0
@entity169 , a tribal leader and an @entity170 , has been volunteering at the food distribution point ever since he arrived in @entity0 last week			2
as @entity170 wheelbarrow their supplies out of the complex , he sighs and says that it is the ordinary people of @entity26 who have had to bear the biggest brunt of the tussle between the army and the @entity31 @entity179			1
as the sun sets on another day of dust and desperation , he quotes the oft - repeated phrase addressing the conflict in @entity1 's northern regions			0
" the army are the angels and the @entity179 call themselves the companions of the holy prophet , " he says			0
" perhaps we 're the only infidels in this chaos , who suffer the most in this living hell while the other two claim that they 're bound for paradise			0
" ' that place is like fire ' there is one refuge for the hordes of people who have spilt out of @entity26			2
the army , along with funding from @entity203 and the @entity204 ( @entity204 ) , has set up a camp in @entity207 , @entity0 district			0
in the searing june heat , it sits a mere 15 kilometers ( 9.3 miles ) from the @entity211 check post , the final exit for villagers leaving @entity26 and entering @entity0 district			1
according to military sources , the camp became operational on june 16 , a day after the military operation began			0
it has , however , come under severe criticism by the very people it was built to help			0
many are instead choosing to stay with relatives or rent homes in cities such as @entity0 , @entity226 and @entity227			0
" when the curfew was eased we reached @entity0 after a two - day journey on foot , yet we would never stay at that camp			0
that place is like fire , it 's like fire , i would never take my family to that land of flaming heat , " @entity232 from the village of @entity234 in @entity26 tells @entity2 as he stands in line to get food in @entity0			1
but a visit to the camp paints a different picture			0
temperatures may be rising to as high as 47 degrees centigrade but efforts are underway to create what military guides to the camp call " a model village			0
" there is electricity , plumbing , fancy fans that spray mist and visiting doctors			0
polio workers administer vaccines to every man , woman and child entering the camp to prevent any outbreak			0
yet the place is a ghost town			0
according to military sources only 28 families have chosen to live at the camp , a fraction of those who have left @entity26			1
it remains empty for the time being but with the month of @entity277 fast approaching and the operation not looking to end anytime soon , military officials overseeing the camp expect it to be operational and fully populated for at least two months			2
