-- in @entity2 , the @entity1 are angry			1
for eleven months , many of their leaders have stood firmly behind the regime of president @entity6			2
however , @entity2 's new constitution explicitly says in @entity10 3 that the president of the country has to be a muslim , thereby barring @entity1 from the right to run for the top post			1
on sunday , pro-government @entity2 went to the polls to approve the new constitution			1
in protest of @entity10 , @entity1 voted with a " no , " while the opposition movement boycotted the election altogether , saying that it was inconceivable for it to take place while the country is up in flames			2
nevertheless , the new constitution passed			0
the controversial clause in @entity10 has been around for a long time , ever since @entity2 established its first constitution in 1920			2
both secular and @entity24 @entity2 have over the years tried to amend the clause but to no avail			2
in 1973 , president @entity26 released a constitutional draft that omitted reference to @entity29 as the official religion of the state , which enraged conservative @entity32			2
faced with pressure , @entity6 eventually restored @entity10 3 to its original form			0
but now , as @entity35 sweeps across the @entity37 world , @entity2 needs to rethink its old ways			0
what the government should realize is that it 's bad politics to bar any religious group from running for presidency			1
if a @entity45 from @entity46 has a possibility of running for the job , then why ca n't a @entity24 from @entity49 ? @entity1 make up 12 % of the 23 million people in @entity2			1
even if a @entity24 has a right to run for president , it is unlikely that he will win since the majority of @entity2 's population which is made of 75 % @entity57 would never vote for a @entity24			1
so , the @entity32 should have nothing to fear and allow @entity1 the right to run for the office of the presidency			1
moreover , @entity2 @entity1 have until now been overwhelmingly supportive of the regime , fearing that if the regime collapses , then @entity64 groups like the @entity65 would rise to power and focus on marginalizing the @entity1			1
the scenarios in @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 have not been encouraging			0
while the older generation among the @entity1 is more or less rallied behind the government , the younger generation is less ideological and more forward - looking			2
the @entity78 - educated , @entity77 - savvy @entity1 refuse to buy the argument that says : " it 's either the @entity80 , the @entity29 , or chaos			2
" like the young and ambitious @entity2 in the broader population , they want to see a democratic transformation of the country and are confident that they will become an integral part of its future , regardless of who rises to power			0
the urban @entity1 , especially those in @entity49 and @entity91 , often argue that they have been around long before the @entity32 came along ; and as such , they are entitled to live , work and have the right to govern the country like their countrymen			1
despite the efforts of @entity1 , there were heavy pressures for the government to include @entity10 3 in the new constitution			1
given the rise of @entity29 zeal throughout @entity2 , there is fear that the public would be outraged if @entity1 are allowed the right to run for president			1
since violence erupted last march , the government has been trying hard to appease the religious clerics who have been very influential in the @entity111 demonstrations			0
many of the clerics , needless to say , are religious dictators			0
the regime has tried to win over the clerics by bending to their demands , like shutting down the @entity49 casino or allowing the establishment of an @entity29 tv channel -- @entity121 -- that contradicts everything the secular @entity80 had stood for since the mid- 1960s			0
@entity10 3 , of course , is not the only problem with the new constitution			0
the power given to the presidency is enormous			0
@entity2 's government still feels that it can keep a presidential term at 7 years , renewable only once , although oppositions have demanded that the term be set at five years , renewable only once			1
the new constitution also gives the president the right to name a prime minister rather than vesting that authority in parliament and the right to fire a cabinet unilaterally			0
it still keeps the executive and legislative branches as subordinate to the president and allows him to name the head of the @entity146 ( @entity147 )			0
although the flawed constitution is hailed as a great achievement by @entity2 's state media , many @entity2 have become disenchanted , to say the least			1
eleven months into the uprisings , @entity2 are weary and tired			0
no longer do they just want an end to the one - party rule -- they now wish for real democracy , where justice , accountability and the rule of law can bring order to public life			0
they want a constitution that gives @entity32 and @entity1 equal access to all jobs , including the presidency			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			0

in @entity2 , a newly approved constitution says that only @entity32 can be president
@entity166 : despite their support for the regime , @entity1 ca n't run for president
he says while the government is pressured to *stipulate* this rule , it 's bad politics
@entity166 : many @entity2 want a constitution that treat @entity32 and @entity1 *fairly*
