-- days of violent unrest in the @entity3 capital have left dozens dead and hundreds injured , as security forces clashed with anti-government protesters , with the demonstrators finally surrendering on wednesday evening			1
@entity8 turned into a war zone wednesday , as @entity3 military forces cracked down on anti-government protesters , ending a tense standoff that has troubled the capital for weeks			1
the chaotic day left at least five people dead , as @entity8 residents endured an edgy and unsettled night			1
wednesday 's violent clashes cap a months - long standoff between @entity3 authorities and protesters opposed to the government of prime minister @entity20			1
the protesters -- known as the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) -- support @entity23 , who was prime minister from 2001 to 2006 , before he was ousted in a bloodless coup			1
what has happened up till now ? the latest violence follows a government pledge to hold an election in november in an attempt to halt the protests			1
however , amid ongoing anger over a crackdown by security forces last month and a refusal by the protesters to comply with a deadline to vacate the district of @entity8 -- until wednesday -- authorities say the election date is now under threat			1
prime minister @entity20 declared a state of emergency april 7 , hours after anti-government demonstrators ( known as " @entity42 " for the clothes they wear ) stormed the country 's parliament			2
following protests that have paralyzed parts of @entity8 for months , the army surged on wednesday into @entity51 , with armored personnel carriers crushing bamboo and tire barricades , while protesters hurled @entity57 grenades at soldiers			1
witnesses reported a dozen buildings -- including a bank , a police station , a local television station and @entity3 's biggest shopping mall -- set ablaze			2
at least five people , including an @entity68 journalist , were listed as killed by the @entity69 in @entity8			1
another 64 -- two journalists among them -- were wounded			2
what happens next ? @entity3 's prime minister sought to calm public fears with a televised address in which he expressed confidence that peace would soon be restored			0
" i would like to give moral support to officers who are doing their duties now and would like to reassure you , " prime minister @entity20 told citizens			2
" and i am confident that we can overcome all the problems and bring the country to a long - lasting peace			0
" he said that the government had regained full control and that @entity22 leaders had fled or had been taken into police custody			2
seven anti-government protest leaders had been taken into custody , while several others fled , authorities said			0
the prime minister 's office issued a statement wednesday blaming the crackdown on failed talks between the two sides			0
" negotiations failed because core ( opposition ) leaders are not able to make decisions by themselves , " the statement said , alluding to an outside force influencing the protesters			0
" ( we ) ask core leaders to stop the rally and surrender			0
" on wednesday , it seemed that the time for talking had passed			0
how long have protests being going on ? @entity3 has been embroiled in political chaos for years , and many @entity3 citizens are growing weary with the instability			0
ever since @entity23 came to power in 2001 , there were protesters opposing his allegedly corrupt and autocratic rule			1
those protesters donned yellow shirts ( the color of the king ) and occupied the two main airports in @entity8 , until finally the @entity127 government was brought down by a court ruling			1
in revenge @entity23 's supporters copied the yellow - shirt tactics with a variation , and took to the streets in red shirts			1
but the rift is largely between the @entity42 and the so - called " multi-colored shirts " ( who support @entity20 , the current prime minister )			0
the multi-colored shirts , generally middle - class city dwellers , are displeased with the disruption caused by the protests			0
they are not pro- or anti-government			0
they simply want the government to shut down the @entity147 to end the violence and interruptions to daily life			0
why do the sides identify themselves by colors ? it 's an easy way for them to create an identity			0
it all started with the @entity157 wearing a color associated with monday , the day of the week that @entity3 's revered king was born on			0
that was designed to show their allegiance to the king and more broadly the traditional elite which has dominated @entity3 politics for years			0
@entity23 's supporters then picked a color to distinguish themselves from the @entity157			1
why are they arguing ? essentially this is a classic power struggle			0
it 's easy to portray this as simply rich against poor , but it is much more complicated than that , as illustrated by the fact that the @entity147 ' leader is in fact a multi-billionaire			0
@entity23 rode to power by enacting populist policies which gained huge support from the rural poor			1
his radical approach ruffled a lot of feathers among the elite , who felt he was becoming too big for his boots and feared his policies would erode their position			0
the " civil society " also become concerned over allegations of corruption and @entity23 's brutal war on drugs , which saw summary executions			1
he was also criticized for his heavy handed response to violence in the @entity195 - dominated south			0
finally , the army ousted @entity23 in a coup , which had the backing of the aristocratic elite and much of the middle class , who were becoming uneasy with the cult of personality growing around the leader			1
that set the stage for an embittered power struggle between @entity23 loyalists and those loyal to the army , aristocracy and their traditional @entity212			1
from his self - imposed exile abroad to avoid a trial on corruption charges , @entity23 released a statement wednesday saying that he was not the leader of the @entity22 , the formal name of the @entity22 opposition , and that their movement calling for new elections is not on his behalf			1
" they did not demand anything for me or on my behalf			0
i am not @entity22 , " he said			0
@entity23 also accused the @entity3 government of defaming him by saying he was the mastermind behind the violence in the country 's ongoing political crisis			1
so who is @entity23 ? visionary leader or venal despot : opinions vary , like the color of the shirts his supporters and detractors wear			1
if you sport red , you think @entity23 was the only prime minister to offer the rural poor a voice and real benefits ; if you wear yellow , you view him as opponents of the @entity245 ' @entity244 saw that leader : greedy and dangerous			1
what is not in dispute is that @entity23 won two elections , was the only @entity3 prime minister to serve a full - term in office and is still hugely popular			1
but critics say he bought his support and was only in politics to help himself			0
as a businessman , @entity23 made billions of dollars from his communications company , @entity256			2
in 2008 he was found guilty and sentenced in absentia to two years in prison for a land deal that enabled his wife to buy a valuable city plot for a fraction of its true value			0
@entity23 also faces other corruption charges			2
more than $ 2 billion in @entity23 's family assets are currently frozen in @entity3 , but there is speculation he has a great deal more money elsewhere			2
what are the wider implications of the protests ? if the divisions in @entity3 ca n't be healed , it could lead to a deteriorating security situation which would have wider implications for the region			0
@entity3 's relations with @entity280 are especially frosty , since @entity23 was appointed economic adviser to @entity280 prime minister @entity282 the worst case scenario would see @entity280 drawn into the dispute , with @entity23 using the country as a political base , adding to the already considerable tensions on the border			2
is @entity3 safe for visitors ? many western embassies have shut their doors and are warning their citizens against travel to @entity8 , as violence in the city continues			2
" due to escalating violence in central @entity8 , including gunfire near the @entity298 embassy , demonstrations in @entity300 , and other incidents throughout @entity3 , @entity298 citizens should defer all travel to @entity8 and defer all non-essential travel to the rest of @entity3 , " the @entity296 has warned			2
as well as advising against travel to @entity8 , the @entity308 's @entity307 warned of protests and violent incidents in popular tourist destinations such as @entity312 , @entity300 , @entity313 and @entity314			1
but @entity8 's main suvarnabhumi airport is operating normally , according to its web site .			2
