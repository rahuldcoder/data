@entity0 -- @entity3 's change of leadership that began last week comes as domestic pressure mounts for the world 's second largest economy to toughen its foreign policy to match its economic might			1
yet @entity0 is keen to prevent the world from concluding that @entity3 has discarded the notion of a peaceful rise			1
the result has been reactive assertiveness ; a foreign policy tactic perfected during @entity3 's ongoing maritime disputes			1
this approach allows @entity0 to use perceived provocations as a chance to change the status - quo in its favor -- all the while insisting the other party started the trouble			1
those expecting @entity3 to turn the other cheek are mistaken			2
the prolonged stand - off with @entity28 over the sovereignty of a few islets offers a vivid example of this approach			2
in september , the @entity28 government announced that it was finalizing the purchase from their private owner of the disputed islands -- called @entity38 by @entity28 and @entity38 by @entity3 -- in the @entity39			1
but @entity0 interpreted the move as a betrayal of the two countries ' agreement to shelve their quarrel , and saw the timing as a deliberate attempt to disrupt the leadership transition and foment instability at a vulnerable moment			0

" these measures ranged from the verbal -- leader - to - be @entity55 labeling @entity28 's purchase of the islands a " farce " -- to economic retaliation and large - scale anti-japan protests and naval exercises in the @entity39			2
but the real game - changer in the stand - off came when @entity0 declared its territorial baselines around the islands ; a move that legally places them under @entity3 administration			1
once the announcement was made , @entity3 began to regularly dispatch law enforcement vessels to patrol waters off the disputed islands , directly challenging @entity28 's de facto control of the area for the past 40 years			1
such is the new normal , claim @entity3 officials			0
in recent weeks , @entity3 media have been trumpeting the efforts of @entity3 ships to expel @entity28 @entity81 boats			1
reminding the world that the troubles were all started by @entity84 , @entity3 claims that the burden is entirely on @entity28 to find a way out of the mess			1

when @entity97 maladroitly responded to a fishing run - in by sending a warship , @entity3 took the opportunity to strengthen its claim over the disputed shoal by deploying law enforcement vessels to the area , extending its annual unilateral fishing ban to cover the waters around the shoal ; quarantining tropical fruit imports from the @entity93 and suspending tourism ; and roping off the mouth of the lagoon to prevent other fishermen from entering			1
by maintaining regular law enforcement patrols and preventing @entity93 fishermen from entering those waters , @entity3 has managed to establish a new status - quo in its favor			2
a similar blueprint was then used in june in response to a maritime law passed by @entity120 with new navigation regulations covering the disputed @entity122 and @entity123			0
before the ink on the law had dried , @entity3 upgraded the administrative status of @entity127 encompassing a group of disputed islands in the @entity96 and established a military garrison			0
furthermore , the @entity131 ( @entity131 ) offered oil exploration leases in nine blocks located within @entity120 's @entity134 , which overlap with blocks offered by @entity136			0
a key component of @entity0 's counter-punches are the use of economic punishments , including suspending imports , halting tourism , encouraging boycotts , offering up oil blocks in disputed areas , or impeding fishing access			2
in contrast to a time when foreign policy was designed to serve economic growth , @entity3 is now increasingly using its economic might to advance political ends -- even when this hurts @entity3 itself			1
according to one @entity3 analyst , " these measures will hurt @entity3			0
but they hurt @entity28 more "			0

it also wanted to avoid " punching the new @entity3 leadership in the face " just after the transition			0
now , analysts in @entity0 claim that a @entity168 has been opened and there is no going back to the tacit agreement that has kept peace in the @entity39 for decades			0
read more : why @entity3 's reforms have hit a brick wall right now , @entity0 is primarily preoccupied with maintaining the momentum of economic development and preventing domestic troubles from erupting into potentially destabilizing unrest			1
the new leaders will not want to look weak , thus blunting the edge of their " reactively assertive " foreign policy			2
if there is any perceived slight , no matter how minor , expect @entity3 to pounce			2
