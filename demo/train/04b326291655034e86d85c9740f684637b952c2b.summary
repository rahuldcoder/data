-- @entity1 has become a vital tool over the past few years , allowing folks to chronicle everything from the @entity6 plane crash to performances of @entity8			1
a recent study from the @entity10 at @entity10 suggests the microblogging site can improve relationships in @entity13 ( that 's @entity15 )			1
but it 's also become a venue by which people may -- to put it plainly -- overshare			1
there 's a big difference between tweeting about something personal in an interesting , relevant fashion ( like when blogger @entity25 live - tweeted his naturalization oath ceremony ) and telling your poor @entity1 followers every thought that crosses your cranium ( " i like pigeons ! " " quarters are shiny ! " " my left boob is bigger than my right ! " )			1
it can be tough to recognize when you 're beating the @entity40 drum just a little too loudly -- the need for a reaction from your followers can often outweigh your better judgment -- but sometimes a simple edit is all you need to avoid the dreaded " unfollow			1
" observe : the @entity40 tweet : " @entity47 ! i 'm going to @entity49 with my super hot gf & we 're gon na lie in the sun ! ! # @entity53 ! " why people hate you : hmm , let 's see : you 're going on a freaking cruise while the average follower is sitting in a cubicle counting down the miserable moments until another sad @entity61 with his / her single friends			1
maybe people are , i dunno , jealous ? twit fix : " excited for a well - deserved vacay			2
can anyone suggest must - see spots in @entity69 ? " if you share your joy while also asking for advice , you engage your followers , thereby alleviating the tedium of their comparatively bleak days			1
be sure to tweet back at those kind enough to answer			2
the @entity40 tweet : " i just ate a bagel , some chips and a @entity78			2
" why people hate you : first , you said " tummy			2
" second , no one cares			0
third , you 're whining , and that 's annoying			1
twit fix : " just had a great wrap at @entity86 in @entity87			0
get the marinated tofu -- healthy and delish			0
" if you insist on telling everyone what you had for lunch , at least have a good lunch			0
moaning about pretty much any banal @entity94 problem on @entity1 rates high on the annoying scale			1
instead , offer your readers some kind of value -- i.e. a fabulous alternative to the brown bag lunch @entity102 packed ( yes , some of your followers likely still live at home )			1
the @entity40 tweet : " i just went on the best date ever with the hottest guy ever and i think i love him ! " why people hate you : in this case , you 're more likely to inspire fear rather than outright hate ( unless your jealous ex follows you -- and he totally does )			0
if your new love interest sees your tweet , it could come off as a little intense and scare him away			0
plus , it sends a signal that you 'll probably dish more sordid details as the relationship develops -- and no one wants his sex life to become a trending topic			0
twit fix : " for some reason i have this jam stuck in my head [ insert link to ambiguously lovey - dovey song here ]			0
" ( tools like @entity136 and @entity137 make this super easy			0
) if homeboy happens to see this tweet , he will be sweetly intrigued			0
also , you 're providing your followers ( remember them ? -- the people who actually read your tweets because they care what you have to say ? ) with a new tune			1
the @entity40 tweet : " [ @entity155 name here ] is about as intelligent as that kid in @entity148 who sat in the corner , eating googly - eyes and drooling on the teacher 's shoulder			2
" why people hate you : @entity158			0
your followers actually would love you for this -- [ insert name here ] , not so much			2
twit fix : @entity1 feuds are about as classy as vajazzling ( which is to say , not at all			1
) just refrain from getting out the claws , or if you must let your negative ions rip , limit your rants to an e-mail to your snarkiest friend ( the one with whom you get frequent gossip hangovers )			0
better yet , may we suggest creating a venomous blog complete with an alter ego ? hey , it worked for us ...			0
