-- @entity1 walked out of @entity2 after 20 years , hoping to become a productive member of society			0
shortly after she was released in june 2010 , @entity1 found a part - time job			1
she was thrilled -- until she found out that working for $ 13 an hour meant her newly acquired @entity7 insurance would be terminated			1
@entity7 , a federally run health program , is designed to provide coverage for low - income and disabled individuals			1
but in @entity15 , where @entity1 lives , single adults without dependents who earn more than $ 8,994 a year do n't qualify			0
in other states , the qualifying income level is even lower			2
adults without children in nearly half of states do n't qualify at all			2
it 's a population known as the working poor : they earn too much to qualify for @entity7 but not nearly enough to pay for private health insurance			1
@entity1 chose to keep her job and prayed she would n't fall ill. @entity28 worries constantly about her atopic dermatitis , a skin condition that can be controlled only with a prescription medication cream she ca n't afford			0
" i have to pick and choose when i go to the doctor , " @entity1 said			0
" when i get really , really sick , i have to go to the emergency room			0
" experts hope @entity35 will change that			2
they estimate that 30 % to 50 % of released @entity38 prison inmates will be newly eligible for insurance under the @entity7 expansion that covers people who earn up to 133 % of the federal poverty level : about $ 15,800 a year for a single person			1
twenty - five states and the @entity45 have chosen to expand their @entity7 programs			1
and all states must now cover behavioral health treatments at the same rate as they cover physical ailments			1
so any inmate who qualifies for @entity7 or @entity52 , and those who can afford health insurance , will be able to get help for substance abuse and mental health problems			1
that care could be the " stay out of jail free " card former inmates need , experts say			1
whether the infrastructure is in place to support those dreams is another question			1
a chronic problem roughly 10 million people cycle through @entity38 jails every year , according to @entity70 , a nonprofit dedicated to improving connectivity between health care in and out of the justice system			2
most are there for short periods before they are determined to be innocent , post bail or are sentenced to probation			0
only 4 % are sent to prison to serve longer sentences			2
" in other words , 96 % ... return directly to the community from jail , along with their often untreated health conditions , " nonprofit president @entity80 explained			1
those who end up in prison often have serious health issues			2
nearly 40 % percent of inmates have one or more chronic health problems , such as high blood pressure , diabetes or asthma , the @entity89 ( @entity90 ) estimated in 2002			1
inmates are also three times more likely than the general population to suffer from a serious mental illness and four times more likely to have a substance abuse problem , said @entity102 , senior adviser to the assistant attorney general in the @entity38 @entity104			1
the @entity105 estimates that 64.2 % of jail inmates have a diagnosable mental health problem , compared with about 26 % of @entity38 adults			1
most private health insurance companies do not cover the incarcerated			2
inmates who were covered under @entity7 upon entering prison have their insurance suspended or terminated , depending on state law , because of @entity7 's " inmate exception " rule			1
but the real problem is not caring for this population inside , @entity117 said ; it 's caring for them when they get out			0
until the @entity35 takes effect january 1 , inmates are some of the only people in the @entity38 who are guaranteed access to health care			1
to deprive them of medical care would violate the @entity130 , which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment , the @entity127 has ruled on two occasions			0
" a prison that deprives prisoners of basic sustenance , including adequate medical care , is incompatible with the concept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society , " justice @entity133 wrote in the more recent @entity135 opinion ( @entity90 ) on may 23 , 2011			0
but when they leave prison , and most do , there are no such protections in place			0
men and women who may have gotten their addictions under control or found the right medication combination to ease mental health symptoms behind bars are released into the community without a backup plan			1
@entity80 tells of newly released prisoners who purposefully commit small crimes with the intent of returning to jail to get the surgeries they need for free			1
" access to health care can make a huge positive difference for this population , " @entity117 said			2
" if we deliver the right treatment to the right people at the right time , then we can improve public health , increase public safety and save taxpayer dollars			1
" separate worlds advocates working to get former inmates the health care they need in the community have a favorite catchphrase : continuity of care			1
the goal is to have an appointment set up with a provider before the inmate is even released , said @entity188 , @entity189 's director of inmate health services			1
the former warden remembers how his calls to community doctors used to go : " can you see this patient ? he 's been incarcerated for 10 years			2
he 's mentally ill. he 's violent			0
and he has no insurance , so he is n't going to be able to pay for anything			0
" " it did n't work out too well , " @entity188 said with a hint of sarcasm			0
" at least today , i 've taken one thing off the table			0
... you 'll be able to be reimbursed			0
" there are n't a lot of data on whether access to health care will lower rates of recidivism or the rates at which offenders return to jail			2
but experts know that treatment of mental illness and substance abuse can help prevent criminal relapse ( @entity90 )			1
a study done in the early 1990s called the @entity219 and @entity220 ( @entity90 ) found that substance abuse treatment , in and out of prison , reduced the level of criminal activity among participants by about two - thirds			2
since then , many studies have showed that addiction programs , whether participation is coerced or voluntary , reduce recidivism rates			0
@entity233 's @entity232 program identifies prisoners who pose a threat to public safety and provides them with mental health treatment for up to five years after their release			1
the state program has reduced felony recidivism by 42 % among these former inmates , according to a 2009 report ( @entity90 ) , and has saved taxpayers $ 1.64 for every dollar spent on treatment			1
" the guy who robs banks for a living and sells drugs for a living , that 's what he does , " @entity188 said			0
" and when he gets back out , he 's going to do it again			0
but when ( the mentally ill ) get out , they do n't rush back in			0
" judges would avoid sending these low - risk offenders to jail at all if more treatment options were available , said @entity259 , president and ceo of @entity262 ' @entity261			2
but state funding for community behavioral programs has long been lacking			2
@entity259 believes it 's only a matter of time until other states recognize the benefits of expanding their @entity7 programs			1
experts have also expressed concern that the physician shortage in the @entity38 will only get worse in coming years due to the influx of newly insured patients			1
and although the " @entity279 " provision of @entity35 provides funding for facilities willing to coordinate primary , emergency and behavioral health care for individuals on @entity7 with chronic conditions , this kind of seamless communication between treatment providers simply does not currently exist in most cities			1
" we are building the plane as we fly it , " @entity259 said simply			0
" and if anybody tells you differently , they are misdirecting you			0
" reaching out the bottom line is that the @entity35 holds a lot of potential , said dr. @entity296 , co-founder of the @entity297 , which encompasses 11 community health centers caring for recently released prisoners			1
but she cautions that it may not be the cure - all some are promising for @entity38 's inmates			2
" just because everyone is insured does n't mean you have access to primary care			0
... just because you have insurance does n't mean you want to go to a clinic or doctor , " @entity308 said			0
" it does n't mean you wo n't feel discriminated in a health care setting			2
it does n't mean you 'll feel safe			0
" former inmates are looking for four specific things when it comes to health care outside prison walls , she said : access to providers within two weeks of release ; doctors who know they have been incarcerated so they do n't feel they have to hide their past ; community health workers who can help them navigate the system ; and a health care facility that has strong partnerships with other organizations in the community that can help them find housing , employment and legal services			1
all are essential to encouraging this population to seek consistent care and stay out of jail , @entity308 said			0
@entity340 is working to address some of these issues as a policy specialist at @entity343 , an advocacy group in @entity15 run by formerly incarcerated women			0
" i realized upon being released from prison that we usually cling to people who have been in the same situation as us , " she said			0
" i was lucky to have a great support system ... so i made myself out to be that support system for sisters and brothers coming home			0
" @entity1 plans to apply for @entity7 again under @entity15 's expansion			1
until it goes into effect , @entity1 said , she will continue to use " home remedies " to treat her skin condition and will avoid going to the doctor unless it 's absolutely necessary			0
" my biggest fear is that when i do get insurance , i 'm going to have something wrong with me , " she said			0
" it 's going to be too late			0

experts estimate 30 % to 50 % of released inmates will be newly eligible for @entity7
even states that will not expand @entity7 will provide coverage for mental health treatment
the infrastructure to support inmates in the community may not be available right away
