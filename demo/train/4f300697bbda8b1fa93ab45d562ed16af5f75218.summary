@entity0 -- tests on the ruptured @entity3 well in the @entity4 will go on for another 24 hours as federal and company officials try to explain " anomalous " pressure readings and possible leaks , the federal government 's point man on the spill said monday			1
" there is no indication at this time this is any indication of a significant problem in the well bore , but we are running every one of these anomalies down , " former @entity13 adm. @entity12 told reporters monday afternoon			0
the pressures recorded on the well in the four days since it was temporarily " shut in " are lower than expected , @entity12 said			0
meanwhile , there are possible leaks of methane gas from around the well and from the inoperative blowout preventer , as well as a separate and possibly unrelated seep from the ocean floor about 3 kilometers ( about 2 miles ) away , he said			1
@entity12 said scientists and engineers are still debating whether the low pressure is caused by either the well 's depletion after three months of oil spewing into the @entity4 or whether oil is leaking from the well into the surrounding sea floor			2
" there are arguments to be made on both sides , " he said			0
" but those discussions continue , and we 're trying to develop information that will allow us to do that			0
" he said a joint in the capping stack placed over the damaged well appeared to be leaking a combination of oil and methane , but there appeared to be no sign that it was hindering the equipment now being used to contain the worst oil spill in @entity53 history			2
some seepage from the ocean floor is normal in the @entity4 , according to @entity59 professor @entity58			0
but he said there are weak points in the well bore , and it 's " very hard to tell the difference " between a depleted well and a leaking well			0
" if there is a leak , you should be able to see the oil and gas infiltrating into a rock unit at about that level , and they have not seen that , " he said			2
@entity12 had extended testing sunday as well , pointing out " a number of unanswered questions " about the monitoring systems being used to conduct the tests			0
earlier monday , he said the tests would continue only if @entity3 was " rigorously " watching for any signs that the pressure tests could make the situation worse			1
engineers and scientists have intensified monitoring of the well , poring over images and data collected by robots , sonar scans , and seismic and acoustic examinations			0
a government ship is in the area , fitted with equipment for detecting methane gas , which would be an indication of a leak			1
" at any moment , we have the ability to return to the safe containment of the oil on the surface until the time the relief well is completed and the well is permanently killed , " @entity12 said			0
in the coming weeks , @entity3 also plans to bring in two more oil collection ships in addition to the two in the @entity4 , bringing containment capacity to 80,000 barrels ( about 3.4 million gallons ) of oil a day , more than high - end estimates of how much oil had been leaking			1
@entity13 rear adm. @entity112 , @entity12 's deputy on the scene , said the @entity114 and the @entity115 , two of the ships disconnected from the well to put on the containment cap , could be quickly re-connected within hours if scientists decide that 's necessary			0
in addition , @entity3 also plans to conduct tests known as ranging runs on one of its relief wells , which company officials have said could intersect the ruptured well by the end of july and provide the permanent solution to the leak			1
@entity3 then plans to pump mud and cement down to kill the ruptured well			2
pressure continues to rise steadily at about 1 pound @entity133 per hour and was about 6,811 pounds monday evening , @entity3 senior vice president @entity131 told reporters			2
@entity131 said gas bubbles reported coming from the well casing could be nitrogen used in the well 's cementing process , but others near the well head contained about 15 percent methane			1
a breach in the casing would be signaled by a drop in pressure or possibly the release of methane gas , which is sometimes a precursor to oil rising through the formation , he said			1
continuing with the testing is " absolutely the best way for us to go forward , " @entity131 said			2
the well , located about 5,000 feet below the surface of the @entity4 and about 40 miles off the mouth of the @entity156 , erupted april 20 with the sinking of the offshore drilling rig @entity159			0
no oil has gushed out since thursday , when @entity3 closed all the valves in a new custom - made cap that was lowered into place earlier in the week			1
that lull in oil flow has jump - started the federal claims process			1
@entity167 , the man in charge of disbursing the $ 20 billion in funds @entity3 is setting aside to resolve @entity4 oil spill - related claims , said monday that now that the oil leak has apparently been stopped , it will be a lot easier and quicker to get a handle on the universal claims			1
at a question - and - answer discussion in @entity0 , @entity167 said it has been difficult to come up with a budget because officials did not know how pervasive the spill would become			2
" now that the oil has stopped , with my fingers crossed , we will quickly come up with an overall budget , " he said			0
@entity167 said the fund was being established by @entity3 with the support of the @entity188 administration as an alternative to years of protracted litigation , and said the challenge is to make the reparations process attractive enough so people will voluntarily seek compensation from it			1
@entity1 's @entity196 and @entity197 contributed to this report .			0

new : extending tests is " absolutely the best way " forward , @entity3 says
new : an expert says no signs indicate a well casing breach
officials are working to identify possible leaks of methane gas
the lull in gushing oil is allowing the government to jump - start its claims process
