-- every year , a combination of power , performance and perfection brings over 200,000 motorsport devotees to an @entity7 country estate for the @entity8			0
motorsport fans have long regarded @entity10 as the pinnacle of all racing cars and @entity14 car designers have responded by pushing the boundaries of speed since the @entity17 started in 1950			1
in the 1970s , @entity19 's designers pioneered the turbo engine for use in @entity10			1
the visceral acceleration of the turbo cars was well known , the speed intoxicating for both the drivers and the fans but it was not widely well received by some in the industry			2
four - time world champion @entity30 began his @entity10 career at the start of the turbo - engine era , and says it was something of a laughing stock when @entity19 unveiled its @entity36			1
" when @entity19 introduced the first turbo engine everybody was laughing -- especially in @entity7 , " @entity30 told @entity0			1
" the turbo engine was very different to other engines			1
you had more power -- more top - end power			2
but the weight of the car was much bigger , " explained @entity30			2
" we were learning all the time			0
the team was getting more and more experienced and being very curious , working very close with the engineers , i really loved it			0
" turbo technology was slow to take off , but once it did , it paved the way for an exciting new era in f1 racing			0
it was n't until 1979 -- two years after its launch -- that @entity19 's turbo - charged car finally won the @entity57 @entity56 , driven by @entity58			1
" as much as i loved experimenting with the new design , it was a very frustrating time too , " said @entity30			0
" we very often blew up the turbo , blew up the engine , but it was part of the time and i think everyone has accepted it			2
however their domination in the sport was relatively short - lived following safety concerns			1
after a raft of restrictions , the @entity10 governing body , @entity73 , eventually banned turbo - equipped engines in 1988			1
it seems though that @entity19 will have the last laugh as from next year , all @entity14 cars will be required to have turbo engines			1
some are saying that it involves the biggest rule change in the sport 's history			0
gone will be the current 2.4 - litre normally aspirated @entity87 , which have been in service since the start of 2006 , and in their place will be 1.6 - litre turbo @entity91			2
each engine will also be limited to 100 kilograms of fuel per hour , putting an emphasis on performance combined with greater fuel economy			0
@entity19 's new turbo engine , dubbed " @entity14 - 2014 , " may have evolved since the early days of turbo technology , but it still owes a debt to the engineers who revolutionized racing with the world 's fastest " teapot			1

when @entity19 unveiled its first @entity14 turbo - charged car in 1977 , became a laughing stock
