according to the affidavit , @entity13 said he 'd built some explosive devices with items available at hardware stores			1
he said you 'd need a " formula " to know how to make them blow up -- and they had a " kill zone " of 20 meters and a " hurt zone " of 60 meters			0
the devices , he said , are " not firecrackers , not things to play with : ( they are ) life or death			0
" the undercover agent told @entity13 he was going out of town to pick up illicit drugs , then met up with him tuesday evening at the suspect 's house in @entity68 , about 15 miles southwest of the @entity3 capital			2

" the suspect then showed off about six pipe bombs and 22 silver " crickets " ( small explosive devices ) and claimed that he " could manufacture anything ( the agent ) wanted , including having access to @entity108 plastic explosives and blasting caps			1
" the undercover agent left with two pipe bombs and a cricket , with @entity13 saying if he " liked them they could set up a trade for cocaine			1
" authorities later tested them , and determined they qualified as " destructive devices " under federal law			1
@entity13 's arrest came two days later			2
despite his promise of bloodshed , he was taken into custody -- away from the firepower he kept at home -- without incident			0
he is charged with one count of possession of a firearm , though more charges could be forthcoming			0

his home is in the @entity143 neighborhood , which features recently built two - story houses			2
they found a number of devices as well as grenades , which can only be obtained through the military			1
the devices were removed from the site and rendered safe , according to @entity14			0
