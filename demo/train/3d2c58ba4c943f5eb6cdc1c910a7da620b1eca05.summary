@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's bizarre introduction of rapper @entity5 at the 2004 @entity6 took center stage on the first day of a preliminary hearing for three people facing charges stemming from her death			1
@entity4 's death on february 8 , 2007 , was ruled to be from " acute combined drug intoxication			1
" prosecutors said they wanted judge @entity16 to see how the former @entity19 model and reality tv star was affected by what they alleged was an illegal conspiracy to prescribe , administer and dispense controlled substances to an addict			1
@entity24 , @entity4 's lawyer and companion , and co-defendants dr. @entity28 and dr. @entity29 each entered not guilty pleas in @entity31 in september			1
the preliminary hearing , which lawyers said could last three weeks , is an opportunity for the defense to " lock in " the testimony of prosecution witnesses , one defense lawyer said			1
it is not expected to result in any charges being dropped , he said			0
the lawyer for @entity24 , who faces 11 felony counts , said to prove a conspiracy , the prosecutor would have to show @entity24 knew it was illegal to use fake names to obtain narcotics for @entity4 , which he said was to protect her privacy			1
" he has no reason to believe that there was anything improper in what was going on , " defense lawyer @entity52 said			0
" he honestly believed that if the doctor said he could do it this way and , in fact , did it , then it was legitimate and lawful			0
" @entity4 's death in a @entity67 , @entity64 , hotel on february 8 , 2007 , was ruled to be from " acute combined drug intoxication , " the @entity63 , @entity64 , medical examiner said			1
@entity4 's introduction of @entity5 -- projected on a courtroom screen -- was a brief respite from a mostly tedious hearing spent shuffling through prescription records			1
" like my body ? " a slim and busty @entity4 asked as she showed off her tight - fitting gown			2
@entity4 slurred much of her speech as she tried to read from a teleprompter			2
" make some noise for my boy , @entity5 , " @entity4 finally yelled			2
@entity52 said the video should be viewed in the context of the medical problems @entity4 was suffering at the time			0
" we all have bad days , and she suffered from seizures and she had medical problems , " @entity52 said			0
" so , if she 's on medication for that , [ it ] would explain her activity			0
" @entity24 sat with his head in his hands at times while the government 's lead investigator described what happened the day @entity4 died at the @entity96			1
@entity97 , special agent for the @entity98 , said investigators found 12 types of prescription drugs , including dangerous opiates , in the hotel room			0
seven of them were prescribed using @entity24 's name , although spelled " @entity107 , " he said			2
two of the drugs apparently were for treatment of " flu - like symptoms " @entity4 was suffering when she arrived at the hotel three days before her death , he said			1
a hotel employee who saw @entity4 and @entity24 arrive told investigators she " was n't her normal vivacious self , " @entity97 said			2
another hotel worker who had closely assisted @entity4 during several earlier stays said she was not allowed contact with @entity4 , which she said was " very unusual , " @entity97 testified			0
the workers said they were told @entity4 was suffering from " flu - like symptoms			0
" the autopsy revealed @entity4 had a bacterial infection , @entity97 said			0
when @entity24 left the hotel on the morning of february 8 to shop for a new boat , he asked @entity128 , a registered nurse who is married to @entity4 's bodyguard , to watch over @entity4 , who he said was sleeping , the investigator said			1
@entity128 sat next to the bed , surfing the internet with a laptop and talking on her cell phone , believing @entity4 was sleeping , he said			0
finally , @entity134 , described as a friend of @entity4 's , noticed her lips were turning blue and her skin was pale , he said			1
when the nurse was unable to find a pulse , she called her husband , @entity141			0
he then called the hotel desk , where an employee called for paramedics			0
cpr efforts by the bodyguard and paramedics failed to revive @entity4 , who was then taken to @entity149 , where she was pronounced dead , the investigator said			0
a series of affidavits used by state investigators to obtain search warrants in their 2Â½ - year investigation was unsealed last month , revealing many details , including an account of one witness who told investigators she saw @entity24 inject @entity4 with drugs			1
other affidavits included a medical expert 's conclusion that @entity4 , whose real name was @entity4 , was given drugs in " excessive amounts " and a pharmacist who said he had refused to fill a prescription for a long list of strong narcotics .			2
