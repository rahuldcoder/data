@entity0 is the author of " @entity1 : @entity2 " and the just - released " traitor to his class : the @entity5 of @entity6			1
" he teaches history at the @entity8			0
historian @entity0 says power as well as race was behind controversy over @entity12			1
@entity13 , @entity14 ( @entity15 ) -- in his concession speech on tuesday night , @entity16 illustrated the historic significance of @entity20 's election by noting that a little over a century ago the inclusion of another black man , @entity12 , at a @entity24 dinner provoked outrage in large parts of the country			1
@entity16 was n't giving a history lecture , and he quickly moved on , but the tale is worth exploring , as it is both more complex and more instructive than @entity16 's brief remarks suggested			0
@entity31 was the one who initiated the acquaintance that led to his 1901 dinner with @entity36			2
@entity31 had built the @entity37 of @entity38 into a political base that made him the most powerful black leader in the country			2
invited to address the @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , in 1895 , @entity31 offered white @entity46 a racial bargain : blacks would cease agitating for immediate political and civil rights if whites would fund black educational and economic advancement			2
this " @entity65 " outraged black intellectuals like @entity53 , but it appealed to white leaders in the @entity57 and white philanthropists in the @entity58 -- and it marked @entity31 , the broker of @entity61 largesse and @entity57 cooperation , as one of the shrewdest politicians in the @entity57			2
@entity31 spotted @entity6 on the rise , and after @entity6 became vice president , @entity31 invited him to @entity37 , where he knew @entity6 , the apostle of the strenuous life , would be entranced by the rigorous physical regimen the students pursued			1
@entity6 was preparing to visit @entity37 when the assassination of @entity72 elevated him to the presidency and threw his plans into turmoil			2
@entity6 instead invited @entity31 to call at the @entity24 whenever he was in town			1
@entity31 did n't have to be asked twice			2
within weeks , he was in the capital and was invited to join the president for dinner on october 16			0
@entity6 's ascension to the presidency made him that much more interesting to @entity31			1
yet no more interesting than @entity31 was to @entity6			1
the peculiar politics of the @entity83 gave @entity31 an importance among republicans that belied the abnegations of the @entity65			0
discriminatory @entity88 laws kept most blacks from voting in the @entity57 , but they did n't prevent the @entity57 states from sending delegations to the @entity83 national conventions every four years			0
these delegations could tip the balance in a tight contest , and @entity6 -- who though president was profoundly unpopular among the @entity83 bosses -- expected the 1904 convention to be a tight contest			0
@entity6 's invitation to @entity31 to dine at the @entity24 had little to do with @entity31 's race per se , but everything to do with @entity31 's role as a political boss of @entity105 who happened to be black			1
likewise , the outrage expressed by @entity57 editors and spokesmen over @entity6 's alleged affront to the @entity57 , while couched in the language of race , was really about political power			1
" @entity115 , how do you like it ? " fulminated the @entity113			0
" @entity116 , how do you like it ? " the @entity118 frothed over the implications of the honor @entity6 had bestowed on @entity31 : " it means that the president is willing that @entity122 shall mingle freely with whites in the social circle -- that white women may receive attentions from negro men ; it means that there is no racial reason in his opinion why whites and blacks may not marry and intermarry , why the @entity133 may not mix negro blood with his blood			1
" the vehemence of the @entity57 response gave the game away			0
@entity12 had explicitly forsworn any claim to social equality , let alone the right for blacks to marry whites			0
what the @entity57 foamers , political conservatives to a man , feared was that @entity31 might help the dangerously progressive @entity6 get elected in his own right			1
when he did precisely that -- @entity6 fended off the conservatives at the 1904 convention and was returned to office overwhelmingly -- they foamed the more			0
the race question in @entity46 has often been about race , but it has equally often been about power			0
not for 40 years , since the dismantling of the @entity88 system , has the race of guests at the @entity24 prompted anything other than idle curiosity			1
but until last tuesday those african - americans among the guests were precisely that : guests -- visitors who lacked the power that occupancy of the @entity24 entails			1
symbolism is n't unimportant , and the symbolism of a black man taking the oath of the president 's office in january will certainly bring an outpouring of sentiment like that which greeted @entity20 's election			0
but behind the symbolism of race is the reality of power			0
@entity20 will wield power of an order @entity12 appreciated in @entity6 but never possessed for himself			1
a week or a month after the symbolism fades , the reality will remain			0
at that point , @entity20 's race wo n't matter nearly as much as his facility with power			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0 .			0

@entity0 : @entity6 - @entity31 @entity24 dinner was controversial
he says the the *opposition* was about power as well as about race
african - americans have often been guests at the @entity24
brands : when @entity20 moves in , it will represent a leap in terms of power
