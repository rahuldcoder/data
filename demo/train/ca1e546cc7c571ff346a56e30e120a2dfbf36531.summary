-- " the future as a @entity2 is very uncertain			2
my ultimate aim in life was never to be a pop star			2
i enjoy it with reservations , but i 'm not really , sort of , satisfied either artistically or personally with it			2
" @entity11 ' candid words in the first @entity13 documentary , 1965 's " @entity14 , " are all the more poignant because the guitarist did , in fact , part ways with the band in 1969			1
he drowned later that year			2
the @entity13 played four gigs over two days in @entity20 in september of ' 65			1
on the heels of the success of @entity24 ' " a @entity23 , " the @entity13 ' then - manager , @entity26 , asked director @entity27 to film the band			1
the result was " @entity14 , " a film that was never officially released -- until now			1
rumors of the film 's existence was the stuff of @entity13 ' fan folklore as the film reels sat untouched , gathering moss for four decades			1
at a pivotal point in their careers the @entity13 are celebrating their 50th anniversary , and " @entity14 " captures the band at that pivotal point in their careers where they were right on the cusp of superstardom			1
" ( @entity48 " had just reached no. 1 on the charts			1
lead singer @entity49 , guitarist and vocalist @entity51 , drummer @entity52 , @entity11 and bass guitarist @entity53 were famous , but had yet to become rock superstars			2
the original film was only shown in a few theaters in 1966 before being shelved , but @entity57 uncovered unused footage and teamed up with filmmakers @entity59 and @entity61 to restore and re-edit " @entity14 " as a new film			1
the dvd / @entity63 was released earlier this month			1
the @entity13 play impromptu gig @entity59 and @entity61 had been aware of the project since 1965			1
they had tried to bring it to life in the 1990s , but the technology was n't quite there yet			0
with miles of material to sift through and footage in tatters , the project was put on an indefinite hiatus until last year , when @entity59 and @entity61 stumbled upon footage of @entity13 on stage that they did n't even know existed			1
a meticulous process unfolds the painstaking restoration process was both time - and labor - intensive			0
it was n't uncommon to have to stop everything to mend the film by hand because of a splice or torn sprocket breaking in the film scanner			1
it took two days to scan one reel of film , which contained 30,000 to 40,000 frames per reel			1
with 35 cans to be scanned , they spent several months matching sources and repairing tears , scratches and chemical blotches by hand			0
after that initial frame - by - frame scanning , there was a grading process that brought the various disparate elements a little closer to being in balance , matching grain and tone			0
when all was said and done , over 90,000 individual frames were restored by hand			0
in addition , the many separate parts they were working with had to be balanced -- grain and tone had to be matched to convey the uniformity of being part of the same work			0
and that was just the picture portion of the film -- synching audio and video was a whole other beast of burden			1
" there were many issues and challenges we were dealing with , " @entity59 told @entity0 , " not the least of which was the audio			1
since it was not shot as a concert film , there were no logs or documentation			2
" @entity59 and @entity61 spent eight months on the performances alone			1
" it was a meticulous , painstaking process of looking for clues , " said @entity61			0
" an on - camera word , a gesture , the tempo , guitar chords			0
the amazing thing is -- and every fan should appreciate this -- we sometimes had three versions of a song and every version would drop in against picture and could be matched up			0
that is a testament to the lockstep nature of @entity14 and @entity53			1
and also @entity59 , particularly the spoken word sections			1
the cadence is nearly always the same			0
he breaks the line up in the same way every time ; he breathes at the same place			0
many of his gestures remain to this day			0
he still hits his knee when he sings ' @entity161 ' and slaps the air during ' satisfaction '			0
" @entity59 recalled finding the earliest existing footage of a live performance of " ( @entity48			1
" " i get chills to this day remembering what it was like to see ' satisfaction ' with sound and picture for the first time , " he said			0
" it was like finding a @entity174 in grandma 's attic			1
i had no idea how raw and visceral they were ; how incredibly tight and controlled at the same time			0
there was a punk attitude -- a direct communication			0
" a young @entity49 's swagger in the film , a then 22 - year - old @entity49 was interviewed			1
still in his formative stages as a performer -- he had n't quite perfected the moves like @entity49 -- the rock legend did exude a keen sense of self - awareness			0
" most successful entertainers have always been the most egotistical ones -- on stage , " he said			0
" they might not be as egotistical as that offstage , but all that ego is got rid of onstage			0
" when asked what sort of person he was offstage , @entity49 remarked , " about half as egotistical			0
" dispersed throughout the interviews are concert footage of entire performances of other early @entity13 hits such as " @entity161 " and " @entity203			1
" " i do n't really know what i am on stage , " @entity49 continued			0
" it 's very different because you have to treat everybody differently			2
you have to be very , very , very egotistical because that 's -- i mean , you 're acting			2
you 're doing an act for them			0
it 's not really you			2
" @entity49 also said that when the band 's first record hit the charts , he was convinced that @entity13 would " probably be around for a year or maybe a year and a half , and then it 's all going to be over			1
" rocking the @entity20 countryside the band can also be seen traveling through the @entity20 countryside in a train car ordering tea with " lots of sugar , " being mobbed by fans , hanging out backstage and tinkering with songs in shabby hotel rooms			2
@entity49 and @entity226 were in the midst of writing " @entity229 " in one scene			0
that song was n't formally recorded for another three months			0
although the band was still finding its musical footing at the time , @entity49 's disdain for the pop music of his own youth provides a glimpse into what was to become of the band			1
" popular music was n't a real thing at all , " said @entity49			0
" it was very , very romantic " with lyrics " about things that do n't really happen ... very few of them actually mean anything or have any relation to what people are doing			0
... they were just about being unhappy because your girl had left you , or being happy because you just met somebody			0
that 's all they were about about			2
the moon in june and the sky is blue , i love you			0
" @entity49 also talked about 1960s society and how the times , they were a-changin '			0
" in the last two or three years , " he said , " young people have been -- this especially applies to @entity263 -- instead of just carrying on the way their parents told them to , they 've started a big thing where they 're anti-war and they love everybody and their sexual lives have become freer			0
the kids are looking for something else , some different moral value because they know they 're gon na get all the things that were thought impossible 50 years ago			0
a whole sort of basis of society and values which were accepted could be changed , but it 's up to them to carry on those ideals that they have instead of just falling into the same old routine that their parents have fallen into			2
so it 's not until the people of 21 now reach the age of 75 -- those kids actually have to be grandfathers before the whole thing is changed			2
" in one of the most entertaining parts of the film , @entity49 and @entity226 sing the tunes of their rivals -- the @entity24 ' " @entity295 " and " @entity296			2
" @entity49 also does an impressive @entity298 impersonation			0
what they wanted to be when they grew up toward the end of the film , some of the band mates talked about their post-rock ' n roll life plans			1
@entity11 said he always wanted to be a filmmaker , @entity49 considered going back to college , and @entity52 planned to go back to his former career as a graphic designer			2
but as it turned out , the @entity13 did not fade away			1
incidentally , the film 's title is a reference to @entity52			1
" his was the personality that everyone felt was the most endearing -- and cinematic , " said @entity59			1
@entity59 also explained the differences between the 1965 and 2012 versions of " @entity14			1
" he said he tried to " give the audience a sense of what it was like to be at one of the shows when the band was just coming into their own			2
i was also trying to show the early effects of fame and notoriety -- and foreshadow the future			0
" @entity27 's 35 - minute 1965 version , on the other hand , is more of an exploration of the band mates ' differing personalities			1
@entity59 , however , retained the original title because of the film 's cult status among @entity13 fans			1
he and @entity61 distinguished this new , 67 - minute version by version by adding " @entity20 1965 " to the name ; thus the new release is formally titled " @entity14 : @entity20 1965			1
" as @entity13 celebrate the half - century mark as a band , a rare look at its members when they had n't yet hit the quarter - century mark as people really puts their resonating success in perspective			1
at one point , the interviewer asked @entity49 what the secret to his success was			0
" there is n't any secret , " he said			0
" it 's all very obvious			2
" @entity13 : never - before - seen photos			1

the first @entity13 documentary , 1965 's " @entity14 , " has been released
the film captures the band mates , all in their 20s , on the edge of super stardom
filmmaker @entity59 uncovered the earliest footage of " ( @entity48 "
@entity59 : " it was like finding a @entity174 in @entity375 's attic "
