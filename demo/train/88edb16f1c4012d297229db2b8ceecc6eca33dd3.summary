-- through the years , there have been many unforgettable and sometimes unfortunate hairstyles			2
recording artist @entity3 of @entity4 was topped by a mohawk at an event in 2005			2
( 1 ) @entity7 the style : originally sported by warriors of various native american tribes , the hairstyle was adopted by a squad of the @entity14 's bad - to - the - bone @entity13 during @entity15 , before being commandeered by punk rockers in the 1970s			1
the story : up until a few years ago , no one would have questioned the mohawk 's roots			1
however , in 2003 , an @entity22 peat harvester made a discovery that would change the hairstyle 's history forever -- a 2,300 - year - old corpse , remarkably well preserved by the unique chemistry of a peat bog , sporting a bonafide ' hawk			1
the shocker : the ancient @entity22 punker , dubbed @entity32 , had gel in his hair , which archaeologists determined was made from vegetable oil mixed with a resin from southwestern @entity38 or @entity39			0
imported hair product ? today , scientists are still working hard to determine whether @entity42 was a prehistoric punker or just an @entity45 metrosexual			0
( 2 ) @entity46 the style : if the word brings to mind images of pink cadillacs and bouffant ' dos , you 're on the right track			0
but in the same way @entity57 borrowed rock ' n ' roll from the blues and method acting from the @entity62 , the key to those 1950s locks lies in 18th - century @entity38			0
the story : the @entity64 was @entity66 's Ã¼ber - fashionable mistress , and her elaborately teased , upswept hair was imitated by high - society women throughout the country			2
while 20th - century pompadours were considerably tinier than those of its namesake 's , the modern version claims one definitive advantage : technology			1
where today 's science has yielded hair wax , putty , glue , and paste to cement them into place , pomps of yore depended on beef tallow , bear grease , and other artery - cloggers			1
the shocker : not surprisingly , slathering one 's hair with animal remains tended to attract animals ( insects and other nasties ) , which occasionally turned the original pompadour into , quite literally , a rats ' nest			1
( 3 ) @entity100 the style : speaking of rats ' nests ( and the @entity64 , for that matter ) , the beehive of the 1960s is itself a 200 - year throwback to the 1760s @entity109			0
the story : there 's more to those 18th - century bouffant styles than meets the eye			2
whereas the modern beehive is nicknamed " the @entity100 " for its uncanny resemblance to the b - 52 bomber 's distinctive nose , @entity114 and her gal pals stowed actual warships in their hair -- or at least miniature replicas of them			2
the shocker : like precursors to the @entity127 box , these 18th - century ' dos served as treasure troves , housing exotic prizes like tiny caged birds , cupid dolls , and other bulky curios			0
of course , not every hairdo was a winner			0
when millions of hungry peasants revolutionized @entity38 , the over-the - top hairstyle quickly fell out of fashion -- landing in that little basket just below the guillotine			0
( 4 ) @entity140 the style : when the @entity143 invaded @entity144 in the 17th century , they brought over a killer fashion trend killer as in , adopt it or else			0
the story : the @entity143 sported the queue , a shaved - in - front , ponytail - in - the - back haircut , and forced the @entity149 to do the same			2
the effect ? quite a lot of protest			0
the shocker : while much of @entity144 eventually submitted to the do - or - die trend , many thousands bravely chose to keep their hair -- and lose their heads			0
so what was the big deal with getting a little shave ? aside from the queue not being such a flattering cut ( even compared to , say , the mullet ) , it also happened to be against the religion of millions of long - haired @entity167 , who believe that one 's skin and hair are sacred			1
( 5 ) @entity172 the style : a fad gone bad or the most reviled haircut in history ? popularized by @entity178 and others during the glam ' ol days of the 1970s , the mullet was adopted ( and expanded voluminously upon ) in the 1980s by hard rockers and their headbanging army of fans			1
as hair metal gave way to grunge and alternative music in the early 1990s , a term was coined to describe those who still clung to the headbangers ' signature cut -- " mullet heads			2
" the story : according to the @entity195 , which inducted " mullet " into its venerable lexicon in 2001 , the word ( as it refers to a hairstyle ) was " apparently coined , and certainly popularized , by @entity57 hip - hop group the @entity199 " in their 1995 song " @entity172			1
" the shocker : since making it into the @entity195 , ridicule of the bemulleted has grown increasingly vocal and , judging from a random sampling of anti-mullet web sites , rather virulent			0
the mullet is the one haircut @entity57 love to hate -- and give funny names to			1
to list a few : the @entity211 , the @entity172 , and the @entity172			1
our personal favorite , however , is the @entity214 , which manages to reference both the haircut 's " business in the front , party in the back " policy , as well as the shameful compromise of 1820 , which regulated slavery in developing @entity57 territories			1
