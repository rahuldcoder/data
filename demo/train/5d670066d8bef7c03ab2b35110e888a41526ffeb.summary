-- a new era is beginning in the @entity2 -- or you could call it the continuation of a political dynasty			1
@entity7 has been sworn in as president , the country 's 15th , after winning election in may by a landslide			1
he secured more than 15 million votes , about 5.7 million more than his closest competitor , one - time president @entity13 , in a vote viewed as a litmus test for the country 's democracy			1
there were nine candidates in all			2
you can associate @entity7 with a familiar color -- yellow			1
he is the son of two revered figures in @entity2 life , former president @entity25 and her husband , @entity26			1
the elder @entity26 , an opposition leader , was shot dead upon return from exile in the @entity29 in 1983 , as he attempted to lead a movement to push longtime dictator @entity31 out of power			2
upon his death , the push for reform fell to his initially reluctant wife , who won support for her " @entity39 " movement while wearing her signature yellow clothing			2
amid widespread allegations of electoral fraud and a military mutiny , the @entity29 withdrew its support for @entity31 , and he sought exile in @entity45			2
@entity25 served from 1986 to 1992 , fighting against poverty and the country 's massive debt , while contending with a @entity50 insurgency and seven coup attempts			0
she managed to reform the country 's constitution , imposing a single six - year term for presidents			0
enter the younger @entity7 , who like her , sports signature yellow clothing and talks of restoring power to the people			1
he takes office after three other presidents who followed his mother , @entity64 , @entity13 and @entity65			0
at 50 , he 's a relatively youthful president			2
critics say he 's had a lackluster records as a congressman and senator			0
but supporters note there 's been no question about his integrity , in a country where corruption is rife			0
like his mother , he had to be coaxed by friends and supporters into running			0
but now , many @entity2 are noisily celebrating			1
a public holiday has been declared for the inauguration , which took place at an oceanside park in @entity83 , filled by a sea of people			0
many wore yellow and carried banners and @entity2 flags , while others constantly fanned themselves in the heat			1
the inauguration also attracted dignitaries from throughout the region			0
@entity7 vows to fight corruption , and supporters say he 'll provide a contrast to the unpopular @entity65 , who was often accused of turning a blind eye to it			1
he 'll only be able to serve for six years , under the reform introduced by his mother			0
but @entity7 already has made some waves , naming a retired @entity102 chief justice to lead a truth commission that will look for graft and possibly prosecute @entity65			1
he also promises to scrutinize the budget to make sure no funds are being lost to corruption			0
and he 's said he wants peace talks to end decades - long communist and @entity111 insurgencies			0
despite big ambitions , @entity7 , a bachelor , has a reputation for quiet modesty			1
" do n't let me start out having an inflated sense of my own worth or my ego , not having my feet planted firmly on the ground , " he said in april , " because i might succumb to the same temptations that those who are criticizing me have done			0
