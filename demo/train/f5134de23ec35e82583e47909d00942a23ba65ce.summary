-- we know it 's serious news			0
but we 'll admit : the recent arrest of 11 members of a so - called @entity7 espionage ring -- coupled with coverage of their assumed identities , their old - school tactics ( invisible ink ! ) , and even , in the case of " red - hot beauty " @entity14 , their coquettish @entity16 pictures -- got us thinking about some of our favorite stylish spies from film and television			2
here 's a list of our top 10			0
@entity23 in " @entity24 " @entity26 agent @entity25 ( code name : @entity28 ) had a love / hate relationship with her @entity31 counterpart , @entity30 , in the 1977 film			2
together , they traveled through @entity34 and battled @entity35 , a steel - toothed , 7 - foot - tall assassin			2
but when the mission ended , @entity25 -- played by @entity38 model @entity37 ( who looked almost as good in her uniform as she did in a bathing suit ) -- fell far short of her stated goal of killing @entity30 ; instead , she bedded him ( in a submarine escape pod , no less )			1
@entity0 : the 21 most iconic swimsuits ever 2			0
@entity45 in " @entity46 " @entity31 agent @entity47 had several different partners over the course of the original 1960s series , but @entity45 , played by @entity51 , was the best : a certified genius equally adept at fencing and martial arts , she fought mad scientists in mod black - and - white ensembles ( many of which were designed by @entity59 )			1
@entity60 stepped into the iconic leather catsuit for a big - screen version in 1998			2
@entity64 in " @entity65 " @entity63 was nothing short of sensational as @entity64 , a vulnerable - yet - deadly double - agent working with the @entity67 in the series that kicked off in 2001			1
more to the point , she looked sensational , masquerading as everything from club kid to hotel maid to geisha with stylish aplomb			2
@entity0 : @entity63 's transformation 4			1
@entity77 in " @entity78 " @entity76 played the titular cocktail - dress - clad assassin in @entity81 's original 1990 film : she went from teenage drug addict to literal femme fatale at the behest of her @entity85 intelligence agency handlers			1
@entity86 starred in @entity87 , the 1993 @entity89 remake , and @entity90 found fame in a late 1990s tv version			0
this fall , the character will be resurrected yet again , as @entity95 takes on the title role in the @entity98 series " @entity77			0
@entity99 , @entity100 , and @entity101 in the " @entity100 " movies			1
they came from three different eras and worked for three different agencies , but @entity99 ( @entity106 ) , @entity100 ( @entity107 ) and @entity101 ( @entity108 ) had more in common than their line of work and their improbable attraction to the snaggle - toothed spy @entity100			1
they also shared an affinity for truly over-the - top ensembles , as seen above ; we like @entity99 's futuristic silver shift best			2
@entity0 : @entity108 's transformation 6			1
agent 99 in " @entity123 " eminently capable and devastatingly gorgeous , @entity121 's agent 99 was the only control agent , aside from @entity124 , whose identity had n't been compromised at the start of the 2008 film			2
( the character was updated from the version @entity130 played in the original 1960s show			0
) the series of ever - more - fabulous couture getups she donned over the course of her and @entity124 's mission was n't exactly believable , but it sure was impressive			0
@entity138 in " @entity139 " @entity137 played @entity138 , a @entity31 treasury agent brought in to bankroll @entity30 during a game of high stakes poker in this 2006 " reboot " of the series			1
but she certainly did n't look like a boring bureaucrat : instead , the terminally conflicted @entity138 stunned in a series of dramatic evening gowns , including this sophisticated open - backed number			0
@entity0 : stars in bikinis 8			0
@entity151 in " mission : impossible " the pillow - lipped @entity85 film star @entity153 played a member of the fancifully named @entity156 in this 1996 big - screen adaptation of the classic tv show			1
@entity159 , as @entity160 , may have suspected that his fellow agent 's loyalties were divided , but given how beautiful she looked in her well - cut separates and chic little suits , we understand his inability to keep his guard up			1
@entity168 in " @entity169 " our favorite scene in 1995 's " @entity169 " comes when the formerly bored wife of secret agent @entity172 ( @entity173 ) converts her slightly frumpy high - necked , long - sleeved dress into a short , sexy cocktail mini with little more than her bare hands			1
after @entity168 ( @entity177 ) slicks her hair back with a bit of water from a vase of flowers , she 's ready for intrigue			0
@entity0 : @entity149 ' most memorable dresses 10			0
@entity186 in " @entity187 " @entity185 played a @entity67 - agent - turned - corporate - spy opposite @entity190 in this 2009 romp			1
and , of course , she had all the usual accoutrements -- dark sunglasses , black trench , etc. -- but we loved this romantic v - necked printed dress she wore while shooting in @entity198 , @entity199			0
bonus : @entity201 in " @entity201 " okay , we have n't yet seen " @entity201 , " in which @entity203 stars as a @entity67 officer accused of being a double agent , and it 's not in theaters until july 23rd			1
but if the action - packed trailer is any indication ( and , judging by the numerous shots of @entity203 looking chic on set ) , it looks to be a very stylish entry into the cannon			0
