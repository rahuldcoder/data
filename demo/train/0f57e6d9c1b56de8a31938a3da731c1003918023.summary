-- q : sgt. @entity2 has been accused of killing 16 @entity4 civilians			1
he served three tours in @entity6 before this and his lawyer says he may have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or a traumatic brain injury			1
what 's the link between violence and those disorders ? a : psychiatrists understand some types of aberrant behavior pretty well and can do things to help resolve it			1
but , unfortunately , in other instances -- and often the most interesting ones -- we can only mumble generalities that require no special expertise and that offer no hope for a diagnosis or treatment			1
take the case of @entity30 sgt. @entity2 , accused of massacring 16 @entity4 men , women and children while they slept unprotected in their village			1
the first thing a psychiatrist would want to know is whether the person who committed such a heinous act was psychotic at that time , meaning out of touch with agreed - upon human reality			1
did he perform the killings as a result of deeply held false beliefs or in response to hearing voices commanding him to act ? if yes , then although the tragedy remains , the psychiatric mystery is solved			1
but at this point , although @entity51 has reportedly told his lawyer he remembers nothing about the night of the massacre , there is no evidence he was psychotic immediately before the killing spree			1
nor do we have any evidence at this point that the killings were motivated by some larger political purpose , which might also explain , but certainly not justify , them			1
so why would someone who had appeared normal to everyone around him suddenly commit such a hideous act ? @entity30 reviewing ptsd evaluation program much has been made in the media about the fact that @entity51 was on his fourth deployment			1
moreover , he had suffered mild traumatic brain injury in @entity6			2
traumatic brain injury can cause a wide range of mental difficulties , from poor decision making and memory to increases in impulsive behavior , irritability , depression and personality change			2
so how likely is it that @entity51 ' traumatic brain injury explains the accusation that he massacred 16 @entity4 villagers ? the answer is : not very likely			2
why ? consider , as alternative possible explanation , mania			2
mania is often characterized by the sudden onset of bizarre , agitated behavior in public and it is not necessarily related to traumatic brain injury			2
traumatic brain injury almost never causes otherwise solid citizens to ruthlessly massacre men , women and children			2
thousands upon thousands of people develop severe manic episodes every year			2
thousands upon thousands of service men and women have been multiply deployed and have suffered various levels of traumatic brain injury , and yet there is only one @entity51			2
that is why it does n't fit very well			0
mass murder is just about as rare in people with brain damage as in people without brain damage			0
note that i said " just about			0
" in fact , organic brain damage can be a cause of mass violence			0
probably the most classic example of this in @entity124 history was the case of @entity126 , who went on a shooting spree from atop the @entity129 tower that resulted in the death of 16 people			0
although he was under multiple stressors at the time of the incident , he was found to have a brain tumor in the " rage area " of his brain ( i.e. the amygdala ) upon autopsy			0
in the case of @entity51 , if he is guilty of the massacre , his actions may eventually be found to be related to a clearly causative organic factor			0
but my clinical experience tells me not to bet on this			0
it happens , but pretty rarely			0
when people behave in unexpected ways for no good reason , it often turns out that when the full story of their lives is understood , the behavior no longer appears as unexpected			0
that which is neither clearly linked to either a medical or psychiatric illness is very likely intertwined in a person 's longstanding personality			1
so , i suspect that if 100 psychiatrists were told that a previously normal service person massacred 16 civilians and was neither medically impaired nor psychotic , the majority of them would immediately suspect that the person in question might not have been as normal across his life as initial reports suggested			1
in fact , as more comes out about @entity51 this appears to be the case			0
it now appears that he was involved in fraudulent business dealings			0
what makes the case so strange , however , are the multiple contrasting reports of his remarkably caring and selfless behavior on numerous occasions and his status as something of a small town hero			0
i seem to end many of my @entity183 pieces with some type of comment about how unsatisfying our current level of psychiatric understanding is			1
this pieces , alas , is no different in this regard			0
frankly , at this point nothing in @entity51 ' actions makes psychiatric sense			0
on the other hand , how many highly admired , hard - working , patriotic , caring small - town heroes are embroiled in financial fraud or may have other dark behaviors in their backgrounds ? maybe the fact that @entity51 himself may not make sense is the best place for us to start in our understanding of the horrible events in @entity4 .			1

a lawyer for sgt. @entity2 says the *soldier* may have been suffering from @entity209 , @entity210
sometimes our understanding of psychiatry is unsatisfying , *dr.* @entity212 says
@entity217 : the *backstory* to someone 's life is just as *important* as the current situation
