-- @entity2 's 25th album , " @entity3 , " continues the thread of @entity6 archaeology that he began on " @entity10 , " a self - produced 2003 set of traditional songs and covers			1
but where " @entity10 " was a first brush with history -- @entity2 trying to make it come to him -- here he meets that history on its home ground			1
a set of old - school originals recorded in resonant settings ( @entity22 in @entity23 ; the @entity24 in @entity25 ; a hotel room in @entity27 where @entity28 cut some classic sides ) , " @entity3 " shows @entity2 channeling spirits and stepping into period styles			1
producer @entity33 rides shotgun , and the duo keep it simple : an old @entity37 reel - to - reel tape recorder , a single vintage ribbon mic , a small group of empathetic players			2
they include @entity43 guitarist @entity42 ; @entity44 , whose rhythms shaped @entity46 and @entity48 ' @entity47 ; and stand - up bassist @entity49 , who played with @entity50 at the end of his life			0
@entity2 's songs show a writer still on a hot streak after 2008 's @entity33 - produced " @entity59 , " arguably the singer - songwriter 's best lp since his 80s heyday			1
he shoots for timeless here : aside from an allusion to an answering machine on the @entity65 - style " @entity66 , " these songs could have all been written 50 years ago or more			0
" @entity70 " is a gentle folk sermon with a dash of existential doubt			0
the swinging " @entity74 " considers @entity72 and the devil -- " both inside of me / all the time " -- with @entity77 's jazzy @entity76 fiddle			2
considering the title , @entity2 has made a remarkably dark record			1
" @entity87 " is about a guy out of work , ditched by his wife , mourning a father , a son and his only friend , over an old - timey hillbilly strut			0
the lead character in " a @entity89 , " a stumpy waltz , is also penniless , " sick of life " and pondering the afterlife , " if there is really one			0
" the dude in " @entity95 " insists he would kill himself " if i were n't so afraid			0
" but as usual , @entity2 is at his best when he turns hardscrabble struggle into damn - the - torpedoes rock & roll			1
on the title track , a classic @entity101 " boom - chick - boom " romp , @entity2 runs through a list of fantasies , some quite reasonable , before concluding that " it wo n't get no better than this " -- however relatively [ expletive ] - up " this " might be			1
welcome to life in 21st - century @entity6 , ladies and gentlemen : let 's party like it 's 1929			2
" @entity3 " is n't a perfectly honed set			2
but @entity2 has never sounded looser or easier on a record			1
the most indelible moments are straight - up funny			0
" @entity124 " imagines a relationship from back - seat grope through marriage , kids and subsequent disasters , before deciding it might be better to go home alone			0
and on " @entity127 , " a man and his 14 - year - old son get hassled in a cafe , slash a [ expletive ] up , get thrown in jail , then walk off with the dude 's grateful wife			2
it 's musical storytelling for hard times : far - fetched , violent , sexy , played for laughs			1
it does n't get more timeless , or @entity6 , than that			0
