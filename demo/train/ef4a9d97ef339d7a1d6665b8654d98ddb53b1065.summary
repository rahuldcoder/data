@entity0 -- four months after hushed deal - broking produced a new leadership lineup for @entity5 , @entity2 is to set to formally take charge of the country he 'll rule for the next 10 years			1
@entity2 , along with new premier @entity8 , has inherited a supercharged economy that 's created vast riches for some , a growing middle class , and many poorer migrant workers who are becoming increasingly frustrated with their lot in life			2
but the deepening wealth divide is n't the only challenge facing the country 's population of 1.3 billion people			0
in november , as @entity5 was convening its 18th @entity20 , @entity1 asked a number of @entity5 experts to define what they believe to be the country 's most pressing challenges			1
we revisit their thoughts four months on , as delegates attend the 12th @entity29 in @entity30			1
@entity31 opens @entity5 's @entity29 with call to unite 1			1
closing the wealth gap in february , the @entity5 government announced plan to raise spending on social welfare by two percentage points within the next five years			2
economist @entity39 says that 's nowhere near enough to narrow the wealth gap and argues that the country needs to work on a " much larger scale			0
" " if the government creates a stronger social safety net for its citizens , @entity5 workers will feel less pressure to save for health emergencies , unemployment and retirement , and more likely to buy goods and services -- and create a mature consumer - driven economy , " he says			2
@entity39 explains his views here			0
too many men faced with a surging population , @entity5 attempted to put the brakes on procreation in the late 1970s by implementing a controversial policy limiting couples in some areas to just one child			2
since then , a cultural bias towards male children has led to a skewed child sex ratio where millions of men , or " bare branches " face an uncertain future due to the lack of potential female partners , writes evolutionary biologist @entity72			0
" it would be difficult to overstate the urgent need for @entity5 to emulate @entity77 in eliminating sex - biased abortion and neglect , " @entity74 writes			0
studies show , he says , what can happen if it does n't			0
securing @entity5 's food , water and air the legacy of @entity5 's powerhouse of cheap , labor - intensive exports is a natural environment tainted by the pollutants of economic growth			1
author @entity92 says securing the food , water and air security of @entity5 's 1.35 billion people is one of the leadership 's biggest challenges			1
" @entity30 and other parts of northeastern @entity5 are already water - stressed , the air quality in inland mega-cities such as @entity105 and @entity106 is abysmal , farming land is being poisoned by toxic runoff from mining and industrial activities , acid rain blights large parts of south @entity5 , contagious disease is an ever - present risk among its livestock , and unscrupulous makers sell tainted foodstuffs , " @entity92 writes			1
