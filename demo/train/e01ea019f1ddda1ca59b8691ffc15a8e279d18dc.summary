@entity0 , @entity1 former virginia gov. @entity3 is vowing to keep fighting the bribery accusations that on tuesday landed him a two - year prison sentence			1
outside the federal courthouse in @entity0 , the @entity8 said he was " deeply , deeply sorry " for the actions that led to his conviction on 11 felony public corruption charges , but that he " never , ever betrayed my sacred oath of office			1
" @entity3 and his attorneys vowed to appeal the convictions immediately			2
the two years was a much shorter sentence than the 10 to 12 years that prosecutors had started the day asking for			0
but it was enough to rock @entity3 's children , family and friends , many of whom gasped as it was read and were left wiping away tears			2
when @entity3 left , his wife , @entity29 , who could face a similar sentence herself , remained in the courtroom , sobbing			2
related : @entity33 's prison advice for @entity3 his sentencing was the culmination of the dramatic downfall of the @entity8 governor once heralded as a rising star -- tapped to give the party 's 2010 rebuttal to president @entity42 's @entity41 , and a fixture on short lists for national office			1
now , @entity3 has another distinction : he 's the first @entity1 governor ever sent to prison for corruption			1
@entity3 pled on tuesday for mercy , saying he is now a " heartbroken and humbled man			1
" his attorneys spent several hours ushering in a parade of political friends , religious leaders and family members to tout the @entity8 's good character -- and reading excerpts of more than 400 letters they 'd submitted making the same case			0
it was n't enough to keep him out of prison entirely			0
@entity62 district court judge @entity61 delivered the sentence on tuesday			1
his decision : in addition to 24 months in prison , @entity3 faces two more years of supervised release , as well as $ 1,100 in fines -- $ 100 for each of the 11 felonies for which he was convicted			1
@entity3 was ordered to report to prison on feb. 9 , just before his wife 's feb. 20 sentencing			2
it 's @entity1 's former first lady whose relationship with @entity0 businessman @entity77 , who provided the bribes that led to their convictions , has faced the most intense scrutiny in recent months			0
@entity3 's defense attorneys , allies and even one of the family 's daughters pointed to @entity87 shopping trips , @entity89 vacations and more -- portraying a woman in love with the perks of power and a man too naive to say no. that assessment , @entity61 said , is " dangerously delusional			1
" " while mrs. @entity29 may have allowed the serpent into the mansion , the governor knowingly let him into his personal and business affairs , " the judge said			0
in his comments to @entity61 , @entity3 pled for leniency for his wife			1
prosecutors would n't say tuesday what penalty they 'll seek for her			0
@entity3 's attorneys had tried to keep the former governor from spending any time in prison			1
they argued instead for 6,000 hours of community service -- or about three years worth of volunteer work			1
they even offered specific ideas , like working with a religious organization to aid the poor in @entity116 or managing a food bank that serves an impoverished section of rural @entity1			0
prosecutors , meanwhile , said that would amount to sweeping his crimes under the rug			0
the @entity62 @entity123 had said federal sentencing guidelines suggested a sentence of 10 to 12 and a half years -- and prosecutors sought something in that range			2
but @entity3 's attorneys convinced @entity61 that the loans and gifts the former governor took from @entity77 were being overvalued , and @entity61 knocked the sentencing guidelines down to 6 and a half to 8 years -- and still delivered a punishment short of that			1
@entity61 , a @entity134 appointee , said he 's spent decades trying to understand why seemingly good people do bad things -- but that @entity3 's crimes were too serious to ignore			1
" this entire case has been tragic from beginning to end , " @entity61 said			0
the courtroom was so packed with @entity3 's family members , friends , political allies and former staffers that federal officials had to feed video of the proceedings onto televisions set up in another courtroom -- and that one filled up , too			0
afterward , @entity62 attorney @entity151 said getting prison time for @entity3 is a victory , and sends a warning shot to other politicians			1
@entity3 , 60 , was convicted in september of 11 felony public corruption charges			1
his wife , @entity157 , was also found guilty on eight charges			0
the charges were a result of the @entity3 family accepting about $ 177,000 in gifts and loans from @entity0 businessman @entity77			2
the trial was an emotional ordeal that often pitted @entity3 and other members of his family against his wife , who was portrayed as the driver of the family 's connections with @entity77			0
the two were convicted of taking bribes from @entity77 in exchange for government favors as he sought to market a dietary supplement			0
the gifts included shopping trips with dress purchases in @entity87 , wedding catering for the couple 's daughter , golf outings for their sons , a @entity187 watch and more -- the bills for which @entity3 's attorney , @entity189 , said the former governor never knew were footed by @entity77			2
" we believe that these things were kept from mr. @entity3 -- at least the source who paid for them , " he said			0
pointing to several of the individual trips and gifts , he argued that @entity3 should be sentenced for having taken $ 69,000 in inappropriate gifts and loans , rather than $ 177,000			2
afterward , @entity189 and fellow defense attorney @entity200 said the case has n't reached its end			0
" sometimes in a case like this , justice is a marathon , " @entity200 said			0
" we will never give up this case			0
