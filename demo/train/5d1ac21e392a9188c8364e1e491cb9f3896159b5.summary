-- earlier this year , @entity1 sat down with officials in @entity3 -- not to discuss troop deployments , suicide bombings or opium traffickers			1
he was there to talk about getting laptop computers into the hands of little girls			1
girls in @entity12 take a seat on the floor and get to work on their new laptops			1
as @entity17 insurgents continue to crack down on girls who go to school and women who dare to teach them , @entity1 was awestruck by the @entity3 government 's determination to educate all children , even if it means finding tools that allow them to intellectually grow in the privacy of their own homes			1
" for them to propose this was astounding , " said @entity1 , who works for @entity36 , a @entity34 , @entity35 , nonprofit committed to creating and distributing affordable , durable and solar - powered laptops to the world 's poorest children			1
" that hunger for knowledge , that desire to learn , is pretty profound			1
" from @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 to @entity47 , @entity48 and the small @entity50 island of @entity51 , at least 750,000 kids -- a number that will double by june , chairman @entity41 said -- are tapping away on @entity36 - produced @entity53 laptop keyboards			1
they 're exploring mathematics , composing music and art , learning new languages , designing animation , collecting data , collaborating with peers across borders and accessing learning tools ( including textbooks ) that they would never see otherwise			0
targeting current and historic conflict zones , including @entity66 , @entity67 and most recently the @entity68 , not only fulfills the group 's mission to offer equal - access education to the most isolated children , it may also promote world peace , @entity1 said			1
by putting laptops " into the hands of kids who would otherwise be indoctrinated , " he explained , " we can make the case pretty successfully that doing this is a long - term solution to root causes			1
" when the laptops , which incorporate free wireless internet connectivity and open - source programming , first rolled out in 2007 , they cost $ 205 each			1
now , they 're down to $ 180			0
the price is higher than @entity41 's original goal of $ 100 a pop , but it 's a figure he believes will keep going down as @entity36 finds ways to engineer the product with fewer components			1
the hope is that with corporate sponsorships and donations , collected through a program called @entity95 , the computers can be delivered to kids at no cost to the poorest host - country governments			1
the laptops allow students to engage in learning differently , enjoy a customized approach and hone critical thinking skills , explained @entity107 , @entity36 's vice president of learning			1
and their mere existence , he said , keeps kids coming to school			1
@entity107 spoke of a school in @entity67 that lacks electricity and traditionally had a 50 percent attendance rate			0
it is now drawing 1,000 more students than its previous full capacity , he said , and is even attracting kids -- who in turn are teaching their parents and grandparents -- on weekends			1
" @entity67 is recovering from genocide , " he said			0
this is a " real engagement of a society directing itself to a different future			0
" and the kids , no matter their previous exposure to technology , immediately gravitate to the machines			1
@entity1 , the group 's director for @entity133 , the @entity134 and @entity135 , recalled a visit to rural @entity137			0
as he passed out the laptops , he kept one eye on the children , the other on his watch			1
seven seconds was all it took for an 8 - year - old boy to flip open the never - seen - before computer , find and then hit the power button			0
within two weeks , that boy and his classmates would be programming			0
meanwhile , the nearby adults stared at the oddball objects and flashed the international look of , " what the hell is this thing ? " @entity1 said			0
" kids are technology natives , and adults are technology immigrants			2
" despite its ongoing successes , the downturn in the economy has taken a toll on the nonprofit			2
the last @entity95 promotion brought in $ 2.5 million , while the first incarnation brought in $ 37.5 million , @entity41 said			2
and corporate sponsors fell from 11 to three in the span of 30 days , he added			0
early this year , the organization laid off half of its staff , bringing the total on payroll to just 32			0
these economic realities , though disappointing , wo n't impede the mission , said @entity41 , who created @entity36 with others from the @entity174 of volunteers around the world offer technical support and training , and serve as translators and programmers			1
" if we could get all the children in the world -- 1.2 billion of them between 6 and 12 -- to have a connected laptop , that would be success , " @entity41 said			0
" roughly half of those children have no electricity at home or school			0
the poverty is so extreme , and the environmental conditions are so extreme , we have to focus on them			0
" the push has been to reach out to developing nations , but that has n't precluded the group from serving @entity200 communities that can pursue the program at a scale that makes sense financially			2
@entity205 in @entity206 , for example , now has 14,000 of the group 's laptops in students ' hands			2
@entity211 , principal of @entity212 in @entity213 , opened his building 's doors last year as the district 's pilot school for the free laptop program			0
" it 's been an overwhelming success at our school , " which has a poverty rate of 83 percent , @entity211 said			0
through professional development and a summer camp for kids , the school is learning how to best utilize the computers			2
and the students , who own their laptops , are learning about responsibility			2
they 're " totally engaged in what they 're doing , " @entity211 said			0
" i have kids getting out of cars in the morning with their laptops open			1
" one of those kids might be @entity238 , a fourth - grader who is using the computer on her own time to learn @entity241 with her mother , @entity242			1
" it gets me more interested because she 's interested			0
... she does n't put it down , " said @entity244 , who used to take her daughter to the library when she needed a computer			2
" i like it because people can learn stuff , " @entity238 , 9 , said after school			2
" you can listen to music			0
you can also learn how to make different things			2
i can learn how to use the keyboard			0
... yes ma'am , my laptop can do many things			0
