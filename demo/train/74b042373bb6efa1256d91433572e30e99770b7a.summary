-- the first officially sanctioned ivory auction in nearly a decade happened tuesday in @entity2 , with opinion split on whether the sale will help or hurt efforts to stop elephant poaching			1
the @entity2 government sold almost eight tons of ivory for $ 1.2 million , said @entity9 , the secretary - general of @entity10 , the international agreement covering the trade of endangered species			1
supporters say the auction will provide cash for elephant conservation			1
opponents say it will stimulate the demand for ivory			1
buyers came from @entity23 and @entity24 , with the @entity23 buying nearly 4.2 tons and the @entity24 buying 3.7 tons , said @entity9 , who spoke to @entity0 from the auction in the @entity2 capital of @entity27			1
the auctioned ivory consisted of whole elephant tusks and pieces of tusks in various sizes , he said			2
nearly 10 tons had been available for sale in @entity2 , and the pieces that were not sold were the worst - quality pieces that will now be kept by the government or destroyed , he said			1
the sale was the first of four approved by the secretariat of @entity10 , which stands for the convention on @entity40 and @entity41			0
first adopted in 1963 , the agreement now has 173 signatories			0
the last such ivory auction happened in 1999			1
another auction is planned for @entity46 later this week , and for @entity47 and @entity48 next week , said @entity49 , a spokesman for @entity10 in @entity50 , @entity51			0
the auctions involve all of the stocks of government - owned ivory , all deemed to be of legal origin , he said			2
that means the ivory comes not from poaching or confiscation , but from animals that died naturally or -- in the case of @entity48 -- from the period before 1994 when elephant culling was allowed , @entity49 said			2
@entity23 and @entity24 are the only approved customers for the auctions , @entity49 said			0
they were the two nations that expressed an interest in the ivory and fulfilled the conditions set by @entity10 to allow its trade			0
under the agreement , proceeds from the auctions must be used exclusively for elephant conservation and community development programs in or near elephants ' range in the four countries , said a statement from @entity10 , which is administered by the @entity81			1
in @entity2 , for example , some of the money will be spent in communities that have problems with elephants destroying crops or killing people , @entity9 said			1
" the revenues are expected to boost the countries ' capacity to conserve biodiversity , strengthen enforcement controls and contribute to the livelihoods of the rural people in southern @entity48 , " a @entity10 statement said			0
" all this without affecting negatively @entity100 and @entity101 elephant populations			0
" conservation groups , however , have expressed doubts that the auctions will do anything but encourage poaching and the illegal killing of elephants			0
the sale " will stimulate , not satisfy , the massive demand for ivory in countries like @entity23 , " @entity109 , chief executive of the @entity110 , told @entity0			1
" it will do nothing to re-educate customers ( in @entity23 and @entity24 ) that buying ivory is signing an elephant 's death warrant			1
" the four auctions taking place over the next two weeks may also encourage other countries with elephant populations to hold their own ivory sales , especially now that they have seen the proceeds tuesday 's sale generated for the @entity2 government , @entity109 said			1
the @entity129 , an independent environmental campaign group , expressed a similar fear			0
@entity129 campaigns director @entity131 told @entity0 the ivory market will fail to see the auctions as one - time sales of legal stocks and instead simply see the reemergence of ivory on the market			2
" by opening it up to a legal trade , it will just stimulate that ( ivory ) market further , " @entity131 said from the @entity129 's @entity143 office			2
the @entity146 said a legal ivory trade allows poachers to launder their stocks of illegal ivory			2
@entity109 and @entity131 said they do n't believe @entity10 ' safeguards on @entity23 and @entity24 are strong enough to prevent the illegal ivory trade			0
more than 108 tons of ivory remain to be auctioned in the next three sales , @entity10 said			0
@entity46 plans to auction 48 tons ; @entity47 plans to sell slightly more than four tons ; and @entity48 plans to sell more than 56 tons .			0
