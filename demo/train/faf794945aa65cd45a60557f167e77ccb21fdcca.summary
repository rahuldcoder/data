editor 's note : @entity2 is the associate editor of @entity3			1
his book " the persecution of @entity6 " is slated for publication by @entity8 in the spring of 2010			1
@entity6 's charisma is such that she does n't need to hold an office to wield influence , @entity2 says			1
( @entity12 ) -- " everything changed on august 29 in politics in @entity17 , " @entity6 told @entity14 's @entity13 this week			1
the reference was to the day last year when @entity19 announced that @entity6 , a 44 - year - old mother of five who became @entity17 's governor only in december 2006 , would be his presidential running mate			1
@entity19 's surprise pick altered the trajectory of the 2008 campaign -- for a few weeks , at least -- and launched @entity6 , until then an unknown political neophyte , on the path to global celebrity			1
but it also set in motion a chain of events that , a little more than 10 months later , would culminate in @entity6 's surprise announcement that she would leave her office effective july 26			1
before the day she joined the 2008 @entity36 presidential ticket , @entity17 saw @entity6 as a champion of ethics in government who had twice defeated oil interests , governed with @entity42 in a bipartisan manner and brought down powerful members of her own party			1
she enjoyed record approval ratings , and her major initiatives had all been signed into law			2
but the good times did n't last			0
by the following july , @entity6 's approval numbers had sunk to the mid- 50th percentile , the coalition on which she governed had collapsed , and most of her time was spent combating a hostile media and frivolous ethics complaints			1
what happened ? the campaign			0
the reaction to @entity6 's nomination was as visceral as it was unhinged			1
knowing almost nothing of the feisty hockey mom turned political dragon - slayer , some in the media turned rumors -- had @entity6 supported @entity67 ? had she been a member of the @entity68 ? did she believe that dinosaurs were around a couple thousand years ago ? -- into established facts			1
not content to examine @entity6 's actual record , the press did its best to transform the unconventional , pragmatic politician into a fire - breathing social conservative who was outside the @entity78 mainstream			1
@entity42 partisans committed to @entity81 's election demonized @entity6 until she became the emblem for everything liberals think is wrong with @entity78			1
comedians lampooned her accent , her looks , her religion , her education and her family			0
the same @entity19 aides who championed @entity6 for vice president later turned on her and leaked damaging ( and false ) information to a press eager for any tidbit confirming its view that the governor was unqualified and reckless			1
one lousy interview with @entity100 did n't help			0
something about @entity6 riles people up			2
after the @entity103 lost the election and the governor returned to @entity17 , the onslaught against her did not cease			0
the democrats in the state legislature who once had been @entity6 's allies turned on her			1
her opponents , continuing their never - ending search for dirt , inundated the governor 's office with 150 @entity117 requests for documents relating to @entity6 's schedule and contacts			1
the @entity121 counts 18 ethics complaints filed against @entity6			2
all of them have been dismissed , but at great cost to the state in man - hours and wasted resources			0
the @entity6 family 's personal legal liability is around half a million dollars			1
meanwhile , the father of her grandchild went on a publicity tour flacking " intimate " details about her family , and @entity135 joked on national television about @entity137 impregnating her underage daughter @entity138			0
( he later apologized , saying he intended for the joke to be about @entity6 's 18 - year - old daughter , @entity141			1
as if that would make it any more tasteful			0
) and @entity19 sources kept providing ridiculous insinuations about her to reporters ( all on background , of course )			0
@entity6 did nothing to deserve the acrimonious venom that has been flung at her non-stop since she first appeared onstage with @entity19			2
the professional , emotional and financial toll on her has been incredible			0
partisan agendas and personal animosities have left her with few friends and many opponents in @entity17			0
and so , last week , she did what she is used to doing			0
she shook up the playing field			0
on july 26 , @entity6 will be a free woman			2
no longer will she have to juggle official responsibilities , a national political following and her children			0
she can travel freely to the @entity162 without worrying about how it may affect her standing back home			0
she can defend herself and her family against slander without the controversy distracting from the duties of high office			0
she can make money to pay the bills			0
she can pick her battles without being hemmed in by the state legislature and bureaucracy			0
her charisma is such that she does not need to hold an office to command attention or wield influence			0
she resigned from the @entity179 all of a sudden in 2004 , plunged into a @entity36 gubernatorial primary in october 2005 and joined @entity19 's campaign without hesitation			2
two of these three dizzying moves ended up in victory , and one did not			2
two out of three is n't bad			0
why should n't @entity6 think another gamble might pay off ? @entity6 herself may not know her next move			2
speculation about her presidential ambitions is premature , though it will be much easier for her to build a national organization now that she has no professional ties to @entity17			1
whatever she does will be noticed , that 's for sure			2
because the attention lavished on @entity6 's decision is further evidence of her unwitting ability to bring out deep - seated feelings of admiration -- and loathing -- in people			1
we will be hearing from @entity6 , and from the palin - haters , for a long while to come .			2

@entity6 's impulsive moves have yielded positive results in the past , @entity2 says
he says speculations about her presidential ambitions are premature
" whatever she does will be noticed , " @entity2 says
