to bail out its troubled banks following an emergency meeting of @entity5 finance ministers			0
the agreement followed nine hours of talks in @entity8 that concluded early tuesday			0
it was aimed at preventing @entity1 , the eurozone 's fourth largest economy , from needing a full bailout itself			1
in june , @entity15 finance ministers agreed to set aside $ 150 billion to shore up the capital base of @entity1 's banks			1
@entity18 was also given an extra year to meet its steep budget deficit target , according to @entity20 , @entity21 's prime minister and the head of the @entity5 finance ministers group			1
@entity1 had been told to cut the difference between its income and spending to within 5.3 % of gross domestic product ( gdp ) by the end of 2012			0
but it will now be given until 2014 instead of 2013 to cut its deficit to below 3 % of gdp			0
@entity1 given extra time to cut deficit " we are aiming at reaching a formal agreement in the second half of july , taking into account national parliamentary procedure , allowing for a first disbursement of 30 billion euros by the end of the month to be mobilized as a contingency in case of urgent needs in the @entity1 banking system , " @entity20 said in a statement to reporters after the meeting			1
the ministers from the 17 - nation bloc met 10 days after their heads of government agreed to use its temporary bailout funds to recapitalize @entity1 's ailing financial system and to set up a joint supervisory body for the area 's lenders			2
under the terms of the deal , this supervisory body will oversee the eurozone 's banks and use the single currency area 's rescue funds , the @entity56 or @entity57 , to aid banks directly without adding to governments ' debt			2
however , the first cash injection will be filtered through @entity18 's existing bailout fund			0
audits commissioned by the @entity1 government recently showed its banking sector -- beset by bad debt in the aftermath of the country 's property market crash -- is likely to need 60 billion to 70 billion euros in extra cash to stay solvent			1
meanwhile , @entity1 and @entity80 borrowing costs continued to rise to unsustainable levels monday , with @entity1 's 10 - year bond topping the critical 7 % level			2
