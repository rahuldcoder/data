-- are the world 's top male players playing too much tennis ? it is a question that has been asked frequently over the years , but recent comments from world number three @entity7 , and former world number one @entity9 , have indicated the matter could be coming to a head			1
with a schedule that runs from the beginning of january to the end of november , taking in 65 singles tournaments , the @entity12 @entity12 came under scrutiny like never before when @entity7 hinted that the world 's top players were prepared to take strike action in an attempt to modify the calendar			1
" we 're only proposing small changes , a few less mandatory events and some more rest periods , " said @entity7			1
" @entity27 is in a great place right now but there are just a few minor things we 'd like to see changed and we hope to sit with the @entity12 and other officials and discuss them			1
two or three more weeks off a season is really what we are thinking of			0
" and @entity7 's comments were backed up by @entity9 , who told reporters : " it 's a more physical game than it used to be , but the season is longer than ever			1
" i do n't think we 're storming offices , but i think the sentiment is still there			0
we need to be smart about it and take our time and make sure that it 's well thought out and not be kind of reactionary			0
but , you know , there is a discussion going on			0
" the absence of @entity49 and @entity50 from the recent @entity51 indicates , in @entity9 's opinion , that the demands are too harsh on the top players			1
" they do n't get their money this week			2
if they were feeling well and they were n't worn down , then they would be here , " he continued			0
" we 're not getting away with anything by pulling out of tournaments			2
i feel like that 's the way it 's presented sometimes			0
that 's just not the case , " he added			0
the lowdown yet , despite the claims of both @entity7 and @entity9 , the facts show that the number of singles tournaments has actually fallen over the last 11 years			1
in year 2000 there were 69 @entity12 singles events , however , that figure steadily decreased during the last decade and since 2007 it has remained static on its current number			1
and , for those 65 events , there has been a significant increase in the prize money on offer from the @entity12 , with prize funds set to exceed $ 90 million for the first time by 2014			1
so why are is there a perception that players are playing more tournaments , than ever before ? somebody who knows all about the rigors of the @entity12 is @entity91 @entity90			1
the 46 - year - old won a remarkable 67 doubles titles , many alongside compatriot @entity94 , with the duo completing the grand slam of all four major doubles titles			2
in addition to this , @entity90 also managed to win four singles titles , reaching a career - high 19th in the world in 1996 , and has first hand knowledge of how demanding the circuit can be			1
" when i was playing and performing well in both singles and doubles , the calendar issue was raised even then , " @entity90 told @entity0			1
" what with @entity112 ties , the @entity109 etc , you never felt like there was any time to take a breather , it was full on			0
" the weeks off were cherished			0
as an aspiring player , you play to gain experience -- and since you may not survive through to the end of a tournament , the toll is not as great on you physically or mentally			0
losing first and second round matches can be replaced by simply entering another event to compensate , " added @entity90			2
" yet as a top player , you end up playing many more matches , the pressures are greater , you try to strike a healthy balance to prepare for excellence at the grand slams and it 's a continual mounting of pressures			0
" the reaction @entity90 also believes it a positive thing that today 's players are campaigning together , although he does not necessarily believe reducing the calendar is the way forward			1
" there is a fear that by shortening the calendar to accommodate players requests of resting at the end of each season -- their agents will slot exhibition matches in their place , which will be worth more financially to the player ( and their agent ! ) , " @entity90 added			1
" perhaps there should a total blackout of all exhibition matches for a period of say four weeks -- and if the players are in need of some competition , they can go back and play some club tennis			2
" another former player , and now commentator , @entity162 also believes the schedule is fine as it is			2
in his column in @entity167 newspaper @entity164 , @entity162 said : " players are obliged to play eight mandatory masters 1000 tournaments , four 500 @entity12 events and the four majors , plus the @entity173 if they qualify			1
" with pre-grand slam events thrown in , we are looking at a commitment of 30 - 34 weeks of the year			2
i am looking at it and thinking there is n't a lot to moan about			0
" the players are under a lot of strain and the tour takes its toll -- but if your body is telling you something , listen to it and withdraw from the odd tournament			0
" the future since his initial comments , @entity7 has seemingly backtracked on any talk of strike action , telling reporters : " when i said a strike was a possibility , i did n't expect that to be such a massive issue			2
" it 's so far away from being at that level			0
none of the players want to strike and i think we are maybe coming across as being a bit spoiled when i do n't think that is the case			2
" the @entity12 politely turned down @entity0 's request for an interview regarding a proposed players ' meeting , although @entity12 spokesman @entity211 said : " the players should and do have a major say in how the game is run , which is one of the key reasons the @entity12 was formed as an equal partnership between players and tournaments			1
" we have regular discussions with the players , including very recently , and are always receptive to their input			0
it 's important to let them have time to discuss and focus on which topics are most important to them and then we can work together on next steps and solutions			0
" sporting strikes are not a new phenomena			0
in the last year alone there have been disputes in both @entity236 and @entity238 basketball in the @entity239 , as well as the top soccer leagues in @entity241 and @entity242 , which have resulted in a cessation of play			0
whether such extreme measures will eventually happen in tennis would appear unlikely at this stage , but what is clear is that some high - profile players are unhappy with their work - load and unless administrators , players and sponsors alike are all singing from the same hymn sheet , the current rumbles of discontent could become louder and louder in the weeks and months ahead .			1
