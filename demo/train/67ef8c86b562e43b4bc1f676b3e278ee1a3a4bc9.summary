-- there are few olympians who can say they redefined their sport , but that is what former @entity6 gymnast @entity5 did at the 1972 and 1976 @entity8			1
she won balance beam , floor exercises and team competition gold as well as silver in the uneven bars at the @entity14 , and then team competition gold and balance beam silver four years later in @entity17			1
but she will be forever remembered for her " @entity18 " -- a move so original and so groundbreaking that gymnastics would never be the same again			1
the maneuver involved standing upright on the upper uneven bar mid-routine and executing a backflip , catching the upper bar from underneath it -- a move that has since been made illegal in accordance with the @entity28 gymnastics @entity29			1
when she first performed the flip , at the age of 17 during a stunning routine at @entity14 , she was only awarded a score of 9.8 , causing the onlooking crowd to go wild , jeering and booing at the judges for several minutes			2
" i always wanted to try something different , we tried a lot of things , " @entity5 told @entity0 at @entity37 's @entity36			1
" when you 're doing something things just happen -- like going back from the high bar to the low bar			2
that 's how it worked			2
" " after me , no one else did it			2
it had a risky element -- i had brought to gymnastics new gymnastics , new elements , not acrobatics			2
it is a mistake when it is said i brought acrobatics to the event			0
" game - changing many of the moves which are now integral to modern gymnastics can be credited to @entity5 's influence			1
@entity64 , much emphasis had been placed on poise and elegance , while older and more experienced gymnasts made up the majority of the competition			0
now the sport is more dynamic with its participants primarily comprising youngsters that are on the cusp of adulthood , like @entity76 of the @entity77 -- the 4 foot 11 inch 16 - year - old , who has won two gold medals in @entity37 at her first games			1
" if you see my routine from 1972 there 's a lot of choreography , a lot of grace , and just a couple of new elements , " said the 57 - year - old @entity5 , who acquired the nickname " @entity83 from @entity84 " after her first @entity28 appearance			1
" i was inspired by no one			0
it was the 1960s , we did n't have tv -- i was just born into gymnastics			2
" human to hero : @entity28 gymnastics ' first perfect 10 following a post-gymnastics career as a teacher and divorce after a 23 - year marriage to a @entity109 folk singer , @entity5 now lives in the @entity77 , which explains her calm , confident @entity111			1
her @entity14 routine might have been performed 40 years ago but the preparation she underwent to come so close to perfection is still ingrained in her memory			0
" i did n't have a specific preparation			0
i just did it over and over again , " @entity5 recalled			1
" you would just concentrate on what you 've been doing for decades , and then show in just a moment what you 've prepared for years and years			0
" and of course , you still enjoy it			0
when you touch the equipment ... that 's it -- you 're in			2
" an inspiration if much credit is given to @entity5 's complex moves on the beam and bars for revolutionizing the sport , she also helped inspire a whole new generation of gymnasts			1
" when i became famous for my gymnastics , it brought a lot of people to the gym , a lot of people having to pay money , " she said			0
" they were very talented , but money stopped the talented people attending gym			0
unfortunately that was where it ended			0
usually poor people have more of a hunger to work , i 've seen it in life			0
" @entity154 has estimated that the annual cost of an under - 18 training program to be an @entity28 - level gymnast is $ 15,000 , which requires gymnasts to either have parents with very deep pockets or be willing to make huge financial sacrifices			1
how @entity76 charted her own destiny but , if gymnasts can transcend those financial cost , there are other great rewards to be had			0
" you know what ? " says @entity5 , " to be in the @entity8 is good , but to truly compete is great			1
it takes courage and hard work to compete			0
everybody is a winner , i could n't pick a best			0
everyone who competes is great			0
