@entity0 -- the @entity3 government moved friday to resolve a crisis that erupted earlier in the day when the country 's top four military officers left their jobs en masse in the latest power play between the government and the @entity3 military			1
late at night , the government turned to the only top commander who has not quit his position , naming former @entity17 commander general @entity16 acting chief of general staff and land force commander			1
according to people familiar with @entity3 's procedures , he needs to serve at least for a day as a force commander before he can be appointed to the top military position of chief of general staff			1
the announcement came hours after chief of staff gen. @entity27 tendered his retirement letter to the prime minister , the country 's state - run @entity24 reported			1
land forces commander gen. @entity31 , @entity33 commander adm. @entity32 and air forces commander gen. @entity34 , all asked for their retirement			2
their departures came in the face of disagreements by the military with the government over the fate of officers jailed for allegedly plotting to overthrow the ruling @entity43			2
and they come at a key time -- three days before monday 's planned meeting of @entity3 's @entity47 , which will decide what happens to the officers , state - run media reported friday			1
the government wants active - duty officers who are defendants in the case to retire			2
the military says the officers , some of whom are up for promotions , have not been proven guilty and therefore should not be forced to leave			2
@entity27 had met earlier friday with president @entity60 and prime minister @entity61 , who won his third term in office last june in a landslide victory , a show of political power that has energized his base of support			0
about 200 soldiers , including senior ones , both retired and active - duty , are defendants in an ongoing court case about an alleged coup plan dubbed " @entity77 " said to have been cooked up eight years ago at a meeting of military officers			1
" it 's unprecedented to have the chief of staff and three force commanders resigning en masse , " said @entity78 , director and senior associate of the @entity80			1
" it 's an expression of displeasure with the civilian government and , frankly , leaves in disarray the promotion process that was about to begin , " he said			2
" this is their clearest possible response to prime minister @entity61			0
" he said it comes at an important time , with the @entity3 military fighting the @entity96 in the southeast , and predicted the moves will create massive complications among the land forces			0
@entity78 said the military establishment , according to its traditions , puts forth its own promotion recommendations , with the participation of the prime minister and the defense minister			0
once they reach an agreement , the list is sent to the president for approval			0
but there have been tensions between the country 's military , which has supported the secular system over the years , and @entity61 's party , which has @entity121 roots			2
accusations by @entity61 's government that military and secular figures were involved in coup plots have intensified hostilities			1
the government wants to prevent these officers from getting promoted and holding key positions in the military while the military does not want them to be forced to retire			1
@entity133 , director of the @entity3 research program at the @entity135 and a visiting professor at @entity137 , wrote in an article for @entity1 's @entity139 on friday that the military " is snapping under the weight of the ruling @entity43 , " known as the @entity43			2
" historically the most - respected institution in the country and the kingmaker in @entity145 , the military has seen its prestige and power free - fall since the @entity43 took power in 2002 , " @entity133 wrote			0
" coup allegations , including assertions that the military was planning to bomb @entity0 's historic mosques to precipitate a political crisis , have hurt the @entity3 army 's standing			1
the military 's status as the most trusted institution in the country is plummeting : in 2002 , around 90 percent of the @entity3 said they trusted their military , while now most polls show that barely 60 percent say they do			0
" he mentions another court case , known as @entity163 , which also accuses the military of involvement in a coup plot : " for the first time in its life , the @entity3 military is like a deer in headlights , facing the political high beams of the @entity163 case			1
" " and now the military has snapped			0
the straw that broke the camel 's back came earlier this week , when pro-akp media suggested that 14 active - duty generals and admirals who had been arrested in relationship to the @entity163 case , though not yet indicted , would not only be bypassed in their promotions , but also forced to resign			0
furthermore , only yesterday , the police arrested 22 additional top brass officers , blocking their likely promotion			1
" he said the " officer corps is demoralized , " with generals and hundreds of other officers jailed with no indictments in sight			0
" this is the @entity3 military leadership 's way of telling the government : ' we are done playing with you			0
set up your own team -- if you can , " he said			0
@entity200 reported from @entity201 .			0

new : the only top commander who did not quit is promoted
the chief of the general staff and three top commanders are leaving
there 's a dispute over the *future* of officers in jail for a coup plot
this comes ahead of a @entity47 meeting
