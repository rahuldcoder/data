-- an @entity3 webpage quoted an agent calling @entity6 's drug cartels more violent than @entity7 -- a comment sure to grab attention , but which does n't tell the whole story , the agency said			1
on its website , the @entity3 was highlighting a special series of stories on law enforcement challenges along the @entity16 border			0
the report includes a quote from an unidentified senior agent based in @entity20 , @entity21 , who says , " we think @entity7 is bad , but they 've got nothing on the cartels			1
" the controversial - sounding comment was just one of point of view that exists on the ground , the @entity3 said , explaining the remark			2
" the quote is the opinion of one @entity3 agent who lives and works on border violence every day , " said special agent @entity32 , an @entity3 spokesman in @entity33			2
" the @entity3 does not believe the cartels are any more dangerous than @entity7			1
" according to the @entity3 report , " some areas on the @entity6 side of the border are so violent they are reminiscent of the gangster era of @entity43 in the 1930s or the heyday of the @entity46 's @entity45 in @entity47			1
" it cites the violent and ruthless tactics of the cartels , using as an example the case of a man known as @entity55 -- the stew maker -- who is said to have dissolved hundreds of murder victims in acid			0
@entity6 has seen other violent acts that are reminscent of @entity7 tactics , including the severing of heads and videotaping of kidnap victims			1
but according to one analyst , comparing one to the other is apples and oranges			0
" obviously , it 's a more complex issue than that , " said @entity71 , vice president of intelligence at @entity73 , a global intelligence company			0
" @entity78 here , what they might be trying to say is that clearly the scope of the drug cartels from a geographic perspective is very robust , " he said			2
the cartels are very brutal and violent , but they have n't hijacked planes , built complex improvised explosive devices or attacked @entity87 vessels , as @entity7 has , @entity71 said			0
the major drug trafficking cartels in @entity6 do use terror , however , in their rivalries for smuggling routes to the @entity87 market			0
in one recent sign of escalation , a device that authorities called a car bomb exploded in @entity98 , @entity6 , killing four			0
however , @entity71 said , it was n't clear whether it was a case of explosives packed into a car , or a carefully rigged car bomb in the true sense of the word , the type of fine deliniation that separates groups like @entity7 and @entity6 drug cartels .			1
