@entity0 -- @entity2 told @entity1 on thursday that she is still " done " with the idea of another presidential bid , but adds " you know , you never do say never			1
" " at this point in time , that 's where we are mentally is done , " @entity7 said on @entity1 's " @entity8 " on thursday morning , when asked about the possibility of her husband @entity7 seeking a third presidential bid			1
and she said her husband is " absolutely " in the same mindset			0
that interview came after she said her family was , " done			1
done " with her husband 's presidential ambitions in an interview with the @entity26 published monday			2
but @entity7 said thursday on @entity1 that " we never say never " and that the country would be in a better place if her husband were president , calling him " one competent guy who really is a great leader			0
" @entity2 on @entity31 : no ' at this moment ' the drain of the 2012 campaign has n't faded from the @entity7 family and @entity2 recalled that the family vowed to be done with @entity7 's presidential ambitions after his loss to president @entity38 in 2012			1
" at election night , we all looked at each other ... and we said we gave it everything we had , " @entity7 said			0
" we did n't have an ounce left to give			2
" " emotionally and mentally , that 's where we still are , " she said			0
but @entity7 again refused to completely shut the door on 2016 when asked if she could say confidently that her husband would not make a 2016 bid			1
@entity7 grew emotional when she described her husband 's accomplishments and experience managing " turnaround situations " -- from rescuing the 2002 @entity53 to his tenure as @entity56 governor to his corporate experience			2
" i think the times call for someone of that capability , " she said			0
@entity7 even suggested that " what 's happening in @entity66 " would n't be the same if her husband were president and recognized that would make a great case for a 2016 bid			1
and @entity7 's entire family agrees on that point , his wife said			0
" my kids are like , ' @entity72 , it 's just such a shame you 're not there , ' " @entity2 said			2
@entity7 's open letter : i love @entity2 @entity7 was on @entity1 's @entity8 discussing the launch of the @entity79 , a research center that will look to find treatments and cures for diseases like multiple @entity84 , which @entity2 was diagnosed with , as well as @entity85 and @entity86 , among others			1
that interview came after @entity7 first said her family was , " done			0
done " with her husband 's presidential ambitions , but then told the @entity91 the next day that " we 'll have to see what happens			0
" will @entity7 take the plunge again ? and on 2016 , @entity2 seems to be taking the cues from her husband as she told the @entity91 tuesday that " we 'll have to see what happens			1
" that comment nearly identically echoed how her husband has explained that while he does n't envision a 2016 run , there 's always a chance			1
" we 'll see what happens , " he told @entity104 last month			0
and in an interview with radio host @entity108 , the two - time presidential contender said " circumstances can change , but i 'm just not going to let my head go there			0

@entity2 said her family -- *including* her husband -- does n't want a repeat of the emotionally draining 2012 campaign .
but she also left the door open , saying " you know , you never say never " .
the @entity8 interview comes just days after she said she was , " done . done . done " with the idea of a 2016 bid .
