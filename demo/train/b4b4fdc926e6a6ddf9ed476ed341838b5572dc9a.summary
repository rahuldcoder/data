-- @entity1 and @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 -- this year has witnessed the evolution of some classic rivalries that bode for an intriguing 2013 sporting calendar			1
will they become the new @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 or @entity14 -- or will an apparent tendency towards friendliness dampen the sparks that are so vital in a true clash of competitive egos ? the relationship between @entity21 and his heir apparent as golf 's biggest star is already showing signs of an unexpected " bromance "			1
" i think it 's sort of evolved since @entity31 at the start of this year , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity27 when the duo sat down for a joint interview			1
" i 'd played with him before but never really got a chance to speak to him in depth			2
i think we both have a lot in common -- we 're both big sports fans and i think our relationship has evolved from there because we 've played together quite a lot this year			1
" it 's been great for me to get to know him and maybe try and pick up a few things and learn from him too			2
" @entity1 wins @entity46 before the rise of @entity1 , golf 's undisputed no. 1 player this year , @entity21 ' previous big rival was @entity50 -- and their relationship was notoriously frosty			1
they snapped at each other via the media , and @entity21 ' former caddy @entity56 ramped up the tension with some choice remarks to the press and and fans from which even his employer had to hastily distance himself			2
friendly enemies but @entity21 , now 36 , seems much happier in competition with @entity1 despite the 23 - year - old being poised to usurp him as @entity66 's biggest golf endorsement			1
" we 've battled each other a few times , but we have a lot in common , " @entity21 said			2
" granted , there 's an age difference but i had a huge age difference with my other good friend @entity74 , but we had so much in common			2
" i think our relationship will certainly grow over the years , but so too will our competitiveness -- i do n't think that 's going to change			2
" @entity78 reigns in @entity79 however , while @entity21 is good friends with @entity74 , a man almost 20 years his senior , they were never really on - course rivals despite the older @entity85 's two major triumphs in 1998 -- a year of highs that he never repeated			2
but if @entity21 and @entity1 are to become truly great adversaries along the lines of @entity11 - @entity89 and @entity91 - @entity90 then they ca n't afford to become too cosy , according to sports leadership expert @entity92			1
" at the extreme , the ability to defeat your opponent , to crush them , requires huge mental discipline , " said @entity92 , whose book " @entity95 " features the @entity99 - dominating @entity98 / @entity97 era and the @entity101 - winning team captained by @entity104 golf icon @entity102			1
" as soon as you begin empathizing with your competitor , you may not have that killer instinct , " @entity92 told @entity0			1
" great sporting rivalries bring out the best in both players			2
great sporting friendships is a great tactic for one and not the other			2
" if @entity1 becomes a genuine rival as opposed to the rival of the moment , then i think @entity2 will find it hard not to compete in every dimension possible			1
" it 's in his dna , it 's what makes him a great competitor			2
in many respects the best thing about it would be if they did become real rivals , if there was a sense of abrasion or friction -- a sense that sparks fly			2
it would do wonders for the sport			0
" woods , @entity1 ' too tired ' for $ 7 ` m @entity145 tournament as @entity11 once said of @entity11 : " we are adversarial friends or friendly enemies			1
all our lives we 've competed against each other			0
@entity150 and i fight like the devil about stuff			0
" tennis stars @entity4 and @entity3 have been friends since childhood , but they have still maintained a ferocious on - court rivalry that this year has reached towards the heights of predecessors such as @entity13 , @entity12 and @entity160			1
@entity161 at first struggled when @entity162 ended his complete domination of the men 's game , but the duo now publicly insist they are firm friends following years of epic clashes -- despite an apparent spat this year over the @entity171 's desire for changes to be made on the @entity173			0
" great shared experiences build great bonds between people , " @entity92 says			0
" that bond is different than friendship			1
it 's a bond of respect			0
" bitter feud for @entity21 and @entity1 there is every incentive to cast themselves as friends and rivals			1
already they have been lured into playing a lucrative exhibition clash in one of golf 's key markets , @entity145 , that led them to withdraw from a premier @entity195 event in the same country later that week			1
" they both just got huge paydays in @entity145 , they may be putting a slight front on that camaraderie , " sports psychologist @entity197 told @entity0			1
" in a sport like golf , having a spat with a rival is n't seen as being the right thing , whereas ( in soccer ) @entity208 having a spat with ( rival manager ) @entity212 , that seems to be quite normal			1
" @entity197 argues some of @entity1 's older @entity104 peers such as @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 -- who have won only one major title between them -- may have suffered from their on - tour friendship			1
" speaking with a lot of golf coaches , that generation have been perhaps a bit too friendly with each other , " said @entity197			1
" if you compare them with @entity226 , he was renowned for keeping himself quite isolated , which was a catalyst for his competitiveness			0
i think keeping your distance from competitors can be a useful thing			1
" @entity226 has questioned the apparent friendship of golf 's two biggest names , but @entity1 played down the criticism			1
" you 're on tour long enough and you do n't need enemies out there , you want to have friends , " the @entity238 told @entity0			1
" life on tour can get a bit lonely at times and you wan na have guys that you can go out for dinner with			0
you 're seeing most of the guys each week and you 've got to have someone to talk to			1
if that 's what worked for @entity226 then great , but i do n't think it would work for me			0
" @entity98 drops @entity5 appeal plan in the high - octane world of @entity99 , @entity6 is known for his clashes with fellow drivers -- he left @entity259 after only one season following a bitter feud with teammate @entity262			1
however , this year the @entity171 has been much more respectful of @entity5 , despite @entity98 's united front in downplaying the achievements of @entity266 's history - making triple world champion			0
recalibrating sport rumors persist that the @entity270 marque wants to sign @entity5 for the 2014 season , which would be an acid test for relations between the two drivers			0
" when you get two no. 1 drivers together with no team rules , then the sparks can really fly , " says @entity92 , who has worked with @entity98 and former @entity99 world champion @entity274			0
" it 's rare for them to be good mates			0
they may get along , they may trust and respect each other in a professional capacity , but hanging out is a different issue			0
" seven - time world champion @entity97 , who has now retired for a second time , was known for his win - at - all costs approach at @entity98 but such an attitude is becoming increasingly unacceptable for sports fans , says @entity92			2
contrast the feelgood factor of the @entity292 with the demonization of @entity294 , who has refused to contest allegations of systematic doping during his time as cycling 's tour de force			0
" there is , at the moment , a very fine line that sport is treading -- this desire and ambition to win , but not to do so at all costs , " says @entity92			0
" someone like @entity97 , his desire to win would take him to the dark side			0
that type of willingness to do whatever it takes is a feature of champions			0
unmoderated , it 's pretty dangerous for the game			0
" we 've just been through a period of excess and egregious behavior from many corporates -- but equally sporting teams as well			0
the desire to win , and the merits and rewards of winning , maybe outweighed the joy of winning			0
" i think sport is recalibrating			0
that 's why the @entity330 made everyone so happy			0
there was a sense that winning was important , but not necessarily at all costs -- it 's the sportsmanship sometimes that makes the bigger story			0
