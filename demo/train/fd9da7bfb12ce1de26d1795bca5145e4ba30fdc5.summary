-- @entity1 received the loudest , longest applause at the start of her first taping as a judge on @entity7 's " @entity6 " on thursday , but it was fellow newcomer @entity9 who appeared ready to steal the spotlight during the second season of the popular talent search show			1
during the first of two days of tapings in @entity15 , @entity16 , the panel of four judges -- spears , @entity9 , producer @entity20 and series creator @entity21 -- listened to 31 singers and groups audition for a chance at a $ 5 million recording contract , with the four music industry vets critiquing the performances and deciding who should advance to the next round in @entity30			1
@entity19 ' addition to the show -- along with @entity9 , she was announced as a new judge at television upfront meetings with advertisers earlier this month , with a rumored $ 15 million contract -- has drawn plenty of speculation about how the pop star would mesh with the other judges			2
wearing a tight , fluorescent salmon pink dress , @entity1 was the last judge introduced to the 4,000 - plus crowd at the @entity44			2
she received sustained cheers as she sat down to the right of @entity21 , the departed creator of @entity7 's " @entity47 " ( and normally the biggest star at the judges ' table )			2
when her turn came to critique singers , @entity1 remained encouraging and positive , giving the most " yes " votes of any of the judges and keeping her comments short and declarative instead of engaging with contestants			2
of a teenage male performer she offered , " you could be bigger than the next @entity62 , " and in complimenting a moving , soulful female singer on her confidence she said , " you were flawless			0
" when a performance demanded critical remarks from @entity1 , she replied with a simple " pass , " or " i think you need someone to teach you to sing better			0
" after a sub-par song from a rapper who bore more than a passing resemblance to her ex-husband , @entity70 , @entity1 said only , " i like your hat			0
" while @entity21 talked to @entity1 off microphone between many of the performances and asked her to lead off critiques several times in an apparent attempt to draw her into exchanges , the 19 - year - old @entity9 needed no such prodding			1
playfully flirting with male contestants ( " she is single now " became a common refrain from @entity21 ) and giving insightful comments at every chance , the teen star drew laughs and cheers from the crowd , along with several stunned , open - mouth stares from @entity21 as the two verbally sparred			1
it was those times when the interaction between the contestants and the judges produced the types of moments that show executives hope will increase ratings following the ouster of first - year judges @entity99 , @entity100 and former " idol " judge @entity101			0
take the moment when @entity21 , 52 , admitted to taking a liking to a charismatic 22 year - old contestant , who returned his affection			0
" it 's too bad we did n't meet 10 years from now , " @entity21 said with a wink before @entity9 drily countered , " more like 30 years			1
" startled and momentarily silenced , @entity21 responded , " @entity9 , you 're going into the naughty chair			1
" it was the first of at least three such utterances on the day that @entity21 lobbed at @entity113 , suggesting viewers and audiences can expect many more charged jabs between the two this season			0
