-- if the attorney general of @entity3 had had his way , @entity1 would have been executed thursday for allegedly hiring someone to kill her husband , @entity6 @entity1 , who has suffered a lifetime of abuse -- first at the hands of her stepfather and later at the hands of her husband -- also struggles with mental illness			1
on the night of june 4 , 1999 , when her husband was killed , @entity6 was in the hospital			1
at her trial , jurors bought the prosecution 's version of the crime and found her guilty of murder for hire			1
defense attorneys did not call the alleged killer to testify on her behalf , nor did the defense present the son 's multiple confessions			1
judge @entity30 imposed a death sentence			2
now , evidence is coming to light revealing that it was the son , @entity34 -- aka @entity35 -- who killed his father and that @entity30 knew of the son 's confession before the trial , but on a technicality , the jury was n't permitted to see his jailhouse confession letters			1
no wonder , with such exculpatory information withheld , @entity1 was found guilty and received a death sentence			1
as is often the case in these harrowing tales of justice , only now , 14 years after the trial , have dedicated post-conviction lawyers ' investigations shed light on the son 's confessions			1
in letters to his mother , @entity35 wrote in stark detail how he killed his father and why			0
he also confessed to forensic psychologist @entity57 in the course of a pretrial interview			2
those confessions are corroborated by the fact that it was @entity35 who led police to the murder weapon and that it was his hands that tested positive for traces of gunpowder			2
in one of his admissions to his mother , @entity35 wrote : " i sit in my room , for a good 1 Â½ - 2 hours and dad comes in my room and goes off on me , calling me bastard , nogood , mistake , and telling me i 'm inconciderate ( sic ) and just care about my self , and slaps me , then goes back to his room			0
as i sat on my bed , tears of rage flowing , remembering my childhood , my anger kept building and building , and i went to my car , got the 9mm , and walked to his room , peeked in , and he was asleep			0
i walked about two steps in the door , and screamed , and shut my eyes , when i heard him move , i started firing			0
when i opened my eyes again , i freaked ! i grabbed what casings i saw , and threw them into the bushes , grabbed the gun , and went to town			0
" @entity35 's letters were barred at the trial			2
@entity30 precluded the jury from hearing them as a sanction against @entity6 's lawyers , who failed to share them with the prosecution in a timely manner			1
what the jury did hear was the prosecutor 's scenario that @entity35 was part of a murder - for - hire conspiracy , with his mother as mastermind and his friend @entity114 as the shooter			1
in a deal with prosecutors for a reduced sentence , @entity35 testified against his mother			0
what @entity35 said to a sheriff when he was interrogated can not be verified			0
county authorities say the recording was lost			0
but in a letter , @entity35 said : " i gave them ( the sheriffs ) one bulls * * t story after another , trying to save my own ass			0
... i was so scared , confused , and high , i just started spitting the first thought out , which turned into this big conspiracy thing , for money , which was all bs , that 's why i had so many different stories			2
" as evidence now shows , @entity30 also knew of @entity35 's confession of guilt to psychologist @entity57 even before the trial			2
driven by conscience , @entity57 had told the judge what @entity35 had voluntarily revealed to him , but the judge did not disclose this to the jury and went so far as to instruct @entity57 not to share the information with the defense			0
when the defense took the unusual step of asking the judge , instead of the jury , to pass sentence , judge @entity30 chose death			0
this week the @entity154 denied the state attorney general 's motion to set thursday as an execution date for ms. @entity1			1
the big question now is whether the @entity154 will grant @entity6 's request for a hearing to consider the newly revealed evidence , including @entity57 's affidavit stating that he told the trial judge about @entity35 's confession			1
i 'm holding my breath			0
i know all too well what happens in such successor petitions in some higher courts			0
in my book " the @entity171 , " i tell of two men in @entity173 and @entity174 denied hearings on new evidence of innocence because the higher court held their petitions to be " procedurally barred " or because @entity181 supreme courts , almost as a matter of course , uphold prosecutors ' positions on death cases			1
those two men were executed , and i accompanied them to their deaths			0
i hope and pray that @entity6 , a victim of both physical and constitutional abuses , fares better			1
