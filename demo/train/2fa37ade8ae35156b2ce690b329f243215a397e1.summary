-- ten people suffered minor injuries monday when the nose gear of a @entity7 jetliner collapsed after landing at @entity9 's @entity8 , the city 's @entity1 reported			1
@entity10 345 was landing at @entity8 from @entity11 about 5:40 p.m. when the accident occurred			1
the nose of the blue - and - orange jet came to rest on the ground after the aircraft came to a stop , and passengers evacuated the aircraft on emergency slides			1
" the aircraft skidded down the runway on its nose and then veered off and came to rest in a grass area between the runway and taxiway foxtrot , " @entity21 , the airport 's general manager , told reporters			2
it stopped about halfway down the 7,000 - foot runway			0
@entity32 , a passenger aboard the @entity33 , said a " strong jolt " could be felt inside the cabin when the gear failed and the nose slammed into the tarmac			1
" it was just a bang and a bounce , and then a slam on the brakes and a skidding feeling , " @entity32 told @entity0 's " @entity44 360			1
" " i feel extremely blessed to have come off that , " she said			0
" it just really felt like the plane could have broken in half , it was such a hard impact			0
" fellow passenger @entity49 said the situation was " pretty chaotic			2
" " we hit the ground pretty hard and slid , " she said			0
" there was a lot of smoke filling the plane , just a lot of smoke and burnt rubber			0
" another passenger said it felt like the plane crashed and then skidded to a stop			2
" everything in the plane that was loose went flying forward , " @entity63 said			0
" there were cell phones , @entity67 , books ( and ) drinks all skidded up			0
" a total of 150 people were aboard the flight			2

there were conflicting reports about how many members of the aircraft 's crew were among the injured			0
@entity7 said three flight attendants had reported being hurt , while @entity21 said the six - member crew had been taken to a hospital for observation			0
@entity8 was closed to arriving flights as emergency vehicles surrounded the disabled jet , but the airport was back open for arrivals and departures by 7 p.m. , @entity21 said			1
initially , the @entity93 said the crew reported a possible nose gear problem before landing , but later amended that to say that after it reviewed air controller tapes , no issues were noted ahead of time			1

the incident followed a runway crash of an @entity109 jetliner in @entity110 last month that killed three people and injured more than 180 others			2
investigators in that crash will not determine a cause for several months at least but initial attention has focused on actions of the crew during approach			0
the @entity33 has a conventional hydraulic landing gear system -- a unit under each wing and a steerable wheel that extends from under the nose			1
pilots can land safely with only the main gear operable and such incidents occur from time to time			1
@entity7 has more than 600 of the 737s in its fleet , including those operated by its subsidiary @entity131			0
in may : plane lands without landing gear at @entity135 @entity0 's @entity136 contributed to this report .			1
