-- you know , it 's not like older fathers do n't have enough to deal with			1
we have to keep that smile on our faces when the school 's reading adviser mistakes us for our son 's grandfather			1
we have to pretend not to notice how much more hair all the other dads have , how much younger their wives are and how much more well - equipped they are to coach the soccer team			1
that 's because when they were kids , they actually played soccer , while we grew up with more ' 60s - like pursuits , such as baseball , stickball and smoking dope			1
we have to listen to people saying we 're too old to keep up with our own kids , and we have to deal with the fact that they 're absolutely correct			1
but on top of all that , every two years or so , we have to deal with another study saying that we 're much more likely to produce children who have @entity32 's syndrome , attention deficit disorder , bipolar disorder and every other mental illness this side of mogo on the go go			1
( and we have to deal with the fact that all of the fathers of our kids ' friends are way too young to catch @entity44 references such as " mogo on the gogo			1
" ) study : children of older dads at higher risk of psychiatric disorders a report published this week in @entity53 confirmed this trend			1
it is a huge study of data about 2.6 million @entity58 - born children and reveals that a guy like me , who became a father at 45 ( i was 46 , actually ) , would be three or four times more likely to have a child with autism spectrum disorder			2
when @entity65 was born , they told me that because of my age , he was much more likely to have autism than , say , the child of a guy who had n't had his first prostate exam yet			2
they ran me through all the other things that could go wrong , which gave me great pause			0
it 's terrible , of course , to think that we older fathers are putting our children 's health at risk			1
until you think about the alternative -- not having them at all			0
then it gets tricky , does n't it @entity65 has so far managed to survive my dotage and reach the sixth grade			2
i 'm writing quickly because i like to be done with work at 3:30 , when he gets home from school , so we can play a little catch or pingpong or even kick around a soccer ball before he starts on his homework			0
the thought that i might have listened to the scolds who chastised me for daring to think about having a child in my advanced years -- the thought that this boy might not have come into my life -- is utterly beyond my comprehension			0
i shudder to even think of @entity65 never having been born -- and because i am a neurotic old jew , i have to spit on the ground three times for even having written the words , like @entity107 will do whatever terrible things to us that we think or say , but then we spit three times he says , " oh , well , that 's much better then			2
" where did we come up with this stuff ? as it turns out , @entity65 does suffer from some anxiety disorder issues			0
did he inherit them from me ? were they caused by my creaky old decrepit sperm , as the studies suggest , or the cultural heritage that had him born to a father so neurotic that he made his son wear a football helmet to go on the swings ? or is it just one of those things ? i have no idea			2
but i do know this : he is lucky to have me for a dad			1
he is lucky not despite my age but because of it			2
because i am old enough to be done with the workplace striving that used to keep me in the office until way past what would have been his bedtime , had he existed then			0
because i 'm content to work from home , for a much lower salary , so that i can be here to have that catch			0
to play that game of pingpong			0
and to counsel him and console him and help him come up with strategies when the anxiety gets to be too great			0
and yes , because i have worked all my life and am financially secure enough to get him the help that he needs -- to have him in a school that has responded incredibly well to his disorder			0
to find the best therapist in the world			0
and most importantly , he is lucky because i am old enough to give my son what i could never have given him when i was younger : patience			1
older dads are more patient , i think , because we know we will probably never go through all this again			1
we know that these precious moments -- the bottles that gave way to sippy cups , the swings that gave way to skateboards , the @entity170 that gave way to @entity171 -- these moments are golden gifts from @entity107 , and we understand that in a way that we never could have , in our salad days			0
and so we cherish them , and we savor them , and we believe that spending that time down on the floor when they are little , and in the backyard while they are growing , and at the table talking when they need us to be at the table talking , makes all the difference in the world			0
all the difference in their world , and in our own			0
hey @entity53 -- go study that for a change			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			1

@entity192 : new study says kids from older dads more likely to have mental *difficulties*
@entity192 's an older dad and has his ***challenges*** , such as being mistaken for son 's grandfather
despite the risks and ***challenges*** , @entity192 says he could n't imagine not having his son
@entity192 : older dads benefit kids with mental ***challenges*** ; they are lucky to have each other
