-- in the age of @entity3 and e-books , common wisdom claims that brick - and - mortar bookstores are going the way of the dinosaurs			0
if a national chain such as @entity10 , which folded in 2011 , could n't succeed in this climate , what are the odds of an independent shop going the distance ? surprisingly good , it turns out			0
i 've published three novels over the past three years , and each time i head out on tour , i discover amazing bookstores			0
while it 's hard to beat the internet for sheer efficiency , virtual book - buying ca n't satisfy the same itch for discovery that browsing in person can			1
moreover , it 's become easy to love e-books and local stores since @entity31 started partnering with independents to make some 3 million titles available electronically			1
the stores that are succeeding offer a mix of author visits , staff recommendations and community outreach that 's impossible to replace			1
while there are incredible indies all over @entity42 , these are my favorites : @entity43 : @entity44 , @entity45 they say everything is bigger in the @entity45 , and @entity43 seems determined to make that point			1
this three - story shop has sat on a prime plot of downtown @entity44 real estate since 1970 , and its marquee sign out front lists that day 's special guests , which have included former presidents , rock stars and best - selling novelists			1
what makes @entity43 special is that it 's just as welcoming to newly minted authors , too			1
while every department is fully stocked , crime novels get a lot of love here , especially since the 2012 launch of @entity67 , a store within the original store			1
@entity69 as the store is , it 's still a place where handwritten notes from staff line the shelves , personally recommending favorite reads			1
6 incredible artist studio tours the @entity77 : @entity78 , @entity79 while its name suggests a criminal enterprise , @entity80 specializes in fiction -- not only mysteries , but historical novels , literary fiction and works set in the @entity87			0
still , crime fiction is close to its dark little heart -- beating since 1989 -- and this is a place that stocks its shelves with @entity93 and @entity94 titles that are often impossible to find elsewhere			0
the store 's owners are so passionate about books that they founded the @entity98 in 1997 , and it 's since become one of the largest hardcover publishers of @entity102 - language mysteries in the world			1
i think of it as the little press that could			0
@entity107 : @entity108 if i could give an award for the most beautiful bookstore in @entity42 , this one in @entity108 's @entity111 would win			1
with its soaring ceiling , elegant chandeliers , slender columns and leather wing chairs , @entity112 looks like an idyllic private club for book lovers			0
some dedicated bookworms have even tied the knot in the store			1
beautiful as it is , the shop 's biggest strength is its charming staff , who are adept at sussing out any visitor 's interests and recommending what to read next			1
seductive as their home base is , they also sponsor readings and events around the city			2
mysterious @entity135 : @entity136 , @entity137 the first time i encountered the staff of this shop was n't at the store itself , but at a noir at the bar reading in @entity146 -- a popular crime fiction reading series that takes place in cities across the country			1
home base is a shiny new space that only opened in 2011 ( the original @entity155 store has been operating since 1993 ) , but @entity156 is hardwired into the local community , hosting author events at schools , its popular @entity160 at independently owned restaurants , and organizing the @entity163 conference for romance readers			1
subterranean books : @entity166 when @entity168 opened in 2000 , it carried a mix of new and secondhand books ; since then , it 's shifted its focus to carrying only new books			2
but they do n't try to stock everything			0
instead , they 've carved out a niche with cult - classic novels , intriguing offerings from small presses , and books about film , pop culture and history			0
everything in the store has been personally selected by staff members , so their recommendations are deeply personal			2
the @entity188 : @entity189 technically , there are three branches of the @entity188 , and each one is spectacular in its own right			0
the downtown store near @entity195 , which boasts 20,000 square feet of retail space , is where the @entity197 reads when he comes to town , and there 's the gorgeous @entity202 outpost in the suburbs			1
my personal favorite is the location on @entity207 , which remade the historic @entity208 into a bibliophile 's paradise with cozy corners and couches			2
@entity213 : @entity214 it looks like an elegant , old - fashioned bookstore , with its tightly packed rows of bookshelves , overstuffed international newsstand and a @entity220 © that serves rose water and cappuccino			2
but underneath that elegant surface beats the heart of an innovator			0
that was clear when @entity213 introduced its @entity228 , which takes mere minutes to print library - quality paperbacks from a catalog of almost 4 million titles			1
( that same machine also allows authors who wish to self - publish in print easy access to a press			2
) @entity236 : @entity237 this shop has two locations , but the tiny one in the @entity241 is the one that grabbed my heart			0
i discovered it while attending a conference , and i was instantly charmed by its towering shelves , spectacular travel section and inspiring view of the water			0
two years later , i returned on tour and found the same staff i 'd met the first time still working in the store			2
" we never want to leave , " one told me			0
@entity257 : @entity258 in a city where fewer than 5 % of the population is @entity102 , what hope could there be for a store specializing in english - language books ? @entity257 , whose name translates as @entity267 , has been going strong since 1984 in its small space near @entity269			2
that 's partly because its owner , @entity271 , is an extraordinary organizer who co-founded the @entity273 literary festival , which has drawn superstar writers such as @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277 to town			2
@entity279 : @entity280 this is the one store on my list that i have n't visited -- yet			0
but i 'll be in @entity280 for a conference in august , and @entity279 is at the top of my sightseeing list			0
one reason why is that the store was co-founded by @entity289 , the author of " @entity290 " and one of my favorite novelists			0
i love the fact that she opened this store at the end of 2011 when independent bookstores appeared to be in steep decline			0
( @entity289 decided to open the store after @entity280 lost its last local bookshop , saying she had " no interest in living in a city without a bookstore			1
" ) where do you like to find your next book , whether it 's a local bookstore , the library or the @entity309 ? please share in the comments below .			1

an @entity44 , @entity45 , bookstore features a mystery store within the larger store
a @entity136 , @entity137 , store hosts mystery and lunch events beyond its borders
you can print out paperbacks or your own work on a @entity323 's @entity228
some dedicated bookworms have even tied the knot at @entity107 in @entity108
