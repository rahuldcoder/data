-- he was antisocial and difficult to work with at first			1
he 'd clearly been abused by his father as evidenced by the deep , round scab near his shoulder			1
he had n't been eating well			1
and he was so skittish that the slightest noise or motion set him off			1
but @entity8 veteran @entity7 needed a new dog , and this pound puppy -- a border collie - @entity12 shepherd mix -- was it			1
he named him @entity14 , and it was n't long before @entity7 , 44 , realized they had the same issues			1
" we were kind of kindred spirits , " he said			2
" i think it really helped deepen our connection because he was n't just helping me ; i was helping him			2
i was helping him get past the same obstacles that i had			2
i had to recognize it in myself and get past that to help him			2
" @entity7 is a former tank commander and flight engineer who is n't at liberty to speak about his time in @entity31 other than to say he manned a machine gun while hanging out of the door of a helicopter			1
he can also say that he was often " exposed to very dangerous situations " during his 14 years in the service			1
he has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety from post-traumatic stress disorder , and he 's not alone			1
according to the @entity40 , 11 % to 20 % of @entity31 and @entity42 war veterans are suffering from ptsd			1
@entity7 said his depression turned him into a hermit			2
he would " curl up and not talk to anybody , " and his anxiety made it difficult to go into public			1
if he did leave the house , he was hypervigilant			2
if someone walked up behind him or dropped something that emitted a clatter , it triggered the " fight or flight " mechanism he 'd groomed in the military			2
the anxiety was so bad that before he was diagnosed with @entity43 , he went to the emergency room four times because he thought he was having a heart attack			1
he " self - medicated " so heavily with booze that it strained the relationship between him and his now - wife of two years			2
" i was having to drink to numb all my senses and be quasi-normal , " he said			2
but today , with @entity14 by his side , @entity7 is finding it easier to cope			1
the two have been working with @entity69 , a nonprofit in @entity70 , @entity71 , that helps veterans train their own service dogs			1
it is run by @entity75 , a veteran and one of the top 10 @entity77 of 2012			2
veterans in @entity79 : celebrating , honoring veterans when veterans train " their own service dog , there are immediate benefits right off the bat , " @entity75 said			1
" they have a mission and a purpose again			2
it gives them something to focus on and to complete			2
it gives them a sense of security and safety			2
... they know they 're not alone			2
they 've always got their buddy at the end of the leash			2
" now @entity7 tells @entity14 , " watch my back , " and his four - legged friend stands behind him and gives him a nudge if anyone approaches			2
when something stokes @entity7 's anxiety , @entity14 senses it , jumps up and puts his paws on @entity7 's chest so he can redirect his focus			1
" knowing he 's there makes me comfortable , " @entity7 said			2
" i 'm not worried about the attacks			0
i still think about them , but i 'm not hampered by them			0
i can go to the movies			0
" a study on hold the @entity40 recently put a study on hold that would determine the effectiveness of canine therapy for troops suffering from @entity43			1
until that study is complete , the @entity40 will continue providing dogs for a variety of ailments , but not @entity43			1
sen. @entity127 , @entity128 , co-sponsored the 2009 legislation that kicked off the study			0
he was inspired by the strides that dogs helped his mother make from 1995 to 1998 after she was stricken with @entity133 's			1
" she was n't very fond of dogs at all , but when she developed @entity133 's , they became a key part of her therapy , " the senator said			1
" she was unable to really communicate at that time , but you could easily tell , emotionally , the calming effect the service dogs had			1
" dogs : a medicine for mental health problems ? @entity127 said the @entity40 is rewriting the parameters of the study to take into account the dogs ' temperaments and the importance of matching the trainers , not just the dogs , with the patients			1
yet not everyone is convinced " the @entity40 has the right stuff " to conduct the necessary experiments , said @entity156 , ceo of @entity157 and president of the @entity160 chapter of the umbrella organization , @entity159			0
@entity156 said he hopes the study will be large enough to consider the broad gamut of symptoms associated with @entity43 , as well as the anecdotal evidence suggesting canine companions can help tug the disorder 's sufferers from their shells			1
" there 's something mystical and magical about dogs and people and placing them together , " said @entity156 , who has " worked with and against the @entity40 " during his 22 years of experience with assistance dogs			1
@entity157 has more than 900 puppy raisers and works to pair veterans with dogs regardless of whether the @entity40 shells out for it			1
@entity156 does n't cite scientific studies , such as the one that says canine interaction increases a human 's level of oxytocin , a hormone that reduces anxiety and blood pressure			1
instead , he speaks about how dogs love unconditionally and do n't judge			1
he explains how they naturally spark social interaction -- " @entity196 dog ; can i pet her ? " -- and how ownership precludes people from locking themselves in their homes , away from society			0
" you can also use them as an excuse to get out of things or leave early , " @entity156 said			0
case in point @entity208 is one pooch accustomed to being used for such occasions			0
the 2 - year - old @entity211 mix is the inseparable pal of @entity213 , a seven - year @entity8 veteran who had been housebound for about five years before meeting @entity208 in the summer			0
" he 's a very active dog			0
it makes me do things			0
i do n't have the option of hiding in the house			0
i have to go out , " said the 41 - year - old @entity219 , @entity71 , resident			1
share your story , honor a veteran during @entity224 , where she served for about nine months between 1991 and 1992 , she was sexually assaulted on multiple occasions by other service members , she said			1
it 's a fairly common occurrence that befalls about one in four women in the military , according to the @entity40			0
it left her feeling alone in the world			0
she forgot how to deal with people and eventually became a recluse , considering it a " good month " if she got out just once to shop for groceries			0
she did n't attend any of her large family 's gatherings			0
too many people and too much noise , she said			0
" for years after that , i would go out and wander the streets late at night , just hoping someone would kill me because i was n't brave enough to kill myself , " she said			0
about five months ago , her therapist recommended that she meet @entity75			0
@entity75 recalls @entity213 would n't look her in the eye when they met			0
her leg bounced when she spoke , and she pressed her fingernails into her arm			0
her boyfriend was constantly by her side			0
" you could just tell the pain and the anguish that even meeting me for the first time was causing , " said @entity75 , an @entity8 veteran herself			0
who 's your @entity77 ? vote now @entity69 teaches participants to train their own dogs , to customize their behavior			1
first , the dogs learn to sit , then heel -- the basic stuff			1
@entity208 now knows how to pick things up for @entity213 so she does n't put stress on her bad back and hips			1
he acts as a barrier , physically putting himself between her and any new people she meets			0
when she wakes up feeling gloomy , he lets her stay in bed and pet him until she 's ready to face the day			0
if she hears a sound during the night , he stays by her side as she checks it out , and @entity208 is quick to snap her out of nightmares			0
" he 'll breathe on me or lay his head across mine to wake me up , " she said of her 55 - pound companion			0
" if i 'm in a bad mood , he 'll come over and insist i play with his toy or lay his lead in my lap or lick my feet -- cheer me up			0
" @entity75 said the difference between the @entity213 of five months ago and the @entity288 of today is like " night and day			0
she 's been to the aquarium			0
she 's gone horseback riding			0
she goes places without her boyfriend			0
" she 's creating her own new normal , " @entity75 said			0
added @entity213 : " i 'm much better now			0
" @entity296 girls take brave first step young caregivers put life on hold what really sways teens not to drink , drive ? @entity303 living in fear ' under the tent ' finding musical ' diamonds ' in the slums of @entity308 @entity0 's @entity309 contributed to this report .			1
