-- the latest constitutional amendment being floated by some @entity2 republicans -- to deny citizenship to children born in the @entity5 to unauthorized immigrants -- is not new			1
calls for modification of the 14th @entity10 's birthright citizenship guarantee have appeared during other moments of immigration - related hand - wringing			1
the question is whether the idea is a good one			0
and the reform is not unthinkable from a democratic point of view			0
in fact , the @entity5 and @entity17 stand apart from other major immigrant - receiving societies in the breadth of birthright rules			2
the @entity22 amended its laws in 1981 to provide that only children born to citizens , or permanent residents born in the @entity22 , are citizens at birth			0
in 2004 , voters in @entity29 amended their constitution along similar lines , in part for reasons familiar to the @entity5 audience : fear that birthright citizenship attracted asylum claimants who could use their children as anchors			1
the @entity40 rule allows children born to foreign parents to become citizens at the age of majority ( when the state no longer considers a person a minor ) , rather than at birth			0
but if ever there were a case for maintaining @entity5 exceptionalism , the 14th @entity10 is it			1
rejection of universal birthright citizenship would upend practices vital to the success of the @entity5 venture			1
the proposed amendment 's implicit premise , that children of parents who have broken the law do not deserve @entity5 citizenship , contradicts a basic @entity5 value : the sins of the parents should not be visited upon the children			1
justice @entity66 put it succinctly in dissent from the @entity70 decision ( 1944 ) , which found @entity72 internment policies during @entity73 constitutional : " if any fundamental assumption underlies our system , it is that guilt is personal and not inheritable			0
" justice @entity78 reasoned similarly in @entity79 ( 1982 ) when striking down a @entity81 law that would have denied unauthorized children access to public schools			0
frustration with illegal immigration , he wrote , ought not lead to unequal treatment of children who had no hand in creating their " illegality			1
" @entity5 courts and most legal scholars have consistently interpreted the @entity91 to apply universally , save to the children of diplomats , invading armies and native americans ( though the @entity95 has never directly addressed the status of children born to unauthorized immigrants )			1
the clause thus operates as a constitutional reset button			0
each generation born in the @entity5 stands on its own , with equal citizenship status , regardless of parentage			1
given our history as a society of immigrants , this rule has been crucial to our development into a cohesive political community and to our ability to integrate each new immigrant cohort			1
it ensures that those who are born and raised in the @entity5 have an equal opportunity to participate and contribute and are regarded by others as full @entity5			1
not all children born in the @entity5 remain , and perhaps those @entity2 @entity119 envision deporting all unauthorized immigrants and their children			2
but clear - eyed pragmatism tells us that most children born here also go to school , become socialized and enter adulthood here , making them functionally @entity5			2
unless we are prepared to tolerate the emergence of castes based on parentage , universal birthright citizenship and a robust naturalization regime should remain in place			0
the goals of the proposed amendment are not strictly punitive , though its effects inevitably would be			0
its supporters argue it would reduce incentives for illegal immigration			1
but this argument is not serious			0
the obstacles to passage are nearly insurmountable , and this particular amendment has never come close to succeeding			0
more important , changing the birthright rule would have little to no effect on illegal immigration			1
no doubt stories exist of @entity150 crossing the border just to give birth or of tourists arranging vacations to produce @entity5 - citizen children			2
but the actual causes of illegal immigration are complex and overwhelmingly related to the absence of job opportunities in @entity150 and the demand for immigrant labor in the @entity163 because illegal immigration is difficult to prevent , lawmakers substitute symbolic posturing for genuine policymaking			1
though the 14th @entity10 is likely safe , it is instructive whenever politicians propose manipulating it to remember its historical role			2
the reset principle can also inform debates over other issues , such as the @entity174 , which would legalize high school graduates who were brought to the @entity5 illegally as children			2
even the debate over whether to legalize existing unauthorized immigrants , which is more complex because of their culpability , would benefit from an appreciation of how second chances can advance equality and integration			0
the conventional interpretation of the 14th @entity10 reminds us that we take our aspirations to equality seriously			0
we are willing to risk certain costs , such as opportunistic immigration and the creation of citizens who may never develop ties to the @entity5 , to ensure political equality			2
for the @entity5 to stand alone on this principle does nothing less than reaffirm traditions that have helped turned a collection of people from all over the world into an integrated and powerful success			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			0

@entity10 guarantees @entity5 citizenship to anyone born on @entity5 soil
@entity203 says that 's been crucial for cohesive , *casteless* @entity5 society
she argues modifying @entity212 would not reverse tide of illegal immigration
