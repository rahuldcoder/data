-- football 's new @entity2 rules have got some of the world 's biggest clubs worried			1
facing the prospect of being punished with heavy fines and barred from @entity10 competition , they are desperate to make sure that generated revenues are equal or greater than expenditure			0
@entity13 was one of the first to address balance sheet deficits when it allowed its first shirt sponsorship in 111 years , agreeing a $ 185 million deal with the @entity18 in late 2010			0
more recently @entity10 champion @entity19 , bankrolled since 2004 by @entity22 billionaire @entity21 , signed a deal with energy giant @entity24			0
one @entity26 team has even gone down the surreal route of building a hydroelectric plant in a bid to raise revenue			1
@entity31 , owned by @entity33 oil tycoon @entity32 , is selling a $ 67 million stake in the club to @entity37 investors			2
former @entity33 prime minister @entity38 , who owns @entity39 , is reportedly seeking investment from his friend at the @entity42 , @entity43 , also via @entity24			0
are footballers on a par with bankers ? the decision to seek foreign funds is alien to @entity33 football , where only one club in @entity51 has an overseas owner , and illustrates how the need to seek global sponsorship is being used to work around the new @entity56 framework			2
@entity59 's @entity58 - owned @entity57 signed a $ 628 million deal with the emirate 's airline @entity61 that was described as an " improper transaction " by a @entity64			2
welcome to the crazy world of beating @entity2			0
" clubs are looking for more revenue - generating partnerships with sponsors in part to ensure compliance with the @entity2 regulations , " football finance expert @entity66 of @entity68 firm @entity67 told @entity0			1
" the concern for many clubs if they breach the @entity2 requirements is whether they will be sanctioned through expulsion from @entity56 competition			1
" some sanctions for breaching the regulations may not be as harsh , but in order to fill a potential revenue shortfall clubs are looking for ways to beef up their accounts			2
" will football clubs play fair financially ? perhaps the most intriguing tale is that of @entity26 club @entity90 , which has created a novel way of ensuring it does not fall foul of the @entity2 rules			1
based in the @entity99 region of the country , which is fast becoming @entity26 's economic center , the six - time league winner -- whose chairman @entity96 is a civil engineer -- is investing in its future			2
the @entity104 club will build a hydroelectric plant in a bid to raise revenues after receiving permission from the @entity26 government , which is seeking an alternative source of energy after becoming reliant on the natural gas supplied by neighboring @entity22 , @entity113 and @entity114			1
the plant is expected to cost an estimated $ 50 million , with annual revenues expected to pull in $ 10 million a year			1
the deal could prove a masterstroke as @entity26 's energy market is growing by 8 % each year			2
@entity90 , which will play in the second tier @entity121 this season , is also considering plans for a second and smaller plant			2
" the club needs a guaranteed source of income , and we have the ideal conditions for hydro power , " the @entity125 quoted a @entity127 club official as saying			0
the world 's best - paid sports teams the hydro project is just the latest in a line of schemes devised by clubs to work around the @entity2 which may come under scrutiny from @entity10 football 's ruling body			1
" many of the more recent deals like @entity61 's long - term agreement with @entity57 and @entity19 's arrangements with @entity24 have prompted some to suggest such sponsorship deals are a convenient way to use the facade of a sponsorship deal to boost revenues , " @entity66 said " such analysis will ultimately be done through @entity56 's @entity152			0
they will have to assess whether such transactions fall under the ' related party transaction ' provisions of the @entity2 regulations and if so , what the fair value of the transaction really is			0
" similarly , @entity56 will also have to consider at the appropriate time whether @entity90 's innovative plan to build an energy power plant to boost club revenues would actually fall within what would be classed as relevant revenues for @entity2 calculations			1
" such investigations will only occur come the 2013 - 14 season when clubs have to submit their accounts for @entity2 compliance for the first time			1
" in a @entity56 report published last year , it was estimated that about 50 % of top @entity10 clubs were losing money and 20 % were recording sizable deficits			1
under the new rules , owners can only contribute a maximum of $ 55.5 million for the 2013 - 14 and 2015 seasons together , and $ 37 million during the period covering 2015 - 16 , 2016 - 17 and 2017 - 18			1
current rules state that should clubs incur losses in excess of $ 60 million over a three - year period , they will be hit with sanctions as well as exclusion from the @entity191 and @entity121			1
bumper revenues for @entity194 clubs tempered by soaring wages but while the boardrooms are anxiously preparing for @entity2 , supporters across the globe may not see much change			0
although spending within the august transfer window is down from $ 761 million last season to around $ 392 million so far this year , @entity194 supporters will still enjoy a first - class brand			1
" people are talking about @entity2 more in the @entity208 than elsewhere , " @entity204 , director at @entity206 's sports business group , told @entity0			0
" but i do n't think the normal fan in the stands will really notice anything too different			0
" there wo n't be any radical changes and all it will do is bring a better balance over time			0
at the very top end of the game we 've seen that football is quite resistant to economic downturn			0
" players are still going to be rewarded well and this idea of @entity2 is not a new thing			0
" @entity204 predicts clubs will adapt to the new framework and that none of the major players will fail to meet the @entity2 criteria			0
" i 'd be pretty surprised if some clubs across @entity56 were n't preparing for the @entity2 rules to come into place because this concept was approved back in 2009 , " he said			1
" @entity56 has already said it will impose sanctions on clubs which do n't comply and that could be a financial penalty or even exclusion from a competition			0
