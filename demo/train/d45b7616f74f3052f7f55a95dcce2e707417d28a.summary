-- ten years ago , as the first bombs began to fall on @entity3 , i was almost 500 miles away with our live satellite transmission dish on the roof of the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9			1
two weeks earlier the @entity10 had forced me out of the country , but before they did i managed to get to their spiritual capital @entity13 , and to our make - shift office in a dusty , drab one - storey villa			1
that visit was now proving vital			2
my cameraman , @entity18 and i set up our staff there -- two @entity22 brothers -- with a camera and satellite phone			2
their job was to be @entity0 's eyes and ears once we were forced out of the country			2
at that time , no other tv network had a presence in @entity13			2
so as the @entity32 began its response to the 9/11 attacks on october 7 , our staff were able to relay details of the bombs falling around the airport			1
later we would learn the target was the @entity40 training camps where @entity42 's fighters had infamously been recorded swinging on monkey bars and crawling through mock tunnels			2
that night it was enough to know the @entity32 had gone to war			1
special : @entity47 everyone knew it was going to happen , we even had a good idea when , but those two brothers kept me fed with an up - to - the - minute , blow - by - blow account , all those miles away on the roof of the @entity7			2
that information was then quickly passed to our audience			2
although they dared not call in their reports live , they bravely continued day after day , week after week , venturing out with a camera to record what they could of the opening days of the war			2
and sometimes braving local anger when occasionally civilians were killed			2
when a @entity10 armored personnel carrier was hit by a missile right outside our office , blowing out the windows , the two brothers were forced to flee , setting up camp in a tumbledown old house that two wars earlier had been their family home , graceful and opulent with rose gardens			1
they built a bunker among the flowers in the back garden , and kept us informed as best they could			2
when several months later the @entity10 capitulated and @entity13 , their last hold - out , fell , the brothers took us to the airport			1
the showed us dozens of @entity85 passports found in the @entity40 camp			2
many had arrived just days before 9/11			2
@entity42 knew what would follow and had rallied his supporters to his side			2
@entity10 key to peace process 10 years on driving him from @entity3 proved easy			1
killing him , however , was a decade - long challenge			2
ensuring the country does not fall into his allies ' clutches and become once again a breeding ground for terrorism is proving far more difficult			0
the @entity10 , once @entity40 's erstwhile ally , regrouped and re-emerged			1
their @entity104 nationalist agenda that claims to push the interests of @entity3 's largest ethnic group , has , on the face of it , little in common with @entity40 's global terrorism			1
the two groups share conservative @entity112 values , but while the @entity104 tribes who make up the @entity10 traditionally follow a more spiritual path of @entity116 , @entity40 's takes the ultra-radical @entity118 agenda			1
in theory , they are not natural bedfellows			0
but against a backdrop of a common enemy , the @entity32 -- considered occupiers by the @entity10 and the sworn global enemies for @entity40 -- the two are drawn together			1
that 's the conundrum : to separate and isolate @entity40 from internal @entity22 issues , thus denying them legitimacy in the @entity22 conflict			0
the @entity10 ride the great @entity132 myth that no occupier has ever successfully conquered their country			1
on the back of this , they refuse to give ground , whatever the pain			0
@entity40 money fuels the fight , and nothing in the past 10 years of war has divided the two			0
the @entity10 win local recruits every time @entity144 inadvertently kills civilians			1
@entity40 feeds on these mistakes , selling them as a global @entity148 crusade against @entity112			0
until recently the @entity10 demanded @entity144 troops leave before they enter serious talks with the @entity22 government			1
the @entity32 and the @entity22 government have demanded the @entity10 publicly cut ties with @entity40 first , ensuring the global terrorists can never return			1
but 10 years of war have not turned the tide			0
i 've watched year after year			0
as long ago as 2002 , i was embedded with @entity32 troops in the mountain valleys near @entity160 in @entity3 , when they were handing out radio sets to @entity22			1
it was an inducement for them to hand over information about @entity10 leaders in the @entity167			1
the same men are still being hunted today			0
it did n't work then , and it does n't work today			0
loyalty can not be bought , and is rented only rarely and unreliably			0
the equation is simple : no one will rat out a well - armed neighbor unless they 're sure of protection 24/7			0
in @entity3 no one gets that , except president @entity178			1
and on the subject of @entity178 , his last election victory was marred by allegations of vast fraud that even he has not been able to lay to rest			0
efforts to build a nation around his flawed veneer are failing			0
@entity144 plans to use its troops to provide security until @entity22 forces are deemed ready			1
but as every @entity22 farmer who may or may not have an inkling of @entity10 activity knows , if you ca n't trust the president , how can you trust the forces who might come in his name to protect you ? the @entity10 see this and exploit it			1
the cycle of violence that leads to occasional civilian causalities continues			0
writ large , it means for all the well - meaning @entity144 effort , it is struggling to find a tipping point to bring the @entity10 to their knees and sever the @entity40 connection once and for all			1
agendas have been set for @entity144 troops to leave over the next three years			1
@entity22 fear the resumption of the civil war already under way as 9/11 was sprung on the world			0
the @entity10 had all but a tiny sliver of land in the far northeast controlled by ethnic @entity218			1
it was there that @entity32 special forces first entered the country			1
little surprise that those same northerners have benefited well from their early alliance			0
today they are well armed and well equipped			0
a new civil war would be a highly - energized affair			0
those @entity22 who fret over @entity144 's departure are right to be disturbed			1
the country has become a far more dangerous place			0
in the past decade a new highway from the capital @entity235 to @entity13 seemed to symbolize a brave new future for @entity3			1
it slashed the drive from 16 hours to four			0
i drove it a few times before the @entity10 shut it down			1
it was the same highway that @entity18 , my cameraman , and i drove just after 9/11			0
we 'd bumped and bounced over its entire 300 mile sand and rock surface to reach our @entity13 office , train the two brothers , hand them the camera and phone before being forced out of the country			2
when i look back it saddens me immensely			0
so many lives have been lost			0
both of the @entity13 brothers are dead			0
one brother was murdered a few years ago			0
he was killed by a bomb placed outside his grocery store in @entity9 where he 'd fled @entity3 's violence for the safety of his family			1
the other brother , i was told , had been killed in a roadside blast in his hometown , @entity265 , in @entity266			0
even now all this time later when both of them are dead we can not reveal their names for fear of endangering their families			0
they were amiable , educated young men -- the seed of the country 's future , forever lost to the violence that still wracks their nation , winnowing out a generation of its promising sons .			0

@entity286 and his crew were forced to leave @entity3 by the @entity10
the @entity10 were forced from power after the *september* 11 , 2001 attacks on the @entity32
but the @entity10 have since regrouped and re-emerged , building on their @entity104 support
until recently they demanded @entity144 troops leave before they enter serious peace talks
