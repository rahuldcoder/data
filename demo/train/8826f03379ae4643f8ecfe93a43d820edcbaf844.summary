-- @entity2 education secretary @entity1 said saturday that he plans to recruit more @entity4 and @entity5 teachers in a bid to narrow achievement gaps among students			1
@entity4 - @entity4 males make up less than 2 percent of teachers nationwide , @entity1 told @entity0 , while african - american and @entity5 males -- combined -- represent roughly 3.5 percent of all @entity2 teachers			1
" that 's not a number we can be proud of , " @entity1 said			2
" because so many of our young men grow up in single parent families , they grow up without a strong male presence in their household			2
they need to be surrounded by mentors and role models who can help them envision a positive future for themselves , " he added			1
earlier this month , he told @entity0 's " @entity30 , @entity2 " that the dropout rate in african - american and @entity5 communities in many areas is as high as 50 percent			1
" this is economically unsustainable and morally unacceptable , " he said then			0
" if we want to close achievement gaps , if we want to make sure that many more @entity4 and @entity5 male students are graduating rather than dropping out ... having those teachers , having those role models , having those coaches is going to make a huge difference in their lives , " @entity1 said			1
he added he is planning a campaign in the fall to recruit the next generation of teachers			0
" we have to get dramatically better and we 're committed to doing that , " he said			0
separately on saturday , he told activists at a rally to mark the 47th anniversary of @entity48 's " @entity53 " speech that education is " the civil rights issue of our generation			0
" he urged people to stop being complacent and " step up " to demand excellence in schools			0
