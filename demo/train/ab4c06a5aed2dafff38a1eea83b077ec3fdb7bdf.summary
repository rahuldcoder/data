@entity0 , @entity1 -- opposition lawmakers tuesday ridiculed president @entity4 for taking @entity1 back into @entity6 's military command after more than 40 years , but were unable to stop the move when it came to a vote			1
@entity1 troops on patrol with the @entity13 army as part of the @entity6 mission in @entity13			2
the @entity16 voted in favor of @entity4 's plan , 329 - 238			1
socialist @entity19 , a former prime minister , told prime minister @entity21 : " you tell us this would mean more independence and more influence			0
it would probably mean less independence and less influence			0
" the move did not technically require parliamentary approval , but the president 's party scheduled the debate to give opponents a chance to voice their opinions -- and to show a majority backed it			2
asking the @entity16 to vote on the issue also showed how sensitive the matter is in @entity1			1
@entity1 was a founding member of the @entity6 alliance in 1949 but it left the military structure in 1966 amid friction with the @entity46			1
" to cooperate is to lose your independence , " @entity1 president @entity47 said at the time			1
for the next 43 years , even though @entity1 selectively participated in @entity6 military operations , @entity47 's principle remained the governing cornerstone of @entity1 foreign policy			1
if @entity0 took orders from @entity6 military commanders , it was reasoned , the nation would no longer have complete control of its destiny			0
@entity4 , however , believes the opposite -- that cooperation in @entity6 is a guarantee of @entity1 independence			1
rejoining @entity6 's military command , he argued , will give @entity1 a seat at the table for decision - making			2
from its earliest years , the organization 's trans - @entity69 ties were strained because @entity46 analysts warned that if the @entity74 allies failed to increase their contributions to the alliance , they risked losing the support of the @entity46 , according to @entity6			0
meanwhile , the @entity74 nations felt the @entity46 was trying to dominate the organization , according to @entity6			0
@entity47 's 1966 decision meant no @entity1 forces could be under permanent allied command and that @entity1 would have no participation in defense planning			1
in 1995 , @entity1 rejoined @entity6 's military committee , which advises @entity6 's political authorities on military policy and strategy and provides guidance on military matters to @entity6 's strategic commanders			2
while @entity1 was still not a part of the military command , it contributed troops and funding to @entity6 activities , including actions in @entity98 and @entity13			0
half of all @entity1 troops outside the country are assigned to @entity6 military operations			0
opponents of @entity4 's move -- who include some members of his party -- believe @entity47 , not @entity4 , had it right			1
they started a last - minute petition drive to stop his march back into @entity6			0
" with this decision , @entity1 will return as a subordinate country and will lose its ability to represent another image in the world , " said @entity111 , a member of the @entity16			2
the president 's allies calculate @entity4 's move will strengthen @entity74 's hand on defense issues			1
" there will be more @entity74 weight in the way decisions will be made , " said @entity121 , a member of the @entity16 's @entity122			0
" therefore , the balance of power between the @entity46 and @entity74 will be re-established within this @entity1 move			0
" @entity2 's @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report			0

@entity16 backs president 's plan to rejoin @entity6
president @entity4 's plan is politically sensitive
@entity1 was a founding member of @entity6 but left in 1966
president @entity47 said in 1966 membership meant losing independence
