got bottled water ? food ? sandbags ? batteries ? toilet paper ? those are questions that millions of people in the mid-atlantic and @entity7 are asking themselves this weekend , as they prepare for @entity9 -- which has already proven to be a deadly storm and is threatening heartache , and headaches , as it creeps toward the region			1
local and state officials have joined meteorologists in trumpeting the storm 's potential breadth and impact , especially if it collides with a cold front from the @entity23 to create a " superstorm " that stalls over the @entity25 for days			1
computer models predict portions of @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 could see up to a foot of rain , according to the @entity33			0
and even though it 's still october , communities in and around the @entity35 could be socked by heavy snow			1
a state - by - state breakdown of hurricane preparation efforts @entity39 , for one , has gotten the hint -- and , as evidenced by her fruitless trips friday night to @entity30 supermarkets , pharmacies and big - box stores such as @entity45 , so , too , have many of her neighbors			1
she found no c or @entity49 batteries and no small water bottles , but did come away with other essentials just in case the storm knocks out her electricity			1
" basically , i got ( jugs of ) water , toilet paper , paper towels , paper plates , paper cups , flashlights , " @entity39 said saturday in @entity55			0
" the reason i did it last night was because i knew if i waited until today , i 'd have to drive like 50 miles to find the place that still had it			1
" @entity9 already disrupting transportation the rush to stay ahead of the storm is something that @entity71 noticed , too , as he stood in front of empty shelves at his ace hardware store in the @entity75			1
if the emphatic warnings from officials were n't enough , fresh memories of recent long stretches without power over the past year or so -- including a devastating and deadly storm system this summer that left millions in the dark for about a week -- have spurred many to get out and not be caught flat - footed			1
keep a hurricane preparation checklist " people are a little bit more , hey , maybe i should go get my batteries now instead of waiting until they 're all gone , " @entity71 said			1
for some , simply stocking up is not enough			2
residents of @entity90 's barrier islands , from @entity91 south to @entity92 , were ordered to evacuate by sunday afternoon , as were people at @entity95 casinos			1
" i would much rather people stay in their homes , " said gov. @entity96 , who issued the order saturday			2
" but the fact of the matter is , if we 're looking at hurricane force winds on the barrier islands sustained for 24 hours or more , it is simply unsafe for people to be there			1
" @entity108 said she was concerned , but wo n't be leaving her @entity110 home -- because she does n't have anywhere else to go			0
others , though , planned to abide by the order -- and keep their fingers crossed that @entity9 does n't prove to be as fierce as feared			1
" i 'm heeding the warning and we 're going , " @entity115 told @entity33 affiliate @entity116			0
" and i 'm hoping that i have a house when i come back			0
" it wo n't be until late sunday , and in some cases monday , when the category 1 hurricane makes its full impact known on the @entity125			2
but the storm , which saturday night boasted 75 mph sustained winds that extend out 105 miles from its center , has already proved its might as it spun northward from the @entity132			1
officials blame @entity9 for at least 45 deaths			1
that figure includes 29 people in @entity139 , with four more reported missing , @entity136 spokesman @entity135 said			2
another 16 people were reported dead in @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , the @entity144 and @entity145			2
while locales as far south as @entity149 , @entity150 , got drenched , strong winds and pelting rains lashed @entity152 's @entity151 late saturday afternoon			1
the @entity153 estimates places such as @entity155 will get between 4 to 7 inches of rain over several days , though storm surges were a parallel and , in some places , more severe concern			2
farther south in @entity162 , @entity152 , @entity161 raised hurricane warning flags over his seaside bar saturday			2
" it 's going to be a ... strong mullet blow , what we call here in the fall , " @entity161 told @entity33 affiliate @entity166			2
" ( there will ) be a lot of rain and maybe 30 , 40 mph winds			2
" ' superstorm ' meets barnstorm as weather and politics collide as of 11 p.m. , @entity9 was centered about 360 miles east - southeast of @entity149 and 305 miles south of @entity179 , @entity152 , according to the @entity180			1
now heading northeast at a 14 mph rate , the storm is expected eventually to boomerang toward the shore and begin seriously impacting heavily populated areas sunday			0
forecasters are still trying to pinpoint where it will its biggest impact when it finally does come entirely over land			0
computer models show it striking somewhere along a roughly 700 - mile stretch -- from @entity152 to as far north as @entity193			0
its potential merger with the cold front could " energize this system " and make it more powerful , said @entity194 , who is responsible for environmental prediction at the @entity196			0
such a scenario is not unlike the weather system that led to 1991 's " @entity202 , " when moisture flung north by @entity204 combined with a high pressure system and a cold front to produce a tempest in the north @entity95 during @entity208			1
but @entity204 never made landfall			0
@entity210 safety : when the lights go out @entity213 headed on saturday to @entity214 , like many other @entity215 , residents , to fill up her car 's trunk with sandbags that she 'll pass onto her daughter , who has two babies at home			1
amid all the frenzy , @entity213 said she 's gotten the point			0
" i just turned off the news , " she said			0
" it 's too much			0
" some have resigned themselves to the fact that @entity229 is in charge -- and that , whatever they do , it wo n't stop the wind , rain or storm surges			0
" the most stressful thing is to stand in your house , watch the water come up , and there 's nothing you can do , " @entity237 , @entity30 , resident @entity236 told @entity33 affiliate @entity238			0
" it 's going to keep coming			0
and then you 're stuck , because now you ca n't get out of your house			0
" stay well - fed in any disaster			0
