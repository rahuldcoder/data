after letting her 7 - year - old son walk from their home to a park to play , a @entity1 mother faces up to five years in jail for child neglect			1
@entity8 , 34 , was arrested on july 26 after her son , @entity9 , was found by police alone in a park less than a half - mile from her @entity13 home			1
on saturday afternoon , @entity8 had given @entity17 permission to walk to @entity18 , a route he 's familiar with since he uses it to ride his bike to school , her lawyer said			2
on the way , he passed a public pool , and someone asked him where his mother was			0
" they asked me a couple questions , and i got scared , so i ran off to the park and they called the cops , " @entity28 told @entity30 affiliate @entity29			2
an officer arrived at the park where @entity9 was playing a short time later			2
" @entity9 checked in with his mom a few minutes before the police came and was getting ready to go home for dinner , " said @entity8 's attorney , @entity39 , founder of the @entity41 - based civil liberties group the @entity40			1
he always has a cell phone with him and was wearing it in a case around his neck that his mother had made			2
according to @entity39 , the phone had fallen out of his pocket recently and she did n't want him to lose it			2
when the officer asked @entity9 whether his mother knew where he was , the child told him that she did and he 'd just spoken to her on the phone , according to the police report			2
@entity9 told the police his name , address and mother 's name but was n't able to answer when asked for his date of birth			2
he was then driven home			0
@entity66 arrested after leaving 9 - year - old alone at park " when i saw the police cars pull up in my driveway , and the officers started asking me about @entity9 , i was frantic to know whether he was ok , " @entity8 told @entity30 in an e-mail			1
according to the report , @entity8 told the officer that she let her son go to the park alone once or twice a week			2
the arresting officer said that @entity8 had failed to provide her son with care and supervision by allowing him to cross the street and go to the park alone			2
according to the report , he told her that there had been recent criminal activity in and around the park and a number of sex offenders lived nearby			0
@entity8 was arrested on a felony child neglect charge and taken to jail , leaving @entity9 and her 17 - year - old daughter at the house with her boyfriend			1
she was released seven hours later on $ 3,750 bond			0
the @entity93 has not responded to requests for comment			0
as of thursday afternoon , @entity8 's attorney still had n't received notice of a preliminary hearing			1
a representative from the @entity1 state attorney told @entity30 that the case had n't been assigned to a prosecutor yet			1
" this is a small town and a safe area , " @entity39 said			0
" @entity8 knows she 's not guilty of anything , and she 'll plead that way if it comes to it			0
" on wednesday , @entity8 met with an employee from the @entity109 who told her the charges would likely be dropped , according to @entity39			1
" i 'm really sad about how this has already impacted our family , " @entity8 wrote in an e-mail to @entity30			0
" my son is worried that i 'll get in trouble if he goes outside			0
i 'm even worried about getting in trouble if i let him walk down my driveway alone			0
" a number of child neglect arrests are gaining attention nationwide , with some onlookers arguing local authorities are overstepping bounds in arresting parents for childrearing decisions that would n't have merited notice a generation ago or which plunge families close to the poverty line into even more dire situations			1
" something has shifted and now we 're in the middle of a dangerous societal trend of arresting parents for noncriminal activities , " @entity39 said			0
does leaving kids alone make parents criminals ? in early july , @entity141 of @entity142 made national news after being arrested after letting her 9 - year - old daughter play unattended in a nearby park while she worked			1
she lost her job at @entity147 but has since gotten it back and regained custody of her child , according to her attorney , @entity150			1
she 's awaiting trial , and the @entity153 case against her is still open			0
in march , @entity155 was arrested in @entity156 , @entity157 , on two counts of felony child abuse after leaving her two children in her @entity161 for about an hour while she interviewed for a job			1
on july 18 , she reached a settlement with the @entity164 dismissing her case if she completes a diversion program			0
along with parenting and substance - abuse classes , @entity155 is required to establish education and child - care trusts for each of her three children , two of which are still in state custody			1
@entity1 's child neglect statute has no age written into the law			1
many states do not specify an age at which a child can be legally left at home or allowed to go places alone			1
this leaves some parents unsure of when it 's appropriate or even legal to leave a child unsupervised			0
the @entity109 said in a statement that people who believe they 've witnessed a case of neglect can call a hotline to report it			0
" the hotline can be called when a child of any age is without adult supervision or arrangements appropriate for the child 's age or mental or physical condition , so that the child is unable to care for the child 's own needs or another 's basic needs or is unable to exercise good judgment in responding to any kind of physical or emotional crisis , " according to the statement			1
but the resource is little help to parents who are trying to figure out at what age they can legally allow their children to go out into the world alone			0
" parents i talk to are nervous about doing anything , thinking they could get charged for something without knowing what they 're doing wrong , " @entity221 you think authorities are simply doing their job by arresting parents who let young children go places alone , or are they overreacting ? share your opinion in the comments section below .			0
