-- there are no rules to naming a startup			2
and most entrepreneurs do assume that the name they choose will change before their businesses really start to gain momentum			2
consequently , it does n't shock us that some of our favorite startups were sired by picking names out of hats , by throwing out odd proper nouns that might be cheap domain names and by haphazardly removing vowels			1
ever wonder what a " @entity19 " is , or who the " @entity18 " is ? we 've asked nine startups to share the story behind their names			1
twitter the name @entity19 was picked out of a hat			2
a small group of employees from @entity28 , the @entity30 podcasting startup where @entity19 initially began , had a brainstorming session			2
they were trying to come up with names that fit with the theme of a mobile phone buzzing an update in your pocket			1
after narrowing down the options ( which included @entity41 and @entity19 ) , they wrote them down , put them in a hat , and let fate decide			2
@entity46 decided on @entity19 ( because clearly asking someone if they saw your latest " jeep " is just weird )			2
foursquare dodgeball , @entity52 's first attempt at social networking for mobile phones , was acquired by @entity55 in 2005			1
when @entity55 killed the project , @entity52 founded an improved location - based social game he named @entity50			1
does @entity52 have some sort of unresolved childhood issues relating to playground games ? as it turns out , no he does n't			1
" @entity52 chose to name both companies after playground games because they were both designed to be fun and playful , " said @entity50 's pr manager in an email			1
apparently , @entity50 was always @entity52 's first choice , but the domain name was n't available at the time he founded @entity69			1
@entity70 @entity70 has been a sleek website where users can type or email their questions , to then be answered by the appropriate people in their own social networks			1
but co-founder @entity77 's idea began as a chat buddy that could intermediate conversations with people you know online			1
there were advantages to having this name at the top of the buddy list , a spot which was occupied on @entity77 's buddy roster by his friend @entity89			1
alphabetically speaking , there are n't many options that trump @entity89			1
" @entity70 " is one of the few names that could shoulder him out			1
other factors the name had going for it were its ability to conjugate the invented active verb " vark , " and being an animal that people recognized but typically did n't have strong associations with			2
" we also felt that an animal had the right positioning as helpful but not perfect , " said @entity77 in an email			2
" if we chose a human or a robot mascot people would spend their time trying to make it look stupid , but they 'd cut an animal more slack			1
" @entity55 recently announced it would soon shutter @entity70			1
users have until september 30 to retrieve their data			2
@entity114 @entity114 founders @entity115 and @entity116 crossed " spot " and " identify " when they named their digital music service			0
@entity120 " in the early days of the company , the name does n't really matter for anything			0
you always assume you 'll change it later ... you should be able to own a word for your company			0
you should not have any baggage associated with the name			0
" what we started doing is saying , we want to invent a word , we know that , so let 's just start making syllables without faces and when we have something that sounds good , check and see if the domain name is available ... we 'd just make these weird sounds and then run to the computer and see if it was available			0
we bought the domain name for $ 7			0
@entity142 @entity142 is named after ceo @entity144 's late @entity143 , @entity145			0
the name means @entity148 warrior princess			0
@entity149 from a spokesperson : the origin of the word " @entity149 " is shrouded in mystery			0
only our founder @entity154 knows for sure , and he often throws out red herrings			0
some widely - publicized ( and certainly fabricated ) versions of the story include : a reference to a magic word in a @entity163 film , the name of his grandmother 's favorite childhood pet , and something about a @entity170 directory , i think it 's " / etc , " pronounced " @entity172 " other fun facts ( some of which may actually be factual ) : phonetically , @entity149 has many homonyms too			1
it can mean : -- " and if " in @entity177 -- " horny " in @entity178 -- a slur for " loose woman " in @entity182 - speaking parts of @entity184 / @entity183 -- oh , and it rhymes with " @entity186			0
@entity187 @entity187 ceo @entity188 says the company picked @entity187 ( pronounced " skribbed " ) beause of its ties to writing and publishing			0
more interesting is how the coppany decided on the name of its mobile reader app , float			0
" we wanted something to highlight the floating reading experience , " @entity188 says			0
" namely , the idea of reading without boundaries			0
@entity18 after discarding names like " @entity207 " ( if there were a good travel deal , you 'd pounce , right ? ) and @entity210 ( travel , but true ) , @entity18 co-founder @entity208 was discussing the naming roadblock with his girlfriend			1
she suggested they go with a cute animal so that they could have a cool logo			0
@entity218 was auctioning for about $ 70 at a time , and so the name -- and admittedly adorable logo -- were born			0
