-- the 152 - year - old @entity1 is back on home soil , after a surprise win by @entity4 in @entity6 's most famous horse race			1
bred in @entity7 but owned and trained in @entity6 , @entity4 's victory will be sweet for local horse trainers and racing fans , who have seen the cup go to international entries in recent years			1
the six - year - old stallion took the winner 's share of the aud6 million ( usd6.2 million ) prize money , beating @entity18 second and @entity20 third			1
@entity4 was ridden by @entity22 - based @entity6 jockey @entity21			2
the win also marks the fourth time a horse owned by @entity26 , an @entity6 businessman and property developer , has won the high - stakes contest that is watched by millions across the country			2
@entity4 was an early contender but questions emerged over his form after a disappointing seventh place at his last race just over a week ago			0
six of the eight favorites in this year 's race were from overseas and were dubbed by @entity6 media as " international invaders			1
" last year 's winner was dunaden , a @entity42 stallion and another @entity42 horse -- @entity44 -- won the race in 2010			1
" there is nothing like winning the @entity1			0
the @entity51 cup is @entity6 , " says trainer @entity48 , whose horse shocking won in 2009			2
" any other race i do n't think it would really matter but the @entity1 is such an @entity6 icon that it is hard for them to stomach that it might be leaving @entity6 shores , " he told @entity0 's @entity52			1
home - grown entries have been overshadowed by foreign contenders as a lucrative prize pot lures horses bred and trained mainly in @entity61			1
the prize money has become all the more tantalizing in the past few years as the @entity6 dollar has strengthened against other major currencies , making it worth the $ 150,000 it costs to transport and stable the horses during their stay down under			1
" well they 've got to travel half way across the globe , they 've got to settle in and they 've got to get used to our dry @entity6 tracks but at the end of the day there is six million @entity6 dollars waiting for them so there are plenty of them that are going to have a crack , " @entity48 said before this year 's race			1
it 's hard to overstate the significance of the race in the @entity6 sporting and social calendar			2
imagine the party atmosphere of the @entity90 with the tradition and pageantry of the @entity93 and @entity94			0
a novice 's guide to the @entity1 held at @entity98 , the race meet attracts some 100,000 punters dressed in their finest hats and formal attire , along with more comical takes on the occasion			2
it is also watched by millions at bars , homes and outdoor screens across the country			0
" there are race meetings , i understand , in other parts of the world			0
but no - one promotes their race like we do , " @entity113 , the lord mayor of @entity51 , told @entity0			0
" i mean who else has a public holiday for a horse race ? we do and we think it 's perfectly natural			2
" the race , part of a week - long meeting , also has a huge economic impact for the city , with millions bet and more spent			0
race goers alone are estimated to spend nearly $ 30 million during the week , while the carnival and other events that accompany it bring in $ 350 million , @entity113 said			0
@entity1 memories : the legs that stopped a nation @entity136 horse trainer @entity135 , who has twice narrowly missed out on winning the cup , says another reason why there are more international entries is because @entity61 horses tend to be bred for covering longer distances compared to their @entity6 counterparts			1
however , he says the international horses have their own obstacles to overcome			0
the animals have to travel for 50 to 60 hours and then face two weeks of quarantine			0
quarantine regulations also make it difficult for international trainers to bring in their own food so the horses have to get used to the local cuisine			0
" which is not a help and they suffer from jetlag just the same as people do and they take quite a while to adjust , " he told @entity0 's @entity52			0
@entity48 , like most @entity6 trainers , is not particularly sympathetic to the foreign horses ' plight , but as long as the prize money remains high , it 's likely that entrants will come from far and wide .			1
