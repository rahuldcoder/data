-- fourteen people have died so far from the @entity3 outbreak that began earlier this month in @entity4			1
according to the @entity6 , the first case is believed to be from the @entity8 village in @entity9 , a sub-county of the @entity11 district of @entity4			1
so far , 36 suspected cases have been reported , @entity6 spokesman @entity12 said tuesday			1
nine of the deaths are reported to have occurred in one household ; a health official who was treating one of the patients also died			2
unfortunately family members and health officials - those caring for the already sickened - are the most likely to be infected as well			0
when was @entity3 first discovered ? the ebola virus was first detected in 1976 in the @entity24 nation of @entity25 ( now the @entity25 )			1
the virus is named after a river in that country , where the first outbreak of the disease was found			0
there are five species of @entity3 viruses , all named after the areas they were found in : @entity25 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , according to the @entity6			1
( there can be different strains of @entity3 within each species )			1
health officials have determined that the @entity36 species is the culprit in this current outbreak , which is among the three more lethal species of @entity3			1
the fatality ratios of ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreaks in @entity50 are between 25 % and 90 % , according to a @entity6 fact sheet			1
so far only the @entity39 species of @entity3 has been found to infect humans and not cause serious illness or death			2
what are the symptoms of @entity3 and is there a cure ? initial symptoms of @entity3 can be mistaken for other illnesses like the flu because they can be very similar : sudden high fever , joint and muscle pain and sore throat			1
but @entity3 victims then often get bloody diarrhea and / or start vomiting , followed by rashes , red eyes , and internal and external bleeding ( bloody nose or gums )			2
early reports from this outbreak suggest more patients were suffering from vomiting and diarrhea than visible external bleeding			0
but health officials caution that information about this outbreak is still very scattered and the investigation has just begun			0
there is no treatment for @entity3 and no vaccine			1
all doctors can do is provide patients with supportive care , like replenishing fluids and electrolytes , keeping their blood pressure and oxygen levels in check and treating any infections that might occur , according to the @entity95			0
there 's a lot that 's not known about this disease , but researchers suspect that " patients who die usually have not developed a significant immune response to the virus at the time of death , " according to a @entity95 fact sheet			0
how does it spread ? researchers do not know what the natural reservoir of the ebola virus is			1
but they have found its cousin virus - @entity110 , which also causes hemorrhagic fever - in fruit bats in @entity50			0
while there are no known cases of a human being directly infected with @entity3 by a bat , sources tell @entity0 , there are two documented cases of humans being infected with the marburg virus after being in a cave full of fruit bats			1
however , researchers believe humans are infected either by handling of dead or alive infected animals ( like chimpanzees , gorillas and forest antelopes ) , or by being in direct close contact with someone who is sick with or has already died from @entity3			2
the virus can be found in bodily fluids like blood , urine , diarrhea and saliva , so direct contact with these fluids from infected humans or animals , can lead to the transmission			0
people can also become infected by coming into contact bodily secretions found on needles , scalpels , soiled clothes and linens			0
can @entity3 be contained ? once an outbreak has been identified , the transmission of the virus can be prevented , if proper precautions are taken			1
avoiding contact with body fluids from someone sickened with @entity3 is key			2
that means wearing proper personal protection equipment like gloves , gowns , masks and eye protection			0
hospitals will also set up isolation wards to isolate @entity3 patients from other patients			2
officials tell @entity0 that while those caring for the actively sick need to wear @entity167 ( personal protection equipment ) , someone walking through a village where a patient was sick would n't need to wear a mask because the virus is n't airborne			0
could this outbreak spread to the @entity174 or other distant countries ? experts think it 's unlikely the current outbreak would spread to the @entity174			0
while the only example of transmission of @entity3 in the @entity174 came with the importation of research monkeys ( no humans were sickened ) , there was a situation four years ago where two tourists traveling in @entity4 were infected with @entity110 hemorrhagic fever			2
both patients returned to their home countries , according to the @entity95			0
one survived and the other died , but nobody else was infected because proper protections were taken during treatment			0
when is an outbreak considered ' finished ' ? the incubation period for @entity3 is two to 21 days , according to the @entity6			1
health officials tell @entity0 an outbreak is considered to be over following two incubation periods after the last person becomes ill - a total of 42 days .			0
