-- this holiday season , families will gather by the fire -- or most likely by the television set -- to spend some quality time together , recording memories more valuable than any money could buy			1
even during such precious moments though , the specter of materialism remains an ever present force			1
for as we all know , @entity11 would n't be nearly as much fun without @entity14 paying us a fruitful visit			0
and come january , tempers fray when those eagerly awaited presents start to lose their shine and the bills need settling			0
that paradox was perhaps unwittingly highlighted by two of the world 's most influential characters this year : one was the @entity25 ; the other the mayor of @entity28			2
and just as the gap between rich and poor continues to yawn alarmingly wide , so too it seems does the difference in their approaches to money and the inequality it creates			2
using the first peace message of his pontificate to preach against the cult of high finance , @entity37 railed against huge salaries and bonuses			2
" how can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure , " he asked , " but it is news when the stock market loses 2 points ? " without " rejecting the absolute autonomy of the markets and financial speculation ...			0
. no solution will be found for the world 's problems , " he said			0
the 77 year - old pontiff 's criticism of the capitalist system has been so scathing of late that he has been forced to deny he is a closet @entity64 after arguing today 's " idolization of money " was n't just morally wrong , it was devastating for society			1
" such an economy , ' he said , ' kills			0
" but does it really ? or does it motivate rather than maim ? @entity71 , who granted is n't always mentioned in the same sentence as his holiness , told @entity74 recently to embrace the worship of wealth			1
not only was greed good , he suggested in echoes of @entity79 's famous corporate raider @entity80 , but the need to " keep up with the @entity82 's " was a powerful social stimulant for those who managed to maintain their place on life 's treadmill			0
and for those who lost their footing ? in @entity71 's usual semi-serious view : charity -- not @entity91 -- would provide			1
" inequality is essential for the spirit of envy , " he said , " stimulating brain activity , " and countering falling wages elsewhere			0
while the extreme views of @entity28 's mayor may have shocked many outside the capital 's affluent postcodes , a quick survey of my @entity100 followers threw up the surprising revelation that even during these days of hardship , @entity71 's unique brand of trickle down economics was n't quite as unpopular as expected			1
many called him a realist			0
in fairness , @entity71 's speech was a calculated power play for the @entity117 's hardline @entity116 base , who have the luxury of planning how to build upon their net worth			2
by contrast , pope @entity37 's words offer a thought provoking appeal for altruism to counter an increasingly selfish world			1
perhaps predictably , they come from the heart of a man who has experienced hardships first hand , as a son of poor immigrants in @entity135 , who when elected to lead the @entity136 chose the name of a saint who turned his back on a life of riches			0
the two messages -- one cruel , the other caring -- if anything are evidence of today 's increasingly polarized views on the importance of fortune and fate in today 's post-austerity era			1
that 's a debate which will become more prominent in 2014 as the economy flourishes once more and electorates ask themselves what they have learned from the last boom - and - bust cycle			0
either way , if there is one thing these two statements do show it 's that money -- however idolatrous it may be -- is just as important for bringing people together as much as tearing them apart			2
as we probably learn every holiday season as we sit down to unwrap those parcels ...			1

even during the holiday season , the specter of materialism remains , writes @entity0 's @entity166
pope @entity37 argued today 's " idolization of money was devastating for society , she says
@entity174 @entity173 : @entity71 , however , told @entity74 to embrace the worship of wealth
both messages are evidence of today 's polarized views on fortune and fate , she writes
