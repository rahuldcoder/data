-- @entity1 , a student who is the first person from her family to go to college , sees something of herself in the first @entity6 woman to be nominated to the @entity8 @entity7			1
judge @entity9 would be the first @entity6 person to serve on the @entity7			1
" to me , as a student that comes from a low - income background , i think she 's a true example of the fact that when you 're wanting to achieve something , it 's truly possible , regardless of your background , " said @entity18 , a 20 - year - old senior at the @entity19			0
on tuesday , president @entity20 nominated @entity9 , a woman of @entity22 descent , to the @entity8 @entity7			1
if confirmed , @entity9 will be the first @entity6 person and only the third woman to serve on the nation 's highest court			1
in the wake of the nomination , hispanics celebrated @entity9 as a symbol of success and also as a reflection of the changing demographics of the country			1
in a sense , she is the @entity6 community 's answer to @entity20 's narrative -- a sign that , as @entity18 said , anything is possible in @entity8 if a person works hard enough , no matter their race or economic situation			1
@entity9 , 54 , a federal judge in @entity44 , rose from humble beginnings			2
she grew up in a @entity47 housing project , supported by her mother , who worked six days a week			0
@entity9 has called her mother her inspiration and said she instilled in her the values of education			1
@entity9 went on to attend @entity53 and @entity54			2
her story of battling past obstacles is an inspiration for all hispanic people , said @entity59 , president - elect of the @entity60			2
" it would be hard for anyone to argue that somehow merit and talent and commitment and perseverance ... does not ultimately yield the kind of achievement that is recognized by everyone , " he said			0
although it may not be possible for everyone to succeed against the odds , " at this juncture , we are closer to the ideal than we have ever been , " @entity59 said			0
gender , ethnicity and socioeconomics are no longer the obstacles they once were , he said			0
advocacy groups had been putting pressure on @entity20 to nominate a minority to fill the @entity7 seat being vacated by retiring justice @entity84			1
minorities on the court have been rare in its 220 - year history			0
all but two of the 110 justices have been men , and only two of them have not been white , according to @entity0 's political unit			0
@entity59 said @entity6 people have been waiting a long time for a person of @entity6 descent to be nominated to the court			1
but he said he 's so excited now that the wait does n't seem to matter			0
" it 's here ! it is the right nominee			0
it is a woman who will make this country and the @entity8 @entity7 proud , so i 'm not going to ask whether it was a long time coming , " he said			2
" i 'm just glad that it is here			0
" @entity108 , a 23 - year - old student at @entity54 , where @entity9 attended , said many people in the @entity6 community feel such excitement about the nomination that they 're almost numb			1
" people are going to remember where they were when they heard about this nomination , " he said			1
the nomination also makes the court a more accurate reflection of @entity8 's racial demographics , @entity59 said			0
@entity6 are the largest minority group in the @entity8 , and their presence is expected to continue to grow			1
about 12.5 percent of people in the @entity8 were @entity6 in the @entity121 , according to the @entity122			1
by mid-century , @entity6 people will make up nearly a quarter of the @entity8 population , the bureau estimates			1
@entity9 's nomination " helps to create a tapestry of this country that is very reflective of the people who live in it , " @entity59 said			1
however , some conservatives in the @entity6 community said a judicial nominee 's ethnic background and life story are not as important as his or her interpretations of the law			2
" while it is laudable and desirable to have a @entity7 that reflects a diversity of views and backgrounds , justices must check these at the @entity7 door , " @entity139 , a @entity140 attorney who was general counsel to former @entity142 gov. @entity141 , said in a prepared statement			2
" personal views must be surrendered in favor of applying the law			0
" @entity153 , spokeswoman for the @entity154 , said @entity155 are inspired by the fact that someone of their ethnic group is being portrayed in such a positive light			2
@entity9 will inspire young @entity155 to chase their dreams , she said			1
" i think her cultural background does give her an advantage in being a role model for these students , " she said			0
" it 's , in a way , redeeming or affirming to see someone who looks like you succeeding in the public sphere			0
" @entity18 , the college student in @entity170 , said she always thought her dream of becoming a prominent @entity173 attorney was possible			0
but @entity9 's nomination serves as proof , she said			2
" it 's always better when there 's precedent and you feel that someone else has been able to do it ; i can do it , too , " she said .			0

if confirmed , @entity9 will be the first @entity6 person on @entity7
@entity155 herald the nomination as a *victory* for the minority group
