@entity0 -- @entity2 floated the idea this week that a primary challenge to president @entity5 will help the president and the country			1
he is flat - out wrong			2
his views are based on a faulty premise and a myth			2
we will start with the faulty premise and get to the myth later			2
remember back to 2000 , when @entity2 himself ran as a third - party candidate ? he 's not proposing that here -- at least not yet -- but it 's important to remember what happens when @entity2 gets involved in challenging a @entity20			1
in 2000 , he siphoned enough votes from @entity22 in @entity23 to swing the election to president @entity25			1
it gave us eight years of @entity28 politics and policies			2
if @entity2 were being honest with himself , he 'd look to 2000 as an example of what the consequences can be for the country and progressive causes when progressives do n't stick together			1
a primary challenge could further divide the party and possibly dampen @entity39 enthusiasm			1
these races could erode our ability to reach swing voters , who are crucial to electoral viability , by forcing candidates to draw a sharper contrast on issues than necessary to win an election			2
on most issues , @entity2 agrees with the @entity39 more than the @entity49			1
by running as an independent and drawing votes in @entity23 that might otherwise have gone to @entity22 , @entity2 helped usher in eight of the worst years our country has ever seen			1
@entity25 ignored or trampled on @entity2 's major concerns			1
look at the record : @entity25 took president @entity55 's budget surplus and squandered it			0
he used part of the surplus to offset the costs of his tax cuts for the wealthiest @entity60			0
he used the rest to begin funding an elective war in @entity63			0
@entity25 policies allowed predatory lenders to dupe families seeking mortgages for homes			0
@entity70 bankers got the green light to play by their own rules			0
@entity25 created the bubble that burst and continues to rain on us			0
@entity25 policies cost millions of @entity60 their jobs			0
middle class workers watched as their wages stagnated			0
they looked on helplessly as corporate executives reaped obese compensation			0
@entity5 took over an economy that was shedding 750,000 jobs every month			1
he came into office with the nation in two wars and with crumbling bridges and superhighways , a health insurance system financially crippling middle class families , plus multiple other domestic maladies			0
we will be dealing with the repercussions of @entity25 's eight years for generations			0
and @entity2 thinks a primary challenge is a good idea ? the question is for whom ? primary challenges against moderates or centrist candidates work both ways			1
does @entity2 suppose the primary challenges in november that wiped out veteran moderate @entity49 legislators and left the national @entity49 where it is today -- with energized extreme right - wing purists almost in control -- was good ? does he really want to be the @entity39 's equivalent of a tea party purist ? @entity2 knows there is another progressive activist : @entity111 , who also seeks to stir a primary challenge against @entity5			1
@entity111 has honest but debatable differences with president @entity5			1
he rightly should challenge every politician to wage a battle against poverty and injustice in the @entity60			2
i see no reason for @entity111 to go beyond his rhetorical challenge to the president to address these issues and hold every elected official more accountable to the middle class and working poor			2
here 's " the myth " : @entity2 's and @entity111 's advocacy of primary challenges is based on the premise that @entity5 neither speaks to nor fights for progressive ideals			1
look at what @entity5 has done , with pit bull opposition fighting him inch by inch			1
@entity5 repeatedly called for a tax system in which all people pay their fair share , including the wealthiest @entity60			1
the steep deficit cut @entity5 proposed this week mandates even - handed taxing and closes the tax loopholes that @entity142 use to slide by with paying taxes at lower rates than their own secretaries do			2
our country witnessed the end of " do n't ask , do n't tell " this week			0
that finally allows brave men and women to serve openly and proudly in our armed forces , regardless of their sexual orientation			0
in less than 30 months , the president signed health insurance reform that expanded everyone 's access to quality , affordable health care			0
he outlawed the use of those so - called pre-existing conditions that forced many @entity60 to go without health insurance or pay exorbitant premiums			0
he signed the @entity164 to end workplace discrimination and to ensure that women receive equal pay for equal work			0
he appointed two highly qualified women , @entity170 and @entity171 , to the @entity172			0
for the first time in our history , there are three female justices			0
the question facing progressives is not whether @entity5 should have a primary challenger			1
rather , it is : do they want to return to the disastrous economic and social policies advocated by the tea party and the @entity49 presidential candidates today ? as @entity22 's former campaign manager , no one knows more than i do what the consequences are of efforts like @entity2 's			1
if he and @entity111 care about the progressive causes they purport to hold dear , they wo n't , still once again , risk putting another @entity49 -- and perhaps another swashbuckling governor from @entity197 -- in the @entity198			2
@entity60 can not afford to go backward			0
it 's time progressives unite for change we all believe in			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			2

@entity2 suggested @entity5 should face primary challenge
@entity205 says @entity2 should *beware* creating @entity39 *disunity*
she says his candidacy in 2000 took *key* votes away from @entity22
@entity205 : progressives should unite to *prevent* @entity49 *victory* in 2012
