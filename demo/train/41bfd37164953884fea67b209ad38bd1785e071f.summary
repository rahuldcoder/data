@entity0 -- in the days and weeks to come , rep. @entity4 ' recovery from a gunshot wound to the head will be a marathon , not a sprint , doctors say			1
nearly three weeks after her brain injury , there are several acute medical issues to be concerned about , according to doctors not involved with her care			1
it could take months -- or longer -- for her to get back to where she was before the bullet ripped through her brain			1
one immediate worry is an infection in her brain , according to dr. @entity23 , chief of neurosurgery at @entity25 in southern @entity26			1
" with gunshot wounds to the head , an infection can still happen , even this late , " @entity23 said			2
the other concern is the buildup of fluid in the brain			1
@entity4 had hydrocephalus after she was shot , a condition where an excess of cerebral - spinal fluid puts pressure on the brain			1
surgeons in @entity40 implanted a drain to get rid of the fluid , and on monday , dr. @entity43 , @entity4 ' neurosurgeon in @entity0 , removed the drain , saying she no longer needed it			1
@entity23 said doctors will be monitoring @entity4 closely to make sure the excess fluid does n't return			1
@entity4 on wednesday moved from the intensive care unit to the @entity49 ( @entity50 ) at @entity25 in @entity0 , where she 'll undergo physical , occupational and speech therapy to try to get her brain back to where it once was			1
her doctors there are optimistic			2
" it 's only been a few weeks since this happened and she has been tolerating our aggressive therapy program , " dr. @entity59 , chief medical officer at @entity60 , told @entity1 's " @entity65			1
" that program began as soon as @entity4 arrived in @entity0 after being transferred from @entity67 , @entity40 's @entity68 , he said , and has been upgraded			1
neurosurgeons on @entity4 ' team describe the brain fluid situation as " stable , " @entity59 said , " but we 're going to monitor that			1
" " neural recovery is a hurry up and wait situation , " @entity23 said			0
" recovering from that injury just takes time			0
" one of the first things doctors will do is try to get @entity4 back to a regular schedule , said dr. @entity79 , medical director of rehabilitation for @entity25			1
" in the intensive care unit , patients get their days and nights mixed up			0
" rehab doctors will give @entity4 a series of tests to assess her physical and cognitive abilities , he said			1
for example , they might ask her to draw a clock			0
" it sounds simple , but sometimes they 'll put in the wrong numbers , or put all the numbers on the right hand side , " he explained			0
" that shows us which part of the brain is having issues			2
" another area doctors will look at is called " executive function , " or the ability to incorporate many different thoughts all at the same time			2
" in our everyday lives , there are snippets of info coming in all at once , and we integrate multiple things that are going on at the same time , " said dr. @entity104 , chairman of the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation at @entity108			0
" obviously , she was really good at that , and hopefully she will be again , " he said			0
with a brain injury , functioning may be impaired depending on what area of the brain was damaged , @entity59 said			2
doctors will watch @entity4 ' functioning closely and modify her therapy program " to address individual impairments and deficits , " he said			1
still , @entity59 said he continues to be surprised at the speed of @entity4 ' recovery			2
" when i see her every day , there is something new , " he said			0
that has been a challenge to her medical team , but provides them opportunities to challenge her as well , he said			0
trying to become the person you once were can be very trying , doctors said			2
" emotionally , this kind of recovery can be very difficult , " @entity104 said			0
" depression rates in this situation are well over 50 %			0
" some brain injuries affect not just a patient 's emotional state , but their basic personality			0
" they may have different behaviors , " @entity79 said			0
" spouses and other family members have to relate to a person who was not necessarily the same person they knew before the injury			0
" all of this requires patience from the patients and their families			0
" people like ( @entity4 ) often have a rocky road , " @entity104 said			2
" but they often get to places that surprise us , and surprise them			0
