-- the year 1990 was not so great for me			1
let 's see : @entity3 beat me up			2
@entity4 rejected my invitation to the senior prom			2
@entity7 rejected my invitation to the senior prom			2
i lost my fifth - straight student council election			1
@entity10 doused me with chocolate milk			2
i was given detention for cutting school			1
my dream college , @entity14 , accepted me -- to its @entity16 campus			2
a mole the size of @entity19 sprouted beneath my nose			2
from september 1989 through june 1990 -- the span of my senior year at @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , -- i never kissed a girl or even held a girl 's hand			2
i never drank a beer , a shot or even a raspberry wine cooler			2
( stop laughing -- they were big back then			2
) i was invited to two parties -- both thrown by my mother			0
my pants were too short , my haircut was in the shape of a cereal bowl , i ruined the car ( a sweet 1980 @entity41 that i accidentally drove through a lake ) and @entity44 was canceled after five seasons on @entity46			0
so why , last saturday , did i attend my 20 - year high school reunion ? easy -- because life is short			1
and if we do n't occasionally force ourselves to face the most uncomfortable of situations , we shrivel up and die in front of the television , a half - eaten bag of stale @entity54 in one hand , the remote control in the other			1
hence , i entered a ballroom at the @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity25 , took a deep breath and confronted the nightmare that was my youth			1
i stared down the cheerleaders , the bullies , the jocks , the brainiacs			0
i looked them over , one by one ; thought about all i had gone through ; all the anger and resentment that had built up deep inside my guts , and i ... and i ... and i ... had one of the best nights of my life			1
if you have a reunion coming up , go ! without hesitation			1
never again will you have a better chance to cleanse yourself , to make peace with the past			0
without making an official proclamation , the reunion served as my farewell to any and all longstanding bitterness			1
i left grudges at the door , and sought out the goodness in those whose formative years had paralleled mine			0
i danced with @entity89 , the girl from the smoking section ( seriously , we had one )			0
i chilled with @entity93 , the popular cheerleader ( and our class celebrity			0
she 's the author of " @entity96 , " my daughter 's favorite book )			0
i shook hands with @entity100 , the star running back , and chatted up @entity101 , the shotputter who was voted track captain over me			1
for the first time , we were all equals -- all nervous , slightly insecure 30 - somethings commiserating over @entity107 and @entity108 and those disgusting slabs of pizza that passed as school lunch			1
but in particular , i paid close attention to the plight of @entity114			0
back in the day , @entity114 was one of the most dynamic athletes we had			0
a staple of the traditional sunday morning flag football games , @entity114 ran like the @entity118 , charged a quarterback like a bull and threw deep bombs with uncanny precision			0
twelve years ago , while playing in one of those games , @entity114 began to inexplicably trip			0
he went to see a doctor , who diagnosed him with @entity127			1
the ensuing years have been arduous			0
now permanently in a wheelchair , @entity114 suffers through unspeakable pain and exasperation			0
yet when he heard of the reunion , something in @entity114 -- like something in myself -- stirred			1
just as this was my chance to eradicate the suffocating bitterness from my youth , here was @entity114 's opportunity to travel back in time , to relish four hours not as the wheelchair - bound @entity127 sufferer , but as @entity140 , the cocksure @entity141 teenager from long ago			1
to watch @entity142 into the room ; to watch the hugs and the high - fives and the long embraces he received from our classmates -- well , it was as powerful a sight as i 've ever witnessed			1
my memories of @entity23 have n't changed			0
i 'll always be the geek who could n't kiss a girl or win an election			0
but , for the first time in 20 years , i want to go back			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			1

@entity158 says he dreaded *revisiting* the *traumas* of youth at his high school reunion
he forced himself to go ( says you should too ) , and had one of the best nights of his life
he hung out with cheer leader , chatted up the sports star , found all had become equals
@entity158 : @entity127 - *stricken* friend at reunion was powerful thing to witness
