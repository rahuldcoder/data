@entity0 -- @entity2 is allowed to stay in the @entity3 -- for now			1
the @entity4 wo n't comment on a petition signed by more than 270,000 asking for the pop star to be deported for his repeated starring role in famous - people - behaving - badly			1
you might not care about the @entity10 and his " beliebers , " but the 20 - year - old 's misbehavior and run - ins with the law raise some serious questions about immigration law enforcement			1
like , is @entity2 getting some serious special treatment ? president @entity20 has deported more people than any other president , causing him to be known as the " deporter - in - chief " in some sectors of the immigration community			1
but is n't @entity2 here legally ? he sure is			1
but it 's not only illegal immigrants who are receiving deportation orders			2
the @entity30 estimated that 10 % of the people deported between 1997 and 2007 were legally living in the @entity3			1
while the @entity20 administration deported nearly 1.6 million people in the last four years , it 's unclear how many were in the country legally			1
the administration does n't reveal those statistics			1
an immigration tracking division of @entity38 , @entity39 , is currently suing the @entity40 for failing to release a wide range of data on deportations and detentions			2
but immigration advocates believe the number has gone up since @entity20 came into office , not only due to an increase in deportations , but also because of anecdotal evidence			2
they are seeing an increase in home raids of legal residents and there are stories like that of @entity58 veteran @entity57 , who was deported in 2010 over a years - old drug offense			2
yes , legal residents are getting kicked out because of a previous crime			0
according to a 1996 immigration law , it does n't matter how long ago people committed their crime and the types of crimes eligible for deportation are vast and expanding			1
for instance , shoplifting and marijuana possession often qualify			0
@entity2 has a lot of potential charges under his belt			0
in january he was charged with driving under the influence in @entity76			0
he also has a pending assault charge and separate vandalism charges for egging his neighbor 's house			0
as with all deportations , the president has the " inherent power to choose which cases to act on , " said @entity85 , immigration law professor at the @entity87 's @entity86			1
it 's called " prosecutorial discretion			0
" @entity20 said he ca n't stop deportations of immigrants , but maybe he can but fortunately for @entity2 -- and possibly the president who would upset millions of teen fans -- is that his @entity94 is not a deportable offense			2
his vandalism charge probably is n't either			2
his assault charge might be , experts say			0
@entity99 , legislative fellow at the @entity30 , said @entity2 could potentially be charged with a crime of moral turpitude , which he described as " an abstract concept whose definition has expanded over the years			0
" in sum , it 's a judgment of a person 's character and intent for purposes of immigration			2
" a good immigration lawyer wo n't let that happen and i 'm sure ( @entity2 ) will be very well represented , " @entity99 said			1
@entity2 also has another advantage			0
he never got a green card			0
@entity2 is in the country on a visa for people with " extraordinary " abilities			0
his visa has to be renewed at some point , however , and moral turpitude could be taken into consideration			0
but , like @entity99 said , his well - paid legal team probably wo n't let that happen			1
@entity2 's attorneys are reportedly working out a plea deal for some of @entity2 's crimes			0
if his legal team is any good , they would advise him that even a plea does n't protect him from future immigration consequences			1
but for many legal immigrants , they do n't have the resources to hire top immigration and criminal attorneys to help navigate the system			1
you get what you pay for .			0
