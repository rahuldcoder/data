-- it was a scene straight out of " @entity2 " : a sea of confused , disgruntled people flooding the streets of @entity6 , left to wonder about their fate			1
the cause of this mayhem : severe thunderstorms , which temporarily forced the evacuation of the second day of @entity12 on saturday			1
all was not lost , however : after a nearly three - hour delay , festival officials reopened the gates and @entity16 was officially back on			1
the suspension did have some irreparable effects			2
several performances -- including those by @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 -- were cancelled , and others were pushed back a few hours or shortened			1
there was also the reality that @entity28 was now a full - on mud bath			2
still , despite being one of the most chaotic days in @entity12 's storied history , when @entity33 took the main stage in late evening , the earlier trouble hardly mattered			1
these were n't the same @entity36 that last played @entity12 in 2006 : guitarist @entity37 was added to the mix following the departure of @entity40 in 2009			1
the @entity42 - led crew delivered a set comprised largely of the classics , aside from opening with the otherworldly percussion of new tune " @entity50 " ( off 2011 album i 'm with you ) , and their trademark fusion of rock , punk and funk riffs was on full display			2
the setlist included everything from the melodic ( " @entity59 ) , " " @entity60 " ) to the mosh - pit friendly rockers ( " @entity62 " ) and even the @entity63 - inspired ( " @entity64 " )			2
the city of @entity6 had extended the festival 's curfew in light of the day 's earlier evacuation , so the band plowed on into the night , finishing their set with a two - song encore that included " @entity73 " and " @entity74			1
" @entity42 donned his usual attire , or lack thereof : the singer was shirtless and wore a mesh hat saluting the @entity81 punk act @entity79 ! flea expressed his love for the fans and pleaded that everyone continue supporting live music " because it 's all we got			1
" after kicking off with his monster hit " levels , " which liberally samples @entity92 ' " @entity95 , " superstar @entity91 shifted through a familiar formula : searing , emotional vocal samples with giant synthesizer riffs			2
each track sent more young fans scrambling towards the @entity102 stage , many caked with mud			0
as his visuals lit up the night sky , framed by @entity6 's beautiful skyscrapers , fans reacted : " @entity91 is one of the hottest techno acts in the world , " explained one			1
another put things in perspective : " @entity114 is cooler , man			0
" fellow @entity117 leader @entity116 inspired mud - dancing and excessive fist - pumping at @entity119			0
" @entity12 , i wan na see you jump up and down , " the @entity121 party - starter instructed the neon - clad masses			1
over the past year , @entity116 has been able to successfully bridge the gap between progressive house and pop music , and his saturday set mirrored his genre - crossing : when he was n't unleashing bass - throbbing beats during " @entity131 , " the @entity91 was dropping the needle on his radio hits , @entity134 's " @entity124 " and his own " @entity135			1
" as @entity91 and the @entity36 battled it out for main - stage supremacy , @entity136 took to the more intimate @entity139			0
" i see we had a little rain , " the breakout @entity141 singer remarked , wearing his usual red and white bandana			0
" i 'm glad you all came back			0
" @entity147 's set was an entirely suave affair : he began by sitting on a chair , serenading the adoring crowd with a cover of @entity153 's " @entity154 " as acoustic guitars backed him lightly			1
later , thanks to his crack four - piece band , @entity147 brought a heavier hand to the @entity162 cut " @entity163 " and the nostalgia , @entity156 hit " @entity165			0
" @entity147 capped his set with the gospel - tinged " @entity168 " -- which he said spoke of his previous love affair with a man -- and the tragic epic " pyramid			0
" the @entity174 , also known as the @entity175 singer @entity174 , is often compared to @entity147 for his floating falsetto and mysterious air			0
when he played the @entity178 earlier in the afternoon , he peppered his set with cuts from his trio of popular mixtapes , beginning with @entity183 in early 2011 and concluding with last december 's @entity184			1
after a winsome " high for this , " the @entity187 opener and first song many heard from @entity174 , the singer blew an adoring kiss to the crowd			0
fittingly enough , no band appeared to enjoy @entity12 as much as @entity193			1
the " @entity195 " group had the unenviable task of reopening the festival post-thunderstorm and more than succeeded in the challenge			1
frontman @entity202 , wearing neon yellow sneakers and unhinged suspenders , bounded onstage to open with " @entity203 , " followed it up with " @entity205 ? " and , despite volume issues , never let up until he brought the house down with the band 's breakout single			1
@entity121 rock band @entity210 played an expectedly energetic set that mostly stuck to the basics of mid- 2000s dance - rock			0
lead singer @entity215 , clad in a black button - up , shook off the post-storm humidity with ease , offering career highlight tracks like " @entity220 " and " @entity221 " early in the set , then tossing out a surprise cover of @entity224 's " @entity225 " before concluding with an impressive drum solo feature			2
@entity228 's set was too brief -- they began nearly fifteen minutes late as they conducted an eleventh - hour soundcheck -- but what they did play was a romantic , emotionally direct show reminiscent of @entity237 teen flicks			2
shrouded by a smoke machine , lead singer @entity228 and his band made the most of their time with minimal stage patter that was as heart - on - sleeve as their music : " turned out to be such a beautiful night			0
" a set highlight was " at my heels , " for which @entity228 poured genuine energy into the performance			0
@entity254 took to @entity256 's stage in a blue - striped polo shirt			2
his performance seemed disjointed , varying between predictable and electrifying			0
at some points , he covered obvious tracks , including the hip - hop staple " crossroads " by @entity263 and @entity264 and 2 @entity266 's current hit " @entity267			2
" he was most interesting when he invigorated the set with @entity270 rave concepts , mixing transcendent piano lines and helium vocals into his emotionally fraught atmosphere			0
