do you want to keep your vision clear as the years go by ? put fish , olive oil , and nuts on the menu , but stay away from trans fats , according to new research from @entity8			2
age - related macular degeneration occurs when blood vessels or cells in the center of the retina break down			1
studies from two different teams published monday in the @entity16 provide more evidence that these foods -- which contain healthy fats -- can reduce the risk of developing a retina - destroying condition known as age - related macular degeneration ( @entity24 )			1
the studies are n't the first to suggest fish and omega - 3 fatty acids may help protect vision ; in fact , the first findings pointing in this direction are more than a decade old			0
but experts not involved in the research agree that the new studies are well done and rigorous			0
" the studies are notable for that alone , " says @entity35 , a staff scientist with the @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38 , who published 12 years of follow - up data on omega - 3 fatty acids and @entity24 risk earlier this year with very similar results			1
" it 's sort of consoling to see that we have this convergence of findings coming from different continents , " he says , noting that researchers from @entity47 and the @entity48 have turned up pretty much the same thing			0
@entity54 : eat right advice : fiber , starch , fats , serving sizes @entity24 is the top cause of blindness among people 65 and older living in the developed world			1
it occurs when blood vessels or cells in the macula , the central portion of the retina responsible for central vision and seeing sharp detail , begin to break down			0
in early @entity24 , people have no vision loss or other symptoms , but do have yellow deposits in the retina called drusen			2
some people with early @entity24 ( but not all of them ) will develop late @entity24 , in which a person has larger drusen and a blurred area at the center of their visual field			2
right now , the only confirmed risk factors for the condition are age , genes , and smoking , so scientists are hoping to identify things that people can do to reduce their risk for the condition			1
and it 's looking more and more like eating the right kinds of fats is one of them			0
in a group of 2,454 men and women followed for up to a decade , dr. @entity95 and colleagues from the @entity97 found people who ate a serving of fish every week were 31 percent less likely to develop early @entity24 than those who did not			1
a couple of servings of nuts each week reduced risk by 35 percent			0
and @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , of the @entity113 and colleagues , in their study of more than 6,700 58 - to 69 - year - olds , found those who consumed the most omega - 3 fatty acids were at 15 percent lower risk of early - stage @entity24			1
people who ate the most olive oil ( at least 100 milliliters , or about seven tablespoons , per week ) were about half as likely to develop late @entity24 as those who consumed less than 1 ml per week			1
@entity54 : can olive oil fix your split ends ? dr. @entity123 and her team also found people who ate the most trans fat were 1.76 times more likely to develop late @entity24 during the study 's follow - up period			1
trans fat , a type of fat often found in commercial baked goods and fried foods , is known to boost ldl or " bad " cholesterol			2
@entity54 : everyday diet strategies to lower ldl or " bad " cholesterol it makes sense that omega - 3s would be helpful in saving your eyesight , says @entity144 , @entity112 , a research scientist at the @entity145 and @entity146 in the @entity147 and @entity148 at @entity149 in @entity150 , @entity151			0
nervous tissue and the retinas contain high levels of omega - 3 fatty acids , especially one known as @entity157 ( docosahexaenoic acid , a particularly beneficial @entity152 ) , she says			0
according to @entity35 , healthy fats likely guard against @entity24 by fighting inflammation			1
to date , all studies of dietary fat and @entity24 have been observational , meaning researchers have looked at what people eat and checked their vision over time			1
@entity35 is running a clinical trial -- @entity168 2 , in which people have been assigned to take omega - 3 fatty acids ( and / or two pigments found in the retina called lutein and zeaxanthin ) or a placebo -- the gold standard for determining cause and effect			0
he says he 's hesitant to make nutritional recommendations until the results are published , which he expects will happen about four years from now			0
but @entity144 points out that the nutritional recommendations revealed by the current study -- including eating a healthy balance of @entity185 fatty acids in relation to omega - 3s -- can easily be accomplished by following the @entity190 " @entity192 " diet @entity191 : myths and facts about cholesterol " i recommend to my patients that they consume a diet rich in omega - 3 fatty acids and fish , especially salmon , sardines and mackerel , as well as nuts and green , leafy vegetables , " says @entity196 , @entity111 , of the @entity197 and @entity198			2
" those not able to consume these foods should consider taking supplements containing fish oil or lutein			0
" @entity196 and her colleagues first reported findings linking omega - 3 fatty acids and fish intake to lower @entity24 risk in 1994			2
