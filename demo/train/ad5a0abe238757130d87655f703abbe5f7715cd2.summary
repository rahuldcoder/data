-- federal investigators have cleared controversial @entity4 sheriff @entity3 's office of criminal wrongdoing regarding allegations of financial improprieties			1
the @entity8 in @entity4 declined to file charges against the @entity11 sheriff 's office after an investigation into claims of abuse of county credit cards , misuse of funds and other financial matters			1
the investigation is separate from a federal civil rights lawsuit accusing @entity3 's office of racial profiling			1
the federal financial probe stems from a 2010 request from @entity11 officials for help in investigating the claims of misuse of county funds			2
federal authorities acted as " special deputy county attorneys " tasked with finding possible state charges			2
last year , federal investigators declined to press charges on several of the allegations			1
in a letter to the @entity11 officials friday , the @entity8 announced it will not initiate charges on two remaining claims			0
" i am very happy with that , " @entity3 said at a news conference			2
federal investigators " cleared my office of any abuse of power or wrongdoing that has been going on for years , and publicized almost every week for three years by the news media and critics , " he said			1
@entity3 faces civil trial in alleged targeting of @entity49 @entity3 , who calls himself " @entity51 's toughest sheriff , " has long been a controversial figure for his tough , proactive stance against illegal immigration			1
but critics say his methods have created a system of racial profiling			1
the sheriff is on trial stemming from a 2007 class - action lawsuit that alleges that his office " launched a series of massive so - called ' crime suppression sweeps ' that show a law enforcement agency operating well beyond the bounds of the law			0
" the @entity69 has also filed a separate civil rights lawsuit against him			0
but the allegations that were dismissed by the federal investigators were of a smaller scale			1
one of the allegations was that the sheriff 's office misused county credit cards			0
the feds found that the office was not properly documenting credit card transactions , but found no evidence of stealing county funds			0
another allegation was that the sheriff 's office used funds earmarked for a program to pay the salaries of officers working on other projects			0
investigators concluded that while the funds indeed where shifted from one law enforcement program to another , there was no " criminal intent			0
" critics of @entity3 were displeased with the decision not to press charges , saying the sheriff clearly abused his power			1
" it is a miscarriage of justice , " @entity99 , director of the @entity100 said in a statement			0
@entity3 said that if he had done something wrong , the federal government would n't have hesitated to bring indictments			2
" i know my people do the right thing , they have a tough job , and because i 'm a high - profile guy , sometimes there 's more interest given to what we do , " he said			0
who stands with @entity3 ?			0
