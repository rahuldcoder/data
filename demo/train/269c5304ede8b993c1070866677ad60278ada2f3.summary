-- making it to the top in one of the toughest and most fickle industries in the world , that of fashion design , requires a careful balance of knowing your own essence and giving the public what they expect			2
that 's according to @entity15 's artistic director @entity14 , who claims one of the greatest challenges of being a designer is staying true to oneself while at the same time listening to comments from critics , journalists and clients , without getting pulled off course by them			1
" it 's important to listen to it , but it 's important to still stay yourself , " she says			2
" because as soon as you start losing your essence , you start becoming uninteresting			0
and i think that 's what 's the biggest challenge			2

she began her career at @entity43 § ot in @entity44 , then took up an internship at @entity46 , before joining @entity47 , helping her establish her private line @entity50 , followed by a few seasons at @entity52			1
@entity14 , who has just shown her debut spring / summer 2013 collection for @entity15 at @entity54 , was born in @entity55 to a @entity55 father and a @entity58 mother and at the age of three moved to @entity60			1
she spent her childhood traveling widely across @entity62 before settling in @entity44			1
she sees herself as a mix of her @entity55 side , the designer who thinks about utility and shape and her @entity62 side , which is more instinctive and into meshing together textures and colors			1
the biggest reward , she says , is creating a collection that persists after the fashion show and seeing that people really want to wear the clothes and the garments do not live on the rack			1

on her childhood interest in fashion ... when i was a child i was always very interested in images , in materials and textures			2
i just tended to put them in a bag that i would always carry with me , and i would stitch them together or , like , staple them together and make sort of fabrics out of them			0
i felt that since my childhood i 've always loved doing this , and it 's what i do naturally -- i mean , i do n't need to make an effort to do it			0
on the influence of living in @entity62 ...			0
i traveled a lot so i would just soak in a lot of feelings , a lot of colors ... and i 've always been somebody who likes to record things , so i would ... start taking pictures and making drawings , or taking leaflets and pamphlets and postcards , fabrics , things everywhere and just collect them			0
it was also i guess my cultural background which is quite rich			0
i think that it 's that sensibility to color also , to materials mostly that people always saw in me			0
on studying at @entity43 § ot ... you have to know where you 're going and what it is that attracts you to be there , to survive in a school like that			0
they expect collections from you , but no one tells you what to be inspired by ... it forces you to follow your own path , which i feel is the only key to being a good fashion designer			1
on being appointed artistic director of women 's ready - to - wear at @entity145 ... i have to represent a company , a fashion house that is historic ... that 's always attached to the ' 60s , and now the biggest challenge is to bring it forward to our times			1
this is not a fashion house that 's purely about style , but mostly about handwork and craftsmanship , and texture and material			2
on her debut collection for @entity15 ... nowadays women want things that are ... more functional but at the same time we 've such an affluence of clothes and brands that are very wearable , that we also are looking for things that are very precise and very special , like sort of extraordinary pieces			1
it 's also important to balance for me in this collection , the wearable side with the extraordinary piece side			2
so i , i basically wanted to do something a little bit psychedelic , something that is a little bit ' 60s but in a ... magic way			0
on where she gets inspiration ... we can have our phone and take photos with our @entity185 anytime , any place			0
i travel and i love to bring things back ... even just books or even a shell			0
on the real purpose of a fashion designer ... in the end , what you 're doing is not just supposed to be living for one fashion show , and then you pack it and put it in the archives			1
it 's about giving your creations an afterlife			0
giving them the possibility to go out on the street , or to be worn by a celebrity for a show , for a premiere or for any kind of event .			0
