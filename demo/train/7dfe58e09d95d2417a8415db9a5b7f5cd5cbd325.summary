-- for @entity3 's @entity2 , the present no longer means reveling in the fleet - footed legends of past stage glories			1
instead , the focus is on creating a program as international and challenging as that of any major company on the planet			0
the country 's national ballet has been up and running since april 2009 ( when it was given artistic autonomy within the existing structures of the @entity16 " @entity15 " in @entity17 ) , pushing out exciting new works and stage shows to wide acclaim			0

" for everyone in @entity3 , not only for ballet dancers but also in other jobs , you know one has to be innovative , creative , " pastor explained			1
" that 's the importance of art. we should be sort of avant - garde ( with ) this creativity and innovation , " he added			0
representing modern @entity3 pastor 's mission is to create a dance company that reflects @entity3 's rebirth after a turbulent century of wars , occupations and repression			1
according to the @entity16 , ballet has played a prominent role in @entity3 culture since as far back as the 16th century when the first choreographed displays began appearing in the country 's royal courts			2

" attracting international talent with scores of dancers and productions , the complex artistic operation is far from a one - man - show			0
but according to prima ballerina @entity94 the potential of this dance company could only have been fulfilled with @entity31 's homecoming			2
