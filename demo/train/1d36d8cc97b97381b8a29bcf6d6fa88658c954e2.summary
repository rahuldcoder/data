-- it 's sometimes said that the ' 00s opened with a @entity3 and ended with a @entity4			1
yet this dramatic decade still lacks even a name			1
the @entity6 had big bands and a bigger war , the @entity10 protests and hippies , the @entity12 " malaise			2
" but what do we call the decade just ending ? the @entity16 ? the late @entity17 suggested the @entity18 , " nought " being an old - fashioned term for " zero " ( as in dough - nought )			1
whatever you call them , the years from 2000 on have been united by one great theme : this is the decade when the bills came due for neglected problems			1
1 ) terrorism the most painful thought about the 9/11 attack was how easily it could have been prevented			1
if the state trooper who pulled over @entity31 for speeding had a way to detect a fraudulent driver 's license -- if the gate agent who checked @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 , had acted on his suspicions -- if , if , if			1
through the 1990s , the @entity39 was targeted by an escalating series of terrorist actions			2
yet the country 's leaders continued to treat terrorism as second or third - tier problem			1
president @entity46 did not respond to the attack on the @entity48 in december 2000			2
some suspected he feared retaliation would disrupt his @entity53 - @entity52 peace negotiations			2
candidate @entity54 promised @entity56 voters that he would end the use of @entity59 terrorism evidence in immigration hearings			1
the bill for past laxity came due on september 11 , 2001			2
and over the remainder of the decade , other bills would arrive : the bill for allowing @entity70 to remain in power in 1991 , the bill for not responding to @entity65 - sponsored terrorist attacks in the 1990s			1
after the attack on the @entity39 @entity75 barracks in @entity76 killed 19 , the @entity46 administration threatened retaliation if @entity65 repeated the atrocity			2
that threat was followed by the ramping up of the @entity65 nuclear program that confronts the world today			2
2 ) health care the private marketplace had developed a promising , cost - efficient means of delivering healthcare : the health maintenance organization			1
thanks to the spread of @entity91 , health care costs grew more slowly in the 1990s than any decade since @entity92 because health care costs are paid out of employee wages , slowing those costs boosted worker pay			1
thanks in large part to the slowdown of health cost inflation , worker incomes grew faster in the 1990s than in any decade since the 1960s			1
but the @entity91 had their faults and kinks			2
instead of defending and improving the @entity91 system , demagogic state and federal politicians waged war on @entity91 , imposing strict mandates on them that forced up their costs			0
and they persuaded employers to revert to more traditional and expensive fee - for - service medicine			0
the main result : costs exploded upward again in the 2000s			0
the average cost of a health policy for a family of four doubled between 2000 and 2006 , from about $ 6,000 to about $ 13,000			1
a secondary result : wage growth stopped			0
the typical earner actually brought home less after inflation in 2006 than in 2000			1
3 ) immigration in 1986 , @entity124 passed the @entity126 bill , granting amnesty to illegal aliens and promising stricter enforcement of immigration laws in the future			1
the amnesty only invited a huge surge of migrants hoping for a second amnesty			0
the promised enforcement never materialized			0
over the ensuing decade , the @entity39 received the biggest influx of migration since before the @entity139			1
these new migrants transformed the lives of middle - class @entity39			0
in the 1960s , @entity143 's was the typical night out for a middle - income family			1
in the 1990s , a family earning the same income could enjoy table service at an @entity149 or @entity150 's			2
@entity152 cleaning , gardening , nannying and valet parking all became more affordable to middle - class @entity39			0
there were losers from this social transformation : lower - skilled natives priced out of low - wage jobs			0
but they had little political clout , and their feelings were easily ignored			0
but in the 2000s , it became apparent that the illegal migrant population had grown vastly bigger			0
migrants were now displacing the native - born from more desirable work : construction , meatpacking , trucking			0
more ominously , the children of the migrants were growing into something that looked very much like an underclass			0
the rate of teen motherhood among second - generation @entity179 children is higher than among blacks			0
barely half of second - generation @entity179 migrants complete high school on time			0
rejecting the low - skilled jobs that employed their parents , but unprepared for more skilled work , they fall into gangs and alienation			0
and this time , unlike 1986 , we are talking about a population numbering in the tens of millions			0
these bills for past mistakes arrived in the 2000s			0
but we did not manage to pay them			0
maybe it would be both more numerically and historically accurate to call the decade not the double zeroes but the triple zeroes			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			1

the decade that 's ending does **n't** yet have a name
@entity203 says the decade was marked by *unsolved* issues of earlier years
@entity211 : terrorism , health care inflation , immigration issues came home to roost
he says these problems have **n't** been solved in this decade either
