the pilot of a plane that crashed near @entity2 , @entity3 , in 2009 , killing 50 people , was in the cockpit despite earlier concerns by airline officials regarding his ability to fly that type of plane , according to e-mails released by attorneys representing crash victims ' families in lawsuits			1
@entity16 , operated by @entity17 , crashed february 12 , 2009 , in @entity18 , @entity3 , about five miles short of its destination , the @entity20			1
the @entity21 blamed pilot error for the crash nearly a year later , saying that the pilot , capt. @entity24 , pulled on the @entity26 's control column when he should have pushed			2
e-mails obtained by @entity27 sunday from attorneys representing victims ' families , meanwhile , show @entity17 in august 2008 decided not to include @entity24 among those upgrading to fly the @entity26			1
@entity24 " had a problem upgrading , " chief pilot @entity31 wrote in the e-mails			1
" anyone that does not meet the ( minimum requirements ) and had problems in training before is not ready to tackle the @entity41 , " @entity34 , @entity35 's vice-president of operations , responded			1
@entity42 , @entity17 's parent company , said in a statement sunday that at the time @entity24 requested to transition from the smaller @entity45 aircraft to the @entity26 in august 2008 , he had passed three checking tests , known as " checking events			1
" " however , @entity35 's chief pilot required that captain @entity24 successfully pass another proficiency check before being allowed to begin transition training , " said @entity42 spokesman @entity48			1
" on september 26 , 2008 , captain @entity24 successfully completed a proficiency line check flight and was subsequently entered in the october 2008 @entity26 transition class			1
" he successfully completed the training program and transition operating experience in the @entity26 , @entity48 said			1
@entity35 did not include the information regarding the e-mails as part of @entity24 's employment file , according to an accompanying letter from @entity62 , who represents victims ' families , adding the documents are " central to the issues in this case			2
" in their lawsuits , the victims ' families claim include that @entity35 , @entity42 and @entity70 failed to provide trained and capable pilots and also failed to ensure the pilots were rested and able to perform their duties			0
after its investigation of the crash , the @entity21 said neither @entity24 nor the first officer , @entity76 , realized the plane was slowing down too quickly , and did not react properly when the " stick shaker " -- a vibrating column which indicates the plane is entering a stall -- activated , the @entity21 said			2
@entity24 , according to the board , reacted " consistent with startle and confusion " and pulled on the column , exacerbating the situation and dooming the aircraft			0
the board agreed that both @entity24 and @entity89 were fatigued , but disagreed about whether that fatigue contributed to the crash , eventually voting 2 - 1 not to include it as a contributing factor			0
@entity21 chairman @entity93 said last year it it was " disturbing to hear of the numerous times " @entity24 failed proficiency tests			1
after the crash , it was revealed that @entity24 had failed three pilot tests , known as " check - rides , " before joining @entity17 , but had disclosed only one on job applications			1
he failed two more while at @entity17 , officials said			0
in august 2009 , @entity104 , president and ceo of @entity42 , the parent company of @entity17 , testified at a @entity107 hearing that while " a failure on a check - ride is not necessarily a reason for someone not to fly , it depends on what kind of failure it is			2
" " the failures that we were unable to see were the basic fundamental failures that you would not want to have , " @entity104 said			0
" let me stress one thing : capt. @entity24 was a fine man by all accounts , " he said			0
" but " had we known what we know now , no , he would not have been in that ( pilot 's ) seat			2
" allegations that @entity35 withheld the information from the @entity21 " or anyone else , is completely false , " @entity48 said			0
" @entity35 voluntarily informed the @entity21 that it required captain @entity24 to successfully complete a proficiency check prior to being allowed to begin transition training for the @entity26			1
" the e-mails were provided to plaintiffs in the lawsuits three months ago , @entity48 said			0
the documents were classified as confidential , and @entity35 agreed to a plaintiffs ' request to reconsider " because we remain confident in our full compliance with @entity140 regulations governing our training processes , then and now , " @entity48 said			0
" this was the first time in the litigation that ( plaintiffs ) requested a ' confidential ' document be de-designated , " he said. , " however , we have serious concerns that plaintiffs may attempt to continue to attempt to try this case in the media , which could impact @entity35 's ability to receive a fair trial in @entity2			2
" at the time of the crash , @entity24 had 3,379 hours of flight experience , 172 hours in the @entity26			0
@entity48 noted he was @entity154 rated -- " the highest level of certification available " -- and was in accordance with all @entity140 regulations			0
he had more than 100 hours as pilot - in - command of a @entity26 , the statement said			0
the @entity21 issued more than 20 recommendations after the crash .			0
