-- i peered over the shoulder of the flight engineer and studied the pressurization gauge on his panel			1
the needle indicated that the cabin was climbing , and the slow popping in my ears confirmed it			1
the flight engineer swiveled his seat away from the panel and turned in my direction , brow furrowed , eyes wide			1
" should i tell the captain ? " he asked			1
the question seemed foolish , but i understood			2
the flight engineer was brand new , having completed his training with the airline a week earlier			1
i was a seasoned veteran of six months , observing from the jump seat for the purpose of monitoring co-pilot procedures			2
i had just upgraded from the flight engineer position to a " window seat " on the 727			1
" yes , " i replied with raised eyebrows			2
" i would tell the captain ... like right now			1
" the captain had already begun to swivel in his seat			1
he squinted at the array of switches and indications on the panel			2
a conference with the flight engineer ensued			1
all four of us in the cockpit focused momentarily on the cabin rate needle			1
it was still indicating a climb			2
for some mysterious reason , we were slowly losing cabin pressurization			1
the captain turned toward me in a silent gesture to obtain confirmation			1
without hesitation , he instructed the co-pilot to request an immediate descent to 10,000 feet from our altitude of 37,000 feet			1
i reached for the oxygen mask and strapped it to my face			2
the rest of the crew followed my lead			2
ten minutes later , and after the completion of the appropriate emergency checklist , we reached 10,000 feet			0
our 152 passengers had to endure a lack of air conditioning because of the pressurization problem , but other than that , the experience was a non-event			0
this should have been the same outcome for the single - engine @entity73 turboprop that crashed , tragically , in the waters off @entity76 on friday			1
the @entity73 had departed @entity77 , @entity78 , bound for @entity79 , @entity80 , with two occupants on board : @entity83 , the pilot / owner and his wife , @entity84			1
but the pilot became unresponsive while the airplane cruised at 25,000 feet over @entity87			1
instead of landing in @entity79 , the autopilot system allowed the turboprop to continue flying off the eastern @entity92 coastline , crossing over @entity93 before , with its fuel supply exhausted , it crashed into the sea about 12 miles north of the @entity76 coastline			1
two @entity92 - launched f - 15s confirmed through observation that the pilot appeared unconscious			1
the @entity99 - made @entity73 is a sophisticated piece of technology , far superior to the old @entity102 airliner i described above			0
it is a great representative of the new generation in privately - owned cabin class airplanes , competing with traditional twin - engine turboprops and even small , corporate jets			1
composite material , finely tuned aeroengineering design , a reliable and proven @entity112 engine and advanced cockpit displays and controls all combine to make the $ 3.7 million airplane a respected machine			0
more than 1,000 of these airplanes are operating today ; the 900 is the most recent version			0
according to an @entity121 and @entity122 ( @entity123 ) report , this was the third @entity73 owned by @entity83 ; he had logged 5,000 hours in the model			0
one would think that such experience would have produced a positive result and not a crash into the ocean			0
what happened exactly ? @entity131 , lack of oxygen to the brain , would appear to be the most likely culprit			0
depending upon the health condition of an individual , the time of useful consciousness at 25,000 feet is n't much more than about a minute			0
but that 's if a depressurization occurs as a catastrophic event with some type of major hole in the fuselage , allowing air to escape explosively			0
but in this instance , judging by 30 minutes of @entity149 audio recording , it was not a catastrophic occurrence , but rather a slow event			0
news reports say the pilot asked to descend to 18,000 feet because " we have an indication that is not correct in the plane , " according to a stream of that transmission posted on liveatc.net			1
after about one minute , the airplane was cleared initially from 28,000 feet to 25,000 feet where it eventually remained until fuel exhaustion			0
while descending , @entity149 gave further clearance to 20,000 feet but the pilot responded with an unintelligible transmission			1
it 's possible he was already suffering from hypoxia			2
a slow loss of oxygen to the brain is insidious ; most people not familiar with the symptoms do n't recognize the danger			2
a depressurization problem is a traumatic event that it is easily managed -- but only if the problem is recognized			0
like the captain of the 727 , a pilot facing such a situation would have to don an oxygen mask the minute he suspected the issue			1
the next objective would be to descend the airplane to a habitable altitude -- 10,000 feet is a typical procedure goal			2
for this to occur , a sense of urgency has to be stated or an emergency declared			0
apparently , none of this happened			0
at the airline level , we train for such a depressurization event from day one			0
it is an emergency that is etched into our muscle memory			0
i am certain this emergency was part of the training for this particular @entity73 pilot			2
whether it was part of his muscle memory , we ca n't know			0
the airplane is equipped with an emergency oxygen bottle attached to quick - donning masks for just such circumstances			0
it is possible that the system may have malfunctioned			0
perhaps a closed valve not noticed on the preflight inspection ? an undetected leak ? or maybe the system that had been causing the malfunction released the cabin pressurization in one final event			2
regardless , if indeed a pressurization malfunction had been observed , the prudent decision would have been to descend immediately and head off a tragedy			0
sad as this outcome was , we can be thankful for small favors			0
the airplane 's sophisticated automation system steered it away from populated areas and a tragedy of even greater proportions .			0

early in pilot *career* , @entity230 faced rapid loss of cabin pressure
he says captain of *doomed* flight that crashed in @entity76 waters may have faced that , too
if so , hypoxia would have kept him from making *lifesaving* altitude *adjustments* , he says
