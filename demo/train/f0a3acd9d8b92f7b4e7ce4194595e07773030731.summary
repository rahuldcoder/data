they 'd just finished their middle school exams and were heading home to @entity3 , @entity4			1
but rather than relief and celebration , scores of @entity4 @entity7 children say they endured torture and humiliation -- at the hands of @entity13			1
@entity14 , an international advocacy organization , reported the allegations tuesday based on interviews with four boys who said they were held by the @entity19 extremist group for months			2
while @entity21 could not independently verify the claims , there certainly is precedent			0
international authorities , witnesses and people in the middle of yearslong strife in @entity4 and @entity29 have accused @entity13 of many misdeeds and war crimes in the past , including enslaving young women and children			1
every story is hard to take , and those documented by @entity14 are no exception			0
@entity38 women sold , raped , enslaved by @entity13 the boys , ages 14 to 16 , said they were part of a group making the roughly 150 - kilometer ( 100 - mile ) trek back from @entity42 from exams when @entity13 militants halted and detained them on may 29			1
@entity13 let approximately 100 girls go within hours , but they kept the boys at a school in @entity49 , some 50 kilometers southwest of @entity3 , according to the @entity14 report			1
their living conditions there were sparse : sleeping with blankets on the floor , bathing once every two weeks , eating twice a day and getting occasional visits and calls from their parents			0
and it got much worse from there			0
the interviewed boys talked about being forced to watch videos of @entity13 beheadings and attacks , pray five times daily and memorize parts of the @entity65			1
if they did not do well enough on their religious lessons , if they tried to escape , if they did anything that was construed as misbehaving -- or even if they did not -- the young captives could be beaten with hoses and electrical cables , according to the @entity14 report			1
the advocacy group said one child was tied up with his hands tied behind his back and one hand tied to his foot after calling out for his mother			2
" they sometimes beat us for no reason , " a 16 - year - old boy said			0
a 15 - year - old boy said that the detained children who had relatives in the @entity7 militia known the @entity88 , or @entity88 , were treated the worst			0
@entity88 members were seen as nonbelievers in @entity13 ' extreme brand of @entity92 , thus making them second - class citizens at best and mortal enemies at worst			2
" they ( @entity13 ) told them to give them the addresses of their families , cousins , uncles , saying , ' when we go to @entity3 , we will get them and cut them up , ' " the boy said			0
some of the boys escaped , were released or were swapped for captive @entity13 fighters between june and september			2
the terrorist group released about 75 boys -- including the four interviewed , who have since made their way across the border to @entity108 -- in late september , with the equivalent of a @entity111 dollar and a dvd featuring religious material			2
