-- " make us dream " read the message			0
as the @entity5 supporters danced and sang at the @entity6 , the nightmare continued for @entity8 manager @entity7			1
a crushing 3 - 0 victory over @entity8 was the least @entity11 ' side deserved as it outclassed and outfought an insipid and pitiful @entity8			1
two goals from @entity13 , both from the penalty spot and a @entity16 strike , condemned @entity8 to defeat and gave yet more credence that @entity5 is a serious title contender			1
@entity5 , which sits four points behind leader @entity20 with a game in hand , was a class apart on an afternoon where @entity8 's deficiencies were laid bare for all to see			1
" it 's a fantastic day personally but we came here to win the game , " @entity13 told @entity27			1
" we 'll enjoy tonight but we need to move on quickly			0
we 've shown today we 're genuine contenders and we 'll fight to the end			0
" we played a diamond today and totally bossed the midfield and controlled the game			0
the @entity8 defense will not have had a harder game than against our strikers today			2
" we believe that we can win the league			0
but the easiest thing in football is to talk the talk			0
we have to treat @entity42 and @entity43 the same as @entity8			2
i maybe got a bit cocky with the last penalty but scored the two that mattered most			2
" last season , @entity8 finished 28 points clear of @entity5 on its way to winning the @entity53 title			1
now , @entity7 ' side is 14 points behind and faces the embarrassment of not even managing to qualify for @entity58 football			0
on wednesday , @entity8 meets @entity60 side @entity59 in the second leg of its last 16 @entity63 tie needing to overturn a two - goal deficit to progress			1
failure would represent another disastrous episode in @entity7 ' reign since replacing @entity68 at the end of last season			0
worse for @entity8 is the success of its greatest rival - @entity5			1
a fifth successive league victory was recorded with consummate ease as @entity8 's lack of cohesion afforded the likes of @entity16 and strike partner @entity76 more room than they could ever have imagined			1
@entity5 dominated the opening 45 minutes and went ahead when @entity80 , already on a yellow card , handled inside the penalty area			1
@entity80 , fortunate not to be sent off , then watched on as @entity13 expertly placed the ball into the corner			2
united , with @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , all on the field , struggled to make any real impact			0
its only real opportunity of the first half came when @entity85 's fierce effort was tipped away by @entity95 in the @entity5 goal			2
quite what @entity7 said to his players at halftime was unclear but he almost certainly not have expected what was to follow			0
just 24 second had elapsed when @entity101 clumsily bundled over @entity102 in the @entity8 penalty area and @entity13 swept home the spot kick			1
@entity8 tried to respond and was unfortunate to be awarded a penalty when @entity107 appeared to handle			1
@entity108 sent a header wide of the post as the home side attempted to gain a foothold in the game			0
but any hope of a comeback should have been extinguished with 12 minutes to go when @entity116 was adjudged to have fouled @entity76 in the penalty area			0
@entity116 was shown a second yellow card and promptly dismissed but @entity13 could only hit the post on this occasion			2
there was still time for @entity5 to appeal for a fourth penalty when @entity123 looked to have tripped @entity76 but referee @entity124 waved away the appeals			1
@entity16 should have added a third after outpacing the @entity8 defense but @entity127 produced a sublime save to deny the @entity5 striker			1
but the @entity129 did n't make the same mistake minutes later			0
@entity76 attempted a shot from the edge of the penalty area and when the ball was deflected into @entity16 's path , the forward coolly slotted the ball home			1
the third and final goal sparked yet more jubilant scenes in the away section			0
" we 're going to win the league , " sang the @entity5 supporters			2
those chants may be premature but with @entity20 and @entity145 both still to visit @entity146 , anything is possible			0
" make us dream " read the banner -- those dreams could yet come true			0
gunners in the day 's other game , @entity150 defeated north @entity153 rival @entity152 at @entity154			1
@entity155 scored the only goal of the game after just 72 seconds			0
the victory moves @entity150 to within four points of leader @entity20 with a game in hand .			2

@entity13 scored twice from the penalty spot
@entity13 missed a third penalty before @entity16 scored
