-- @entity1 burst onto the public markets last month , quickly earning itself a valuation of $ 1.5 billion -- and a tidy payday for its chief investors and founders			1
but it 's possible they got into the market just before the getting stopped being good			0
there 's a rising backlash against " spam " search results and other low - quality content , and that could spell the death knell for content farms like demand			1
the problem : @entity20 used to be an efficient way to find what you needed			2
enter a search term , and , presto , the results served up the very thing you were looking for			2
but increasingly , that 's not the case			0
investor and business commentator @entity30 recently vented his outrage at the pile of garbage he found on @entity20 when he went looking for tips on buying a dishwasher			1
@entity38 professor ( and tech commentator ) @entity37 threw up his hands when @entity20 could n't help his students find the information they were looking for			2
and at a panel on the future of search earlier this week , @entity44 co-founder @entity43 said : " three times in the last month , i searched for things on @entity20 , and the result was n't on the front page			1
that 's the first time it 's ever happened			0
" a major source of the problem is the entire industry that has emerged to game the @entity20 system , producing content that looks promising within the results , but that when clicked on , serves up a mishmash of text that looks like sneezed - out alphabet soup			1
the material produced by @entity1 -- and other content farms , like @entity66 -- is usually not as egregious as the example above , but it 's often not far behind			1
demand and @entity66 both employ humans , but make thousands of assignments a month -- and there are minimum quality requirements			2
the payment structure at both companies is such that very few freelancers can afford to devote the time necessary to produce the kind of reliable take a reader might be looking for			0
for example , a @entity80 story about @entity68 described the efforts of a videographer to shoot , edit , and post 10 videos on kayaking techniques in under two hours , because he was only getting paid a total of $ 200			0
search engines , whose entire value proposition rests on the quality of the results they produce , are starting to take notice			1
blekko , a new engine launched last year to fight this very problem , is already crowdsourcing quality by letting users mark results as spam			1
earlier this week , @entity100 announced that , based on feedback it received through its spam - watch program , it had decided to ban material from 20 sites produced by content farms , like @entity1 's @entity107			1
the sites " are literally responsible for millions of pages on the web that our users say are just not helpful and they 'd prefer they were banned permanently , " @entity100 ceo @entity108 said			2
" so we 're going to do that for them			0
" @entity20 has also responded			2
" in 2010 , we launched two major algorithmic changes focused on low - quality sites , " @entity117 , @entity20 's leader for search quality , wrote on the @entity119 last month			1
" nonetheless , we hear the feedback from the web loud and clear : people are asking for even stronger action on content farms and sites that consist primarily of spammy or low - quality content			1
... we can and should do better			0
" what @entity20 will actually do remains to be seen			2
at @entity132 this week , the conference at which @entity44 's @entity43 appeared , @entity117 indicated that the search giant is looking for algorithmic ways to improve the quality of search results			1
" we care about the long - term loyalty of our users , " he said			0
all of which means , if the search business gets serious about weeding out spam and low - quality content , demand 's days could be numbered			1
its business model was designed to exploit -- and reap revenue from -- the specific ecosystem into which it was born			0
but if that ecosystem changes , it 's anyone 's guess whether @entity68 will be able to retool and find a new strategy			0
the " @entity155 " section of its pre-ipo s - 1 filing says as much : " internet search engines could decide that content on our owned and operated websites and on our customers ' websites , including content that is created by our freelance content creators , is unacceptable , " the filing says			1
" any reduction in the number of users directed to our owned and operated websites and to our customers ' websites would negatively affect our ability to earn revenue			0
if traffic on our owned and operated websites and on our customers ' websites declines , we may need to resort to more costly sources to replace lost traffic , and such increased expense could adversely affect our business , revenue , financial condition and results of operations			0
" @entity0 reached out to demand for comment , but they declined because they are still in the " quiet period " required by the @entity184 , which prohibits companies from talking about themselves in the period surrounding an ipo			0

@entity1 was recently valued at $ 1.5 billion at its *initial* public *offering*
but a search - engine *crackdown* could spell trouble for content farms like demand
@entity20 's @entity117 says the search giant plans to crack down on low - quality content
@entity100 , a startup search engine , already bans results from @entity1
