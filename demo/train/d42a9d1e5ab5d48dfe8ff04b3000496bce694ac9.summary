@entity0 , @entity1 -- when i think back on this past week and the rollercoaster of emotions i have experienced at the @entity6 , i realize that everything happens for a reason			2
hours before the @entity10 opening ceremonies i learned that my appeal to overturn my reclassification had been denied			2
in that moment i felt defeat			2
i felt as though everything i had worked for the past four and a half years had been stripped from me , but it was then that i realized that the journey to get to this point was n't about the medals			1
the reason why i got back in the water in april 2008 nearly four months after being paralyzed , the reason that i devoted my life to swimming for the past four years , the sacrifices i made , and the person i became , was n't about the medals			1
i think it was easy for me to get lost in the numbers -- the number of how many golds i could win -- but when this happened it forced me to reflect on my journey and what got me to this point			1
i realized i did all of that to become the best possible swimmer , athlete and person i could be for this very moment , medals or no medals			1

no matter what happens and what has happened , that is something that ca n't be taken away from me			2
that is something that no - one can strip from me			1
the work that i have put into this , the passion that backs it , and who i have become throughout this journey all remains the same no matter what classification i am			1

i sat in the ready room as a t10 complete paraplegic , no function from my belly button down , and i was up against girls who are single - arm amputees			1
i sat there and watched them stretch their legs as i stretched my arms and i knew that it would be an uphill battle , but i also knew that nothing is impossible			0
as i got out to the blocks , everything from that point on became a blur up until the point when i hit the wall and turned to see my face on the big screen			0
