-- a small group of observers resumed the @entity4 ' mission to monitor a truce in @entity6 that was tenuous from the start and showed signs wednesday of unraveling as opposition activists again reported widespread violence			1
in what appeared to be a pattern of retaliation , security forces were accused of attacking a number of hot spots , including the cities of @entity18 and @entity19 , after @entity4 monitors had left the areas			1
security forces have also reportedly targeted residents who have spoken to the monitors , according to @entity24 , spokesman for special envoy @entity25			0
@entity24 told the @entity26 that people have been harassed and even killed for speaking with the monitors			0
one activist in @entity19 urged the monitors to return to the besieged city to see what was unfolding in the wake of their departure			1
" the security forces have continued their siege on @entity19 for the second day today , " said @entity36 , identified only by his first name for safety reasons			1
" we desperately call on the international monitors to return to @entity19 to see the other face of the regime , " he said			1
in remarks to the @entity26 on tuesday , @entity25 criticized reports of actions forces loyal to president @entity48			0
" i am particularly alarmed by reports that government troops entered @entity18 ( monday ) after observers departed , firing automatic weapons and killing a significant number of people , " @entity25 said			1
" if confirmed , this is totally unacceptable and reprehensible			0
" @entity56 erupted again nationwide wednesday			0
at least 100 people were killed , including 70 in @entity18 , 16 of whom were children , said the opposition @entity61			1
the reported violence in the southern city of @entity18 occurred two days after a visit to the city by @entity4 observers			1
an activist in @entity18 told @entity0 that at least 56 people were killed in the shelling of the city 's @entity71 neighborhood on wednesday			1
the activist said that the @entity6 military began shelling the neighborhood at noon ( 5 a.m. et ) , causing a number of houses to collapse , killing those inside			1
the @entity61 said residents were still pulling bodies from the rubble late in the evening			0
@entity0 can not independently verify reports of violence and deaths within @entity6 , as the government has restricted access by international media			1
a handful of @entity4 observers have in recent days toured restive cities and towns after @entity25 , the joint @entity4 - @entity91 envoy , brokered a six - point peace plan with @entity48			1
@entity25 said @entity6 's foreign minister told him that heavy weapons and troops had been withdrawn from population centers and that military operations had ended , key elements of the peace plan			2
@entity25 described the communication as " encouraging , " but added , " the only promises that count are the promises that are kept			0
" @entity102 sen. @entity101 , @entity103 , told @entity0 that he had little hope for success for the @entity4 mission in @entity6			1
" how atrocious is it that the government allows these monitors in , people have the courage to come out and express their grievances and then they slaughter people , " he said			0
" if it was n't so serious , it would be a bad joke			0
" the ongoing carnage , say opposition activists , is proof that @entity48 does not intend to keep his promises			0
at least 38 people were killed across the country tuesday , the @entity61 said			0
the @entity122 said @entity123 , a @entity124 volunteer , was killed and three others were injured in @entity19 on tuesday evening			2
@entity127 was shot and killed in a vehicle clearly marked with the @entity124 emblem , the agency said			0
the @entity26 recently authorized sending up to 300 monitors to @entity6 for 90 days			1
they are tasked with observing a cease - fire that was supposed to have begun april 12			0
by next monday , 30 observers are expected to be on the ground , with that number swelling to 100 by month 's end			2
but as of wednesday , only 13 were in @entity6			2
one problem is that @entity138 is unwilling to allow monitors from any of the 60 - plus nations that are part of the " @entity142 , " a group that aims to find a solution to the crisis			2
the group , which includes the @entity102 , @entity147 and @entity148 , met this month and recognized the opposition @entity149 as a legitimate representative of the @entity6 people			2
analysis : @entity4 mission does nothing to change endgame in @entity6 nationalities aside , some question whether the observers will be able to get an objective , comprehensive view of the situation			1
" they are all the time watched by the security forces of the regime , " said one opposition activist , who is not being identified for safety reasons			0
the observers are also tasked with implementing the peace plan , which calls for the government and the opposition to end the bloodshed , provide access to the population for humanitarian groups , release detainees and start a political dialogue			0
the crisis began in march 2011 , when the government started cracking down on peaceful protesters calling for the ouster of @entity48 , whose family has ruled @entity6 for 42 years			2
the @entity4 estimates at least 9,000 people have since died , while activist groups put the death toll at more than 11,000			2
@entity0 's @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .			0
