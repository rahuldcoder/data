-- over the past weekend , gov. @entity1 of @entity2 took to the safety of @entity4 to reveal that the @entity6 's budget deficit is now $ 15.7 billion , far greater than the original $ 9.2 billion estimate in january			1
@entity2 state taxes , already some of the highest in the nation , brought in an anemic 20 % less revenue than expected in april , causing @entity2 's deficit to nearly double in only four months			1
on monday , @entity1 released a revised budget plan			2
@entity15 ' it may be better known as			0
@entity1 's budget calls for new spending cuts , to which state workers have yet to agree ; even higher taxes , at which voters may balk ; and rosy revenue assumptions , which already came up massively short in april			1
the new deficit strategy relies heavily on higher taxes : raising the state sales tax from 7.25 % to 7.5 % and hiking income taxes on those making more than $ 1 million from 10.3 % to 13.3 % , the highest rate of any state			2
although he calls his plan a " millionaire 's tax , " it would also boost rates on incomes starting at $ 250,000			0
@entity1 's now famous explanation -- " anybody who makes $ 250,000 becomes a millionaire very quickly , if you save " -- illustrates well the calamity that is @entity2 economics today			1
if @entity1 's plan fails , again , he would institute an automatic $ 5.5 billion cut to public and higher education			1
@entity2 's children should n't be punished for the mistakes of adults , nor should its residents be forced to choose between tax hikes and education cuts to try and solve their budget problems			1
@entity2 should look to @entity51			1
gov. @entity52 closed a large budget hole without raising taxes or cutting education but by going straight to one of the roots of the problem -- public employee unions			1
last summer , @entity52 required union members to contribute 5.8 % of their pay toward pensions and 12.6 % of their health insurance premiums , while also reforming collective bargaining agreements for government workers			0
at first glance , @entity52 's reforms appeared to be political suicide			0
but as the returns come in , and schools are n't closing , draconian cuts are n't being made and taxes are n't getting higher			0
@entity52 's success leaves his opponents with little ammunition			0
@entity77 mayor @entity76 , @entity52 's @entity78 opponent in the june recall election , hardly mentions @entity52 's union reforms anymore			0
with @entity52 opening a lead in recent polls , top @entity51 @entity78 are angry that the @entity83 is unwilling to invest heavily to recall him			0
@entity51 recently reported that property tax bills for the median homes fell by 0.4 % in 2011 , the first drop in more 13 years			0
in january , @entity88 reported a $ 100,000 budget surplus thanks to @entity52 's reforms			2
and in @entity91 , school officials say the pension and health care reforms will transform their $ 400,000 budget deficit into a $ 1.5 million surplus			1
in chief executive 's annual survey of the @entity99 , @entity51 jumped from 41st place in 2010 to 24th place in 2011 and bumped up to 20th place in 2012			2
@entity2 , once again ranked dead last , is begging for similar public pension and health reforms			1
@entity2 state teachers are the highest paid teachers in the country , with an average salary of $ 68,000			2
the typical pension plan allows them to retire after 30 years with 75 % of their salary intact			0
it 's no coincidence that the @entity113 has a $ 65 billion unfunded liability			2
@entity1 has introduced pension reform , but it 's been shelved for the past six months			1
@entity117 leader @entity116 and @entity78 leaders have yet to commit to any increase in retirement age or pension contributions			0
until @entity2 addresses comprehensive pension reform , the state will continue to sink deeper into debt			1
even @entity78 in @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 are pushing through pension reform			1
there may eventually be hope for @entity2			0
but , in the words of @entity132 , only after they 've tried everything else			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity136 .			0

gov. @entity1 of @entity2 faces a budget deficit of nearly $ 16 billion
@entity140 : @entity2 should look to @entity51 as role model
he says @entity51 addressed the root of budget problem : public employee unions
@entity136 : pension reform is the *key* to @entity2 's *fiscal* *crisis*
