@entity0 -- president @entity2 faces a long list of issues when he steps to the podium in the @entity6 on friday for a news conference			1
the last time he took questions from reporters was june 30 , during his trip to @entity11			1
since then , the @entity20 has embarked on a campaign - style tour pushing its economic agenda , while unforeseen issues like the recent unprecedented embassy closures because of a terror threat and the strained relationship with @entity16 over @entity18 leaker @entity17 have taken center stage			1
with all those as possible topics for reporters to press the president on -- here are some questions that could come up			1
the administration recently made the decision to close embassies around the world , evacuate diplomatic staff in @entity34 and @entity35 and elevate the terror alert			2
does the fact @entity38 is capable of causing such a reaction contradict your administration 's claim that it has been decimated ? the @entity43 this week closed nearly two dozen embassies and consulates in the @entity46 and @entity11 amid fears of an @entity38 attack			1
many in the diplomatic and intelligence community called the decision , which was sparked by an intercepted message among senior @entity38 operatives , unprecedented			0
in an interview on tuesday on the " @entity55 " with @entity56 , @entity2 called the threat " significant enough that we are taking every precaution			1
" just before @entity60 in 2012 , @entity2 made an impassioned speech in @entity62 , @entity63 , in which he said , " the war in @entity65 is winding down			1
" this latest revelation that a message from @entity38 led to the closures has called the assessment into question			0
@entity20 press secretary @entity71 said the @entity20 stood by that idea this week			1
" it 's leadership decimated and there 's no question it 's on the run , " @entity71 said , drawing a distinction from the terrorist group 's leadership and splinter groups			2
" there 's no question that core @entity38 in @entity65 and @entity35 has been severely diminished			2
long before admitted @entity18 leaker @entity17 entered the picture , relations between the @entity86 and @entity16 were deteriorating			1
your administration said that your planned summit with @entity16 leader @entity90 would probably have been canceled even with @entity16 granting @entity17 asylum because there would be little to talk about			1
how does the @entity86 improve relations with @entity16 with so many issues between the two countries ? on wednesday , the @entity20 officially announced what many in the media had been speculating : @entity2 would not meet @entity90 in september ahead of the @entity99 summit in @entity100			1
the @entity20 cited a lack of progress on a number of bilateral issues , but admitted that @entity16 's decision to grant temporary asylum to @entity17 , the former government contractor who leaked classified documents , was a factor in the decision			1
in the past , @entity2 has been dismissive of @entity17			1
while on his trip through @entity11 , @entity2 said he was n't " going to be scrambling jets to get a 29 - year - old hacker " and in the " @entity55 " interview , @entity2 said he wanted to see @entity17 back in the @entity86 to face trial " with a lawyer and due process			1
" a senior administration official told @entity1 on wednesday that " we just had n't gotten any traction " on issues that the summit would have addressed , including missile - defense and a reduction in nuclear missiles			2
attempts to find common ground on economic and trade agreements as well as differing approaches on @entity129 also were problematic			0
your campaign and other @entity132 leveled a number of hard " @entity137 " charges against @entity135 and @entity136			0
yet , in the past month , three @entity132 politicians -- @entity139 and @entity140 in @entity141 and @entity142 in @entity143 -- have put their issues with women front and center and are asking for support			2
as the leader of the @entity132 , how do you feel that these three men represent your party ? and would you vote for them if you were able to ? during the 2012 campaign , @entity132 and the @entity2 campaign regularly hit @entity136 presidential nominee @entity135 for some of his socially conservative positions			1
in july 2012 , the @entity2 campaign released an ad attacking @entity135 's stance on women 's issues			1
" i 've never felt this way before , but it 's a scary time to be a woman , " a woman , staring directly at the camera , said			2
" @entity135 is just so out of touch			0
" but in the past few months , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity142 have made headlines for their issues with women			0
eleven women have accused @entity142 , the mayor @entity143 , of sexual harassment while he was mayor or a congressman from @entity173			0
@entity139 -- whose " sexting " scandal forced his resignation from @entity177 in 2011 -- is now running for mayor of @entity141 , all while being dogged by new revelations around the same issue			2
and @entity140 , who resigned as @entity141 governer in 2008 after it was revealed he had an solicited prostitutes , is now running for @entity141 comptroller			0
@entity2 has yet to comment on the issue , but @entity71 told reporters last month that the president was more focused on economic growth , and that the @entity20 would not comment on @entity139 or @entity142			1
) the state exchanges and marketplaces for @entity190 will go into effect in a few months and some states have already begun publishing their new premium costs			0
what are your thoughts about the increased premiums ? do you think the fact that some states will experience such high increases discredits the law ? will it make it more difficult to meet enrollment goals ? although enrollment in @entity190 state exchanges begins on october 1 , with the coverage the plans provide actually kicking in at the start of 2014 , many states have been preparing for the health care changes by releasing preliminary plans and rates			0
in some states , insurances purchasers would n't be blamed for suffering from a bit of sticker shock			0
according to @entity221 officials , premiums for the mid-level insurance plan will rise between 7.6 % and 58.8 % , depending on the insurer			0
the average increase in the state would be 35 %			0
@entity226 officials , meanwhile , compared trade association 's report of premiums available today with the average premiums expected for the exchange and found the price would increase 41 %			0
earlier this week , @entity71 said the implementation of @entity190 " is very much a high priority of the president 's , and he is engaged in discussions about progress being made on implementation , as you would expect , and certainly the rest of the administration is			0
) you told @entity132 on @entity243 last week that you would n't negotiate on the debt ceiling when @entity177 returns in september			0
why did you choose to take such a hard line so early ? and you have been in these congressional negotiations before -- what have you learned from past debt negotiations that many have said did not go well ? when @entity2 met with @entity243 @entity132 last week , a senior @entity250 told @entity1 that the president told legislators that he is " not negotiating on debt ceiling , " but that he will " look at a reasonable plan if the @entity136 have one			1
" @entity255 , @entity2 's treasury secretary , backed up those comments on multiple sunday show appearances , including with @entity1			1
" @entity177 has to do its work , " @entity255 told @entity258			0
one of the first things lawmakers must do in september is fund the government past september 30 , when the 2013 fiscal year ends			0
on top of that , according to estimates by economists and budget experts , the nation 's borrowing authority , or debt ceiling , will need to be raised sometime before mid-november			0
@entity2 has been here before			2
in 2011 , he and @entity20 speaker @entity272 negotiated with one another over the debt ceiling			2
those negotiations eventually collapsed -- ultimately ending in acrimony			0
" if i look back over the year and a half or so that i 've been speaker , my greatest disappointment was that the president and i could n't come to an agreement in solving our debt crisis , " @entity272 told @entity1 @entity20 correspondent @entity277 in a 2012 interview .			2
