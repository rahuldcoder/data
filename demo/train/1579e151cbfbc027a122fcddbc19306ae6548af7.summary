some call @entity1 the " @entity2 "			1
but while the intricate waterways may replicate the layout of the picturesque @entity7 city , living conditions could hardly be more contrasting			2
makeshift houses with corrugated iron roofs balance precariously atop stilts			2
down below , narrow wooden boats act as a form of aquatic taxi ferrying goods and people around the bustling community			2
nobody knows the exact population of this slum district of @entity18 but it is estimated to be as high as 100,000			1
what 's sure is that few tourists will come here to take a romantic gondola trip beneath the night sky , moonlight bouncing off the water onto informal shacks			2
there is little by the way of a sewer system meaning all sorts of pungent smells are sure to puncture the nostrils			2
on top of that , law enforcement agencies rarely enter the slum with security left to groups of young men known locally as the " @entity39			2
" a lens on home for photographer @entity43 , however , the muddy waters of @entity1 have always been home			1
the aspiring 24 - year - old was born , raised and continues to live in this chaotic floating district			1
as such , it is one of the subjects he feels most comfortable turning his ever more popular lens on			2
" i started my photography here in @entity1 , " @entity43 told @entity51 when we meet at the plush surrounds of the 2014 @entity54			1
" it 's really inspiring ...			0
i 've been able to get a lot of inspiration in terms of seeing a lot of things in my community , " he added			0
@entity43 's career has really begun to take off in recent years			1
after learning his craft in workshops put on by the @entity68 he went on to study photojournalism at the @entity70			0
he 's since had photos exhibited at various national arts and photography festivals as well as appearing in numerous international magazines and publications			0
international collaboration @entity43 has even worked alongside the respected @entity78 photographer @entity77			1
" ( i am ) happy to see some of my work published , " he said			0
" and to see the fact of my name written on the pictures is something very great			0
" yet despite the international recognition , its the daily hustle and bustle of @entity1 that continues to inspire @entity43			1
he explains that his knowledge of the local customs , attitudes and the people who live there gives him an edge over those who may come from outside to document life in the community			1
" to tell the story with this ( holding up a camera ) , you have to know who this guy is ( pointing to a man in a photograph )			0
" just by looking at him , " is he happy or is he not happy ? you have to try to know what it is all about			0
" you ca n't just pick up your camera and start shooting , " he said			0
here and now then there 's the skill vital for any photojournalist to develop , the handy knack of being in the right place at the right time			0
@entity43 was rapidly on the spot when a fire that tore through part of @entity1 in 2013			1
the scenes were horrific but the images @entity43 captured told the story and brought some of the harsh realities of life in the slum to the outside world			1
they appeared in numerous publications in print and online			0
" the fire was caused by a generator and it burned a lot of houses in the community , " @entity43 explained			1
" i had the opportunity to get there at the right time and try document what the scene was all about , what caused the scene ( and ) what caused the fire outbreak , " he added			2
it is likely the @entity1 fire would n't have garnered as much attention in the national and international press without @entity43 's timely and grabbing images			1
the experience has made him even more aware of the importance of having local people tell the story of the community there			0
so much so that it has inspired him on to his next challenge			0
" i want to go further , i want to know more , " he said			0
when pushed on what this means , he added , " you know , maybe having a university degree ( so i can ) come back to the community and teach people ... to become what i am today			0
" maybe then the outside world will be able to appreciate even more of life in @entity1 through the sharp - shooting eyes of its residents .			1
