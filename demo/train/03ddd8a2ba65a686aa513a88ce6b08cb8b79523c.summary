-- a @entity2 man accused of gunning down an unarmed young woman on his front porch took the stand in his own defense monday			1
@entity7 , 55 , told jurors he feared for his life when loud banging on his front and kitchen doors startled him awake in the early morning hours of november 2 , 2013			1
wafer is facing charges of second - degree murder and manslaughter for killing 19 - year - old @entity16 , who prosecutors said was on @entity12 's porch in @entity19 seeking help after a car accident			1
on the stand , @entity12 said he thinks of @entity16 daily			1
" this poor girl , she had her whole life in front of her , " he said , wiping his eyes			0
he could face life in prison if convicted			0
@entity16 had a blood - alcohol level of 0.218 at the time of her death and had smoked marijuana earlier in the evening , according to testimony			1
witnesses said she crashed her vehicle into a parked car just before 1 a.m. and wandered off disoriented and bloodied			0
some three hours later , she was hit in the face by a fatal shotgun blast on @entity12 's porch			2
the incident sparked protest and drew the attention of activist @entity44 , likened by some to the shooting of unarmed @entity48 teen @entity47 in 2012			0
@entity16 was african - american			1
@entity12 , who is white , was criminally charged more than two weeks after the killing			2
in the @entity52 courtroom monday , @entity12 described feeling the floor vibrate under his feet from the violent banging , which moved back and forth between the front and kitchen doors			2
he said he could n't find his cell phone to call 911 , but retrieved his @entity60 12 - guage shotgun from a closet and opened the front door at a quiet moment			2
" i was not going to cower			0
i did n't want to be a victim in my own house , " he said			1
@entity12 claimed he had forgotten the weapon was loaded and hoped only to scare the trespassers			2
when a figure appeared from around the corner , he said , he pulled the trigger as a " reflex reaction " due to fear : " it was them or me			0
" earlier in the trial , prosecutors called police witnesses who said they found no pry marks , kick marks or damage to the locking mechanisms of the front door			0
@entity83 medical examiner dr. kilak @entity82 testified he saw no injuries to @entity16 's hands during her autopsy that could have been caused by violent pounding			2
a defense expert disputed that characterization			0
dr. @entity90 , who held the medical examiner 's post in @entity83 for 16 years , told jurors he in fact saw injury , swelling and fresh blood in a photograph of @entity16 's hand , saying those were not the products of the car wreck hours earlier			1
@entity12 's attorneys also called to the stand crime scene reconstructionist @entity103 , who testified the screen in @entity12 's front door was already damaged and knocked out of its frame when @entity12 fired through it			1
the distance from the muzzle of @entity12 's weapon to @entity16 's face , said @entity103 , would have been no more than two feet			1
throughout the case , defense attorneys have fought to admit cell phone " selfies " of @entity16 taken weeks before the incident , that they say point to criminal and aggressive tendencies			1
the selfies show the teen " flashing hand signals and exhibiting ' wannabe ' elements of gang culture , " with " piles of marijuana and packaging materials indicating marijuana distribution , " with wads of cash and pointing a handgun at the camera , according to court documents			0
@entity83 circuit court judge @entity135 has not allowed the photographs despite repeated motions by the defense			0
starting her cross examination monday afternoon , assistant @entity83 prosecutor @entity139 questioned whether @entity12 's tears on the stand were genuine and played a lengthy video of his police interview done within hours of the shooting			1
" do you remember ever crying within two to three hours after you shot @entity16 ? " she asked			0
" no , i do n't think so , " replied @entity12			1
" you did n't cry , right ? " continued @entity139			0
