when @entity2 , @entity1 's @entity3 bureau chief , arrived in @entity4 on august 21 , 1971 , he says it was akin to visiting @entity6 today			1
the country was midway through the turmoil of @entity10 's @entity9			2
universities and schools were just re-opening and students brandishing little red books toiled in factories or on farms			2
@entity2 , then a firebrand student leader from the @entity18 on a study tour , found himself stuck in @entity4 after his name was placed on a blacklist by then @entity18 president @entity22			1
fearing arrest as martial law was declared in his home country in september 1972 , he stayed on along with four others from the study tour			2
a year later his passport expired , leaving him temporarily stateless			2
" the idea was to come for three weeks and see what was going on , " he says			2
" i 'm an accidental tourist			2
" he ended up staying for more than four decades and launching a career as a journalist just as @entity4 began opening up to the world			1
on his day of retirement from @entity1 , he reflects on his " ring side ticket " to @entity4 's rise : what was life like under @entity10 ? when it became clear we were staying in @entity4 , we wanted to study but universities were n't ready to enroll foreign students , so we asked to work			1
our hosts did n't make us , but we insisted			2
i worked on a state farm in @entity48 province			0
initially , i found it a romantic idea but it did n't take long for the romance to wear off			0
at the end of the day , we carved out two hours to learn @entity4			1
our interpreter was our teacher and by the end of those few months on the farm i could converse in @entity4			1
from late 1972 , i worked on a fishing boat for two years			0
we 'd go out on the high seas for five or six days at a time on two trawler ships pulling a huge net			0
it was a spartan life , very simple			0
it was sometimes bleak but often also exciting because of the political campaigns that were going on			0
we would only watch from the sidelines -- see posters and in private discussions with @entity4 friends			1
we were told not to get involved			0
tell us about some of your memories of university and your circle of classmates			0
i was in the class of 1977 -- the first class when college students were enrolled through a nationwide entrance examination			0
among my cohorts was current premier @entity79 ; he studied law			0
also among them was @entity82 , once one of the most powerful politicians in @entity4 , now disgraced and sentenced to life in prison for corruption and abuse of power			1
he was in my world history class			0
we would stand in the cafeteria holding our bowls of food -- there were no chairs to sit on -- and he dared to come close to foreign students like me			0
he knew enough @entity95 to chat with me and even then was quite charismatic and opinionated			0
a lot of that batch of fellow students are now in important roles in the government bureaucracy			0
some are top professors , scientists and entrepreneurs			0
i 've kept friends with many of them			0
they 've been good sounding boards			0
you 've witnessed the trial of the @entity109 , the @entity110 and the @entity111			2
what else stands out ? i covered @entity114 's concert , the first @entity116 pop group to perform in @entity4			1
it was attended by thousands of @entity3 residents , most of whom just looked perplexed			1
police looked on sternly if anyone stood up to cheer and dance			0
i remember when @entity124 went on sale for the first time -- people thought it tasted like a @entity4 medicine concoction			1
later on , it was a big treat to interview @entity130 when he chosen as the number one @entity132 draft			0
i 'm a huge basketball fan and @entity130 turned out to be a humble and affable guy although i got a sore neck			0
when i was at @entity137 , my big scoop was breaking the news of @entity140 's ( @entity10 's widow who went on trial as part of the @entity109 ) suicide several days before it was reported by @entity144			2
but to be honest scoops like that were rare and perhaps less important than providing accurate and fair reports and analysis day after day , week after week			2
you 're the longest - serving foreign correspondent in @entity4			1
how has covering the country changed ? it 's easier than it used to be in the 1980s			2
there was a then 10 - day rule that required us to give notice if we wanted to leave @entity3			1
technically , except for @entity156 , we can now go anywhere as long as someone invited us			0
in recent years though , there have been signs of tightening			0
many colleagues , including our own crew , have had brushes with authorities -- the hand in front of the camera			0
@entity1 comes under heavy scrutiny because it 's so closely associated with the @entity170 and we have been accused of biased reporting on @entity4			1
i 've had to explain to officials here that we 're not an extension of @entity170 government ; we are independent			0
we report it as we see it			0
@entity4 is a much wealthier place than when you first arrived			1
have all the changes you 've seen since the 1970s been for the better ? i echo what my @entity4 friends would say			1
they enjoy much more personal freedom -- the freedom to travel , to choose where to live , to marry whoever they wish , to take a job or quit a job			0
freedom of speech and expression has it limits but most people know where the red line lies			0
of course , there are problems			2
many are the unintended consequences of the reform that started 30 years ago like environmental pollution and degradation -- and the lack of a spiritual anchor for most @entity4			1
i see a nation of 1.3 billion seemingly rudderless , looking for direction and meaning in their lives , even those who are rich			1
it 's not a big secret			2
i think the government acknowledges this crisis of faith			0
you 've lived in @entity4 for 40 years and raised a family here			1
how do you feel about it ? i 've lived here 43 years , i 've seen where it came from			2
i appreciate all the quotidian changes			0
i tend to look at @entity4 as a glass half full rather than half empty because i 've seen it virtually empty			1
it was my refuge and later my training and battle ground as journalist			0
i feel bittersweet to be ending my time here as a foreign correspondent			0
it 's been a rewarding experience and not really the end			2
i 'll still be involved in @entity4 watching , in @entity4 , or wherever my next projects and adventures take me			1
in the next few months , my wife @entity232 and i will stay on in @entity3 , where she is gainfully employed			1
for a change , i will be the " trailing spouse " but later i hope to do a bit of writing and speechifying			0
should you leave @entity4 , what will you miss about it ? @entity4 's been my second home , although it will never replace the @entity18 as my homeland			1
i 'll definitely not miss the @entity3 smog , but will certainly miss the quaint , old neighborhood nearby , including the men who belt out visceral shouts early in the morning , their way of exercise , my wake - up call			1
i 'll miss the guttural accent of the @entity3 taxi drivers and their unsolicited opinions			1
i 'll miss the food -- jianbing , zhajiangmian , @entity3 duck -- and , yes , my periodic foot massage			1
of course , i 'll miss my friends , who 've accepted me as a virtual @entity256 ( @entity3 )			1
what 's your advice for journalists in @entity4 ? the best stories are often of ordinary people doing extraordinary deeds			1
keep up the good fight for fair , honest and nuanced reporting			0
i feel fortunate to have been in the right place at the right time to have witnessed these changes up close			2
for better or worse , @entity4 now is a major player in the world			1
i never imagined @entity4 could be so prosperous , powerful and proud			2
whatever @entity4 does , or does not do , has impact on global affairs and our lives			1
for our sake , and @entity4 's too , i hope @entity4 will emerge as a peace - loving global power			1
@entity1 's @entity277 in @entity278 contributed to this report			1

@entity2 , @entity1 's @entity3 bureau chief , has lived in @entity4 for four decades
on his last day with @entity1 , he reflects on his " ring side ticket " to @entity4 's rise
the changes he 's witnessed have been mainly *positive* but problems remain
