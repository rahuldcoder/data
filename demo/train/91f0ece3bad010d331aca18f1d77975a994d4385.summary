-- floating high above the @entity2 , astronaut @entity1 pointed her camera at a swirling white cloud spreading across the planet			1
little did she know the devastation that was unfurling beneath			0
this remarkable image of @entity8 over the @entity9 , was taken by the @entity11 astronaut during a five - month mission in space			1
it was one of many specular photographs taken by @entity1 -- who in 2008 became the 50th woman in space -- and was retweeted thousands of times by her followers back on @entity2			1
@entity0 spoke to the mechanical engineering professor earlier this year , in a live broadcast from the @entity24			1
watch the full interview here as she returned to @entity2 this week , we again caught up with the @entity29 astronaut to chat about her fascinating experiments and adjusting to life back on the blue planet			2
@entity0 : what was it like , taking a photograph like that and realizing the impact it might have on @entity2 as you looked out the window ? @entity1 : it definitely makes you think , because it 's so beautiful when you look out the window			1
i could n't even fit the entire storm in one picture			0
i used a 50 millimeter lens to capture as much as i could , but just knowing the devastation underneath this beautiful cloud is pretty sad			0
@entity0 : you 've also taken some other photographs which have been just as beautiful , and not caused such a devastating impact -- like sunrises over @entity2			2
@entity53 : yes , i love taking pictures and i enjoyed it more and more as the mission went on -- that 's probably one of the things i 'll miss the most			0
it was a great geography lesson for me too , to get these images from all over the world			0
@entity0 : do you see the world in the same way , as before you went up as an astronaut ? @entity53 : you actually do see it a little differently -- in a strange way you feel closer to everybody			1
i wish everybody could experience that			0
@entity0 : what sort of experiments were you working on while you were up there ? @entity53 : a lot of the experiments were being done on us -- looking at our eyesight and how that changes , and looking at our bone density and how that changes by the effects of micro gravity			1
we also did a lot of experiments on fluids and combustion -- a lot of these are for developing systems to travel further into outer space , and a lot of them will really benefit what we 're doing on @entity2			2
@entity0 : a lot of astronauts apparently experience long - term vision problems after returning to @entity2 -- is that something that 's happened to you , and do you know what causes it ? @entity53 : i had some vision changes during my stay on the space station , but it 's coming back to normal again -- i think that 's happened frequently to other astronauts			1
i have n't experienced long - term changes but we have done quite intensive studies on me and my crew mates			0
@entity0 : what are other changes you 've noticed since coming back to @entity2 ? @entity53 : it seems like i never left in a lot of ways -- it 's almost a time warp			2
you get back to home and work , and it 's like you were never away			0
i think i 'll need to go back and look at my pictures pretty soon and reminisce			0
to see more of @entity1 's photographs from space , follow her on @entity123 or like her on @entity124			1
