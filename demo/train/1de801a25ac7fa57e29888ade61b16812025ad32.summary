-- @entity1 is not one to shy away from a battle			1
he is a hardened warrior -- a man who has fought on the golf course and on the soil of his beloved @entity5			2
he lost his father when he was a child before watching his friends die during the @entity9 war			2
and yet now , at the age of 56 , he remains philosophical about his life -- one in which he emerged to become one of the greatest to have ever played the game of golf			2
" i 'm so grateful to my family for instilling values since an early age , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity17			1
" i 've carried them through me throughout this time			0
" i lost my father when i was 10 and sometimes that has an adverse effect on the family but for us it brought us closer together			0
" it was a huge time in my life			0
i went to the military for a year - and - a - half and all those things shape you			0
" you ca n't go through life without help and support			0
i 've had a great time			0
" when you think of how i started playing golf i still have to pinch myself every now and againt because this is my life			0
" @entity1 , who will captain the international team at this week 's @entity40 at @entity41 , @entity42 , has taken the long road to the top			1
born in @entity45 and raised in @entity9 , before it became @entity5 , @entity1 spent his time as a child hitting plastic balls at tomato cans			1
it was only in 1974 at the age of 17 when he won the @entity53 at @entity54 in @entity55 that he realized he could make a career in golf			2
from there he was catapulted to stardom -- winning three major titles and claiming 15 @entity61 wins during an illustrious career which saw him stay at @entity63 in the world in 1994 for 43 consecutive weeks			2
but there is one victory away from all of his personal success which stands out -- the victory of the international team over the @entity69 at the @entity70 at @entity71			1
the tournament which pitches a @entity69 team of 12 against a team of non-europeans has been held every two years since 1994 and includes two rounds of foursomes , two rounds of four balls and a singles finale			1
for a man who has played in five of these tournaments , @entity1 is only too aware of how glorious victory would be , especially following the 19 - 15 defeat two years ago			1
and yet the prospect of beating the @entity69 brings up conflicting feelings for @entity1 , who says he could " never repay the country for what it has given me			1
" " our three kids were born here and i 've just had the best time ever here , " said @entity1 , who lives in @entity91			1
" honestly , i sometimes get recognized more often here than i do in my own home country , which is kind of sad			0
" i had more awards and everything given to me in this country than i did in my own country , which hurts a lot			0
" what has happened in the country in the last 33 years is not what we all expected			0
" history is not on @entity1 's side -- the @entity69 has dominated the competition , losing just once and being held once in the previous nine editions			1
the international team boasts an array of talent including @entity113 champion @entity113 , four - time major winner @entity114 , @entity116 's two - time major winner @entity115 and @entity45 's @entity117			1
@entity1 believes that victory for his side is vital if the competition is to recapture the imagination of the public with the dominance of the @entity69 leaving several golf fans disillusioned with the dual			1
but while he expects passions to run high , @entity1 wants his men to keep their cool against @entity128 and co. " i 'm a big one for confrontations , " said @entity1			1
" i keep telling my guys , ' let 's go out and win this cup			0
' " i do n't want to see them become enemies for one week -- what i want to see is great competition			2
" i want to see them go out there and want to beat each other and look at each other in the eye after you 've finished and say ' congratulations , you played better today			0
' " i do n't want people coming up with excuses and walking off the greens while the other player is putting			0
" to me that brings the whole game into a very sad state			0
" the @entity69 team boasts a wealth of talent and experience with the likes of @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 lining up alongside world @entity160			1
@entity1 realizes his team faces a difficult challenge to triumph in @entity164 , @entity42 but says he will do all that he can as captain to inspire his men to a momentous victory			1
" being captain is a doubled edged sword -- it can hurt you and it can help you a lot , " he said			1
" i 'm trying to be a captain that is going to be very supportive of my team but not over captain them and there 's a very fine line between that			2
" you want to give the guys advice			0
i 'm certainly not in the @entity181 type -- running out over the course and saying ' hit here and do this ' but that was @entity181 , that was the way guys expected when he was captain			2
" i just want them to know i 'm going to be there to support them in anything they need to know or need to use me as a sounding board			0
i 'm going to be there			0

@entity1 will captain the international team int the @entity40
