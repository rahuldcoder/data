-- @entity1 , the man famous for hating religion , is now becoming infamous for hating one religion in particular : @entity4			1
on last week 's episode of his @entity7 show , " @entity8 , " @entity1 got into a heated exchange with @entity10 over @entity1 's use of sweeping generalizations to define @entity4			1
in fact , @entity10 went as far as to dub @entity1 's views of @entity15 as " gross " and " racist			1
" ( @entity1 had no @entity15 on the panel in discussing @entity4 -- but that is typical for his show			1
) @entity1 's @entity21 comments are nothing new			1
i first noticed @entity1 's @entity15 problem in 2010 when he said on his show , " the most popular name in the @entity26 , @entity27 -- this was in the news this week -- was @entity29			1
am i a racist to feel that i 'm alarmed by that ? because i am			0
... i do n't have to apologize , do i , for not wanting the western world to be taken over by @entity4 in 300 years ? " this was not about so called " radical @entity4			2
" rather , @entity1 seemed alarmed that @entity15 were growing in population			1
flash forward to 2012 , when @entity1 discussed how women are unfairly treated in certain @entity15 countries , which is truly an issue deserving of discussion			1
but @entity1 chose not to rely on facts ; instead , he offered anecdotal evidence to support his argument , saying things like , " talk to women who 've ever dated an @entity43 man			2
the results are not good			0
" well , my @entity46 mother not only dated an @entity43 man , she married him			0
and by all accounts , " the results " were great			0
@entity1 kept on advancing stereotypes about an entire people based on little evidence			2
he ratcheted up his @entity21 commentary while a guest on " @entity55 " last month			2
he said that it is " naive " to think that @entity4 is n't more violent than other religions and mocked president @entity58 for commenting that the terror group @entity59 was not @entity4			0
@entity1 's remarks dismayed @entity61 @entity15 across the country but won applause from all the hosts on @entity66 ' " the five			1
" when you 're a progressive and a gaggle of @entity66 hosts praises your views , you know something is seriously wrong			0
in recent weeks on his show , @entity1 gave us a long rant rallying liberals to stand up to @entity4			1
for support , he cited the high instance of female genital mutilation in the muslim - majority countries of @entity81 and @entity82			0
look , i agree with @entity1 that @entity84 is horrific			0
but as religious scholar @entity85 pointed out on @entity0 , @entity84 is based on @entity87 culture -- not @entity4			0
african christian - majority nations also have very high rates of @entity84			0
in fact , there are far fewer reported cases of @entity84 in @entity15 nations outside of @entity87			0
@entity1 continued his personal jihad by claiming that @entity4 is like the @entity95 , in that you will be killed if you attempt to leave the faith			1
@entity1 then cited a @entity99 poll that he claimed found that 90 % of @entity82 supported the death penalty for those who left @entity4			1
i 'm not sure where @entity1 got his numbers , but a 2013 @entity99 poll actually found only 64 % of @entity82 supported this -- still alarmingly high , but not 90 %			0
more importantly , @entity82 does not define the @entity15 world			0
rather , @entity82 is simply one of 47 @entity15 - majority nations			0
that same poll found that in @entity110 , a nation that has almost as many @entity15 as @entity82 , less than 5 % supported the death penalty for leaving @entity4			2
@entity1 also has left out that only 13 @entity15 nations have penalties for apostasy , while 34 do not			2
so who truly defines @entity4 ? to @entity1 , clearly it 's the worst of our faith			1
that 's something you would expect to hear from a far - right bigot , not a liberal			0
@entity125 columnist @entity124 , who was also a guest on last week 's show , attempted to make that very point			0
@entity124 , who was interrupted before finishing his thought , remarked about @entity1 's comments on @entity4 : " this does have a tinge a little bit of how white racists talk about @entity134			1
how can @entity1 not see that he 's mimicking that same type of hateful mindset ? i 'm all for a discussion of the need to reform the laws in certain @entity15 countries , especially on issues of rights for women , minority faiths and gays			2
but painting all @entity15 by the most extreme of our faith is wrong			1
this is the kind of bigotry that @entity1 would 've rallied against in the past			2
my fellow liberals should no longer give @entity1 a pass			0
his continuous drumbeat of reckless comments about @entity15 is contributing to a climate where @entity61 muslims are increasingly seen as " the other " -- or worse , as the enemy			2
just because @entity1 is progressive on certain issues does not excuse his bigotry on this issue .			1

@entity164 : @entity1 is becoming infamous for *bashing* @entity4 religion
@entity164 : @entity1 has made a series of @entity21 comments that some call racist
painting all @entity15 by the most extreme of our faith is wrong and reckless , he writes
@entity164 : just because @entity1 is progressive does not excuse his bigotry on this issue
