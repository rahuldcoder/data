-- for most , @entity1 is the time to celebrate with family and friends , but for some of the highest paid sportsmen in the world the festive season is their busiest time of the year with titles and their reputation on the line			1
@entity13 football players have particularly hectic schedules with three games in little more than a week over @entity1			1
most clubs insist their squads train on christmas day itself ahead of the traditional @entity19 ( december 26 ) program , while just two days later the likes of @entity22 and @entity23 are back in action again ahead of a third match on @entity26			2
@entity23 's @entity27 and reigning title holders @entity29 are involved in a tense battle at the top of the @entity13 and a run of poor form in the holiday period can prove a decisive factor at the championship race			1
at the bottom of the table , it 's also a critical period and statistics point to the team bottom of the @entity13 at @entity1 being relegated , although last season @entity42 escaped			1
while their @entity13 counterparts are straining every sinew , @entity45 players have their feet up , taking a five - week mid-season break with @entity47 11 points clear at the top and heading for yet another @entity51 title			2
@entity53 's @entity52 takes a fortnight break with @entity55 in the middle of a 22 - match unbeaten run which has seen @entity59 and his teammates clinch the @entity61 and top the table ahead of arch - rival @entity63			0
it 's the same story in the other major football leagues of @entity66 and @entity67 , leaving the @entity13 as the odd one out , but with little sign there is any appetite for a change to bring it into line with its @entity74 counterparts			2
sports fans in the @entity76 are also promised a glut of action , with the @entity79 ( @entity79 ) hosting a daily program with the exception of @entity82			1
but five @entity79 games are scheduled for christmas day , with tv coverage stretching throughout the day for the armchair fan			2
many will be tuning in to watch @entity87 on his return to the @entity89 as his @entity90 plays @entity91			0
@entity87 , who became a free agent in the summer after helping @entity91 to win two @entity79 titles , opted to rejoin the @entity90 -- which did not endear him to @entity91 fans			0
the @entity95 ( @entity95 ) regular program also concludes , with playoff berths still up for grabs , on sunday december 28 , with the countdown to the @entity100 in @entity101 on february 1 in full swing			1
@entity103 and @entity26 also sees crucial bowl games in the @entity76 @entity105 season , drawing vast tv audiences			0
you have to go " @entity112 " to @entity108 for a pair of @entity19 events which are forever etched into the sporting calendar			1
the cavernous @entity113 ( @entity113 ) hosts a cricket test match between @entity108 and @entity115 , particularly poignant in the light of the recent death of @entity118			1
last year 's @entity119 drew a world record crowd for a cricket match as @entity108 was on its way to humbling the old enemy in the shape of @entity125			0
while the cricket gets underway , @entity126 is a flurry of activity as the fleet in the punishing @entity132 yacht race begins its 628 nautical miles journey			0
thousands of people and hundreds of small craft watch the competitors on the way in the " @entity138 " which first started in 1945 and was won last year by @entity139 for other sports stars @entity1 remains a time to pause for thought ahead of 2015 , with the @entity143 tennis championship in @entity113 the first major global event of the year			0
@entity145 is set to take part in the big exhibition event in @entity148 which starts on @entity26 ahead of yet another comeback from injury , with the regular @entity152 and @entity153 seasons beginning in earnest in the first week of january .			0
