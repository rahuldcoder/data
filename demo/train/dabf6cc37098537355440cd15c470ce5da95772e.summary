@entity0 , @entity1 -- an amateur league of ill - trained rebel fighters appears to be on the brink of toppling @entity7 's 42 - year rule after reportedly capturing two of the leader 's sons and infiltrating the @entity1 capital			1
but in a possible indication that the fight is not over , celebrations in @entity0 's @entity13 -- renamed @entity13 by the rebels -- gave way to tension monday morning after rebels told @entity2 that they 'd heard @entity7 army forces were heading their way			1
@entity2 could not confirm any movement of @entity7 forces			1
the uncertainty came hours after a rebel official said two of @entity7 's sons -- @entity26 and @entity27 -- had been arrested by opposition forces			1
@entity29 , a rebel spokesman based in @entity1 's western mountain region , said both were captured in @entity0			1
@entity33 chief prosecutor @entity32 said the court plans monday to contact authorities associated with those holding @entity26 to try to arrange for his transfer to the @entity38 for an eventual trial for " crimes against humanity			2
" the court , based in @entity43 , issued an arrest warrant earlier this summer for @entity45 as well as his father and his uncle @entity46			2
@entity48 , a businessman and onetime professional soccer player , helped set up an april @entity2 interview with a woman who claimed she 'd been raped by government troops			0
he later told @entity2 that those behind the attack should be prosecuted			0
there was no immediate reaction from @entity1 government officials to the reports of the sons ' arrests			1
in an audio address broadcast just before midnight sunday , @entity7 claimed " very small groups of people who are collaborators with the imperialists " were fighting inside the capital			1
should the rebels prevail , @entity7 said @entity67 would not protect them and predicted massive bloodshed			1
to prevent such bloodshed , he said , @entity1 , including women , should go out and fight			1
" get out and lead , lead , lead the people to paradise , " he said			1
just after midnight sunday , scores of raucous rebel supporters packed @entity13 -- the same place where @entity7 loyalists have congregated regularly -- celebrating , waving the rebel flag and even flashing the " victory " sign			1
@entity67 secretary general @entity81 said sunday that " the @entity7 regime is clearly crumbling , " and urged the leader to acknowledge defeat			1
" @entity86 fighters are in control of most of the neighborhoods in @entity0 , " said @entity29 , the rebel spokesman			2
a main supply route into western @entity0 that had been the scene of intense fighting was clear early monday , occupied only by rebels heading toward the capital			2
@entity2 's @entity93 reported around 3 a.m. that the route heading to @entity13 was " eerily quiet , " with cars passing by checkpoints run by opposition loyalists			1
between 100 and 150 rebel fighters by then had gathered in the square , only to scatter an hour later amid concerns about possible snipers and an upcoming battle there , in the heart of the city			1
the advance included members of the " @entity108 , " a group of rebel troops who 'd once lived in the capital and could help navigate the city			1
but they were n't all professional soldiers , such as one it worker who had n't held a gun before joining the movement a few months ago			0
they entered a city that , after being largely free of large - scale fighting since the conflict began six months ago , became the site of intense drama and significant violence over the weekend			0
@entity1 government spokesman @entity123 told reporters just after 11 p.m. sunday that about 1,300 people had been killed and about 5,000 wounded in fighting in the previous 12 hours			1
" ( the city ) is being turned into a hellfire , " he said			0
the spokesman denied a report from @entity130 - language news network @entity129 that @entity7 's guard had surrendered , calling it " false information			1
" in another sign of possible trouble for the regime , the signal for state - run television -- which has long been a forum for @entity139 views -- repeatedly froze , with the station later claiming there had been " interference " due to a " hostile media campaign			2
" the network reverted to taped broadcasts of previous @entity139 gatherings			0
a fierce gun battle broke out sunday evening near the hotel where many international reporters were stationed in @entity0			0
many government officials packed their suitcases and left the hotel earlier in the day			2
a woman in @entity0 said late sunday that she and others went outside , " screaming " and calling for @entity7 's ouster -- and had plenty of company			1
" we realized that no one wants him , no one wants this dictator , " said the resident , whom @entity2 is not naming for safety reasons			0
@entity123 told @entity2 on sunday that " more than 65,000 professional men " are fighting in @entity0 , with thousands more flooding in to help defend the regime , and added they " can hold for much longer			0
" he predicted a " humanitarian disaster " unless an immediate ceasefire is called			0
" it 's not about who will win , " he said			0
" the world needs to hear this message , that a massacre will be committed in @entity0 if one side wins now			0
" some areas of eastern @entity0 , including the suburb of @entity175 , were out of government control sunday , according to a @entity1 government official who asked not to be named			1
rebels set car tires afire along barricades there , the official said			2
meanwhile , @entity183 -- a key coastal city about 30 miles west of the capital -- appeared under rebel control , with celebratory gunfire and fireworks as some yelled out , " @entity1 is free ! " @entity189 , an ambassador in the @entity190 for the @entity1 rebels ' @entity191 , said that opposition forces were calling sunday " day 1			1
" " the reason we declare it ' day 1 ' is because we feel @entity7 is already finished			2
he is already finished , most importantly , in our hearts , " he said			0
" we no longer fear him			0
" @entity29 , the government spokesman , blamed @entity67 for the conflict and appealed for a cease - fire			0
" every drop of @entity1 blood shed by these rebels is the responsibility of the western world , especially @entity67 's countries , " he said			1
" we hold ( @entity208 president @entity207 ) @entity207 , ( @entity210 prime minister @entity209 and ( @entity213 president @entity212 ) @entity211 morally responsible for every single unnecessary death that takes place in this country			0
" several @entity208 officials -- including president @entity207 , defense secretary @entity219 and secretary of state @entity220 -- were getting updates on the situation , officials said			0
" tonight , the momentum against the @entity7 regime has reached a tipping point , " @entity207 said in a statement , claiming " @entity0 is slipping from the grasp of a tyrant			2
... the surest way for the bloodshed to end is simple : @entity7 and his regime need to recognize that their rule has come to an end			2
" in the rebel hub of @entity239 , meanwhile , @entity2 ireporter @entity236 showed video of large , boisterous crowds in the city 's @entity242 reacting as reports of the developments played on a large screen			2
" the spirits are quite high , " said @entity236 , a 28 - year - old deli manager from @entity247 who said his father fled @entity239 decades ago			0
" everyone is expecting @entity0 to fall			0
" in the first of his speeches on state television sunday , though , @entity7 was still insisting the rebels -- whom he described as " infidels , " " traitors " and " gangsters " -- would fail and vowed not to back down			1
" this is the hour of victory , " he said			0
" this hour is the hour of defiance			0
" @entity2 's @entity93 , @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 and journalist @entity271 contributed to this report .			0
