@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 's competition watchdog has ordered airport operator @entity5 to sell three of its seven airports , including two in @entity1			1
@entity5 must sell @entity8 first			1
@entity5 must sell @entity8 and @entity10 airports in @entity1 and either @entity12 or @entity14 airports in @entity15 within two years , the @entity11 said thursday			1
in publishing its decision thursday , the commission said the sale of the airports will encourage competition " where today there is no competition at all			1
" @entity5 owns seven airports in the @entity4 , including @entity1 's @entity24 , @entity8 and @entity10			1
the @entity11 says there are competition problems at all seven airports , with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines			2
finding new owners for the three airports will result in lower prices and improved customer service , said @entity35 , chairman of the study			0
all three must have separate buyers , the commission said			0
" the precise pace and the precise ways in which the benefits from such competition will emerge may be uncertain , but we are confident that the benefits will build over time , driven by the momentum of the development of competition , and will be significant , " @entity35 said			0
in @entity1 , for instance , @entity5 's ownership of three airports prevents them from building more capacity and keeps prices high , the commission said			1
" the intensity of price competition may initially be limited by current capacity constraints and price controls , but these constraints are themselves at least in part the result of common ownership , " the commission said			0
@entity5 said it acknowledged the need to change but did not agree with all of the commission 's findings			2
" we believe the commission 's analysis is flawed and its remedies may be impractical in current economic conditions , " @entity5 said in a statement , adding it needs more time to consider the report before responding further			2
@entity75 , a longtime critic of @entity5 's ownership of the airports , welcomed the commission 's decision			1
" it will undoubtedly benefit consumers , " said airline spokesman @entity80			0
" better airport facilities in the @entity4 and lower prices will be the result			2
... the important next step is to ensure that there is adequate oversight of the divestment process			0
" @entity5 must sell the airports in sequence , beginning with @entity8 -- which went up for sale in september -- then @entity10 and then either @entity12 or @entity14 , the commission said			1
the @entity11 is an independent public group that investigates mergers , markets and regulated industries			0
the @entity97 , a government department , asked the commission to look into airport competition in march 2007			2
the once - state owned @entity5 , which used to be known as the @entity5 , was privatized in 1986 and floated on the stock market in 1987			0
it is now owned by @entity104 property group @entity103 .			0
