@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is not the mayor of the @entity5			1
he was proclaimed as such by @entity6 and , obviously , there 's no such thing			1
but the man who 's become one of the most visible advocates for a free and open web over the past year says that the very idea goes against the spirit of what he 's fighting for			1
" the internet has my axe , insofar as i can be helpful as a voice or a person on camera or someone at a protest , " the 29 - year - old @entity3 , best known as a co-founder of social - sharing site @entity17 , said via a deft " @entity18 " reference			1
" i will use it			0
but the reality is that the magic of the @entity5 is that there is n't any hierarchy to it			1
it 's this flat connection of people where all links are created equal			1
" @entity3 spoke with @entity2 shortly after giving a presentation at the @entity39 festival here -- one in which he shared stories from the @entity43 he and @entity17 general manager @entity44 launched during last year 's election season			1
the tour , partially crowdfunded on @entity47 , rolled from @entity48 to @entity49 and highlighted individuals and businesses whose success has been impacted by an open web			1
they ranged from a rural family farmer who said he makes 90 % of his money through internet sales to two women who met via their virtual @entity60 stores and eventually launched a brick - and - mortar jewelry shop together in @entity62			0
they 're feel - good stories , but also ones that roll into a narrative about how government controls on the internet can be dangerous to freedom , job creation and other rights and goals , @entity3 said			1
" when you can actually say , ' there is a farmer in your district right now whose life has been changed -- whose business has been transformed -- because of the internet economy ... ' it becomes a lot more real , " he says			0
@entity3 emerged as a vocal opponent of the @entity83			1
geared toward clamping down on internet piracy , critics argued that the way it was written would have given the entertainment industry the ability to shutdown otherwise legitimate websites if it was found they were wrongly hosting copyrighted material			2
with help from web bigwigs like @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , opponents eventually killed sopa and a similar piece of legislation in the @entity101			2
@entity3 , who also helped launch travel site @entity102 and runs @entity104 , a site that gives all proceeds to social causes , said that like some of his other successes , his role was a matter of good timing			1
" when i stepped away from @entity102 , this fight became my focus			2
i had a lot of time to devote to it , " he said			2
" what really won the day was millions of people taking action			0
" where i fit into that mix was , i live in @entity121 ... when the media finally had to talk about it , i could get on the subway and spend literally the entire day meeting with every major news organization , being on tv			0
" these days , he and others from the @entity83 fight are setting their sights on another bill , the @entity132			2
it 's designed to help authorities use web tools to track criminals , but critics say it 's a " @entity141 " plan that strips @entity140 privacy rights			1
so , mayor of the @entity5 is out			0
but at his presentation friday , @entity3 called on the audience to get active in politics			1
" we need more nerds in @entity148 , " he said			0
and , last week , he shared on his social accounts a " rumor roundup " article from a tech blog that said @entity3 , himself , might be mulling a run for office			1
" no comment , " he cheekily wrote			0
so ? " oh , it has popped into my mind , " he said			0
" actually -- and this is bad for the rumor roundup -- i had registered ( web domain name ) ' ohanian2013 ' ... i talked to some people who have done it before and whom i trusted for council			2
" but in the end , @entity167 ( who , at 29 , could n't shoot for the @entity101 for another year at any rate ) said he thinks he can do more for the cause from where he sits now			2
" i am having so much , i think , success in the private sector			0
it 's a cost - benefit analysis , " he said			0
" why would i trade off the freedoms i have as a private - sector individual if i 'm having as much , if not more , impact			0
" also , he joked , he 's not qualified to be a politician			0
" i see the hypocrisy of going on stage and telling people we should have more geeks in office then not doing it myself , " he said			0
" but , you know what ? by sheer virtue of the fact that i can acknowledge my own hypocrisy , i know i 'm not capable of running for office			0

@entity17 's @entity3 says the *beauty* of the @entity193 is its lack of a power hierarchy
@entity3 , 29 , became a visible *spokesman* in the fight against web piracy bills
he says timing , *location* let him devote himself to the effort
despite rumors , @entity3 says he has no desire to run for elected office
