@entity0 -- a high - ranking @entity3 government minister is calling for the speedy punishment of several police officers who were caught on a police station camera , repeatedly slapping a detained woman in the face and pulling her hair even after she had been hand - cuffed			1
the video showed an incident that took place nearly five months ago			2
but the case did not attract national outrage in @entity3 until the silent police station camera footage was broadcast last weekend by @entity3 television stations			1
the video showed a heated argument in an office between two plain - clothed police officers and @entity21 , a woman who had been arrested and brought to a police station in the western @entity3 port city of @entity24 last july			1
@entity25 , who was dressed in shorts and a tank - top , yelled and backed away from the men			2
suddenly , the officers started slapping @entity25 and yanking her hair			1
later , the camera showed them wrestling @entity25 to the ground as a third man in police uniform occasionally stepped in to help restrain the woman and pick fallen items off the floor			1
after handcuffing @entity25 , the plain - clothed officers held her against a wall and took turns delivering open - handed blows to her face			1
" the incident in @entity24 is unacceptable and we definitely consider this incident as one for which the perpetrators should be punished , " said @entity45 , @entity3 's family and social policies minister , in a statement released on her ministry 's web - site on sunday			1
" there is political will and state authority to take the required action in a speedy way			2
therefore , both legal and administrative investigations have been launched and those policemen are suspended			0
" @entity25 ' lawyer told @entity1 police arrested her client during a raid at an @entity24 night club on the night of july 16			2
" the violence against my client , which started when she was taken with the excuse that she did not have her @entity71 , continued at the police station , " the lawyer , @entity67 , told @entity1			0
" when i met my client almost a week later , she still had a black eye and there were other marks on her			0
" soon after her release on july 17 , @entity25 filed a formal complaint against the police with the assistance of the @entity82 's human rights department			0
in the meantime , authorities pressed criminal charges against @entity25 for resisting arrest and " reckless behavior			0
" " she is facing up to six years imprisonment , " said @entity67			0
" the charge against the policemen is ' cause of injury through excessive force ' with up to 1.5 years ' punishment			2
" police in @entity24 have not responded to requests from @entity1 to comment on the case			0
@entity25 ' case sparked outrage throughout the media and among human rights groups in @entity3			1
legal experts with the @entity104 ( @entity104 ) , which has been providing medical and legal support to @entity106 , told @entity1 that the number of complaints of torture and ill - treatment has grown in 2011 compared to the previous year			0
" although laws ban such behavior , there is a lack of punishment for the security forces that commit these abuses , which means that security forces are not deterred , " said @entity111 , an executive board member in the @entity104 's @entity24 branch			2
@entity111 argued that @entity25 ' case was a rarity , because the in - house police station video camera was not tampered with after the victim 's complaint was formally lodged			0
" during judicial or investigative processes of such situations , the camera recordings in the police stations ( often ) turn out to be either deleted or recorded over or the camera turns out to be broken , " @entity111 said in a phone interview with @entity1			0
" to give a rough percentage , in 80 % of the situations , this happens			0
therefore it is very important that in this case the prosecutor got hold of those videos and included them in the case file			0
" in its annual report on @entity3 in 2011 , @entity148 concluded " investigations of alleged human rights abuses by state officials remained flawed ... the losing of evidence by state officials and counter-charges being issued against those who alleged human rights abuses contributed to the perpetuation of impunity			1
" human rights activists argued @entity25 ' case also high - lighted the persistent problem of violence against women in @entity3			1
" @entity3 continues to be a country where discrimination and violence against women is high			1
in 2011 , an average of three women a day were killed , " announced the @entity104 and the @entity104 , in a joint press release this month			0
the two police officers shown beating @entity25 are expected to appear in court in february 2012			1
in her statement , @entity167 and @entity166 called @entity25 's case " an individual mistake , " and suggested it could not be attributed to all @entity3 police officers			1
" we will also be following up on this , " she concluded			0
" violence in a police station , especially against a woman , is unacceptable			2
