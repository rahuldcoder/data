federal prosecutors say they 'll seek the death penalty against @entity4 bombing suspect @entity2 , arguing that he acted in " an especially heinous , cruel and depraved manner " and lacks remorse			1
the highly anticipated announcement thursday means that when the case against @entity11 goes to trial , jurors will not only weigh whether he 's guilty , but also whether he deserves to die			1
for @entity15 , it 's one small step forward			2
her sons , @entity17 and @entity18 , each lost a leg in the bombings , which killed three people and injured more than 250 at the april 15 race			0
" i just am relieved that it 's going forward in the right direction , one step forward in the recovery process , just that the option is out there on the table for the jurors , if that 's the way it goes , " she told @entity25 's @entity24			2
whenever the case goes to trial , @entity15 said she plans to attend every day			0
" it 's important to me			2
i 'm trying to make sense of what happened that day			0
my boys went to watch a friend run the marathon , and one came home 46 days later			0
the other one , 32 days later			0
and their lives are forever changed , " she told @entity25 's @entity44			2
" so i want to try and find out , somehow , to make some sense of how somebody could do this to all these innocent people			0
" attorney general : harm caused was factor authorities allege @entity11 , a @entity56 - born @entity55 , and his brother @entity57 planted two homemade bombs near the finish line of the marathon , then killed a @entity62 police officer three days later			1
the attacks triggered the massive manhunt that led to @entity11 's capture			1
police shot and killed @entity11 during the manhunt			1
" the nature of the conduct at issue and the resultant harm compel this decision , " @entity55 attorney general @entity67 said in a statement released by the @entity69 thursday announcing that prosecutors would pursue the death penalty in the case			1
death penalty in the @entity55 gradually declining after @entity67 made his decision , prosecutors filed a notice listing factors that they argue justify a death sentence in the case			1
among them : the attack killed multiple people , involved substantial planning and premeditation and involved betrayal of the @entity55 , prosecutors said			2
@entity2 is charged with 30 federal counts stemming from the attack			1
he has pleaded not guilty to all charges			0
the decision announced thursday is no surprise , @entity25 senior legal analyst @entity93 said			1
" this is a case , that , if you believe in the death penalty , seems to cry out for the death penalty , even though the defendant is only 19 years old , and potentially the junior partner to his late brother , " @entity93 said			1
but that does n't mean it 's an open - and - shut case			2
" one of the most interesting , difficult , strategic decisions the defense faces , " @entity93 said , is whether to push for a change of venue for the trial			1
" @entity111 was obviously deeply traumatized by this incident			0
and the jury pool is @entity111 , if the case remains where it is			0
but @entity111 is also probably the most liberal city in the country			0
death penalty opposition there is higher than anywhere else , " @entity93 said			1
" so does the defense go somewhere else , where people do n't have the immediate association with the crime ? or do they go somewhere that might not oppose the death penalty in the same numbers ? " @entity129 abolished the death penalty three decades ago , but prosecutors can seek the death penalty against @entity11 because federal law allows for the penalty in certain circumstances			1
despite @entity67 's decision to authorize the death penalty in the @entity11 case , prosecutors still could reach a plea deal for a lesser sentence with his attorneys , who include death penalty lawyer @entity143			1
@entity4 terror attack timeline survivor speaks out federal officials weighed a number of factors before they announced their decision , including the opinions of victims of the deadly attack			0
survivors were asked to fill out a questionnaire about what they thought about the death penalty			1
@entity159 , who lost a leg in the bombing , said he has no doubt about where he stands : @entity11 deserves to die			1
" i prefer the death penalty , because i prefer that people know that if you terrorize our country , you 're going to be put to death , " he told @entity25 affiliate @entity164			1
" and i strongly believe that 's how it should be			2
" life since the bombing has n't been easy , he said			2
" this is almost kind of too easy for him ( @entity11 ) , " @entity159 told @entity164			1
" i still have n't walked for more than day in a prosthetic , and it 's almost a year later			0
... life 's good , you know			1
it 's going to get better , but it 's going to be a road , and it 's going to be a long road for the rest of our lives			0
" in a statement thursday , gov. @entity185 urged the state 's residents to stay strong			0
" one way or another , based on the evidence , @entity11 will die in prison			2
in each milestone of the case -- today 's announcement , the trial and every other significant step in the justice process -- the people hurt by the @entity4 bombings and the rest of us so shocked by it will relive that tragedy , " he said			0
" the best we can do is remind each other that we are a stronger @entity206 than ever , and that nothing can break that spirit			0
" victims ' mom : ' it should n't have happened ' @entity11 's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment			1
reached before federal authorities announced their decision to seek the death penalty , @entity218 , the suspect 's mother , did not comment on the specifics of the case			1
" we are , you know , sickened about our child			2
... we have nothing in our heads or in our hearts , so what should i say ? we are just really sick , " she told @entity25 's @entity232 in a telephone interview			2
" the only thing i want to say , " she said , " is i want the whole world to hear that i love my son , my precious @entity235			0
" thousands of miles away , another mother -- @entity15 -- said her love for her own sons makes her want to learn more about @entity2 during the trial , to try to understand why the deadly attacks occurred			1
" i watch my sons , and it 's sad			0
their lives have changed , and they 're ok with it			0
they 've learned to accept it			0
but i ca n't , " she said , her voice cracking			0
" you know , those are my kids , and they went to watch a marathon on the streets of @entity111 , and it should n't have happened			0
" for @entity258 : $ 8.4 million of assistance			0
