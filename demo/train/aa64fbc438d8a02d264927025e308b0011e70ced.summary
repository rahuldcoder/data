-- let 's face it			0
tires are usually one of the most un-fun things to buy for a car			1
most of us are n't too concerned about the process			2
we 're just trying to buy a set of discount tires that turn out to be better than four pencil erasers			1
@entity13 found cheap tires by giving up 3 hours of his day and all dignity for his aging car			2
recently , i set out to buy some discount tires of my own			1
manned with my laptop and cell phone , i aimed to unearth the best discount tire deals on the @entity22			2
now , there are some big - name choices , such as @entity25 and @entity26			0
since i 've bought some discount tires online before , i knew the first place to look was @entity29			1
you can find tires for almost any car and get a really good deal			2
plus you can read surveys and reviews from customers who have bought the same tires you 're buying			2
six tire buying tips : 1			2
saving money on discount tires is great , but not at the expense of sacrificing traction or safety			1
know the factory size of your tires , usually found on the inside door hinge of the driver 's side			1
shop around for the best deals on discount tires by checking local and online stores			1
determine how long you 're going to need the tires and buy within your budget			1
know the factory warranties and shop guarantees for your tires before you purchase them			1
not all tires are created equal nor are the expensive ones always the best			0
since @entity29 is an online company and they do n't own any air wrenches themselves , you can search through a list of mechanic shops right on their web site who will accept your delivery of tires and will put them on the car for you at their designated price			1
when i ordered a set from @entity29 in the past , i got a set of good tires for a great price			1
they deliver through @entity80 and @entity81 , so there 's no guessing game on that front			0
@entity29 sometimes offers rebates and other special deals			0
although the site may have some of the cheapest prices online , it may also cause you to spend a little more than you anticipated			1
the price you 're quoted for a set of tires does not include the extra fill - in - the - blank you pay in order to have the tires shipped to you or your mechanic			0
in my case , the cheapest delivery charge was a @entity81 delivery that cost me $ 36			0
this was in addition to the several hundred i was already paying for the tires			0
depending on where you live , the charge for having tires delivered may vary , so make sure to confirm a three - day delivery as opposed to overnight if you want to keep costs down			0
the real problem came when i took my @entity29 tires to the local mechanic and was charged $ 90 for what they called a " basic tire package			1
" i 'd hate to see the deluxe version 's price			0
this was simply the mounting , balancing , disposal fees , parts and labor			0
if you want to go the @entity29 route , call some mechanics in your area before you take the tires there and find out which one has the best installation price			1
keep in mind that the bigger the tires and rim size , the more money it costs to have them mounted			1
tire rack can be a great choice for discount tires if you keep your shipping cost down and you find a cheap mechanic			1
altogether , i spent an extra $ 126 on top of the cost of the tires , but that did not outweigh the savings i was getting on the tires			0
little price , big pain at @entity148 if you 're simply looking for the best deal on discount tires , my advice is to go with the name synonymous with savings , @entity148			1
regardless of your feelings toward the franchise , you will get a good set of tires at a cheap price			0
my @entity148 experience was probably like most people 's normal shopping experience at the store : great deals mixed with rising blood pressure			1
one of the great advantages to buying discount tires through @entity148 is that you can order the tires online and have them sent to any one of their tire and lube stores for free			1
that 's right , free shipping			0
a couple months ago , i did just that			0
thinking i would try a different route to save money , i purchased my discount tires through @entity148 instead of @entity29			1
oh , and did i mention they mount your tires for free ? with free mounting and only $ 5 a tire to balance ( compared to $ 20 at my mechanic ) it 's hard to pass up that kind of savings			2
the problem i ran into with @entity148 was their customer service			1
when i asked how long it would take for everything to be completed , i was told an hour and half			0
i thought to myself , " i can kill an hour and a half in @entity148			2
where 's the electronics section ? " what i should have realized was that i was being quoted a time by a tire and lube service cashier clerk , not one of their mechanics			2
i periodically checked back every twenty minutes after the initial hour had gone by to see if they were through			0
three long cell phone conversations , two walks up and down just about every aisle in the store and almost three hours later , my car was finally ready			0
when i rounded the corner , i could see my car sitting in the parking lot , but something was wrong			0
i was in the middle of a cell phone conversation with my wife , complaining about my day wasted			0
i walked up to my car to see the finished product and could n't help but yell out mid-sentence , " and they put whitewalls on it ! " needless to say i did not ask for whitewall tires , nor did i want them			2
now that i could drive away at last , there was no way i wanted my car to go back into that garage to have those tires turned around			0
regardless of the waiting , the wailing and the whitewalls , i was able to buy four brand - name 80,000 - mile discount tires , shipped and installed for under $ 300			2
i 'm sure that i could have gotten the whitewall tires turned around with no problem from @entity148 's mechanics , but it was a personal decision based on how much more time it would have taken			1
i just want to let our readers know that sometimes you do pay for the best price			0
in my case , they charged me one perfectly good thursday afternoon and any dignity my 13 - year - old car was still clinging to			0
