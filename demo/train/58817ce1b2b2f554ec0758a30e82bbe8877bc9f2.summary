@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the wake of a series of court scandals , an influential @entity4 legal commission issued new guidelines this week asking for fairer due process in @entity1 's much maligned court system			1
the guidelines , released by the @entity12 , call for interrogations to be recorded to prevent torture , defendants to have access to their attorneys , and judges , prosecutors and police to have a " lifetime responsibility " for their roles on each case			0
" @entity1 has been full of scandals about wrongful convictions of innocent people , " says @entity24 , a senior researcher at @entity25			1
" i think this is a response by the government and party that knows its citizens hold its judiciary in pretty low regard			0
" on tuesday , a man who served 17 years of a life sentence for murdering his wife was freed after a @entity38 in @entity39 ruled that the " facts about the alleged homicide were unclear and the evidence inadequate , " state news agency @entity43 reported			0
this and many similar cases have draw outrage on social media in @entity1			1
" court cases in the past often deviate from regulations and were influenced by external causes , even though there has been clear regulations to guarantee defendants ' right , " says professor @entity48 of @entity49			2
@entity48 , a noted champion of legal reform , says courts do n't always follow regulations and the key test of reform will be implementation			2
many of the guidelines are not new			0
@entity1 's legislative body unveiled a new @entity65 in 2012 that aimed to give defendants more rights , but was criticized for increasing police power			1
rights groups regularly accuse @entity1 security organs of torture and forced confessions in criminal cases			1
a landmark study ( @entity76 in @entity1 : an @entity75 ) completed in 2011 found that 95 % of those accused in @entity1 confess to their crimes			1
the announcement of legal reforms appears to be part of a broader effort by president @entity85 's government			2
during a decade in power , @entity1 's previous president @entity86 put the brakes on legal reform seen in the years after the chaos of the @entity91 and in the wake of the @entity94 massacre in 1989			1
several prominent legal minds in @entity1 were ostracized or sidelined			1
but for a ruling party whose chief aim is holding onto power , popular anger at the legal system may have reached a threshold			2
many @entity1 , who see a legal system beset with corruption and frequently influenced by the powerful , will often turn to petitioning and protest			1
" there is clearly hope at the moment for momentum in legal reform , " says @entity24			2
" the leadership should understand that it 's in everyone 's best interest that the judiciary not only has a functional role , but is trusted by the people			1
" but for the ruling party , there are lines in the sand			0
" if you recognize the rule of law as the fundamental guiding principle and the constitution as the abiding rule in @entity1 , then what does that mean for party control ? " says @entity121 , a @entity1 expert at @entity122			1
@entity121 believes there is little chance the party will loosen its grip over the courts through fundamental reforms			0
" it would be a slippery slope towards greater and greater change that they may not be comfortable with , " he says			0
party members , numbering more than 80 million , are essentially above the law			0
if suspected of crimes , they are dealt with the party disciplinary committees first before going through criminal procedures , if at all , experts say			0
" there is a big discrepancy between the way @entity1 works on paper and how it works in practice , " says @entity121			2
left out of the new guidelines altogether are the way the party deals with perceived political threats			0
@entity24 says that in sensitive cases where the party feels threatened , torture , ill treatment and extracted confessions are the norm			0
he does n't expect that to change			0
" @entity1 has the toolbox to deal with people properly , but every single political case that i have worked on in a decade has been marked by extensive violations of procedure			1
