@entity0 -- with a population of 1.3 billion , you 'd think that there would be 11 people in @entity6 who are good enough to put up a fight on the football pitch			1
since 2002 , the last -- and only -- time it made it to the @entity12 finals , @entity9 has struggled internationally			1
a nadir came in june last year , when the side lost a home game 5 - 1 against a @entity17 side made up largely of youth team players			1
their sorry showing on the football pitch is cause for despair , ridicule and frustration			2
it 's not for lack of trying , however			2
imported pedigree it 's often considered an issue of leadership , with flashy , expensive foreign hires typically made to steer the national team			1
in 2011 , amid towering expectations , ex-real @entity35 legend @entity34 was appointed			0
he was tasked leading @entity6 to the @entity38 , but was instead sacked two years later , following that humiliation at the hands of the @entity41			1
with that result , it was considered that he 'd left the team worse off than when he started			0
to make matters worse , the @entity45 was then handed a $ 4 million severance package			0
others say it 's the national league that is to blame			2
trailing far behind @entity52 's top leagues in the popularity stakes , the @entity50 has again looked outside for help			2
in order to boost the profile -- and credibility , following a string of attendance - sapping scandals -- of the country 's national league , @entity62 , was recruited to boost @entity6 's footballing spirit			1
the former @entity65 and @entity66 star is the closest thing the sport has to royalty , and enjoys a fanatic following in the mainland ; it was hoped that some of his stardust would rub off on the @entity50			0
cash injections another recent push came in the form of the creation of the @entity78 , which claims to be the world 's largest sporting academy			2
property tycoon @entity81 , who owns @entity6 's most successful club , @entity82 , opened the school in late 2012 to incubate young football talent on a 167 - acre campus			1
despite these moves , industry insiders say @entity6 is a long way from making it back to the @entity12			1
disproportionately tiny pool " success in football is directly related to the population of football players , " says @entity90 , chairman of @entity91 , one of @entity94 's biggest sports networks			1
the club allows thousands of amateurs -- both @entity6 and expatriates -- to play the game every week			1
@entity90 has been in @entity6 , and playing football there , for 20 years			1
he is arguably one of the most invested people in the grassroots development of the sport there			2
he says that , statistically , one great footballer will emerge out of every 200,000 players			0
right now , @entity6 has anywhere between 7,000 and 50,000 kids involved in football , according to the @entity112			1
this compares to nearly four million in the @entity114			0
according to these calculations , " @entity6 is likely to have one quarter of a world - class player , " says @entity90			1
despite the enormous pool from which to select players , growing the footballing population is an huge task			1
the nation may be crazy about watching the game , but when it comes to playing it , there are hesitations			0
" it is n't just @entity6 , many countries in @entity135 do not have a football culture , " says @entity129 , an @entity130 former professional who , in 2012 , was appointed @entity131 for the @entity132 and @entity133			1
grassroots development he is currently developing a unique nationwide football program for kindergartens , which will be announced in the fall			2
he believes that pre-school kids as young as two years old can begin to become familiar with the game			0
@entity129 is often credited for making the @entity146 team the top @entity135 contender that it is today , and @entity6 football authorities hope that he will have a similarly positive impact			1
however , it takes more than just appointing coaches or bringing in top stars , he says			1
" the only way to really make a change is by empowering the kids and educating the parents			0
the best players in the world , such as ( @entity160 ) @entity160 or ( lionel ) @entity161 , they learned technical skills with no coach , " he says			0
" it 's not a secret that parents think of sport as a distraction to education			2
" not just about the sport he argues that youth involved in sport are more successful , and develop as more rounded , confident individuals			2
" we should n't convince people to play sport just to become professional , we should be focusing on sport as a lifestyle			0
" @entity90 agrees that kids are key			0
he says that the reach of elite football schools , such as @entity78 's new academy , is not sufficient to have the required impact			2
the coach imagines an ideal future where grassroots football takes off in @entity6 , with community - based football clubs in the @entity191 mold taking the lead			1
when he started it 13 years ago , his club was previously exclusively made up of expatriate children			2
now , with 3,000 kids on the books , 60 % of them are @entity6			1
the turning point , he says , was when parents realized that learning the sport would have other benefits			0
@entity90 used @entity203 language learning through playing football , as his foreign coaches would speak @entity203 to the budding footballers			0
parents , in turn , hope that the environment will help their little ones learn the international language faster			0
" when the kids start playing , they fall in love with the game , and parents see benefits not just of learning @entity203 , but also of coordination , fitness , teamwork , loyalty , " he says			0
he adds that he had a tough time convincing parents of the positives of football , which in @entity6 is associated with cheating and match - fixing			1
. green shoots of hope @entity227 and his nine - year - old son @entity228 have been with @entity91 for three years			0
" because of the one child policy , it is important for @entity228 to learn how to be with other kids and to learn team spirit , football can teach that , " says @entity227			0
" football has given him a lot of confidence			0
" his son , who is in grade three , is currently one of the top three students in his class			0
teen players should also be prioritized , says @entity243			0
he argues that more investment should be made at the bottom of the football hierarchy , instead of boosting only the top professional players			0
" the buzz right now should be around the @entity249 ( @entity249 ) under - 16 tournament , as this will put ( the team ) in the under - 17 @entity12 , and from there everything will fall into place			1
" it may end up being a little more complicated than that , but as @entity6 looks as if it 's finally ready to embrace change from the ground up , it may not be long until the @entity6 national team once again graces the biggest stage of all .			1

despite @entity6 's *massive* population , the country falls far short in terms of footballing prowess
authorities have tried to fix the *problem* by bringing in flashy stars and plowing money into club *facilities*
@entity275 *attracts* huge *tv* *audiences* -- especially around the @entity12
experts say the focus needs to be on youth development
