-- another week , another @entity2 provocation			1
it might seem an understandable reaction to news monday that @entity2 and @entity6 had exchanged hundreds of shells across their western sea border			1
the incident occurred a day after @entity10 had warned it was preparing to test another nuclear device , and just a week after it tested two medium - range ballistic missiles			0
but should the @entity13 greet such saber - rattling with a shrug of the shoulders ? after all , @entity18 capitals have been engaging in this " dance " for two decades , since the @entity20 took over as the country 's supreme leader			1
is this latest round of provocations under his son and successor , @entity28 , simply more of what we 've seen before ? not necessarily , argue some of those closely familiar with @entity2			1
they warn that under @entity28 's rule , @entity10 has shown an even greater willingness to raise the stakes , whether it be the multiple missile launches over the past several weeks , the way it stoked a crisis last spring when it announced it had ended the 1953 @entity41 and moved intermediate missiles to its east coast , or its warning that foreign companies and tourists in @entity6 should evacuate			1
@entity6 investigates two suspected @entity2 drones more recently , in the @entity50 intelligence community 's annual worldwide threat assessment , director of national intelligence @entity46 warned that @entity2 had " expand ( ed ) the size of its @entity53 enrichment facility and restart ( ed ) the reactor that was previously used for plutonium production " but was shut down in 2007			1
" the regime still acts in a very belligerent manner , but it seems less predictable , and more random , " said @entity57 , deputy envoy to @entity2 during the @entity59 administration			2
timeline : @entity2 nuclear program the younger @entity28 ( and young is the right word -- he is still only 31 ) took office in december 2011 , amid questions over how much control he really has over the levers of power , including the country 's military of more than 1 million people			1
since then , @entity2 has faced additional international sanctions after the launch of a long - range rocket in december 2012 , a move that it followed up with the country 's third nuclear test , in february 2013			1
" the timing and the intensity of @entity2 's provocations ( since @entity28 took office ) clearly demonstrates a high tolerance for risk , " said @entity80 , assistant director of the @entity6 chair at the @entity82			1
" since ( @entity28 ) took power he has purged almost all of his elder guardians ... and filled his surroundings with new faces			2
we are in a situation where we are learning about him a little bit every day through his unpredictable behavior and actions , which is why the current situation with @entity2 is a lot more dangerous than before , " she said			1
but @entity103 , coordinator of the @entity104 at the @entity105 , suggested this week 's exchange of live fire is not , on its own , too troubling			0
" @entity2 actually warned @entity6 in advance that they were going to carry out live - fire drills in seven locations			1
they advised the @entity6 to remove ships from the area			2
all of the shells fell in the water			0
no land or military installations were targeted , " @entity103 said			0
" this is comparatively a very mild provocation			0
" person said the latest incidents might reflect @entity2 frustration on a number of issues , not least the recent joint military drills between @entity6 and the @entity50 , which @entity103 described as the largest such exercises in two decades			1
but most important , @entity103 said , is concern in @entity2 over the pace of improved relations with @entity6 and the @entity50			1
all just guesswork ? of course , the most oft - stated problem with speculating on @entity2 intentions has been the claim that the information coming out of the country is just too limited to make any concrete assumptions			2
" there are no countries as closed as @entity2			2
its citizens are n't allowed to travel , and the few @entity2 officials who do go abroad are closely watched			2
you basically have to go back to @entity143 's @entity142 to find something similar , " @entity57 said			0
" this makes it difficult to collect even the most basic background information about what is going on , and recruiting espionage sources is very difficult			0
the regime is very good at preventing knowledge of its inner workings			0
" @entity6 captures a @entity2 fishing boat a troubling glimpse of what is going on inside @entity2 came with a @entity158 report released in february			1
in a 372 - page report , the @entity159 on @entity2 outlined claims of " extermination , murder , enslavement , torture , imprisonment , rape ... and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation			2
" " the gravity , scale , duration and nature of the unspeakable atrocities committed in the country reveal a totalitarian state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world , " the report stated			0
yet understanding the inner workings of the regime has proven a tougher nut to crack			0
this was evident in the speculation that swirled around the younger @entity28 when it became clear he was the most likely candidate to succeed his father ; media reports were full of chatter about whether @entity28 's time at a @entity190 boarding school , and his apparent love of basketball , were an indication that he might be more friendly toward the @entity13			1
@entity194 , @entity2 slam @entity158 human rights report indeed , according to a leaked cable published by @entity200 , @entity198 's intelligence community was said to have relied in part on the book of a former sushi chef for insights into the elder @entity28 's behavior			1
even @entity194 , the closest thing @entity2 has to a reliable ally , does n't fully understand the power struggle going on at the top of the @entity2 regime , suggested @entity211 , a leading @entity194 watcher and director of the @entity213 at @entity214			0
the gruesome execution in december of the younger @entity28 's influential uncle , @entity218 , for example , " caught @entity215 by surprise , " @entity211 said			2
but @entity103 suggested the supposed impenetrability of @entity2 might sometimes be overplayed			0
" while @entity2 has long defied close scrutiny , there is no void of knowledge about the country			0
we have much more information to call upon than most care to admit , " @entity103 said , adding that the @entity105 for one has spent years " assembling and translating the diplomatic record of @entity2 's former communist allies ... ( including ) thousands of conversations between @entity2 officials , including the supreme leaders , and foreign heads of state and diplomats			1
" the question confronting policymakers is whether the still inexperienced @entity28 has yet mastered the implications -- and relatively safe limits -- of the brinkmanship that was practiced for so long by his father			0
" @entity2 is signaling that they are not shutting the door			0
in fact , quite the opposite is true , " @entity103 said			0
" but this is a very slippery slope -- and could easily turn nasty			0
" @entity2 election provides clues to reclusive @entity247 state			0

tensions flare again between @entity2 , @entity6
experts say @entity13 should *pay* attention to @entity2 's saber - rattling
@entity28 is still young and his actions are difficult to predict , they say
