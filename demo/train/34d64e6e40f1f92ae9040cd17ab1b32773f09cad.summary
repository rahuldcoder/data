@entity0 -- a malfunctioning launch control center for a portion of the nation 's nuclear missiles remained offline wednesday as investigations continued into a weekend computer problem that disrupted communications with more than 10 percent of @entity10 's land - based nuclear missiles			1
early indications are that saturday 's disruption to one of the launch control centers linked to @entity16 in @entity17 lasted longer than an hour , lt. col. @entity11 said			1
the problem appears to be very similar to glitches at two other nuclear missile sites in the late 1990s			2
the @entity10 has 450 land - based intercontinental ballistic missiles in its nuclear arsenal			1
the @entity24 missiles involved in saturday 's incident are all currently at " normal operating capability , " said @entity11 , the director of public affairs for the @entity29 's @entity28			0
but while those missiles are typically controlled by five underground launch control centers , only four are currently online , he added			1
the fifth control center remains offline and is believed to be the source of a computer hardware problem that caused a communications disruption saturday			1
it has been electronically isolated from the launch system while the problem is investigated and solved , @entity11 said			0
it 's not unusual for a missile squadron to take one of its five launch control centers out of service to perform maintenance , @entity11 explained			1
in fact , he said , an entire squadron of missiles can be controlled by just one control center or even from a command aircraft flying nearby			2
@entity11 said that as soon as computer messages started telling the squadron commanders at @entity16 that a problem existed over the weekend , closed - circuit television security cameras were used to check each silo and make sure no obvious problems existed			2
then , @entity29 personnel from @entity58 were sent to all 50 silos , in a " not insignificant effort , " to visually inspect them and make sure they were secure			0
some of the missile silos are hundreds of miles from the base			0
the investigation is still going on , @entity11 said , but early indications are that a computer component on the fifth launch control center continually tried to communicate with the missiles in the silos when it was n't supposed to			1
he compared it to five people with walkie - talkies and one of them sitting on the button , making it impossible for the other four to use theirs			0
once the fifth launch control center was isolated , the other four established communications with all 50 missiles , and the squadron was back to normal , @entity11 explained			1
the process of isolating the problem and getting the other control centers linked back to the missiles took more than an hour , he said			2
because of redundancies in the nuclear force , several military officials have said , the president always had the ability to order the missiles to launch			2
as for the cause , @entity11 said it appears the computer hardware problem is very similar to problems in the late 1990s at the two other @entity29 bases that control @entity10 's intercontinental ballistic missile forces : @entity96 in @entity97 and @entity99 @entity98 in @entity100			1
the circumstances of those incidents were much like what happened at the @entity58 base , he said			0
the @entity29 and @entity105 , which would take charge of the missiles if the president were ready to launch them , is investigating the incident			0
@entity11 said that right now , investigators are " not ruling anything out			0
" but he said there is " no indication of intentional of malicious activity			0
" defense secretary @entity118 is monitoring those investigations closely , @entity117 spokesman @entity116 said .			0

one launch control center for the nation 's nuclear missiles is offline
the problem began over the weekend
the @entity10 has 450 land - based intercontinental ballistic missiles
