@entity0 -- a lawyer for @entity4 's family seemed satisfied as he left the @entity0 courthouse after the first week of the pop star 's wrongful death trial			1
" there 's a long way to go and we hope the evidence supports -- and we believe it does -- that @entity15 ( @entity14 ) @entity13 was unfit for the job he was hired to do , " attorney @entity8 said			2
" he was financially motivated and was in serious financial straits			0
" @entity4 's mother and three children are suing @entity20 , contending the concert promoter is liable in the pop icon 's death because it hired , retained and / or supervised @entity13 , the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter			1
@entity13 's fatal treatment of @entity4 with the surgical anesthetic the coroner ruled killed him was the result of the doctors ' financial desperation and pressure from @entity20 executives to have @entity4 ready for rehearsals for his comeback tour , @entity4 lawyers argue			1
@entity20 contends it was @entity4 who chose and controlled @entity13 , not its executives			2
the company had no way of knowing what treatments the doctor was giving the singer , who it said was an expert at keeping his " deepest , darkest secret " the trial 's first witness was a paramedic who arrived at @entity4 's home at 12:26 p.m. on june 25 , 2009 to find a man who he initially thought was a hospice patient who had died after a long illness			1
@entity4 lawyers see that description as support for their argument that @entity20 execs should have realized the frailty of @entity4 's health			1
@entity20 lawyer concedes : @entity4 is dead the second witness was the @entity59 detective who led the investigation of @entity4 's death			1
@entity62 arrived at court tuesday , wednesday and thursday wearing a black cowboy hat , which he said is not part of his uniform as a homicide investigator , but " the chief tolerates it			2
" the trial is off until monday , when the coroner 's toxicologist will give scientific testimony about the drugs found in @entity4 's body after his autopsy			1
the doctor who conducted the autopsy will follow on the witness stand			0
@entity13 's big debts when @entity20 first talked to @entity13 about working as @entity4 's tour doctor , he asked for $ 5 million for a year			1
court records and credit reports showed @entity13 was at least $ 1 million in debt , including delinquent taxes , defaulted student loans , unpaid child support and a defaulted mortgage			1
his @entity91 home , which had dropped in value by $ 500,000 , was in foreclosure and his medical clinic was being evicted from an office building , according to records introduced as evidence in the trial			2
@entity13 's chances of catching up financially became an achievable goal when @entity20 agreed to pay him $ 150,000 a month			1
before that , his monthly expenses totaled $ 2,700 more than his income , according to one document			0
@entity62 testified that he concluded this was a major incentive for @entity13 to " break the rules , bend the rules , to do whatever he needed to do to get paid			2
" @entity13 's heavy burden of child support payments was the result of his fathering eight children with seven women			1
@entity4 lawyers contend @entity20 could have at least run a credit check on @entity13 before giving him the responsibility of caring for @entity4			2
it should have been a red flag warning that he would put his paycheck above his @entity120			0
@entity13 's other lost patient the @entity4 death trial jury broke out into laughter at the oddest time thursday -- when @entity8 asked @entity62 about another @entity13 patient who died under his care			1
lawyer : ' @entity128 ' to come out at trial a @entity91 man called @entity0 police to tell them about how he thought @entity13 's negligence caused his father 's death			1
the man said he did n't file a medical malpractice suit because @entity137 law discouraged him			0
@entity8 : " you learned @entity13 was n't sued for malpractice , but he had killed someone else ? " ( the jury laughs			2
) @entity8 : " you learned that dr. @entity13 had caused the wrongful death of someone else ? " @entity62 : " yes			2
" @entity20 's lawyer brought out a document showing the coroner ruled the man 's death was from natural causes -- a heart attack			1
@entity62 also testified that @entity13 had been suspended from hospitals three times in the decade before @entity4 's death			1
the loss of hospital privileges in one case was because he failed to promptly respond to a phone call when he was on call			0
the others appeared to be based on failure to follow record keeping procedures			0
@entity162 ' ghost haunts @entity4 trial @entity4 lawyers will argue that a background check on @entity13 by @entity20 executives would have revealed these and served as red flag warnings that he should not be @entity4 's tour doctor			1
@entity20 lawyer will contend they had no way of knowing			0
' @entity171 ' policy only one of @entity176 's eight sons and daughters can sit with her in court at one time , the judge ruled this week			2
unlike in @entity13 's criminal trial when all of the @entity181 filled a courtroom bench at times , the family will have just two seats throughout the civil trial			1
the limit was imposed because all of the @entity181 -- with the exception of @entity190 -- are on @entity20 's witness list			0
@entity20 lawyers objected when they saw @entity193 and @entity194 sitting with their mother as the first witnesses testified			0
there is " a risk in allowing any of them in the courtroom , " an @entity20 lawyer argued			0
the risk is their own testimony would be influenced by hearing the testimony of others , she said			0
@entity8 successfully argued that at least one should be allowed to sit with their 82 - year - old mother , who plans to be in court each day -- except for the gruesome medical testimony about her son 's autopsy			2
" i think mrs. @entity176 should have at least one support person in the court room , " he said			2
the @entity181 star power could influence jurors who sit just a few feet away from them in the tiny courtroom			0
@entity218 intervention @entity20 lawyers plan to call @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity194 and @entity193 to testify about their failed attempts to intervene with @entity4 's drug addiction and their lack of knowledge about what was happening to him			1
only brother @entity229 is not on the defense witness list			0
@entity20 is trying to show that @entity4 was able to deceive even those close to him about his drug use , which helps their argument that executives with the concert promoter could not have known about it			0
the lawsuit contends that even if the executives did n't know about @entity13 's dangerous treatments , they should have			1
@entity176 told investigators that her family " attempted several interventions and she had spoken to her son about possible problems with drugs herself , " @entity62 testified thursday			1
" he denied having a problem			0
" an intervention at @entity4 's neverland ranch , organized by sister @entity219 , failed because " @entity4 did n't want to participate , " @entity62 said			1
messy bedroom the @entity0 mansion where @entity4 died was clean and neat , except for @entity4 's bedroom , according to @entity62			1
jurors saw police photos taken hours after the pop icon 's death , showing disorganized closets , cardboard boxes lining the hallway and a general mess throughout			1
@entity20 lawyer @entity264 spent several minutes questioning @entity62 about the messiness			0
during the lunch break , the @entity181 ' lawyer joked to reporters that @entity264 has succeeded in proving @entity4 was messy			2
back in court , @entity8 asked the detective : " is there anywhere in the penal code that says if you have a messy room that 's against the law ? " the jury thought that was funny and laughed			0
@entity8 : " you 've come across scenes that had a messy room ? " @entity62 : " yes			0
" @entity8 : " and that 's an indication that someone is not doing well , that their health is bad and they ca n't clean the room ? " @entity62 : " yes			0
" @entity8 : " there were moving boxes in the room ? " @entity62 : " yes			0
" @entity8 : " did you know he was planning to go to @entity291 ? within a week or two he was leaving that residence ? " @entity62 : " yes			0
" when @entity62 walked into the upstairs master bedroom , , he found the gas fireplace was burning , the television was on and music coming from the cd player			0
except for @entity13 , " only the chef who can drop off food at the door " was allowed upstairs , he testified .			0
