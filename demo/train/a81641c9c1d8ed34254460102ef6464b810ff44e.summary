-- an anarchist social worker raided by the feds wants his computers , manuscripts and pick axes back			1
he argues that authorities violated the @entity7 and the rights of his mentally ill clients while searching for evidence that he broke an anti-rioting law on @entity12			1
in a guns - drawn raid on october 1 , @entity14 agents and police seized boxes of dubious " evidence " from the @entity21 , @entity22 , home of @entity23			1
a @entity25 @entity24 in @entity26 has set a monday deadline to rule on the legality of the search , and in the meantime has ordered the government to refrain from examining the material taken in the 6 a.m. search			1
@entity23 , who counsels more than 100 severely mentally ill patients in @entity22 , seems to have first drawn attention from the authorities at september 's @entity38 gathering of world leaders in @entity40 , @entity41			1
there he was arrested on september 24 at a motel room for allegedly listening to a police scanner and relaying information on @entity12 to help protesters avoid heavily - armed cops -- an activity the @entity49 lauded when it happened in @entity50			1
a week later , the @entity51 , armed with a search warrant and backed by a federal grand jury investigation , raided @entity55 's house , which he shares with his wife of 13 years and several roommates			1
the squad seized his computers , camera memory cards , books , air - filtration masks , bumper stickers and political posters -- all purportedly evidence that the 41 - year old social worker had broken a federal anti-rioting law that carries up to five years in prison			1
but a closer look at the court documents leaves the unmistakable impression that @entity23 is yet another casualty of the government 's nasty , post- 9/11 habit of considering political dissidents as threats to national security			1
@entity23 , his wife and his lawyer @entity79 say the search violates the @entity7 's protections against general searches and prosecution for political speech			1
the police also seized mobile phones , citizen emergency kits , manuscripts , posters and even the couple 's marriage license			1
in a motion to throw out the search , @entity79 called the search unconstitutional : in this day and age , federally authorized agents entered the private home of a writer and urban planner and seized their books and writings			1
the warrant 's vagueness and lack of specificity encouraged the agents to use their own discretion and their own views of the political universe to seize , or not to seize , items which they thought were evidence of a violation of the federal anti-riot statute			1
the law and the @entity7 do not allow this			0
if there really is a grand jury investigation with possible future prosecution under [ a federal anti-rioting law ] , the use of this statute as applied to demonstrations , demonstrators , and their supporters has profound 1st amendment implications			0
if @entity23 were an @entity50 using @entity12 to coordinate government protests , he 'd likely be considered a hero in the @entity129			1
instead , the self - identified anarchist -- who volunteered in @entity131 after @entity132 -- is now facing up to five years in prison for each count a grand jury cares to indict him on			0
oddly , @entity55 was in jail during the most dramatic of the @entity38 confrontations			0
the day after his arrest by @entity140 state police on september 24 , hundreds of police officers chased protesters around the city , using sonic weapons , pepper spray , batons , projectile weapons and tear gas , and arrested a reporter and bystanders			0
some self - styled anarchists broke windows of chain stores and pushed a dumpster towards a phalanx of cops in riot gear			2
the connection between the federal and state investigation remains unclear , though the feds say they will turn evidence over to the state , if any is found			2
the affidavits justifying the raid remains under seal , but court documents reveal a grand jury is investigating whether @entity55 , and possibly his wife , violated 18 u.s.c. ยง 2101 , the federal anti-rioting law			2
that obscure law was famously used to prosecute the @entity172 7 after the @entity174 's police riot			1
five of the so - called @entity176 were initially found guilty of of inciting a riot , though the convictions were eventually thrown out			2
@entity23 and his wife both volunteered as paralegals for the @entity181 's @entity180 , their lawyer @entity79 said , and he 'd worked with them before defending protesters			1
in fact , he suggests that work might have sparked this entire incident			0
" if you do your job effectively , then you draw the government 's attentions , " @entity79 said			2
@entity55 also belongs to the " @entity192 , " which published a book called @entity194			0
the group was at work on a follow - up , until 50 copies of the first book and the electronic manuscript of the second were confiscated in the raid			0
on monday , @entity23 described the book in an affidavit to the court as a book of " political theory and practice			1
" the published book seems sympathetic to the tactic of confronting police and destroying property of companies considered harmful , usually -- though not always -- multinational companies			0
writing such a book is not a crime , though , and many of the other books cited by the police as evidence justifying the search after the fact can be bought on @entity222			1
@entity23 , who has no prior convictions , works as a counselor at a mental health facility			1
he says some of the records seized by the government include confidential information that should be covered by a shield law protecting mental health records			0
the @entity25 attorney 's office disputes that contention , saying the shield does n't apply since @entity55 is n't a registered social worker			1
moreover , the government says , @entity55 's house was chock full of incriminating materials , including gas masks , pickaxes and air - filtration masks			2
but @entity23 says that he 'd become a believer in civil defense after the 2003 blackouts in @entity22 and that the seized pickaxes are specialty , anti-sparking devices to be used in emergencies to shut off water mains			1
in fact , @entity23 and his wife told the court they 'd made a @entity254 video about what to put in a rescue pack			1
a review of the video by @entity258 confirms the pickaxe in the video matches the one seized by police			0
the government countered that his reading material is also very suspicious			0
" as an initial matter , the government notes that a publication entitled ' @entity269 ' was seized from the @entity271 ' bedroom , " the @entity25 attorney 's office told the court last week			2
some of the other evidence the feds seized that shows he promotes riots ? steampunk magazine , for one			2
@entity281 political - theory books			0
a needlepoint depiction of @entity283 that belonged to @entity23 's wife 's grandmother			1
( not surprisingly , the police do n't seem to grasp the irony of an anarchist owning a @entity283 bust in any form , given the hatred between the two ideologies since the @entity293 , when the @entity294 turned on the anarchists and murdered their ostensible allies			0
) his books on poison looks pretty incriminating , too			0
but his lawyer wonders why the police seized the poisons and @entity302 and left the book @entity304 : a writer 's guide to @entity301 , both of which he says @entity309 uses for his fiction writing			2
the feds also found caltrops -- four - pronged metal defensive weapons that always land with a pointy side up , used to give flat tires or hobble horses			0
neither @entity23 nor his attorney has mentioned them in their filings			1
they are not illegal to own			0
when the feds also found nine packages of fireworks at the rear of a closet , a @entity51 agent took him downtown to book him for the infraction -- a ticketable offense			0
the bomb squad took care of the fireworks , which one supposes must have been impervious to dousing by a regular police officer			0
federal agents also seized camera memory disks , @entity55 's journals , computers and hard drives			2
these contained his fiction manuscripts , his wife 's urban planning work and other writings			2
the police also confiscated a housemate 's laptop that belonged to the @entity348			2
how did all of this get taken ? does n't a search warrant have to specify what exactly is to be seized ? according to the @entity25 attorney 's office , the warrant was legitimate			1
signed by @entity357 on september 26 , it authorized the government to seize : computers , hard - drives , floppy discs and other media used to store computer - accessible information , cellular phones , personal digital assistants , electronic storage devices and related peripherals , black masks and clothing , maps , correspondence and other documents , financial records , notes , ledgers , receipts , papers , photographs , telephone and address books , identification documents , indicia of residency and other documents and records that constitute evidence of the commission of rioting crimes or that are designed or intended as a means of violating the federal rioting laws , including any of the above items that are maintained within other closed or locked containers , including safes and other containers that may be further secured by key locks ( or combination locks ) of various kinds			1
the list of what was taken stretches pages			0
the @entity402 ' lawyers are trying to overturn the search on the grounds that the warrant was n't specific enough to pass constitutional muster			2
they also argue the feds have no business collecting the names of people @entity411 communicated with , and that records from the @entity181 's @entity180 , as well as his work notes , are protected under confidentiality rules			2
but the @entity416 defended the search in court , arguing that the broad search was just like those used in drug warrants , which were increasingly broadened over the last quarter century 's ill - fated @entity423			1
the affidavits that supported the search warrant are under court seal , because the grand jury investigation is " complex and multi-state , " according to the prosecution			0
the federal anti-rioting statute is serious business , and is seemingly easy to violate			0
for instance , it is a felony to " organize , promote , encourage , participate in , or carry on a riot ; or [ ... ] to aid or abet any person in inciting or participating in [ ... ] a riot			0
" by that token , simply telling a person fleeing cops with batons which way to run makes you a felon			0
one wonders how the @entity444 and @entity443 would have fared under that law , when he was in a @entity447 jail , writing letters urging people to support the direct - action program of sit - ins and marches			0
those protesters were later attacked by police using dogs and fire hoses on the orders of @entity447 sheriff @entity458			0
a spokesman for the @entity22 @entity25 attorney 's office , @entity462 , declined to comment on the matter , citing rules forbidding officials to speak about grand jury investigations			0
