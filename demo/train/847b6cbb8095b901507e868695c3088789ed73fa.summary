@entity0 , @entity1 -- nobody ever said clinching a land speed record would be easy			1
@entity5 knew that when he started going for the spot in racing history 's record book that had always eluded his father , @entity9 , the famous @entity9			1
@entity5 was ready for @entity11 at the @entity0 in @entity1			1
he 'd taken his streamliner , @entity13 , up to 317 mph at trials			1
he 'd added some engine power and now he was restless , itching for his turn at the starting line			2
@entity11 was to be the first of several testing grounds as @entity5 pushed his little metal " cigar on wheels " past 400 mph , past 450 mph , maybe even past 500 mph			1
he knows she 's fast			2
he just does n't know how fast yet			2
and then it started to rain			0
on saturday , racing officials announced that the 2014 @entity11 -- the 100th at @entity0 -- was canceled			1
the salt is riddled with puddles and just too soggy for racing			0
the letters cancelled apeard in big capital letters on the @entity33 's website , along with this advisory : " the @entity35 is currently on the salt , and has determined that the standing water will not dry in time for us to hold our annual @entity11 event			1
" for @entity5 , who is 64 , it was 1968 all over again			1
that was the year his dad was going to snag the record until the rains turned the salt flats into a lake			2
" it 's @entity48 vu , " he told @entity2 , which has followed his journey to @entity0			1
" it 'll dry out			0
we 're not giving up			0
it 's just a little hitch in the giddy - up			0
" what drives @entity5 ? @entity5 was just a kid when his dad , @entity54 , became the first @entity55 to go faster than 400 mph at @entity0			1
that was in 1960 , when @entity9 clocked 406.6			0
but to enter the official record books , a driver has to make the return trip along the 7 - mile course within an hour , and the average of the two speeds is taken			1
@entity63 broke down on the return trip			2
@entity9 's second car , which he called the @entity65 or " flying needle , " clocked 411 mph during a test run in 1968			2
@entity9 knew this car was fast : " on the right course , in the right conditions , i 'm certain my car will run 500 mph , " he told @entity70 magazine at the time			2
" i look forward to driving it at 500			0
" but the flying needle never ran at @entity0			1
the rain saw to that , and the streamliner went into storage that november			0
sponsors moved on to other projects and it was all but forgotten			0
two decades later , @entity9 approached his son about going for the speed record at @entity0			1
@entity9 was pushing 60 by then , and @entity5 was in his 30s			1
but @entity9 , who had been fighting in court with a former business partner , was gunned down in his driveway just weeks later			0
for a while , it seemed as if the dream died with him			0
but about four years ago , @entity5 decided to go for it			1
he cashed in everything he owned , sold off a couple of @entity9 's old cars , and started work on challenger 2 in a garage in @entity97 , @entity98			0
this was going to be his year			0
still could be , if it ever stops raining			0
" it cost us 20 grand to come up , " he said , disappointed that he did n't get to run the @entity13 , but far from discouraged			1
" we 'll just have to find more money and come back up here			0
" the @entity33 board is talking about extending its next event , @entity107 , from september 30 to october 3 to make up for lost time during @entity11			1
@entity5 has come this far			2
people who know him say he 's unstoppable now			0
@entity111 's web site for updates @entity5 is philosophical , pointing out that it took the current land - speed record holder , @entity115 , 10 years to get there in his @entity117			1
even then , the needle has has n't moved very far in half a century -- from @entity9 's 406.6 to @entity115 's 439 mph			2
" any study of the history of land speed racing reveals it is an endeavor fraught with difficulties and frustrating disappointment , " a friend posted on @entity5 's @entity121 page on friday night			1
he continued , " it certainly wo n't be easy , and there may be real moments of drama			0
but @entity131 , like a whole lot of people , believe in @entity5 and his dream			2
and it 's become our dream , too			0
when you shake his hand , you can know you 're not wasting your time			0
he is a true champion ... now go get what you came for			0

@entity5 hoped to break land speed record for *piston* engine
@entity11 at @entity0 was canceled saturday because of bad weather
@entity5 vows to return with @entity13 , which he built
he is the son of the first @entity55 to break the 400 mph mark
