@entity0 -- twelve ordinary people , some too young to remember when @entity3 and @entity4 were @entity6 's golden couple , will now decide who owns an @entity9 portrait of the iconic blond beauty			1
@entity9 painted two portraits of @entity3 in 1980 , after her breakout role on the tv hit series " @entity14 " made her @entity16 's " @entity15			1
" the question before the jury of six men and six women : did @entity9 give one portrait to @entity4 -- the @entity23 - nominated star of " @entity24 " -- or did he give them both to @entity3 ? the actress , who was 62 when she died of cancer in 2009 , left all her artwork to the @entity29 , where she studied before being discovered by @entity6			1
the university , which already has one of the portraits , is suing @entity4 for the other			1
he is countersuing for a tablecloth covered with hearts and signed by @entity9			2
a portrait of the final days of @entity3 jurors received the case at 2:40 p.m. pt monday after hearing closing arguments from attorneys for both sides			1
the disputed portrait hangs over @entity4 's bed in his @entity45 beach house			2
he removed it from @entity3 's @entity0 condo a few days after she died , with permission from her estate 's trustee			2
@entity51 , a lawyer for the university , asked jurors to honor @entity3 's wishes as expressed in a will leaving the university " all artwork and objects of art. " he alleged that @entity4 helped himself to the @entity9 after learning she had left him nothing			1
" @entity3 decided to leave all of her artwork to the @entity29			1
we did n't even know about it			0
they 're trying to get you to make @entity4 a beneficiary of her trust			2
" please , please speak for @entity3 because she ca n't speak for herself , " @entity51 urged			1
but @entity4 's lawyer , @entity69 , countered that the university was being greedy			1
he told jurors that @entity3 's original artwork still sits unseen in storage " in some basement catacomb			2
" the @entity9 the university received after her death was n't shown publicly until earlier this year , he added			1
" this is an important case for @entity4			2
this is not just a lawsuit about a painting			0
this painting has been in his life for more than 30 years			0
@entity3 was the love of his life , " @entity69 said			2
" i hope that everyone here that is entrusted with this decision will not allow the @entity29 to take this portrait away from him			2
" @entity69 pointed out that half a dozen witnesses corroborated @entity4 's story that @entity9 made two portraits -- one for each of them			1
" use your common sense , " he said			1
" why would @entity3 want two ? " @entity4 received support on monday from a surprise courtroom visitor , @entity3 's " @entity14 " co-star @entity97			1
" i think the most important thing is to imagine how @entity3 would feel right now , " @entity97 told reporters outside court			2
" as her good friend who 's known her way before ' @entity14 , ' i really feel @entity3 would want that portrait with @entity4 and then on to ( their son ) @entity104			1
" it 's her soul , it 's her eyes , it 's her hair , it 's everything she is			0
i always described @entity3 as this 8x10 glossy -- you know , the combination of this beautiful girl and the girl next door			2
and that portrait captures that			0
" dramatic testimony @entity9 , who died in 1987 , was a pop artist who rubbed elbows with -- and churned out portraits of -- the famous and fabulous			1
all together , his artwork has fetched $ 1.7 billion at auction , second only to @entity120			0
the average price for an original @entity9 is now $ 7.8 million , according to testimony			2
an appraiser for the university compared the @entity3 portrait to those @entity9 painted of @entity126 and @entity127 and estimated its worth at $ 12 million			1
but an appraiser for @entity4 set its worth far lower , comparing it to @entity131 of @entity132 and @entity133 and suggesting it would fetch $ 1 million at auction at most			2
@entity4 , 72 , provided the dramatic highlight of the three - week trial when he was asked what the portrait meant to him			2
" i talk to it			0
i talk to her , " he said , his voice quaking with emotion			0
" it 's her presence in my life and her son 's life			0
it would seem a crime to lose it			0
" @entity4 : i talk to @entity3 's portrait @entity155 testified about seeing both portraits in his parents ' homes over the years , but he was not permitted to tell jurors what it meant to him and his father			1
later , outside the courthouse , he reluctantly told reporters what he 'd hoped to say on the witness stand			0
" this portrait is a family heirloom , " the younger @entity4 said			2
" it has no money value to me			0
it 's to stay in the family			0
it 's a beautiful remembrance of my mom , and it belongs where it is			0
" @entity3 studied art at the @entity29 in the late 1960s before a summer job led to roles in commercials			1
she posed in a red tank swimsuit for a poster that sold 12 million copies and was cast in 1976 in " @entity14			0
" she met @entity4 in 1979 and embarked on a tumultuous 30 - year romance with a bad - boy heartthrob known equally for his charm and volatile temper			0
@entity4 , who starred with @entity189 in the steamy 1960s prime - time soap " @entity191 " and with @entity192 in the 1970 tearjerker " @entity24 , " testified that he persuaded @entity3 to pose for @entity9 in 1980 soon after the actors began seeing each other			1
a producer for the tv news magazine " 20/20 " testified for the university that she introduced @entity9 and @entity199 at a book party in @entity201			2
she said she saw no sign of @entity4 at the party or at @entity9 's @entity205 studio , known as @entity206 , when @entity3 sat for the portrait			1
the show was doing a segment on @entity9 at the time			0
@entity4 said he was at both the party and the studio , and that @entity9 painted the hearts on the tablecloth at the party			1
indeed , the tablecloth is dedicated to @entity3 and " @entity215 , " and the words " @entity201 " are written in a semicircle			0
breakup and reconciliation the portrait in dispute wound up in @entity3 's possession after she walked in on @entity4 in bed with another , much younger , woman in 1997 at the @entity45 beach house			1
@entity4 said he gave the portrait to @entity3 for safekeeping after his " young friend " complained she felt " uncomfortable " with " @entity3 staring down at her			1
" other witnesses said @entity3 took anything bearing her likeness from the beach house in the wake of the breakup			0
after 1998 , according to testimony , the portrait was seen in the guesthouse of @entity3 's @entity240 home and at a @entity0 storage facility			0
during the final years of her life , it hung outside her bedroom in her @entity246 condominium			0
the other portrait -- the one now hanging at the university 's @entity248 -- hung in her living room			0
@entity4 : @entity9 portrait of @entity3 ' is mine ' @entity4 said @entity3 forgave him and they reconciled in 2001 after he was diagnosed with leukemia			1
although they never married , he and other defense witnesses said they were a couple and shared quarters at her condo and his beach house , and that he cared for her until she died			0
@entity3 set up a living trust before her death , leaving all her artwork to her alma mater			0
she left more than $ 4 million to the couple 's son , @entity104 , but nothing to @entity4 , according to testimony			0
superior court judge @entity267 ruled that the case had nothing to do with @entity3 's intentions			0
instead , he instructed jurors to focus on who owned the disputed @entity9			0
it is not an easy question to answer since the artist gave the portrait as a gift , both @entity3 and @entity4 have insured it , and it has never been sold -- a point underscored by the correspondence between lawyers for the university and @entity3 's trustee : " in light of the unusual relationship and living arrangement between ms. @entity3 and mr. @entity4 and in light of the fact the @entity9 works were not purchased , it may be impossible to ' prove ' the ownership of the works in question by the kind of documentary evidence we lawyers like , " said one letter to the university from the trustee 's attorney			1
the @entity9 story both warhols of @entity3 are 40 - inch by 40 - inch silkscreens of enlarged @entity303 photographs on canvas			1
nearly identical , they show @entity3 in three - quarter profile , with her eyes painted a vibrant greenish blue and her lips a shiny red			0
@entity4 testified that @entity9 agreed to make one portrait for him and one for @entity3 , and that the artist handed one to each of them after they were completed			1
over the years , the couple repeated the story to friends , several of whom testified in @entity4 's defense			0
@entity4 and those friends told the story in court , and they said @entity3 never disputed @entity4 's account			1
the @entity29 ' witnesses included a reality show producer who worked with @entity3 on the @entity326 series " @entity3 " and a documentary about her fight with cancer			1
@entity330 testified that @entity3 never forgave @entity4 and never intended for him to have the portrait			1
@entity332 , a former college boyfriend , and @entity334 , a former personal assistant , also supplied information to the university and testified on its behalf			0
@entity4 's lawyers , @entity69 and @entity340 , portrayed the three men as hangers - on with axes to grind against @entity4			0
they presented testimony from @entity4 , as well as @entity3 's inner circle of friends , including hairstylist @entity346 and @entity347 , the former wife of actor @entity349 and rocker @entity350			1
@entity350 , who said @entity3 was her best friend , said she always considered the second @entity9 to be @entity4 's			1
at one point , according to testimony , @entity3 told another friend that there were just five people in the world she could really trust			0
she did not name any of the university 's witnesses , but @entity346 , @entity350 and @entity4 made the list .			2

attorneys for @entity29 , @entity4 give closing arguments
" please speak for @entity3 because she ca n't speak for herself , " university lawyer says
" use your common sense , " @entity4 lawyer says . " why would she want two ? "
