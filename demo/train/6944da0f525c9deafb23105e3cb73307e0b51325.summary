-- @entity1 remembers the moment he called @entity3 and asked him to make his first @entity5 concert appearance in 12 years on june 9th , for the drummer 's late - night @entity6 at @entity8			1
" i said , ' it will be a whole night doing what we used to do at @entity12 in the @entity13 , ' " @entity1 tells @entity0			1
" ' playing the @entity19 catalog and seeing what we get , the @entity16 catalog , @entity17 , the @entity14			2
' he said , ' go ahead			2
' and once he said , ' go ahead , ' i was like , ' i got you now			2
' " during the live jam session , @entity3 surprised the crowd by grooving with @entity19 singer @entity25 during a funky cover of the @entity28 ' " @entity27 " and shredding guitar on @entity17 's " @entity30			1
" " he 's elated , " @entity1 says			1
" he was just amazed			2
i wanted him to see how loved he really is because he really does n't get it			2
he seriously does n't watch television			2
he 's not on a computer at all			2
he 's still listening to vinyl , cassettes and a discman			0
" @entity38 drummer hopes the appearance will convince @entity3 to finally release his first lp since 2000 's " voodoo			1
" @entity1 says roughly 30 tracks have been recorded over the last few years , with many sessions taking place at @entity12 in @entity45 , where the singer cut @entity41			1
" he is about to take a radical 180 turn with this record , " says @entity1			1
" it 's going to throw people off the same way that @entity16 's @entity53 threw his @entity55 fanbase off			0
in the past few years , he 's discovered @entity56 and @entity57 , the @entity28 , @entity58 , captain @entity59 and @entity60			1
" my whole reasoning for doing [ @entity8 ] , " @entity1 says , " was to show him who his real audience is			1
" on the upcoming album , fans will also hear a new side of the singer : as a guitarist			0
" i saw a guitar in the studio , and i was like , ' what the hell 's this ? ' " @entity1 remembers			1
" one night , when he did n't know i was watching , he took a dinner break from recording			0
suddenly , i heard [ @entity19 's ] ' @entity77 ' playing			0
i realized he was in the studio room matching it note - for - note			0
for the last 12 years , he 's been strumming the guitar ... he is so painfully shy about it			1
i think in his head , if he does n't surpass @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity60 as an axeman , he does n't want to share it with the world			0
" @entity3 has also been creating his own keyboard sounds for the album			1
" he 's very particular about his patches , " @entity1 adds			1
" i 've never heard these sounds before			0
he 'll take an ordinary sound and he 'll filter it through a guitar processor			0
he 'll take that particular sound and put some wave envelope noise on it , and he 'll put it back in the keyboard , and that 's his sound			0
there 's a song we worked on called ' @entity105			0
' there 's this symphonic trombone sound , which normally would be a cheesy sound @entity108 uses			0
but he 'll take that sound and then put it through a guitar filter and put it back in the keyboard and then put it through another filter			0
" fans should expect to hear some of the new songs during an appearance at @entity119 @entity118 on july 6th			2
@entity1 says the goal is to release the lp around august			1
" nothing is official --- it is year 12 , " he laughs			2
" i 'm just hoping that this was enough fire to really make him do that			0
because we spoke the day after [ @entity8 ] and he said , ' i 'm so happy			1
' i said , ' now you just turn in your damn record			1
let your children go already			0
