@entity3 , 37 , told him about an e-mail she received on friday from the @entity30 ' @entity29 that included a proposed court order that would send her two children to live with her mother in @entity36			0
" the proposed court order was the nail in her coffin , the thing that sent her over the edge , " @entity22 said			1
the @entity30 agency declined to comment on the case , citing confidentiality laws			0
" when we take children into our care , reunification with the biological parents is always our goal , " spokeswoman @entity43 told @entity1			1
" sometimes it 's not safe and we can not			1

the order would send the boys to their maternal grandmother , with whom @entity3 had fought for custody of her older son for five years , he said			1
