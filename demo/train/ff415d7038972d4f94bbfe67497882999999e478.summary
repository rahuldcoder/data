@entity0 come in all varieties , shapes and sizes , some big and some small			0
and one downright gigantic , apparently now swimming in a river in @entity6			1
that 's the fish story being told by @entity10 , who reeled in a 280 - pound ( 127 - kilogram ) , 8.75 - foot - long catfish last thursday along the @entity8 , said @entity11 , who is with @entity13 's sponsor company @entity12			1
( the sponsored fisherman would n't say exactly where he caught the big fellow , choosing to keep his favorite spots secret			2
) assuming the world is n't being hooked , this would not be the first time someone has caught a whopper of a catfish and lived to tell the tale			2
in fact , it would n't be the biggest catfish ever caught			2
that would be a nearly 342 - pound lau - lau ( or piraiba ) type of catfish snared in 2009 in @entity32 's @entity31 , according to the @entity33			1
@entity35 , it 's not even the biggest catfish ever snared in @entity6			1
that honor goes to a 298 - pound wels catfish -- which is reportedly the same variety caught by @entity13 -- also from the @entity8			1
and @entity13 did n't necessarily bring his fish in alone , with stories linked from @entity12 's @entity43 page indicating that twin brother @entity44 was by his side			0
one thing that makes the latest @entity8 catch unique is that it was done with a spinning reel , said @entity11 , who called it a record for such fishing tackle			0
it took @entity13 40 minutes to bring in the fish , then bring it to shore , his sponsor said			1
once it was on land , the @entity54 snapped some photos and weighed their catch			0
but they did n't dig in , savoring it with fresh bread , cheese and a glass of pinot grigio			0
that 's because this fish story has a happy ending for the star of the show : the catfish			2
according to @entity11 , @entity13 released his big catch back into the river			0
teen hooks massive blue marlin off @entity76 coast			0

@entity10 snaps photos of a 280 - pound catfish he says he caught in @entity6
it took him 40 minutes to reel in the fish , according to his sponsor
