-- he 's unlikely to break a world record or even win a medal but @entity5 's @entity4 is likely to generate plenty of headlines if he gets to february 's @entity8			1
the speed skater is currently the only openly gay athlete who could compete in @entity11 , at a games already tinged by @entity14 's controversial laws on homosexuality			1
the june ruling prohibits the distribution of information to minors promoting same - sex relationships and the public discussion of gay rights , but @entity4 has promised not to shy away from the issue			1
instead , he 's planning to tackle it head on			0
and if @entity14 president @entity27 , who signed off the bill , is sincere when recently saying that all competitors will be welcome -- " regardless of nationality , race or sexual orientation " -- then the 28 - year - old 's potential arrival will be the acid test			1
especially if he starts wearing the rainbow badge that has been made especially for him , one bearing the words " @entity4 -- proud 2014 "			1
" i will express my feelings and emotions openly ( in @entity11 ) , " the @entity37 told @entity0			1
" i am not going to go back into the closet in any way			0
i am proud of who i am			0
" yes , @entity11 is about my competitive nature -- it 's about me competing as a speed skater -- but on the other hand , it 's about standing up for what i believe in and being proud of that			1
" @entity4 came out after competing at the last @entity8 , saying he had chosen not to do so beforehand in order to avoid unwanted distractions in his build - up			1
in @entity51 four years ago , he reached the quarterfinals in the men 's 1000m short - track event -- and he will soon find out if he has qualified for the 500m at next year 's games			1
another reason given for not coming out prior to the @entity55 was a reluctance to alienate sponsors and in august , @entity4 launched an online campaign to generate funds for his @entity11 participation			1
this was predicated upon a desire to represent the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) community , with the @entity37 explaining in a promotional video that " love is a human right " and decrying the fact that the act of same - sex couples holding hands in @entity14 could lead to a jail term			2
he has also produced a badge that he will sell to raise funds for his participation and which he intends to wear in @entity14 , despite the punishments that could come his way			1
" the idea behind the pins is about showing a part of me that i am very proud to be , " explained a man who lives and trains in the @entity81 city @entity82			0
" in my mind , it is no different to ( sporting ) a cross or a cultural tattoo			0
the pin is something i can wear to show that i am proud of who i am and also offer solidarity to the people of @entity14 , because it is not fair what is happening to them			1
" i am in their country , i should respect that but i respect them , because they are the ones who are being oppressed -- and they are the ones who are having to hide who they are and having to live their lives in a way that is n't healthy			2
" in august , @entity112 issued a report on the anti-gay " propaganda " law and on the state of lgbt rights in @entity14 called " @entity118			2
" since 2006 , it says , 10 regional legislative bodies have adopted laws prohibiting the " propaganda " of homosexuality but those laws have seldom been applied			0
it also reports that during the first half of 2013 there were 13 beatings and one murder " motivated by anti-gay bias			0
" in 2012 , there were 12 attacks ; in 2011 , three			0
on a visit to inspect @entity11 's facilities in september , the @entity133 ( @entity133 ) dismissed concerns over the bill			2
" as long as the @entity138 is respected , we are satisfied			0
this is the case , " said @entity139 , who headed up the visiting @entity133 delegation			0
there have been widespread calls for a boycott of the @entity145 in light of the anti-gay laws , but @entity4 takes a very different view			2
" i think being @entity11 is a good thing -- not just for me but for this human rights movement , " he said			2
" it 's something that should n't be there , and the fact that it came into law in 2013 is absurd			0
" i do n't know what they were thinking nor what the intent is behind this			0
it makes no sense to me			0

openly gay speed skater @entity4 says he will stand up for his beliefs in @entity11
@entity165 intends to wear rainbow - themed badge at games if he qualifies
