-- @entity2 and @entity3 will dominate the mobile operating system market by 2014 , research firm @entity1 said friday			1
@entity1 expects that @entity2 and @entity3 together will account for 59.8 percent of the total worldwide mobile os market by 2014 , split almost equally -- @entity2 with 30.2 percent , and @entity3 with 29.6 percent			1
@entity3 is already closing the gap with the market leader			0
by the end of 2010 , @entity1 says , @entity8 's @entity3 will sneak into second place behind @entity11 - backed @entity2 with 17.7 percent market share , compared to @entity2 's 40.1 percent			1
at the end of 2009 , @entity3 had just 3.9 percent market share , the research firm reported			1
@entity1 's predictions do n't bode well for @entity17 's @entity16 and @entity19 's @entity18			1
those platforms , which ended 2009 with 19.9 percent and 14.4 percent of the market , respectively , are expected to take the third and fourth spots this year			0

@entity26 will trail far behind with just 4.7 of the market			0
but by 2014 , when @entity2 and @entity3 will be soaring , @entity1 expects @entity16 to have just 11.7 percent of the mobile market and @entity18 to own 14.9 percent			1
@entity1 thinks @entity2 will still lead the mobile market in 2014 due to " @entity11 's volume and the push into more mass - market price points			2
" @entity3 's success can be attributed to " communication service providers ' marketing and vendor support , " @entity1 said			2
the research firm 's findings echo what fellow market researcher @entity38 announced earlier this week			2
@entity38 likewise said that @entity3 will take the second spot behind @entity2 in 2014 , but it pegged @entity3 's worldwide market share at 24.6 percent , compared to @entity2 's 32.9 percent			2
it also believes that @entity19 's @entity18 platform will be lower than @entity1 's predictions , capturing 10.9 percent of the worldwide market in 2014			1
@entity17 's @entity16 will have 17.3 percent of the mobile market in 2014 , @entity38 predicted			1
of course , four years is a long time			0
nowhere is that more evident at the moment than at @entity11			0
late thursday night , the company announced that it is appointing @entity51 , president of @entity53 's @entity52 , as its new ceo			0
