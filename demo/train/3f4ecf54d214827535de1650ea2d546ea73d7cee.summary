-- years of aiming missiles at people on the other side of the world left @entity5 a broken man			0
in an interview with the magazine @entity8 , @entity5 recounts some of the grisly scenes he watched unfold on his monitor as an @entity12 drone operator			1
in grimly vivid detail , he talks about the first time he killed somebody , in early 2007			1
he was sitting in a control station on an air force base in @entity18			1
his three victims were walking on a dirt road in @entity21			0
after the hellfire missile fired from the drone struck the three men , @entity5 watched the aftermath on his infrared display			1
" the smoke clears , and there 's pieces of the two guys around the crater			0
and there 's this guy over here , and he 's missing his right leg above his knee , " he says in the article in the november issue of @entity8			2
" he 's holding it , and he 's rolling around , and the blood is squirting out of his leg , and it 's hitting the ground , and it 's hot			0
his blood is hot , " @entity5 says			0
" but when it hits the ground , it starts to cool off ; the pool cools fast			0
it took him a long time to die			0
i watched him become the same color as the ground he was lying on			0
" drone program in spotlight @entity5 , 27 , has talked about his experiences before -- to the @entity57 magazine @entity56 and to the @entity60 broadcaster @entity58			1
but the publication of his interview with @entity8 comes amid renewed questions about the human cost and the legality of the @entity60 drone program			1
@entity60 officials say the program is a vital tool in the fight against militant groups such as @entity72			1
but two international human rights groups raised serious concerns tuesday about the consequences of drone strikes in @entity77 and @entity78 , suggesting some attacks in recent years might amount to war crimes			1
@entity81 and @entity82 released reports giving detailed accounts of a number of attacks they say the @entity60 carried out in each of the two countries , resulting in the deaths of scores of civilians			1
the reports drew from extensive field research -- including interviews with witnesses and relatives of victims -- and called for a series of measures to bring the program in line with international law			0
leaders to meet the @entity104 on tuesday disputed the reports ' assertions that drone strikes had broken the law			2
but the situation was made all the more awkward by the presence in @entity111 of @entity77 prime minister @entity112 , who held talks with @entity60 president @entity114 on wednesday			1
after the meeting , @entity112 said he had raised the issue of drones with @entity114 , " emphasizing the need for an end to such strikes			1
" in remarks a day earlier at the @entity122 in @entity111 , @entity112 outlined some of the @entity77 government 's objections to the drone program			1
" recently our political parties in a national conference declared the use of drones is not only a continued violation of our territorial integrity but also detrimental to our resolve at efforts in eliminating terrorism from our country , " he said			2
' @entity137 ' @entity5 's interview gives a different perspective on the drone program			1
the @entity8 article provides a detailed study of his time as a drone operative , his decision in 2011 to quit and the post-traumatic stress disorder that followed			1
@entity5 says that during his time monitoring drones ' cameras and aiming its laser targeting system , he became numb and carried out the job in " zombie mode			1
" when he left the @entity12 in the spring of 2011 -- after nearly six years -- he says he turned down a $ 109,000 bonus to continue operating the drones			1
he was given a document totaling the number of people killed in missions in which he 'd participated in some form during close to 6,000 hours of flight time			0
the overall number of 1,626 , he says , " made me sick to my stomach			0
" a ' critical ' role looking back , he tells @entity8 , he would feel " horrible " living under a sky in which drones hover , watching and sometimes killing			2
but he says that when he started the job , he believed that the remotely piloted aircraft could help save lives			2
the @entity170 has repeatedly argued that they prevent the deaths of @entity60 soldiers and protect the nation from terrorism			1
@entity5 talks of efforts by drone crews to help @entity60 troops avoid harm and of atrocities he saw committed by militants			1
he says he watched on his screen as an insurgent commander pulled two girls out of the trunk of his vehicle in a crowded marketplace in @entity188			0
" they were bound and gagged , " @entity5 tells the magazine			2
" he put them down on their knees , executed them in the middle of the street , and left them there			0
people just watched it and did n't do anything			0
" a fleeting figure regarding fears of civilian casualties , he describes an occasion in 2007 when he saw a figure running toward a building in @entity21 seconds before the impact of a missile he had aimed at it			2
the small shape looked to him like that of a child			0
he says he and a colleague asked an intelligence observer on the mission about it			0
the response ? " per the review , it 's a dog			0
" @entity5 says he was sure it was n't a dog			0
in the end , he says , the report of the strike mentioned neither a dog nor a child			0
his life after leaving the program was plagued by drinking and depression			2
like many other drone operators , he was diagnosed with @entity235			2
he said he decided to speak out about his experience -- a decision that has earned him a great deal of vitriol from some of his former colleagues -- to show that drone crews ' involvement in war is " more than just a video game			2
