-- the major concern of the @entity2 in the current @entity6 - @entity5 conflict is a potential @entity6 ground incursion into @entity8 , @entity2 officials said friday			1
that would be a disastrous escalation that could trigger a larger conflict , a senior @entity2 official told @entity0			1

the official emphasized this is a @entity2 worry and the strong hope is @entity5 will stop its rocket attacks on @entity6 , thereby ending @entity6 strikes			1
" the question also is how much @entity5 wants to risk , " the official said			0

the @entity174 is continuing to keep to the standard deployment of three warships in the eastern @entity177 that can shoot down ballistic missiles fired by @entity67 that would threaten @entity6			0
those ships are not equipped to deal with the short - range rockets being used by @entity5			0
