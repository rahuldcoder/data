-- diplomatic tension between @entity2 and @entity3 heightened thursday after @entity2 's @entity4 freed a fugitive wanted for multiple killings in @entity3 in the 1970s			1
the high court 's decision appeared to put an end to years of wrangling over the fate of @entity12 , who was condemned to life in prison in @entity3 for four murders he denies committing while a member of an extremist left - wing group			1
@entity3 's foreign ministry responded to the wednesday night ruling with a promise to take the issue to the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25			1
" i can not but comment that today 's ruling by @entity2 's highest judicial body , apart from offending the right to justice of the victims of @entity12 's crimes , appears to run contrary to the obligations stated in the international accords that bind our two countries , which , moreover , have age - old ties of friendship and shared blood , " @entity3 foreign minister @entity26 said			1
the @entity2 judges found , by a vote of 6 - 3 , that former president @entity43 's decision to deny @entity12 's extradition was " an act of national sovereignty " that the high court could not reverse			1
@entity12 was a member of the @entity48 , or @entity48 , guerrilla group in @entity3			1
he is alleged to have participated in a number of crimes , which led to his incarceration			0
he escaped from an @entity3 prison in 1981 and was granted asylum in @entity55 during the presidency of @entity57			2
the so - called @entity58 gave asylum to all @entity3 militants who renounced the armed struggle			2
in 1998 , @entity12 was tried and convicted in absentia of the four killings			0
for several years , @entity55 and @entity3 were embroiled in diplomatic spats over extradition requests			2
@entity12 later fled to @entity66 , where he continued his work as a writer of thriller novels , and subsequently to @entity2			1
in @entity2 , his fate was oftentimes unclear			0
in january 2009 , the @entity2 @entity4 granted refugee status to @entity12			1
but later it reversed course and supported extradition , giving then - president @entity43 the final say			0
" @entity3 may not like it , but will have to respect it , " @entity43 said at the time			0
" this person is being accused of a crime which took place in 1978 , and his accuser no longer exists to prove the veracity of the facts			0
" @entity43 sided with the @entity3 's claims that the conviction against him was politically motivated , and in the last days of his administration rejected the extradition			2
" what is at stake here is an act of sovereignty of the president , " judge @entity86 said			0
" the @entity3 government has litigated against the @entity94 of @entity2			1
" the point the majority made was that they were not ruling on the @entity12 's culpability in the crimes , but whether the court had the power to overrule @entity43			2
another judge , @entity102 , said that when he studied the original request for extradition , he was convinced that @entity12 had indeed committed the crimes			2
" but right now , this is not the issue at stake , " he said			0
" i understand that the president made a political act , an act of government , which is characterized by broader discretion			0
" @entity3 prime minister @entity117 " learned with deep regret " about the court 's decision , his office said			1
" the decision does take into account the legitimate expectations of the justice of the @entity3 people and especially of the family of @entity12 's victims , " his office said in a statement			1
@entity48 was one of @entity3 's home - grown left - wing armed groups of the 1970s			0
like the infamous @entity130 , they committed politically motivated murders on behalf of what they saw as working - class ideals			0
@entity0 's @entity135 contributed to this report .			0

@entity12 faced life in prison in @entity3 for four alleged murders
the @entity2 court upheld a decision to reject extradition
@entity3 will turn to the @entity23
