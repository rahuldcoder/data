-- dear 17 - year - old self considering staying home on prom night because you do n't have a date , oh , you poor , stressed - out , self - hating misfit girl , just suck it up and go			1
it wo n't be the night of your life , as all those ' 80s movies and special tv episodes would lead you to believe			2
the boy you 've had a crush on since junior high wo n't suddenly declare his hidden love for you as he twirls you across the dance floor ( as it turns out , he 'd rather ask someone in a tux to dance )			0
there wo n't have been a secret addendum to the ballot electing you prom queen			1
no one is packing pig 's blood			1
your " virtue " will remain thoroughly intact			0
you 'll eat a perfectly adequate chicken cordon bleu in the company of your coupled - up and cuter friends ( one of whose " virtue " will undergo a status change after a six - pack of peach wine coolers )			0
you 'll dance badly and happily to " @entity36 " while listening to your girlfriends whine about how their dates are ignoring them in favor of the lively card tournament at the corner table			0
you 'll drink terrible schnapps in someone 's cousin 's hot tub afterward and comfort your tipsy pals as teenage romantic drama unfolds around you			2
you 'll also learn something pretty fundamental about yourself that night : you do n't need anyone 's permission to experience life or like yourself			2
i wish you could see what i see , some 23 years later -- that what seems right now like a shameful , public declaration of your unlovability is actually one of the things you 'll use as a source of strength time and time again			0
when you move to a sharp - edged city where you barely know a soul , board a plane for a solo trip to an unfamiliar country , or walk alone into a glittering party full of bold - faced and beautiful people , you 'll sometimes think about that early vote of confidence you took in yourself , square your shoulders and stride in like you belong			1
the damaging messages of proms i know you have n't been made to feel that way -- that the boy who you 'd gone to the previous dance with quite publicly said no this time			0
that you have n't been kissed since eighth grade			0
that your parents were not thrilled by the notion of shelling out cash for a dress when your date was technically a school - owned @entity84 camera			1
you 've gone through the indignity of knowing that the faculty advisers had to convene a special meeting to discuss your case and allow you to purchase a single ticket , as they had only ever been sold in pairs			2
yes , they decided you could technically attend in your capacity as yearbook photographer ( the pictures will be a huge hit on @entity96 -- it 's a future thing -- the year you all turn 40 ) but not all teachers had been in favor of that decision -- and made sure you knew they felt that way			1
and do you really want to embarrass yourself this way ? buy your own corsage , fix your terribly permed , purple - tinted hair , take a deep breath , walk in and make some memories , kid , before it all flickers away			0
high school prom , 50 years later just a few short months from now , everything , all of it , will change -- for the better			1
the college you chose contains your people -- warm , bold , weirdos bursting with life and art and big dreams , and they 'll like you an awful lot			0
if they 'd gone to the prom at all , it was in a tattered dress and combat boots or a duct - tape tailcoat ( the man you 'll marry attended his with green hair and played in the band ) and they 'll heartily encourage you to take your fussy little prom frock and turn it into a sculpture			1
the lack of kissing ( and that pesky virtue ) will be tended to in fairly short order in the company of a ridiculously beautiful boy who loves you for all your awkward angles and the fact that you do n't wait to be asked to dance			2
and when you look back at all the pictures snapped with that yearbook camera , you 'll be awfully glad you handed it off to a few friends as their prom dates spun you around on the dance floor			1
you 're in a few of those pictures			0
you look dorky , you look delighted , you look so very alive			0
follow @entity148 on @entity149 and @entity150 on @entity96 did you go to the prom alone , with a date or with friends ? if you had it to do all over again , who would you go with -- or would you just skip it ? please share in the comments below .			1

back in the *1990s* , @entity0 's @entity148 was an awkward teen with no date to the prom
@entity148 thought about not attending but decided to take a chance and go anyway
school faculty tried to *discourage* her but she forged ahead and attended solo
the decision was a boost to her confidence and helped her *navigate* other *social* *situations*
