-- the dozens of weapons a newspaper says the family of @entity6 owns are only for " sport and hunting , " the family says			1
the family , in a statement released tuesday , sought to distance itself from @entity12 , @entity6 's father , who said that some of the guns are for protection from crime -- protection he said the @entity19 government is not providing			1
the family 's statement also was at odds with one by @entity6 , who told the magistrate who granted him bond that he kept the handgun that killed his girlfriend at his bed because he 's " been a victim of violence and of burglaries			1
" opinion : why brutality is ingrained in psyche of @entity35 the " @entity36 own weapons purely for sport and hunting purposes , " the @entity38 icon 's family said in the statement provided by a spokesman			2
@entity44 , an @entity45 language newspaper , has reported the @entity6 family owns 55 weapons -- between his father , grandfather and two uncles -- not counting @entity6 's six guns			1
the family 's statement came in response to a controversy triggered when @entity12 defended the arsenal by telling a @entity57 newspaper that white @entity35 need guns for self - defense because the @entity19 , which gained control in 1994 with the collapse of @entity35 's apartheid system , does a poor job of protecting them			1
" some of the guns are for hunting and some are for protection , the hand guns , " @entity12 is quoted as telling a @entity66 reporter			2
" it speaks to the @entity19 government -- look at white crime levels , why protection is so poor in this country , it 's an aspect of our society			1
" while he said he 's never used any of his four firearms -- two rifles and two handguns -- for self - defense , " that does n't mean i have n't been hijacked , attacked			0
" " as a family , we value life much too much to produce guns at every opportunity we can use them , " @entity12 told the @entity66			2
" i have been in positions where i can use a gun but we have been brought up in a way that we value the lives of others very highly			0
" the @entity19 immediately attacked @entity12 , saying his statement was not only " devoid of truth , it is also racist			1
" " it is sad that he has chosen to politicize a tragic incident that is still fresh in the minds of those affected and the public , " @entity19 spokesman @entity96 said			2
" this tragic incident has affected two families that are still trying to come to terms with what happened and this latest racist slur is not assisting these families			0
we think it is ill - advisable for anyone to start apportioning undue blame			0
" @entity6 is charged with premeditated murder in the death of his girlfriend , model @entity112			0
prosecutors say the @entity114 killed @entity112 , 29 , after a heated argument in the early morning hours of @entity116			0
the double - amputee sprinter , known as the " @entity6 , " submitted a sworn affidavit to the judge considering his bail request last month saying he kept a 9 mm pistol " underneath my bed when i went to bed at night " because he was " acutely aware of violent crime being committed by intruders entering homes with a view to commit crime , including violent crime			1
" " i have received death threats before , " the affidavit said			0
" i have also been a victim of violence and of burglaries before			0
" the magistrate granted bail , allowing @entity6 to go free eight days after the shooting			0
the @entity6 family , which hired a " reputation management " firm to help with media relations , issued a statement monday saying , " @entity6 and the rest of the @entity6 family distances itself " from @entity12 ' comments			1
" @entity12 's interview with the newspaper was unapproved by our media liaison team , " family spokesman @entity146 , @entity12 's brother , said			2
" the comment does n't represent the views of @entity6 or the rest of the @entity6 family			1
" another political party -- the @entity154 of @entity35 -- weighed in on what it called " reckless remarks			0
" " it is actually believed by most @entity35 that the wealthy , mostly white people receive preferential treatment and it is for this reason that the @entity154 can not take seriously the claims made by @entity12 , " the party said			2
