-- concerns about alcohol abuse have been making headlines this week			1
a woman who drinks two glasses of wine every day is at risk for developing liver trouble , a doctor says			2
first , the @entity11 state of @entity12 reportedly announced it would shut down 800 alcohol shops			2
then , in @entity15 , chief medical officer @entity14 recommended thursday that anyone 15 years old and younger avoid alcohol completely			2
it 's no wonder people are worried			0
a recent survey of alcoholism studies in the @entity22 suggests that men have more than a 20 percent lifetime risk of developing alcohol - use disorders , while women 's risk is 8 to 10 percent			1
much of that risk is inherited			2
studies show that as much as 60 percent of the risk of alcohol - use disorders is genetic , said dr. @entity32 , professor of psychiatry at the @entity34 , and director of the alcohol and drug treatment program at the @entity39 - @entity38 , who wrote the @entity22 article			1
the risk for alcoholism is four times greater for children of alcoholics , even those who are adopted by non-alcoholic families , @entity32 said			1
but people who have a genetically influenced disorder can control it by behaving responsibly			0
just as someone at risk for diabetes should n't exacerbate the problem by becoming overweight , someone with a family history of alcoholism must avoid drinking too much			1
" if you know you 're at risk , it 's your responsibility to avoid the problems , " @entity32 said			2
why is the risk so much greater in men than women ? psychiatrists point out that young women also have twice the rate of depression and anxiety that men do , and daughters of alcoholic fathers tend more toward depression than alcoholism , said dr. @entity73 , psychiatrist and director of the @entity75 at @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78			1
" there may be a similar underlying neurobiology to a lot of psychiatric conditions , and how they manifest in particular has something to do with circumstances , has something to do with gender , and has something to do with age , " @entity73 said			0
there are also cultural factors in this gender pattern , but less is known about them , he said			0
he said women tend toward alcoholism in their 40s and 50s -- which may be their way of counteracting anxiety -- around the time that men tend to develop depression			1
another genetic trait is involved in sensitivity to alcohol			2
@entity107 , @entity108 , and @entity109 people tend to have a mutation in their alcohol - metabolizing genes that makes them more sensitive -- meaning they tend to drink less than people from other backgrounds , he said			1
data show that the earlier you start drinking away from your family , the greater the risk of alcohol problems later in life , he said			1
on average , people begin drinking apart from the family at 15 , a number that has n't changed much in decades , @entity32 said			0
how much is too much ? male livers can metabolize about twice as much alcohol as females ' , meaning men can drink about twice as much as women before it becomes dangerous , @entity73 said			1
" a woman who drinks two glasses of wine every day of her life is actually at risk for developing liver trouble , " @entity73 said			2
recommended drinking habits vary from person to person			0
to reap the health benefits from wine , a glass to a glass - and - a - half a day is recommended for women , and twice that amount for men , he said			1
getting help treating alcoholism is similar to helping people with other chronic conditions -- for example , getting a diabetic person to be compliant with medications , @entity32 said			1
with both alcoholism and diabetes , therapy involves working with a person to alter behavior and help watch for signs of relapse			2
" the core of treatment for any long term chronic disorder that requires changes in how you do things in life is to help people to recognize that they have a problem , and they can do something about it , " @entity32 said			0
a combination of medication and cognitive - behavioral therapy is usually the best treatment option for alcoholism , @entity32 said			1
cognitive - behavioral therapy involves changing a person 's mindset -- recognizing the problem -- and improving behavior			0
three medications are available in the @entity182 to treat alcoholism , @entity32 said			1
a drug called acamprosate targets the nervous system and helps people decrease their craving by allowing them to sleep better and feel less anxious			0
@entity189 , on the other hand , blocks opioid receptors and dampens the good feelings that would normally come along with drinking			0
these two in combination work slightly better than either alone , he said			0
a third option is disulfiram , which actually paralyzes the ability of one of the alcohol metabolizing enzymes to work , he said			0
that makes it especially nauseating and , in rare cases , deadly , for a person taking the drug to drink alcohol			0
support groups such as @entity208 that offer 12 - step programs are great resources , and they 're free , @entity32 said			0
while imperfect , 12 - step programs are often the best option , @entity73 said .			0
