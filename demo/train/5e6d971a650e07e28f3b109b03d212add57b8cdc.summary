-- the @entity1 on monday recalled its envoy to @entity3 in the wake of a blistering report accusing church leaders of covering up extensive abuse of young people by priests			1
archbishop @entity11 was recalled to @entity12 " for consultations with the ( @entity1 ) @entity14 , " the official @entity10 said in citing a statement from the @entity17 's leadership			1
the move came in reaction to this month 's release of the @entity22 report about " allegations of abuse of minors by clergy ... and , in particular , in the wake of subsequent reactions			1
" released july 13 , the 421 - page report into abuses in the diocese of @entity22 -- near the southern city of @entity33 -- demolished claims by the @entity17 in @entity3 that policies it put in place in 1996 had enabled it to get a handle on the problem			1
it details how complaints against 19 clerics in the diocese were dealt with between 1996 and 2009			0
it also accused bishop @entity46 , who was responsible for policing abuse in his diocese , of not backing the policy himself and failing to take action against abusers			0
the @entity1 last week had promised action , with the rev. @entity52 , director of the @entity1 press office , saying in a statement the church " will respond appropriately			1
" he added the @entity1 's aim is to promote the protection of children and restore " an atmosphere of trust and collaboration in the @entity17 and in society			2
" his comments came days after @entity3 prime minister @entity64 launched a stinging attack			0
he claimed that the @entity22 report exposed the @entity1 as seeking to frustrate an inquiry into child sex abuse for its own benefit , even after the scandal blew up worldwide			1
on listening to the evidence of humiliation and betrayal , @entity64 said , " the @entity1 's reaction was to parse and analyze it with the gimlet eye of a canon lawyer ... this calculated , withering position being the polar opposite of the radicalism , humility and compassion upon which the @entity17 was founded			0
" the report exposed " a tale of a frankly brazen disregard for protecting children , " the prime minister added , as he praised the courage of the victims of abuse who had spoken out to investigators			0
@entity52 responded in a statement saying some criticisms of the @entity1 went too far and " demonstrate little awareness of what the @entity1 has actually done over the years to help effectively address the problem			2
" one point of contention is a 1997 letter from the @entity1 's envoy to @entity3 that warns bishops to follow church law while investigating cases of suspected child sex abuse by priests			1
the envoy expresses " serious reservations " about requiring that such cases be reported to the police			0
that letter , since being revealed recently , has stoked harsh criticism in @entity3			0
numerous @entity3 victims of sexual abuse , for example , wrote collectively in january that they are " disgusted " by the message			2
the @entity1 , in turn , has called the letter " deeply misunderstood			0
