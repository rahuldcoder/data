@entity0 -- one of four @entity0 women struck down with septic shock after receiving a " beauty " treatment normally given to cancer patients has died			1
the 46 - year - old died wednesday morning at a local hospital one week after receiving @entity11 therapy through the @entity13 beauty center , local authorities said			1
according to the @entity0 @entity15 , the @entity11 procedure involves the " concentration and processing of blood taken from the person , and subsequent infusion of the mixture back into the patient			1
" it 's not clear whether any of the women who received the treatment had been diagnosed with cancer , though the @entity0 @entity15 said in an earlier statement that the 46 - year - old had been in " good past health			1
" the woman , who has only been identified by authorities by her surname " @entity32 , " was admitted to hospital last thursday suffering fever and diarrhea , hours after receiving the treatment			1
she was diagnosed with septic shock , and on sunday authorities announced her blood samples had grown the bacterium @entity40			1
dr. @entity42 , president of the @entity44 's @entity43 told @entity1 that , under normal circumstances , @entity45 did not pose a threat to healthy people			0
" it 's common , it 's widespread			0
it can be found in dust and soil and water			0
people often come into contact with a small number of this bacteria and it 's of no harm at all unless you have a wound , " dr. @entity42 said			0
however , he said it appeared as though the bacteria had entered the woman 's blood			2
" for blood infection involving internal organs , it 's very difficult			0
it has to involve multiple drugs given at the same time and there are uncertainties about the effectiveness of the treatment , " he told @entity1 on monday			2
three other women remain in hospital after having the treatment , health authorities said wednesday			1
a 60 - year - old is in critical condition , a 56 - year - old woman is in serious condition , while another , 59 , is stable			2
dr. @entity42 said the use of the @entity11 treatment for cosmetic purposes was not something he 'd ever heard of before			1
" i have serious doubts about the medical and scientific basis of the treatment , " he said			0
professor @entity93 , chair of @entity94 at the @entity44 's @entity95 , said the procedure was " only indicated for patients with metastatic cancer and often as salvage therapy when there are no other feasible options			2
" the @entity0 @entity15 and police are investigating the matter but , as of wednesday morning , police said no arrests had been made			1
health authorities have instructed the @entity13 beauty clinic to halt the procedure			1
over the weekend , the founder of @entity13 , dr. @entity109 - wing , told local media that his staff referred clients to an independent doctor who administered the therapy			2
he denied suggestions that it was offered as a medical treatment			2
the clinic has yet to respond to @entity1 requests for reaction to wednesday 's death			0
" i did n't say that it can cure any diseases			0
remember that we are a beauty clinic			1
we refer clients to doctor ( s ) , and we have had the clients to sign a liability - free form , which states that it is not for medical use , " he said			0
a statement on the beauty clinic 's website says that the treatment " was conducted by an independent doctor at a medical clinic , and the doctor is not hired by our beauty store			1
" the statement also said it was up to the independent doctor to decide whether the client is suitable for treatment before he or she receives it			0
it added : " we will assist related government departments to find out the causation of this particular incident			0
" according to its website , the @entity13 group of clinics was established in 1995 and provides services for more than 1,000 clients each day			0
