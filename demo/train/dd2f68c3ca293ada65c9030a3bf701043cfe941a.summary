-- the ugly subject of sledging in cricket raised its head again on thursday as @entity4 remained on course for a 4 - 0 series whitewash against the touring @entity8 side			1
@entity9 scored his maiden test century , but the young @entity8 batsman complained bitterly about the comments he received after almost running himself out on 99			1
the 23 - year - old blamed @entity13 after his ordeal at the end of the 90th over , bowled by five - wicket hero @entity16 , which came on @entity4 's national holiday			1
@entity4 captain @entity19 joins illustrious club " @entity13 said something to me which was totally unnecessary ... out of the blue , " @entity9 told reporters			1
" he was n't even bowling or doing anything			0
i survived that run out and he just said something which i ca n't obviously say in a press conference			0
i gave it back to him , saying , ' you did n't even have anything to do with it , why would you do that ? ' " at the time @entity9 , playing in his eighth test match , was making a defiant stand of 33 runs for the ninth wicket with tailender @entity36 in hot conditions in @entity38			1
" they sledge when they get frustrated			0
obviously it was hot out there , " he said			0
" constantly they were sledging the players so they could spoil our concentration			2
during that partnership they were really , really loud			0
" @entity9 also complained about abuse from the crowd -- a single - day record 35,081 for @entity4 - @entity8 matches at the venue -- when he was fielding later			1
@entity4 reached stumps on 50 - 3 in their second innings , an overall lead of 382 runs after @entity8 's first - innings 272			1
" it is really , really frustrating at times because they say stuff which should n't be said on a cricket field , " @entity9 said			2
" we go out there to play , not to get abused like that			0
if they 've come here to enjoy the game of cricket they should do that , not get drunk and abuse players			0
" if the players say anything they 're fined and banned , but the crowd can just say anything and go home			2
" tensions between the side were stoked before the match started when @entity8 batsman @entity79 criticised @entity16 , saying the bowler could only perform his own wickets			1
however , his words came back to haunt him as @entity16 dismissed the opener for 34 with a rising delivery as he claimed figures of 5 - 49 and a total of 22 wickets so far in the series			0
" @entity79 thought i had the luck of the green wickets but i guess there was n't much bounce in this wicket today and it seemed to get him out , so it was a nice little reward for a wicket that is hard to bowl on , " @entity16 said			0
he also claimed the scalp of cricket 's highest run scorer @entity98 , who fell for 25 as his bid to become the first player to score 100 international centuries continues			0
@entity13 contributed 3 - 62 , while @entity9 top - scored with 116 as he added 114 for the sixth wicket with @entity104 , who made 34 standing in for suspended captain and wicketkeeper @entity106			1
@entity107 then took two wickets and veteran fast bowler @entity109 another as the @entity111 top order collapsed			0
captain @entity19 and his predecessor @entity113 , who both made double centuries in @entity4 's first innings of 604 - 7 declared , were unbeaten on nine and one respectively at the end of the third day			1
meanwhile , @entity117 took four late wickets to restrict @entity120 's hopes of a big first - innings lead in the second test in @entity123 on thursday			1
top - ranked @entity120 , having dismissed the " home " side for 257 , ended the second day on 207 - 5 as off - spinner @entity126 continued his fine form			1
@entity126 , who took 7 - 55 as @entity117 won the first test in @entity129 by 10 wickets , dismissed opener @entity131 ( 94 ) , @entity133 ( 14 ) and @entity134 ( three ) in the last 30 minutes			2
@entity135 started the collapse when he bowled @entity137 for 74 , ending a stand of 139 with @entity131			0
@entity117 had resumed on 256 - 7 , but seamer @entity139 dismissed captain @entity140 ( 84 ) to finish with four wickets , and @entity142 took two in four balls in the next over			2
the three - match series is being played in the @entity147 as @entity117 can not host internationals due to past security problems .			2
