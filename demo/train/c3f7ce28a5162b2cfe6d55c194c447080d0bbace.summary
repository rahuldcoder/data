-- @entity2 executive chairman @entity1 is confident that the auto industry is on its way to eliminating co2 emissions			2
he 's less confident , however , that the world is prepared to adequately deal with an even larger problem : the global gridlock created by a population set to grow to 9 billion people by 2044			1
the growth , said @entity2 in a talk at the @entity14 conference in @entity15 , @entity16 on wednesday , will see the number of vehicles on the road go from 800 million today to 2 - 3 billion by 2050			0
the global gridlock crisis , as @entity2 describes it , will " stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and healthcare ... [ and ] our quality of life will be significantly compromised			2

@entity2 envisions a future where all cars are connected and as he puts it , " talk to each other , " such that you already have a parking spot at your destination when you leave your house , be automatically re-routed to avoid traffic based on data being sent in real - time by the cars in front of you , and find a cab via your smartphone			1
in theory , this data would also let you live a more efficient life , enabling you to leave your home such that you 'll get to your destination precisely on time			0
@entity1 thinks such a future " will be ready for prime time really soon , " noting that tests of such systems are already under way around the world			0
of course , @entity2 's company has been an early mover in the connected car space , with @entity74 technology now on board 3 million vehicles			0
ultimately though , he sees solving the global gridlock crisis as a huge opportunity for entrepreneurs of all sizes , that can both be profitable and as he puts it , " preserve the freedom to move effortlessly around the world " that has been responsible for so much economic growth in the century since his great grandfather created the @entity2			1
