-- @entity2 's birthday celebrations were brought to an abrupt halt after his plans to compete at the @entity5 were thrown into jeopardy on wednesday			1
a long - term back injury looks set to sideline the world no. 2 , who was forced to retire from his second - round match at the @entity11 on the day he turned 26			1
and with the @entity14 showpiece event set to begin on may 26 , @entity2 faces a race against time to prove his fitness			1
" i 'd be very surprised if i was playing in @entity14 , " the @entity18 star , who lost in the quarterfinals in @entity20 last week , told reporters following his match against @entity24 's @entity23			1
" i felt pain today , the same as in @entity20			2
i took a few days off after @entity20			2
i hit yesterday and played some points			2
but i was still sore today			2
" the pain in the lower left of his back has caused @entity2 discomfort since late 2011 and is the same injury which required a painkilling injection at last year 's @entity5			1
" we will have to wait and see on @entity14 , " he said			2
" i 'll try to make a decision after the next five days or so			0
i need some days off for it to hopefully settle down			0
" @entity2 's retirement came as something of a surprise after he had fought back from losing the opening set 6 - 3 and being down 4 - 1 in the second to level the match following a tiebreak			1
but after undergoing on - court treatment with the trainer early in the second set , @entity2 decided to call time on his @entity11 challenge			1
it is the first time since 2007 that @entity2 has retired during a contest -- that was at the @entity53 where he suffered a wrist injury which ruled him out of the @entity5 and @entity55			1
@entity2 , who has never won a clay - court title despite training on the surface as a young teen in @entity24 , reached the quarterfinals at @entity5 last year			1
but the @entity60 and @entity62 champion now looks unlikely to challenge for the title in the @entity65 capital			0
" ( the back ) has not been perfect for a long period , i want it to start feeling good again , " the @entity66 said			1
" everyone goes into matches with niggles , but this is very frustrating			0
" some shots hurt more on clay because the movement is so exaggerated			0
there is not a lot of power on the ball so you have to generate power and pace yourself			0
" i do n't want to go into details , but i 've got a disc problem , it changes week to week			0
it 's been an issue for a while , but i want to make sure it goes away			0
" i do n't want to be playing with it long term , it 's not enjoyable at all			0
" elsewhere , @entity65 eighth seed @entity92 suffered a shock defeat by @entity95 , going down 6 - 4 7 - 6			0
the 24th - ranked @entity96 ripped his shirt off in delight after his best result this year , earning a clash with @entity65 ninth seed @entity101			0
in the women 's section , defending champion @entity103 eased to a 6 - 2 6 - 2 win over @entity24 's @entity107			0
former @entity5 winner @entity108 overcame @entity110 compatriot @entity109 6 - 3 6 - 1 as she bounced back from her first - round defeat in @entity20 , while there were also victories for @entity114 , @entity115 and home favorite @entity116 .			1
