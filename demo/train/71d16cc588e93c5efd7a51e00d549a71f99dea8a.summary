-- disbelieving @entity2 fans have been celebrating with their @entity4 - winning team in @entity5 on a victory parade the day after the club won the trophy for the first time in their history			1
@entity2 's squad and temporary manager @entity11 traveled on two open - top buses , waving blue scarves as they showed off the famous trophy with the " big ears			1
" cheering fans crowded onto the streets and even climbed up trees and lampposts and onto bus stops around southwest @entity5 to catch a glimpse of their heroes , including matchwinner @entity24			1
@entity2 , who overcame @entity27 in the semifinals , were 1 - 0 down against @entity29 with seven minutes remaining at the @entity30 , but @entity24 conjured an 88th - minute equalizer			1
the @entity33 striker then scored the winning penalty in the shoot - out with what could be his final kick for @entity2			2
the 34 - year - old 's contract runs out this summer , and he has been linked with a move to @entity40			0
it capped a remarkable few months for @entity2 , who sacked @entity44 manager @entity43 in late march with the team toiling in the @entity46 and trailing 3 - 1 against @entity47 after the first leg of their @entity4 last 16 match			1
under @entity50 , @entity2 somehow overturned the deficit against @entity47 , but a miraculous victory over @entity27 managed to overshadow that			2
@entity2 looked doomed again after skipper @entity54 was sent off early in the second leg and they went 2 - 1 down on aggregate , but once again the @entity57 triumphed against the odds -- and repeated the trick against @entity29 in the @entity62 's club 's home stadium			1
the win also guaranteed @entity2 a place in the @entity4 next season after missing out via the @entity46 by only finishing sixth			1
@entity66 , who finished fourth in the @entity69 league , will have to settle for the @entity70			0
as the buses came to a halt on sunday , @entity54 , who was suspended for the final but lifted the trophy with @entity76 , led the players and fans in a chant of " champions , champions , ole ole ole			1
" when the microphone was passed to @entity24 , he was serenaded by both players and fans with " @entity24 , we want you to stay			2
" @entity89 , the club 's wealthy @entity90 owner , was also on the parade to witness the celebrations of @entity24 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , and countless other signings made under his big - spending ownership			0
winning the @entity4 had been @entity89 's dream and plenty of managers were fired over their failure to deliver it , but @entity50 's future is still far from secure			2
" whatever the club decides i will respect , it 's as simple as that , " the @entity106 coach said after the match in @entity108			0
as the @entity2 fans celebrated , the mood in @entity108 was predictably somber			1
once the delirious opposition fans had departed -- an estimated 100,000 @entity2 supporters were in @entity108 -- the city was left to mourn what most of the @entity62 newspapers saw as a desperately unlucky defeat			2
sports daily @entity123 's headline read : " @entity124 , we are crying with you ! " @entity124 , the talisman of the @entity29 team who came through the youth system at the club , hit the post with a hesitant penalty in the shoot out			2
former @entity2 winger @entity132 had missed a chance to wrap it up even before the shoot out when he had a penalty saved by @entity96 in extra time			0
@entity2 had one corner in the entire match and scored from it through @entity24			0
@entity29 had 20 corners , and 43 attempts on goal to @entity2 's nine			1
" it 's like a nightmare , " @entity29 director of sport @entity143 said			0
" when you see how the game played itself out , it 's like a bad film			0
" this is frustrating and depressing to digest			0
this defeat is very difficult to take			0
" @entity29 daily @entity153 concluded : " how much bad luck fits into a single football match ? "			0

@entity2 parade the @entity4 trophy through southwest @entity5
the @entity57 beat @entity29 on penalties for their first ever @entity4 win
@entity2 captain @entity54 leads players and fans in chant of " champions "
