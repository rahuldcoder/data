-- @entity1 insists he is not thinking about the prospect of his @entity4 rivals @entity5 and @entity6 combining to deprive him of a third @entity8 title this weekend			1
the season comes to a climax at sunday 's @entity11 with four drivers battling to take home motorsport 's biggest prize			1
@entity15 's @entity1 holds an eight - point lead over second - placed @entity5 , with @entity6 in third 15 points off the top			1
@entity20 driver @entity19 has an outside chance of claiming his second crown , being 24 points behind @entity1 with only 25 on offer to the winner			1
with @entity4 having already secured the constructors ' championship , this has led to speculation that the 23 - year - old @entity6 will be asked to allow his @entity31 teammate to overtake him if the pair are leading the field at the @entity34			1
latest f1 championship standings but two - time champion @entity1 -- whose team was fined $ 100,000 in september for telling @entity37 to allow the @entity38 to win july 's @entity39 @entity11 -- says he is focusing on his own race , needing a first or second - place finish to ensure another title			1
" i do n't think i would lose even one second of my energy this weekend thinking of what is going to happen on sunday afternoon , " the 29 - year - old told @entity45 's official website when asked whether he would understand if @entity6 assisted @entity5			1
" our only picture of the race at the moment is winning it or finishing second			0
that 's the target and i think that 's what we 're going to achieve this weekend			0
" i think there 's not anything we can do other than try to finish second or first in the race , that is mathematically our position to win the championship , so it 's our goal , from friday to sunday , our preparation will be to reach that target			2
" @entity6 would not be drawn on whether he is planning to support his colleague during sunday 's race , but he did admit he was keen to avoid a repeat of this year 's @entity69 where he and @entity5 crashed while battling for position			1
" if the situation occurs then i think we know that we 're driving for the team , " the @entity39 said			0
" we have had some occasions this year where we got close and it did n't look too good , so i think the main target is not to repeat that , and the rest we will see			0
" there are lots of things happening , and more important things happening before we enter this possible stage , whatever the scenario			0
" meanwhile , @entity5 claimed he would take a lot of positive memories from the 2010 season , even if he does miss out on the world championship			1
" i know that i 've been very fortunate even to have a chance to get to this point , " the 34 - year - old said			2
" it 's been a very long season for all of us , and as the season 's gone on we 've achieved so many amazing things , and obviously , personally , for me , to have some very special weekends			2
" @entity19 must come home first and hope @entity1 is outside the top - 10 to stand any chance of repeating his 2008 success			2
" i have nothing to lose , " the 25 - year - old @entity102 driver said			0
" the guys in front of me have everything to lose , so for me i am going to be flat - out as always			0
" they have got generally faster cars than me but that does n't mean that we can not fight for a win			0
obviously i have to win this race			0
that 's what we plan to do			0

@entity1 is not *concerned* about possible @entity4 team orders in sunday 's season finale
@entity4 drivers @entity5 and @entity6 can still win the world championship
@entity6 would not comment on whether he would help second - placed @entity5 in @entity121
@entity19 is also still in with an outside chance of taking the world crown
