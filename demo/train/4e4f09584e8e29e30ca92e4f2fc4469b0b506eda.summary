@entity50 where : @entity52 , @entity53 when news broke that the cutting - edge @entity57 ( aka the @entity57 ) would be converted into a theme park , expectations were high			1
and sure enough , @entity60 's first themed indoor water attraction debuted in 2011 tricked out with valves , cranks , jellyfish , buckets , water cannons , giant bubbles , climb nets and spray tubes -- and that 's the short list of design elements			2
crazy fact : @entity50 is made up of 12 slides ( the most of any water - play structure in the world ) and boasts its own giant water - filled cube that periodically soaks those waiting for their turn			1
toboggan where : @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 @entity85 slides form @entity87 's most scenic water attraction , which runs down a cliff on the northwest coast of the island			1

but adrenaline junkies will want to head outdoors for the newest challenge : the 66 - foot - tall @entity142 , which debuted in june			1
while the ride lasts only seven seconds , do n't underestimate the rush you can get from its sharp vertical plunge and a gravity - powered loop - the - loop , which riders experience at a 2.5 g - force			2

crazy fact : a @entity183 search of bowl slides turns up videos of unsuspecting riders getting stuck in the " drain			0
" not on this slide			0

@entity40 where : @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity41 @entity41 's 135 - foot attraction stands out from the crowd , even if it 's not quite the tallest waterslide to make our list ( @entity84 's 197 - foot @entity204 takes that title )			1
riders are certainly impressed and wait in line to brave that infamous 14 - story drop			0

after climbing up the 90 - foot tower , riders have their pick among five , including a 328 - foot - long chute with an added jump section at the bottom			1
crazy fact : the tower is also fitted with five diving boards ( at 6.5 , 16 , 33 , 66 and 91 feet high ) , though the tallest two are reserved for professional divers			0
@entity262 where : @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 this 60 - foot - tall , nearly perpendicular slide cascades down a life - size replica of a @entity270 temple -- the hallmark of the resort 's 140 - acre waterscape			1
but for many , the real " leap of faith " occurs after the initial drop when you 're subsequently propelled through a clear acrylic tunnel in a shark - infested lagoon			0
crazy fact : in 2008 , a female reef shark vaulted out of its tank and landed on the slide			0
while no resort guests were harmed ( the water park had yet to open for the morning ) , the shark could not tolerate the chlorinated water and died shortly afterward			0
cliffhanger where : @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 the park 's crowd - pleasing attraction , which debuted in 2007 , was part of a significant expansion -- and @entity299 still stands as the tallest and steepest ride among all four @entity290 parks in the @entity243 @entity302 , this single body slide consists of an alarming vertical drop			1
after being propelled from the top of the tower , riders plunge nearly 81 feet at speeds of up to 35 mph			0
crazy fact : the cliffhanger is designed as an open chute , so you 'll be fully aware and exposed every second of that free - fall drop			0
@entity314 where : @entity141 and @entity141 , @entity316 , @entity317 the $ 5.5 million @entity319 ride , a high - speed hydromagnetic water coaster that uses linear induction motor technology , put this water park on the map in 2011			1

( @entity319 takes second place			0
) crazy fact : six - person rafts are propelled up and down hills in 12 - foot - wide channels			1
there are five enclosed slide sections , which means you 'll be doing that twisting and shouting in the dark			0
@entity10 : @entity141 's coolest pools @entity29 where : @entity35 and @entity34 cruise ships meet " the duck " -- the cruise industry 's first - ever shipboard water coaster			2
the 765 - foot - long , four - deck - high @entity29 debuted on @entity35 in 2011 and has since been added to @entity34			1
atop the aft deck , passengers hop on a two - person inflatable raft that is then propelled forward by high - powered water jets			0
expect to be dropped , looped around and accelerated			0
crazy fact : after the initial drop , riders are thrust through a clear acrylic " swing out " flume that extends 12 feet over the side of the ship -- and 150 feet above the ocean 's surface			0
@entity357 's @entity302 where : @entity359 at @entity360 , @entity361 the first thing you see when you enter @entity359 is 90 - foot snowcapped @entity357 , the world 's most photographed faux - mountain and home to one of the fastest free - fall speed slides			1
from the @entity302 's ski jump tower , riders take a vertical plunge straight down to the base of the mountain			0
