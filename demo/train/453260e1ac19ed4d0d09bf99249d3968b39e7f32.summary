-- for as long as we 've watched television , we 've talked about it			0
and thanks to social media , in the past few years we 've moved our living room discussions and chit - chats around office water coolers to the wider digital world			1
viewers now take to @entity11 to exchange their views with friends , and shows frequently broadcast their suggested @entity15 hash - tag over opening credits			1
viewers of x factor can even tweet their vote for contestants , and in the @entity22 characters from @entity23 have their own @entity15 accounts on which they tweet , as the show is broadcast			1
for producers and broadcasters , who are increasingly aware of the benefits of an online buzz , encouraging this kind of real - time viewer interactionâ € ” or " social television " â € ” is increasingly important			2
and for social media companies , any tie - in with television can only be advantageous			1
a recent @entity38 survey showed that the @entity39 still spend 12 times more time watching @entity40 or @entity41 ( the @entity43 's largest television channels ) than they do looking at @entity15 , @entity11 and @entity44			1
they also consume television in significantly longer sessions			0
however the two sources are increasingly being consumed simultaneously			0
numerous studies have discovered that up to 80 % of television viewers of all ages now incorporate a " second screen " -- laptop , smartphone or tablet computer - into their viewing habits			1
apps , such as @entity57 , have recently hit the market , designed to facilitate this new merging of multiple sources			0
@entity57 determines what show is currently being viewed and then provides streams from relevant social media , as well as offering targeted links to spin - off products , and background information about the actors , music or writers drawn from online resources			1
according to the marketing campaign , the app allows its users to " sit together on a virtual couch ... even though you may not be in the same place together			0
" simultaneously , the broadcasters can hawk their wares and generate additional e-commerce revenue			0
social media company @entity80 has a similar app named @entity83 , and has also built a social media platform specifically for x factor			1
this includes a " tap and clap " facility , through which viewers can virtually boo or clap an act at the touch of a button , without even the need to construct a 140 - character response			1
in the app 's first five weeks in operation , there were more than 100 million claps or boos			0
while @entity101 , remains by far the biggest regular hitter when it comes to tv - related tweets in the @entity43 -- 3.7 million of the 38.7 million made about shows broadcast free - to - air on @entity39 television from april 1 to november 1 this year -- it is not just entertainment shows getting in on the act			2
according to research by @entity113 , the list of the top 20 tweeted shows also includes news and current affairs programs , as well as sports coverage including @entity119 and @entity120			2
by transforming broadcasts into multi-media events , not only do the programs attract more viewers , but also the necessity grows among the audience to watch the first screening , or else be exposed to spoilers and excluded from the fun			1
" if you 're not playing along at the time the show is being broadcast , you both do n't get to see what your friends are doing , and they do n't get to see what you 're doing , " said @entity130 , founder of @entity113			0
" you 're much , much more out of the loop			0
" this community spirit means that broadcasters can guarantee to advertisers that their shows attract a real - time audience and can not therefore skip the commercials			2
media analysts are coy on the specifics of what is lined up next for social television			2
@entity149 , of the social media agency we are @entity152 , hinted that there are innovations afoot surrounding the broadcasts of major sporting events			1
meanwhile @entity130 said that he is talking with producers of more than 20 shows across all the major @entity43 broadcasters preparing to enhance their interactive output			2
@entity130 said that he has encountered proposals for social media interaction with drama series , where an audience vote would determine plot twists and denouements , essentially turning television drama into a " @entity169 " - style experience			1
this approach has yielded indifferent results in more high - brow pursuits -- recent attempts in collaborative novel - writing have largely failed -- but the advertising world has already embraced similar interactivity			0
the " @entity180 " advertising campaign for telecoms company @entity179 , for example , invited viewers to decide the fate of their eponymous fictional couple			0
more than 1.6 million @entity11 voters decided to bestow a child on the lovers and then also had their say on the minutia of the couple 's wedding			0
" we 've moved on from a temporary aberration where , through the invention of the printing press all the way through to the invention of tv , communication became one - way for a few hundred years , " @entity149 said			0
" that 's not the natural human state			0
social media has brought us all back around the campfire and allowed us to talk to each other and to take part in the stories people are telling			1

social media and tv are becoming *closer* entwined
@entity211 allows tv audience to vote , boo or cheer contestants via @entity15
around 80 % of tv viewers watch shows with a " second screen "
