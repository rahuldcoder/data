-- this week , @entity1 , a retired four - star @entity2 general perhaps best known for having served as secretary of state under president @entity5 , endorsed @entity7 's bid for re-election during an interview with " @entity10			1
" given that @entity1 had enthusiastically endorsed @entity7 in 2008 , his decision to back him yet again should n't come as too much of a surprise			1
yet @entity1 's endorsement of a @entity15 candidate is seen as significant because he describes himself as " a @entity16 of a more moderate mold , " who laments that @entity16 moderates are " something of a dying breed			1
" @entity1 expressed discontent with the @entity16 stance on climate change , immigration and education , and he seemed more comfortable with @entity7 's approach to achieving fiscal balance than @entity29 's			1
@entity1 is also , among other things , a defender of racial preferences in college admissions and abortion rights			1
while it is certainly true that @entity1 's views were not uncommon among moderate and liberal @entity16 of an earlier era , it is not entirely clear why he chooses not to identify as a @entity38 or as a liberal - leaning independent			1
one assumes that @entity1 has some residual loyalty to the party of @entity41 and @entity42 , which is , of course , fair enough			1
but would @entity46 democracy be better and healthier if we had more republicans such as @entity1 and more democrats such as , say , former @entity46 sen. @entity49 , the @entity50 @entity38 who famously endorsed president @entity5 at the @entity51 ? @entity52 : both parties have a race problem some believe that blurring the boundaries of the two major political parties would be a very good thing as it would make legislative compromise more likely			1
historically , it is certainly true that avowedly centrist legislators , such as the @entity63 who worked closely with @entity16 presidents such as @entity66 and @entity67 , have played an important role in shaping policy			1
there is , however , a significant downside to this blurring of boundaries			0
political scientists @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 have argued that while we tend to focus on voter turnout as an important aspect of democratic citizenship , we should also pay attention to whether citizens are voting correctly			0
to vote correctly , in the view of @entity75 and company , is to vote in accordance with your fully informed preferences			2
and one of the surest ways to increase correct voting is to give voters races in which candidates are reasonably ideologically distinct			2
if , like @entity1 , you strongly believe that we need more regulation of carbon emissions , an approach to deficit reduction that involves substantial increases in federal taxes as well as spending cuts , an immigration policy that gives unauthorized immigrants the opportunity to become lawful permanent residents without first requiring that they return to their country of origin , and an education policy that emphasizes higher levels of public spending over competition among educational providers , it would n't just be unusual to back @entity29 over @entity7 -- it would actually be , in the sense articulated by @entity75 and his co-authors , incorrect			1
in light of the first - past - the - post nature of our electoral system , and the dominance of the two major political parties , candidates do tend to try to blur distinctions as general elections approach , thus raising the risk of incorrect voting			2
but as @entity63 and @entity16 have grown more ideologically coherent , as liberals have joined the @entity63 and as conservatives have joined the @entity16 , this risk has decreased considerably			2
one might still object to partisan polarization on the grounds that it makes compromise extremely difficult			0
oddly enough , the best solution to this problem might not be weaker political parties , in which individual officeholders are less likely to toe the party line and more likely to cross the aisle , but rather stronger political parties			2
in " @entity148 , @entity149 , " @entity141 and @entity142 argue that successive legislative efforts to reform campaign finance have left the @entity46 with a candidate - centered rather than a party - centered political system			0
specifically , restrictions on the extent to which candidates can coordinate fundraising and campaigning efforts with party organizations have essentially left candidates to fend for themselves			0
while this might sound more attractive than a system with powerful party bosses , a candidate - centered system leads to a situation in which candidates have to spend enormous amounts of time and effort raising money , particularly if they are challenging incumbents			0
this in turn makes candidates dependent on donors , whether they are wealthy individuals or special interest groups			0
one result of a candidate - centered system is that many people who would make excellent public servants are effectively shut out of the political process			0
in a party - centered system , in contrast , candidates rely on the party for financial and organizational support			0
this gives the central party organization considerable leverage over candidates , which they can use to enforce some measure of party discipline			0
parties would also be more resistant to capture by special interests than individual legislators , as they would be in a position to balance the needs of a much broader array of interests			0
so how would stronger parties improve the quality of governance ? whereas individual candidates are primarily interested in their own short - term survival , party organizations have a longer - term perspective			2
stronger party organizations would , for example , have a strong incentive to develop a coherent legislative program , as doing so would help build the party brand			0
if the @entity208 and @entity209 were controlled by the same party , this coherent legislative program could be implemented more easily under a party - centered system , in which legislators know what they 've been put into office to accomplish , than under a candidate - centered system , in which its every legislator for herself or himself			1
consider @entity7 's first two years , in which large numbers of congressional @entity63 from marginal seats kept frustrating the party 's agenda			1
these rebellious @entity63 feared that sticking with the @entity208 would cause them to lose their seats , but their efforts made @entity7 look weak , which in turn contributed to the @entity16 takeover of the @entity208			1
had these congressional @entity63 been subject to stronger party discipline , the party as a whole might have been much better off			0
a party - centered system also works better in a divided government , as opposition parties would n't be solely dedicated to frustrating the president 's agenda			2
rather , they 'd dedicate themselves to achieving their longer - term legislative objectives , which would often entail working with the other side			0
a stronger @entity16 organization might have exerted more pressure on newly elected congressional republicans to compromise on the debt limit , as the perception of @entity16 extremism may have damaged the party 's brand in potentially winnable suburban districts outside of the @entity251			1
rather than blur partisan boundaries , what @entity46 democracy needs is a healthy dose of responsible partisanship			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely thoe of @entity260 .			2

@entity1 , a @entity16 , endorsed @entity7 for re-election
@entity260 : some mourn loss of moderate @entity16 but *sharper* partisan lines are good
he says a liberal party and a conservative party enable voters to express preferences
@entity260 : to avoid *gridlock* , parties should be given more power over *members* of @entity209
