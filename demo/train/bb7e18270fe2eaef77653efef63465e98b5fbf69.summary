-- more than 200 indigenous people who refused to vacate their land in eastern @entity4 were sprayed late last week with what some believe was pesticide , sending seven to the hospital , a government cabinet member said this week			1
the 217 members of the @entity11 community in the @entity13 district suffered vomiting , diarrhea , headaches and nausea , said @entity18 , @entity4 's minister of health			1
although one person was in serious condition , she said monday , the rest are improving			0
" for us , it 's very clear that this is an acute community - wide intoxication caused in a premeditated manner by an unknown substance , " @entity18 said on her ministry 's web site			0
" but it is very clear because all of the similar symptoms occurred after this incident			0
" the @entity35 human rights organization said tuesday it " condemned the use of apparently toxic pesticides to intimidate an indigenous community after they resisted being forcibly evicted from their ancestral lands			2
" the tension in @entity4 is identical to that found in other parts of @entity44 , where the rights of indigenous communities collide with the business interests upon which nations ' economies depend			1
the traditional ancestral homes of indigenous communities are sought for use by mining , oil , logging , agricultural and ranching businesses			2
some in @entity4 say that legal protections often are not enough			1
" a new constitution recognizes indigenous rights , but political reality is proving to be quite different from the constitutional ideal ; the problems facing @entity4 's indigenous people are not likely to go away anytime soon , " the @entity59 's @entity58 and @entity60 said in a 2006 study			1
" the economics and politics of @entity4 make sustained improvement unlikely			1
" government critics say not much has changed in three years			0
" indigenous peoples ' lives are being put in jeopardy by those who should protect them , " said @entity72 , @entity4 researcher at @entity35			1
" the risk faced by the @entity13 communities was predictable			0
insufficient action was taken to protect them from the threats they faced from this renewed attempt to evict them from their ancestral lands			0
" the latest incident occurred friday near the border with @entity89 , when more than 200 @entity11 community members refused to leave land local soy growers say belongs to them			1
an eviction order against the indigenous people was supposed to be carried out friday , but a district prosecutor canceled the mandate right before it was to be executed			2
" and , according to what the indigenous said , that apparently angered the soy growers , who went there to try to remove them , " @entity4 health minister @entity18 said			1
" they went in trucks to try to forcefully remove them			0
" @entity35 said the @entity11 fought back against the 50 men who tried to evict them			2
" the indigenous peoples resisted using bows and arrows , " the rights group said in a release tuesday			0
police were present , which limited the fight , @entity18 said			0
" afterward , " she said , " came a low - level flight by airplanes where the people were working in their fields , in their community orchards , with the spraying of a liquid over the people who were there , who later presented with massive symptoms			0
" officials are investigating who may have been responsible , she said			0
@entity35 urged @entity4 officials to step up their efforts to protect the indigenous communities			1
" the @entity4 authorities -- the executive , congress and the judiciary -- must work together to address the immediate needs of the communities after this attack , but also to ensure that it does not happen again			2
the native populations have been losing ground since the 1700s			0
" as agriculture and grazing came to occupy larger and larger tracts of land , the traditional subsistence foraging and hunting of most of the groups could not support their numbers , and they were forced to take extremely low - wage jobs , " the @entity59 's conflict and development group says			0
" indigenous peoples throughout @entity4 are among the very poorest of society			1
" indigenous communities also were legally disenfranchised , the study said			0
" until the 1960s , only one law addressed the future of indigenous groups in @entity4 , and well into the 1970s it was not a crime to kill ' @entity161 , ' " the university study said			1
some recent government efforts to help indigenous communities have been tied up in courts			0
" in 1996 and 1997 the @entity165 , the state body that advises on protecting indigenous peoples ' rights and processing land claims , acquired 2,638 hectares ( 6,518 acres ) of the indigenous communities ' ancestral land on their behalf , " @entity35 said in a recent release			2
" however , landowners have taken legal action against the five communities			0
" more recently , the @entity175 ordered @entity4 in 2005 and 2006 to return ancestral lands to two indigenous communities			1
it was not clear tuesday whether that order had been carried out			0
the @entity59 study points out that the indigenous population of @entity4 consists of 17 ethnic communities divided into five linguistic groups : the @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity11 and the @entity186			1
these communities live on either side of the @entity189 , in the sparsely populated @entity190 to the west , and along the @entity89 border to the east			0
less than half of the indigenous population remaining in @entity4 lives in the @entity190 ; fewer groups , related to the @entity11 , remain in the east			1
about 95 percent of @entity4 are mestizo , of mixed @entity200 and @entity201 ancestry , the @entity198 says			2
the official language of @entity4 is @entity200			1
however , the university report said , the majority of @entity4 's 7 million residents speak @entity11 better than they speak @entity200			1
@entity200 is used mainly in public speech , while @entity11 is used in everyday speech			2
the 1992 constitution stipulated that all government documents be published in @entity200 and @entity11			2
but despite the general population 's fluency with @entity11 , the study said , @entity4 do not consider themselves of @entity161 descent and their culture is thoroughly hispanicized .			1
