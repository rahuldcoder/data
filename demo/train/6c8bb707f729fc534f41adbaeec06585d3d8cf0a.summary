-- responding to president @entity2 's @entity4 comments about the " deep and corrosive doubts about how @entity6 works , " house speaker @entity1 said that " the @entity8 people do n't care about process			1
" yet @entity8 have indicated that they are quite unhappy with how their government is working			1
according to a recent @entity14 / @entity13 poll , only 28 percent of those polled believe that the federal government is " working well , " while seven out of 10 believe that the " unhealthy " government is in need of reform			2
almost 93 percent said there was too much partisanship ; 84 percent said special interests had excessive power			1
we must always take these kinds of poll numbers with a grain of salt			0
polls frequently show that @entity8 do not like how their government works , especially @entity28			2
the @entity8 is a country that has always expressed strong distrust of government			2
there have been a few exceptional periods , like the progressive era or the 1960s and 1970s , when this frustration turns into a concerted movement for government reform			2
during the 1960s and 1970s , @entity38 and @entity39 concluded that much of their policy agenda would be impossible to achieve if the political process did not change			1
they perceived @entity42 and then @entity43 as the outgrowth of deep flaws in how our government worked			1
during the 1970s , they were able to pass a series of significant reforms , such as a campaign finance system that included public funds for presidential campaigns and contribution limits			1
reforms opened up more of the political process through sunshine laws and retrenched the power of the senior committee chairmen in @entity28 who had usually done as they pleased , ignoring the will of the majority			1
ethics laws regulated the behavior of executive and legislative branch			0
even the sacrosanct filibuster underwent an overhaul in 1975 : the @entity68 lowered the number of required to end a filibuster from two - thirds of the @entity68 , 67 ; to three - fifths , 60			2
many of the reforms did not work , some had unintended consequences , and others were gradually unraveled			1
but substantive reform was possible and , for a moment , changed the way that politics as usual worked			0
in addition to diminishing citizens ' trust in government , the flaws of the political process constrain and limit what kinds of policies are even possible			1
if president @entity2 , @entity38 and @entity39 are serious about building trust among citizens and creating a more productive political process , they should work together to do something about it			1
if @entity6 is serious about reforming the political process , three specific areas deserve immediate attention			1
filibuster reform : the 60 - vote supermajority @entity68 has become dysfunctional			2
both parties have expressed frustration with their inability to move legislation through the process			2
both parties have used the filibuster as a normal tool of procedural warfare			0
because of the rampant use of the filibuster since the 1960s , senators expect that 60 votes are now required on almost every piece of legislation			0
one option would be to switch to a majority - based system in which 51 votes can end debate			0
another , more feasible , option would lower the number of senators required for cloture to 55			0
to improve the political prospects for any change , some observers have suggested that any reform would not take effect until after the 2012 election			1
making it easier to end a filibuster is one of the most important concrete steps that @entity28 could take to actually diminish partisanship			1
the sources of partisanship are deep - rooted and hard to change			1
but filibuster reform would disarm both parties by weakening or removing one of their most powerful weapons			0
campaign finance reform : a recent @entity145 decision eliminated many of the barriers to corporate donations and third - party advertising			0
the power of private money in campaigns has been a huge political issue for over a century			0
because politicians depend on interest group support to obtain funds for their campaigns , they constantly find themselves constrained when it comes to making policy			0
the influence of private money also diminishes public trust in government			1
every story about another lobbyist like @entity167 confirms their worst fears about corruption			0
it is not difficult to understand why @entity28 has crafted a health care bill that avoids making any huge changes to the basic infrastructure of the health care industry			0
according to the @entity179 , citing the @entity176 , the health care and insurance industry spent at least $ 648 million on lobbying in 2009 -- and 20 percent of the year - end reports were not in yet			0
pharmaceutical companies spent about $ 245 million , which the @entity179 said was more than any other single industry has ever spent lobbying on behalf of any issue			0
several changes have been discussed in recent years			0
the administration has talked about placing certain kinds of fund - raising restrictions on companies that do business with the government			0
a second proposal is to build on local and state reforms by providing matching public funds to candidates who raise a certain minimum of private donations			1
in the end , offering an alternative source of funds to candidates and parties is the only way to change the system , or candidates will be forced to keep going back to the well of interest group money			1
congressional earmarks and tax breaks : pork - barrel politics is as @entity8 as apple pie			1
but in recent decades , the system by which legislators pass appropriations targeted to key interests has become pervasive			1
legislators are comfortable putting provisions that are tailor - made for lobbyists or particular interests into bills			0
these earmarks are not subject to hearings or oversight			0
the use of earmarks by @entity226 to close the health care legislation that passed last month made the public uneasy			2
the other way in which @entity28 distributes hidden benefits is through tax breaks			0
during the 1960s , reformers named these " tax expenditures " to convey the point that the government essentially spends money by forgiving certain groups of their obligation			2
we have not had a major tax reform initiative since 1986			0
the time has come to clean out the tax code once again and reduce the number of provisions that are in the law			2
there is also bipartisan support for reforms that would limit the use of earmarks by legislators and make certain that they are fully disclosed upon being requested			1
although voters tend to be more interested in bread - and - butter issues , as well as questions about war and peace , there are a few exceptional moments when public anger about the political system becomes so intense that we enter into a period of substantive reform			1
we might be reaching one of those points , but in the end it will require the initiative of the president and congressional leaders to make sure that calls for reform are not just empty rhetoric			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity278 .			2
