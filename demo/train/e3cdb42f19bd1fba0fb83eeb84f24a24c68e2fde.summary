-- the timing could n't be any better , or worse , for @entity3 's film of @entity5 's novel , a sympathetic portrait of a gifted , intelligent young @entity8 whose love affair with the @entity10 dream ends in disenchantment , mistrust and violence			1
this would have been a provocative movie to release at any time since 9/11 , but especially so in the immediate aftermath of the @entity18 bombings			0
still , if we 're to come to any understanding of the terrorist mentality , movies are a relatively safe and responsible place to start looking			0
in the opening scenes , the @entity24 responds to the kidnapping of a @entity28 academic in @entity29 , @entity8			0
a @entity10 journalist who is also an undercover operative for the agency ( @entity32 ) is sent to interview one of the professor 's colleagues , a local whose classes are reported to be stirring up young @entity37 and who is a known associate of jihadists			1
@entity40 ( @entity41 ) agrees to talk , but only if the @entity10 promises to hear him out and get the full story			1
@entity40 , it 's not pronounced like the @entity46 song , but it could easily be read that way , starts out as if he means to become one of @entity50 's " @entity49 , " a @entity52 business grad whose ruthlessness puts him on the fast track at @entity55 , a @entity57 valuations firm			2
he even dates the chairman 's daughter ( @entity58 , valiantly trying to find roots for an elusive character )			1
the business saga is entertaining in a snappy , @entity64 finger - wagging vein -- @entity65 is in strong form as his steely mentor -- but things sour for @entity40 when the @entity69 comes down			0
suddenly the up - and - coming executive is being strip - searched at airports and advised to shave his beard			0
he 's treated like an alien and comes to feel like one			2
it forces him to rethink his own identity , his heritage and spiritual values and for the first time he questions the profit - motive that has driven his success			0
the film 's twin - track structure does n't really work : the lengthy reminiscences of the disenchanted capitalist completely overwhelm the present tense against - the - clock hostage drama			1
is @entity40 playing for time , to aid his @entity88 buddies ? @entity3 does n't seem interested in fleshing out that suggestion , and melodramatic scenes with @entity91 as the @entity24 field chief eavesdropping on the conversation fall well below the authenticity of " @entity95			0
" still , the exchanges between @entity32 and @entity41 -- an intense , edgy @entity98 actor some may recognize from the black comedy " @entity100 " and @entity102 's " @entity101 " -- do shed some light on the 21st century 's most volatile culture clash			1
in the starkest of these , @entity40 confesses that his first reaction to the planes hitting the towers was ... pleasure			0
it 's a brave acknowledgment of an unspeakable emotion , a moment that will repel many in the audience just as clearly as it disgusts @entity32 , but which is worth hearing not because it 's provocative , but because it rings true			1
there are hard shards of brutal honesty dispersed elsewhere too			0
when @entity40 and his @entity10 girlfriend first make love , she stops ; she 's still mourning the love of her life			2
" pretend i 'm him , " he urges , an impulse that does n't just speak to the male 's desire , but also to the immigrant 's need to fit in			2
and then , later , the other side of the equation , when , teaching in @entity29 , he challenges his students to articulate what a " @entity134 " might look like ... ? too prescriptive and too novelistic to fully come to life , at least " @entity139 " does n't demean its characters or its audience			2
it 's a dogged , thoughtful and well - acted movie that might have been more effective if it kept a narrower focus .			1

" @entity139 " is *based* on @entity5 's novel
the film stars @entity32 , @entity41 and @entity58
critic says it 's thoughtful and well acted
