-- the horrific events in @entity2 are unfathomable			1
asking " why ? " is natural at times like this , but intuitively it is clear that there can not be any good reason for what was truly a senseless massacre			1
it is impossible not to grieve with the families in @entity2 , @entity11 , who have experienced such tremendous loss , just as it is impossible to not hope for anything that can provide some comfort			1
all of us who have had children in primary school at one time or another stopped in our tracks when we heard the news , just as president @entity24 did , as we tried to imagine how we would have coped had something so horrendous happened in our own child 's school			0
but why must the nation grieve with @entity29 ? after @entity2 , a memorial service was held in which 10 clergy and @entity24 offered @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity36 prayers , with the president stating : " ' let the little children come to me , ' @entity38 said , ' and do not hinder them			1
for such belongs to the @entity41			0
' @entity29 has called them all home			0
for those of us who remain , let us find the strength to carry on			0
" why must it be a natural expectation that any such national tragedy will be accompanied by prayers , including from the president , to at least one version of the very @entity29 , who apparently in his infinite wisdom , decided to call 20 children between the age of 6 and 7 home by having them slaughtered by a deranged gunman in a school that one hopes should have been a place of nourishment , warmth and growth ? we are told the @entity64 works in mysterious ways but , for many people , to suggest there might be an intelligent deity who could rationally act in such a fashion and that that deity is worth praying to and thanking for " calling them home " seems beyond the pale			2
let me be clear that there may be many grieving families in @entity2 and around the country who have turned to their faith for solace in this difficult time			1
no caring person would begrudge them this right to ease their pain			0
but the question that needs to be asked is why , as a nation , do we have to institutionalize the notion that religion must play a central role at such times , with the president as the clergyman - in - chief ? since this tragedy , cable tv networks have been flooded with calls to faith and have turned to numerous clergy as if , as a matter of principle , they have something special or caring to offer			1
often what they provide is quite the opposite			0
on @entity0 the other day , bishop @entity107 of the @entity108 suggested that people who do n't have faith in his deity can only go so far in our emotional capacities to love and forgive , that without faith " we lack the strength to take us the full way of ourselves , the best of ourselves			2
" besides being offensive , this is nonsense			0
we do n't need faith to empathize with the grieving in @entity2			1
we can feel real connections , whether we are parents , or neighbors of families , or simply caring men and women			2
and we can want to help simply because of our common humanity			0
why does television automatically turn to clergy for advice on how to meet our needs , spiritual or otherwise ? later on television , i saw media rabbi @entity133 , who used to claim to be the personal spiritual guide of @entity135 , until that presumably became less sellable			1
i also once had the displeasure of debating him on the subject of evolution , which he essentially rejects , offering admonition to those who , with very good reason , may question a @entity29 who could willingly allow the slaughter of children			0
i would argue that times like these are very good times to question your faith in deities			2
television host and former presidential candidate @entity153 suggested that because we are keeping @entity29 out of schools , the @entity155 chose not to stop the slaughter of these young innocents			0
( or , to put it more bluntly , " if you do n't invite me to the party , i will kill your kids ! " ) if this were remotely believable , who would want to pray to such a fickle and pompous deity ? i feel particularly sad for the grieving parents who might not be @entity34 , @entity169 or @entity36			0
besides learning that they are somehow lacking in empathy or goodness or the ability to heal , little guidance is being provided to those who among them have decided that they can not believe in a sometimes violent and irascible @entity29 or who in fact have found their faith in @entity29 in question as a result of this tragedy			2
for these people , as for me , the thought that @entity29 has " called their children home " is simply offensive			0
why ca n't we as a nation focus on consoling the families in their grief by focusing on the most important realities , the lives of the children they have lost , celebrating their memory and sharing our common love of family , of children , and of our common humanity and perhaps most importantly arguing that this tragedy may one day not be completely in vain : that a shocked nation might rationally decide that assault weapons are meant to kill many people in a short time , not to hunt for deer or defend one 's home			1
if instead of automatically assuming that prayers to a deity callous enough to allow this sickness , or worse , to encourage it out of divine retribution , are what families in grief need from their president and from the media , that we focused on rational grief counseling and community support , including better mental health care combined with sensible gun control , we as a society might ultimately act more effectively to stop this madness			1
the opinions expressed in this documentary are solely those of @entity229 .			1

@entity229 : the horrific shootings in @entity2 were a senseless massacre
he says the nation grieves with the families in @entity2 who experienced tremendous loss
@entity229 : why should the *framework* of national grief be focused on religious faith ?
he says clergy , asked by media for comment , have often fallen short
