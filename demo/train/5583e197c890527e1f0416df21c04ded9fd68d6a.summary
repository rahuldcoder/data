-- it 's been framed as a debate between web freedom and the freedom from stumbling upon potentially offensive content			2
in recent weeks , several companies have been forced to grapple with sexually explicit images appearing in their popular mobile apps			1
such images , a small fraction of the apps ' user - generated content , place these companies at risk for being banned from portals such as @entity16 's @entity15 , where millions of people gain access to the mobile web			1
but some observers see something more at play here			0
" in this debate , some may focus on freedom and others may focus on the harm of adult content , but what 's really happening here is the crystallization of the power of platform providers -- @entity16 , @entity36 , @entity37 and even @entity38 , " said @entity34 , a tech - industry analyst at @entity35			1
" these companies are free to set their own standards in the interest of their customers , even if that means that they ' censor ' some content in service of other content			1
" the most high - profile episode happened last week after @entity51 unveiled @entity52 , a mobile app that lets users shoot and post looping , six - second video clips			2
it took off with users even quicker than folks at the social network expected			0
and , as such , @entity52 quickly became a victim of what has colloquially become known as the @entity62 's @entity61 -- " if it exists , there is porn on it			1
" racy video clips , including one that accidentally popped up in the app 's " @entity68 " section , led @entity51 to make it harder for users to seek out adult content using hashtags like # porn and # naked			1
before that , @entity16 had removed @entity52 from its " @entity75 " section in its @entity15 , the only place @entity52 is currently available			1
on wednesday , the age rating for @entity52 in the @entity15 was raised from 12 + to 17 + , roughly the equivalent of a movie 's rating being changed from @entity80 to the more restrictive @entity81 to download the app users must tap a window vowing they are over 17 , although there is no verification system			0
a week earlier , @entity16 banned 500px , a photo - sharing app , because it said users could easily access sexual images			1
the app 's creators argued that 500px 's only adult images were a small number of artistic nude photos			1
@entity16 eventually restored the app , but only after 500px agreed to raise its age rating from 4 + to 17 +			1
in the wake of those two moves , @entity97 , the widely popular blogging platform that includes some porn among its roughly 92 million blogs , similarly reclassified itself with the 17 + tag			2
the significance here , some say , is that the @entity107 is increasingly becoming a mobile one			2
in the @entity110 , 45 % of people owned a smartphone last year , which is more than owned an older - style " feature phone			0
" that 's not to mention the millions more worldwide using tablets and other devices as their main entry point onto the @entity62			1
" if @entity118 were a country , it would be in the top 10 largest countries in the world with more than 100 million citizens , " @entity34 said			0
" this is more evidence that platforms like these companies are becoming more important than governments in some respect			2
" if those mobile - device owners are n't using @entity16 products , they probably use @entity36 's @entity132 system , or @entity37 's or @entity133 's			1
so , all of a sudden , we 're putting big decisions about what we can and ca n't see into the hands of for - profit companies			0
that has some observers worried			0
yes , virtually all mobile devices have a web browser that lets the user get to the rest of the @entity62 's content , app store or not			1
but a single tap of a finger is a lot easier than thumbing a web address into a tiny browser			0
" there are some advantages to being an application , " said @entity153 of the @entity154 , a group that promotes digital rights			0
" to deny those advantages to certain kinds of unpopular speech does n't seem appropriate			2
" @entity16 ends up at the center of these conversations , both due to its prominence in the tech world and the famously tight controls it keeps on its " walled garden " of data			1
the company continues to argue for an experience that the late ceo @entity171 once described as " ( f ) reedom from programs that steal your private data			2
freedom from programs that trash your battery			0
" but critics , including some app developers , argue @entity16 's garden is n't policed in a fair way			1
why , for example , was 500px banned , but not the more prominent @entity97 ? has @entity16 leaned on @entity51 , which activists have lauded for its devotion to web freedoms , to change @entity52 's 12 + age rating ? " i 'm not saying that @entity16 is being malicious -- they have a billion apps in that store , " @entity153 said			1
" it 's not that they 're doing the wrong thing on purpose			0
it 's just too big a job for anyone to be expected to regulate all that			0
" he notes , though , that the bans have n't always been about porn or spam or inefficient apps			1
last year , an app that would have pinpointed the location of @entity110 drone strikes in the @entity205 was rejected multiple times			0
and two years ago , @entity209 - winning cartoonist @entity208 's app was rejected because it " contains content that ridicules public officials			0
" ( it was eventually approved after public outcry			0
) " that 's pretty plainly political speech , " @entity153 said of the apps			1
@entity16 did not reply to questions submitted for this article			1
but the company makes no bones about having tight controls on the @entity15			0
" if it sounds like we 're control freaks , well , maybe it 's because we 're so committed to our users and making sure they have a quality experience with our products , " the company writes in its @entity15 review guidelines			1
@entity36 has guidelines for its @entity230 mobile store			2
but they tend to be looser than @entity16 's			2
the @entity132 system also lets apps from outside stores be loaded onto the phones and tablets that use it			0
@entity36 also did not reply to a request for comment			0
that , of course , opens up the user to the possibilities @entity171 mentioned -- call it @entity132 's wild , and potentially dangerous , jungle outside of @entity16 's aforementioned garden			2
regardless of the specifics of their approaches , though , these companies are making decisions that , rhetoric aside , are never wholly about the end users ' rights or concerns			0
" their job is to make money by cultivating a base of customers , " said @entity35 's @entity34			0
" if they deem some content will harm that relationship , they are free to ban it			2
" as a result , traditional thoughts about government censorship or control are no longer relevant -- no matter how upsetting that will be to people on either side of this particular debate			0
