-- " do not be afraid , " @entity0 tells herself as she prepares to stride naked upon a moon - kissed @entity2 beach and consummate her marriage to @entity5			1
it 's been her credo through four films now in the boffo " @entity11 " saga , and for all the criticism that novelist @entity14 preaches good old - fashioned abstinence , it 's worth pointing out that this gutsy heroine has a habit of making up her own mind and going after what she wants , even if ( like everyone in her onscreen life ) we ca n't bring ourselves to wholeheartedly approve of @entity0 's determination to wed and bed a vampire at the age of 18			2
" breaking @entity27 -- @entity28 ( @entity29 ) , @entity5 ( @entity30 ) and his arch rival , local wereboy @entity32 ( @entity33 )			1
but fear not , the fat lady has n't sung just yet , and there 's still some life left in this domesticated gothic romance , even if you can feel it draining out before your eyes , drip by drip			0
it 's a rare series that improves the longer it goes on			0
" @entity48 " is too padded to compete with last year 's " @entity45 , " but on the other hand , the production values have gone up each time , the actors have grown more comfortable in their roles ( yes , even @entity33 ) and with each new film comes a new , more accomplished director			1
@entity52 , taking over from @entity53 , was a surprising choice for the job -- he 's best known for @entity57 fare like " @entity58 , " " @entity68 " and producing the @entity69 telecast a couple of years ago -- until you remember his breakthrough film , " @entity62 " ( with @entity63 as " @entity65 " director @entity64 ) , and before that a long apprenticeship in pulp schlock			1
@entity52 immediately makes himself at home , throwing in a sneaky tribute to " @entity72 " and milking the wedding sequence as if he means to outdo @entity75 and @entity76			2
( more trees ! ) it 's not all about the extravagance though : the cross-cutting as the couple exchange their vows is a lovely , simple touch that crystallizes the emotion of the moment			0
then @entity52 reverts to " lifestyles of the @entity88 and @entity89 , " with a ridiculously ostentatious and overlong honeymoon getaway			2
@entity91 : fans go crazy for the latest ' twilight ' unlike mrs. @entity94 , @entity0 is n't freaked by her monstrous other half			0
but the long - delayed and much - anticipated love scene does have a nasty sting in the tail : in @entity14 's world , it seems that sex is n't safe even within the bonds of marriage			1
it 's not the act itself ( " @entity112 " -- despite the bruising and considerable property damage ) but the after - effects , which i suspect most everyone knows by now include the prospects of a little bloodsucker running amok			1
having split the last book into two , screenwriter @entity115 struggles to parse enough plot to keep this episode on the boil -- or even simmering			0
the aggressive threats from @entity122 's wolf pack ring hollow , a lame attempt to inject macho excitement into the movie 's self - inflicted prolonged pregnant pause			2
@entity91 : a 3 out of 5 for this ' twilight ' a doggy powwow is easily the movie 's biggest unintentional howler			0
but mostly , @entity52 ladles on the atmosphere effectively enough with the now - customary indie - pop soundtrack ( @entity133 ; @entity132 ; @entity134 ) so up front we 're only a whisker away from a full - on musical			1
and he delivers the grotesquely bloody finale with something approaching operatic gusto			1
we 've come a long way since dads could escape labor pains by putting the kettle on and pacing outside in the hallway ; this scene could send birth rates plummeting			0
@entity91 : ' twilight ' more a social event than a movie critics will scoff , and this is n't a very good movie , but it 's been a while since i saw anything so deliciously delirious .			0
