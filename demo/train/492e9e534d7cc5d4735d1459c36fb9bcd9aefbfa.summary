his ribcage heaves up and down as a machine forces air into his lungs , screaming and beeping as it synchronizes with bags bringing him fluid and morphine			2
his four kids watch over him			2
his wife , @entity10 , squeezes my hand and says through tears : " he is going to die and i ca n't do anything			2
" i first met @entity10 weeks after our daughter , @entity16 , was born			1
my friends @entity19 and @entity20 had employed her as their caregiver and adored her affectionate way with children			1
@entity16 was lying in her playpen screaming , her eyes freshly opened			1
i raced around the apartment in my pajamas at 4 p.m. , trying to figure out how to breast - feed			2
@entity16 became calm almost as soon as @entity10 picked her up			1
" a baby is a like clean slate , " she said , smiling at our daughter			1
" i get to fill the slate			2
the only thing i ask is that you not get upset if i fall in love with her			2
some parents get mad , and i just ca n't help it			0
" she fell in love with @entity16			1
and my partner , @entity42 , and i fell in love with @entity10 , who brought so much more than help with diapers and cries of distress			0
@entity16 learned to eat and crawl , then walk , all on her watch			1
then she began to talk in @entity50 and @entity51 , thanks to @entity10			0
@entity10 formed this big happy crew with all the other @entity54 caregivers			0
@entity16 and @entity55 and @entity56 and @entity57 and @entity58 , a string of little ones right behind them , went on adventures to the water park yelling " agua , agua " and eating loads of rice and beans			1
suddenly , this little person emerged who had adopted our caregiver 's thoughtful , shy , demeanor , who ate more vegetables than we could provide and had this delicate humility that is missing in so many little kids			1
@entity10 had left their own babies behind in the @entity79 to come care for the babies of families in the @entity83			0
it 's a typical story line in the @entity54 immigrant community			1
@entity10 and her husband , @entity86 , wanted their children to have more opportunities , so they suffered a wrenching separation			0
@entity10 helped the babies of more privileged folks thrive while hers remained on an island , struggling with poverty			0
@entity86 worked in restaurants , and eventually , they brought four children to this country , all of whom are now on the brink of citizenship			0
@entity16 was just beginning to talk when she accompanied @entity10 and her children to a critical appointment with their immigration lawyer			1
i still remember the story of how each of them identified themselves one by one -- @entity86 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 -- and @entity16 would say " @entity114 , too			1
" she had truly become a part of their family			1
when we were finally able to tear ourselves away from our little girl , she spent a few weekends at their house and was indignant to find out that @entity10 and her husband shared the same bed			0
she wanted to sleep in between			0
@entity16 called @entity125 " and adopted a @entity79 accent			1
she credited them with her first trip to @entity128 's and talked about the @entity129 since they lived in the @entity130			1
@entity10 and @entity86 's grandson is close to @entity16 's age			1
so when @entity16 got into a great private preschool , i arranged for him to attend as well			1
how could i ask her to take my child to this great preschool when her grandson , @entity137 , did n't have a school ? @entity86 had no health insurance and did n't qualify for government programs			0
so when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer , the prognosis was grim			0
i put out a call to the @entity144 , that ethnic network that activates when there 's trouble in a family			1
i called @entity58 and @entity149 , @entity150 and all the @entity151			0
if they did n't know someone , they knew someone that knew someone , a doctor or a lawyer or a nurse , or a guy with a big van who can move a wheelchair			0
or they offered money to a family that has none			1
soon , this ailing man with no health insurance was sitting in @entity172 getting chemotherapy and kind words			0
everyone did everything they could , and then some			0
the two boys and youngest daughter increased their work hours even as they struggled to pay for college			1
the other daughter trekked her son and newborn daughter over every day to help care for her father			2
still , the cancer spread and their finances deteriorated			0
all the families whose children and sitters were connected to @entity10 stepped in to help cover her hours and help with finances			0
family members were able to take shifts , sitting by his side			2
@entity10 cared for him all night and all morning , before caring for my child and two others			0
she picked up every hour of work she could bear to make up for his lost income and prayed and prayed and prayed			0
on wednesday evening , we sat our daughter down to tell her that " @entity125 " had died			2
that her beloved @entity10 and her children will be very sad , and we will need to give all the help we can			0
we told her , as she cried softly , that every person is born and that every person dies , you just do n't know when			0
that it 's sad , but that all you can do is live your own life well and remember them fondly			1
we also told her that we are all in this life together .			2

@entity217 , a caregiver , has had a *positive* influence on @entity221 's life
@entity221 credits @entity1 with helping her daughter , @entity16 , to grow
@entity16 has also become a part of @entity1 's family
