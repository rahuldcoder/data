-- @entity1 said it has launched an investigation into the 15 - vehicle wreck that claimed the life of driver @entity5 and expects to have preliminary findings within weeks			1
the organization said wednesday individual members of various motorsports bodies will help it determine factors involved in the fiery incident sunday at the @entity12			2
@entity1 said it had incorrectly stated tuesday that the @entity13 of the @entity14 ( @entity15 ) and the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) , the national and international governing organizations , were formally involved in the investigation			2
the violent crash raised fresh questions about safety , both in motor sports , generally , and at the @entity12 track , specifically			2
@entity5 , a two - time @entity23 winner , had been pressing efforts to address such concerns			1
in an early october story posted on @entity28 , the racing series ' official website , @entity1 vice president @entity26 singled out the 33 - year - old driver , his team and @entity34 manufacturer @entity33 for their efforts to fine - tune a safer car model for the 2012 season			1
weeks ago , @entity5 was behind the wheel of a new prototype car for the @entity1 racing series -- one meant to make his sport safer			1
" he 's focused on what 's been needed from him to provide for the feedback to @entity33 and be consistent and concise , " @entity26 said then of @entity5			2
" you could n't have asked for more			0
" had he won sunday 's race , the @entity48 with the ready smile and engaging manner would have earned a $ 5 million payout			1
instead , he was near the back of the 34 - car field when he got mixed up in a crash that featured numerous cars spinning out of control and bursting into flames , spewing smoke and debris			0
@entity1 on tuesday said it was saddened by @entity5 's death			1
" the safety of our drivers , their crews , @entity1 staff , racetrack staff and spectators is always our paramount concern , " @entity1 said in a statement , declining to comment further on the probe			2
a public memorial service for @entity5 will be held on sunday at the @entity73 in downtown @entity74 , @entity1 said			1
a fund has been established to help provide for his family			0
@entity5 was survived by his wife , @entity79 , and two young sons			0
two drivers seriously injured in the wreck -- @entity83 and @entity84 -- were released monday from the @entity85 in @entity12 , said @entity1			1
@entity5 's death was the first for the @entity1 circuit since march 2006 , when driver @entity89 was killed in a two - car crash while warming up for the season - opening race at @entity92			1
one of the most famous racing deaths was that of the elder @entity95 in @entity97 's @entity96			0
@entity99 senior writer @entity98 said monday that the sheer speed of race cars , and the minimal distance separating them , means danger lurks around every turn and on every straightaway			0
@entity5 , for example , was bunched with several other vehicles cruising at about 220 mph when sunday 's crash occurred			1
" the fact of the matter is , you 're dealing with very , very fast automobiles			0
they 're not heavy cars , " @entity98 said			0
" there is , unfortunately , an assumption of risk when you get into one of those race cars			0
" beyond questions about racing 's safety generally , the condition of the @entity126 -- and whether or not it was too fast and too crammed with vehicles -- was the subject of intense questioning in the hours after @entity5 's death			1
driver @entity132 told @entity133 that the track offered " nowhere to get away from anybody			1
" " this is not a suitable track , and we 've seen it today , " he said			2
the loop in @entity12 is 1.5 miles , one mile shorter than the iconic @entity140			0
at the same time , it is wider than many others -- such that more cars can run alongside , and potentially collide with , one another			0
@entity0 's @entity145 and @entity146 contributed to this report .			0
