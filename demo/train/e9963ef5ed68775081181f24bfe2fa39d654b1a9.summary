@entity0 -- what do the @entity2 and @entity3 have in common with @entity5 ? not much , unless you buy into the long - festering urban legend that they all shared the same residence in @entity10 , @entity11			1
but now , the two football teams are headed to a new $ 1.6 billion facility nearby dubbed the @entity14			0
and their departure may be the best opportunity to finally put to rest the endless stories that @entity5 is not " swimming with the fishes " in the swamps of @entity11			1
or is it ? the old stadium , which opened in 1976 and is often referred to as @entity23 , is being razed , with demolition beginning thursday			1
urban lore has it that @entity5 , the long - missing @entity27 leader , was killed by members of organized crime and buried in the end zone , or thereabouts , in @entity23			1
representatives for the @entity33 said that the field wo n't be dug up , but that the stadium will be torn down in large pieces and the land eventually will be a parking lot			1
is it possible that football and soccer players -- not to mention the hundreds of thousands of fans who have visited the stadium for concerts over the years -- have trod near the former union leader ? few urban legends continue to capture the imagination like the disappearance of a union boss with a murky past			1
the story is now a traditional butt of comedians ' jokes , and one should n't be surprised that in 2004 , the show " @entity53 " devoted a segment searching for @entity5			1
several areas of the field were tested , but nothing was found			2
if you listen closely , you can hear @entity59 kicking himself for not doing an hourlong special			0
a @entity62 search of " @entity5 " reveals many theories and opinions on the whereabouts of the controversial union leader , who was reportedly last seen in a suburban @entity68 restaurant			1
@entity5 skipped off to @entity69 with a " go - go dancer " one union official swore			1
the @entity72 claims @entity74 's @entity73 has revealed @entity5 's body in a large hidden compartment with a special concrete block			1
" crushed in automobile compactor " and " ground up at a meat processing plant and dumped in @entity80 " are some of the other theories			0
director @entity82 must be excited about the possibilities			0
so just how did @entity5 supposedly end up in the end zone of a football stadium in @entity11 ? according to one account , his body was mixed into concrete that was later used to construct the stadium			1
but why does this story seem to resonate and remain one of the top theories ? @entity93 , an author and former @entity68 police officer , says the rumors probably linger because the stadium is a well - known landmark			2
" it 's the @entity98 , " he said			2
" it 's construction , organized crime and cement			0
everyone wants to play on that			0
" @entity93 did his own research , and in his recently released book " @entity106 : the @entity112 of @entity5 , " he says the union leader was probably killed closer to home in @entity110 and disposed of in a crematorium			1
@entity113 is vice president of public affairs at the @entity115 , which oversees the @entity116			0
he says he 's heard it all before , and he dismisses the story by saying , " it 's a complete urban myth			2
" " there was this mob lore that the mob dumped bodies in the weeds before the stadium was built			2
the meadowlands region was ' the weeds			0
' no one has taken this seriously , " he said			0
" it would often come up because every so often , a mobster would write a book or a magazine article			0
i was here eight years ago when the calls came flooding in			0
" the rumor mill was so out of control then that a former publicity official recalled recently that the stadium posted a " he 's not here " message on its electronic billboard outside the stadium			2
the @entity147 office in @entity68 says the investigation of @entity5 's disappearance is ongoing			1
" we follow up on leads , " @entity68 @entity147 spokeswoman @entity150 said			2
the @entity147 office in @entity154 , @entity11 , does n't plan to send anyone to the stadium when it 's torn down			1
" nope " was the response from @entity154 @entity147 spokesman @entity158 , who says he 's fielded several recent calls from the media about the matter			1
" my question to you , " @entity158 replied about the seemingly lunacy of the question , " is why would anyone think we would wait this long			0
we would have dug up the 50 yard line during the @entity171 a long time ago if there was any credence to the rumor			2
" the issue of digging is very sensitive for @entity0 sports fans			0
during the construction of the new @entity179 , a construction worker , and @entity182 fan , buried a @entity182 jersey in wet concrete , hoping to hex the @entity185			0
the @entity185 spent thousands of dollars to dig up the jersey and , in doing so , perhaps averted a future curse and urban legend			1
superstitious ? the @entity185 won the @entity188			0
@entity1 's @entity189 contributed to this report .			0

lore has it that @entity5 's buried in the end zone , or thereabouts , in @entity23
with the stadium being razed , now may be the time to test the urban legend
field wo n't be dug up , but stadium will be torn down , land will become a parking lot
legend remains , but many , *including* @entity147 , say now 's the time to spike it
