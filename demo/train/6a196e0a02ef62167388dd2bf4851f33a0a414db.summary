@entity0 -- two @entity3 @entity2 in @entity4 are now running the oldest bialy store in the city , and keeping it kosher			1
@entity7 and his business partner , @entity8 , were shocked on hearing through a friend that @entity12 @entity11 and @entity13 was closing			2
@entity7 had worked at the store for 10 years in the 1990s and remembers it always being crowded , with lines out the door and people waiting up to half an hour for fresh bialys			1
so @entity7 and @entity8 bought the store to keep the 91 - year business alive			1
bialys are a lighter , softer cousin to the bagel , traditionally made with onion sprinkled on top			1
" i know bagels and my partner knows management , " @entity7 said			0
" if we work hard and pay attention , we 'll build up and bring more customers in			0
" @entity7 and @entity8 are keeping everything the same -- ingredients , equipment , recipes -- all used when it was a kosher store under @entity38 management			2
@entity7 is now on the hunt for a rabbi to come and give the store an official kosher certification			2
they even have some of the same staff , like @entity45 , a semi-retired baker who is still helping out around the shop			2
" i 'm glad we opened up again , " @entity45 said			0
" it 's good for everybody			0
" asked about seeing the store open again , after a short closure , one customer said , " it 's good			2
" according to the bakery 's website , @entity12 @entity55 was started in 1920 by @entity58 , who brought the bialy recipe with him from @entity60			0
the family continued to make hand - rolled , traditional bialys for 91 years			1
the business passed to @entity58 's son @entity64 and then to his son , @entity65 , who began wholesaling the bialys as well , shipping them across the country			1
then in august , @entity65 decided to close			0
" my son was going to take over , but with the area changing and business slowing down and the economy doing a double take on the recession , it was n't worth keeping at that point , " @entity65 said			0
@entity7 and @entity8 reopened shop in mid-september , and say that business has been going well			1
@entity65 is glad to see his family 's store living on			0
" i 've got no problem whether they 're black , white , purple , green , yellow			0
they came in , wanted to keep the business open and wanted to keep the industry going			1
... i 'm glad it 's still there			0
" and @entity12 @entity88 is still a family business , with @entity7 , his brother and his nephew all working to keep its traditions alive			1
" we 're sticking with kosher , " @entity7 said .			1
