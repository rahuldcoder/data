@entity0 -- squads of local government enforcers are operating in @entity7 cities without proper supervision , often employing brutal methods and carrying out illegal detentions , a new report from @entity3 claims			1
the 76 - page report , " beat him , take everything away , " documents abuses by the @entity16 units , known as " chengguan , " whose principle function is to assist regular police in tackling low - level crime in urban areas such as traffic violations and unauthorized street vendors			1
it says the behavior of " thuggish " officers has caused widespread public anger and undermined social stability			1
while they have the power to impose fines on violators , the chengguan do not have the authority to detain people or use excessive force			2
read the full report here but victims of chengguan abuse -- many of them street vendors -- describe being dragged , punched , kicked , and thrown from their vehicles to the street for no apparent reason , while others report being ordered to pay arbitrary fines or even being taken into custody without a reason given			1
one victim , a 32 - year - old migrant from @entity50 province , told @entity3 that three chengguan officers in @entity52 got onto her cart and without explanation began confiscating the grapes she was selling			1
when she protested , they began kicking and cursing her			0
they said " f * * * your mother			0
you dare ask us for a reason ? " last year , three officers from a local city management bureau in northeast @entity7 's @entity66 were arrested after a man died when he was attacked trying to lay cement outside his home , the state - run @entity62 news agency reported			2
no details about the fate of the officers were given			0
the @entity74 - based rights group claims chengguan have also been implicated in the forced eviction of residents from their homes " at a time when alleged collusion between corrupt officials and property developers has created what a @entity7 human rights organization has described as a ' pandemic of illegal demolition ' in @entity7			1
" @entity3 says the report is based on interviews with victims of abuse and other research in six @entity7 cities between mid- 2009 and 2011 , and builds on work documenting violations by @entity7 police and other public security forces over the past five years , including enforced disappearances , abuses in detention and torture			1
" one of the alarming aspects of the chengguan is that there is no clear national framework -- a legal one , a training one -- for supervising and disciplining the chengguan , " @entity102 , @entity3 's @entity101 told @entity1			1
" it 's up to the individual municipalities how to define and manage these forces , so it 's very unclear to whom they can be held accountable			0
" in november last year , the @entity115 issued guidance for its enforcement officers , according to a @entity119 report cited by @entity120			0
new guidelines prohibit officers from beating , abusing or insulting the other party , the forceful seizure of goods , forceful checks on vehicles , chasing vehicles and chasing people on foot			0
more than 7,000 urban management officers and 6,500 security guards and assistants would receive training on the new regulations , the article added			2
the @entity3 report comes at time when @entity7 's @entity139 is battling to restore a sense of unity and stability in the country as it prepares for a once - in - a - decade leadership transition			1
recent allegations of abuses by @entity148 authorities under disgraced former party chief @entity149 , and the controversy surrounding the treatment of blind activist @entity152 , have put the leadership on the back foot			2
@entity7 human rights activist @entity152 arrives in @entity155 @entity102 pointed to a similarly sensitive period for @entity7 's leadership as the country prepared to host the @entity159 , and it invested heavily in its security forces , giving them more resources and political power to reinforce their control			0
the rise of the chengguan , she says , is consistent with that strategy , though it appears to be backfiring			2
" part of the point we 're trying to make with this report is to say ' this force is causing instability by virtue of its brutal conduct , ' " she said			0
" it 's prompting violent reprisals on the street			0
if really what you 're looking for is policing in the sense of the way we understand it , this is not the solution			0
" a protest in @entity188 , @entity189 province in july last year was sparked by reports that local chengguan had beaten a disabled fruit vendor to death , @entity186 reported			1
the crowd clashed briefly with city authorities before eventually dispersing			0
the middle - aged street vender , who had a false leg , was chased by officers before he was attacked , witnesses reported in microblogs cited by @entity186			1
@entity7 authorities could not be immediately contacted for a response to the @entity3 report .			0
