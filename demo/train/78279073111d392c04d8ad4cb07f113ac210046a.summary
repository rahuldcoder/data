it 's a sunny afternoon at @entity1 , one of @entity4 's most popular outdoor music festivals , and 21 - year - old rapper @entity5 is making his first appearance			1
hands held high , excited fans crowd the stage to cheer for @entity5 , who describes himself as " the baddest boy " from his neighborhood , as he busts rhymes in @entity4			2
" i make good stuff but i never imitate			0
let me tell you a lil ' something about the hood i come from			0
" @entity5 is a @entity18 university student majoring in drama and film literature , but his true passion is hip - hop			1
he wants to become one of @entity4 's few professional rappers			1
" everyone i know , who 's really into rap music , will try to be a rapper , " he says			0
" it just feels natural for us to start rapping , to have the urge to make our own music			0
" @entity5 grew up in @entity33 , a small village that has become part of @entity18 's urban sprawl -- a topic that informs his lyrics			2
" where i come from , there ai n't no kind elderly playing chess in ( the ) cool shade , " he rhymes in one song			0
" only gamblers playing poker and bag - snatching thieves			0
" growing fan base @entity5 has been playing gigs at local clubs since beginning of the year and has built up a fan base among young @entity18			2
he also volunteers for a popular hip - hop radio show , " @entity51 " ( the park ) , where he make occasional appearances , and promotes his music through @entity4 social media platforms like @entity55 and @entity56			1
started by @entity59 ' @entity58 ' and @entity60 in 2006 , the radio show has been actively promoting hip - hop culture in @entity4 and holds gigs to provide stages for local rappers to perform			1
this year , they teamed up with the organizers of @entity1 to set up a stage especially for hip - hop artists			1
@entity4 's music festivals are usually dominated by rock bands and folk singers			2
@entity73 rappers like @entity74 and @entity75 have been popular since early 2000s but it was only after the @entity77 in 2008 that home - grown hip - hop found a fan base			1
in 2008 , @entity18 - based rap group @entity81 brought hip - hop to public attention with their " @entity18 welcomes you back , " a song dedicated to the @entity85			1
with its catchy rhymes and lyrics , the song went viral online soon after it was released			0
individuality college student @entity90 , 20 , has been fan of hip - hop music since high school and was @entity5 's back - up act at the festival			1
@entity90 says rap has become more popular among @entity4 youth in recent years because his generation has been raised to pursue individuality			2
the genre allows them to express their emotions more directly than their elders			0
" when i was in high school , i wanted to be different , " says @entity90			0
" and hip - hop music is stimulating , it made me feel excited though i did n't understand much of the lyrics			1
" he first listened to legendary @entity73 rapper @entity107			0
now his latest favorite is @entity110 - based @entity109			0
but compared to @entity73 rappers , @entity90 says he prefers @entity4 artists			2
" @entity4 rap shares a similar form with hip - hop in the @entity73 , but they 're quite different			1
hip - hop in the @entity73 now is more about entertainment			1
" " @entity4 rappers tend to tell stories of their everyday life , which i 'm more emotionally attached to			2
" at the festival , crowd favorites were about city life -- the demolition of a historic building to a traditional local cuisine			2
in cities like @entity130 in @entity4 's southwest , where residents prefer to use dialect rather than standard @entity134 , rappers use their local tongue			1
underground genre @entity137 believes hip - hop is getting bigger in @entity4 , with rap communities forming in cities across the country : " it 's very much like hip - hop in the early 90s in the @entity145 where you have a lot of people that like the music and a lot of people that are making the music			1
" but unlike @entity4 rock music , which enjoys tremendous mainstream popularity and huge commercial success , hip - hop still remains very much an underground genre			1
as @entity137 points out , its popularity has n't really translated into record deals and profits , especially for young artists like @entity5			0
" record companies ( and ) music festivals , they do n't know hip - hop and they 're not ready to gamble on hip - hop , " @entity60 says , " because of that , the artists struggle			1
" @entity5 , who 's in his last year of college , is willing to take a chance that the market for @entity4 rap will blossom			2
" while mainstream rappers , like @entity74 , have a huge fan base			0
underground rappers can also make a good living , " he says			0
but he also knows it 's going to be an uphill battle			0
" i can just focus on making music and leave the rest to time and destiny			0
" likewise , @entity137 and @entity60 are optimistic about the future of @entity4 hip - hop			1
they believe there will be more opportunities for rappers and more people to enjoy the music , with the new stage at the @entity1 just the start			0
" we had the smallest stage , with the biggest crowd			0

@entity5 is one of @entity4 's *emerging* home - grown rappers
fans say hip - hop allows a younger generation to express their individuality
lyrics are often about social *problems* and city life
an underground genre , there is little money to be made
