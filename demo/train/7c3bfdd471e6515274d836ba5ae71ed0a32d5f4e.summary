@entity0 -- everyone remembers the iconic image of @entity4 on her knees after the @entity7 women 's soccer team won the 1999 @entity8			1
@entity9 was only 17 then , inspired by the @entity7 women on the field			1
now , @entity12 , the goalie of the 2011 team , is poised with her teammates to repeat the drama of all those years ago			1
after winning several games in dramatic fashion , the @entity7 women face @entity19 sunday for the championship in @entity21 , @entity22			1
the 1999 team set the bar high , @entity12 told @entity1 friday			1
but she wanted to set the record straight : her team wants its own bragging rights			2
" twelve years later , this team wants to write their own storybook ending , " @entity12 said			2
" we want to end with our legacy and we are a very different team from the ' 99 team			2
so , you know , we do hope that looking forward , people remember the 2011 @entity7 women 's soccer team			1
" sunday 's game will determine what kind of lasting memories @entity12 's team will be able to etch , but it was hard not to know @entity12 's name friday			0
she became somewhat of an instant celebrity , especially on @entity45 , where a trending topic was " marrymehope			0
" she dodged the question about the topic on @entity1 's " @entity50 , " instead focusing on the team spirit that catapulted @entity7 to the finals			1
others may find it surprising that the @entity7 emerged as the new darling of 2011 soccer , she said , but not the team			1
" we came into this tournament with one goal , " @entity12 said			0
" it was n't to beat @entity61 in the quarterfinal			0
it was n't to make it to the final			0
our only goal of this tournament was to win the whole thing			0
i think when you get this close , you would have a lot of regrets if you walked away and you did n't win it all			0
" @entity19 may have world 's collective sympathy after the devastating earthquake and tsunami , but @entity7 is not going down to the sentimentality , @entity12 said			2
" this team is truly a team , and , as cliche as that is in sports these days , this team will fight until the bitter end to find a way to win , " she said			0
" it 's not always pretty but everybody on the field is trying to find a way to win , " she said			0
" i think it 's the @entity7 way			2
it 's the @entity7 spirit			2
i think @entity7 is so behind us because you can feel that spirit and you can feel the fight in our team			1
and people kind of grab on to that			0
" if they win sunday , the @entity7 women would become the first team to win the @entity101 three times , after taking titles in 1991 and 1999			1
just as she was inspired by the 1999 team , @entity12 hopes to awaken the thrill of soccer among the next generation of @entity7 women			1
" you ca n't not think about it when you see the kids come to our games , when you see all of the inspirational signs that are at the training fields , at the playing fields , " @entity12 said			0
" i do my best to be a good role model and i do my best to inspire people , especially the youth of @entity7			1
" she wants to give back , she said , because the fans instill confidence , give her joy			0
and that 's what will make her thrive come the all - important game sunday .			0
