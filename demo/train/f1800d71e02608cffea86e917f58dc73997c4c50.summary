-- maybe the @entity1 is more complicated than anyone realizes			1
we seem to exist down here in a kind of a moral and physical duality			2
the land gives up bountiful crops while it also grows vigorous weeds			0
there is no other valid explanation for the actions of either @entity13 or the @entity15 @entity14			1
@entity13 , a televangelist of butter , let slip in a court deposition that she had used a degrading racial term to describe @entity21			1
imagine the surprise of almost no one in @entity23			0
@entity13 came of age in a country that was just beginning to institute the equality it had been bragging about for almost two centuries			1
if her childhood was like most @entity1 baby boomers , she was raised on the lexicon of discrimination , and probably used it			1
un-ringing such a bell is not simple			0
passage of the @entity37 in 1964 meant that people who had been taught that it was socially acceptable to use terms like the n - word in public suddenly found themselves struggling with restraint on their language			2
unable to exorcise the term from their vocabulary fully , they took it into private quarters and used it among friends who had similar experiences and sentiments			0
it is grossly foolish , though , to dismiss @entity13 's stumble as a minor ineptitude with speech			1
in certain cultural circles in @entity15 , racism abides			1
and sometimes it simply forgets to close the door			0
in tearful interview , @entity13 slams ' horrible lies ' apologists racing to @entity13 's side are equally awkward in their articulations of defense			1
author @entity68 fretted about our " lynch mob " culture crucifying @entity13 , seemingly oblivious to the racial freight hauled around when using such a phrase to defend a privileged , @entity1 white person			1
less than 100 years ago a 17 - year - old black farmhand named @entity76 was lynched on the courthouse lawn in @entity78 , @entity79 , chained to a tree and burned alive			0
parts of his body were sold as souvenirs to a cheering crowd of 10,000			0
he had admitted to a murder many historians doubt he committed			0
how hard is it to understand that any ethnic person whose race has a history of being so victimized in a nation that espouses equality is likely to have a justified sensitivity to the bumblings of @entity13 , who had also expressed an offhanded interest in a " plantation - style " wedding dinner where the waiters were black males ? @entity102 : @entity13 and @entity1 food : critics say credit is past due @entity13 might have argued that her attitudes were forever altered when a black man robbed a bank where she worked in 1986 and held a gun to her head			1
but sympathy is a tough emotion to conjure when reading her 2012 interview with the @entity117 where she speaks of slavery as a familial relationship , not an injustice , and says , " ( @entity121 ) or that reason we did n't see ourselves as prejudiced			0
" she also used the same forum to suggest that the freeing of her grandfather 's 30 slaves was the cause of his suicide			2
consequently , it is disturbingly wrongheaded for comedian @entity133 to argue that what she said is " just a word			0
" words are powerful things			0
words have changed the world			0
regardless , it is still a bit awkward labeling @entity13 a racist when she had @entity145 and @entity146 on her program so frequently that the @entity21 barbecue chefs became stars of their own cooking show			1
it is probably a gross oversimplification to suggest @entity13 did n't know any better because she lives in two parallel and contradictory environments			1
no such explanation is sufficient for the @entity14 's ruling on the @entity157 , either			1
@entity13 's sons : she 's no racist the court 's perceptions are as confounding as @entity13 's			1
a conservative majority voted 5 - 4 that @entity163 used " outdated facts " to force mostly @entity1 states to seek federal approval for voting rules changes that affect minorities			2
we can infer from the opinion 's language that the problem of racial discrimination in the former slaveholding states has been mostly resolved			2
can we all share a " hallelujah " ? unlike @entity13 's mishap , this news will generate surprise among minorities , particularly those living in @entity79 and @entity181			1
the high court had already ruled that the @entity183 drew congressional district lines in a manner " designed " to discriminate against minority representation , which , not surprisingly , meant nothing to gov. @entity188 and his @entity190 , conservative legislature			0
they recently readopted the plan that had been ruled unconstitutional			0
the high court also has a kind of @entity1 duality that puts it at odds with its own rulings			1
a week before the @entity157 decision , the justices struck down an @entity181 law that required people to show proof of citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections			0
a judicial body that contradicts itself one week after a progressive ruling is struggling as much with the law as it is with the reality of the culture where it is employed			0
in the @entity1 , people understand how @entity13 and judges can be as wrong as they are right			1
unfortunately , there is considerably more at stake in this discussion than the buttery delights of a @entity1 cooking show			2
regardless of how much we debate and legislate ourselves toward equality , we have not yet arrived			0
@entity15 seems immobilized by its history ; we just ca n't stop staring at that tree on the courthouse lawn in @entity78			2
and we wonder why we still have n't got this right			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			2

@entity227 : complicated @entity1 gives us actions of @entity13 , @entity15 @entity14
he says @entity13 's apparent use of racist terms not surprising in region with racist roots
he says her generation used them behind closed doors with other whites and many still do
@entity225 : this duality in the way racism 's *vestiges* are *perceived* echoed in @entity14 rulings
