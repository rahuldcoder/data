" they 're riveting and emotional , with unique historic backdrops that lend themselves to the high - quality , dramatic event series we 're looking to make			1
" the projects are dubbed " event series " by @entity1 instead of the traditional term " mini-series			1
" the distinction : they 're longer ( 10 to 12 parts ) and could hypothetically extend beyond one season ( though the @entity16 project seems pretty self - contained )			2
the shows have notable auspices on board — @entity7 is from producers @entity39 ( @entity40 ) and @entity41 ( @entity42 ) ; the run of his life : the people vs. @entity16 , which chronicles @entity16 's 1995 murder trial , is from @entity48 ( @entity49 ) and @entity50 ( @entity51 )			1

a classic for the ages , @entity7 is both a cross-cultural exploration of @entity81 's journey away from the @entity93 way of life , and a star - crossed love story , as he falls for the magnificent @entity96 , the married confidant to @entity7			1
everybody remembers where they were when @entity16 , riding in a white @entity101 , led the police on a low - speed chase all over @entity104			0
this marked the emergence of the 24 - hour news cycle and the birth of reality television			0
