@entity0 , @entity1 -- a haunting moon rises over a darkened stage , bouquets of flowers masquerade as elaborate head pieces while a fair - skinned model smiles through a mask of colorful jewelery			1
welcome to @entity11 , a semi-annual fashion expo that aims to promote the @entity14 's burgeoning sartorial sector			1
alongside these elaborate and eye - catching runway shows , pop - up shops tout the latest designer accessories and fashionistas host forums on the latest industry developments in busy meeting rooms			2
although the @entity0 event only began in april 2013 , its founder has grand ambitions for its future and for fashion in the @entity14			1
" i would like to truly have our own fashion heroes , " said @entity11 founder and ceo , @entity30			1
" where every mall almost looks the same ... you really need to have your own home grown brands , " he added			0
established @entity38 labels such as @entity39 are already regular attendees at @entity11 as are smaller up - and - coming fashion houses like @entity0 's @entity43 line			1
the real yard - stick of the @entity46 's fashion success , however , will be whether the creations on display from the likes of @entity43 make it off runways and into popular stores around the region			1
those that can make this jump will find a lucrative market waiting for them			0
the luxury fashion and design sectors are worth more than $ 14 billion across the @entity46 alone , according to the consultancy @entity61 -- and that accounts for just a tiny portion of the global market			1
to tap into that potential , industry experts like the creator of @entity67 , @entity68 , say the region has to find a way to set itself apart			0
" there 's a lot of talent around the world but everybody is looking for something new , " @entity68 said			0
" even buyers in @entity80 and @entity81 , they 're all looking for something new that nobody else has			0
" " i often say that ( fashion ) editors and journalists , they 're like pigs sniffing for truffles			1
they 'll find it if the talent exists , " she added			0
but for many emerging designers in the @entity46 having the talent is only part of the process			1
some like @entity97 , a local designer who recently completed her first collection , say they need guidance and mentoring in order to fully realize their potential			0
" for a new designer , they need appropriate education so they 'll be able to understand the concept behind fashion because fashion can not be taken as a hobby , " said @entity106			2
" second , i think you need a coach or someone to help you along the way			0
and the third thing , you have to find a proper outlet for your designs			0
" creating that outlet for local talent is an integral part of @entity125 2020 , a long - term strategy that aims to make the emirate a global fashion capital by the end of the decade			1
at the heart of this process is @entity134 ( or @entity135 ) , a government backed entire business park just minutes away from the @entity137 dedicated to supporting these goals			0
@entity134 will include commercial areas , manufacturing facilities and work spaces for artists and designers			2
the woman at the helm of the company responsible for delivering the @entity134 project says it will be an eco-system to create jobs and nurture the region 's talent			0
" you have @entity81 and you have @entity80 , and you have @entity155 , the idea is not really to bring designers or mimic whatever they have there , " said dr. @entity152 , group ceo of @entity153			2
" we are very strong in attracting brands here but i believe we are also ready and have the right opportunity to also develop global brands from @entity0			1
" " i believe we have our own authenticity , and you know , and unique design and talent that could showcase			2
