if it does n't sound off with that iconic click - clack keyboard sound , is it really a blackberry ? the company behind the former market - leading phone says yes			1
and it is betting a big stack of their dwindling chips that both new users and diehard " @entity13 " devotees will agree			0
on wednesday , @entity14 ( who would simply be named @entity3 by the time the event ended ) unveiled @entity3 10 , a top - to - bottom overhaul of its mobile operating system			1
with @entity3 , struggling phone maker eyes comeback with it came two new phones			2
one , the @entity22 , includes the physical keyboard that most users , or former users , consider virtually synonymous with the brand			2
but that one felt like little more than an afterthought			0
it was the @entity30 -- a snazzy , touchscreen - only new phone -- that was used throughout the presentation to show off the system 's new capabilities			1
and @entity3 's website wednesday was dominated with plugs for the @entity30 , while the @entity22 , like an embarrassing stepchild , was nowhere to be found			1
forget the @entity30 simply having fewer buttons than older @entity39			2
with no " home " button , it 's got fewer than the @entity42 and most popular @entity44 phones , as well			0
the @entity30 is n't the first time @entity3 has tried a keyboard - free device			1
but it 's clear they 're putting more stock in it than the ill - fated @entity51 , which hit an @entity42 - dominated smartphone market with a resounding thud in 2008			2
from ' @entity13 ' to ' depressing ' : the @entity3 's 5 - year fall " the absolute best typing experience in the industry , period			1
" that 's how @entity3 ceo @entity58 touted his two new phones			2
specifically , with white virtual keys and a black background , it 's one that will be familiar to users of other smartphones , who @entity3 hopes to woo back home , as well as the brand 's current fans			1
" everything just feels like a @entity3 typing experience , " said @entity70 , head of software at @entity3			0
@entity74 , editor of @entity3 fan site @entity13 , says a touchscreen - only experience " may seem odd to some considering the majority of today 's 78 million communication - hungry @entity3 subscribers are using models with a physical keyboard			1
" but after demoing the device , he says he 's sold			0
" now that we have logged some mileage on the @entity30 , we 're getting it , " @entity74 wrote tuesday			0
" @entity3 has built a full touchscreen experience that even physical keyboard diehards will love			2
" 5 things that could make @entity3 10 a hit function aside , experts say that in 2013 bringing a touchscreen device to the forefront was something @entity3 had to do			0
" the @entity22 is really just a retro play to make sure they do not lose any of the 79 million users that still prefer the traditional @entity3 keyboard , " said @entity96 , co-founder of mobile - strategy firm @entity97 and author of " @entity99 of wireless : how to compete in the @entity106			1
" " the @entity30 is really the future vision , " he said			0
the @entity30 may not signal the end of the physical keyboard on smartphones , he said			1
but it could be @entity112 as the last holdout evolves			0
" @entity14 was caught off guard by this			0
now they are in the mainstream , with a touch interface , for the majority of the 1 billion smartphones in the world			0
only a small segment of enterprise users will continue to stay on the traditional keyboard model out of habit			0
