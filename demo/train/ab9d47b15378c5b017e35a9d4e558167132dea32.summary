at her research lab at the @entity2 , neuroscientist @entity0 turned her back to her study subject to check a reading on a computer screen			1
" hey @entity8 , look at this , " the patient called out to her			1
" i can move my toe ! " startled , @entity0 spun around			1
the purpose of her study , which involves sending electrical stimulation to broken spinal cords , was to learn more about nerve pathways , not to actually make patients move			1
that must be an involuntary spasm , she thought			0
she asked the patient , @entity19 , to lie down and close his eyes and follow her commands			2
" move your left toe , " she said to him -- and he did			1
" move your right toe , " she asked -- and he did			1
" @entity25 s * * * ! " she yelled out loud			0
over the next five years , @entity0 's team applied electrical stimulation to three more paralyzed men , and all four developed movement , and not just small movements			1
in addition to wiggling their big toes , they can lift and swing their legs , move their ankles and sit up without support			2
two patients can even do situps			0
their study , funded in part by the @entity42 , is being published tuesday in the journal @entity44			2
it 's not the first time electrical stimulation has made paralyzed patients move , but @entity0 says it 's the first time electrical stimulation directly to the spinal cord has shown voluntary activity			1
experts say this new technique is another piece of the puzzle toward helping paralyzed people walk again			1
and it 's another avenue doctors can go down to try to help these patients			0
brain - controlled devices may help paralyzed people " this is a breakthrough , " says dr. @entity60 , co-founder of the @entity61 to @entity62 at the @entity63 , who was not involved in the research			1
" it shows you can have a living spinal cord under the layer of their injury			1
" more than 1,700 paralyzed people have inquired about using this technology , which involves surgically implanting a stimulator and giving it directions with an external remote control			1
the stimulator creates a small , slightly visible bulge in the lower abdomen and is connected to wires that send electrical pulses to the spinal cord			1
but patients should n't expect that the stimulator will help them walk -- at least not now and maybe not ever			2
the stimulator can only make one leg work at a time			2
patients have to turn the stimulator off and then back on again to make the other leg work or to make another set of muscles such as their torsos work			0
even though he ca n't walk , the stimulator has had other benefits			2
@entity98 , the fourth patient to try the device , said he has dramatically improved bladder , bowel and sexual function			0
" that 's a difficult thing to go through life not having , " he said			0
" it just changed my entire life			0
it 's extraordinary and amazing			0
" plus , tests showed the patients , who could finally move their legs and torsos after years of paralysis , became healthier in general with improved heart and respiratory function			0
" if you can change health and wellness and life expectancy , to me that 's a home run , " @entity60 says			0
" remember , @entity120 died from complications of immobility , " the researchers are pretty much stumped as to exactly why electrical stimulation to the spinal cord created the movement on demand -- after all , they did n't touch the patients ' brains			1
perhaps , @entity0 says , the spinal cord in a way has a brain of its own			1
" maybe the spinal cord makes the decision to move on its own and then executes the movement , " @entity0 says			1
" otherwise i do n't know how you would see what we see today			0
" the @entity2 researchers now have funding to implant the device in eight more patients			0
they hope a device company will help them come up with a way to stimulate more than one muscle group at the time			0
" i think what 's incredibly exciting is we 've opened up a realm of possibilities of what we can do now with people who are paralyzed , and we 've just scratched the surface , " she says			2
@entity0 says she hopes to have more " holy s * * * " moments in her research			2
" i 'll never live that down , and now it 's the mantra of the lab , " she says with a laugh			0
polio - like illness found in five @entity166 children fighting paralysis , one milestone at a time			0

@entity0 was sending electricity down broken spinal cord to study nerve pathways
she was the one who got a shock when her patient called out : " i can move my toe ! "
@entity0 : first time stimulation directly to spinal cord has shown voluntary activity
technique is another piece of the puzzle toward helping paralyzed people walk again
