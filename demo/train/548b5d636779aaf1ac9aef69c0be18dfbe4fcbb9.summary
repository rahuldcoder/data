-- smartphone makers have long touted the appeal of their high - definition display screens			2
soon they 'll be able to add high - definition sound to the mix , too			1
" @entity15 , " also known as wideband audio , is a technology designed to make a caller 's voice , and other noises , sound on phone calls as close as possible to how they do in person			1
on monday , @entity18 vice president @entity17 confirmed that the company plans to roll out @entity15 later this year , making it the latest major player officially adopting a mobile feature that , unlike many in recent years , actually has to do with making phone calls			1
" @entity15 is part of our voice - over - lte strategy , " said @entity17 , speaking at the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , speaking of the next generation of cellular phone networks			1
in january , @entity30 announced @entity15 was available on a handful of phones including the @entity33 and @entity34 the carrier also said last month it will have @entity15 on the @entity36 , to be rolled out on @entity30 's networks in the @entity38 for the first time later this month			1
@entity39 has said it plans to implement the technology in 2014 and @entity41 has said it plans to make @entity15 an option on the @entity41 - exclusive @entity43			1
mobile carriers now have the ability to improve sound quality by transmitting it over their @entity49 networks , as opposed to the more limited telephone lines of the past			1
in simple terms , the human voice has a much wider frequency range than traditional phone connections have the bandwidth to handle			1
as a result , sounds that are too high or too low get compressed to fit			0
wideband audio is , as its name suggests , wider than traditional voiceband			0
it 's not as broad as the entire range of the human voice , but it 's closer			1
it might take a while before our on - the - go conversations are pin - drop clear , though			2
for @entity15 to work , both phones need to be equipped to capture and transmit the higher - quality sound			1
and , at least initially , they 'll need to be on the same network , though the carriers are working to expand that			0
wireless carriers have been rolling it out elsewhere for a couple of years , but only now is the technology beginning to be offered nationally in the @entity38			1
when @entity81 unveiled the @entity36 5 in september , the company announced that the phone is equipped for @entity15 and that 20 carriers around the globe would have the ability to offer it			2
but while it 's widely available in parts of @entity87 and elsewhere , the @entity38 has been slow to catch up			2
folks who have had a chance to test the feature have been impressed			0
@entity92 's @entity91 tested out @entity18 's version at the @entity94 in january and called it " really striking			2
" " background noise just drops out			0
the bustle of noises in a coffee shop ? gone			0
@entity100 announcements ? zapped , " @entity91 wrote			0
" even in a quiet room , voices become much , much richer ; i wo n't sound like a nasal @entity105 any more			0
" it 's really lovely			0
... but i 've seen this demo a bunch of times before			0
i 've seen this demo for two years			0
someone needs to actually launch the service			0

@entity15 , which improves voice - calling *clarity* , is coming to more @entity38 networks
feature expands frequency range of sound transmitted by phones
@entity18 confirmed its plans to add @entity15 later this year
@entity30 , @entity39 and @entity41 are also looking at the new technology
