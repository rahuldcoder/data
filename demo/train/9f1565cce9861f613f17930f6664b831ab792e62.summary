that 's how i would describe the producer , songwriter , musician @entity5 if i could only use one word			1
yes , he 's incredibly talented -- as co-founder of the production powerhouse @entity8 , he and his partner @entity9 have netted hit after hit			2
they have worked with everyone from @entity14 to @entity15			2
@entity16 to @entity17 most recently , @entity18 probably was n't a name you would have been familiar with until you heard this year 's biggest hit " @entity22 " featuring @entity5			1
yup , that was the @entity8 ' doing			2
and do n't forget about @entity25 's " @entity29 " the hit no. 2 on the billboard charts and which @entity27 described as " the @entity28 of 2013 "			2
it 's just another part of the @entity5 phenomenon			1
if you want to know more about @entity5 , you only have to look as far as the manifesto he wrote on his website			1
he says , " i serve and represent the others because i am one myself "			2
the " others " being anyone who has ever felt outside of the " norm " , anyone who has ever felt they could n't be categorized , anyone who has ever felt different			2
see who else has been on @entity46 it 's often safer to be inside the proverbial box			1
but it takes guts to not only say that the box is too small , but to go out and create a whole other space to be free and thrive			2
and that 's what mr. @entity5 has done			1
for him , the internet is that space			0
it 's a place where democracy rules but individuality reigns			0
ironic since here is a guy who has succeeded where very few can			0
he has been accepted by the establishment in music , fashion , art and architecture			0
he has become the man everyone wants to work with			1
in the research process and through our conversation i saw @entity5 as more than " the man of the moment " but a man with cross pop cultural influence			1
he showed me a roadmap to a non-predictable professional life , one in which his career is custom - designed and climbs no particular ladder			1
he speaks of a " collective conscience " where a " shift in humanity " means there are no ladders			1
instead , it 's about seeking alternate horizons by designing your own life and your own path			0
through his " i am other " initiative , ( which is now the umbrella framework under which all his projects operate ) @entity5 capitalizes on this shift by turning the consumer generation he influences into fellow entrepreneurs			1
he has created a forum where people can share and discuss ideas , thereby sealing his own position as a role model			0
he expresses his own ideas through music , movies , social media , and of course the internet			0
@entity5 calls it " a customization era " because " people want what they want right now			1
" @entity5 credits his diverse career to a lifelong curiosity that his mother instilled in him			1
she taught him to be open to all that is around him			0
from conversations with the renowned neuroscientist dr. @entity120 and their discussions on the psychology of music to collaborations with the artist @entity125 on a sculpture , @entity5 is a man who revels in cross-platform communication because for him , life is about maximizing existence in every way			1
for @entity5 though , the most important message he could share to his fans is his perspective on humanity -- it is one in which we all have something to offer and it is our duty to our self - respect to live life on our terms			1
the goal then would be to find a way to serve humanity through our given talents			0
@entity5 shared with me the one thing that stuck with him that @entity120 told him			1
he said " the apes and the monkeys reach for fruit , but man reaches for stars and that 's the difference			2
" through that wide - eyed wonder for all that this life has to offer , opportunities have made their way to him			0
he tells me " music has been the skeleton key that 's opened every door of every opportunity that ( i 've ) had			0
" well that may be , but it 's his humility and gratitude that make people seek him out			0
as he says , he takes his " ego 's hat off and ( leaves ) it at the door "			0
he is comfortable in his own skin and it shows			0
maybe that 's why his song " @entity174 " has already had over seven million views on @entity176			0
we all want some of that to rub off on us			0
i know i do .			0
