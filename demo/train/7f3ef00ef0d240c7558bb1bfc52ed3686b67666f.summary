since the early days of his first presidential run , @entity0 made a pledge -- to talk directly with @entity4 's enemies -- that most other politicians found naive			1
the approach famously drew snickers from @entity8 and @entity9 alike , who derided it as irresponsible -- a criticism that followed @entity0 into the @entity13			1
in the twilight of his administration , @entity0 's wednesday announcement on normalizing relations with @entity16 represented his last best chance to turn this idea into a doctrine that outlives his presidency			1
" @entity23 is hard — in our own lives , and in the lives of nations , " @entity0 said			2
" @entity23 is even harder when we carry the heavy weight of history on our shoulders			0
but today we are making these changes because it is the right thing to do			0
" the challenge for @entity0 has always been to turn lofty foreign policy concepts into concrete results			1
the administration is also working on a groundbreaking nuclear deal with @entity38 , which , like @entity16 , has been estranged from the @entity39 for decades			1
but those talks , while showing signs of progress , are n't complete and have been bogged down by details and domestic politics in both countries			0
taken together , @entity0 's approach to @entity16 and @entity38 could decide whether he leaves the @entity13 as a global statesman or as a president with unfulfilled big ideas			1
that dynamic is already playing out in the nascent 2016 presidential race			0
republicans looking to retake the @entity13 are slamming the @entity0 policy as reckless and say it leaves @entity4 less safe			2
@entity56 , a day after declaring he was exploring a 2016 run , called the move a " dramatic overreach " of @entity0 's executive authority			2
@entity61 branded the move as a " dangerous and desperate attempt by the president to burnish his legacy at the @entity16 people 's expense			1
" anticipating fierce blowback against @entity0 's moves , a senior administration official also stressed that the president would not tone down his calls for the protection of human rights and democratic development in @entity16			1
soon after moving into the @entity13 in 2009 , @entity0 instructed @entity76 's @entity75 to explore ways to promote an opening with @entity16 , by then being led by @entity79			1
but the capture of @entity39 contractor @entity81 a few months later put the process on hold			0
it was only when a deal was reached for the release of @entity81 on wednesday , and a parallel swap of intelligence assets between the two sides , that the wider initiative to engage @entity16 was unlocked			2
mirroring his approach with his bid to end the 30 - year standoff with @entity38 , @entity0 authorized a secret diplomatic track with the @entity16 in the spring of 2013 , senior @entity39 officials said on condition of anonymity			1
the first of a sequence of face - to - face talks which addressed the full range of irritants between the two sides took place in @entity105 in june last year			0
the @entity39 delegation was led by @entity107 , a speechwriter who has become one of @entity0 's closest foreign policy confidants , and @entity111 , the top @entity112 expert on @entity4			1
in retrospect , @entity0 's handshake with @entity79 at @entity115 's memorial service in @entity116 a year ago might have offered a hint at the high stakes diplomacy going on behind the scenes			0
but wednesday 's actions were clearly those of a president who , eying his legacy , with only two years left in office , is still chasing blockbuster political achievements that eluded his predecessors			0
" this is a legacy grabbing moment , " @entity128 , an expert on @entity16 at the @entity129 told @entity130			2
@entity132 , a @entity4 scholar at the @entity133 said the @entity16 initiative had the potential to flesh out a presidential resume needing big wins			1
" for a presidency that has at best modest achievements in the region ... to take the @entity39 to the pathway of normalization is a clear legacy for @entity0 , " he said			1
@entity0 's presidency has in many ways often been a quest for the dramatic ' @entity147 to @entity149 ' - style initiative — from his early calls for the elimination of nuclear weapons , his request for a " new beginning " with @entity156 nations in his @entity158 speech in 2009 and his drive for a nuclear deal with @entity38			0
but often , @entity0 's best intentions have been overtaken by chaotic global politics			0
the @entity164 uprisings and subsequent authoritarian crackdowns and civil wars rendered his @entity158 musings irrelevant			0
the rise of @entity169 has challenged @entity0 's claim to have ended the @entity172 war and the fate of @entity174 looks deeply uncertain following the end of @entity177 combat operations this month			0
other initiatives have also fizzled , like the much heralded first term " reset " of relations with @entity181 trashed by the return to the @entity183 of @entity184			0
@entity187 's @entity186 peace drive has failed			0
still , the @entity39 effort to promote political change in @entity190 has been a success — though is hung up on tricky questions of how much democracy the @entity196 nation 's military will permit			0
@entity16 has the potential to bolster @entity0 's reputation in the @entity199 , where regional leaders had been piling on pressure for serious opening toward @entity203			1
" this president is going to get an enormous amount of support from most of the heads of government in @entity4 , " said @entity128			0
the @entity16 bombshell is also another indication of the growing geopolitical opportunities opening up for the @entity0 administration as global oil prices collapse			2
@entity16 's leaders may well have been more receptive to @entity39 advances , given the fact that @entity219 , its patron in the region is tanking along with energy prices			2
another @entity16 ally , @entity181 , is seeing its own economy slump for the same reason and analysts said @entity203 may have decided that its best hope for economic stability may lie in closer ties with its old enemy -- the @entity39 -- in a twist of fate that gives @entity0 one more chance to make good on that promise he made back in 2007 .			1

@entity0 makes good on *vow* to engage @entity39 enemies
@entity16 offers hope to legacy needing big foreign policy wins
