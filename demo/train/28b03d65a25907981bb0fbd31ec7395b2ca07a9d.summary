-- when @entity2 named @entity3 as the host nation for the @entity6 finals , it vindicated the gulf nation 's continued determination to become one of the key players in the realm of sport by using its considerable economic resources			1
the decision by world football 's governing body was not met with widespread approval			0
traditionalists argued that the kingdom , with a population of just 1.85 million of which only 300,000 are @entity3 citizens , had never qualified for a @entity6 finals and had no discernible history in the sport			1
yet the power and influence generated by the oil - rich nation swung the vote @entity3 's way and , in 10 years ' time , football 's showpiece tournament will be played in an @entity35 country for the first time since its inception in 1930			1
the @entity3 influence in sport is growing year by year and , by the time 2022 is upon us , the portfolio of sporting franchises and sporting events owned by the nation will undoubtedly be even more impressive than it is today			2
in football , @entity3 own @entity47 club @entity46 and @entity49 giants @entity48			1
they also host major events in tennis , golf and cycling and are one of the five bidders to host the @entity57 , as well as establishing the @entity59 sports academy , one of the most prestigious facilities of its kind in the world			2
but why are @entity3 so heavily involved in the sporting world ? and what do they hope to achieve ? " when @entity3 discovered their huge gas reserves they invested millions in sport , raising their worldwide profile by buying athletes and footballers and giving them @entity3 citizenship , " @entity78 football expert @entity77 , author of the book " when friday comes -- football in the @entity81 , " told @entity0			1
" several @entity83 players were paid lots of money to switch countries , but this proved a disaster with the national team still failing to qualify for the 2006 @entity6 finals ,			0
" that did n't work , so the next way to qualify was to actually host the tournament and raise their profile by buying football clubs			1
now they are spending billions on its infrastructure to ensure @entity3 is synonymous with sporting and football excellence			2
" @entity101 , secretary general of @entity3 's @entity102 , offers an insight into why the nation , and its ruling royal family , is such a major force in the sporting world			1
" @entity110 has huge power and , for a nation like @entity3 that has such widespread diversities , in many ways it can put us on the world map , " he told @entity0 's @entity109 show			2
" when you organize a big event it brings people from all over the world into your country , and with that comes an exchanging of cultures and a lot of media coverage			0
" sports tourism is also a massive business at the moment			0
in @entity3 we are organizing more than 30 events a year and the economy being generated on the back of these events is massive			0
" another @entity3 - owned organization is tv channel @entity136			2
since its launch in 1996 as an @entity140 news and current affairs satellite station , the channel has expanded rapidly over the years and has now become a serious bidder in the tv sports rights market			0
this was illustrated at the end of last year when it outbid @entity49 pay - tv operator @entity147 to screen @entity148 matches exclusively in @entity49 for the next three years			0
having also won the rights to show @entity49 domestic league football from next season , allied to the ownership of @entity155 title challengers @entity48 , it is clear that @entity3 now has a huge presence in that country			1
football journalist @entity158 says @entity3 's influence in @entity49 football , and @entity48 in particular , is not necessarily a good thing			1
" the @entity3 influence in @entity49 football is massive at the moment , although it does seem to create a conflict of interest as they own the biggest club as well as also owning the tv rights to the league that club plays in , " he told @entity0			0
" there is no doubt that a revolution is currently taking place within the @entity49 game , but the @entity3 have been lured to @entity48 by the glamor and prestige of the capital city and there is a danger that the league could become all about that one team for many years to come			1
" @entity158 added : " we did n't expect @entity48 to dominate things so quickly but they are already splashing the cash , which is creating a huge gap between them and the rest of the clubs			1
" it was easy for them to take over a @entity49 club and lead them to the top straight away , it would not have been as easy in @entity195 , @entity47 or @entity196			0
" although @entity3 businessmen now have a strong foothold in @entity49 and @entity47 football , they remain without a key base in the @entity201 , which boasts the highest attendance figures in @entity204 football			0
however , according to @entity77 , that situation might change in the near future , with a massive @entity195 institution firmly on @entity3 's radar			0
and there is a near precedent following the 2008 takeover of @entity212 by an @entity214 consortium			0
" the @entity215 have been sniffing around @entity216 for a long time , " @entity77 said			0
" i have had conversations in @entity3 with prominent people and they have told me that @entity216 would fit their profile of wanting to use sport in general , and football in particular , to raise their profile to that of a world power			1
" the @entity226 family , who currently own @entity216 , will sell because they will get a better price from the @entity3			2
it is n't just a numbers or profit thing with the @entity215 , they want the institution that @entity216 stand for			0
" it remains to be seen whether @entity216 , or indeed any other many @entity195 club , comes under @entity3 ownership in the near future but , with a @entity6 and possible @entity237 both on the horizon , the tiny gulf state is only going to grow in sporting stature and importance over the next decade .			1

@entity3 is becoming a major player in the world of sport and sport finance
the cash - rich @entity249 state already owns football clubs @entity48 and @entity46
a @entity3 investment group has also been linked with a bid for @entity216
@entity3 will host the @entity6 and is bidding to stage the 2020 @entity237
