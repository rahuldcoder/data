@entity0 , @entity1 -- the first of the 33 miners trapped underground for more than two months could be hoisted to safety as early as wednesday , @entity1 mining minister @entity3 said saturday			1
he spoke hours after anxious family members and exhausted rescue workers reveled in joyful relief after a drill pierced the roof of an underground mine in @entity1 where the men have been trapped since august 5			1
sixty - five days after the mine 's collapse , officials announced the drill had reached the miners as sirens blasted through the site to signal the achievement			1
family members ran downhill , cheering and carrying @entity1 flags			1
what began as a " possible tragedy , with the help of @entity27 , is ending as a true blessing , " said @entity1 president @entity29			1
" the miners , their families , the rescue workers , the government and all the @entity1 have shown unity , strength , of faith , of hope , that is recognized and admired by the whole world , " the president said			1
" this shows that when @entity1 unite for great causes , regardless how grand or ambitious they may seem , we are always able to reach our goals and conquer the highest peaks			1
" still , despite the day 's success , rescue workers continue to face tough decisions and hard work to get the men out of the mine			1
" we have not yet rescued anyone and there is much ground to cover , " cautioned the mining minister , who also told reporters that the families of the miners " are aware of the process still expected			2
" later in the day , @entity3 said he believes workers could begin to hoist the miners up by wednesday			1
the rescue operation is likely to take around two days , he said , which would mean all 33 men could be pulled to safety by friday			1
also saturday , the miners successfully set off explosives in the mine to widen the rescue shaft through which they will be brought , @entity3 said			1
mine engineers decided to encase just the top part of the shaft with steel tubing to prevent rockfalls and further collapses during the extraction process			2
previously , they had thought they might need to encase the whole thing -- a process which would have delayed the rescue			2
@entity80 , vice president of @entity81 , the company operating the @entity83 rescue drill at the scene , told @entity2 , " i ca n't wait to see the first one to come out			1
" @entity80 said the ordeal has been arduous and emotional for the workers , but " we had patience " and solved problems methodically as they came up			2
" it was very exciting and also comforting that we were able to reach the tunnel after exactly 33 days of drilling , " said @entity80 , who noted that the miners are " happy " and " in good shape			0
" rescue crews have been drilling three separate wider holes to send down the rescue capsule and hoist the men to the surface			1
those rescue attempts have been labeled @entity101 , @entity83 and @entity102 @entity103 , owner of the @entity105 company that provided and oversaw the use of drilling bits for the @entity83 team , felt a " huge sense of relief and joy " and noted that the success was n't " in the bag until we were through			2
" " this project was unbelievably challenging , " said @entity103 , whose company , @entity115 , aided in the rescue of nine miners who were trapped for more than four days after the 2002 collapse of the @entity119 , also in @entity105			1
after the 2,300 - foot hole in @entity1 is secure , materials and equipment will be brought in so that the rescue capsule -- dubbed the @entity125 -- can be lowered into the mine			1
then , authorities will lower a doctor and a rescuer into the chamber , health minister @entity127 said			0
medical and rescue personnel will be in place to start extracting and treating the miners			0
once the men have been extracted , they will undergo about two hours of health checks at a field hospital set up at the mine			1
they will then be flown by helicopter to a hospital in the town of @entity0 -- approximately a 15 - minute flight			0
" you think we were happy , you should have seen those guys , " said @entity144 , one of the rescue drill operators , after saturday 's breakthrough			0
" they were just going crazy			0
i mean , imagine , that 's a big step towards coming home			0
so they were just going crazy			0
" miners who are healthy enough will be allowed to visit briefly with family members in a reunion area before being taken to the hospital , @entity127 said			0
health officials have increased the miners ' physical activity in recent days to gauge how they can handle the stress of being removed , the health minister added			0
the overall response has been good , he said , though some miners have exhibited anxiety or have had minor cardiac issues			0
the miners have been in contact with the outside world through a small bore hole that sends them food , water , supplies and other necessities			0
@entity29 said september 19 , during his last visit to the site , that he planned to personally hug each of the miners as they were pulled from the rescue shaft			1
he is due to depart on a government tour to @entity183 in mid-october			0
first lady @entity184 told reporters friday night that her husband was in the south			0
" he has a lot of obligations , " she said			0
" undoubtedly , he would like to be here permanently			0
but he also has to be permanently in a lot of other places and it 's necessary to continue governing			0
" she said the crisis faced by the miners has brought @entity1 together			2
" they have become very familiar to every @entity1 , " she said			2
" all @entity1 are equally expectant , equally nervous ; there 's a lot of empathy toward the families			2
" she added that the men 's liberation will occur " as soon as possible , " but only after every precaution is taken to ensure their safety .			0
