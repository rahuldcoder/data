-- as demand for the latest smartphones and other mobile devices soars to a fever pitch , more retailers are jockeying to snatch up older gadgets			0
electronics chain @entity7 , web auction house @entity8 and most major cellular carriers have either launched or ramped up their trade - in programs in recent months			1
each of them , along with myriad startups , wants a bite of the huge resale market			0
how much you get for an old phone or other gadget depends on a variety of factors , including its age , its condition and how in demand the particular brand is			1
for example , a newer @entity27 model will net you much more than a 3 - year - old @entity31 smartphone			2
retailers have a word for this cultural trend toward perpetual buying of newer consumer technology : upgrades			0
and as these consumers look to upgrade their hardware every year or two -- even if their current handset works fine -- they tend to build up a trove of slightly outdated gadgets			0
retailers are offering incentives to reclaim these past - their - prime phones that can be refurbished and resold , or passed off to overseas merchants			1
these buy - back retail services usually offer traders only store credit , rather than cash			1
also , all of these companies will recycle a gadget that 's too old to warrant payment			2
this is an especially attractive business for cell providers , which are always at risk of losing out - of - contract customers to other carriers			1
giving customers credit toward a new phone is an incentive for them to keep paying their subscriptions			0
cell carriers take phone trades @entity68 stores began letting customers trade in phones , including those from competitors , this month			1
the second - largest @entity74 carrier by subscribers is partnering with a company called @entity77 , which specializes in trading phones			1
to @entity77 , which carrier a phone is tied to is n't important			0
most of the company 's revenue comes from reselling used phones overseas			2
hot markets include @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , where people are n't as willing to pay top dollar for the latest technology			0
being able to take other carriers ' devices was a nice selling point for the @entity68 partnership , said @entity77 ceo @entity95			1
" it 's a great way to say , ' hey , we 're sorry you 're on our competitor 's network			0
bring that phone in , and we 'll give you some money for that			0
' " @entity106 , which launched its program in october , and @entity108 stores both take competitors ' phones as well			1
since introducing its buyback program in 2001 , @entity108 has taken 23 million trade - in devices , said @entity113 , a @entity108 director overseeing the service			1
last year , @entity108 began accepting competitors ' phones			1
as a result , the program saw a 100 % increase in trades last year compared with the year before , @entity113 said			0
@entity7 , a newcomer to trade - ins for the shopper who does n't want a monogamous relationship with his cell carrier , @entity7 debuted the @entity126 program in january in all of its @entity74 stores and mobile kiosks			1
it allows customers purchasing electronics to pay up front for the ability to trade them in for store credit later			0
the big - box retailer publicized the program with a high - profile @entity138 commercial featuring @entity140 and @entity141 , in which the celebrities puzzle over " @entity145 " and " @entity147 " phones			2
@entity7 has seen some blowback from critics who characterize the program as yet another " add - on " at checkout , that , like those product warranties , may not end up being a great deal for the consumer			1
last week , the company extended a promotion to offer @entity126 for free on purchases made by sunday			0
after that , the program will cost $ 60 for most electronics people would want to insure			0
@entity7 pays consumers in store credit			2
trading a mint - condition product in the first six months after purchase nets 50 % of the original price			2
unlike the carriers that take only cell phones , @entity7 also covers laptops , tablets and televisions			1
with phones , that 50 % applies to the unsubsidized price , which is much higher than what people pay when they get phones with two - year contracts			2
" consumers do n't realize the real value of these devices , " said @entity179 , a @entity7 marketing executive			2
" they may be buying it for $ 199 right now and getting $ 265 back			0
" but how likely are you to turn around just six months later and buy a new phone ? that 's when the offer starts to look less attractive			0
buy back knocks off 10 % of the value every six or eight months until , after two years , the $ 60 ticket is worthless			2
the @entity126 program was birthed from a long trial in @entity193 stores			2
@entity77 , the @entity68 partner , manages @entity7 's trade - in service at its stores in @entity196			1
@entity8 simplifies resale process @entity7 's offer works only in stores , but customers can check eligibility online			1
the @entity106 and @entity108 buy - back programs also apply online , and dozens of web startups are popping up to offer similar services			1
feeling the pressure , @entity8 stepped in last year with a service called @entity207			1
the auction site partnered with a company called @entity210 to handle the physical trades			0
transactions look a lot like an @entity8 seller listing , except for the annoyances of writing descriptions and uploading photos			2
once your phone is appraised through the listing process , the site lets you print a @entity223 label granting free shipping			0
@entity210 inspects the product , and if it works , the promised money appears in your @entity228 account after a few days			0
creating a service to compete with the spirit of @entity8 , which has always been about letting the average person sell their old stuff online , can seem odd			1
acknowledging shortcomings of the core business , @entity233 , @entity8 's director of seller experience , said that with the old way , " nothing is guaranteed			2
you may not sell it at all if you 're unlucky			0
" you have to pack it , send it , pay for the shipping and everything , " he added			0
" most people do n't have time			0
" since launching a promotion around @entity106 's launch of the @entity27 , @entity8 's @entity207 racked up 1 million trades in a week , @entity233 said			1
which store has the best prices ? unsurprisingly , every trade - in retailer @entity0 talked to said it offers the most competitive prices			1
@entity7 said its up - front fee ensures a good price later			1
@entity108 said it constantly monitors competitors to offer an attractive price that does n't constantly fluctuate			1
@entity68 's @entity77 said it can offer good value because trading is its core business focus			1
@entity8 said most of these third - party resellers end up flipping their goods on @entity8 anyway , so it had the pick of the litter when it landed on @entity210			1
not everyone can be the best , except when it is			0
when one retailer has a better price on a @entity271 , another will best the others on its payout for a @entity275			0
in our tests , the prices were often close , with most offering between $ 110 to $ 140 for a 2 - year - old @entity27 , for example			0
@entity8 asks subjective questions that noticeably affect price estimates			2
@entity0 was n't able to test the evaluation process to see how stringent its hardware tests were			0
but @entity8 pays via @entity228 , which can be deposited into a bank account , whereas most big competitors pay in store credit			1
but the lesson is simple : " never put a phone in a drawer , because they 're losing value every day , " @entity77 's @entity95 said .			0

@entity68 launches a service in its stores for trading in old cell phones , including competitors '
@entity106 and @entity108 have long offered buy - back programs
