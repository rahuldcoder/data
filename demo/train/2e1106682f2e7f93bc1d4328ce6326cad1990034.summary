@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 chief @entity3 said saturday a " deal has been reached " that could be the framework for a binding global climate change treaty			1
" finally we sealed the deal and it is a real deal			2
bringing world leaders to the table paid off , " @entity3 said , according to @entity2 affiliate @entity8			1
" the @entity11 may not be everything that everyone hoped for but this decision of the conference of parties is a beginning , an essential beginning			0
" @entity18 said the non-binding deal called for all countries to limit global temperature rise to below two degrees @entity22			1
he said the deal was a step toward creating a legally binding treaty			1
" the deal is backed by money and the means to deliver it			0
up to $ 30 billion has been pledged for adaptations and mitigation , " @entity3 said			2
critics of the @entity31 have said that without specific commitments from the leaders to actually cut carbon emissions it would be difficult to reach any target			1
environmental group @entity37 released a statement criticizing the deal			0
" do n't believe the hype , there is nothing fair , ambitious or legally binding about this deal , " @entity37 said			2
" the job of world leaders is not done			1
today they shamefully failed to save us all from the effects of catastrophic climate change			1
" @entity50 president @entity49 praised the deal friday before leaving the conference in @entity0 , @entity1			0
" for the first time in history , all major economies have come together to accept their responsibility to take action to confront the threat of climate change , " @entity49 told reporters			1
the president said he met with leaders from @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , and " that 's where we agreed ... to set a mitigation target to limit warming to no more than 2 degrees @entity22			1
" it 's a nonbinding goal , and the emissions targets " will not be by themselves sufficient to get to where we need to get by 2050 , " @entity49 said			0
however , he added that it is a first step , and that for many countries " this is going to be the first time in which even voluntary they offered up mitigation targets			0
" " i think that it was important to essentially get that shift in orientation moving , " @entity49 said			0
the president said he believes it 's necessary that the countries get to a legally binding treaty , but said , " if we just waited for that , we would not make any progress			2
" the deal calls on nations to submit their " concrete commitments " into an appendix attached to the agreement to specifically lay out each country 's intentions for climate change , @entity49 said			1
those commitments will be subjected to an international " consultation and analysis " that will help foster accountability among the nations			0
" it will not be legally binding , but what it will do is allow for each country to show to the world what they 're doing , " @entity49 said , " and there will be a sense on the part of each country that we 're in this together , and we 'll know who is meeting and who is not meeting , the mutual obligations that have been set forth			2
" another senior administration official had said the precise details of the agreement were still in some flux , so it was unclear whether the final version would include language that was in earlier drafts aimed at forcing nations to set legally binding targets for reducing emissions			0
the president worked behind the scenes on getting a vote among key nations -- including @entity62 and @entity61 -- to approve the agreement before taking it to the wider group for a vote , according to the official .			0
