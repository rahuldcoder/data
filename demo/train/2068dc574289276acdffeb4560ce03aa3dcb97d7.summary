-- a fumble on the goal line			0
an interception returned for a touchdown			0
a missed game - winning field goal in the closing seconds			0
most view these as just part of the game of football			0
but could these things actually be the work of @entity13 ? well , according to a new poll , 27 % of @entity14 believe that @entity13 " plays a role in determining which team wins " sporting events			1
that means about 80 million @entity14 believe that @entity13 will help one of the teams in this sunday 's @entity22			1
if @entity13 influences which teams win championships , it 's clear that @entity13 likes certain teams more than others			1
and @entity13 's favorite -- and i know many will hate to hear this -- is clearly the @entity33			1
the @entity33 have won 27 world championships , far and away the most championships of any @entity14 professional sports team			1
other teams high up there on @entity13 's fantasy sports team include the @entity40 with 17 @entity42 championships , the @entity43 with six @entity22 wins and the @entity44 with 11 @entity46 titles			1
and if @entity13 's affection for your team translates into more championships , then @entity13 really hates the @entity51			1
ok , maybe " hate " is too harsh , but there must be a reason the @entity51 have n't won a championship in more than 100 years			0
what did the team do to deserve this much pain ? opinion : i hate , hate @entity22 parties even the @entity51 crosstown rivals , the @entity62 , won a @entity63 in 2005			2
and keep in mind that organization was involved in the infamous " @entity71 " scandal , in which some of its players took bribes in exchange for intentionally losing the @entity70			0
but despite the @entity51 ' horrible history , a special place must be reserved in @entity13 's doghouse for the @entity76 's @entity75			2
not only have n't the @entity75 won a @entity22 in 46 years , they made it to the @entity22 four years in a row , from 1991 - 1994 , and lost every time			2
the most painful loss was in 1991 , when the @entity75 ' kicker missed a game - winning field goal in the closing seconds , resulting in a one - point victory for the @entity87			0
( being a @entity87 fan , i was praying for the kicker to miss , so maybe @entity13 was involved on some level			0
) of course , if @entity13 is helping teams win , how do you explain the success of teams with names like the @entity97 or @entity98 ? the @entity97 have three @entity99 and the @entity98 are consistently a powerhouse in @entity102 men 's basketball , winning their last national championship in 2010			1
perhaps @entity13 has some evil competition in the area of sports ? in any event , let 's turn to sunday 's @entity22			1
are there any signs that might indicate which team @entity13 may support in the match between the @entity113 and the @entity114 ? it 's truly a tough call			1
both teams feature stars who have publicly declared their strong connection with the big guy in the sky			0
the @entity113 ' @entity121 excitedly announced after his team 's victory propelling them to the @entity22 : " @entity13 is so amazing			1
" while the 49ers quarterback @entity124 recently said : " i think @entity13 watches over everybody			1
... he has a plan for everyone			0
" amid ' storybook ' ending , @entity121 is still controversial but public displays of devotion to @entity13 alone have not proven to propel an entire team to victory -- just ask @entity133			2
he 's watching the @entity22 on tv			2
maybe we should look at which team has had more success in the past -- that could be a sign			0
well , the @entity113 have won only one @entity22 , the one played in 2000			0
but the team has consistently made it to the playoffs , year after year			0
and while the 49ers have n't won a @entity22 since 1995 , the organization won five @entity76 championships between 1982 and 1995			2
so , which team will @entity13 be rooting for come sunday ? as someone who believes strongly in @entity13 , i actually hope that @entity13 could care less which team wins			1
i 'd hate to think prayers were n't being answered because @entity13 was watching the @entity22			1
i 'd prefer that @entity13 be focused on helping people truly in need of assistance with bigger challenges than covering the point spread			2
to me , @entity157 's @entity124 had it right with his recent statement : " i do n't think ( @entity13 's ) cheering for one team or another			1
i think he 's helping everybody , just trying to keep everybody safe			2
" @entity13 does , indeed , work in mysterious ways , so we will truly never know if certain teams are favored			0
but if they are , here 's praying that the @entity87 will be back in the @entity169			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			0

study : 27 % of @entity14 believe @entity13 plays a role in which team wins in sports
@entity172 : if @entity13 backs teams for championships , @entity13 likes the @entity33
he says pick for @entity22 a tough call : both teams have @entity13 - loving players
@entity172 : @entity157 *qb* @entity124 said it right : " i think he 's helping everybody "
