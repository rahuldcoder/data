-- @entity1 , the greatest scorer in @entity4 men 's soccer history and one of the players who helped raise the profile of the game in the @entity4 , will retire after the @entity10 season			1
the @entity12 star told reporters in @entity14 on thursday that he does n't have the same passion for the game that he had when he began playing professionally as a teenager			2
he said he made his final decision to leave the game about two weeks ago			0
" it 's bittersweet for me , " he said			0
" there is some sadness			0
i 'm also equally excited for what 's to come			0
as most of you know , i 've been doing this for quite a long time			0
" @entity1 said he wanted to tell the @entity12 his plans so the team could start the process of looking for a new marquee player			2
the 5 - foot - 8 forward has been the highest profile @entity4 player for many years			1
@entity1 , 32 , has netted more goals than any other player in @entity4 men 's national team history ( 57 ) and is the leading all - time scorer ( 138 ) for @entity10			1
the exceptionally fast @entity1 scored one of the most famous goals in @entity4 history , knocking home a stoppage - time shot in the @entity42 to beat @entity43 and get the @entity4 out of group play			1
many expected @entity1 to be named to the 2014 team and make an appearance in his fourth @entity48 , but he was cut by @entity4 coach @entity49 , who praised the player thursday			1
" he consistently raised the bar for himself these last 15 years , and he set a fantastic example for so many other @entity4 players to follow , " @entity49 said			1
" as one of the best players in @entity4 soccer history , @entity1 should be proud of everything he has accomplished			1
" his club coach said he leaves an unbelievable legacy			0
" @entity1 is one of the most significant figures in the history of soccer in the @entity4 , " @entity12 coach and former @entity4 coach @entity60 said thursday			1
" his influence on @entity10 and soccer in this country will continue to be felt for many years to come			0
@entity4 goalie @entity67 tweeted : " it 's been an honor			2
" former @entity4 great @entity70 said : " congratulations @ landondonovan it was great to see you evolve on and off the field over the last 15 years ! " @entity1 has four goals and seven assists this year for the @entity12 , which has 15 matches left in the regular season			1
he also had the game - winning goal for the @entity10 all - stars in a 2 - 1 victory wednesday night against @entity83			2
he also played professionally in @entity84 and @entity85			0
he said he played most of his career in the @entity4 to be near family and to help build @entity10 into a league respected worldwide			2
" @entity1 is to @entity10 what @entity91 was to the @entity93 , @entity90 was to the @entity94 and @entity95 was to the @entity96 : a player whose sporting accomplishments and popularity transformed their respective leagues and set a new standard for how the game would be played , " @entity10 commissioner @entity89 said			1
@entity1 said part of the reason he took a sabbatical last year , including time away during the @entity107 qualifying campaign , was to see how he would feel about life away from soccer			1
he already had contemplated retiring , he said , but came back from his trip abroad rejuvenated and anxious to play on			0
not everyone who helped him with the decision was pro-retirement , he said			0
at 32 , he could still be a good player for a few more seasons			0
and he is walking away from the last two years of his contract , which pays him " a lot of money , " he said			0
he will be remembered most for his moments of brilliance for the @entity119			0
@entity1 left an indelible mark on the @entity4 national team and its history			1
forget all the goals , assists or the hat tricks against @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 ( he actually hung four on @entity128 )			0
there are reasons @entity1 has earned a sort of cult fame among @entity4 soccer 's fan base , and fame among @entity137 's casual fans			1
he 's one of the primary reasons fans of archrival @entity140 shudder when they hear the chant " dos a cero " ( two to zero )			0
the most glorious dos a cero for @entity4 fans came when @entity1 buried the second goal in the 2002 @entity48 round of 16			1
his first game for the @entity4 was against @entity140 in 2000 , when he was just 18			1
he was oh so fast and he could beat defenders one on one			0
if there was a penalty kick for the @entity4 , he would bury it			2
he had a knack for well - placed set pieces , taking most of the @entity4 free kicks for many years			1
" i feel incredibly blessed and lucky to have played a role in the remarkable growth of @entity10 and @entity159 during my playing career , " he wrote thursday			2
" and while my career as a player will soon be over , rest assured i will stay connected on many levels to the beautiful game			2
" @entity1 indicated he wanted to work with youth soccer players , possibly at an academy run by the @entity12			2
@entity0 's @entity168 contributed to this report .			0
