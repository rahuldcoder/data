-- @entity2 boxing sensation @entity1 may be an eight - time world champion but he did n't have the skills to make it as an amateur			1
" he tried his luck , but he was n't good enough as far as we were concerned , " says @entity6 , the former president of the @entity7 and current vice president of the @entity2 @entity9			1
" he was very raw , with punches coming from over the shoulder ; he was floating , in other words			0
" @entity6 knew @entity1 as a teenager before he developed into him one of the best pound - for - pound boxers of all time , and readily concedes that he did see he had great potential as a pro. read more : @entity1 squares up to the tax man but @entity6 -- and sport in the @entity2 in general -- is now left in the strange situation where the most successful @entity2 sportsperson ever has heightened interest in boxing but he could also be a reason for underachievement in the sport and other events at this year 's @entity30			1
the hard - hitting success of @entity1 has led to more @entity2 stepping into the ring , but many of them are seeking the potentially lucrative rewards of a professional career , rather than boxing as an amateur for national pride			1
" the sport of boxing really is economy , " says @entity6			2
" @entity41 to say but the people who go into the sport of boxing are the less fortunate			2
in my experience all boxers that do active and competitive boxing are coming from the lower class hoping for greener pastures in the spot of boxing , as exemplified by @entity1			1
" send in your images from the @entity2 while not as successful as countries like @entity55 , who traditionally have punched above their weight in terms of @entity9 medals , the @entity2 has won five @entity9 boxing medals ( out of a total of nine from all sports ) , with three of those coming from successive games from 1988 to 1996			1
@entity1 was an amateur when " boxing in the @entity2 was at the top of the hill , " says @entity6 , but since the 1990s heyday , medals from any sport , including boxing , have n't materialized			1
funding is the main reason , bemoans @entity6 , plus the increased difficultly in qualifying			0
financial support from private companies and businesses in sponsoring sports associations helps , but ca n't entirely close the gap , says @entity6			0
@entity81 , a 19 - year - old from the island of @entity83 , looks set to be the only @entity2 boxer at this year 's @entity30 , but boxing coach @entity85 sees plenty of potential in his gym			1
@entity85 was an amateur boxer during the @entity2 almost - golden patch -- two bronze medals and one silver -- between @entity92 and @entity93			1
after missing out on a medal himself at the @entity96 he eventually turned his hand to coaching in 1999			0
as one of the amateur boxing association 's coaches , he runs the rule over 48 boxers -- 36 men and 12 women -- who take it in turns to spar and hit the well - stuffed punch bags each day in @entity108 's crumbling @entity109			2
among @entity85 's young tyros are a number of promising female boxers ( this year 's @entity30 will be first that women 's boxing is contested ) , and 16 - year - old @entity114 who became the country 's first @entity115 last year			2
" he 's good , " says the understated @entity85 , who , while hopeful the boxers in his gym will continue to develop in the national set - up , is realistic about why they are boxing			2
" well , they like to be like @entity1 ( @entity1 )			0
even my eight - year - old son , too , " he says			0
@entity6 remains optimistic that @entity81 can win a medal in @entity124 and the likes of @entity114 can develop into world - beaters , believing it takes around six years to make a champion boxer that could give the @entity2 its first gold medal			1
" @entity131 is a barometer for the nation 's development			0
sometimes we feel we are lacking because it 's not a priority for the government			0
but for us sportspeople we do try and find a way to alleviate the plight of our predicament			0
we need fresh blood too , fresh minds , new ideas , " he says			0
" there 's no shortage of raw talent here ... given the right funding , knowledge and technology we will triumph			0

the @entity2 has won nine @entity9 medals , five have come from boxing
success of world champion boxer @entity1 has increased interest in the sport
more young boxers aim to be professional rather than try for @entity9 *glory*
vice president of the @entity2 @entity9 sees lots of potential in young boxers
