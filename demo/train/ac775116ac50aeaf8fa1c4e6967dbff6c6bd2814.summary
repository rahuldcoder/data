@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has awesome power			1
we already knew that she had the power to drive @entity6 crazy			0
they do n't respect her , but they sure do fear her			0
and this week we learned that @entity3 also has the power to make those same liberal democrats forget all the preaching they 've shared with the rest of us over the years about the importance of tolerance and defending those with special needs			1
like , say , a little boy with @entity17 who will be two years old in april but who has already been the butt of a national joke by the brainless and heartless creator and producers of the @entity23 animated comedy , " @entity24			1
" in a recent episode , the character @entity25 is dating a teenage girl with @entity17 , and when he asks her what her parents do , she says , " my dad 's an accountant , and my mom is the former governor of @entity30			2
" get it ? if you do n't get it , you 're trying awfully hard not to get it			0
all week , the @entity3 haters have made feeble attempts to excuse away the offense			1
it 's a teenage girl , not a 2 - year - old boy			2
@entity3 is n't even mentioned			1
how is this scene an attack on anyone , let alone a child with @entity17 ? @entity48 , yada			2
the whole reason the gag was inserted into that scene in the first place is because it was assumed that the audience would know exactly who the dig was aimed it			0
otherwise the joke does n't work			0
when the bit is taken literally , the target is @entity3 's son @entity61			1
but clearly , the intended target was @entity3			1
with the former @entity68 vice presidential candidate , bestselling author , television commentator and high - priced speaker riding high , this was about trying to take her down a peg			0
as someone who is paid to do the same thing with politicians , i 'd normally have a hard time criticizing a jab at a public figure -- even if i like the person , as is the case with @entity3			1
but here , liberal @entity79 made it easy			0
this gag was unfunny , unkind and unnecessary			2
unfunny because i doubt liberals would have found the humor in a bit showing president @entity85 , one of their icons , having a heart attack			1
unkind because at the center of all this is a toddler with @entity17 who , as @entity3 's daughter @entity92 wrote on her mom 's @entity95 page , already has a hard life in store -- filled with intolerance , prejudice and limitations imposed by others			1
@entity103 , head of the @entity105 - based @entity104 , called parts of the gag " hurtful and stereotypical			2
" and unnecessary because there are a million different ways to have written that scene that would n't have been so cruel			0
wan na take @entity3 down a peg ? fine			1
but do n't use her child to do it -- especially this child			0
again , it 's disappointing that none of this seems to bother those on the left who are , it turns out , much more willing to put up with intolerance when it 's aimed at one of their nemeses			0
but liberals are n't the only ones veering off their script			0
after years of telling women , minorities , gays and lesbians , and others to lighten up and not be so overly sensitive to flashes of intolerance and bigotry , now folks on the right are singing a different tune			0
they 're outraged -- and circling the wagons around @entity3			1
but does this mean i can count on their support the next time there 's an insensitive or offensive comment , cartoon , caricature or other item that goes beyond the pale and offends someone they do n't care about ? and what of @entity79 ? how much consistency do we find there ? not much			1
" @entity24 " creator @entity161 told the @entity162 in a statement that he 's " an equal opportunity offender " and that " from its inception , ' @entity24 ' has used biting satire as the foundation of its humor			1
" this is the same show that , during the presidential election , compared @entity3 and running mate @entity172 to @entity173			1
in an episode that aired in october 2008 , some of the characters are transported back in time to @entity177 where they try to blend in by pilfering uniforms of the @entity177 , one of which had a @entity172 / @entity3 button on the lapel			2
this is the same @entity161 who , that same month , spoke at an @entity186 - @entity185 rally at @entity187 in @entity188 , where he took shots at @entity68 and urged students to support the @entity193 ticket			0
equal opportunity offender ? i 've seen the show			0
it 's not that funny			0
but the guy behind it is a riot			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203			2

" @entity24 " show *alluded* to @entity3 's disabled child
@entity203 says the jab was unfunny and hurtful
he says liberals who normally denounce such offensive references are *silent* on this one
