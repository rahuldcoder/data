-- what dare i think about @entity3 ? my mom left the island to escape the poverty , the racism and the sweltering heat			1
she left before @entity10 's ascent and @entity12 politics had hijacked foreign policy			1
she left before both governments stranded thousands of people on a communist island suffering a punishing boycott			1
her departure was not about politics			0
she was black and poor and looking for an opportunity to study			0
she was just 14 when she left her family to live with the @entity23 sisters , an order of black nuns in @entity26			1
she never looked back -- because she just could n't			1
that 's when my family 's disconnect from @entity3 began			1
my mom almost never ever spoke about @entity3 , not about her culture or her distant family , not about the life before she met my dad , another immigrant , and they had the six of us			1
for me , and the thousands of people like me who lost touch with @entity3 , this is what thursday 's news is about			1
a president born 10 months before the boycott -- the 10th president during @entity10 's rule -- has finally given us a chance to see for ourselves what our parents left behind			1
president @entity50 is banking on younger @entity51 like me to be more open to change than the angry exiles from the first wave of immigration			1
he also relies on statistics showing six in 10 @entity12 want the @entity12 to have ties to @entity3			1
the @entity57 has passed , and to some younger people from all walks of life , the issue of @entity3 is old news			1
the anger toward @entity3 no longer makes sense			1
he is letting us get a real look at where @entity3 stands today , hoping the anger toward that nation will subside , even as some @entity70 hope it will not			2
i have interviewed people on both sides of that anger -- at the embargo or at @entity10 , at communism or the limits to any exchange			2
there is a commonality to their pain : their longing to see and relate country - to - country , family to family			0
i once interviewed the @entity90 music stars @entity91 and @entity92 , both @entity3 who support the embargo and raged about the traitors who traveled back			1
yet they wanted so much to go some day			0
they wished me well when i followed the @entity90 rock star @entity96 to @entity97 to cover a massive concert for peace			0
it was on that trip that , as an anchor for @entity0 , i was able to walk through crowds of @entity3 and sway to their music , which has exported their isolated culture around the world			2
i felt the bodies of people pushing and laughing and wondering about me and my life -- @entity3 limited by circumstances but glad to spend three hours getting a rare view of what 's going on outside their island prison			1
they were warm and friendly , and some had the cocoa black skin of my mom , and our family 's curly hair			2
they did n't talk about embargoes or @entity3 in @entity122 or about @entity10			2
they wondered how much rock stars made , whether i 'd traveled anywhere fun , if i wanted a ride , a meal , a cigarette or a chance to spend time on the @entity131 sipping rum			2
it was my birthday and i felt very much at home			2
politics aside , i am so eager to feel that way again			2
on some level , @entity50 's move means i can finally share something tangible with the rest of the @entity141 community			1
they can go back and touch home base , reconnect with the country of their ancestors , with their culture and way of life , taste the food and chat with the people and celebrate and understand their roots			2
i had grown up rootless , disconnected from our family , unable to see firsthand what my mother 's country had become			2
the politics of the embargo alarmed me on both sides , even though i had no dog in that fight			0
the poverty astounded me , the restrictions , how people suffered a universal lack of opportunity			0
yet i longed to remove the mystery surrounding the place and people my mother left behind			1
now , perhaps , i can			0
i did meet my mother 's family briefly during an earlier trip as a journalist , escaping from the pack and the @entity3 minders to sit in their modest white home and hear stories of how they lived			1
i answered so many questions about my life			0
the difference in our circumstances was so vast , and we only had a few hours to broach it			0
i did get to look at their eyes and freckles and cocoa black skin , the curls and the friendliness and the warmth of family ties , to feel familiarity and truly appreciate my @entity197			0
i wished i had been able to grow up around these people			0
i did n't even speak @entity199 anymore , so we could barely communicate			0
this visit was n't enough , yet i was uncertain if i could ever get more			0
i can visit my family , do some reporting and writing , visit a church or take a class			0
i can go to a concert and share a drink			0
i can even take home some rum			0
i know the politics are complicated			0
i have n't forgotten about @entity10 and the many people i 've met here and there who can never forget the past , or the excesses of the present			0
but the question hovering above all this is not just whether reconnecting our two countries was the right thing to do , it was whether it will expand the cultural , political and personal view that the two have of each other			1
i think so -- it has for me .			0

@entity230 's mother left @entity3 at 14 , settled in @entity26 . she never looked back
@entity50 's shift on @entity3 a chance for many , like @entity230 , to see what parents left behind
she says she 's been to @entity3 , people eager for outside news ; she felt connection
@entity230 : @entity242 will open cultural , political , personal perspective she 'd missed
