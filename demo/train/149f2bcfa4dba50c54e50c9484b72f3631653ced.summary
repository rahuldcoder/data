it has been some rather strange three weeks in @entity1			1
since footballer @entity2 dedicated a goal to his friend , the controversial @entity1 comedian @entity4 , by doing the comedian 's infamous trademark salute , the " quenelle , " what some believe is a reverse @entity10 salute , during a match for @entity12 , @entity1 has been talking about little else			1
it is as if the entire public debate has been hijacked by a comedian who , over the last 15 years , has steadily drifted towards more and more extreme behavior and inflammatory speech			2
@entity2 's gesture suddenly shone the light on a phenomenon that had so far been little known outside @entity1			2
now , the world knows that there is more to the " quenelle " than the exquisite dish , a creamy mixture of fish and egg , originated from @entity29 , @entity1 's gastronomic capital			2
@entity4 , 48 , started his career as a comedian in the 1990s , in a duo with @entity37 @entity36 - @entity35 @entity34			0
they separated in 1997 when @entity34 developed a career in cinema			0
@entity4 struggled to exist solo and was said to be bitter about his ex-partner 's success and fame			0
he then entered the realm of @entity1 politics , first of all fighting against the extreme right @entity49 before slowly getting closer to @entity51 's xenophobic party , alongside extremist @entity52			2
his shows started focusing almost exclusively on his hatred of @entity55 and @entity37			0
condemned many times by the @entity1 courts for incitement to hatred , @entity4 publically defended @entity60 's and the @entity62 's anti-semitic rhetoric			2
@entity4 himself , who no longer gives interviews to the mainstream media , denies that his act , or la quenelle , is anti-semitic			0
he claims through his legal team to be nothing more than a comedian and the victim of unjustified attacks because he stands up for those who are excluded from @entity1 society			1
each time that the manager of a theater in @entity1 has refused to let him use their premises for one of his controversial shows , @entity4 has threatened legal action			1
@entity2 's public gesture has had the merit to prompt @entity1 interior minister @entity84 to action and to look into other aspects of the comedian 's personality			1
it was revealed that @entity4 has been quietly investigated for money laundering and tax fraud for more than a year			0
@entity92 , interviewed on @entity1 radio @entity93 1 , stated that @entity4 was trying to declare himself bankrupt in order to avoid paying taxes and fines and that a possible case of money laundering between @entity1 and @entity100 was being closely looked at			1
however , what has divided @entity1 is the interior ministry 's advice to the country 's prefects to ban the comedian from performing if they deemed public order at risk			1
@entity4 , at the beginning of a national tour , thus received his first ban on thursday morning ahead of a planned performance in @entity113			0
his lawyer immediately appealed and an administrative court overturned the ban			0
the interior minister then appealed to @entity1 's highest jurisdiction which decided to uphold the ban on thursday evening			1
a similar legal wrangling is expected to take place in every town where @entity4 is supposed to perform			0
@entity1 president @entity123 weighed in the debate , giving all his support to his interior minister			2
so far , @entity1 's public opinion and the media have been split over the issue of the ban			1
@entity1 may not have a @entity131 , but censorship is not considered lightly			1
there may be an understanding that freedom of speech stops where incitement to hatred begins and the @entity1 , in their majority , think that @entity4 has gone much too far			0
however , is the ban in danger of giving publicity to @entity4 ? his shows are now selling fast			0
others , such as @entity1 philosopher @entity147 , argue that @entity4 ceased long ago to be an artist and that his virulent anti-semitism should n't be seen as artistic license : " this is not humor anymore , this is political , " he said			0
and why should @entity4 be indeed treated differently than @entity51 ? the @entity1 government is walking a fine line between censorship and the respect of republican values ; it looks however as if it has won the first round against racism .			1

the interior ministry adviced to ban a controversial comedian from performing if they deemed public order at risk
