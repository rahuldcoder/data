-- @entity1 hit tv show			1
a wedding ! @entity7 has every reason to smile for our camera			1
a star -- and a trio of gorgeous looks -- is born			1
the @entity14 : " this is my favorite look of the three just because it 's sexy but not overtly so , " @entity7 says			1
" i like simple hair and makeup			1
" there has been a self - tanning mishap as @entity7 crosses the parking lot of the sandwich shop at the @entity24 at @entity25 in @entity26 , she walks stiffly , holding her arms away from her like a paper doll and apologizing profusely for running 10 minutes late			1
earlier , she 'd sprayed her entire body with self - tanner , which refused to dry			1
she resorted to having her fiancé , musician @entity32 , take a blow - dryer to her ( did n't work )			1
so here she is , in a strapless , ankle - length @entity36 sundress ( donned to accommodate the residual stickiness ) , fanning herself and wondering how mottled the tan will be when ( or if ) the lotion ever sets			1
not that one bum experience could turn her off beauty products			1
" i love everything new , " says @entity7 , 28 , who , in addition to being nominated for an @entity45 for best supporting actress on " @entity47 , " just started a production company at @entity49			1
" when i was in @entity51 filming this summer , i went to @entity52 for the first time			1
it was like my holy mecca			2
" she recently had her bathroom vanity renovated with a high counter to make more room for the large drawers below that hold her well - organized loot			2
then there 's her deal with @entity64 to be the face of @entity68 's new women 's fragrance in january			2
considering this fondness for all things beauty -- as well as @entity7 's impressive acting range -- she plays tv dramedy as deftly as cinematic romantic comedy , as in the mega-hit " knocked up " and next year 's @entity76 -- it seems natural for her to be in @entity78 's first ever triple - cover girl			1
these three looks take her from girl - next - door to red - carpet knockout to pixie - coiffed vamp			2
the star , whom pals call @entity85 ( and @entity86 calls the @entity87 ) , popped out her retainer to talk about makeup , breakouts and what boys like			1
@entity7 : i 'm so sorry , i have to take out my @entity94 before i eat			1
in style : who knew you wore them ? i guess that 's the point of @entity94			2
@entity99 : i got them because of this wonky tooth			2
i was like , ok , i ca n't take it			1
it 's awesome because every two weeks you switch to a new retainer			2
pretty much the perfect way to describe @entity94 is @entity107 for your teeth			2
is : right -- the things we do for beauty			2
so , how did you like being transformed into three such different looks ? @entity99 : it was fun			2
i was working with such great hair and makeup people			1
and to have these professionals turning you into someone else is pretty neat			2
is : do you ever go without makeup ? @entity99 : there was a time when i would			1
now that i get followed by photographers , i 'm really paranoid about it			2
i do not want to be the " @entity128 " picture			2
i 'm clearly vain , and i do n't need that			1
plus , i like products			2
is : how often do you go through your drawers and purge ? @entity99 : often , because people send me a lot of stuff now , which is exciting			2
i love getting those boxes			0
[ into the tape recorder : ] send me a box of makeup , @entity141 ! when that happens , i feel like i have to clean out and give stuff to my sister , mom and friends because there comes a point of gluttony that i ca n't accept			1
is : how do you think you express your personality through style ? @entity99 : i 'm a big hair - up person			0
last night at work they put my hair in two @entity158 braids to keep it flat under the scrub cap			0
i thought it looked cute and that i could pull it off after i 'd slept on it			0
and ... no. so i thought i could recreate it myself ... no again			0
as far as clothing style goes , i fluctuate almost as much as i do with beauty products			0
i like to shop for sweaters -- maybe it 's the @entity168 in me			0
i 'm building a house in the mountains in @entity171 , so i tell myself i 'm " preparing " for that			0
i like sweaters -- they 're like scrubs -- you do n't have to suck it in or worry about the bloat			1
is : do you know how you want your hair and makeup at your wedding ? @entity99 : i have an idea , but it 's so dependent on the dress , and i have n't gotten there yet			1
my sister is getting married too , so we looked for dresses together			1
after about five stores i was like , " i 'm done			0
" everyone says , " you just know when you put that dress on			1
" my sister found the right dress just like that			1
so i know it can happen			0
is : wait , so your mom has two daughters getting married within months ? @entity99 : my poor mother is probably like , " why , @entity200 ? why ? " but i hired a planner			1
i want the day to be spectacular , but mostly i want it to be fun			0
and i do n't want to freak out or stress			1
is : does your fiancé have any particular opinions about your look ? @entity99 : @entity32 would n't mind if my hair was brown , if it was still long -- that 's such a boy thing			1
is : would you ever wear a wig out ? @entity99 : i 'd contemplate it , but i do n't know if i actually have the courage to pull it off			1
i once wore a long hair - extension ponytail , and someone asked me if it was real , like i was one of those dolls when we were little , and the hair just cranks out			0
is : how would you describe your skin ? @entity99 : my skin is sensitive , so everything bothers it			0
and i 'm the jerk who keeps switching products and making it worse			0
is : how do you treat a breakout ? @entity99 : i got a great product at @entity231 called @entity232			0
i 've tried so many that were disappointments , but maybe i stand too close to the mirror examining my pores			0
if i backed up , things might look fine			0
is : what do you always carry in your bag ? @entity99 : @entity241 , because i get shiny			0
and lip balm , either the @entity244 's @entity243 or @entity246 's @entity245 in @entity247 from @entity248			0
it 's shiny with a little shimmer and tastes so good			0
is : an in @entity252 reader wants to know how you maintain a healthy body image in @entity86			0
@entity99 : i train with @entity255			0
i love him with my whole soul and follow his 5 - factor diet			0
i first said , " i 'm never going to be -- nor do i want to be -- an uber - athletic girl			0
" it 's just not me and i do n't have that kind of discipline			1
he said , " i just want you to be healthy			0
" a lot of what we focus on is posture			0
i slump into myself when i get stressed			0
if i were going to play an action hero , i 'd have to get that look			0
but i 'd never maintain it			0
for me it 's never about achieving a look that 's impossible			0
