-- @entity1 , better known as @entity1 , remembers when she was bullied in high school			1
she returned from gym class and discovered profanity scrawled across her locker			2
" it sticks with you and it hurts			2
and i went home and cried			2
i did n't want to go to school , " she said			2
her story is n't unique			2
on any given day , 160,000 students opt to stay home because they are afraid of being bullied			0
today , at the @entity13 , @entity1 is officially launching her @entity14 , which will inspire bravery and kindness in young people			1
as one of the best - selling recording artists of all time , @entity1 has repeatedly encouraged her fans to " be someone that nurtures			1
" with her new foundation , she is poised to do much more			1
bullying is pervasive in and out of school			1
each year , 20 % of high school students report being bullied -- physically , emotionally , or socially			0
the results can be tragic , as the recent suicides of @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 have taught us			0
victims seldom report bullying incidents to their parents or their teachers because they are embarrassed , fear retaliation , worry that adults will make things worse , or resigned to the belief that nothing can be done			1
the humiliation of being bullied can haunt people their entire lives			0
as secretary of education @entity49 put it , " @entity25 is insidious , it tends to get enveloped in a code of silence and shame			0
" contrary to conventional views , bullying is not simply a result of troubled kids or peer pressure			1
the stark reality is that bullying has deep roots in adult behaviors and attitudes			1
what would you do if you witnessed three high school students berating another student for being smart , gay , learning disabled , quiet or just different ? research has demonstrated that most of us would do nothing			0
we tend to be bystanders because we believe bullying is just kids being kids or we may not know how to intervene effectively			1
our failure to act has large costs to our communities			0
when adults are bystanders , they inadvertently reinforce the bad behaviors of bullies and the passivity of students			1
however , bullying goes down when students stand up for victims			1
bullying is not a rite of passage -- it is a human rights issue			1
fortunately for kids everywhere , bullying is not an intractable problem			1
there are a number of ways to combat bullying			1
we can start by giving educators important tools			0
teacher education programs typically do not include techniques on how to create a caring and safe environment in the classroom or strategies on how to handle peer conflicts			0
these programs often fail to provide basic knowledge of child development in the curriculum			0
at the same time , educators can utilize proven anti-bullying programs			0
for example , the @entity109 has resulted in a 50 % decrease in bullying behavior in @entity113			1
in addition , educators can play their part by breaking down the high wall that often separates the cultures of adults and students			0
when adults are able to gain the trust and respect of the students , they have more credibility in resolving conflicts			0
strong teacher - student relationships have numerous academic , emotional , social and moral benefits for students			1
students should be enlisted in prevention efforts			0
they tend to be a lot smarter about their social environment than adults , and they are far more likely to adhere to community standards if they are involved in creating and monitoring those standards			0
finally , it is up to the adults in all communities to step up			0
nothing short of a full - blown media campaign is required to change people 's attitudes and behaviors			1
this kind of social movement is not without precedence			2
the best example is the designated driver campaign , which saved at least 50,000 lives in the @entity149 alone			2
imagine a world in which adults and children view bullying to be just as stupid and dangerous as drunk driving , and know how to stop it in its tracks			2
people will need guidelines on how to confront bullies , when to ask a target if he or she is ok , how to enlist the help of others , and when to call 911			0
we can provide adults and children with the skills and confidence to act when they encounter bullying at bus stops , on playgrounds or online			2
we are at a moment of great opportunity			0
in 2010 , the @entity173 hosted the first summit on bullying prevention , and 48 states have now enacted anti-bullying legislation			2
many schools and districts are working to create more caring communities			0
and @entity1 is speaking loud and clear at @entity13			1
let 's not let this moment pass			0
let 's translate this energy into concrete actions that will not only prevent bullying , but also help adults raise children who care about a more just and kind world			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 and @entity192 .			1

@entity1 is officially launching a foundation to inspire kids to be kind and brave
@entity191 and @entity192 : bullying is not an intractable problem
they say that bullying has deep roots in adult behaviors and attitudes that can be changed
while bullying is pervasive , a full - blown media campaign can combat it
