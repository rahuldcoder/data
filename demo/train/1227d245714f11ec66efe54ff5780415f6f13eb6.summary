-- @entity2 's birthday is friday , and she 'll be wearing red to celebrate			1
it 's not her favorite color , but it is for her favorite cause			0
friday is @entity7 , part of the @entity9 's @entity11 movement to raise awareness about women 's heart health			1
@entity15 is a survivor of heart failure			2
@entity15 's life changed in 2000 when she remained hospitalized for fatigue , nausea and other unexplained symptoms after her daughter 's birth			1
" they could n't figure out what was wrong with me , " said @entity15 of @entity24 , @entity25			2
" by the time they figured it out , my heart function had gone to 5 % , and i was on the heart transplant list			0
" @entity15 was diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy , a rare heart disorder that affects women from the final month of pregnancy to five months after childbirth			1
she had never heard of the condition before and had no history of heart disease in her family , or so she thought			1
" once i became sick , we had to dig into our family history to find out was it hereditary , " @entity15 said			2
" i 've had relatives that have died from it			0
" after her diagnosis , volunteers from the @entity9 helped teach @entity15 about her illness and how to manage its symptoms			1
her heart function has improved to around 40 % , and by making lifestyle changes , she is able to lead a mostly normal life			0
during her recovery , @entity15 realized how important it was to educate herself and other women about the risk factors and warning signs of heart disease			1
" we like to take care of the family and everyone else first			0
we have to go to the doctor first			0
the family can not boil water if you 're sick , " she said			0
" the more education we know about these things the better we can react for our families			0
" for 10 years , @entity15 has dedicated her birthday to teaching other women about heart health and raising money for @entity81			1
" every year that i 'm alive i want to remember			0
i want to educate women on the @entity81 campaign and @entity84 ( @entity9 ) because they really did save me , " @entity15 said			1
according to the association , cardiovascular disease claims the lives of 500,000 women each , yet like @entity15 initially , a large percentage of women are unaware of its dangers			1
" i think that women commonly think of heart disease as a man 's disease , which it is not			1
heart disease is the no. 1 killer of women , " said dr. @entity97 , medical director for women 's health and community relations at @entity100 in @entity101 and also a spokeswoman for the @entity9 's @entity104 movement			1
" this grass - roots movement has made a difference , " @entity97 said			0
" research shows that women ( who ) have visited ( the @entity113 ) website , more than a third of them have lost weight ; 40 % have checked their cholesterol ; a third of them have talked to their doctors			0
" @entity113 is trying to raise $ 100,000 by the end of february in honor of @entity121 to fund additional research and education programs on women 's heart health			1
this year @entity15 will don her red and gather with friends , family and other women at a suburban @entity132 restaurant to celebrate her 39th birthday , raise money for the association and teach women to take charge of their health			1
" it can happen to anybody			0
i do n't want women to wait , " @entity15 said			2
" you only get this heart once			0
be forceful about your health			0
" she plans to pass out small red dress pins , a symbol of @entity81 for @entity11 's fight for awareness			2
" for me it symbolizes that there is an importance placed on women 's health			1
it also seems like a sisterhood when i see people with the red pins on , " @entity15 said			2
she said hopes the pins are a reminder that heart disease can be treated and even prevented , but first you have to be informed			2
