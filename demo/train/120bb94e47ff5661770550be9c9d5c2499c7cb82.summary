@entity0 -- @entity3 chairman @entity2 , @entity4 , will unveil a highly anticipated 2012 @entity6 budget next week that proposes dramatic changes to political lightning rods : entitlements			2
the plan , to be released tuesday , calls for a controversial overhaul of @entity12 , the health care program for seniors , and imposes deep cuts in @entity16 , which provides health benefits to low - income @entity18 , according to @entity3 @entity6 sources with knowledge of the proposal			1
starting 10 years from now , in 2021 , @entity18 would no longer enroll in the @entity12 program , but instead receive vouchers for private insurance , according to the @entity6 sources , who stressed anyone 55 or older now would not be affected by the change			1
the plan is modeled after one @entity2 proposed last year with @entity30 , budget director under president @entity31			2
details of how @entity12 voucher program would work are still unclear , but the @entity35 plan said the amount of the voucher -- a lump sum payment from the government -- would be calculated in part by taking the average federal cost per @entity12 enrollee			2
the @entity6 aims to save billions of dollars in revamping @entity12 , a large contributor to the massive federal deficit and debt			2
sources said they did not yet know how much savings @entity2 would project by drastically changing the @entity12 program			2
on @entity16 , @entity2 's plan calls for deep cuts , as much as $ 1 trillion			1
the program would also fundamentally change -- the federal share of the @entity16 system would become block grants to the states			1
@entity1 has been told that the @entity3 @entity6 budget plan does not call for significant change to the @entity58 program			1
@entity6 argue that while @entity58 is a factor in the nation 's fiscal crisis , it does n't contribute as much to the soaring debt as @entity12			1
two @entity3 @entity6 lawmakers briefed on the proposal told @entity1 they and others on the @entity67 believe it 's a mistake not to tackle @entity58			1
as for so - called discretionary spending , one of the sources -- who would not speak on the record before the plan is publicly announced -- said @entity2 's proposal promises to roll back spending to 2006 levels			1
it 's unclear how much that would slash , but it is expected to be far more than the roughly $ 61 billion in spending cuts @entity82 passed in february			1
@entity2 is expected to give specifics on how much savings the plan would create when it is unveiled tuesday			0
a @entity6 source said even with the major cuts and changes in @entity2 's proposal -- essentially a blueprint that guides spending decisions and does not go to the president for his signature -- it would not bring the budget into balance for many years			1
still , @entity6 sources briefed on the plan said it would save hundreds of billions of dollars more than the president 's proposed 2012 budget , and trillions over the next 10 years			0
the budget would also cut the corporate tax rate , but at the same time do away with tax loopholes for corporations			1
@entity2 's plan also provides for a permanent extension of all the @entity107 - era tax cuts , which under a compromise with president @entity109 were extended last year through 2012			2
@entity3 @entity6 leaders have been signaling for some time that they plan dramatic and controversial changes to entitlement programs in order to rein in the budget deficit and debt			0
knowing that the proposed changes will be politically risky and elicit an onslaught of criticism , @entity2 and @entity6 whip @entity116 have been holding sessions two or three times a week with @entity3 @entity6 to try to arm them with information about the gravity of the debt problem and why it needs to be fixed			0
@entity1 was allowed into one of these meetings last month , and heard @entity2 lay out for his @entity6 colleagues in stark terms what he calls the " tidal wave " of debt the country is facing			0
" the @entity134 has this economic model where they measure the economy going forward , and they are telling us that the entire economy crashes in the year 2037 because their computer simulation ca n't conceive of any way in which the @entity18 economy can continue , " @entity2 told the @entity6 group			0
" by the time my kids are my age , just those three programs -- @entity58 , @entity16 and @entity12 -- will consume all federal revenues			1
there will be no room for anything else in the federal budget , " @entity2 said			0
when @entity2 proposed a version of his @entity12 overhaul idea last year , known as his " road map , " @entity150 skewered it and tried to use it as a campaign weapon against republicans across the country			0
@entity109 has often said it is important for @entity0 to address entitlement spending			0
but the president has not offered any specific proposals , and @entity6 suggest he wants them to take the first risky steps			0
multiple @entity6 sources admit the timing of @entity2 's 2012 budget proposal is tricky			2
it will be released in the middle of down - to - the - wire , contentious negotiations with @entity150 about a spending measure to keep the government running for the rest of this 2011 fiscal year			0
@entity1 has been told that @entity6 leaders considered delaying the release of @entity2 's budget until this year 's spending differences are resolved			0
however , they decided to go ahead with it in hopes showing major cuts and reforms planned for next year will calm rank - and - file conservatives who feel the leadership is too compromising on spending cuts .			0

seniors would get vouchers for private insurance
@entity16 would be cut by up to $ 1 trillion
corporate tax rate would be cut , but corporation loopholes would end
proposal would not touch @entity58
