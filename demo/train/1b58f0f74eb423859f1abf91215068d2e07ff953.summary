-- authorities have wrapped up their search at the home that once belonged to @entity5 gangster @entity4 " @entity6 after finding material that " may be human remains " under the floor , a law enforcement source with knowledge of an investigation at the home said thursday			1
investigators at @entity15 in @entity16 finished the search wednesday night for human remains possibly connected to a case that happened before 1996 , said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity			1
it will be a few days before the @entity25 learns from forensic testing by the medical examiner 's office if the remains are human , the source said			1

@entity39 played @entity6 as @entity40 in the 1990 @entity42 classic mafia film " @entity43 , " and @entity6 is likely best known as the alleged mastermind of the 1978 @entity46 heist , an $ 8 million robbery at @entity48 , which was the largest robbery in history at the time			0
