-- the @entity2 sisters continued their march towards more @entity5 success with three victories between them in @entity8 on monday			0
fourth seed @entity2 romped into the third round of the women 's singles with a 6 - 2 6 - 3 win over @entity15 's @entity14 , whose older sister @entity16 she beat to win her fifth @entity18 title earlier this month			1
the @entity19 will next face @entity22 13th seed @entity20 , who knocked out 2010 @entity24 champion @entity23			0
@entity20 , the bronze medalist at @entity25 four years ago , triumphed 6 - 3 6 - 3			0
" it was tough conditions , a little windy			0
i 'm glad i was able to pull through , " said @entity2 , who faces a possible quarterfinal against former world no. 1 @entity30 or @entity32 's @entity31 as she seeks the only major title missing from her collection			1
her older sibling @entity35 , who is in the same half of the draw , bounced back from her early exits at the @entity24 and @entity18 by thrashing @entity24 runnerup @entity39 6 - 3 6 - 1 in her delayed first - round match			1
" another gold medal would be amazing , " said the 32 - year - old , who won the singles title in 2000 along with the doubles , which she and @entity2 won again in 2008			2
" i ca n't even imagine the feeling , i think my head would be too big and no one would even like me anymore			0
i 've got to get there first , i have two chances and i 'll go for it			0
" @entity35 will next play @entity53 's @entity52 , who progressed into the second round by winning 6 - 2 6 - 1 against @entity55 of @entity56			1
if she wins that game , @entity2 will play either @entity60 seventh seed @entity58 or @entity62 's @entity61 for a place in the quarterfinals			2
that could mean a last - eight clash with world no. 1 @entity67 , who survived a second - set scare to beat 79th - ranked @entity71 @entity70 6 - 1 3 - 6 6 - 1 in her opening match on @entity69			1
the @entity73 , who lost to @entity2 in the @entity18 semifinals , will next face @entity76 of @entity77			2
@entity2 and @entity35 also won their opening doubles match , beating @entity71 's @entity80 and @entity81 6 - 3 6 - 2 to set up a clash with @entity58 and @entity83			1
@entity83 also moved into round two of the singles , coming from behind to beat @entity87 teen @entity86 -- ranked 297th -- and securing a match against @entity90 's @entity89			0
the winner of that tie will likely face world no. 3 @entity93 , who next plays @entity96 's @entity95			0
former world no. 1s @entity97 and @entity99 will meet in round three , while @entity103 sixth seed @entity101 -- whose @entity18 defense was ended by @entity2 in the quarterfinals -- will take on @entity107 's @entity106 .			1

@entity2 and @entity109 win their singles and doubles matches at the @entity113 at @entity18
@entity19 could *potentially* meet in the singles semifinals of the grass - court *tournament*
world no. 1 @entity67 wins her opening match and could play @entity35 in the quarterfinals
@entity97 , @entity99 and @entity101 progress into round three of singles *competition*
