@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 and the @entity4 announced wednesday a sweeping final pilot fatigue rule governing how much time off commercial passenger pilots must have between work shifts , ensuring they have a longer opportunity for rest before they enter the cockpit			1
the new rule sets a 10 - hour minimum rest period prior to a flight duty period , a two - hour increase over the old rules			1
the new rule also mandates that a pilot must have an opportunity for eight hours of uninterrupted sleep within the 10 - hour rest period			1
the @entity2 said the proposal was science based , and would significantly increase public safety			0
the final rule will take effect in two years , according to the @entity4 , to allow commercial passenger airline operators time to transition , rearrange schedules and indoctrinate pilots			1
" this is a major safety achievement , " said transportation secretary @entity32			0
" we made a promise to the traveling public that we would do everything possible to make sure pilots are rested when they get in the cockpit			2
this new rule raises the safety bar to prevent fatigue			0
" @entity32 disputed criticism the changes in the rule took a long time			2
" we wanted to make sure we got it right			0
we took time to listen to people			0
every voice was heard , " @entity32 said			0
" you ca n't implement overnight			0
" " every pilot has a personal responsibility to arrive at work fit for duty			1
this new rule gives pilots enough time to get the rest they really need to safely get passengers to their destinations , " said @entity4 acting administrator @entity54			1
it was a point echoed by @entity62 chairman @entity61 , @entity63 , who released a statement saying , " while the final rule provides improvement for aviation safety , pilots must take personal responsibility for coming to work rested and fit for duty			1
the government can not put a chocolate on every one of their pillows and tuck them in at night			0
" the @entity4 said it " expects pilots and airlines to take joint responsibility when considering if a pilot is fit for duty , including fatigue resulting from pre-duty activities such as commuting			1
at the beginning of each flight segment , a pilot is required to affirmatively state his or her fitness for duty			2
if a pilot reports he or she is fatigued and unfit for duty , the airline must remove that pilot from duty immediately			0
" the rule has been a long time in coming			2
in the mid 1990s , the @entity4 tried to update its flight and duty time regulations , but withdrew its rule under opposition from airlines			1
but momentum for change increased following the february 12 , 2009 , crash of @entity94 near @entity102 , @entity103 , which killed 50 people			0
the @entity105 concluded pilot fatigue contributed to the crash , although it said it could not be attributed solely to fatigue			0
the hearing , though , spotlighted the practice among some pilots to commute lengthy distances to their jobs			0
the pilot of @entity94 commuted from @entity115 , @entity116 , and the co-pilot commuted from @entity118 , @entity0 , to their base in @entity121 , @entity122			0
the new rule addresses potential cumulative fatigue by placing weekly and 28 - day limits on the amount of time a pilot may be assigned any type of flight duty , according to the @entity4			1
the rule also places 28 - day and annual limits on actual flight time			1
it also requires that pilots have at least 30 consecutive hours free from duty on a weekly basis , a 25 percent increase over the old rules			2
the @entity4 said the rule also incorporates the latest fatigue science to set different requirements for pilot flight time , duty period and rest based on the time of day pilots begin their first flight , the number of scheduled flight segments and the number of time zones they cross			1
the previous rules included different rest requirements for domestic , international and unscheduled flights			0
those differences were not necessarily consistent across different types of passenger flights , and they did not take into account factors such as start time and time zone crossings			2
another component of the rule includes when a pilot 's day begins			0
the @entity4 said , " the allowable length of a flight duty period depends on when the pilot 's day begins and the number of flight segments he or she is expected to fly , and ranges from 9 - 14 hours for single crew operations			1
the flight duty period begins when a flight crew member is required to report for duty , with the intention of conducting a flight and ends when the aircraft is parked after the last flight			1
it includes the period of time before a flight or between flights that a pilot is working without an intervening rest period			1
" the @entity185 expressed its support for the new rule covering passenger flights			2
" today 's pilot fatigue rule release marks historic progress in what must be an unrelenting commitment to ensuring the highest safety standards throughout the airline industry			0
the @entity185 , @entity195 ( @entity185 ) , is gratified that the @entity2 and the @entity4 have delivered on their pledge , and a @entity199 mandate , to issue new flight - and duty - time regulations and minimum rest requirements for airline pilots , " said capt. @entity197 , president of the @entity185 , an independent aviation safety organization			1
@entity197 said while the new rule brings " much - needed science improvements to flight and duty regulations , " he expressed disappointment that cargo operations " are being held to a lesser standard			2
" @entity1 's @entity210 contributed to this report			0
