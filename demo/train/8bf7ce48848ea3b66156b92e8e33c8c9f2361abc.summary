@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was 9 when she began wearing makeup , staying up until 2 a.m. and having sex with as many as 60 men a day			1
" i used to be really sad and frustrated with what was happening in my life , " she said			0
the daughter of @entity1 peasant farmers , @entity3 -- now 26 -- had been sold to a brothel in @entity12 by a member of her extended family			1
the family member had duped @entity3 's visually impaired mother into believing her daughter would get work at a clothing company in @entity1			1
" the brothel where i was ... there [ were ] many customers coming in every day			0
the owner used to verbally abuse us , and if we did n't comply , [ she ] would start beating us with wires , rods and hot spoons			0
" it was not until @entity3 was 14 that a police officer rescued her and brought her to a safe house compound run by @entity30			1
the 61 - year - old woman and her group , @entity32 , have been fighting for more than 16 years to rescue and rehabilitate thousands of @entity1 's sex trafficking victims			1
" families are tricked all the time , " said @entity30			1
" the trafficking of the girls is done by people who are basically known to the girls , who can lure them from the village by telling them they are getting a nice job			1
it 's a lucrative business			0
" by raiding brothels , patrolling the @entity12 - @entity1 border and providing safe shelter and support services , @entity30 and @entity32 have helped rescue and rehabilitate more than 12,000 @entity1 women and girls since 1993			1
do you know someone who should be a @entity51 ? nominations are open now according to the @entity55 , some 10,000 to 15,000 women and girls from @entity1 are trafficked to @entity12 and then sexually exploited each year			1
@entity30 's own history in an abusive relationship led her to her crusade			1
for most of her young adulthood , she taught primary school @entity61 in @entity1			1
but when her relationship took a violent turn , her life 's " purpose and responsibility completely changed , " she said			1
" every day , there was battering			0
and then i had three miscarriages that i think [ were ] from the beating			0
it was very difficult because i did n't know in those days where to go and report [ it ] , who to ... talk to			0
" after the relationship ended , @entity30 used a portion of her $ 100 monthly salary to start a small retail shop to employ and support displaced victims of sex trafficking and domestic violence			1
by the early 1990s , an increasing demand for help and persistent cases of violence against women compelled @entity30 to do more			1
@entity32 was her brainchild for giving voice , legal defense and rehabilitation to victims of sex trafficking			1
roughly translated , @entity92 means " @entity93			0
" the group has facilities throughout @entity1 and @entity12 , but most of the rehabilitation work takes place at its main campus in @entity0 , @entity1			1
@entity30 said girls from the brothels arrive empty - handed , sick , in many cases pregnant or with small children , and " psychologically broken			1
" " when the girl first comes to @entity32 , we never , never ask them a question			2
we just let them [ be ] for as long as they need			0
we let them play , dance , walk , talk to a friend , " @entity30 said			2
" they are afraid at first , but eventually they will talk to us on their own			0
" the group also takes in rape and domestic violence survivors , as well as abandoned children			0
" i can not say no to anybody , " @entity30 said			2
" everybody comes to @entity32			2
" accommodating its population of close to 400 women and children requires a large staff of teachers , counselors and medical personnel -- and dozens of bunk beds			0
many of the staff are sex trafficking survivors now committed to helping rehabilitate other girls			2
the work is funded by grants and donations from around the world			0
@entity32 provides medical treatment , psychological and legal counseling , formal court filings and criminal prosecution , all for free			2
while some of the girls are able to return to their families , many of them -- particularly those with @entity147 and other sexually transmitted diseases -- become socially stigmatized and are no longer welcome in their home communities			0
for these girls , @entity32 becomes their new , and possibly last , home			1
a hospice on the compound 's grounds houses terminally ill patients			0
" the hardest part for me is to see a girl dying or coming back with different diseases at an [ age ] when she should be out frolicking , " @entity30 said			2
" that 's what fuels me to work harder			0
" the group 's ultimate goal is to help girls become economically independent and reintegrated into society			1
" we try to give them whatever work they want to do , whatever training they want to do , because when you 're economically empowered , people forget everything			0
people even forget [ she is ] @entity147 - positive or was trafficked , " @entity30 said			2
@entity30 and at least 50 trafficking survivors also participate in what she calls social preventive work outside the campus			1
their community awareness camps educate families in rural villages and city slums about the dangers of sex trafficking , and a daily patrol at crossing points along the @entity12 - @entity1 border successfully rescues an average of four @entity1 girls a day			1
" our girls are border guards who have been trafficked themselves			0
they easily recognize a girl that is being trafficked or will be trafficked , " @entity30 said			2
" the girls need no motivation from me			0
they know the horrors of the brothel , and they are here to save their sisters			0
" some girls who are trafficked choose to remain prostitutes for life because their home villages will not accept them			0
but @entity30 says that among those rescued by @entity32 , there is n't a single case when a girl has returned back to the streets			1
@entity3 's recovery is one of the group 's success stories			2
today , she works at @entity32 as a peer educator and also helps with the group 's awareness camps			1
she credits @entity217 and @entity32 for the strength to keep living and the confidence to join the fight against sex trafficking			1
" @entity30 is a hero			2
... she 's courageous , " @entity3 said			0
" she gave me my faith back			0
... if @entity32 was n't there for me , i would be dead by now			2
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity32 website and see how to help			0
