the outlook for dozens of short - finned pilot whales stranded in shallow water off @entity5 's @entity4 " does not look good , " wildlife officials said wednesday			1
" we want to set the expectations low " that the 41 remaining stranded whales can be saved , said @entity6 , a marine mammal scientist with the @entity8			1
the assessment came as the number of dead whales climbed to 10 , including four euthanized by wildlife officials after being found in " poor condition , " @entity6 said			1
wildlife officials are unsure how long the pod of whales has been stranded			1
fishermen spotted the whales , several of which had beached themselves , on tuesday night in a remote area accessible only by boat off the west coast of the @entity4 , park spokeswoman @entity19 said			1
an attempt earlier in the day to herd the whales out of the park 's remote @entity28 failed			1
rescuers have been using five boats to create a blockade of sorts between the whales and the beach as part of the effort to keep them from beaching and simultaneously encouraging them to make their way back to the @entity43 , @entity30 said			2
wildlife officials believe that it took the pilot whales several days to travel the 20 miles from the deep waters where they typically make their home to the shallow beach area where they were found			2
that area is blanketed with sandbars and sand flats			0
" it 's a very difficult situation " given the remote location and the terrain , @entity6 said			2
although there is a slight possibility the whales could swim out during high tide , @entity6 said , " i would n't set out hope for that			2
" " even in high tide , you 're going to have a series of sandbars and sand flats , " she said			0
necropsies were being performed to try to determine why the pod carried out a mass stranding			0
" at this point in time , we do n't know why this particular group is stranding , " @entity6 said			0
in all , 25 people were involved in rescue efforts , including officials from @entity8 , the @entity77 and the @entity78 , @entity6 said			0
mass strandings by pilot whales are not altogether uncommon in @entity5			1
in 2012 , nearly two dozen pilot whales stranded and beached themselves			2
in 2011 , 23 pilot whales stranded and beached themselves			2
such strandings are common and occur in a variety of locations , said @entity88 , director of the whale research program at the @entity90 in @entity91			1
it 's difficult to explain why any particular mass stranding occurs , but they tend to occur in areas where previous strandings have occurred , during low tide -- particularly those around the new and full moons , in areas dotted with sand bars and during storms			1
the animals ' cohesion can doom an entire group			0
" these are very , very social animals , " @entity88 said			1
" they remain together as family units			0
if the lead animal gets in trouble , probably everyone else is going to follow them and be in trouble			0
" would - be rescuers have their hands full , he said , noting that the animals can weigh a ton apiece			0
" it 's a largely , but not entirely , hopeless undertaking , " he said			1
@entity88 noted that on @entity121 in @entity122 , where such strandings are routine events , rescuers have used cranes and a flatbed truck			1
but heavy equipment is not readily available in the remote area off the @entity129 where the most recent stranding occurred			0
no good estimates exist for how many pilot whales exist , but they are not endangered , he said			0
" these events , while they 're tragic , do n't have any implications for the survival of the species			0
" @entity139 rush to save 11 trapped killer whales belugas trapped in icy @entity143 waters at risk of death			0

ten of the whales have died , with four euthanized because of their poor condition
a fishing guide sounded the alarm tuesday after spotting the whales in *distress*
such strandings are common , one whale expert says
" it 's a largely , but not entirely , hopeless undertaking , " says @entity88
