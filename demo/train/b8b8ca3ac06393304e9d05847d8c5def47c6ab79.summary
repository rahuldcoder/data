-- while @entity1 slept -- or at least while the left ate their organic ostrich burgers , drank their jackfruit - guava - flavored vitamin water and tweeted " cleverly " about @entity8 's " @entity7 " -- @entity9 was preparing to counter a growing threat to the nation			1
patriotic members of the @entity9 parliament stood up to political correctness last week by declaring that @entity9 will not tolerate an influx of zombies			1
foreign affairs minister @entity17 even went as far as to boldly state that " @entity9 will never become a safe haven for zombies , ever			1
" of course , the lamestream media did n't cover this story			2
they prefer you worry about things like meteors and cruise ships instead of a growing zombie threat			1
but it 's time for @entity1 to wake up ! @entity9 's zombie preparedness means one thing for us : zombies will be driven out of @entity9 and into the @entity1			1
and once they are here , good luck getting them out of the country			0
' @entity38 ' : five explosive moments sure , some will argue that we can make conditions so tough for zombies that they will self - deport			2
but i 'm not buying it			0
why ? a few reasons			0
@entity48 , zombies have no sense of direction			2
sure , you can point zombies in the direction of @entity9 and hope they keep walking as a pack over the border , but they 're easily distracted			1
second , @entity1 are fatter than @entity9 , which means we are more appealing for zombies to eat than our slimmer northern neighbors			1
third , and most important , @entity1 is the greatest country in the world , so why would a zombie want to live anywhere else ? ! i know some will dismiss me as an alarmist , but i wonder how you will feel when one these zombies steals your job			1
sure , zombie expert @entity67 , author of the books " @entity69 " and " @entity70 , " informed me that zombies ca n't be trained to take our jobs			1
but i have two things to say about @entity67			0
one , he 's part of the liberal @entity77 elite who tries to sell us on the notion that zombies are n't a threat to our nation 's exceptionalism			1
check out the recent @entity77 film " @entity85 , " which is a romantic comedy about a girl falling in love with a zombie			2
sorry , @entity67 and @entity77 : zombies do n't need a hug ; they need a swift kick out of our country			2
what it takes to make a ' @entity38 ' zombie second , just because zombies are n't skilled enough to take our jobs today , what about in the future ? the zombie virus could mutate , and before you know it , some undead person is doing your job for half the pay			2
i , for one , do n't want to tell a red - blooded @entity1 human kid that his dream of being of a dog - walker is over because some zombie learned how to hold a leash			1
plus , keep in mind that if even only a few zombies make it over the border , these " anchor zombies " will create more and more zombies			0
this is a threat to our very existence			0
i 'm not just talking the danger of them eating our brains , which could happen			0
i 'm talking about the greater risk they pose to our federal deficit because they will want handouts from our government			0
it 's just a matter of time until gov. @entity135 of @entity136 or @entity138 minority leader @entity137 says zombies should receive government benefits			0
how long after that do you think it will be until these people argue that zombies should be covered under @entity146 ? ! keep in mind that zombies far outlive humans , so they will be a great drain on @entity151			1
why zombies , robots , clowns freak us out and we all know where this is all ultimately leading			0
two words : zombie amnesty			1
the living dead will then have an easier path to citizenship than the living			1
@entity67 and i did agree that we need the federal government to respond to the dangers posed by an influx of zombies			2
( while i 'm usually against new government programs , i do support any that will benefit me directly			0
) but @entity67 , in typical liberal fashion , advocates a coordinated global response to the zombie threat			1
@entity174 try , @entity67 , but that 's just another ploy by you and your elitist friends to get us to give up control of our nation to the @entity183			0
not on my watch , buddy			0
i see these zombies for what they truly are : un-american			0
they do n't speak @entity190 , they do n't share our values , and they eat human beings			0
plus , they 're probably all liberals			0
after all , you ca n't be pro-life if you eat people			1
i hope my fellow @entity1 wake up before it 's too late			1
we need to secure our borders now before we talk about allowing any zombie reform legislation allowing them to enter or remain in our country			0
if not , then i hope the @entity206 starts teaching us how to speak zombie , because we are all going to need it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			2

@entity9 politicians said @entity9 will not tolerate an influx of zombies
@entity211 : @entity1 needs to wake up and get ready for the growing zombie threat
zombies far outlive humans , so they will be a great drain on @entity151 , he writes
he says we ca n't allow zombie amnesty and give zombies an easier path to citizenship
