-- if @entity3 's camera could talk , it would have some colorful stories to tell			1
from the front line of the @entity9 wars , to the bewitching fashion houses of @entity11 and @entity12 , the @entity6 - born photographer has crossed every continent in search of the perfect picture			1
born in 1962 , @entity3 says his calling was thrust upon him as a teenager , when civil war broke loose on his doorstep and he felt a duty to document it			1
for 15 years he worked for news agencies @entity21 and @entity22 , capturing the spectacle and chaos of combat			0
swapping the battlefield for haute couture , @entity3 's fashion shots have featured on the cover of @entity30 , while his advertising work has earned him three @entity33 awards over the past decade			1
on his latest journey , @entity3 swapped the baking streets of his home in @entity6 for the glacial forests of @entity38 in northern @entity39 , more popularly known as the reindeer haven of @entity41			1
here he would fuse his experience of both documentary and fashion photography to create a series of staged images that tell the story of how climate change is impacting the life and landscape of the @entity51 -- an indigenous people who live across four nations in northern @entity54			1
see more @entity55 he was met in @entity38 by local part - time photographer and full - time reindeer herder @entity58 , himself a member of the @entity51			1
@entity58 's knowledge and experience proved invaluable to @entity3 as he attempted to tackle the rugged and frost - bitten landscape of @entity38			1
here , @entity0 asks @entity3 to look back over his @entity63			2
@entity0 : describe the photographs			0
what was the thought behind their composition ? @entity3 : this series shows members of the indigenous @entity51 people from northern @entity72 , dressed in their beautiful , very flamboyant traditional clothing			1
they are stood in the snow in this incredible landscape of @entity38 , but right behind i placed an image of industry ... a big factory			2
many of the people that are suffering the effects of climate change have not done anything to contribute to it , and areas that are being destroyed are often far away from where the pollution is made			1
the idea with the images is to bring these two realities closer together			2
@entity0 : what drew you to make this journey in the first place ? @entity96 : i believe that the role of the photographer is not only to take nice pictures , but to show people something that changes how they see and understand the world			2
there are lots of pictures out there of ice - caps melting , forests being chopped down and so on			0
they are very direct images			2
but i wanted to tell the story of an indirect process , a story that somehow shows the chain of events from factory pollution on one hand to habitat destruction on the other			2
this journey for me was about creating images that would have an impact -- that would ask the viewer to think about the cause and effect of climate change			1
@entity0 : why @entity38 ? @entity96 : the @entity51 are fighting everyday to preserve their traditions and culture			2
they mainly make their living from fishing and reindeer herding			0
the environment is really crucial for them and they are aiming to live in harmony with it			0
but in the past few years , these people have really experienced climate change			1
their livelihood has been affected because they 've not been able to travel on the frozen lakes			0
why ? because they 're no longer frozen ! they are in crazy situation where they have to transport reindeer by truck because it is not safe for them on the ice			0
i was told that two years ago , a whole herd of reindeer died in the mountains because the ice beneath them just gave way			0
see also : @entity156 master chef gets fresh in @entity157 @entity0 : what were you first feelings encountering the landscape and the people ? @entity96 : it 's interesting because for this project i had done a lot of research -- i felt like i had really immersed myself in the location before i got there , and that i would have a good idea of what to expect			1
but nothing prepares you for the reality -- the sudden impact of the scenery , the extreme cold , the deep beauty of this dreamlike land			0
it goes to show that nature is much deeper than what you can ever see in a photo ... this is something i always have difficulty accepting as a photographer ! as for the people , they were wonderful			2
so warm , smiling -- despite all that is happening			0
they went out of their way to help me			0
@entity0 : you collaborated with local photographer @entity58 , did you work well together ? @entity96 : i could not have done it without him			1
as a fellow photographer , i think he understood my intentions much more , and as a @entity51 himself -- his knowledge and understanding of the people and the area was very important			1
from a technical point of view , his experience of shooting in extreme weather was very useful			0
it 's not something i 've ever done before and he showed me what to do when my camera froze , how to deal with the surroundings from a photographer 's perspective			2
we had a lot of practical difficulties setting up the shoot , transporting the canvas and equipment across a very challenging landscape , and he was there for guidance at each step			0
@entity0 : are you happy with the results ? @entity96 : yes , very much so			0
i think there is a lot going on in these photos			0
you have elements of indigenous culture -- the colorful dress and these remarkable people ; you have the striking , other - worldly landscape ; and finally you have this shocking image that grabs your attention and gives the photograph its important meaning			1
but ultimately , the images are only truly valuable if they have some sort of impact			0
already , i think , just by being on @entity0 , by you talking to me now , i can say that they are having this impact			0
from here i will be traveling to at least 12 other countries using the same idea , the same motif			0
i 'm going to go to every continent to show the real impact that climate change is having ... so this was the start of my journey , and i hope you 'll be there when i reach the end .			1
