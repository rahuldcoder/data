@entity0 -- @entity3 rep. @entity2 , fiscal deal maker ? that 's the latest incarnation of the congressman from @entity7 , who has glided between his role as fiscal wonk to 2012 @entity11 vice presidential candidate to potential 2016 presidential candidate			1
@entity2 was one - half of the bipartisan duo that unveiled a budget deal tuesday evening that would set spending levels for the next two years -- just days before a deadline to settle the matter			1
" this agreement makes sure that we do n't have a government shutdown scenario in january			1
it makes sure we do n't have another government shutdown scenario in october			1
it makes sure that we do n't lurch from crisis to crisis , " @entity2 said			2
budget deal aims to avert another shutdown the compromise deal is significant in large part because agreement was reached -- not an easy feat amid deep partisan divides in @entity36 , where lawmakers have failed to reach a budget accord numerous times since 2011 , including one instance that led to a 16 - day government shutdown in october			1
low profile after being on the losing presidential ticket , @entity2 kept a low profile			2
he even remained largely silent in october while @entity11 and @entity45 battled over a federal shutdown and how to move forward on a government funding bill			1
his reticence was more noticeable because the prominent fiscal matters front and center now highlight his area of expertise			0
he is known in @entity36 as the budget wonk , the expert on the federal government and spending			2
his colleagues look to him for guidance			0
in recent years , he unveiled controversial budget blueprints that dramatically cut spending and altered entitlement programs such as @entity62 and @entity63			0
his budgets , titled " @entity65 , " became the defining documents for @entity11 fiscal policy			2
silence shattered @entity2 slowly started to reinsert himself when his party was flailing during the government shutdown			1
he broke his months - long silence with an opinion piece in @entity73 in october , where he implored both sides to sit down at the negotiating table			0
@entity76 emerges as bipartisan figure after budget deal after the government reopened , @entity2 appeared to take his own advice			1
as head of the @entity82 , he led negotiations with his counterpart in the @entity85 to reach a government spending deal for the remainder of fiscal year 2014			1
while the budget did not address the benefit programs -- @entity62 , @entity91 -- that @entity2 wants to reform , it did avert another government management crisis			1
with the announcement of this deal , @entity2 has reemerged to be a central figure within the @entity11			1
now the more pressing question is : will the @entity11 still follow him ? the dilemma as recently as last year , @entity2 was considered a tried - and - true conservative			2
he was able to bridge the gap between the two dividing components within the @entity11			0
he both won the praise of tea party supporters and had the ears of party leaders			0
that 's because @entity2 is a true conservative			0
twenty years ago , he worked for the conservative organization @entity107 , which later became @entity107			0
since then , the organization has successfully morphed from a group that promoted traditional fiscal conservatism and neoconservative foreign policies into a limited - government @entity113 - aligned group			0
but his support might not be in lockstep			0
@entity107 sent an advisory to @entity11 lawmakers tuesday urging them to vote against @entity2 's deal			1
and many @entity11 members have already panned the deal			2
rep. @entity121 , @entity122 , said he would not vote for it because it " raises spending			0
there 's no way around it			0
" the budget deal in plain @entity130 " i do n't know how a deal is good for conservatives or for @entity3 if the spending is going to go up , " @entity121 said on @entity1 's " @entity131			1
" @entity11 strategist and former @entity137 spokesman @entity136 has said that @entity2 's october op - ed shows that he 's " the adult in the room			2
" " he felt that it was important for him to speak up to address the seemingly never - ending stalemate that we 're witnessing in @entity0 , " @entity136 added			0
2016 ambitions ? while speculation only grew louder that @entity2 would run for the @entity11 presidential nomination , with trips in recent months to @entity148 and @entity149 , the first presidential nominating states , a high - profile role in @entity36 -- especially as a deal maker -- could be both a political risk and benefit			1
it will depend on the mood of the country and the influence of the @entity11 right			0
@entity1 's @entity160 contributed to this report .			0
