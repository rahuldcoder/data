-- the period since september 11 , 2001 , will never be described by any historian as a golden age of @entity5 foreign policy			1
i have just written a history on it , and it 's not pretty			0
since 9/11 , the @entity5 has swung unsettlingly from one set of flawed policies to another			0
first , the unilateralist excess of the first term of the @entity15 administration ; its signature error was the invasion of @entity18			1
then , the reactive swing of @entity20 , toward disengagement and dithering			2
in a tragic irony , a war in @entity18 may someday also be seen as the enduring symbol of his errors			0
some of the nation 's problems come from nearly 15 years of a heightened sense of vulnerability			0
we 're frayed and on edge and have let dysfunctional politics get ahead of national interests			0
but others are tied to human errors that can be fixed			0
the genius of the @entity5 system is that it is built to change			0
@entity20 finds himself at the end of a string of errors of judgment and execution			1
these have contributed to damaged relations or crises ranging from those in @entity49 and @entity18 to @entity50 to @entity51 and @entity52 , from @entity53 to @entity54 to @entity55			0
they include crises at our own borders and strained relations with our allies over @entity63 eavesdropping			0
but @entity20 is not condemned to further errors			1
what he does need to produce constructive change however , is a quality rare and vital in any leader : the ability to recognize when one has made mistakes			1
who to turn to as a model ? the best example may well be @entity15 himself			2
because whatever mistakes @entity15 made in office -- and they were many -- in his second term , @entity15 recognized the urgent need for change and instituted a sweeping reordering of his administration , its policies and priorities			1
he replaced his chief of staff , secretaries of state , defense and @entity88 , as well as his national security adviser , and he modified the role of the powerful vice president			0
he also changed his own engagement on key issues like @entity18 , instituting weekly conference calls with his leaders on the ground			0
and he rewrote key policies , launching the surge in @entity18 , initiating the " light footprint " approach to fighting terror later adopted by @entity20 and responding to the financial crisis			2
in region after region , the results were better , including on social issues like fighting @entity107 in @entity55 , in relations with allies , in results in war zones or in deals like the @entity114 nuclear accord			0
he also actively sought to bring new , outside perspectives into his second term team , a stark contrast to the @entity20 approach			1
cabinet secretaries in @entity15 's second term , such as defense secretary @entity121 ( later @entity20 's defense secretary ) or treasury secretary @entity123 or new military commanders he appointed had not been part of his inner circle			1
@entity15 's willingness to admit errors and embrace change may have stemmed from his own failures and struggles earlier in life : as a congressional candidate , in the oil business , as a baseball team owner and even with alcohol			1
to get ahead , he had to acknowledge his shortcomings and fix them			0
he also turned this ability to see his way through tough times into a plus in another important role he embraced , that of a kind of coach - in - chief			0
@entity20 is seen as aloof from his cabinet			2
all the @entity146 members with whom i spoke told a strikingly different story			2
ambassador @entity150 , who served as deputy national security adviser to @entity15 and then as @entity20 's @entity18 ambassador , tells a story of one top @entity15 economic official having a moment of crisis and doubt in the darkest days of the financial catastrophe			1
@entity150 listened as @entity15 bucked up his aide , restoring his confidence , telling him he was the best person for the job , letting him know he would back him on key decisions			2
this was in stark contrast to the @entity168 - centric @entity20 approach that has left @entity146 officers feeling sidelined			1
it is easy to dismiss such stories when viewed in the context of politics or the very real , and in some cases historically significant , errors of the @entity15 years			1
still , if president @entity20 is to begin to grow in office , he would be wise to look beyond politically inspired caricatures to see what worked for the man who occupied the @entity180 before him			2
@entity20 has his own life experience , of course			2
he will never be like @entity15 , in ways both good and bad			0
but what he may see is that at a moment of comparable foreign policy strains and dysfunctions , @entity15 was not content to give up or to punt to the future or play the blame game			1
he knew that in the @entity5 system , big change is sometimes needed and that it would never happen unless he did what no one else could do : stand up to himself -- the @entity195 -- and demand he admit his mistakes and lead administration - wide change from within .			1

@entity200 : both @entity15 and @entity20 have *overseen* unsettled era of post 9/11 foreign policy
@entity20 has made mistakes of judgment , execution , but in final 2 years he can change , he says
how ? take page from @entity15 . he cleaned @entity146 in term 2 , admitted errors , he says
@entity200 : @entity20 must create change from within his administration
