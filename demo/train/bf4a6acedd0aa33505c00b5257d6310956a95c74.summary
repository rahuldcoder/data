@entity0 -- the @entity2 is establishing a suicide prevention board to examine the mental health of its recruiters around the country after the fourth suicide in three years by @entity8 , @entity10 - based recruiters , according to @entity2 officials			1
the @entity12 is examining recruiters all over the country for job - related and combat - related stress			1
the board will look at how to handle the high - stress climate facing recruiters who may be both under pressure from their job and victims of post-combat deployment stress , according to @entity23 , a spokesman from the @entity25 command			1
" the @entity25 is deeply concerned by the instances of suicide within the @entity29 , " said a statement released by the @entity12			0
" the board 's objective will be to prevent future suicides , increase suicide awareness , analyze trends and highlight additional tools and resources to combat suicide within the @entity12			2
" the @entity2 's examination comes after a sergeant first class , a member of the @entity29 and an @entity42 combat veteran , killed himself at his home earlier this month			1
@entity1 has chosen not to name any of the recruiters			2
the sergeant 's was the second suicide within the ranks of the battalion within weeks , @entity2 officials said			1
in august , a staff sergeant , a combat veteran in the wars in @entity52 and @entity42 , also killed himself			0
another @entity8 recruiter killed himself in 2007 and a yet another in 2005 , @entity2 records show			1
the @entity25 is sending a team -- including a chaplain and a psychologist -- to assist the @entity8 recruiters			0
the team was scheduled to show up in mid-september , but because of the severe hurricane damage the arrival was delayed until october , officials said			0
a chaplain from @entity25 in @entity65 , @entity66 , was sent to be with the battalion shortly after the latest victim 's death , @entity23 said			0
he said recruiters receive annual suicide prevention training , and commanders have additional tools to help their soldiers cope			0
the members of the @entity8 battalion received their last training in december 2007 , according to an @entity2 statement			2
the @entity25 is examining recruiters all over the country for both job - related and combat - related stress problems , but is giving special attention to the @entity8 battalion at the moment , according to @entity23			2
" we do not have any other circumstances with our recruiters around the country like we do with the @entity8 unit , " he said			0
the deaths of the two recruiters this year also caught the eye of @entity96 sen. @entity95 from @entity10			1
@entity95 wrote a letter to army secretary @entity98 this month about the suicide rate in the battalion			0
" due to the recurring deployments that have proven necessary to sustain operations in the @entity104 , it is likely that a large majority of our recruiters are also veterans of the wars in @entity42 and @entity52 , " he wrote			0
" many of our military recruiters work in recruiting offices and facilities remote from the military installations at which their fellow soldiers serve			0
as such , many of them lack the same access to peer support networks and important services for dealing with stress , anxiety , ptsd and other conditions that may directly result from their prior combat service , " he said			0
a veteran 's advocacy group says @entity8 has one of the top recruiting operations in the @entity96 but there is a good deal of stress in bringing in new recruits when the @entity2 is stretched			2
" the suicides in the @entity8 battalion are a very loud , very bright alarm that @entity2 officials and politicians ca n't afford to ignore , " said @entity135 , executive director of @entity136			1
while recruiting among all of the services has been on target for more than a year , the stress levels on recruiters to bring in new service members can be crushing with extended hours and , many times , six - or seven - day work weeks			0
@entity2 officials said @entity95 was correct in saying one of the problems for recruiters is they work in locations often far from bases where they can get the mental health help that is readily available to other troops			1
with the @entity96 at war for the past seven years , the vast majority of recruiters have combat experience , @entity23 said			2
the recruiter suicides come at a time when the total number of suicides in the @entity2 's ranks has been growing , @entity2 officials said			1
through august there had been 93 active duty suicides in the @entity2			1
last year there were 115 active duty suicides , the highest for the @entity2 since the @entity172 , according to @entity2 statistics .			1
