-- @entity1 and @entity2 should be sick of each other by now			1
and if they were n't really friends off screen , they probably would be			2
after filming the surprisingly successful " @entity10 " and reteaming for the june 13 follow - up , " 22 jump street , " the two actors have put in countless hours filming and doing press for their projects , the kind of time that could strain any professional relationship			1
but as @entity1 told @entity0 at the " 22 jump street " premiere on tuesday , these two got " lucky			1
" " it does n't always work out like this , " @entity1 , 34 , said			0
" sometimes you take a movie because you like someone 's work , and then you get to work with them and you do n't actually enjoy working with them			0
and we just got really lucky			0
" in the " @entity10 " movies , the pair play former high school foes who become friends after being partnered as police officers			0
the concept is a spin on the ' 80s tv series of the same name , and , like in the tv show , @entity31 and @entity1 's @entity32 are at first sent to work undercover in a high school			0
the resulting comedy , " @entity10 , " was released in march 2012 to critical praise and box office success , proving that @entity1 could do more than just sub as a heartthrob			1
" @entity10 " was such a hit that it was n't long before a sequel was announced , and by most accounts , " @entity49 " is just as funny as the first			2
what works so well in the film , which sees the pair 's undercover cops head to work on a college campus , is what cements the duo 's bond off - screen : a raunchy , daring sense of humor			1
for example , the " x-rated " bet that they made before the opening of " @entity10 " -- wherein @entity2 promised to " kiss the tip " of a certain part of @entity1 's anatomy through his underwear if they reached $ 35 million that first weekend -- is exactly the kind of off - the - wall camaraderie that comes across on screen			1
" for this kind of movie , " @entity2 observed at the premiere , " the friendship translates into what the movie 's about , which is kind of rad			2
" @entity0 's @entity82 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 says he and @entity2 got " lucky " with their friendship
the two off - screen friends bring their bond to " @entity49 "
the comedy sequel opens on june 13
