@entity1 despite huge advances , @entity4 's military suffers from " serious weaknesses " that could limit its ability " to fight and win future wars , " a congressional study released this week suggests			1
the 184 - page report sponsored by the @entity11 - mandated @entity10 and prepared by the @entity12 , says the @entity13 has made rapid progress in a short time			0
however , weaknesses in its organizational structure -- including corruption among its ranks -- and in its combat capabilities mean it faces serious challenges			2
" these shortcomings could limit its ability to successfully conduct the information - centric , integrated joint operations @entity4 military strategists see as required to fight and win future wars , " the report said			1
shortcomings in its combat capability include logistical weaknesses			1
in particular , the report says that @entity4 lacks the " amphibious lift " -- the ability to transport enough forces and military assets -- for an outright invasion of @entity38			2
@entity4 's navy has not fully mastered anti-submarine warfare , the report said , adding that it is experiencing problems integrating complex modern weaponry with existing equipment			1
the report said it also lacks the necessary trained personnel to operate this weaponry			0
its air force , meanwhile , is grappling with limited numbers of special - mission aircraft and a fleet that comprises multiple generations of planes			0
@entity4 's @entity52 did not immediately respond to a request for comment			1
the 2.3 - million - strong @entity13 is " riddled " with corruption , the report said , because of a major lack of external oversight --- the only civilian in the chain of command is president @entity61			0
@entity63 , a top retired general , recently confessed to taking bribes and it 's widely believed that promotions and positions can be bought			0
and among lower ranks , reports of officers selling military housing and using military plates to avoid speed limits , highway tolls and parking restrictions are widespread			0
the report also said that low pay , and a lack of realistic training exercises -- exercises are seen as failures if the @entity13 loses -- present further challenges , as do the skills of its recruits			0
most are still drawn from rural areas with limited education although there is a push to recruit more college graduates			0
moreover , @entity4 's " one - child " policy , which has created the " little emperor " phenomenon of spoiled children produces recruits who " may not be tough enough to withstand military discipline , " the report added			1
but the @entity13 is well aware of its shortcomings , the report said , with military publications and @entity4 sources suggesting that " there is still a large gap between @entity4 and developed countries ' militaries , especially the @entity105			2
" the report concludes that @entity105 military planners need to understand @entity4 's incomplete military transformation so they can ensure the @entity105 and its allies can deter @entity4 from using force or the threat of force to resolve disputes with its neighbors .			1

despite huge advances , @entity4 's military suffers from " serious weaknesses "
