@entity0 , @entity1 -- nine - year old @entity3 loves fairy tales , especially " @entity5			1
" " it 's got a lot of rats ! " she giggles , burying her face in her hands			1
they 're her favorite part			2
until now , she 's never read a book			1
she would have had to walk two miles to the closest library before			2
now she will wo n't have to make that long trek , because her village in @entity1 built a community library			1
" it 's something that they wanted for so many years , and they just had no idea how to start , " said @entity17 , a @entity18 volunteer and a teacher at the primary school in @entity0 , a village of nearly 200 people			1
@entity17 has taken on the challenge of creating a library with the villagers			1
since starting , he 's been working with few resources			2
many students are roughly three years behind their expected reading level			0
" there 's no such thing as literature or fun reads or junior novels or any of those sorts of things , " @entity17 said			2
" they are growing up in an education system of chalk and talk -- where the teacher writes something on the chalkboard and talks about it			0
they write something on the board ( and ) the students copy it			0
there 's nothing analytical about it			2
there 's no such thing as differentiated learning			2
" @entity17 , 25 , said it made sense when the school 's headmaster approached him with the idea for a communal library			1
" @entity1 is a performance - based culture , which makes it one of the more appropriate places in this region for a library			1
... we are limiting our children 's abilities through ' chalk - and - talk ' methods of teaching			2
that 's why i was comfortable taking on a library project , " @entity17 said			1
with a budget of roughly $ 5,000 , the community agreed to front nearly 30 % of the costs			0
but most villagers , @entity17 said , can barely afford toothpaste			2
" they 're doing it with donated labor and donated space because they ca n't afford several thousand @entity85 dollars , " he said			2
some villagers contributed by cooking for hungry workers , while others shelved donated books or painted			1
with a daughter in the primary school , carpenter @entity90 gave of his time by becoming the construction lead on the project			0
" i was just so happy because it 's an opportunity that ( came ) to her , which never ( came ) to me , " @entity90 said			0
by day , @entity90 , 33 , ventured out to neighboring areas building homes and by night returned to work on the library			1
" that is where i 'm finding this happiness , grateful pleasure for this library because i know my daughter ... my children ( are ) going to learn a lot from it			0
" @entity90 said the @entity111 was the only book he was exposed to while growing up			1
@entity112 and the nonprofit @entity113 donated more than 3,600 books to the library			1
and with three new computers , villagers are anxious to become computer - literate			1
" the ( people of the ) village never had an opportunity to learn about a computer			0
when you are able to read , you 're able to work with a computer			0
if you do n't know how to read , you ca n't start a computer , " @entity90 said			0
in addition to learning about computers , many villagers are discovering new interests			1
ten - year - old @entity130 comes to the library every night			0
he gets lost in the fictional battles of " @entity133 " and " @entity134			0
" he 's encountering words he 's never seen before			0
" it helps me to read better , " he said			0
such opportunities to learn have changed the village of @entity0			0
@entity3 , the 9 - year - old girl , now has books to fuel her imagination			0
if you want to donate books for the people of @entity0 , go to their @entity145 page for information or to @entity112			1
for more ways to help others , go to @entity2 / impact .			0

villagers in @entity1 work together to build a library with donated books , computers
part of a communal dream , some painted , while others shelved donated books
the @entity111 was the only book many villagers had ever seen or touched before the new library
