amid the chaos of flying bullets , roaming checkpoints guarded by gunmen , and the constant threat of a street battle erupting around the corner at any moment , a new underground television channel has become must - see tv for residents of @entity11 , @entity12			1
it does n't look like much			2
@entity14 , with it photographic slideshow of @entity11 in happier times accompanied by @entity12 music , is not what many would expect from a 24 - hour news channel			1
but two rolling news bars at the bottom of the screen have become a vital news source for residents navigating the shifting violence in @entity12 's largest city			1
" @entity14 started at a time when a person in @entity11 might know that someone a couple of blocks away got killed , or a demonstration happened in the next neighborhood , " wrote @entity28 , the assistant manager of @entity14 , in an e-mail to @entity30			1

due to security concerns and because their broadcasts have been jammed by the @entity12 regime at least four times , the channel 's managers do not want their base of operations disclosed			1
the channel 's management says it ca n't broadcast anything more than still images because it ca n't afford the bandwidth			2
to avoid jamming by the @entity12 government , @entity14 's news director said , the network uploads and beams its content through at least two other countries before it is finally sent into @entity12			1
" we have to be sneaky , we have to be undercover , " said " @entity62 , " one of the channel 's news editors			0
for the safety of his family still living in @entity11 , the 23 - year old @entity12 , who worked as a baker until the uprising began more than 20 months ago , asked not to have his named published in full			1

" the regime saw us as a huge target because of the unique approach we took compared to other opposition channels , " @entity28 wrote			0
" the result : everybody watched our channel including regime supporters			0
" in the @entity14 newsroom , 11 editors from @entity11 and its countryside sit in front of computers in shifts , quietly gathering reports from 70 reporters and volunteers living in and around @entity12 's largest city			1
it can be hard to keep lines of communication open to the reporters			0
electricity in @entity11 is intermittent and the @entity104 goes down frequently			0
most of the reporters file over @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			0
there are satellite internet and phone setups , but not everyone on staff in @entity12 has access to secure communications			2

if he says he saw , then we write it			0
but if he says he heard , then we ask other people in that area if they heard , if they did then we write			0
" on particularly grim days in @entity11 , @entity62 's @entity107 account , which is usually full of reporters , contacts and family members , can suddenly go quiet			0
these moments prompt him to scroll through the list trying to find any new developments because " there is always something			0
" the channel is trying something new through double - sourcing and its policy of censoring foul language , a hard task when many in @entity12 refer to the country 's president as a dog and routinely curse his supporters			1
@entity14 is also trying to remain impartial in its coverage of the opposition , according to the channel 's employees			1
but not everyone thinks that @entity14 is maintaining a balanced view			2
with so many opposition groups in @entity12 , the political landscape is full of competing organizations , political parties , and councils , many of which are vying for positions in power after what most @entity12 see as the inevitable fall of @entity163			2
" i am with the opposition but i do n't want to work for the opposition , " said @entity164 , a former news editor at the channel			0
he left after disagreements over broadcast policy			0
@entity164 claimed the channel was turning into a mouthpiece for the @entity171 , one of the larger political opposition groups active in @entity11			0
" we do not work for a group , we work for all @entity12 , " said @entity174 , who replaced @entity164 as the news editor			2
@entity174 insisted @entity14 is apolitical , and funded only by concerned @entity12 businessmen who prefer to remain anonymous			1
those entrepreneurs apparently have plans to expand their media properties			0
@entity174 showed @entity30 journalists a small , makeshift studio his colleagues were in the process of constructing			0
@entity174 said the studio will soon be home to a new @entity189 radio station that also will broadcast to @entity11 , yet another addition to @entity12 's rapidly transforming media landscape .			2

@entity14 broadcasts from a country neighboring @entity12
the content is beamed through other countries to avoid jamming by the @entity12 government
it aims to be impartial about the situation in @entity12 , but some say it fails
