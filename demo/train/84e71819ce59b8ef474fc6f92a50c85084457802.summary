one principal 's inspiration has resulted in more than $ 1 million in donations for what started as an initiative to raise funding for a class trip to @entity8			1
" humans of @entity17 " creator @entity16 launched the campaign to benefit @entity10 , a middle school in @entity11 , @entity12 , known as a " safe zone in a crime - plagued neighborhood			1
" the goal of the trip is to broaden students ' horizons and expand their idea of their potential , @entity16 wrote on the campaign page			1
it took about 45 minutes for an online campaign to raise an initial $ 100,000			1
the campaign evolved from a picture this week on " @entity29 , " the massively popular photo series of everyday people @entity16 meets on the street			1
the fundraising campaign 's rapid success speaks in part to the reach of " @entity29 , " which has a social media following of nearly 12 million on @entity38 alone			1
it 's also a testament to the ability of social media to breathe new life into a feel - good story			2
the inspirational post featured a picture of a @entity10 student named @entity47 in a housing project in @entity11			2
he describes the most influential person in his life , principal @entity52			2
" when we get in trouble , she does n't suspend us			2
she calls us to her office and explains to us how society was built down around us			0
and she tells us that each time somebody fails out of school , a new jail cell gets built			1
and one time she made every student stand up , one at a time , and she told each one of us that we matter			0
" in a posting on the " @entity29 " @entity38 page , @entity62 talked about the discouragement she felt before the campaign			1
" before all of this happened for our school , i felt broken , " she said			2
" and i think the world felt a little broken too , because a lot of bad things have been happening lately , especially between black people and white people			0
but all of you gave people a reason to feel a little less broken			0
" the picture of @entity47 has been widely shared and drew more than 1 million likes on the " @entity29 " @entity38 page , compelling @entity16 to dig deeper			1
" i ask people all the time about the most influential person in their life , and he was the first person who ever told me his principal , " @entity16 wrote in an email			0
" then when i met ms. @entity52 , i could not have been more impressed			0
she is a force of nature			0
when she let me sit in on a staff meeting , i got a front - row seat to the challenges that her school faces , and i wanted to be involved in the solution			2
" they discussed how the " humans of @entity17 " community could help further the school 's vision , @entity16 said in a @entity38 post			2
they decided to create a fund to provide each incoming sixth - grade class a chance to get out of their neighborhood and visit @entity8			1
" this is a neighborhood that does n't necessarily expect much from our children , so at @entity10 we set our expectations very high			0
we do n't call the children ' students , ' we call them ' scholars			0
' our color is purple			0
our scholars wear purple , and so do our staff , " @entity62 told @entity16 , who featured her picture on " @entity29			1
" " because purple is the color of royalty			0
i want my scholars to know that even if they live in a housing project , they are part of a royal lineage going back to great @entity131 kings and queens			0
they belong to a group of individuals who invented astronomy and math. and they belong to a group of individuals who have endured so much history and still overcome			0
when you tell people you 're from @entity11 , their face cringes up			0
but there are children here that need to know that they are expected to succeed			0
" the campaign 's scope has expanded as its pot has grown			2
initially , it was intended to cover lodging and transportation costs for three @entity10 classes to make the trip to the @entity157 , @entity158 , campus			1
in an update friday , @entity16 said that funds raised beyond the initial goal would go toward summer programming for the school			1
" learning stops during the summer for my scholars			2
we have what is called a ' summer slide , ' " @entity62 says on the fund - raising campaign page			1
" they need a safe place where they can do activities and continue to grow their minds			0
" on monday , @entity16 posted that because of the campaign 's success , " we are starting a scholarship fund available to the graduates of @entity10			1
a committee of @entity10 educators and administrators will choose the recipients each year			0
" the scholarship fund will be named for @entity47 , the student who started it all , who will be the fund 's first recipient , @entity16 announced .			1
