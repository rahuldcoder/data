-- for as long as i 've been alive , my parents have hosted the first night 's @entity3			1
as our family matured and expanded , and as the seder became more inclusive ( coming to accommodate first and second cousins , teachers from our school , family friends and near - strangers who happened to be passing through town ) , we moved the proceedings from our dining room to the basement			2
previously on @entity16 : the @entity17 one table became many pushed awkwardly together : the plastic folding table , the pingpong and bumper - pool tables , four card tables ... all covered in matching , if wine - stained , tablecloths			0
@entity0 : how to connect to the present moment at each setting was a @entity28 that my father had cobbled together the week before by xeroxing favorite passages from other @entity32 and , more recently , by printing online sources			1
because on this night copyright does n't apply ... i 'm not an observant jew and would n't be considered religious by most definitions ( including my own )			1
but this oldest of rituals , which conveys the oldest of stories , could n't possibly feel more contemporary or important to me -- especially now that i 'm a father			1
@entity0 : your father , yourself : 6 women look back on their dads @entity45 snuck up on me as a parent			1
throughout my childhood , i spent sunday mornings and wednesday afternoons promising my future children that they would never waste their sunday mornings and wednesday afternoons at hebrew school			0
and yet when the time comes -- my wife and i are still a few years away -- it 's hard to imagine doing anything terribly unlike what our parents did			1
or their parents ' parents ' parents ' parents ... traditions of all kinds compel our parenting choices			0
( this is true for everything from the " cinnamon oatmeal " i cook my children for breakfast to the stories i read to them at bedtime			0
) but so does the desire to get it slightly more right : to put lessons learned in my own life to use , or simply to shape traditions to fit the contemporary moment			0
( we are raising our children vegetarian and often invent our own stories to tell them in bed			0
) it 's a balancing act : how do you bind yourself to the old , without binding yourself ? @entity0 : what @entity85 knows for sure about growing up and there 's something else going on , too -- something beyond tradition , and inherited values , even beyond reason			2
children evoke what @entity93 called " radical amazement			2
" if you 've ever stood at the edge of the ocean before a storm or watched a solar eclipse in a puddle , you know what this is -- when the question being begged is not how something works , but why			0
and at this stage in my life , there is no more radically amazing why than the faces of my sons			0
@entity0 : 12 ways to entertain kids ( without resorting to a dvd ) all those years ago , we were doing more in my parents ' basement than just fulfilling a ritual , or telling a story , or transmitting values : we were setting aside some time from the bustle of our daily existence to engage with a question that has no answer , but whose asking reminds us of the scales and stakes of our lives : " why are we who we are ? " the question inspires amazement			1
religion -- even for the unreligious -- can be a powerful way , perhaps even the most powerful way , to engage with our amazement			1
i do n't especially care whether or not my children believe in @entity138 , but i can think of nothing more important or powerful to instill in them than the experience of wonder			1
and for us , this happens at a pushed - together table with a wine - stained tablecloth			0

" i would n't be considered religious by most definitions , " says @entity158
@entity158 says @entity28 could n't feel more important to him now that he 's a father
even for the unreligious , religion can be a powerful way to engage amazement
