-- @entity2 's vice president has warned that the country could block the @entity4 if sanctions are imposed on its exports of crude oil			1
what does the threat mean and what is likely to happen next ? what is the @entity4 used for ? it is one of the most important strategic chokepoints in the world , a narrow ( 34 miles wide ) strip of water through which more than 15 million barrels of oil a day passed ( through the @entity4 ) in 2009 , according to the @entity20 @entity19			1
that 's about a third of all oil shipped by sea worldwide			1
shutting off the @entity4 would be disastrous for the world economy , causing oil prices to skyrocket			2
have there been previous incidents of heightened tension ? @entity2 has threatened several times previously to close the @entity4 but it has never carried through with it			1
doing that would be shooting itself in the foot as almost 80 % of its revenues come from the oil industry			0
@entity2 is the world 's fourth - largest oil producer			2
much of the oil that is shipped through the @entity4 goes to @entity39 , a crucial customer for @entity2			1
why @entity4 matters @entity2 attacked ships in the @entity42 during the 1980s in an attempt to cut off @entity45 's oil exports when those two countries were at war			1
the impact on prices was minimal however after foreign navies began escorting oil tankers through the @entity4			2
is the latest escalation serious ? or is it saber - rattling ? is it related to the dispute between the @entity56 and @entity2 over the nuclear issue ? the latest threat to close the @entity4 , according to experts and @entity20 administration officials , appears to be an attempt by @entity2 to intimidate the @entity20 , and specifically president @entity62 , not to proceed with tough new sanctions that could target @entity2 's oil industry and its oil exports as well as companies that do business with @entity2 's @entity68			1
those sanctions are aimed at forcing @entity2 to curtail its nuclear program , over which @entity2 and the @entity56 have been sparring for many years			2
@entity2 says its uranium enriching activities are for peaceful purposes , but many @entity74 governments suspect they are intended to produce a weapon			0
how could @entity2 disrupt shipping if it wanted to ? does it have the naval capability or would it use other means ? @entity79 at the @entity80 , formerly an @entity2 expert at the @entity82 , tells @entity0 " ( @entity2 ) could try to close the @entity4			2
what that would mean , though , is physically closing the strait militarily			0
that would be their only option			0
so it means laying mines and physically attacking ships coming through the @entity4			0
i think any @entity20 president would be forced to respond to that and to open the @entity4 ; that would also mean military action against @entity2 so an @entity2 attempt to close the straits could mean war			1
" how would the international community react if they did carry out the threat ? the international community will not allow the @entity4 to be closed			0
many experts say @entity2 would only have limited success in blocking the @entity4 for an extended period of time as many governments maintain a naval presence in the region , notably the @entity20			1
dangerous mix : @entity2 oil and @entity20 sanctions a senior @entity20 administration official , speaking on background because of the sensitivity of the issue , told @entity0 : " we 've been committed to @entity42 security for decades and it should come as no surprise to anyone that we 'll do what we must to ensure the @entity4 remains open			1
" what effect is the tension having on oil supply and price ? prices initially spiked , then dropped back			0
but the prospect of conflict continues to make markets nervous			0
" we are in a situation where there is essentially no communication between the @entity2 government and the @entity20 government , " @entity130 , president of the @entity131 , told @entity0 monday after reports said @entity2 military forces confronted a @entity74 helicopter near the @entity4			1
" it is very worrisome			0
" investment bank @entity141 predicts a $ 40 rise in oil prices if the country 's 2.2 million barrels day of crude are shut off completely			0
what is likely to happen next ? the most likely outcome is more saber - rattling			0
but experts say there is a danger of miscalculation by @entity2 , which has been increasingly provocative and unpredictable			0
witness the alleged plot to assassinate the @entity155 ambassador in the @entity20 , a claim that @entity2 denies .			2

@entity2 warns it could block @entity4 if sanctions are imposed on crude oil exports
@entity161 is important strategic chokepoints ; third of all oil shipped worldwide passes through
@entity2 has threatened several times to close the @entity4 but it has never carried through with it
@entity20 says " we 'll do what we must " to keep @entity161 open ; prospect of conflict *unnerves* markets
