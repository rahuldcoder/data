-- @entity2 's computer systems will soon be able to recognize familiar faces			1
@entity2 is making changes to the process for tagging friends in photos uploaded to the social network , the company announced on tuesday			1
starting in a few weeks , the system will scan all images posted to @entity2 and suggest the names of people who appear in the frame			1
last year , @entity2 began rolling the facial - recognition feature out to a test group			1
@entity2 's more than 500 million users have been automatically included in the database , but the company is allowing each person to choose whether to be identified by toggling a pane in the account 's privacy settings			1
the option is called " suggest photos of me to friends " within the " customize settings " page			2
the tool would still scan that person 's face and figure out who it is , but it wo n't display that information			0
people can still manually tag friends			0
the news sparked a small brushfire of media hostility			0
bloggers characterized the tool -- and @entity2 's decision not to ask before including everyone -- as unsettling while others urged readers to opt out			1
@entity2 said on wednesday it had made mistakes with the release			2
" we should have been more clear with people during the roll - out process when this became available to them , " a spokeswoman said			0
" tag suggestions are now available in most countries , and we 'll post further updates to our blog over time			1
" @entity61 recently decided not to release an application that would let someone snap a picture of a person 's face using a smartphone in order to find out who the subject is , @entity58 , the search giant 's executive chairman and former ceo , said at a conference last week			0
@entity58 believed it to be the first time @entity61 engineers had completed a project and decided to shutter it for privacy reasons , he said			0
the work on @entity61 's facial - recognition technology has not gone to waste			1
it 's used to preserve privacy by blurring faces in @entity61 's @entity85 mapping project , @entity86 , the engineering director for image recognition , said in a recent interview			1
when asked whether he would be frustrated if @entity2 beat his team to releasing a face - recognition product , @entity86 said : " let them get burned first			1
there would be some backlash			0
" photo - management software such as @entity61 's @entity95 and @entity97 's @entity96 provide a similar feature			1
they pore over a person 's snapshots in an attempt to group each person together by facial features			2
@entity61 has not enabled this feature on the online version of its photo software , called @entity109			0
limited to a small sampling of the few hundred photos on a person 's computer , these systems are n't very accurate			0
with the largest photo - sharing service in @entity2 scanning millions of pictures daily , these algorithms are no doubt learning quickly			1
more than 100 million photos per day are uploaded to @entity2 , according to a company statement			2
the face - scanning feature actually runs counter to @entity2 ceo @entity123 's comments to reporters in november			1
" before people - tagging came out , i think most people would have said that the best way to figure out who 's in photos was to have some face - recognition algorithm , " he said			1
" but it actually turns out that the best way is to just have people tagged			0
" some experts agree with @entity123 's apparently outdated statements			0
" face technology will never work in gigantic - large databases , " said @entity137 ceo @entity136 , who has worked with @entity86 in the past			0
however , " if you limit the database -- say , i 'm trying to recognize someone in the 400 contacts that i have on @entity2 , " then face scanning could be effective , he said			2
@entity2 users who have installed an app called @entity148 can already have faces in their photos scanned and identified			2
the 3 - year - old app has looked at more than 23 billion images , said @entity153 , the ceo of @entity154 , which develops the service			0
with @entity2 poised to offer essentially the same functionality , @entity154 will instead focus on partnerships with developers , @entity153 wrote in an e-mailed statement tuesday night			2
" as long as their products provide value to consumers while protecting their privacy , we will always be supportive of companies using this technology , " he said .			0

new : @entity2 *apologizes* , says tag suggestions are available now " in most countries "
@entity2 will start scanning and identifying all pictures uploaded in the next few weeks
users can now opt out by clicking a few buttons on their privacy settings pages
it 's *unclear* how well @entity2 's facial - recognition software works
