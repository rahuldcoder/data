( @entity4 ) -- work ca n't get much worse than when it stinks -- literally			1
for @entity11 , work stinks everyday			1
" i work near an executive ( woman ) that does work out at lunchtime , " @entity11 says			2
" she returns smelling like body odor and @entity17			2
it does n't cut it			1
" rather than let his co-worker continue smelling up the office , @entity11 , author of " on the job : how to make it in the @entity28 , " took the high road and told his colleague she had a small problem			2
he says the sheer embarrassment motivated her to not only shower , but not to take it personally or hold a grudge			2
" never be afraid to confront annoying co-workers head on , " @entity11 says			2
" remember they are peers , not the boss			1
" there 's ( at least ) one annoying co-worker in every office			2
whether it 's the chatty - @entity41 , smelly - @entity42 , tag - along - @entity43 , or just " that guy , " difficult co-workers ( unfortunately ) are the standard in the workplace -- not the exception			1
most difficult co-workers are oblivious to their nightmare behavior			2
avoiding them is out of the question			2
if you do make a comment , they stare at you like you 're from the moon			0
your feelings have been building up for months -- maybe even years -- and it 's time to do something about it			0
you can either pull your hair out over their obnoxious behaviors -- or , you can deal with them accordingly			0
define the problem ( aka " co-worker " ) in " @entity67 survival handbook : work " ( @entity68 ) , @entity69 and @entity70 describe four possible types of co-workers			0
the talker ... just wo n't shut up ; engages in long - winded , one - sided conversations on relatively trivial subjects ; and always has something to say about something ( or someone )			1
the kiss - up ... craves approval mostly from the boss , but will also seek approval from you			1
the @entity84 ( @entity85 ) ... has no boundaries and no shame			1
he / she will share every piece of unpleasant and personal information with you , without sparing a detail			0
the @entity94 ... much like the @entity84 , will share any and every story -- as long as it 's not theirs			1
@entity97 , a workplace etiquette expert with @entity99 - based executive search firm @entity98 , offers these tips if a co-worker is annoying you : tip no. 1 : take a break			1
when you are spending more than 40 hours per week indoors with the same people , something is bound to bother you , @entity105 says			0
" everyone is going to have some sort of mannerism that bothers you , whether they crack their gum too loud or just hold their pen wrong			0
step outside for a breath of fresh air or run out to get a cup of coffee , she suggests			0
" it 's human nature to get bothered by the little things , so just accept it and take a break ! " tip no. 2 : be mentally tough			0
do n't let another colleague 's bad habits hurt your concentration and productivity at work			1
@entity105 suggests ignoring him or her as best you can and limiting your daily interactions with them			0
" if career advancement is important to you , then always try to act professionally in the workplace regardless of what an annoying co-worker might do , " @entity105 offers			0
tip no. 3 : discuss the problem with your co-worker			0
( ... in a non-judgmental , non-confrontational way of course ... ) @entity105 agrees with @entity11 that you should n't be afraid to say something to your co-worker			1
depending on what the behavior is that 's bothering you , it never hurts to approach your co-worker for a friendly little chat , @entity105 says			0
" co-workers sometimes do n't notice they are doing something really annoying because it 's just by habit , " @entity105 contends			1
" by saying , ' i do n't know if you noticed but ... ( insert issue here ) ' -- a reasonable co-worker will usually be receptive to your feelings			1
" tip no. 4 : talk with your supervisor			0
if the friendly and polite one - on - one does n't work ( or turn out to be so friendly ) , another option is to bring up the issue with your supervisor			1
" from a managerial perspective , a difficult employee who is insensitive to other co-workers can poison a workplace environment and severely impact inner - office morale , " @entity105 says			1
" effective supervisors know how imperative it is to nip problems like this in the bud as soon as they arise			0
