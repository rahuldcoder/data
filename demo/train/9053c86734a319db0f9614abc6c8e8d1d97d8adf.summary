-- blood found on the scene of a @entity5 kidnapping belonged to the victim , police said thursday			1
@entity7 , 25 , was abducted late last month from an @entity9 station in @entity10 , where she was working alone , sometime around 11 p.m. , police have said			1
investigators found " suspicious substances " at the station and turned them in to the state 's crime lab , which identified some of it as blood			1
a dna analysis matched it to @entity7 , the @entity18 said			1
the amount of blood found was small , police said			1
authorities notified the family of the findings			0
suspect 's face police have put a face with the description of a man suspected of kidnapping the gas station cashier			1
he is a white male , about 6 feet tall , between 30 and 40 years old , with wavy hair parted in the middle			1
on tuesday evening , police released a sketch of the suspect			2
police also are looking for a silver minivan -- possibly a @entity39 -- that was seen at the gas station			1
" we have one witness who placed that vehicle there and saw the driver			0
that 's what we based that description on so far , " @entity10 police chief @entity45 told @entity0 affiliate @entity46			2
video from a nearby business showed the suspected minivan in the area around the time @entity7 went missing			1
the video is blurry , the van is only seen for a few seconds , and neither a driver nor license plate can be seen			0
" i wish i had the technology like you see on tv where you could blow it up and i could see the driver inside			0
but that does n't exist for me , " @entity45 told @entity46			0
" it does give us some hope that we 've got some accurate information out there to work with , " he told the station			2
how she disappeared @entity7 was scheduled to close the @entity9 station where she was working alone at 11:30 p.m. on april 26			1
but at 11:15 , police got a 911 call that the station was unmanned			2
" it 's very suspicious why there 's nobody here , " the 911 caller says in a tape			0
the way the station was left , police say , led them to believe somebody abducted @entity7			1
" her purse and other belongings were undisturbed			0
in addition , the store 's cash drawer was found out , and no money was missing , " police said in a statement			2
@entity7 is described as 5 feet 1 inches tall , weighing 110 pounds , with blond hair , blue eyes and wearing wire - rimmed glasses			1
@entity7 's mother , @entity96 , has said that she suspects someone familiar with the gas station and possibly known to @entity7 took her daughter			1
" i think whoever did this had been in the gas station before and maybe @entity103 knew him , " @entity96 said			2
" he probably lured her out by saying he needed help , " she said			0
" @entity103 would have helped anybody			0
and that was probably her downfall			0
" lack of surveillance images the station did not have security cameras , something that police said has hindered the investigation and that @entity96 said always troubled her			2
" when i knew she was working there , when i knew ( the store ) had no security cameras , when she was going to be by herself , i expressed my concern about it all the time to her how worried i was , " the mother said			0
but those concerns apparently did n't trouble @entity7			2
" she just thought she could handle everything , " @entity96 said			0
the mother also thanked the community of 22,500 on the shores of @entity128 for its support in the search for her daughter			0
" so many people have been trying to help us find @entity103			0
it 's just been wonderful , " she said			0
