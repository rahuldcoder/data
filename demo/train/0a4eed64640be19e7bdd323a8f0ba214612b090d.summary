-- after weeks of fruitless searching for the missing @entity4 plane , it sounds like a promising sign			2
when a @entity7 patrol ship picked up two pulses in the southern @entity9 , the head of the @entity12 agency coordinating search efforts called it " an important and encouraging lead			1
" investigators hope the audio signals are locator beacons from the plane 's data recorders , but they 're not sure yet			1
is it the discovery we 've all been waiting for ? could those be @entity25 's pingers ? here are four reasons to believe and six reasons to doubt : reasons to believe 1 ) the frequency does n't occur in nature			1
the @entity37 01 patrol ship detected pulses at a frequency of @entity40 , the @entity7 state - run @entity34 news agency reported			1
that 's the same frequency of black box pingers -- and that frequency is no accident			1
the pingers were designed to have that frequency because it does not occur in nature			1
2 ) there were two separate events			2
the @entity51 reported two pulses within 2 kilometers ( 1.25 miles ) of each other			1
air chief marshal @entity54 , head of the @entity55 , described them as " fleeting , fleeting acoustic events			2
" one was described as being 90 seconds long ; no time was given for the other , but it was evidently shorter			2
" i think the fact that we have had two detections , two acoustic events , in that location provides some promise which requires a full investigation of the location , " @entity54 said			1
3 ) you usually know a ping when you hear one			0
the pings are , under ideal conditions , easily recognizable			0
they " ping " like a metronome â € ” with a steady pulse about once a second			0
4 ) they 're in the right spot			0
according to the latest analysis of @entity82 satellite data and aircraft performance , the @entity51 is in the right spot			1
in fact , search supervisors , citing the new analysis , are moving the focus of the search to an area that includes the location of the @entity91 01			1
" the area of highest probability , we think is now probably in the southern part of the area , pretty close to where @entity91 01 is operating , " @entity54 said			0
pulse signals raise new questions reasons to doubt 1 ) the ocean is noisy			1
in addition to the @entity91 01 's two " acoustic events , " ships detected two other events in a very short time , showing exactly how noisy the ocean is			1
the @entity109 ship @entity110 recorded one event that was determined to be unfounded			1
the @entity112 , an @entity12 naval vessel equipped with sophisticated listening equipment , has also detected " an acoustic noise " in another area of the ocean to the north			1
according to a @entity0 calculation , the @entity12 ship was about 350 miles ( 565 kilometers ) away from the spot where the @entity7 ship detected the pulses			1
it 's also unclear whether the sound the @entity12 ship detected was related to flight 370			1
the search team is urging patience and restraint			0
2 ) only one pulse was detected at a time			1
the @entity51 detected only one pulse at a time			2
assuming both black box pingers are working , are close together , and are unobstructed by debris or terrain â € ” and those are , admittedly , big assumptions â € ” they should have heard two pingers , perhaps like a metronome with an echo			2
3 ) these are n't ideal conditions			0
while pingers are easily identifiable under ideal conditions , the current conditions are far from perfect			2
video of the searchers show them listening to the hydrophone with earbuds , not headsets that would block out ambient noise			0
so the steady " pings " -- which actually sound like the snap of fingers -- could be confused with or overwhelmed by other noise , such as the waves lapping against the boat			0
the @entity7 said they did not have time to record the pulses , precluding a scientific analysis of the sounds			1
4 ) a spare pinger on the boat might have sent the signal			0
in video of the @entity91 01 , it appears the @entity7 had a spare pinger in the boat			1
@entity166 , president of pinger manufacturer @entity167 , says it is not recommended to have a pinger near the area where you are trying to listen			0
if that pinger gets wet , it will start transmitting , potentially confusing search teams			0
" i would n't put one where i 'm measuring , " @entity166 said			0
" it 's just not good common practice			2
" 5 ) the equipment was designed for shallow water			0
the hydrophone the @entity7 used to detect the pulse is " designed for shallow water applications , " not for the deep water , said @entity183 of @entity184 , manufacturer of the hydrophone			1
" they are using it in a scenario outside of our normal operation , " he said			0
is it possible that it heard a ping from the depths of the @entity9 ? " it is possible , but it would be right at the edge of that detection ( capability ) , " he said			0
6 ) the underwater search of a vast area started only recently			0
the search area is so large , and the underwater search has just begun			0
it almost defies belief that the pingers could be found so soon			2
but then again , almost everything about this case defies belief			0
the bottom line we 'll give the final word to @entity54			0
" this is an important encouraging lead , but one which i urge you to continue to treat carefully , " he told reporters			2
" we are working in a very big ocean and within a very large search area , and so far , since the aircraft went missing , we have had very few leads which allow us to narrow the search area			0
" @entity0 's @entity226 and @entity227 contributed to this report .			2

are the pulses detected by a @entity7 patrol ship @entity25 's pingers ?
the frequency and location are *indications* they might be
there are also a number of reasons to doubt the latest lead
