@entity0 , @entity1 -- eight years ago @entity3 was told by doctors to say a final goodbye to her family -- she had , they said , only hours left to live before her lungs would stop working and her body shut down			1
but this july @entity3 defied her medical fate and made history by becoming the first double lung transplant survivor ever to have raced across an ocean			1
the 39 - year - old from @entity1 , who has suffered nearly 20 lung collapses due to a condition known as @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , is part of a multinational crew taking part in the bi-annual @entity21 -- the only sailing race in the world where crews are made up by ordinary people , many with little or no sailing experience			1
this year more than 500 people from 41 countries are taking part in the 40,000 - mile relay race , which started in august 2011 and is set to finish later this month			1
the line - up this year consists of ten identical 68 - foot long yachts -- all sponsored by different cities around the world -- that are currently on the eighth and final leg of the race			1
@entity3 decided to get involved in the competition when she heard that the crew representing @entity39 would have a relay team of transplant patients , surgeons and specialist nurses on its boat to raise awareness for organ transplantation -- something that saved her life six years ago			1
" for years i suffered from chest pains but no one knew what was really wrong with me , " said @entity3 , who despite her pains led a very active life -- working at a gym and teaching children street dance in her spare time			1
" when i was 31 i suffered a double lung collapse and was rushed to hospital			1
they referred me to a specialist who found hundreds and hundreds of cysts in my lungs and i finally got diagnosed with ( this ) rare condition , " she said			0
the doctors told laymond that , with no functioning right lung and only 30 % capacity remaining in her left lung , she would be unable to have kids and that she would die if she did n't have a transplant			1
" my world fell to pieces , " said @entity3 , whose condition quickly deteriorated after she was diagnosed and left her in a three - week - long coma fighting for her life			2
she refers to this period as her " dark days , " as she was slipping in and out of consciousness while on life support			0
in 2006 , after 16 months of waiting and three false alarms , she finally received a new set of lungs in a 10 hour transplant operation , and she has n't looked back since			2
" i 'm definitely a bit of a fighter			0
because i had been in a coma i had to learn how to walk again and when i finally got out of hospital i decided to set myself daily challenges -- to do something different and to push my boundaries and defy the odds , " said @entity3 , who confessed that to date none of her challenges have been as difficult , or is ever likely to be as challenging as the @entity21 race			1
more from @entity99 : @entity100 says she 's relieved to be back on land indeed , it was far from plain sailing for @entity3 's crew on board the " @entity39 " yacht , whose @entity108 crossing was a grueling affair plagued by tropical storms and rough seas			2
with a weak immune system and only 60 % lung capacity it was a mammoth challenge for @entity3 : " towards the end i thought i could n't do it			1
the cold got into my lungs and i got so weak that i thought i might have to be airlifted off and go to hospital to get some fluids and real food			0
but the skipper and the rest of my team were so fantastic and supportive that i managed to hang in there			0
" her skipper @entity125 was impressed by @entity3 's determination and spirit : " @entity3 has done incredibly well , she had a tough race physically and she really grew with the race			1
" what she is representing is hugely empowering to people with similar conditions and she has certainly showed that anyone can do it			2
i think the whole team can be proud of what she has achieved , " he added			0
the @entity21 is the brainchild of @entity140 , the first person to ever sail solo nonstop around the world -- a feat which he managed to do in a journey that lasted 312 days between 1968 and 1969			2
watch : fastest man on water he said he came up with the idea for the unique race while he was exploring @entity148 in 1995 with @entity150 mountaineer @entity149 : " @entity149 was telling me how much it cost him to climb @entity153 and i thought to myself ' that 's a lot of money ' and then i asked myself what is the sailing equivalent of climbing the world 's biggest mountain and the answer was obvious , it 's the circumnavigation			0
" so i did some calculations on the back of a cigarette packet right there and then and i thought ' actually i could do a round the world race for half of what it costs to climb @entity153			0
' " the aim of the competition is to give everyone , regardless of sailing experience , the opportunity to experience the exhilaration of ocean racing			0
the first race took place in 1996 ; it consisted of eight boats and saw 300 people take part in the relay competition			1
see also : the enduring allure of tall ships since 1996 almost 3,000 people have competed in seven editions of the race , and although anyone can apply to take part , all selected crew members still have to pay a fee to join			1
it costs Â £ 10,000 ( around $ 15500 ) to do one leg and Â £ 43,000 ( around $ 67,000 ) to do the whole circumnavigation including four weeks of training			0
according to the organizers some people have sold their houses and given up their jobs to be able to join the challenge , others have managed to participate without " any money in the bank " by doing fundraising events			0
the only requirement is that you are over 18 and willing to work in a team and able to motivate yourself and others			0
motivate others is exactly what @entity3 hopes her story will do : " i have learned that life is too short -- so if you have a dream you just have to go out there and do it			2
" hopefully my story will inspire more people to become organ donors			2
it only takes minutes to register and it can save up to seven people 's lives			0
i 'm here because i 've been given the gift of life and without that donation it would never have been possible			0
