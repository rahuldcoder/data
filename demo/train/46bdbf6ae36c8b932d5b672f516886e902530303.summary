-- the @entity1 is fighting a push to award the @entity3 to victims of the 2009 massacre at @entity6 , @entity7 , fearing it could hurt the case against the army officer charged with turning on his comrades			1
" if you deal with the perpetrator of these crimes , he was a terrorist , essentially , " one of the bill 's co-sponsors , @entity7 @entity11 rep. @entity11 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity12			0
" we ought to treat these military men and women that were hurt like they were in a battlefield theater			0
" maj. @entity25 is awaiting a court - martial on charges that he gunned down 13 people and wounded 32 at @entity6 , the country 's largest @entity30 post			1
testimony is set to begin on july 1			0
but in a position paper obtained by @entity0 , the @entity1 argues that awarding the @entity3 to the @entity6 victims would make it harder to convict @entity25 in the death - penalty case and " deprive the victims of these crimes the right to see justice done			1
" " defense counsel will argue that @entity25 can not receive a fair trial because a branch of government has indirectly declared that @entity25 is a terrorist -- that he is criminally culpable , " the document states			1
that could lead to a delay of the case or the reversal of a guilty verdict on appeal , it continued			0
" this laudable sentiment mistakenly and unwillingly supplants the criminal trial process by infusing official , formal statutory conclusions about the motive , intent and culpability of the man charged with the crime , " the memo reads			1
prosecutors aim to show that the @entity25 , an @entity63 citizen of @entity65 descent , was a radical @entity66			2
witnesses reported that @entity25 opened fire with two pistols , yelling " @entity70 " -- @entity71 for " @entity72 is great " -- as he shot troops preparing to deploy to @entity74			2
investigations have found that he had been communicating via e-mail with radical @entity78 - @entity63 cleric @entity77 , who was killed by a @entity63 drone attack in 2011			0
@entity25 had been scheduled to deploy to @entity74 before the killings but had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military			1
the bill has the support of former house speaker and @entity87 presidential hopeful @entity86 , who dismissed the @entity1 's concerns about a fair trial in an interview on @entity0 's @entity91			1
" does anybody doubt he was in the room ? does anyone doubt he yelled ' allahu akbar ? ' does anyone doubt he shot all those people ? " @entity98 asked			2
" we have a lawyer - driven system that is sick			0
" @entity98 said the military has " bent over backwards " to avoid declaring the killings an act of terrorism			1
by comparison , he said , @entity107 spies caught during @entity108 were tried and executed " in a matter of weeks			0
" " there is no question this man is guilty			2
zero , " he said			0
@entity1 spokesman @entity117 declined to comment monday , citing the pending case			2
but a congressional source , speaking on condition of anonymity because of the legal concerns , called the military 's position " dead wrong			1
" " if they stand by this , they should ask for all the @entity1 's 9/11 award recipients to give their medals back , " the source said			1
" they 're not gon na do that , though			0
" the @entity1 document notes that victims of an international terrorist attack are eligible for the @entity3			1
but expanding that to include domestic crimes or terrorism , it asserts , " would be a dramatic departure from the traditional @entity3 award criteria			0
" " ultimately , such an unprecedented action would thwart the real and lasting measure that will bring closure to the grieving and harmed victims and families -- the trial itself , " the position paper states			2
however , the bill @entity11 co-sponsored states that the @entity152 branded the @entity6 killings a " terrorist attack " in a 2011 report			0
" it basically just says if you were shot at @entity6 that day or you were shot in @entity74 , you 're treated exactly the same , " @entity11 said .			0

@entity158 : " there is no question this man is guilty , " @entity98 says
*lawmakers* want to make @entity6 victims eligible for the @entity3
the @entity1 says the " laudable sentiment " could *hamper* the trial of maj. @entity25
a congressional source calls the military 's position " dead wrong "
