-- @entity1 is having a very good year ... in @entity2			1
anticipation is building for the film version of journalist @entity6 's immensely popular book " @entity11 " ( due in theaters in december ) , @entity8 - based streaming service @entity9 just launched last month in the @entity2 to acclaim from tech blogs , and branches of @entity1 discount store @entity14 are opening in malls across @entity2 with their winning formula of designer duds at bargain basement prices ( the first @entity20 outpost of the chain debuted last week in @entity22 )			1
but the way the @entity24 nation is most influencing @entity2 this year is via several stellar singer / songwriters who are resonating with fans in a way not seen in the @entity2 since acts like @entity31 and @entity32 ruled the airwaves and @entity34			1
today , the names to know are @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , all of whom have suddenly moved beyond cult status and crept into the mainstream , selling out shows and popping up on some of the largest radio stations in @entity2			1
the @entity2 ' embrace of @entity1 this year has pleased one artist , @entity36 , who has taken the proverbial long road to success over the past 15 years or so			1
" i have been touring this record since may 2010 to continue what i started with the last album , " she said after an appearance on " @entity50 with @entity51 " earlier this month			0
" i wanted to build my audience in the @entity2 in an organic way			1
it seems to work , although it 's very hard for me to say why			0
... i hope it 's because the music is good			0
" for the humble performer , who is known for her quirky outfits and earnest delivery devoid of pop star artifice , being @entity1 is paramount to her personality , and by extension , her music			1
" because of where we are geographically , we probably see ourselves as outsiders , " she explained when asked why @entity1 seems to produce so many interesting artists who are winning fans across multiple genres of music at the moment			2
" we consume and are fascinated by @entity78 culture , and i think that has made it possible for us to make music that makes sense in the big world as well , " she added			0
proof of @entity36 's assertion could be found at @entity86 's @entity88 festival earlier this month , where progressive bookers reportedly laid out more than $ 2 million to land names such as @entity91 and @entity92 to play alongside homegrown talents such as @entity94 and @entity36 as a cross-pollination experiment -- providing a heady mélange of influences that thrilled and will likely inspire young @entity1 who are already avid fans of rappers such as @entity92 as well as more traditional songwriters			1
just as @entity1 are interested in uniquely @entity78 artists like @entity91 , so too are @entity2 becoming curious about quintessentially @entity1 names such as @entity36			1
the singer topped many critics ' top 10 lists last year with her " @entity111 " series , which is still selling slowly , though steadily , this year as the passionate 32 - year - old keeps converting new fans via video releases on @entity109 and buzzed - about live shows			0
but it 's not just @entity36 cutting deep into the hearts of @entity2 music fans			1
@entity37 has seen surprising success abroad with a different sound that is proving no less appealing to many			2
the singer recently sold out shows at @entity120 ' @entity119 and @entity122 's @entity121 and has received airplay on influential rock station @entity124 and elsewhere			2
her new record , " @entity125 , " has so far sold around 62,000 copies , per @entity127 , and is tipped as one to top many critical @entity130 lists this year			0
in the indie rock world , where acts from @entity8 's ripe experimental pop scene have long been championed , names such as @entity132 , @entity133 and the @entity134 continue to excite adventurous music consumers			2
however , it 's dance music where @entity1 has truly left its mark recently , and 2011 is proving a banner year for @entity1 djs such as @entity142 , @entity38 and @entity143 -- all of whom are connecting with young fans of house music who flock to festivals such as @entity150 ' massive @entity149			1
the djs spotlight sweeping , optimistic anthems that pulse with confidence and aspire outward with an escapist sound big enough to fill any void in a globally depressed economy			0
" it 's so cold in @entity1 and there 's nothing much to do ... a lot of us dream of getting out , " said @entity142 , aka @entity142 , after a set in @entity158 where the 21 - year - old played to a crowd of around 25,000 people			2
" we see the success of people like @entity38 and it 's an inspiration			2
" it 's that success of @entity1 abroad that seems to be the key to why @entity1 outperforms its @entity175 neighbors in the music industry			2
despite a wealth of talent from countries such as @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 , it 's only @entity1 that has numerous blogs such as @entity122 's @entity185 and @entity187 's @entity186 obsessively tracking new music from the @entity24 nation			2
@entity1 influences are being felt in @entity2 in major @entity2 cities such as @entity120 , which boasts bands aping the " @entity1 sound			1
" @entity195 , in fact , has long been connected to @entity8 in music circles , and the cities are only getting closer			0
@entity1 producers living and working in @entity120 , such as @entity198 ( who has penned hits for artists such as @entity201 and plans a permanent move to @entity120 this fall with his family ) and @entity204 ( @entity205 ) , have helped craft a sound that has all but taken over urban and pop radio formats in the @entity2			1
when labels or managers need an uplifting hit , @entity1 often get the call			0
so what 's the secret that 's made @entity1 a virtual hit factory since the days of @entity215 ? the reasons are myriad , but @entity218 - born , @entity120 - based producer / songwriter @entity217 has a few ideas			1
" there 's more focus on melody in @entity1 , " said the co-founder of music - licensing company @entity221			0
" @entity1 has a very strong folk music tradition spanning back 800 years at least which is almost all melody driven , " continued the producer , who is fresh off work on a @entity228 record			0
" @entity1 folk music is so melancholic and melodious and i seem to find those qualities in @entity1 modern music as well , " she said			0
" a lot of countries do n't have that melody tradition , but us @entity1 are pretty crafty			0
... we like to engineer and make sure everything is perfect , " @entity217 said			0
for music lovers in @entity2 , that quixotic quest for melodic pop perfection has not gone unnoticed in 2011 .			0
