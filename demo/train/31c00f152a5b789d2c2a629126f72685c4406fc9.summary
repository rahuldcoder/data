@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 released a new proposed rule thursday designed to strengthen school breakfast and lunch nutrition standards -- part of the @entity10 administration 's attempt to crack down on an epidemic of childhood obesity			1
the rule would increase the availability of fruits , vegetables , whole grains and low - fat milk while cutting the amount of sodium and saturated fat			1
it would reduce the availability of traditional school lunch staples such as pizza and french fries			1
under the rule , federal minimum and maximum calorie intake guidelines would be established for the first time			1
younger children would be offered 550 to 650 calories for lunch , while most high school students would be offered 750 to 850 calories			2
saturated fat would constitute less than 10 percent of the total calories in school meals for children at all age levels			2
trans fat would be banned			0
if implemented , the rule will affect an estimated 32 million school lunches and 12 million school breakfasts every year , according to agriculture secretary @entity43			1
public health advocates praised the proposal , arguing it will encourage better lifelong eating habits			0
if children " eat healthy foods at schools and like them , they 're going to be more open to eating healthy food at home and throughout the rest of their lives , " said @entity48 , director of nutrition policy at the @entity49			0
some conservatives , however , contend that enforcement of nutrition standards in school meals is not an appropriate role for the federal government			2
the proposed rule is open for public comment through mid-april			2
once the rule takes effect , school districts will be required to meet its standards to be eligible for federal assistance for school meals			1
almost one - third of @entity3 children between the ages of 6 and 19 are overweight or obese , according to a recent study conducted by the @entity75			0

" if the obesity problem is n't effectively dealt with , the country could face an additional $ 344 billion in health care costs by 2018 , @entity43 told reporters			0
president @entity10 signed a sweeping overhaul of child nutrition standards in december , enacting a law meant to encourage better eating habits in part by giving the federal government more authority to set standards for food sold in vending machines and elsewhere on school grounds			1
the new proposed rule is a consequence of the $ 4.5 billion measure			0
among other things , the law provides more money to poor areas to subsidize school lunches			1
to help offset the higher cost of including more fruits and vegetables , the bill increases the reimbursement rate for the program			1
the measure was a top priority for first lady @entity123 , who championed it as part of her " @entity128 " initiative to combat child obesity in the @entity3			0
