-- like two heavyweight boxers slugging it out over 12 rounds , @entity1 and @entity2 stood toe - to - toe			1
with darkness descending , the pair traded blows for a remarkable two hours before @entity2 , at 31 eight years @entity1 's junior , triumphed in the longest and most dramatic golfing playoff of 2011			1
in the end , @entity2 's six - foot birdie putt on the sixth extra hole of october 's @entity13 in @entity14 proved enough to snatch victory and ensured that @entity1 's 348th @entity18 event would go the same way as the previous 347			1
when @entity0 contacted @entity1 we expected to find a man down on his fortunes , ruing another missed opportunity to finally claim the first tour victory of his career			1
yet nothing could have been further from the truth			0
the 39 - year - old @entity29 native was out fishing , relaxing on his 22 - foot @entity32 boat in a bay off @entity34 on the @entity36 coast , about 90 minutes north of @entity37			1
and he already had his dinner plans taken care of for the evening			0
" i 've caught two speckled trout and one red fish , " he told me enthusiastically			0
" i am going to a friend 's house later , where we will clean them up and have them for dinner			0
i only really play golf so i can support my fishing ! " if that really is the case , then @entity1 's fishing hobby has been pretty well supported over the years , to the tune of $ 12,460,542 to be precise , and his latest heartbreaking near - miss added another $ 540,000 to the coffers			1
that impressive prize fund puts him in 87th position on the all - time @entity18 money list , ahead of such luminaries and major winners as @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and the legendary @entity66 , to name just a few			1
" i would rather be the guy who has won the most money without a victory than the guy who has won the least money ! a stat is only as bad as you want it to be , " said @entity1			1
" if you are going to do something for a living that you love to do , and you are financially rewarded for doing it , that is a complete bonus			0
on the flip side , the negative is true and i can not deny it			0
i am not out there trying ' not to win			0
' not winning is not something i relish			2
" golfing is in @entity86 's blood -- his nickname comes from a character in @entity90 's novel " @entity89 , " which his mother was reading when @entity1 was a young boy			1
the son of professional @entity93 , the young @entity1 was introduced to the sport at a very early age			1
" my dad being a golfer was a big part of my life growing up			0
it gave me an insight into how you should go about playing golf and he was a good player -- winning twice on the @entity18			1
" he was completely hands on -- my golf swing was made by my father -- but my parents went through a really bad divorce when i was 18 and i and have n't spoken to my dad for eight years			0
" from three to 18 , everything i learned , 100 % , was from my dad			0
the next 20 years , nothing through him			0
" @entity1 pauses for a moment , before continuing : " people are disbelieving when i tell them , but for me it is a non-issue			1
" i think people find it more shocking because we both have the same careers -- they do n't relate to it as life , just golf			0
my dad and i do n't speak because of life , not because of golf			0
" @entity1 's early college years were spent in exalted golfing company at @entity124 " i was in the same golf team as @entity126 and @entity127 ( both winners of the @entity129 )			2
" we had a great time and are all still firm friends now , but out of school i did n't enjoy it as much , so i left for @entity134 school @entity133 , where i had a blast ... and met my wife ! " despite becoming a millionaire from playing the sport he loves , @entity1 has also experienced the downside of being a professional			1
he lost his @entity18 card in 2004 , agonizingly finishing one place outside the top 125 players that are invited back , while last year he again just missed out , finishing 127th			1
that meant he was playing on a limited schedule this year , although his second place in @entity14 ensures no such worries for 2012			2
" having to play in the qualifying school sucks , it is not fun at all , " says @entity1			2
" you are playing for your job for the entire year and possibly for your entire career -- it is more pressure than any other tournament			1
a guy can miss a putt on the 18th hole and not have a tour card as a result			0
" perhaps the phrase is overused , but @entity1 is genuinely one of golf 's nice guys			2
we chat away for over half an hour like old friends and nothing seems too much trouble for him , although the feeling remains that finishing second for a fifth time in his career , and in such dramatic circumstances , will leave an indelible mark on @entity1			1
but his mood is upbeat , positive and determined			0
@entity1 is convinced he will win a tournament one day			1
" look , i am not going to lie to you , it was a massive disappointment to lose that playoff			0
i honestly felt i was going to win the tournament			2
i know i can win on tour			0
in fact , i know i can win more than once on tour , " he says			0
" i walked away thinking i had done things i had n't done before			0
i played to win and in my mind i knew i was going to win			2
" i felt in control and played really good coming down the stretch			2
i do n't know how many times i have done that , for me that was a big hurdle to overcome			2
" if self belief was a golf tournament , @entity1 would be a multiple winner , and his latest narrow defeat will not dent his confidence or dilute his desire to secure that elusive first victory			1
golf 's richest runner - up is determined to reel in that big prize soon , do n't be surprised if he hooks his biggest - ever catch in 2012 .			2

the 39 - year - old is ranked in 87th position in the all - time @entity18 money list
