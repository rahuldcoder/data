@entity0 reigned in many parts of @entity2 and the surrounding region of @entity4 on monday , a day after 1.6 million people there cast symbolic votes to secede from @entity8			1
but the sentiment for @entity11 independence was not shared in @entity12 , where there was skepticism , as @entity8 's justice minister called the straw vote a " farce " without any democratic validity			1
even after more than 2 million @entity11 voted on sunday , defying two decisions by @entity8 's highest court that it was illegal to cast a ballot on independence , the two entrenched sides -- the @entity11 government in @entity8 's second largest city of @entity2 and the @entity8 government in the capital , @entity12 -- seemed no closer to solving the thorny issue			1
@entity11 secessionists have staged massive street demonstrations in recent years , and they picked up more steam in september around @entity32 's referendum on independence			1
although @entity32 voted to remain in the @entity33 , many @entity11 insisted @entity12 should let them vote , too , as @entity34 had done for @entity32			2
but the @entity8 government insists that the constitution does not permit just one of @entity8 's 17 regions , such as @entity4 , to unilaterally secede			1
none of that mattered on sunday to many in @entity4 , in northeast @entity8 , where the regional government , backed by 40,000 volunteers instead of regular election officials , staged the symbolic vote			1
the result was heavily in favor of independence , but analysts said many who opposed secession simply did n't bother to vote , since it was non-binding			2
turnout was about 32 % , far lower than the nearly 70 % who voted in regional , binding , parliamentary elections two years ago			0
@entity4 represents about 20 % of @entity8 's economy and already has broad home - rule powers , including its own parliament , police force and control over education and health			2
the region also has a long list of grievances with @entity12 , including over taxation			0
the @entity11 president , @entity67 , on sunday called on @entity8 prime minister @entity68 to negotiate a " definitive " referendum			0
but @entity68 said earlier in the weekend that he could only talk within the bounds of the @entity8 constitution and law			0
with the two leaders seemingly at loggerheads , some analysts predicted the real talks would be about more home rule for @entity4 ,			0
others said the crisis could mean early regional elections in @entity4 , where polls indicate that a party even more devoted to secession than the one currently in power would win .			0

over 2 million @entity11 voted on sunday , defying decisions by @entity8 's highest court
