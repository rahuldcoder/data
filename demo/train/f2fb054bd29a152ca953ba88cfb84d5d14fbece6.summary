@entity0 , @entity1 -- the main runway at @entity1 's busiest airport reopened friday , 10 days after a passenger jet skidded off its rain - slicked surface and crashed , killing almost 200 people in the country 's worst aviation disaster			1
at least 12 people also were killed on the ground when the @entity13 plane rammed into a cargo terminal			2
authorities opened the recently repaved runway at @entity0 's @entity17 even though it has not yet been entirely grooved to drain rainwater and prevent planes from slipping when they touch down			1
landings will be restricted in wet weather until the surface is completely grooved , which could take weeks			0
in the meantime , flights arriving in heavy rains will touch down on the backup runway at @entity17 or be diverted to the city 's @entity28			1
the main runway at @entity0 's @entity31 was reopened after being inspected by new defense minister @entity32 , who was appointed wednesday to overhaul @entity1 's ailing aviation sector			1
the defense ministry and the air force oversee airports and air traffic in @entity1			2
the runway , one of the shortest in the country , has been at the center of a fierce debate over air safety since an @entity44 carrying 187 people crashed in a botched landing attempt on july 17			1
the plane , flown by @entity1 carrier @entity13 , barreled off the landing strip in the rain and rammed into a cargo terminal and gas station , bursting into flames			2
everyone on board and at least 12 more on the ground were killed in the accident			0
authorities are investigating if the runway , which is known for being slippery , was unsafe for landing in the rain			0
investigators also are trying to determine if possible pilot error and mechanical problems contributed to the crash			0
air travel in @entity1 descended further into chaos after the accident , the second major aviation disaster in the country in 10 months			1
in september , 154 people were killed when a @entity70 clipped wings in midair with a private jet and crashed in the @entity75 jungle			2
the closure of the main runway at @entity17 after the @entity13 crash forced airlines to cancel hundreds of flights and caused a ripple effect of delays around the country			1
since then , revolts at ticket counters have become routine and some airlines have even urged passengers to travel by bus			0
air travel was slowly starting to return to normal friday , with fewer delays and cancellations around the country , according to @entity1 's airports authority @entity93			1
at @entity31 , however , 40 percent of all flights were canceled friday morning before the runway reopened			0
