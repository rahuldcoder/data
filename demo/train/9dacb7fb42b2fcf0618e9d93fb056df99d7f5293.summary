@entity0 -- nearly seven decades after the end of @entity5 , @entity3 prime minister @entity2 is expected thursday to call for long - standing limits on the country 's military to be eased to allow it to come to the aid of allies under attack			1
@entity2 's drive to revamp @entity3 security policy comes at a time of rising tensions with @entity17 and concerns over @entity20 's nuclear weapons program			1
but the prospect of a historic reinterpretation of the country 's pacifist constitution has caused unease both within @entity26 and abroad			1
the @entity27 , @entity0 's main ally and the nation that oversaw the adoption of the constitution in 1947 , has supported the idea of @entity26 's military taking on a more assertive role in the world			1
as things stand , @entity26 can only use its military , known as the @entity37 , to defend itself			2
article 9 of the constitution , written in the aftermath of @entity26 's defeat by the allies , says the @entity3 people " forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes			1
" if , for example , a @entity27 ship came under attack in the @entity54 , @entity26 would not be able to offer military help unless it was also threatened			0
public opinion divided @entity2 , who is eager to strengthen @entity0 's alliance with @entity58 , wants @entity26 to be able to participate in collective self - defense and take a more proactive role in peacekeeping missions			1
he set up an advisory panel on @entity26 's security policy , which delivered its report to him on thursday			2
@entity2 is expected to announce his response to the panel 's conclusions and outline how he plans to proceed			1
he is unlikely to try to change the constitution , a formidable political challenge that would need the backing of two - thirds of both houses of @entity73 and a referendum			0
instead , he is expected to propose a reinterpretation of the existing text			0
opinion polls suggest @entity26 is deeply divided over the idea of such a change , with different surveys showing drastically different levels of support and opposition			0
the constitution , considered by many @entity3 to have kept the country out of war since 1945 , is widely respected			2
using national security arguments to reinterpret the @entity93 on the issue of collective self - defense would " in effect , eviscerate the constitution , " warned a commentary published wednesday in the @entity88 , a leading @entity89 - language daily newspaper in @entity26			1
@entity27 support but one of @entity2 's advisers , @entity99 , told @entity1 's @entity100 last month that @entity26 has adopted a " strange interpretation " of the constitution for " historical reasons			1
" " everyone , every individual , and every nation " has the right to " act collectively with your like - minded peers , " he said			0
a reinterpretation would still require the support of @entity2 's governing coalition , including the @entity113 , which is considered to have a strong pacifist leaning			0
the @entity27 government , facing complex security challenges around the world , has made it clear it favors a change in @entity26 's military stance			2
" the @entity27 welcomes @entity26 's efforts to play a more proactive role in contributing to global and regional peace and stability , including reexamining the interpretation of its @entity93 relating to the rights of collective self - defense , " defense secretary @entity121 said during a visit to @entity0 last month			2
@entity17 criticism however , @entity17 , whose rising military spending has been cited by @entity3 officials as a reason to adapt , has voiced criticism of the suggested changes			2
" @entity2 's goal , while stripping a nation of its pacifist identity , simultaneously serves to endanger the lives of the nation 's citizens as their country remilitarizes and , for all intents and purposes , becomes ' war ready , ' " @entity17 's official news agency @entity137 said in an analysis article last week			1
some commentators in the @entity150 have also expressed concern about the way @entity2 appears to be going about the policy overhaul			0
" the government 's ' reinterpretation ' is the most profound challenge to the pacifist constitution since 1947 , " a column in the @entity156 magazine @entity155 said this week			0
and an editorial in the @entity162 warned that " such an act would completely undermine the democratic process			0
" @entity1 's @entity165 reported from @entity0 , and @entity166 reported and wrote from @entity167			0
@entity1 's @entity168 contributed to this report .			0

prime minister @entity2 is expected to outline plans to change defense policy
the country 's constitution renounces using force to settle international disputes
but @entity2 wants to reinterpret it to allow @entity3 forces to defend allies
that has *prompted* concerns within @entity26 and from @entity17
