i 'm not mad at @entity1 , or @entity2			1
those people who are up - in - arms that @entity1 has climbed back to his standing as the world 's no. 1 golfer and that he is no longer asking for our forgiveness are hypocrites			1
" @entity13 , " proclaims his most recent @entity2 ad , as a focused @entity1 crouches in the background			1
when i first saw the ad , i thought : wow , bold move by @entity2			1
it 's an in - your - face , unapologetic statement			2
back in 2009 , when @entity1 took his public plunge into disgrace by cheating on his wife with a long list of silicone - enhanced beauties , we criticized him for being a fake			1
we said he 'd lied not only to his wife but also to his adoring public , who apparently thought he was a near - @entity28			0
we said he was the role model for our kids			0
but i never thought it was @entity1 's job to teach my son how to be a responsible , loving husband or father			1
that 's a job for parents			2
of course , i 'm not excusing his behavior , but i am not his judge			0
his wife and family -- and @entity1 himself -- really were the only ones hurt by his actions			1
well , now @entity1 is being real			1
he 's being honest with the public			2
he 's finally speaking his mind so there can be no question of what type of man he is today			2
and i say , good for him			2
does winning really take care of everything in @entity1 ' life ? and good for @entity2 for standing by him through what was in the end just a personal flaw			1
it 's not like he 's @entity59 , who used enhancement drugs throughout his career and sabotaged an entire sport for years			1
woods did not have to give back his championships because he cheated his sport , his fans or his sponsors			1
do n't be mad at @entity1			1
it was never him we were disappointed in anyway			0
it was the cheating boyfriend or spouse who broke our hearts and split up our families			0
be mad at the problems in your own personal life			0
or , be mad at yourself			0
i know when i 've screwed up , if i 'm honest , the first person to be upset with is myself			0
@entity1 has nothing to do with my life or relationships			1
the @entity2 ad may be offensive to those who do n't quite understand sports culture , or work in extremely competitive environments such as sales , or @entity89 , and even politics			1
but in those worlds , nothing could be truer than " winning takes care of everything			1
" in those worlds you are only as good as your last big win			1
photos : redemption through sports how many times have we said to ourselves at work : " i can turn my career around with one success on my next project ? " or , " one win will make my bosses happy and all will be forgotten ? " how many of us say to our kids who play sports : " @entity114 in there			2
all you need is one game - winning goal and that will change everything			2
everyone will forget you have n't scored all season			0
" winning does change things			0
just think of @entity127 champion @entity126 , who the @entity128 calls one of the best men to ever play the game			0
or former @entity132 football coach @entity131 , who was a king for a decade , surviving numerous scandals until he was forced to resign amid @entity135 rules sanctions			0
@entity131 then went on to work for the @entity128			0
why ? because he knows how to win			0
does anyone think @entity137 would have lasted so long at @entity138 among the allegations of child sex abuse if the football program was down - and - out ? no , sadly , it was the winning and the big money that kept @entity137 and others safe			2
@entity146 , even @entity147 and @entity148 reclaimed their status as kingmakers after personal disgraces			0
we are a forgiving nation			0
for me , nothing is better than someone who can get back up and succeed after a bloody knockout			2
and i hope this time around he can relax , be himself and enjoy the game .			0

@entity2 's new ad about @entity1 proclaims " winning takes care of everything "
@entity166 : we criticized @entity1 for his *infidelity* , but he never cheated his sport
she says in the world of competitive sports you are only as good as your last big win
@entity179 : for me , nothing is better than someone who can get back up after a knockout
