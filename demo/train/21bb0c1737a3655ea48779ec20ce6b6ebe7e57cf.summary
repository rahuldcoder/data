-- @entity2 's new rule banning driver coaching on team radios is now in place , but it was a message going in the other direction that summed up the fine line between success and failure for this season 's title contenders			1
" dammit ! " uttered a frustrated @entity12 after being gazumped by @entity14 teammate @entity13 at the end of qualifying for sunday 's @entity17			1
the @entity18 was pipped by just seven - thousandths of a second under lights at the marina bay street circuit on saturday , giving his @entity23 rival the chance to further chip into his 22 - point lead			0
@entity13 won the last race at @entity28 after starting on pole , battling back to beat @entity12 after losing his early advantage , and a seventh victory this season would give him the momentum as the campaign moves towards its climax			1
" seven - thousandths ! when i think back at the lap , it 's nothing , " @entity12 , seeking his first world title , told reporters when asked to explain his radio outburst			1
" but that 's the way it is			2
@entity13 did a good job to get pole			1
@entity47 is okay , first would be better , but there 's a long race ahead so it 's fine			1
" @entity13 has not won in @entity51 since the year after his sole world title success in 2008			1
" to have the last lap at the end like that is always the plan , although it does n't always go to plan like it did , " said the @entity53 , who like @entity12 had moved past late pacesetter @entity54 at the end of the third and final session			1
" on the last lap i locked up in turn one , lost some time , although i made it back in other areas , i kept going			2
it was an exciting qualifying session			0
i was n't expecting to see so many people up there fighting			0
" @entity54 was 0.73 seconds behind @entity12 and 0.48s ahead of fourth - placed @entity71 teammate @entity70 -- who has won the @entity51 race for the past three years			1
" we came into the weekend thinking if we were within two to three - tenths of a second that would give us a chance to stay with them , " said @entity74 , who is the only other driver outside the @entity14 duo to have won a race this year			1
" so to end up being closer than we thought , it 's been a good day			2
hopefully i can keep it up tomorrow and get a better view from the podium			0
" four - time world champion @entity70 was 0.005s ahead of @entity87 , who was 0.093s in front of his former @entity90 teammate @entity89 , now at @entity91			2
@entity87 's current teammate @entity92 was back in seventh			0
the @entity94 was fastest in @entity95 but was unable to set a final lap in @entity97 due to a power problem			1
@entity89 's teammate @entity99 was eighth ahead of rookies @entity102 of @entity103 and @entity104 of @entity105			0
@entity102 's teammate @entity106 failed to make @entity97 , and the 2009 world champion -- twice a runner - up in @entity51 -- will start in 11th place			2
@entity106 had said friday that he hoped the rule banning radio coaching would give experienced drivers an advantage			0
" it is probably not such good news for @entity14 , who coach their drivers , but i have never been coached around a lap anyway -- where to go quick and where to go slow , " said the 34 - year - old			1
" now we are masters of our own fate			0
" both @entity13 and @entity12 have ignored team instructions this season as they have fought a bitter battle for the title , but these arguments have related more to race strategy as opposed to specific coaching of how to negotiate circuits			1
" when the driver is on the track he should be driving the car himself , " @entity2 race director @entity133 told reporters friday			2
" whether he receives coaching outside an event , he 's perfectly at liberty to do that of course			0
but once he 's out on that track , he should be doing it himself			0
that 's the reason for the rule and that 's the reason why we believe we have to enforce it			0
" if a team informs a driver to change his brake balance , that 's absolutely fine , provided it 's not for a specific part of the circuit			2
so , in other words , one click forward for @entity157 and two clicks backward for @entity159 , those are the sort of things we consider to be driver coaching , assisting the driver			0
" a global change to the brake balance , or any other similar parameter on the car , would be for overall performance , which is fine			0
" interactive : take a tour of @entity174 circuit			0
