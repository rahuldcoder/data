-- has your @entity2 feed become a gauzy parade of white gowns and veils ? you 're not alone			1
those status updates that declare undying love , with pictures to prove it , can stop you in your tracks			1
suddenly the life that was keeping you completely contented only moments ago looks like a series of doors shutting in your face			2
as a single 27 - year - old career woman , the summer wedding season brought it home for me			1
it was n't the seemingly endless slew of princess gowns and big , shiny rocks dominating my newsfeed per se			2
sure , i 'll admit to a touch of dress envy			0
but it 's nothing that an online shopping session ca n't fix			2
it 's not even that i 'm lonely			2
i 've long prided myself on my bravery and willingness to try new things			0
in pursuit of my dream career , i have moved to new cities by myself , met amazing people , had exciting experiences and even got some world travel in along the way			0
i love my life and the choices i 've made			1
yet as the smiling faces of girls in white dresses i had n't seen since high school stared at me from my computer screen , i could n't help but feel i was suddenly looking at the path i had n't taken			0
i love the choices i 've made , but did i regret some of them ? " i , unlike the @entity2 updates in regards to weddings and babies have spent my 20s going to grad school , teaching both overseas / out of state and traveling , " an old college friend recently wrote me			1
" despite being content and loving it ( most of the time ) , it 's easy to question your lifestyle when you see those around you ( via facebook ) settling down and choosing different paths , leaving you to question your own			2
" " the newsfeed crushes my soul on a daily basis , " said another friend whose wedding pics i recently ogled on @entity2			1
" between the babies and people getting to travel to awesome places that i can not afford , it drives me nuts			2
also the awful girl from undergrad who currently has my dream job / life and frequently posts about how awesome it is ...			1
" she 's got a point			2
it 's not only the weddings , but the awesome jobs and enviable social lives			1
oh , right , and the babies			2
i 'm lucky not to feel the twinges of baby envy yet			0
in fact , while the giggling , gurgling , smiling faces are cute , seeing them on my newsfeed helps put my own choices in perspective			1
what 's right for someone else probably is n't right for me			2
not right now , anyway			0
face it , @entity2 : sometimes you suck the conclusion my friend helped me draw was a good one			1
for every profile i stalk that makes me contemplate the choices i did or did n't make , someone out there may be thinking the same thing about my latest vacation photos or newest bylines			0
so what gives ? are we all doomed until we delete our accounts ? maybe , says dr. @entity114 , radio host and licensed clinical psychologist			1
" when people who are like us seem to be getting something we want there is certainly a tinge , but we like them for other reasons			0
" if a friend calls to say she is engaged , promoted , packing up to spend a month in @entity124 , it is normal to feel jealous , @entity121 said			0
but the intimacy of true friendship often mitigates whatever unpleasant feelings may creep up when you hear something good is happening to someone else			0
tired of baby pics on @entity2 ? try this ! with @entity2 , that true intimacy is n't there , @entity121 said			1
" if you got engaged , you 'd certainly call a limited number of people and they 'd be happy for you			0
" instead , @entity2 creates what @entity114 calls pseudo-intimacy			1
a global posting board for those you kind of know or once knew to list their achievements neatly for you to ponder and compare with your own			0
" it 's a public forum for what is basically private information , " @entity121 said			0
another friend told me @entity2 has made her compare the life she has to one she left behind			1
" just seeing so many from grade school going through big life changes and it makes you question what you 're doing , " she said			0
" i see people buying houses and i am still throwing my money away on rent			0
but i think that is normal when you live in a city and come from a small town			0
" another friend said , " @entity2 , the good , lets me feel like i 'm still in the loop with everyone			1
i know where people went on someone 's birthday , or who got what job or went on what vacation without having to actually be there			0
@entity2 , the bad , gives you that fear of missing out			1
or the fear that i made the wrong choice in moving			0
this feeling usually comes around big holidays or events like a birthday or the million wedding things that are going on			0
" to combat these feelings , @entity114 said , " my first suggestion is you do n't use @entity2 as your primary barometer of how your life is going			1
you just do n't have enough underpinning to evaluate the statements			0
" as for dealing with the jealously that can crop up while cruising @entity2 , my friends recommended stepping away from the computer and soaking in some sunshine or a spending time with nonvirtual people , to keep things in perspective			1
so now when @entity2 makes me long for someone else 's fairy tale , i just remember that life is full of give and take , luck and circumstance , decisions carefully weighed , successes and struggles			1
a status update is n't your life story			2
