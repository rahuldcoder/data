-- singer - songwriter @entity1 released a new album on april 17 in honor of @entity4 called " @entity1 : @entity5			1
" it 's a collection of live highlights from the festival over the years featuring some legendary names in music : @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			0
but the album is about more than just music			0
the proceeds from both the festival and the album go back to @entity1 's @entity18 to promote conservation efforts in @entity20			1
@entity1 and his wife , @entity21 , are natives of @entity20 , and for years they have been champions of conservation , environmental awareness and education both in their native state and around the world			1
" we decided to create the foundation because i stole my wife away from teaching geometry and she became my first tour manager , and ... she wanted to be involved in education again			0
their foundation got them both back into @entity38 classrooms			0
the @entity18 supports environmental education in schools and communities throughout @entity20			2
the main programs the foundation has implemented since its creation in 2003 promote recycling and taking children out of the classroom and into the environment for hands - on learning experiences			1
most recently , the foundation introduced the @entity53 program to reduce single - use plastic on the @entity55			2
" the @entity18 's programs are really hands - on and get kids out into nature			1
usually , they are having so much fun that they do n't realize how much they are learning , " @entity1 said			2
to raise money for the foundation , the @entity63 created the @entity66 in 2004			1
the festival is held every year on @entity4 weekend outdoors in @entity69 's @entity68			2
@entity1 brings in friends in the music industry who share his passion for environmental preservation			0
" all of the musicians who 've played at the @entity66 have a connection to the cause and the work we are doing with the foundation , " @entity1 says			1
" the musicians themselves were a big inspiration for the foundation from the start -- like how @entity11 runs his tour buses and trucks on biodiesel and how @entity13 has been active in several environmental causes			0
" " for me , it 's wonderful to get the chance to play with these musicians i respect and have loved for years , to share some great music with them and use that music to help raise funds we need to keep @entity18 's programs going			1
hopefully , that inspiration goes both ways , and the musicians who join us will implement some of the greening measures from the festival into their own tours			0
" in addition to the music , the festival also continues in the educational tradition of the foundation			0
more than 50 eco-friendly businesses and local environmental groups set up shop in the @entity109 , which is much like what @entity1 does on tour			0
here , the fans can learn about sustainable products , watch alternative energy demonstrations and sample local food and beverages			0
another element that mirrors @entity1 's efforts on tour : there are free water refill stations to encourage the use of reusable water bottles .			1
