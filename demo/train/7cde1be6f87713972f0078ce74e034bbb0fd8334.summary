-- it was just before @entity2 when @entity3 mulled over events in his troubled land and concluded that everything had been done to ensure loss for him at the polls			1
an election rife with fraud had ousted him from the race			2
@entity3 's dreams of leading @entity13 were all but dead			1
but four months of recounts and reviews and then a runoff changed everything , and the unexpected candidate is poised now to move into the presidential office			2
unexpected because @entity3 has never been a politician			1
he 's better known as " @entity3 , " a popular kompa singer who enthralled his fans with bad - boy antics on stage			1
he cursed and swayed with a bottle of @entity25 in his hands and on occasion , mooned his audience			2
it 's an image that @entity3 said he cultivated solely for the stage			1
still , it led many to question whether he was fit to run a nation , especially one as beleaguered as @entity13			0
already the poorest nation in the @entity34 , @entity13 is reeling from devastation caused by last year 's massive earthquake followed by a cholera epidemic later in the year			1
a perceived lack of progress prompted @entity40 to vote against @entity41 , the government - backed candidate			1
@entity3 , they said , was a fresh face in politics , untainted by the corruption that has marred many a presidency in @entity13			1
" @entity40 , particularly the legions of young and jobless , @entity3 is an outsider who can bring change to @entity13 , " longtime @entity13 observer @entity48 said on @entity49			1
@entity3 's victory falls in line with the signal the @entity13 people have been sending for a while , said @entity60 , editor and publisher of the @entity63 - based newspaper @entity62			1
" they do n't want the establishment			0
they do n't want the status quo , " he said			0
on the streets of @entity70 , thousands turned out to chant one of his most popular nicknames : " @entity71 , " which means bald head in @entity75			0
@entity13 , especially the youth , were starving for a fresh face			0
and they got it monday when the election council announced preliminary results			0
@entity3 won by a landslide with 67.6 % of the vote , soundly defeating his challenger , former first lady @entity84 , who received 31.5 %			1
@entity60 called @entity3 's campaign impressive			1
he came out of nowhere and stunned established politicians with his strong showing in november			0
" this was a man who could move millions with a microphone , " @entity60 said			0
but at first , the election council said @entity3 had placed third , behind @entity84 and @entity92 , meaning he was not eligible for a runoff			1
his supporters took to the streets , angry at what they said was a rigged election			0
then came a review of the vote , monitored by the @entity100			0
the review resulted in @entity41 's removal from the ballot and placed @entity3 in the runoff			1
it was exactly what the candidate had hoped for back in december when he laid out for @entity0 his plan to lift @entity13 out of its misery			0
@entity3 appeared in jeans and a button - down shirt at his plush home in @entity114 , a suburb of @entity70 up in the hills			1
a silver arm cuff hugged his right wrist and he sipped hard on his favorite ice - cream soda			0
he sat at a table surrounded by a piano and eight wall - mounted speakers			0
it was not hard to tell this was a party house			0
@entity13 , he said then , was on the brink of revolution			0
" this is a very dangerous corner in @entity13 's history , " he said			1
" but it 's a revolution that can be done peacefully through the election			1
" under the father - and - son @entity131 dictatorship , @entity40 lacked freedom , but the people had clean roads , electricity , jobs , security , @entity3 said			1
when democracy came overnight to this @entity141 nation , people did n't know how to handle it			2
@entity3 spoke of 24 years of troubled times , of a poor country that , he said , hurtled backward into even more poverty			1
" we are ruled by corruption , " he said			0
" the people have no confidence in their government			1
" the lack of confidence was further eroded by a presidential election in disarray			1
" you know how ( @entity159 president @entity158 ) @entity157 said it 's not about the man , but it 's about the plan ? " he said			2
" here it 's more about the man than about the plan			2
" @entity13 will go nowhere , he said , unless the people have a president they can trust , a president who is honest			2
he was that man , he insisted			0
he said his background in music as well as social work -- he founded an aid agency that helps the poor -- gave him 22 years on the ground			0
the people know him , he said			2
he was their light at the end of the tunnel			0
but the man also had plans			0
he said , for instance , that the $ 12 billion that was pledged by the international community for earthquake assistance should come in the form of infrastructure , not money , because @entity40 do n't know how to manage money			1
" people are fed up here , " he said			2
" they have no food , no education , no health care			0
what kind of place is it when a young girl will sell her body to buy a phone card ? " @entity3 exuded confidence that he could bring change to @entity13			1
but not everyone is so sure			0
" he 's stepping into not only a complicated moment in @entity13 history but he is also stepping into the wasp 's nest of @entity13 politics , " said @entity199 , author of " the rainy season : @entity13 @entity206			2
" @entity199 said @entity3 is a big unknown -- a pro for voters perhaps but a con for those trying to measure up the next few years of @entity13 history			1
" i do n't see any reason to believe or not to believe he will be good at it , " @entity199 said			0
" i think @entity13 needs a fresh start			0
it needs to step out of the muck			0
" maybe , she said , @entity3 is the man to do just that			1
@entity60 compared @entity3 's win to another victory more than two decades ago that catapulted a @entity222 priest into the presidency			1
@entity224 was popular in his own right as a man of the church but he also rose to power because he was not from the establishment			0
" @entity3 spoke in a way @entity224 spoke to the people , " @entity60 said			1
" he spoke to them , not at them			0
" but look what happened to @entity224 , @entity60 said , referring to the fall of @entity13 's first democratically elected president , who coincidentally returned from exile just days before last month 's election			2
@entity60 drew another comparison as well			0
like @entity224 , @entity3 has no experience in politics			1
" he is a musician and a good one at that , " he said			0
that makes @entity60 a fan of @entity3 but not necessarily a supporter of @entity3 's			1
ultimately , @entity60 said , what does an entertainer know about @entity13 's role in the world			2
some @entity13 observers went further than that			0
@entity252 , a @entity253 lawyer who has studied human rights in @entity13 , said @entity3 hardly had the credentials to run the country and did not see much hope for the immediate future			1
he said his majority vote was skewed because @entity224 's party , @entity260 , was barred from participation			2
" it 's sort of a bad joke , " @entity252 said			2
but criticism does n't deter @entity3			1
when asked in december whether a man who made a name dancing and singing had the mettle for his nation 's top job , he smiled			2
" well , " he said			0
" look at what the politicians have done			0

@entity3 's popularity *escalated* him to a political victory
he vows to restore people 's confidence in government
@entity40 want change , says a newspaper editor
@entity3 's lack of experience makes him a big unknown
