this city 's anti-tech backlash took a new turn sunday when protesters lashed out at @entity5 partner @entity4 , waving banners outside his home while demanding that @entity5 fund " anti-capitalist " communities in the @entity10			1
claiming to represent service workers , the protesters handed out fliers in the city 's @entity15 neighborhood that called @entity17 a " parasite " and blamed him for helping fuel the " tech startup bubble that is destroying @entity21			1
" the episode was the latest in a wave of anti-tech - industry protests that have been picking up steam in this city over the past year			0
protesters complain an influx of highly paid tech workers is driving up rents , forcing out longtime residents and robbing the city of its famously eccentric character			1
most of the anti-tech fervor has focused on big - name companies such as @entity5 and @entity39 and the private bus systems that ferry their employees from the city to various corporate headquarters in @entity43			2
it 's rarer for the protests to target specific people , although in january an unidentified group protested at the @entity49 home of a @entity5 engineer best known for helping develop the company 's self - driving car			1
the 37 - year - old @entity17 is probably best known as the co-founder of @entity54 , the news aggregation site he helped launch in 2004			1
after @entity17 's last startup was acquired by @entity5 , he went to work at @entity5 , where he helps decide which startups the company 's venture - capital arm will invest in			2
the protesters claim such funding encourages too many young , wealthy entrepreneurs to move to the @entity10			2
@entity17 met the protesters head - on by posting an image of their flier to @entity67 and @entity39			2
in a tweet sunday he noted as " odd " their use of @entity5 products , such as @entity73 phones and @entity74 , to tape and share videos of the protests			0
but he also said he agreed with the protesters in part			0
" we need to solve rising rents , keep the @entity21 culture , and crack down on landlords booting folks out , " @entity17 tweeted			0
" @entity21 is such a great place , definitely need to figure out a way to keep the diversity			0
" a local group called @entity89 appears to have claimed responsibility for the protest , posting a lengthy screed about @entity17 on a blog , kevinroseisaterribleperson.wordpress.com			0
the post demands that @entity5 give $ 3 billion to an anarchist organization so it can " create autonomous , anti-capitalist , and anti-racist communities throughout the @entity10 and @entity98			1
" @entity5 has not yet publicly responded to the demand .			0
