@entity0 faces several big issues before beginning its august recess at the end of the week			1
while it appears lawmakers might get to a few things on the to - do list , other matters are likely to be left until they return in september			0
here 's what will and wo n't get done before the end of the week : 1			0
crisis on the border : agencies responsible for dealing with the influx of youth migrants from @entity14 on the southern border could run out of money next month			2
but competing legislative proposals means it 's highly unlikely a resolution will materialize before friday			2
@entity21 @entity20 are looking at a $ 2.7 billion plan to address the border crisis , while @entity25 @entity24 are crafting a measure totaling less than $ 1 billion			1
president @entity27 has asked @entity0 for $ 3.7 billion			1
the major sticking point overall is whether to change a 2008 law to make it easier to deport those streaming across the border from @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
@entity14 leaders to @entity27 : we 're working on it most republicans argue for the change in policy because it can take months or years to determine legal status under current law			1
they want to link any new money to a change in the 2008 law			2
most democrats oppose altering the law , saying doing so could lead to an unfair process that might short - change kids fleeing gangs and violence who want to stay in the @entity54 legally			2
they want any new money to include no change in policy			1
but @entity20 have sent mixed messages			0
@entity27 top administration officials say they are open to addressing the 2008 law , while @entity62 lawmakers and top leaders warn any major revisions are unacceptable			1
poll : border crisis impacts public opinion @entity25 @entity24 are expected as early as monday to unveil details of legislation that would fund border and other related agencies through the end of september			1
they could vote by week 's end			0
speaker @entity74 says he wants the @entity25 to act but it 's unclear if anything can pass			1
a fix for veterans ' health care : @entity80 uncovered troubling stories of delayed care for veterans , some of whom died			0
allegations surfaced of secret waiting lists for patient care , mismanagement , and bonuses for executives who oversaw such dysfunction			0
investigations were launched , the @entity95 secretary resigned , and @entity0 stepped in			1
veterans caught up in the bureaucratic mess who feared retaliation for speaking out prompted @entity0 to fast - track legislation to revise procedures at hospitals and provide more resources to address case backlogs			1
@entity106 chairman @entity105 , a independent who normally sides with @entity20 , and his @entity25 @entity24 counterpart , rep. @entity110 , announced a deal on a $ 17 billion pacage on monday			1
public outrage over the alarming @entity95 shortcomings has lit a fire under @entity0 to ensure a final measure gets to @entity27 before week 's end			1

veterans waiting longer for cancer care the @entity21 is expected to confirm @entity123 , a former ceo of @entity124 and a @entity126 graduate as the next @entity95 secretary as early as tuesday			1
highway fund running on empty : the highway trust fund , which pays for road and bridge repair carried out by the states , is about to run out of money			2
funded by gasoline taxes , the account has been in trouble for years with prices at the pump steadily higher and people driving more fuel efficient cars and trucks			0
the sluggish economy also has cut down on fuel purchases			0
less money going into the trust fund fund means hard choices			0
raising the 18.4 cents per gallon gas tax is a non-starter , especially in an election year			0
so where will the money come from ? @entity0 in the past has diverted billions in general tax revenues to shore up the trust fund , and that is what 's on the table now			2
a short - term @entity25 bill would infuse the trust fund with $ 11 billion in new revenue			1
it is expected to pass the @entity21 this week			0
but that measure just means this emergency will arise again next may , when the balance gets low again			0
without federal money , states will have to curtail -- and shut down , in some cases -- road projects			0
that 's unappealing on both sides of the aisle since construction provides a lot of jobs and fuels economic growth in other ways			0

@entity25 @entity24 vs. @entity27 : the @entity25 is expected later this week to pass a resolution authorizing @entity74 to sue @entity27 for exceeding his executive authority			1
@entity182 are basing the case on @entity27 's decision last year to authorize a one - year delay in the @entity187 requirement that businesses provide health coverage			1
although @entity182 voted to do the same thing , they maintain it 's the job of @entity0 to change the laws , not the president 's " this is also not about me vs. president @entity27			1
this is about future congresses and future presidents			0
there is a conflict between the executive branch and the legislative branch of our government			0
it is the judiciary branch 's role to help resolve it , " @entity74 wrote on monday in a @entity208 opinion piece			0
@entity25 @entity20 are using the case to raise money and make argument that the suit is merely a political move to rally the @entity24 base ahead of the midterms			1
there is a small contingent of @entity25 conservatives who want to impeach @entity27 , but @entity74 has said multiple times that he disagrees with such a step			1
a @entity80 - @entity224 poll released last week shows that nearly two thirds of @entity54 oppose any move to impeach @entity27			2
funding government agencies : the most basic function of @entity0 is its power of the purse			2
it decides annually how much each agency can spend			0
to date , the @entity25 has passed about half of the annual spending bills establishing budgets for these departments for the fiscal year starting october 1			2
but the @entity21 has not voted on one yet			0
unless both pass some type of massive spending bill to cover everything at once before the end of september , there could be another federal shutdown			0
