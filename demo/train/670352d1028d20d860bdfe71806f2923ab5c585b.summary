while immigration reform is stalled in @entity2 , some members are calling on president @entity3 to take the matter into his own hands , urging him to suspend deportations of undocumented immigrants			1
thirty @entity9 members of @entity2 wrote in a letter that he has the authority to pause deportations of undocumented immigrants , urging " the sensible and moral step of stopping deportations			2
" read the letter " in fact , taking a strong step toward granting relief would move us in the direction of where the immigration debate rightfully should start , with the legalization of eleven million men and women who call the @entity26 their home , " the letter states			1
the lawmakers are the most prominent of a growing chorus calling on @entity3 to use his executive authority to exercise " prosecutorial discretion " to suspend deportations of undocumented immigrants			1
the issue catapulted to prominence last week when an audience member , @entity36 , shouted at the president during an event in @entity39 , demanding that he stop deportations			2
the president immediately rejected @entity36 's demand , saying he does n't have the authority			0
now , some members of @entity2 say he does			0
@entity3 said he ca n't stop deportations of immigrants , but maybe he can " mr. president , you do have the power to stop what 's going on , " rep. @entity47 , @entity49 - @entity48 , said at a news conference on thursday			1
in their letter , the members point to executive action in 201,2 when @entity3 exercised his discretion to suspend deportations of children of undocumented immigrants , known as @entity62			1
" please , mr. president , do something , " said rep. @entity63 , @entity64			0
" we need you to take the kinds of positive action to help our families			0
" although @entity3 has used his discretion to save some from deportation , he has aggressively expanded the program			2
he has expelled more people than any other president : for instance , 410,000 people were deported in 2012 , compared with 116,000 in 2001			0
in their letter , the lawmakers say that 1,100 people are deported every day			0
@entity3 has shifted the type of immigrants targeted for deportation			2
while the administration of president @entity84 targeted working immigrants by raiding workplaces , @entity3 is focusing on convicted criminals and " egregious " immigration violators , including recent border - crossers and illegal re-entrants			1
@entity91 says its efforts are effective , pointing out that 55 % of people deported last year were convicted criminals			0
" criminalizing @entity26 families or giving local law enforcement the responsibility to choose who stays and who goes is not the right option , " the letter reads			0
4 ways immigration reform could still happen - or not the @entity103 passed comprehensive immigration reform this year , including a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the @entity26			1
the legislation has been stalled in the @entity109 and is unlikely to be taken up before the end of the year .			1
