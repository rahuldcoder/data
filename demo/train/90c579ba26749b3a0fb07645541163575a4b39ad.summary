@entity0 -- they 've been called " bromances " : those buddy films and tv shows , such as the movies " @entity10 " and " the 40 - year - old @entity11 , " that feature non-sexual but deep friendships between two or more males			2
@entity14 and @entity15 star in " @entity16 , " which opens friday			1
the forthcoming " @entity16 , " which opens friday , appears to fit the bill			1
in the film , @entity15 plays a man who needs a best man for his wedding but has never made any male friends			1
enter @entity14 as @entity25 , whom @entity15 's character , @entity26 , pursues on several " man - dates " that end up threatening his relationship with his fiancée ( @entity30 )			1
but do n't call the film a " bromance " in the presence of @entity15 and @entity14			1
" we hate that word , " @entity14 told @entity1			1
" it was not part of the lexicon while we were filming , " added @entity15			1
still , both actors have plenty of experience in the , uh , guy - pal genre			2
@entity15 has been in several comedies written , directed or produced by @entity44 , considered one of the leaders of the " bromance " trend with his softer , more openly emotional male characters			1
@entity14 has also been in @entity44 projects -- including last year 's " @entity52 " -- and he stars in the tv series " @entity57 , " which finds plenty of humor in male bonding			1
@entity14 observes that what helps the films work is the discomfort of two men trying to talk about their emotions while hoping to maintain a dispassionate , hard - edged , prototypically manly façade			1
and he knows he 's good at bringing out that discomfort in his co-stars			2
" @entity44 told me that my special skill was that i am able to maintain my likability while getting incredibly close to the creepy line , and that 's what i should try to cultivate , " he said			0
" that 's what he does , " @entity15 noted			1
" he just holds [ the moment ] a little too long			0
" " it 's the fraction of a second too long that makes people uncomfortable , " @entity14 added			1
in " @entity16 , " @entity14 's character is rougher and looser than his characters in " @entity52 " and " @entity57			1
" he welcomed the change			0
" it was a real treat for me , to be honest for a minute , to play this character , because i 've played sort of a puppy dog guy in ' @entity52 , ' and on [ ' mother ' ] i play a husband , you know , a loving husband , " he said			0
" so to get to play a character who is a bit more of a man of mystery was very exciting for me			0
" in real life , claims @entity14 , he even has a man cave			1
" it 's filled with puppets , " he said			0
" and i keep wondering why i do n't have a girlfriend			0
i 'm like , ' hey , this is my house ; come check it out			0
this is where i keep my 40 puppets			0
' ... i think that i have a reputation for being weird because of that			0
" but he quickly turns serious and maintains that " @entity16 " does have a message to go along with its comedy			1
" i think we both had something to learn from each other , " he said			0
" @entity15 's character had to learn that it 's all right to take a little distance from your significant other and have some dude friends and someone to vent to about things you ca n't necessarily talk about with your girl			2
" " sometimes buddies hold a mirror up to the way you behave in ways that relationships with the opposite sex do n't , " @entity15 said			2
" yeah , and my character had to learn that maybe it 's time to grow up a little bit , " @entity14 added			2
so , this " bromance " thing , allowing a few feelings to show			2
perhaps it 's not so bad after all ? @entity15 says that the idea has its upside , despite its name			2
and he 's glad it 's been successful			0
" that 's us in a nutshell , not macho , not tough , " he said			0
" i think that we 've all been kind of drawn to real stories , you know , characters that hopefully people can relate to and what 's funny about just certain insecurites and just certain things in life			0
" they could easily be dramatic , " he pointed out			0
" just less fart jokes			0

" @entity16 " stars @entity15 , @entity14 as two men trying friendship
neither @entity15 nor @entity14 likes the term " bromance "
comedy makes some serious points about friendship , @entity14 says
