@entity0 , @entity1 -- to the unaccustomed eye , a man toting 120 books while riding a stubborn donkey would seem nothing short of a circus spectacle			1
but for hundreds of children in the rural villages of @entity1 , @entity9 is far from a clown			1
he is a man with a mission to save rural children from illiteracy			1
" there was a time when many people thought that i was going crazy , " said @entity9 , a native of @entity16 , @entity1			1
" they 'd yell , ' carnival season is over			2
' ... now i 've overcome that			0
" @entity9 , 38 , is a primary school teacher who spends his free time operating a " biblioburro , " a mobile library on donkeys that offers reading education for hundreds of children living in what he describes as " abandoned regions " in the @entity1 state of @entity0			1
" in [ rural ] regions , a child must walk or ride a donkey for up to 40 minutes to reach the closest schools , " @entity9 said			1
" the children have very few opportunities to go to secondary school			1
... there are [ few ] teachers that would like to teach in the countryside			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2010 @entity47 at the start of his 17 - year teaching career , @entity9 realized that some students were having difficulty not just learning , but finishing their homework assignments			1
most of the students falling behind lived in rural villages , where illiterate parents and lack of access to books prevented them from completing their studies			2
to help bridge the learning gap , @entity9 decided to personally bring books to the children			1
" i saw two unemployed donkeys at home and had the idea [ to use ] them in my biblioburro project because they can carry a heavy load , " @entity9 said			2
" i put the books on their backs in saddles and they became my work tools			0
" every wednesday at dusk and every saturday at dawn , @entity9 leaves his wife and three young children to travel to select villages -- up to four hours each way -- aboard a donkey named @entity82			2
a second donkey , @entity84 , follows behind , toting additional books and a sitting blanket			0
they visit 15 villages on a rotating basis			0
" it 's not easy to travel through the valleys , " @entity9 said			0
" you sit on a donkey for five or eight hours , you get very tired			0
it 's a satisfaction to arrive to your destination			0
" at each village , some 40 - 50 youngsters await their chance to get homework help , learn to read or listen to any variety of tall tales , adventure stories and geography lessons @entity9 has prepared			1
" you can just see that the kids are excited when they see the biblioburro coming this way			0
it makes them happy that he continues to come , " said @entity108 , 34 , whose two children take part in the program			1
" for us , his program complements what the children learn in school			1
the books they do not have access to ... they get from the biblioburro			0
" more than 4,000 youngsters have benefited from @entity9 's program since it began in 1990			1
@entity9 says countless others have been helped , too ; parents and other adult learners often participate in the lessons			2
@entity9 has spent nearly 4,000 hours riding his donkeys , and he 's not traveled unscathed			1
in july 2008 , he fractured his leg when he fell from one of the donkeys ; in 2006 , he was pounced on by bandits at a river crossing and tied to a tree when they found out he had no money			2
despite these injuries , which left him with a limp , @entity9 has no intention of slowing down			0
in addition to the biblioburro program , he and his wife built the largest free library in @entity0 next to their home			1
the library has 4,200 books , most of which are donated -- some from as far away as @entity152			2
they also run a small community restaurant			0
@entity9 's hope is that people will understand the power of reading and that communities can improve from being exposed to books and diverse ideas			0
" for us teachers , it 's an educational triumph , and for the parents [ it 's ] a great satisfaction when a child learns how to read			2
that 's how a community changes and the child becomes a good citizen and a useful person , " @entity9 said			0
" literature is how we connect them with the world			0
" want to get involved ? check out @entity9 's website at @entity175 and see how to help .			0
