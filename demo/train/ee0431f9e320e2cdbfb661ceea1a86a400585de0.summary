-- @entity1 , the former @entity2 commander who went on trial wednesday for crimes against humanity , is a notorious name synonymous with the dissolution of @entity8 , the @entity10 wars of the 1990s and the bloody assaults on @entity12 and @entity13			1
during the five - day orgy of slaughter at @entity13 , which @entity1 is accused of being directly involved in , up to 8,000 @entity14 were exterminated in what was described by the @entity19 war crimes tribunal as " the triumph of evil			1
" a judge at the @entity24 tribunal described what happened there in july 1995 as " truly scenes from hell written on the darkest pages of human history			0
" born in @entity32 , @entity33 , during the height of @entity35 , the 70 - year - old was a career soldier who served in @entity8 's military before that nation dissolved in the early 1990s			1
@entity1 was shaped by the war when his father was killed by @entity40 when he was two years old			1
in 1965 he graduated from a military academy and joined the @entity42 in @entity8 , an ethnic stew of six states -- @entity33 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , and @entity49			1
over the following three decades he rose rapidly through the ranks of the @entity52 army			2
by the time he took @entity33 's battlefields he had become a hero to many @entity55 , seen as defender of their dwindling fortunes			1
. in may 1992 , @entity33 's @entity45 political leaders picked him to head their forces and lead the assault on their enemies			1
@entity33 's @entity14 leaders wanted independence while the @entity55 wanted to remain part of @entity8 -- and the ethnic majority			1
@entity1 wasted no time galvanizing his heavily armed forces to besiege @entity12 , cutting the city off from the outside world by shelling and sniping at its poorly prepared civilian population in the valley below them			1
more than 10,000 people , most of them civilians , were killed			0
over the course of the three - year war that raged across the whole country more than a quarter million people died , making the conflict the bloodiest in @entity81 since @entity35 a @entity83 policeman who collected evidence from @entity85 , @entity86 - @entity82 , told the @entity24 tribunal in 1996 that @entity89 forces killed and tortured refugees in @entity13 at will			1
streets were littered with corpses , he said , and rivers were red with blood			0
many people committed suicide to avoid having their noses , lips and ears chopped off , he said			0
among other lurid accounts of mass murder , @entity82 cited cases of adults being forced to kill their children or watching as soldiers ended the young lives			0
" one soldier approached a woman in the middle of a crowd , " he said			0
" her child was crying			0
the soldier asked why the child was crying and she explained that he was hungry			0
the soldier made a comment like , ' he wo n't be hungry anymore			0
' he slit the child 's throat in front of everybody			0
" as the war ended in the fall of 1995 , @entity1 went on the run			1
over the years , he eluded authorities while his cohort , @entity125 , was apprehended and is facing various charges at the court in the @entity24			2
their mentor , former @entity45 president @entity128 , died in jail in 2006 during his trial at the @entity24			2
eventually , more than 16 years later , he was captured an hour 's drive from the @entity45 capital living on a farm with a cousin			0
world leaders and human rights groups described the arrest as " historic " and " an important step forward			0
" key dates in hunt for @entity1 @entity19 @entity142 ban ki - moon called it a " historic day for international justice			2
this arrest marks an important step in our collective fight against impunity			0
" @entity150 called @entity1 " @entity81 's most wanted war crimes suspect " while @entity152 's law chief @entity151 said " at last the people who suffered have hope he will be brought to justice			1
" the arrest meant a major hurdle that once stood between @entity45 and its long - awaited entrance into the @entity163 was overcome , but the trial could also usher in political backlash from the country 's electorate , some of whom consider @entity1 a hero			1
speaking to a @entity171 demonstration outside @entity173 's parliament building immediate after the arrest , @entity169 described his father as " a freedom fighter			0
" the elder @entity1 " defended his own nation , defended his people , which was his job , " his son said			2
@entity181 : @entity33 's future is tied to justice his family and lawyer have tried to use his poor health to prevent his extradition to the @entity189 on the @entity8 in the @entity190 , but they failed			2
in the court room at @entity24 last year @entity1 appeared to have lost none of his visceral dislike of his enemies			2
@entity0 's @entity181 said he saw the defendant drawing his finger across his throat , " a gesture aimed directly at at some of the @entity13 widows sitting in front of me , whose husbands he is accused of killing			1
