-- the governor of @entity2 , @entity1 , says it is " hard to believe " another monster tornado could devastate the @entity6 suburb of @entity7			1
the odds of one striking the same place twice are extremely rare -- rarer still if it 's near a populated area			2
but if that place is @entity7 , science may offer an explanation			2
" @entity2 has one of the highest climatological likelihoods for tornadoes of any place in the nation , " according to @entity21 of the @entity22			1
" so if two @entity24 / @entity24 tornadoes are going to strike the same city within 15 years , @entity7 is as likely as any other place			2
even so , this is an extremely rare occurrence , " @entity21 said			0
on average , 10 tornadoes a year reach the most dangerous classification and almost never strike populated areas			1
monday 's deadly storm was the exception			1
@entity6 area hammered by @entity24 tornado in 1999 moreover , it partly followed the path of an @entity24 tornado that walloped metro @entity6 in 1999 , killing three dozen people			0
that twister tracked a path that included @entity7 , a southern suburb of more than 50,000 people			2
it was one of the costliest tornadoes in @entity46 history			0
@entity48 - @entity47 , @entity49 and @entity50 are also considered high risk for severe tornadoes , according to @entity53 of the @entity55 's @entity54 in @entity56 , @entity2			1
deadliest tornadoes on record yet , none of those metro areas has been through what @entity7 has experienced			2
monday 's storm caused enormous property destruction and killed at least two dozen people			1
" yet it was a relatively ordinary violent tornado , " according to @entity53 , an acknowledged expert on the climatology and probability of twisters			0
tornado prediction is improving such twisters are defined as those that have winds of at least 200 mph , are a half - a - mile or more wide , and produce the most fatalities			1
when they touch down , they normally stay on the ground for 30 to 60 minutes			0
the @entity78 said monday 's tornado was 1.3 miles wide as it tore through @entity7			1
the estimated peak winds ranged from 200 to 210 mph -- which would make it an @entity24 , the most powerful category			1
judging by the vast destruction of homes and buildings , experts say it was on the ground for about 40 minutes			0
the number of tornadoes overall seems to be more variable			0
" in the last three years we have set records for the most tornadoes in 12 consecutive months and the least number of tornadoes in 12 consecutive months , " @entity53 said			0
he has no explanation for the inconsistency			0
@entity24 tornadoes are terrifying perfect storms			0

@entity7 hit by devastating twisters twice since 1999
the *biggest* tornadoes usually do *n't* strike populated areas
@entity2 has one of the highest climates
estimated peak winds in monday 's deadly storm were between 200 - 210 mph
