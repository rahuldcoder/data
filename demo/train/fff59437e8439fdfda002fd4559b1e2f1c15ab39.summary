-- it was once the place @entity2 flocked to when leaving for pastures new			1
now , the site of the old @entity5 in the south of @entity7 could be set to bring in billions of dollars worth of international investment to the debt - stricken nation			1
the @entity2 government hopes the sale of its stake in @entity14 ( the operating company established in 2011 to develop the property ) to a private investor will help ease its financial difficulties as well as lead to the development of thousands of new homes , leisure facilities and commercial space			1
@entity2 is in the process of shedding state - owned assets as dictated by the conditions of its @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 bailout			1

when the @entity41 came to @entity7 , a section of @entity14 was redeveloped so it could host five of the @entity44 ' events			1
new venues were constructed for baseball , softball , canoeing , kayaking and field hockey			0
yet the stadiums and the vast majority of the site have lain dormant ever since , a barren wasteland testament to a lack of legacy planning			2
today , weeds grow where sporting champions were once crowned and stray dogs roam where hulking jumbo jets took - off			0
the @entity63 ( @entity64 ) hope a buyer for the site will be announced in the coming weeks after the number of bidders was whittled down to three from an original nine last year			0
the final bidders are @entity72 developer @entity70 , @entity7 - based @entity73 and @entity75 firm @entity74 , @entity64 ceo @entity76 confirmed to @entity0			2
each will likely have their own visions for the site but if sale and development proceeds as planned , @entity14 could quickly become one of @entity84 's largest construction projects , covering an area roughly twice as big as @entity87 's @entity86			1

an alternative plan some believe there are more effective ways to make @entity14 productive for both public and private sector in the long term			2
urban planner and former ceo of @entity14 , @entity102 , told @entity0 that putting all 64 million square foot up for sale in one go is too much for one developer to digest			2
he suggests spreading the risk and selling to numerous separate investors instead and developing the site in phases			2
others , meanwhile , fret about what the larger issue of selling off state assets will do to @entity2 in the medium to long term			1
the privatization drive has so far failed to bring in the amounts advocates of the process had previously advertised			0

an @entity132 - @entity131 consortium agreed to pay $ 660 million to purchase the @entity2 state 's share in the resort			1
the sum invested represents 200 times the @entity129 's earnings of just over $ 3 million last year			0
according to @entity138 , one of the bankers who put the @entity129 sale together , credit for the transaction has to go to the incumbent administration of prime minister , @entity144			0
" the government is making every effort to cut red tape , " @entity138 said			0
" the prime minister said we used to have red tape for international investors now we have red carpet			0
i think this ( deal ) is the first manifestation of this			0
" many in @entity2 feeling the harsh effects of austerity , rising political extremism on the right and left as well as a high unemployment rate ( which at 28 % is the highest in @entity84 , according to @entity162 ) will disagree with the positivity of this analysis			0
whether the @entity14 sale goes to plan and brings in as much income as expected , however , will help determine whether @entity2 's long term privatization plans are on track or if claims the country is selling the family jewels for less than their true worth are justified .			1
