let 's face it -- it does n't take much to convince us to do ridiculous things , document them and share them on the @entity7			1
make it for a good cause , and you get a viral sensation that starts with a single person and rides the wave of social media all the way to @entity16 , the @entity17 and sports stadiums around the world			1
the @entity20 is a social media campaign that aims to raise awareness and money to fight @entity25 's disease , also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or @entity27			1
and it 's simple , in the same way that laying stiff as a board in weird places or dancing the " @entity32 " is simple			1
dump a bucket of ice - cold water over your head , then challenge a friend , or friends , to either do the same or donate money to the @entity40			0
make a video of the whole thing and post it to your social media accounts			1
voila ! you 've completed the # @entity45			0
and while most viral web trends tend to crop up , then disappear without accomplishing much other than providing a few chuckles , the @entity20 is making a difference			1
the @entity40 reports that it , and its 38 chapters , received $ 4 million in donations in just two weeks			0
last year during that same time period , july 29 - august 12 , the association brought in $ 1.1 million			0
" we have never seen anything like this in the history of the disease , " said @entity52 , president and ceo of @entity40 , in a news release			2
" we could n't be more thrilled with the level of compassion , generosity and sense of humor that people are exhibiting as they take part in this impactful viral initiative			2
" it all started with @entity69 , a former baseball player at @entity70 who has been living with @entity27 since 2012			1
he floated the idea and his former teammates , as well as other @entity74 - area athletes , took him up on it			2
it was noticed and covered by local media and that attention , along with the social web 's viral nature , launched it onto a much larger stage			1
athletes , celebrities and politicians , as well as everyday folks , have gotten in on the act			1
for example , @entity91 quarterback @entity90 , himself a @entity70 alum , took the challenge last week , then challenged his wide receiver corps -- @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 -- to do the same			2
so far , @entity97 and @entity95 have taken him up on it , with @entity97 passing the challenge along to @entity101 star @entity100 and @entity95 challenging fellow @entity104 players @entity102 , @entity105 and @entity106			0
( of course for the @entity91 , who are currently being profiled on @entity111 's documentary series " @entity112 , " a bucket of ice water might not have seemed so bad during training camp in the @entity116 heat )			2
and leave it to a hockey player to try to show he 's tougher than everybody else			1
@entity121 player @entity120 , most recently of the @entity122 , posted a @entity124 video of himself in his underwear , having frigid glacier water dumped on him by a helicopter			2
he , too , called out @entity100 , as well as @entity104 quarterbacks @entity128 and @entity130			0
@entity131 , @entity132 , and @entity133 are among the celebrities who have gotten wet for the cause			2
even broadcasting legend and former @entity138 host @entity137 joined in -- well , kind of			0
@entity137 made one of his producers take the icy plunge			0
in the world of politics , the @entity74 area 's most famous family , the @entity144 , joined in a big way			2
more than 20 members dumped buckets of ice water on their heads then challenged " @entity152 " -- the 86 - year - old family matriarch and widow of sen. @entity154 -- who did so after challenging president @entity156 himself			1
@entity156 declined the opportunity to dump ice water on himself on camera			1
but he 'll be making a donation to the cause			0
" the president appreciates mrs. @entity166 thinking of him for the challenge -- though his contribution to this effort will be monetary , " principal deputy white house press secretary @entity163 said tuesday			0
of course , many of the folks who take the challenge also donate , which accounts in part for the big numbers for the @entity40			0
but the very act of making the cause viral has been hugely important , too			0
" while the monetary donations are absolutely incredible , " said @entity52 , " the visibility that this disease is getting as a result of the challenge is truly invaluable			0
people who have never before heard of @entity27 are now engaged in the fight to find treatments and a cure for @entity27			1
" currently , there is only one @entity189 - approved drug for @entity27 and that one only extends survival by several months , according to the @entity40			1
people with the disease lose control of muscle movement , eventually losing their ability to eat , speak , walk and , ultimately , breathe			0
