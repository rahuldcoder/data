-- as a practicing @entity5 all my life , my faith and the church are never far from my mind			0
the lessons i learned in the church have structured the way i 've approached my life and my career			0
they were lessons of grace , kindness , forgiveness and compassion			0
under @entity17 , we have seen a change at the @entity19 that is reflective of the church i know and love			1
he approaches controversial doctrine or past wrongdoing with humility , understanding and faith in the goodness of mankind			2
he has served as a voice for the voiceless , and has been working to re-establish the church as a home for the homeless			0
the church is moving into a new era , where its leadership understands that what makes the church strongest is when it acknowledges , in @entity17 ' words , " we all make mistakes and we need to recognize our weaknesses			1
" the true potential that this new era holds is pope @entity17 ' embrace of the lesson that how we forgive those mistakes and how we grow from those weaknesses is what defines us , and defines our faith			1
pope @entity17 himself recently acknowledged that the church must grow and change , including in how it trains its clergy , lest the church find itself â € ” these are his words -- " creating little monsters			1
" recently , i saw " @entity58 , " a film that i believe illustrates the need for this new era , and the potential that it holds			1
@entity58 's story is a difficult one			1
she became pregnant out of wedlock at a young age and was taken in by nuns in @entity69 who arranged for her son to be adopted by an @entity73 family			0
while she worked hard to pay her keep , she was only permitted to see him one hour a day			0
then , at age 3 , he was gone -- adopted by an @entity73 family in an arrangement made by the nuns without @entity58 's input			1
@entity58 was treated harshly by some of the nuns in whose charge she was left , the same ones who ensured she would never see her son againâ € ” though she never stopped loving him			2
the argument made by some of the film 's detractors is that the painful , yet accurate , portrayal of the nuns @entity58 encountered is evidence that the film , its producers , and even @entity94 herself have an @entity97 bias and worse -- a vendetta against the @entity99 and a political agenda			1
these nuns who kept @entity58 from her son may very well have been examples of the " little monsters " that pope @entity17 fears			1
i viewed the film quite differently from these critics -- and instead saw in it the positive attributes of my @entity5 upbringing , attributes that are increasingly at the forefront of religious discussion			2
quite simply , i believe the lessons found in @entity58 's story are lessons that many of us hope to be the cornerstone of a new era of @entity5 under @entity17			1
at the heart of the film is not only @entity58 's journey to find her son , but also her journey to find forgiveness for the individuals who treated her with such cruelty , and the church that allowed them to do so			1
@entity129 , like @entity58 , am a lifelong @entity5 , and still regularly attend church			2
my faith is important to me , i love the church and believe it is an important force for good , both here in @entity73 and throughout the world			0
but that does n't mean i do n't have disagreements with some of its policies or leaders			0
on occasion , with issues such as same - sex marriage and contraception , i have found myself at odds with pieces of traditional church doctrine			0
but to be religious is not to never question or disagree			0
to love my church is to be able to question it when it does wrong , forgive it for its mistakes , and still have faith in it to do right			1
in @entity17 , i see a leader who lives every day in the image of @entity158			2
under his guidance , the church is focused once again on providing comfort , compassion and salvation for sinners , the poor and those who seek peace in an increasingly complex world			0
that 's @entity58 's @entity5			2
that 's the @entity5 of millions who believe , even when they disagree			0
it 's not anti-catholic to question , nor is it anti-catholic to be honest about the previous shortcomings of the church , because that is the only way we can ensure its strength and dignity moving forward			1
it is , however , very catholic to forgive each other , and to never stop loving each other			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			0

@entity187 : pope @entity17 has *reoriented* the church to stress humility , forgiveness
she says critics who say the new film " @entity58 " is anti-catholic are wrong
film tells story of woman 's effort to forgive *people* who treated her cruelly , she says
@entity187 : it 's not anti-catholic to question or to talk about failings of the past
