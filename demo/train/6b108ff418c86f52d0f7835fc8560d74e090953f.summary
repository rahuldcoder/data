while winter is a distant memory for most @entity3 , it continues unabated in @entity4 , @entity5 -- where a new bout of precipitation this weekend helped the city break its record for seasonal snowfall , at more than 133 inches ( 3.38 meters )			1
some 3.4 inches of snow -- and counting -- had fallen as of 4 p.m. ( 8 p.m. et ) saturday in @entity4 , according to the @entity12			2
that brought the seasonal total for the city to 133.6 inches -- breaking the record of 132.6 inches , set in 1954 - 1955			2
and with snow continuing to fall into early sunday morning , the figure promises to get even larger			0
" okay ... now the records broken , could you please make the snow go away ? ? ! ! " wrote one commenter of the @entity20 page of the weather service 's @entity5 division			0
another said , " oh , it 's not chilly			0
i 'm wearing a tee - shirt and shorts while cooking outside and enjoying this beautiful springtime weather @ 35 degrees			0
" while snow is nothing new to @entity5 , this year 's record haul in @entity4 is notable given that the average seasonal snowfall is 74.5 inches			1
and it 's also striking considering that , elsewhere in the @entity3 , this past winter was known more for its warmth than its white stuff			0
across the @entity3 , the 2011 - 2012 winter season was the fourth warmest ever recorded , according to the @entity40			1
the agency 's report , issued in march , found that a relative dearth of snow throughout the contiguous @entity3 contributed to snow cover levels in @entity46 being the fourth lowest since such records were first kept			1
still , as much as @entity4 residents can revel in being standouts when it comes to snow in their country , they hardly merit top billing in their own state			0
other record - setters in the state include @entity57 , a community about 92 miles north of @entity59 that saw about 360 inches of snow for the 2011 - 2012 season -- smashing the previous record of 309 inches set five years ago , according to the weather service .			1

@entity4 has had more than 133 inches of snow for the 2011 - 2012 season
this breaks the previous snowfall record for a season , set 57 years ago
the @entity3 overall saw less snow , with the 4th least snow cover recorded
