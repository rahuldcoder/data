@entity0 -- @entity3 officials have accused the @entity5 government of bizarre plots over the years , such as trying to kill @entity7 with exploding cigars			1
on wednesday , they said @entity9 is using a new weapon against the island : spam			0
" it 's overloading the networks , which creates bad service and affects our customers , " said @entity13 , chief of security operations at the @entity3 government - run telecommunications company @entity15			1
at a news conference wednesday , @entity3 officials said text messaging platforms run by the @entity5 government threatened to overwhelm @entity3 's creaky communications system and violated international conventions against junk messages			1
the spam , officials say , comes in the form of a barrage of unwanted text messages , some political in nature			0
@entity35 said that during a 2009 concert in @entity0 performed by the @entity39 pop star @entity38 , a @entity5 government program blanketed @entity3 cell phone networks with around 300,000 text messages over about five hours			1
" it was a platform created to attack @entity3 networks , " @entity35 said			1
as first reported by @entity45 last week , the @entity44 created a cell phone - based " @entity48 " program , known as @entity48			1
it allowed @entity5 government officials to send blast texts to @entity3 and allowed people on the island to message each other independent of @entity3 government restrictions on communications			1
under @entity3 law , all internet and communications services on the island are controlled by government - run entities			1
@entity44 officials envisioned the program being used to organize " smart mobs " that could challenge the @entity3 government 's control on power , according to documents obtained by the @entity45 @entity5 defends ' discreet ' program just this month , @entity3 started a government e-mail service that allows people to receive e-mails on their phones			1
in the country , which has the lowest rate of internet access in the @entity80 , the vast majority of people communicate via text message rather than using e-mail			0
@entity48 -- @entity3 slang for erratic , zigzag movements -- counted around 68,000 users at the height of the program 's popularity , @entity44 said			1
the program ended in 2012 after @entity5 government funds for it dried up			2
@entity3 officials have blasted the program as part of a long - running campaign by @entity9 to destabilize the island 's single - party communist government and said other similar mass - messaging programs still exist			1
@entity5 government officials have defended the program , saying they were trying to foster free expression in @entity3			1
last week , @entity102 spokeswoman @entity101 denied accusations that the program aimed to push a particular political agenda			1
" we believe that the @entity3 people need platforms like this to use themselves to decide what their future will look like , and that 's certainly what we did here , " she told reporters			2
" we were trying to expand the space for @entity3 to express themselves			2
they could 've expressed ... anti-american views on it			0
we did n't monitor or ... choose what they say on these platforms			0
that 's up to them			0
" but other @entity5 officials have been less positive about the program 's value			1
during a @entity44 budget hearing tuesday , @entity5 sen. @entity128 , @entity129 , called @entity48 " a cockamamie idea " that the @entity3 government had little difficulty tracing back to the @entity5			1
@entity44 administrator @entity134 said that @entity48 had been carried out " discreetly " to avoid @entity3 government detection , but it was n't a covert program that would have required congressional approval			1
" creating platforms to improve communication in @entity3 and in many parts of the world is a core part of what @entity44 has done for some time and continues to do , " @entity134 said			2
" our administration 's policy is to continue to support efforts to allow for open communications			0
" @entity134 said that @entity44 " continues to support platforms " like @entity48 , but he did n't go into details			2
@entity154 ' attorney : program is ' shocking ' attempts by @entity44 employees and contractors to get @entity5 government technology into the hands of @entity3 has been at the heart of a high - profile case that 's been a flashpoint in @entity3 - @entity5 relations in recent years			1
former @entity44 subcontractor @entity154 is serving a 15 - year sentence in prison on the island after his 2009 arrest for importing banned communications as part of a @entity44 program to connect @entity3 to the @entity172			1
he was charged by a @entity3 court in 2011 of being an @entity5 spy			1
@entity44 has said he was in the country working on a @entity5 government project setting up satellite internet connections			2
@entity134 said the @entity5 government continues to push @entity3 officials to release @entity154			1
but @entity154 , 65 , announced tuesday that he had begun a hunger strike on april 3 from his cell at a @entity3 military hospital to protest the way both countries ' governments are treating him			2
his lawyer said he was shocked to learn about the @entity48 program			2
" once @entity154 was arrested , it is shocking that @entity44 would imperil his safety even further by running a covert operation in @entity3 , " attorney @entity188 said in a statement			2
@entity154 has lost 10 pounds since beginning the hunger strike , a spokeswoman for his attorney said tuesday			0
a statement issued wednesday by @entity3 's @entity197 expressed " concern " about news of @entity154 ' hunger strike but said he " was in good physical condition and his health was normal and stable			2
" @entity3 government officials have offered to discuss trading gross for three @entity3 intelligence operatives serving lengthy prison in the @entity5			1
but @entity5 officials have said that there will be no swap , saying @entity154 was not spying in @entity3			1
former @entity3 counterintelligence official weighs in a former member of @entity3 's secretive state security unit , which hunts what @entity3 officials perceive to be internal threats , said he was n't surprised to hear about the @entity5 - funded @entity48 program			1
it 's just the sort of thing that @entity220 says he was tasked with stamping out when he worked as a counterintelligence official			0
" my job was to discover and neutralize these plans against my country , " said @entity222 , who 's also a cardiologist and a top official in @entity3 's @entity225 community			2
stretching back centuries , the @entity225 describe themselves as one the world 's oldest and largest charitable and fraternal organizations			0
the organization has offices , or " lodges , " across @entity3 and counts important @entity3 historical figures like revolutionary @entity235 among its members			0
in 2004 , @entity222 says he came face to face with @entity154			0
" it 's impossible that he did n't know he was carrying out clandestine and illegal activity , " @entity222 said			0
gross , @entity222 said , visited him to deliver camera equipment and money			0
at the time , @entity44 officials and representatives from other @entity5 agencies proposed setting up satellite , internet - based centers at the @entity225 temples that @entity222 oversaw			1
" @entity154 as a person was nice , very friendly , " @entity222 said			0
" he communicated by making gestures because his @entity252 was very limited			0
" what @entity154 did not realize , according to @entity222 , was that @entity222 was a 30 - year veteran of @entity3 's @entity254 and was informing his superiors of the @entity44 contractor 's activities in @entity3			2
in 2007 , a cable signed by the then - head of the @entity5 diplomatic mission in @entity0 described @entity222 as a likely @entity3 government " pawn , " following " instructions from the @entity7 regime to penetrate , weaken , and divide the @entity225 community			1
" the message also said that only 100 members of @entity3 's 25,000 @entity225 had internet access and called the organization 's @entity0 headquarters a " neutral space " where @entity3 could " participate in civil society			0
" @entity5 diplomats in @entity0 , the cable concludes , " and @entity275 - based donors have supported the @entity277 movement in the past and should continue to do so			2
" the cable was among the trove of @entity5 government documents obtained by @entity281 and published in 2010			0
it is unclear if @entity154 was ever warned that by meeting @entity222 , he had crossed paths with a possible @entity3 counterintelligence operative and was now on authorities ' radar			0
in 2009 , @entity154 was arrested as he arrived at a @entity0 airport carrying satellite communications gear			0
according to a @entity3 sentencing document from @entity154 ' trial , he was traveling to the island to begin a project of connecting @entity225 lodges to the @entity172			0
the next time @entity222 saw @entity154 was in a @entity3 courtroom			0
@entity222 testified against @entity154 at his 2011 trial and revealed himself as " @entity296 , " a foot soldier in @entity3 's vast state security apparatus			2
@entity154 was convicted of threatening @entity3 's national security and sentenced to 15 years in prison			0
his cover blown , @entity222 says @entity154 ' arrest was his last case			0
but in an interview with @entity1 , @entity222 said @entity3 's domestic intelligence capabilities make any @entity5 - directed program , from the @entity308 's alleged exploding cigars to @entity44 's " @entity48 , " nearly impossible to keep secret			1
" there are 11 million @entity3 , " @entity222 said			0
" that means there are 11 million people who could be @entity254			0
" @entity1 's @entity314 and @entity315 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 accuses the @entity5 of overloading communications networks
the accusation comes after a report revealed details of a @entity5 - funded " @entity48 "
@entity5 officials defend the program , saying it aimed to foster free *speech* in @entity3
