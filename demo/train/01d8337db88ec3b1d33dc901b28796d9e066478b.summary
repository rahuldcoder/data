-- a lot of us were rooting for @entity3 on monday night			0
given the contentious recent history of the host chair -- @entity6 to @entity7 to @entity6 -- he was standing on a media trapdoor , with critics just waiting to pull the lever			1
early reviews say he not only survived one of the highest - pressure debuts ever -- he killed it			2
if nothing else , a big debut buys you time			2
but does victimless humor -- the kind that does not slice , dice and julienne its subjects -- have legs in a culture that likes its entertainment with a serrated edge ? it 's a question that applies across demographics -- from the prized millennials , who have grown up on the discord of reality television ; to the baby boomers , who are decades into acerbic late night as we know it -- and will have to adjust to bits like slow rolling the news			1
it 's a tough neighborhood , with @entity3 a little like @entity41 walking the streets of a war zone			2
or , as @entity44 jokingly ( but not inaccurately ) said on monday night : " welcome to 11:30 , bitch			0
" one of @entity47 's established competitors , @entity48 , in a recent monologue said that @entity50 met her @entity52 © e when her car broke down and @entity50 " pulls up behind her in her tow truck			1
" ( pause for nervous laughter at the lesbian joke			0
) @entity50 , predictably , was not amused , firing back to @entity58 : " i do n't remember making fun of you when you had sex with all your interns			2
" @entity3 's humor can be topical , but almost always with a softer touch : @entity65 saying she does n't know if she 'll run for president is like him saying " i still do n't know if i 'll have a beer on @entity68			1
" somehow , i do n't think there will be any fights with @entity50			2
and in a broader context , it 's a tough entertainment media in general			0
look no further than reality television , populated by macho slimeballs , back - biting boyfriend stealers and assorted high achievers in the low art of interpersonal nastiness			1
there is a whole new genre allowing us to make fun of rural @entity84			0
no , @entity85 , we 're not laughing with you			0
there is even research that the mean - spirited swamp that is reality tv is starting to seep into the culture in general			1
researchers at @entity92 showed 250 women three scenes : one violent , one frightening and one showing gossip -- including a woman who ostracized a friend			0
all got a response , but the highest mental arousal was category three , which the researchers termed " relational aggression			0
" in other words , watching people be mean to each other may " prime the brain " to be mean ourselves			0
@entity3 's ( we 're all friends just joking around ) humor might be up against something even bigger -- right in his demographic sweet spot			1
a @entity111 of @entity113 study looked at 72 studies of empathy among college students over 30 years			0
they found that empathy -- the ability to identify with others and relate to their feelings -- has dropped an incredible 40 % since 2000			0
among the reasons : the technology - driven isolation , a generational sense of entitlement and social media 's ability to call attention to ourselves			1
also responsible is the winning - is - everything sports culture and huge paydays for those who climb to the top of their fields			1
all told , if there were a sequel today to dr. @entity139 ' classic " i 'm ok , you 're ok " , it might be : " i 'm ok , you 're pathetic			0
" can @entity3 save the world from mean humor ? doubtful ; there is a big market for cynical , biting and demeaning			1
but let 's hope that his first show says there is also room for just plain funny			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			2

@entity153 : critics were waiting to see @entity47 fall on his face , but he scored big
@entity153 : can @entity47 's " nice guy " humor compete with tv 's reality show nastiness ?
she says research shows mean - spiritedness , *inability* to empathize is seeping into culture
@entity153 : @entity47 wo n't reduce nasty humor , but his " just plain funny " style can succeed
