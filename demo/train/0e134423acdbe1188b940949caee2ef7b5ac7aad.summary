@entity3 , @entity2 in a rare order thursday , all seven judges in @entity2 's @entity1 have recused themselves from the lawsuit filed by the parents of @entity8 against the @entity9 and a second action , filed by @entity4 against @entity11			1
the recusals come less than a week before the two - year anniversary of the discovery of @entity8 's body in the center of a rolled gym mat in the old gym at @entity19 on january 11 , 2013			0
@entity8 's parents , @entity21 and @entity22 , said they never believed investigators ' conclusion that their 17 - year - old son died while struggling to reach for a shoe at the center of the mat. they believe their son was murdered			2
months after an autopsy conducted by the state medical examiner supported the local investigators ' conclusion , @entity8 's parents hired a pathologist , who said he found evidence of unexplained , nonaccidental blunt force trauma to @entity8 's neck			1
in june 2013 , attorneys representing @entity21 and @entity22 sued the @entity9 to get access to the department 's full investigative file and a copy of school surveillance video recorded around the time @entity8 disappeared			0
according to the lawsuit , the department 's refusal to release the file was a violation of @entity2 's @entity51			1
chief judge @entity52 ordered the department to release the files and video several days after @entity4 joined the suit in october 2013			1
in november 2014 , @entity4 filed a lawsuit against @entity11 to get access to clones of hard drives containing the original recordings of surveillance video given to sheriff 's investigators			1
the lawsuit also claims the recordings are public record and the school 's refusal to release them constitutes a violation of the state 's @entity51			0
the dispute has not yet been resolved			0
" given the fact that officials with whom the judges in the circuit deal with everyday are involved , it is not fair to the parties for any judge in this circuit to rule on contested matters of importance to the parties and the community , " @entity52 wrote in a letter addressed to attorneys representing all parties			1
only five of the seven judges in @entity2 's @entity1 hear cases regularly			1
two senior judges hear cases only after special assignment			0
" his decision cuts to the very heart of this matter , especially for this family			0
that is : can they get fair and impartial people to look at what happened to this child and render a fair decision so they can have peace at night ? " said @entity8 's attorney , @entity98			0
@entity52 had mediated requests for records in the case for more than 18 months before thursday 's recusal			0
" while i had hoped that at least the preliminary matters would be dealt with through informal mediation , i do not see that happening , " @entity52 wrote			0
" the normal process for case assignment after judicial recusal will result in another judge being assigned to the case following which a hearing will be scheduled to decide the matters now before the @entity122 , " the @entity9 's attorney @entity112 told @entity4 in a written statement			1
an attorney representing @entity11 did not immediately respond to @entity4 's request for comment			2
" @entity2 is a big state			2
i think @entity126 is one of the major cities in @entity129 and i 'm sure there are a lot of judges for them to choose from , not only in @entity126 but throughout the @entity2			1
the hope is that you will find a judge who is as fair and impartial , " @entity98 said			0
@entity4 's @entity136 and @entity137 contributed to this report .			2
