-- former secretary of state @entity1 said tuesday that @entity4 leader @entity3 is using his claims of a successful rocket launch to shore up his political strength within his country			1
former secretary of state @entity1 discusses @entity4 on @entity0 's " @entity9 " on tuesday			1
@entity1 , who was secretary of state in the @entity11 administration , told @entity0 's " @entity9 " that " it was a huge mistake for the @entity13 to stop talking to @entity4 " when the @entity15 administration took over			1
the communist nation launched the rocket over the weekend in defiance of international opposition			0
satellite images released monday appear to show the rocket in flight , according to a nonprofit institution that focuses on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons			2
the following is a transcript of @entity1 's conversation with @entity0 's @entity29			2
@entity29 , @entity0 : we do have this video from @entity4 of this rocket taking off			1
what do you make of that ? former secretary of state @entity1 : well , i think that the @entity4 leadership is living in a parallel universe of acting as if the launch was a success , when tracking and everything has shown that in fact , it is a failure			1
and i think it proves a point , which is that the @entity4 , @entity3 is doing this for his own internal reasons -- because on thursday , tomorrow , there will be a rubber stamp by the parliament of his leadership -- and the problems that he 's generally had since he had his stroke			1
so this is part of their kind of orwellian approach of saying that " this is what happened , and was n't it a success , " when we know it was n't			0
@entity29 : the @entity64 has n't been able to come up with any sort of resolution because apparently that body is split			0
president @entity68 made a really big deal of this and said this was like a clear violation			1
it sort of seems like the @entity13 is stuck , and it ca n't do anything about @entity4			1
@entity1 : well , i do n't think that 's true , because what has happened is there have been individual condemnations by leaders of various countries			2
and i have to say from my own experience of the @entity85 , it does take a while to get the 15 members [ of the @entity64 ] together			0
but the saddest for me is the fact that the @entity85 passed a resolution , 1718 , which said that this was not acceptable			0
so the truth is that the @entity85 has to live up to its own resolutions			0
and ambassador @entity94 , i think , is working very hard up there in order to get some action , but there have been condemnations already throughout the world			0
and the bottom line here is that president @entity68 's speech , for instance , in @entity106 , when he talked about the importance of cooperation generally on a whole nonproliferation regime -- it 's very clear that there 's going to have to be a lot of work on that and that president @entity68 laid out a very , very important set of goals			1
@entity116 : your thoughts on the rocket launch @entity29 : and , you know , there has been some criticism that president @entity68 turned to the @entity85 to try to solve this crisis			1
i want to read you a quote from @entity127			0
it interviewed @entity129 , the former speaker of the house			0
i want to read you his quote			0
@entity129 said , " the embarrassing repudiation of the @entity13 appeal to the @entity85 @entity64 sunday afternoon is a vivid demonstration of weakness			2
this is beginning to resemble the @entity138 administration 's weakness in foreign policy			0
" how would you respond to that ? @entity1 : well , i think that it 's just kind of typical of @entity129 , frankly			2
but the bottom line here is , i think the @entity13 and president @entity68 has made very clear the leadership of the @entity13 , his concern about , generally , proliferation issues			1
i think his trip , for instance , laid out a whole set of issues that prove that @entity13 leadership is essential , the respect that he gained for @entity13 leadership			1
and i think you 're going to see additional ways that we all work together , because the issues that are out there that have to be dealt with require cooperation , and they will require international organizations and cooperation through @entity164 and a number of activities			0
so i 'm very confident that president @entity68 is going to be able to prove @entity13 leadership			1
@entity29 : well , i guess many @entity13 look at it this way , you know : you talk about sanctions , but sanctions have been instituted against @entity4 before , and it has n't really worked			1
@entity4 just seems to kind of do what it wants			2
i mean , what does he want ? @entity1 : well , what he wants is respect			1
and i have to say that part of the problem here is -- and as you mentioned , i met @entity3			2
we were in the middle of negotiations with him			0
in fact , we had a missile moratorium			0
and president @entity15 came in and canceled those talks			2
it was confusing to everybody			0
and i do think that what is important now is to get the @entity4 back into the six - party talks , to make it clear to them that the only way that they are going to have respect is to abide by international regulations and to try to deal with the fact that they would be better off if , in fact , they allowed their people to be fed and an economy that functions , rather than be living in this way where poverty is rampant , and hunger , in every way in @entity4 , and a leadership that is shaky			1
but the bottom line is , i think it was a huge mistake for the @entity13 to stop talking to @entity4			1
and in the interim period , they were able to develop material in order to create nuclear weapons , and so i hope very much that the six - party talks continue			0
@entity29 : we 'll see			0
madam secretary , thanks so much for joining us this morning			0
