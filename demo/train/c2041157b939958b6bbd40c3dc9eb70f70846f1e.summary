-- when an album reaches the top of the @entity4 in its first week , there 's only one direction it can go			0
after making history as the first artists to have their debut album bow at @entity10 , the @entity11 boy band @entity10 ceded the top spot this week to the star - packed " @entity14 " soundtrack			1
dubbed as a " companion " to the @entity18 - led cinematic juggernaut ( most of the songs do n't actually appear in the film ) , the album sold a whopping 175,000 copies , becoming the first theatrical soundtrack to debut atop the chart since @entity24 's " @entity25 " back in 2009			1
of course , the " @entity14 " soundtrack was certainly bolstered by its enviable roster of artists , which includes @entity29 , the @entity30 , and @entity31 -- just to name a few			0
the movie itself grossed $ 155 million in its first weekend			1
so how steeply did @entity10 's " @entity34 " fall ? the album clocked in at no. 4 with 55,000 units moved ( a 69 percent drop from last week 's 175,000 ) -- bested by , yep , @entity38 's " 21 " ( no. 2 , with 130,000 ) and the @entity40 ' " @entity39 " ( which debuted at no. 3 , with 75,000 )			1
rounding out the top five is @entity43 's major - label debut " @entity44 , " selling a hearty 40,000 in its first week			2
as for the rest of the list : @entity48 's " @entity47 " fell to no. 6 with 37,000 ; @entity59 's " the @entity58 " posted a respectable 34,000 in its first week , placing it at no. 7 ; and " now 41 " ( no. 8 , with 31,000 ) , @entity53 's " @entity52 " ( no. 9 , with 29,000 ) , and @entity55 's " @entity54 " ( no. 10 , with 25,000 in its debut week ) round out the rest of this week 's top 10			2
