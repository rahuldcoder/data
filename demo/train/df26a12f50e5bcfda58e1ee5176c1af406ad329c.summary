the luck of the @entity1 had nothing to do with it			1
@entity4 continued their trademark giant killing with the first shock of this cricket @entity8 by defeating @entity9 by four wickets			1
it 's a mere eight years since @entity4 made its tournament debut			1
back in 2007 , they tied with @entity14 and picked up victories over @entity16 and @entity17			0
four years on , there was a famous victory over @entity20 and once more they have picked up the scalp of one of the test - playing nations			2
while @entity4 are on a crest of a wave , the @entity9 are seemingly a team in disarray			1
the once dominant force of global cricket -- @entity9 won two @entity30 in the 1970s with a mixture of fearsome pace bowling and swashbuckling batting -- the current crop of players looked disenchanted on the field throughout the match			2
a pay dispute between the players and the @entity40 led to their tour of @entity42 being abandoned last october and there have reportedly been further rows over the omissions of @entity46 and @entity47 from their @entity8 squad			1
the @entity51 team 's stock has fallen so far that they are now ranked a lowly eighth in the one - day international standings			0
@entity4 captain @entity55 was adamant in the build - up to the game that confidence was high in the camp			1
" i do n't think it 'll be a surprise if we win , " he said			0
" i think we 're preparing for every game and going out there to win that game , and i do n't think it 'll be a surprise to anyone if we go out there and win games			0
" and it was a sentiment backed in the aftermath of another major scalp , @entity55 merely adding : " i do n't see it as an upset			0
" but it was the manner of the victory that was impressive			0
@entity4 were set a target of 305 to win the game , with just four successful run chances above 300 having ever been achieved in @entity8 history			1
now that figure is five and @entity4 are responsible for three of them			2
former @entity20 player @entity81 was the most eye - catching of the @entity1 batsmen with a blistering knock of the 84 runs from 67 balls , while @entity88 top scored 92 and @entity89 finished the innings unbeaten on 79			2
it was left to @entity92 , as he had done famously against @entity20 four years ago , to hit the winning runs and spark the @entity1 celebrations in @entity95 , @entity96			2
rubbing salt into the @entity9 wounds was this was a victory masterminded by a former @entity9 international @entity101 , @entity4 's cricket coach whose nephew @entity103 top scored for the @entity51 side with a century			1
@entity101 ' @entity4 side , though , are not one of the world 's test playing nations , considered to be in the second tier of global cricket at the head of the @entity112			0
but the pre-tournament form of both sides had suggested an upset could be on the cards			0
@entity9 had lost their last one - day international series against @entity118 4 - 1 and managed a meager 122 runs in their @entity8 warm - up match against @entity20			1
in addition , they had lost a @entity123 game to @entity4 in @entity124 just last year			0
when @entity4 broke the mold at the 2007 @entity8 , a documentary called @entity126 followed while their 2011 @entity20 win led the prime minister elect @entity128 to contact the team			1
she said : " their supreme effort will lift the spirits of every single @entity1 person , no matter where they are in the world			0
@entity4 's performance is truly inspiring , demonstrating that , with self - belief , the apparently impossible can be made possible , and that real change can occur			2
" quite what lies in store this time should they continue their giant killing remains to be seen .			0

@entity4 pull - off a *memorable* four - victory against @entity9 in their @entity8 opener
the @entity1 have a history of shock *results* in their brief history in the tournament
@entity9 , meanwhile , are a series in disarray after a series of rows
