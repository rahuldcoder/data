-- move over , @entity1			0
tell those bayou bloodsuckers from " @entity3 " to step aside , too			0
more than 112 years after he first climbed out of the coffin , the world 's most famous vampire is back -- and he 's bloodier than ever			2
" @entity13 , " released this month in the @entity14 , is a sequel to @entity10 's 1897 classic written by @entity11 , the original author 's great - grandnephew			1
the book , co-written by @entity17 historian @entity16 , picks up 25 years after the victorian - era monster is supposedly killed in the original and is based in part on 125 pages of handwritten notes that @entity10 left behind			1
but while many of the original characters are here -- troubled couple @entity23 and @entity27 and vampire hunter @entity28 among them -- the horror has gotten a 21st - century update			2
the sex and violence that @entity10 deftly alluded to in the original are , at times , front and center in his descendant 's sequel			1
" you 've got to keep in mind the perspective , " said @entity11 , a native of @entity39 , @entity40 , now living in @entity41 , @entity42			2
" the degree of sex and violence he had , in this very stuffy and conservative @entity51 society , was cutting edge at the time			0
even the exposure of a woman 's flesh , the piercing of the flesh , was a metaphor for the sex act			0
" and with authors from @entity61 and @entity62 to @entity63 and @entity64 having crafted their own , sometimes lurid , reworkings of the vampire legend , @entity10 said he knew that the new book could n't just be a straight continuation of the first			1
" we 've got to keep up with what other people are doing , " he said			0
" otherwise , our story would be toast			0
" of all the books , movies and other tales to use @entity17 's name throughout the decades , the novel is the first since the 1931 @entity81 movie to have the @entity10 family 's endorsement and input			1
after @entity10 's death , his widow , @entity86 , sold the story 's rights , and eventually , the most iconic character in the history of horror slipped into the public domain			1
@entity11 said that before now , the only thing he 'd ever received for his ancestor 's work was the occasional @entity98 wisecrack			2
" we knew of the legacy of @entity10 , but as kids growing up in @entity39 , it was n't that big a deal , " he said			2
" every now and then at @entity98 you 'd get joked : ' is it safe to come to the @entity10 house ? are we going to get candy or bitten in the neck ? ' " it was a college writing project that revived his interest in his novelist ancestor , a native of @entity113 , @entity114 , who 'd moved to @entity116 , @entity117 , by the time the book was written			1
then , he was contacted by @entity16 in 2003			0
the historian said he wanted to work on a sequel and wanted to have a member of @entity10 's family involved			1
along the way , they uncovered a rare find at the @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity129 : @entity10 's own notes			1
it was n't a plot outline , @entity11 said , " but what i did was find information , characters , little ideas -- plot threads that he had in mind 112 years ago that did n't make it into his story			2
" among the seeds for new plotlines was @entity10 's mention of a police investigator who plays prominently in " @entity13			1
" @entity11 said he 'd always wondered at how the first book was full of murder but no police were involved			2
the notes also prompted the inclusion of @entity151 , whose gruesome exploits gripped @entity116 around the time the elder @entity10 was writing his novel and who is believed by some historians to have helped shape its plot			1
true fans of the vampire genre will find another historical figure they 're likely familiar with gracing the book 's pages and an even more unlikely appearance : @entity10 himself			1
" part of our plan was to paint a realistic picture of @entity10 , " @entity11 said of the author , who spent time as a reporter , theater critic and manager of @entity116 's @entity169			1
not many people know @entity10			2
" response to and reviews of the book have been largely positive			0
" this daring sequel captures the essence and gothic glory of the original , " @entity180 's @entity179 wrote			0
@entity11 , who is touring the @entity14 in support of the release , said he was prepared for the inevitable backlash from pure - blood purists who do n't think the original should be sullied with a follow - up			1
" i have heard just a bit of it , " he said			0
" people say it 's better to leave some of these mysteries alone ; let 's not solve them all			0
believe me , when you read our story , you 'll know we do n't solve them all			0
" and he has some other advice for those diehards : lighten up			0
go with it , " he said			0
" if you do n't want to read it , you do n't have to			0

" @entity13 " written by @entity10 's descendant @entity11
vampire tale is more overtly violent , sexy than the 1897 original
book has prompted good reviews , handful of bitter purists
