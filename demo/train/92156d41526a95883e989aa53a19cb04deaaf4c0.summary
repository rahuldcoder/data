-- the folks at @entity2 and @entity3 must have been wringing their hands on monday when @entity6 ceo @entity5 showed off a new service called @entity8			1
that all - important " one more thing " from @entity6 's software presentation is part of the @entity11 web application and storage suite			1
it was a coup of sorts -- and @entity6 's win over competitors could be attributed to @entity5 ' experience at @entity20 , which he co-founded			1
here 's what @entity6 pulled off : with a free @entity11 account , all songs purchased from @entity24 can be accessed from any @entity6 gadget or computer with @entity24 installed			2
( @entity2 has done something similar with @entity28			0
) for $ 25 a year , @entity24 stores a maximum of 25,000 songs on @entity6 's servers , ready to access from various gizmos			2
and , importantly , @entity6 did this with the blessing of the music industry			1
@entity2 and @entity3 , on the other hand , could n't get the record labels to agree to their terms			2
@entity28 and @entity3 's @entity39 require users to upload every single track to their servers , a process that can take hours or days			0
@entity6 , the largest music retailer , somehow managed to convince the labels and publishers to go along with its plan to use a scan - and - match process			1
@entity8 looks at the user 's music library and grants the keys to high - quality versions of those songs			0
it uses a do n't - ask - do n't - tell policy : @entity54 who ? how did @entity6 pull off something @entity2 and @entity3 could n't , despite them launching cloud - music services first ? for one , @entity6 has a history with the music industry as long as any technology company 's			1
" it 's really hard to get the labels to give you the rights that you need , " @entity5 said in a 2003 interview at the first @entity63 conference			2
" and i do n't see them sprinkling those rights around everywhere , letting a thousand flowers grow quite yet			0
" in that interview eight years ago , @entity5 described the vast divide between technology and entertainment executives , and he talked about how he bridged it			1
" one of the things i learned at @entity20 is the technology industries and the content industries do not understand each other , " he said			0
" in @entity81 and at most technology companies , i swear that most people still think the creative process is a bunch of guys in their early 30s , sitting on a couch , drinking beer and thinking of jokes			1
no , they really do			0
that 's how television is made , they think ; that 's how movies are made			0
" likewise , record executives ca n't relate to technical people , @entity5 said			1
" people in @entity99 and in the content industries , they think technology is something you just write a check for and buy , " @entity5 said			2
" they do n't understand the creative element of technology			2
" these are like ships passing in the night , " the @entity6 co-founder added			0
music execs also may have seen @entity3 as an enemy because its search engine is a popular place to find websites serving pirated albums , according to an article in the @entity116			0
for the ribbon - cutting of the @entity118 in 2003 , @entity6 broke through the barriers with a list of predictions , @entity5 said			1
@entity6 executives provided the record labels with a glimpse into their crystal ball , and nine months later , @entity5 ' team was getting calls from the music companies , he said			1
" the record companies , the most important thing they do is not distribute music , " @entity5 said			1
" it 's picking which of 500 people are going to be the next @entity135			0
that 's what they do			0
and some of them do it quite well			0
and it 's an intuitive process			0
there 's not enough data			0
" ( hey , @entity135 , remember her ? ) " it 's not surprising that they did n't understand @entity54 , " @entity5 said			2
" it 's not surprising that they did n't understand that distributing their content over the @entity150 was the next big wave			0
" because technology companies treat record labels like clearing houses for content , @entity81 bigwigs have trouble getting through the door , @entity5 suggested			1
so it was perhaps @entity5 ' expertise from @entity20 , during his exodus period from @entity6 , that has given him the edge to secure risky deals with entertainment giants first .			1

@entity6 is the first big tech company to secure cloud music storage deals
the record companies may have taken a bet on @entity6 because of their history together
@entity5 said technology companies do n't see eye to eye with entertainment execs
