-- sometimes it feels like president @entity2 never left the public spotlight			1
although there were moments during the 2008 campaign when it seemed he was as much of a target within his own party as were the @entity10 , these days @entity2 is everywhere and democrats want him by their side			1
members of president @entity15 's campaign team say @entity2 will offer them his services next year			1
the re-emergence of president @entity2 in @entity15 's circles has been gradual			1
it has taken time to recover from the tensions that flared during the 2008 @entity11 primaries , when some @entity11 accused @entity2 of making racist remarks following @entity15 's victory over sen. @entity25 in @entity26			1
but over the past year , the @entity27 has brought him back on more and more occasions to strengthen @entity15 's standing			1
what explains the former president 's appeal -- beyond his knowing how to work the necessary magic that got him re-elected in 1996 and left booming approval ratings at the end of his presidency ? his strengths offer some guidance for president @entity15 to improve his standing , even beyond his campaign			1
the first is that president @entity2 was very successful at counteracting republicans when they attacked			2
one of president @entity15 's great frustrations has been the " messaging wars			1
" he has frequently been frustrated by how the @entity10 portrays him to the public and defines his policies in unfavorable ways			2
@entity2 did n't let the @entity10 do that easily			1
when republicans painted the president as left of center early in his term , he responded by aggressively highlighting his centrist credentials , lowering the deficit in 1993 and reforming welfare in 1996			0
although he accepted their terms of debate , unlike when president @entity15 has done the same , he was able to follow through on that co-optation by strengthening his party 's standing			2
when @entity27 @entity10 shut down the government over spending , @entity2 helped convince the public that they were extremists , forcing republicans to backtrack			1
when the @entity10 started the process to impeach president @entity2 in 1998 and 1999 , he focused public attention on that process , which he said was driven purely by partisan concerns			1
@entity10 said that the president was corrupt			0
the president responded that @entity10 were simply using impeachment for partisan purposes			0
the second reason is that president @entity2 was relentless in his focus on the economy			2
@entity2 , who famously campaigned with " it 's the economy , stupid " in 1992 , never took his eye off the ball			1
he continued to hammer away at the recession that he inherited and did n't stop talking about the problems @entity83 faced			0
although @entity2 did turn his attention toward health care in 1993 and 1994 , he continued to work on the economy , such as the @entity86			2
he proposed enterprise zones to try and revitalize urban areas and fought against @entity10 proposed cuts to key domestic programs			0
during the rebound of the mid- 1990s , @entity2 was in a good position to claim credit for the improved circumstances			0
president @entity15 has certainly worked hard to improve the economy			2
in more dramatic fashion than @entity2 , he persuaded @entity97 to pass an economic stimulus bill as well as financial regulation			0
but too often , president @entity15 has seemed focused on other concerns , whether it was health care reform in his first two years as president or deficit reduction after the midterm elections			2
the situation has left many @entity11 yearning for a president who understood that economic recovery was the top priority for many in the party			0
the final reason is that president @entity2 displayed a phenomenal ability to show empathy with @entity83 who were suffering , whether they were struggling with hard economic times or were the victims of the @entity117 bombing			1
although empathy is much different from policy , it was clear that @entity2 's ability to forge connections with voters in small groups , or even through speeches , was one of the reasons his polls remained so strong			1
this has been one of the hardest challenges for the president , who often seems distant and disconnected from the problems facing the country			0
@entity15 , a skilled orator , has had trouble connecting to voters at this level			0
none of this is to ignore the many @entity11 who still look back to the @entity2 years with a skeptical eye			0
after all , some @entity11 argue that he helped to promote the deregulatory policies that fueled the financial meltdown and that he did little to reverse the growing economic inequality in @entity83			0
nonetheless , many aspects of his presidency are attractive in retrospect			0
for all these reasons , president @entity2 is back			0
the man who often positioned himself against the @entity2 legacy is running side by side with him			0
besides the campaign for reelection , president @entity15 should spend some time thinking about what lessons @entity2 has to offer this presidency in the final months of his first term -- and in his second term , should that come to pass			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			0

@entity161 : @entity2 has re-emerged as a *political* force to be cultivated
@entity15 could learn how @entity2 got himself re-elected , he says , won high ratings
@entity161 : @entity2 succeeded in countering @entity10 attacks , stayed focused on economy
another lesson for @entity15 is @entity2 's empathy for struggling @entity83 , he writes
