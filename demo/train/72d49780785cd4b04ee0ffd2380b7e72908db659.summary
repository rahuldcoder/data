-- the @entity2 administration has not always been great at selling its agenda , but the president 's adoption of the right - wing slur " @entity6 " as a prideful new name for the @entity6 has been a notable exception			1
we often think the proper response to being called a dirty name is to object			0
that 's a good first step , but in the long term , the judo approach is constructive -- hurl the power being used against you back to your opponent			0
for example , in 1968 @entity19 could offend @entity21 by calling him a " queer " on television			0
today , the line would feel antique and impotent , in large part because gay men adopted the term for themselves and denatured its sting			0
women today are doing the same with b --- h. black people long ago adopted the n - word as a raffish term of in - group affection , and if you ask me as a black person , we 'd do better to stop going to pieces when white people say it			1
if the word did n't do the job , people would be less likely to use it			2
his idea of emblazoning the @entity49 flag on t - shirts to take possession of it in the name of black @entity54 is inspired			0
the good ole boy hangs a @entity49 flag out his window and black people are walking by under it in t - shirts with the same flag on it -- that 's how you get a new world started			2
yet on @entity6 , we face the awkward fact that the right wing has not been completely vanquished in its quest to vilify the program with a name			2
we hear of quite a few out people out there who confidently espouse the tenets that the @entity6 is based on and yet lustily declare themselves opposed to @entity6 , which they think is something separate			1
( watch this @entity77 video to see people do that very thing			2
) but this does n't mean we 'd be better off if @entity2 had n't adopted the term @entity6			1
for one , for those in favor of the program , the term stands as a useful reminder of one of the few large - scale triumphs of this administration on the domestic policy front			0
health care policy is n't as inherently dramatic as battles over education , the environment or the culture wars			1
in the grand scheme of things , @entity2 's legacy in the popular consciousness is better served by a term as memory friendly as @entity6 , just as the @entity103 administration is better served by its association with @entity105 rather than " @entity106			1
" but what about those @entity6 opponents who think companies should be required to enroll people despite pre-existing conditions and that young people should be able to stay on their parents ' policies until age 26 , while unaware that this makes hating @entity6 about as logical as seeking to breathe while disapproving of respiration ? well , we can assume that in a massive , poorly educated nation such as this one , a healthy segment will display this " keep your government hands off my @entity105 " level of political sophistication			1
we assume , however , that in a modern democracy , change comes from ongoing disputation , as " conversations " move in certain directions			0
it will be hard for such people not to notice , as time goes by , that the provisions they espouse came into being under " @entity6 , " whatever their take on @entity139 ideology			1
even sooner than this , the prevalence of the meme holding these @entity6 - loving @entity6 opponents front and center as national jokes will have a certain effect			2
oh , we wo n't see many contrite admissions of ignorance			0
but that 's not how ideological battles are won			0
as often as not , people admit the truth to themselves , but they 'd have no way to do even that if @entity2 had n't picked up the @entity6 term and lobbed it back			1
@entity45 's idea with the @entity49 flag t - shirts is " now , whaddya gon na do about it ? " for those who want universal health care but hate @entity6 , the ignorance so deep that there 's nowhere to go but up			1
what are they gon na do about it ? learn , apparently -- they could n't avoid it if they tried			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			0

@entity172 : adopting a slur *cancels* its sting : women did it with b - word , blacks with n - word
@entity172 : should @entity2 use " @entity6 , " the @entity182 slur for @entity6 ?
he says @entity186 people support @entity6 , hate @entity6 , think they are different
@entity172 : @entity2 did the right thing to link his name with far - reaching health care *reform*
