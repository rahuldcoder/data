-- the lingering smell of licorice closed several schools around @entity4 , @entity5 , on thursday , nearly a month after a chemical spill that left more than a quarter million people without water			1
the unscheduled holidays underscore ongoing public concern about whether the water is safe to drink after a methanol compound leaked from a tank farm upstream from @entity4			1
though state and federal officials tried to reassure residents this week , " we are still getting feedback that there is a level of worry , " said @entity14 , a spokeswoman for @entity15 , the local water company			1
@entity25 said the licorice odor given off by the chemical -- 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol , known as @entity29 -- is so strong that it can be picked up even if there is no detectable amount in the water			1
the chemical , used to clean coal to reduce ash , leaked into the @entity36 and from there into @entity4 's water supply on january 9			1
the result was a do - not - use order that left about 300,000 people in the area unable to drink or bathe in their water , some for more than a week			1
an elementary and high school located about 15 miles downstream from the january spill closed early wednesday and stayed closed thursday because of renewed complaints about the licorice smell , said @entity48 , a spokeswoman for the state @entity49			1
the complaints came as the schools were trying to flush their water lines to get rid of discolored water after a main broke nearby , she said			1
one high school student went to a hospital after complaining of burning eyes , and a teacher there was taken to the hospital after fainting , @entity48 said			0
school administrators dismissed the students soon after 9 a.m. , she said			0
meanwhile , a grade school in @entity4 was closed early thursday after the licorice smell came out of a dishwasher , the @entity62 reported			0
two other schools were closed as well , the district said			2
@entity25 said some smell and discoloration can be expected as water lines are flushed out			2
but she added , " it does n't mean there is any health risk involved			0
" " we 're pushing it out and getting rid of any trace , " she said			0
an independent water test conducted at @entity0 's request found trace levels of @entity29 earlier this week , both in untreated river water and in tap water from two homes in @entity4			1
the amounts range from less than half a part per billion to 1.6 parts per billion -- well below the safe level of 1 part per million set by the @entity89			2
whether that level is safe has been disputed			2
dr. @entity91 , the director of the @entity89 's @entity89 , told reporters wednesday that repeated testing shows the water is safe			2
" what i can say is that with all the scientific evidence that we have , with everything that numerous people have worked on so far , i can say that you can use your water however you like , " @entity91 said			2
" you can drink it , you can bathe in it , you can use it how you like			0
" and gov. @entity105 said tests have shown levels of less than 10 parts per billion or too low to detect			0
@entity105 said he and his staff have been drinking the water " for the last couple of weeks			0
" but when asked whether he could declare it " 100 % safe , " he said , " no. " " the only thing that we can rely upon is what the experts tell us , and , you know , for all the tests done that 's who we 've got to depend upon , " he said			0
a federal grand jury is probing the spill at @entity123 , the storage facility at the source of leak , sources familiar with the grand jury 's activities told @entity0 this week			0
the spill was originally estimated at about 7,500 gallons , but @entity123 reported in late january that about 10,000 gallons of chemical had escaped			1
the company also told regulators that in addition to the methanol compound that escaped from a ruptured tank , a second chemical -- a mix of polyglycol ethers , known as @entity135 -- was part of the leak			1
@entity135 is not believed to pose any new health hazard for the people of @entity4 , but the state environmental agency said failing to accurately report the makeup of the leak is a violation of state law			0
@entity0 's @entity148 contributed to this report .			0
