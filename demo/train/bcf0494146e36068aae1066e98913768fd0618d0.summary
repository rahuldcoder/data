-- " today ... may 27 ... ... is @entity1 ! ! ! " with those words , @entity2 celebrated -- and invited thousands who have followed his family 's struggles thanks to his online posts to join him -- a major milestone for his daughter @entity9 , as she gamely battles a potentially deadly flesh - eating bacteria			1
two weeks ago , @entity2 wrote on his @entity12 page that the family was anxiously looking forward to a special day he dubbed " @entity16 , " when his 24 - year - old daughter could not only breathe on her own but also talk for the first time in weeks			1
" we 're going to celebrate that day forever for the rest of your life , " @entity2 said he 'd told his daughter , as she lay heavily medicated in a bed at @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21			2
" it 's the day that my daughter was delivered from this horrible , horrible disease			1
" father : ' i have never seen such a strong display of courage ' in recent weeks , surgeons have amputated @entity35 's hands , part of her abdomen , one of her legs , and her remaining foot in their effort to stay ahead of the disease			1
amid all these operations , there has been reported progress			0
last week , for instance , the @entity21 woman " finally stabilized to the point that she has not needed any ventilator assistance for over 24 hours , " her father said			2
yet while she had joked and mouthed words , it was n't until sunday that @entity35 's voice was heard again -- meaning the new holiday can now be etched into her family 's calendars for years to come			1
" today @entity9 has finally spoken her first words , " @entity2 wrote succinctly , promising more details later			0
his daughter was with friends on may 1 near the @entity61 , about 50 miles west of @entity62 , when the zip line that she was holding snapped			2
she fell and got a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close			0
three days later , still in pain , she went to an emergency room , and doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh - devouring bacteria @entity73			1
advocate : story of rare bacterial infection raising awareness her father has written regularly since about her situation , with over 72,500 " likes " on his @entity12 blog devoted to @entity9 's fight			1
and the psychology department at the @entity83 -- where @entity9 has been pursuing her master 's degree in psychology -- also posted regular updates online			2
a number of bacteria , which are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections , can lead to the disease			0
when it gets into the bloodstream -- such as through a cut -- doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain			0
the disease attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20 % of the time , according to the @entity104			0
dr. @entity105 , chairman of the @entity106 at the @entity107 , estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the @entity109 , though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities			0
since @entity2 's struggle came to light , there have been reports of others fighting the same disease			0
they include @entity121 , a @entity123 woman also diagnosed earlier this month , a few days after giving birth to twins			1
she has had at least 11 " debridement surgeries " but thus far no amputations , with her brother @entity127 noting late last week that the disease is confined to his sister 's legs and she , too , is breathing on her own .			0

@entity35 was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis earlier this month
she 's had her hands , leg , part of her abdomen and her remaining foot amputated
her father was looking forward to " @entity142 , " when his daughter would talk again
