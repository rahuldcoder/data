-- every chief justice of the @entity2 picks a signature issue			1
after wednesday 's argument on the future of the @entity7 , it 's clearer than ever that @entity8 has made his choice : to declare victory in the nation 's fight against racial discrimination and then to disable the weapons with which that struggle was won			1
@entity8 ' predecessors staked their ground in many ways			2
in the ' 50s and ' 60s , @entity19 wanted to integrate the @entity21			2
in the next decade , @entity22 decided to fight crime			0
in the ' 80s and ' 90s , @entity24 sought to revive states ' rights			0
@entity8 came of age as a young lawyer in the @entity30 administration , and there he discovered a cause that he has made his own : the color - blind @entity32			1
in @entity8 ' first major decision as chief justice , he rejected the school integration plans of @entity37 and @entity38			1
the authorities in those cities used several factors to determine where kids went to school : neighborhood , sibling attendance , but also racial diversity			0
@entity8 ' decision banned the schools from considering the race of the students in determining where they went to school			1
" the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race , " the chief justice wrote			1
the voting rights martyr who divided @entity2 last october , the court heard a challenge to the race - conscious admissions policy at the @entity65			0
no decision has yet been made in that case , but during the oral argument , the chief justice peppered the lawyer defending the university 's plan with a series of sarcastic questions : " should someone who is one - quarter @entity77 check the @entity77 box or some different box ? " " what is the critical mass of african - americans and @entity77 at the university that you are working toward ? " " so you , what , you conduct a survey and ask students if they feel racially isolated ? " as @entity8 wrote in a different case , summing up his views : " it 's a sordid business , this divvying us up by race			1
" all of that stands as background to the @entity7 case , which was argued wednesday			2
it is generally acknowledged that this law , passed in 1965 , had a tremendous effect in finally making the right to vote real for african - americans , especially in the @entity21			1
under section 5 of the act , nine @entity21 ( and a few other counties ) must get the advance approval for all electoral changes from the @entity107 in @entity108			2
this process , known as pre-clearance , covers everything from drawing the lines of legislative districts to deciding the location of polling places			0
several counties have challenged the law , saying , in effect , that it 's obsolete			0
according to this view , the @entity21 has changed and now @entity103 represents a demeaning and unconstitutional burden on the covered jurisdictions			2
at oral argument , @entity8 seemed very receptive to this claim			2
he asked @entity125 , the solicitor general who defended the law , " is it the government 's submission that the citizens in the @entity21 are more racist than citizens in the @entity132 ? " @entity125 said no , but he said @entity133 still had the right to draw distinctions among states			1
throughout the argument , @entity8 had nothing but tough words for the lawyers defending the law and little to say to the challengers			0
a justice 's questions at oral argument do not always indicate how he is going to vote , but @entity8 ' record on these racial issues is already well - established			1
what does this mean for the country ? it depends on whether you believe , like @entity8 , that the work of the civil rights movement is done			0
race - conscious policies have transformed our schools and workplaces			0
diversity is a value cherished by many			0
likewise , the @entity7 has given the south new and very different politics			0
but affirmative action , in @entity8 ' view , has become discrimination against whites			1
the country may be about to discover how @entity2 looks in the way that the chief justice wants to reshape it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			0

@entity173 : from arguments on @entity7 , it 's clear chief justice opposes it
in past rulings , @entity8 has voted down affirmative action policies , he says
@entity173 : he thinks race *equality* has been won , *remedies* are *reverse* discrimination
@entity173 : @entity7 made the right to vote real for *blacks* , especially in the @entity21
