@entity0 -- where have you gone @entity4 , and why have you been replaced by the likes of woopig.net ? well , at least in the world of sports journalism			1
@entity9 is no longer calling hogs at the @entity11 , because somebody by the handle of " hoggrad " on that popular woopig.net website for @entity17 fans first reported that the @entity11 football coach was n't exactly watching game film that evening			1
let 's just say @entity9 was the @entity21 on the first day of this month courtesy of a motorcycle , a crash and a blonde			1
then along came a police report , a lie and a firing			2
the story began on woopig.net , with much help from hoggrad , whose new handle should be @entity33 or @entity35			2
we 're in a different place , folks			2
that 's because new media have created a slew of investigative reporters among average citizens through personal blogs , @entity45 , @entity46 , talk - show radio , cellphone cameras and recorders , @entity50 and fan websites			1
as a result , those who run professional sports teams have combined with athletics directors on the collegiate level to use a new approach regarding highly successful coaches , managers and others involved with scandalous situations : they whack them			2
not only that , they whack them immediately , before their franchise or university gets embarrassed by several more waves of comments at the end of somebody 's internet post			2
@entity9 fired as @entity11 head football coach " all of this ( instant reporting of scandal ) in regards to how it relates to the electronic media has certainly heightened the information and interest and lessened tolerance , " said @entity75 athletics director @entity74 , who has worked for big - time intercollegiate athletic programs for nearly three decades			1
he also is on the executive committee of the @entity87			2
these intentional and unintentional scoops by nonjournalists go beyond college sports			1
it 's just that the @entity9 situation and others have placed those on campuses in the forefront of it all			1
" ( electronic media ) certainly has sped up the process			1
before , it may have taken a lot longer to make a decision ( on whether to fire somebody )			2
you had to talk to a number of different people before you felt like -- or the organization felt like -- they had gathered enough information to be able to make a reasonable or rational decision , " @entity74 added			2
" now i think that all comes a lot quicker			2
and , in some ways , there 's an expectation that the decision should come quicker			0
i just hope that in these circumstances that the gathering continues to be thorough and that all sides of the issue are being reviewed			0
in january 2003 , everybody saw many sides of @entity123 , and it was n't pretty			0
the @entity124 ran a photo of the former @entity127 basketball coach drinking beer and kissing women at a party near the campus of the @entity131 after an @entity127 loss			0
the @entity134 photo was the first in a string of high - profile sports scandals broken by a random person			1
this one started when a reporter for the @entity124 clicked onto a link on an @entity127 fan site that eventually led him to a fan site for the @entity145			0
moments later , the reporter saw pictures in living color of a plastered @entity134			0
they were posted on the site by a @entity131 student who snapped the pictures at the party			0
the @entity124 acquired the negatives from the @entity131 student , published the photos , and @entity123 was fired			1
that same year , @entity155 received an audiotape of a 2002 telephone conversation between the wife of @entity160 associate head basketball coach @entity159 and a former team ball boy			0
the tape featured @entity159 's wife , @entity163 , confirming to that former ball boy , @entity164 , that she knew he had been molested by her husband			0
the tape came to light at the end of last year , and among other things , it contributed to the end of @entity159 's 35 - year tenure under legendary @entity160 head coach @entity172			0
there also was that 2010 tweet by former @entity176 defensive lineman @entity175			0
it talked of parties and gifts for @entity181 football players , and those revelations led to the @entity183 receiving @entity185 probation , vacating two seasons worth of games and the firing of popular coach @entity189			1
their firings were in contrast to what university bosses did in the past to guilty but effective employees : nothing			0
if the situation was bad enough back then , university bosses might deliver a private or public reprimand			0
they might even clench their teeth while issuing a fine , a suspension or both			0
but firing such a person ? no way			0
not if we 're talking about that generation 's @entity9 , who is n't in line to become the next pope , but who has those worshipping ( as in giving financially to ) the @entity11 as if it were the @entity213 of college football			1
@entity9 had a 21 - 5 record during the last two of his four years at @entity217 , and one of his @entity17 teams earned a berth in the coveted @entity221 for the first time in school history			1
more impressive , @entity11 was picked as a contender for the national championship this season			1
if that is n't enough , @entity11 plays in the @entity228 , where life revolves around breathing and football			1
so , if this were 20 , 30 or any of those years before " tweet " meant more than what birds do , @entity217 officials would have shrugged over @entity9 lying about being alone , when he left a ditch on the side of a rural @entity217 road with four broken ribs and a cracked vertebra after he crashed his motorcycle			1
college suspends woman in @entity9 crash they also would have covered their ears when their 51 - year - old coach later confessed that he was riding with a 25 - year - old female employee of the university named @entity251			1
and that he hired @entity252 under dubious circumstances			0
and that @entity252 was n't his wife or the mother of his four children			0
and that he gave @entity257 a $ 20,000 gift at some point for unknown reasons			0
finally , did we mention that @entity252 was engaged to be married in june to @entity262 , the director of operations for the @entity11 women 's swimming and diving team ? @entity266 surely did .			1

social media is playing a role in some of the biggest college football scandals
new media have created a slew of investigative reporters among average citizens
@entity11 fired @entity9 for not *disclosing* his relationship with female employee
