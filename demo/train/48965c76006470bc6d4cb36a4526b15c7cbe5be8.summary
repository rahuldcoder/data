@entity0 -- there will be plenty of legacy items by which to judge president @entity5			1
@entity6 , for instance : whether the new law that seeks health insurance for every @entity10 is a prudent piece of policy or an albatross of government overreach is a matter of opinion			2
how about drawing down the wars in @entity18 and @entity19 ? what about his efforts to police suspected terrorists abroad through the use of deadly drone strikes ? none of these , in the long run , might be as important as his efforts to help the economy , which , ironically , has felt stronger just as @entity10 ' faith in @entity5 to steer it has dwindled			1
according to a @entity32 poll from november , just 31 % of @entity10 approve of the way he is handling the economy			1
by one measure , the @entity5 economy is almost back to par. if he 's lucky , the economy might be able to save his second term			1
" it 's impossible to tell the future , " said @entity41 , a professor of history and public affairs at @entity44 who has written about presidents and their legacies for @entity1			1
" if the economy moves in a positive direction and in the next two years we are really out of the sluggish economy that he started his presidency with , people will value that			1
" what sort of value remains to be seen			2
the short - memory syndrome certainly , handing off a good economy would help his long - term legacy			1
in the short term , there seems to be little appetite among @entity65 on @entity66 for some of his legislative priorities like raising the minimum wage or passing an immigration reform bill			1
an emboldened president would enter those negotiations with a stronger hand			2
he 'd also have more power to sway budget negotiations that could affect future spending on social programs such as @entity79 and @entity80			2
@entity81 , a political science professor at the @entity82 , @entity83 , said @entity10 have short memories			2
" to a kind of ironic extent , if presidents come in facing big problems and they 're able to do something to solve those problems , people do n't evaluate them based on those problems , " he said			2
" it becomes a kind of , ' what have you done for me lately ? ' problem , " said @entity81 , who thinks @entity5 's domestic legacy will be focused squarely on the health care law			1
" i think if the health care law is in place and works , he 'll be remembered really favorably , " said @entity81 , comparing the law to the @entity102 social programs enacted by president @entity103			2
the @entity10 unemployment rate fell to 7 % in november			0
it 's an imperfect measure for the health of the economy			1
people long unemployed and who are n't looking for work are n't counted , for example			1
but that 's the lowest unemployment rate since @entity5 was first elected president , when the rate sat at 6.8 %			1
in hindsight , that 6.8 % figure from 2008 seems low , either because @entity10 at the time were used to much lower jobless rates or because in the time since then we 've become used to much higher rates			0
in 2008 , the economic ground was rumbling with talk of the potential for an economic apocalypse			0
the unemployment rate grew a full percentage point in the 2 1/2 months between his election that year and his inauguration in january 2009 , and it peaked a little less than a year into his presidency at 10 % in october 2009			0
now we call it the @entity136 , something much worse than your father 's recession but probably not quite as bad as your grandfather 's @entity141			0
the @entity10 government took an activist approach to saving the economy			1
it began pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into bailouts of the banking and auto industries in the final days of the @entity151 administration			0
the @entity152 was just beginning to pump trillions of dollars into the economy through a menu of bond - buying programs and artificially low interest rates			1
taking an approach , running with it @entity5 took this activist approach and ran with it			1
he spent a good portion of his new political capital passing a nearly $ 800 billion stimulus program opposed by all but three @entity65 in the @entity165			0
the rollout of the stimulus , by the way , was beset by a flawed website and created a huge political headache as those hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars flooded into the economy -- the effect was not immediately felt by everyone and it was hard to quantify as it was spread across years			1
even if the recovery is felt most prominently in the coming years , it could affect perception of those early programs , @entity41 said			0
" if the last two years of the @entity5 presidency are filled with a possibility economy , it 's going to change the way we view the stimulus and his other economic programs , " he said			1
temporary increases to food stamps authorized by the stimulus package only ran out at the beginning of november			0
temporary increases in unemployment insurance are set to run out at the end of this year			0
the ultimate effect of billions spent on infrastructure had a short - term effect on jobs , but will also have long - term benefits			1
continued growth will come with growing pains			0
@entity152 chairman @entity203 or his soon - to - be successor @entity204 are expected to taper off the @entity152 programs that have helped buoy the back end of the economy and kept interest rates down			1
the @entity209 guessed that the stimulus kept the unemployment rate 2 % lower than it otherwise would have been in 2010			0
that means the country could have faced 12 % unemployment instead of 10 % at the height of the @entity136 , but we 'll never know for sure			0
what we do know is that the national debt skyrocketed as the federal government spent furiously to save the economy			1
the stimulus cost $ 830 billion , according to the @entity209			0
deficits have started to shrink as the economy has improved and @entity65 in @entity224 have insisted on spending cuts			1
but the debt now stands at nearly $ 17 trillion			0
@entity10 's debt : @entity227 special section a @entity230 rally ; a widening divide but while the stock market has rallied during the @entity5 presidency -- the @entity232 has nearly doubled during his time in office -- the divide between wealthy and struggling @entity10 has grown exponentially			1
potentially rising interest rates and less help for the unemployed and the hungry as those stimulus programs run out could exacerbate the problem , which @entity5 has made clear will be a focus of his remaining time in office			1
" i believe this is the defining challenge of our time : making sure our economy works for every working @entity10			2
it 's why i ran for president			0
it was at the center of last year 's campaign , " @entity5 told a liberal group during a speech in an economically depressed area of @entity0 , on wednesday			1
" it drives everything i do in this office			0
and i know i 've raised this issue before , and some will ask why i raise the issue again right now			0
" he later added that he think the government should be spending money to invest in creating opportunities for @entity10			0
" a relentlessly growing deficit of opportunity is a bigger threat to our future than our rapidly shrinking fiscal deficit , " he said			0
after his re-election , @entity5 extended @entity151 - era tax cuts for all but the wealthiest @entity10 , making good on his campaign effort to make them pay a little more in the coming years			1
the economy for years has been the issue that @entity10 want politicians to fix			2
more than health care or the @entity18 war , the economy dominated the 2008 election â € ” 55 % of voters said it was the most important problem facing the country			2
four years later , when @entity5 was re-elected , the economy and unemployment split the top spot			1
perhaps one sign of an improved economy is that a different poll , conducted by @entity287 in october , found that the economy is no longer the top concern of @entity10			2
now it is " government dysfunction			0
" two academics wrote recently that @entity294 presidents seem to preside over generally better economies than @entity65			0
but there 's no evidence that their policies are the reason			0
that means it 's perhaps not fair to give presidents credit when the economy improves or blame them when it goes bad			2
" it 's never fair , " @entity41 said			0
" presidents do n't have total control of the economy			2
they ca n't even control @entity224			0
but fair or not , that 's what happens			0

the @entity5 legacy likely will *include* many elements
one will be the economy
it might even be the one in the long - term of history
