editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity3 , is governor of @entity4			1
gov. @entity2 says opposition to the stimulus bill does n't mean doing nothing to fix the economy			1
@entity9 , @entity4 ( @entity10 ) -- when a debate as important -- both in terms of policy and politics -- as the one currently rolling around our nation regarding the president 's " stimulus " plan takes place , emotion often takes precedence over fact			1
words are ripped out of context , motives ascribed where none may exist , political strategies implemented with limited regard for actuality			0
this , then , is the playing field we step onto -- as it has long been			0
but , as those in @entity4 have often heard me say , it is important to disagree without being disagreeable			0
so let 's take a clear - eyed look at @entity40 's recent defense of the president , which happened to refer to me by name -- because what i and others have suggested is far from " doing nothing			0
" first , dispense with the notion that there are simply two options here : support the stimulus package or do nothing			1
the @entity54 debunked that idea quite convincingly earlier this week			0
in truth , there are a variety of options outside a spending bill of unprecedented scope available in this time of considerable economic distress , including , but not limited to , cutting the payroll tax , opening foreign markets through an expansion of our trade agreements , and reducing our corporate tax , which is among the highest worldwide			1
second , we should all be skeptical of any argument centered on the idea of doing something for doing something 's sake			2
we ca n't focus on the why and simply ignore the what			1
and what does this particular rendition of " doing something " actually do ? according to the @entity81 , the effects of the bill on job growth as early as 2011 would be miniscule			0
more distressingly , @entity81 's long - term projections estimate that due to " crowding out of private investment , " the package will result in a reduction of our gdp as early as 2019			0
as for the jobs created in the short - term , what 's the cost ? the @entity91 crunched the president 's own numbers and came up with this startling figure : for every single job the bill creates , @entity96 taxpayers will spend $ 223,000			0
examining the bill 's contents makes clear just how foolhardy that is			0
what stimulant effect will we get from the $ 180 million of spending on " diplomatic and consular services ? " should taxpayers really be doling out $ 300 million for what one newspaper described as " streamlined golf carts ? " and , even though it did n't make it into the final version of the bill , why would anyone even consider letting the very investment bankers whose companies just pulled down a few hundred million dollars in @entity117 funds to be in line to receive a $ 15,000 government credit for buying a new @entity121 beach house ? finally , history shows us quite clearly that a government can not spend its way out of an economic downturn			1
it did n't work in @entity127 in the 1990s , when the 10 stimulus packages implemented over an eight year period failed to prevent the " lost decade			1
" and the @entity131 , which the president 's supporters are so quick to point to ? here are the thoughts of @entity135 , @entity136 's treasury secretary : " we have tried spending money			2
we are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work			2
... i say after eight years of this administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started ... and an enormous debt to boot ! " the president 's stimulus represents the largest and most invasive economic action in our government 's history			1
for a relatively small number of short - term jobs , this administration and this @entity149 are poised to mortgage the economic future of my four boys and the millions of young @entity96 just like them			2
to me , that 's simply not a morally acceptable outcome			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : opposing the stimulus is n't an argument for doing nothing
he says tax and trade policies could be used to *bolster* the economy
@entity2 says expanded spending will not get us out of the economic *turndown*
he says he ca n't support *burdening* our kids with the debt from stimulus plan
