@entity0 , @entity1 -- in @entity0 , you 'll find a contemporary olympic stadium , ancient @entity6 columns and chimneys that look like space aliens			1
the capital of the @entity1 region of @entity11 has reinvented itself a number of times			2
but it seems to hold a special place for both its medieval and moderniste sides			1
while planning my first visit to the city , i was certain i would be most interested in exploring the @entity20 , @entity0 's old city , with its narrow streets and centuries - old churches			1
but i also had every intention to follow the tourist checklist , and visit a few of the @entity27 modernist buildings for which the city is well known			1
@entity29 , or @entity27 modernism , is a cultural movement that took hold in @entity0 in the late 1800s , encompassing @entity33 and other artistic styles			1
its followers embraced asymmetry , bright colors and curving lines			2
but from pictures i saw before my trip , the style did n't seem nearly as appealing as @entity0 's medieval masterpieces			1
the old city was enchanting , especially the @entity44 , or gothic quarter			2
local school kids ' voices echoed in an ancient square , as my husband and i meandered through a maze of cobblestone streets , walled with medieval palaces and churches			2
there are antique shops , where collectors can find anything from teacups to old posters , and on the weekends local artists hawk their wares at open - air markets in some of the larger squares			2
there are plenty of restaurants and cafes for tapas , sangria and people - watching			2
tourists pass with their noses in guidebooks , while locals walk quickly , seemingly unaware of the splendor surrounding them			0
if the old city made us feel a bit claustrophobic , a stroll up @entity80 was the cure			2
the wide street is the main boulevard leading through @entity84 , the extension to the city built in the mid- 1800s			1
in the midst of chic shops and restaurants are some breathtaking examples of @entity27 modernist architecture			1
@entity84 was built as @entity0 was starting to thrive as an economic center in a way it had n't since the @entity95			1
the showy moderniste style took shape as successful entrepreneurs commissioned elaborate villas			2
architects employed contemporary materials like glass , ceramic and iron , but also drew inspiration from @entity106 and @entity107 styles			0
i learned to appreciate @entity27 modernism as soon as i caught sight of @entity111 , a large home designed by @entity112 , perhaps the most famous moderniste architect			1
its colorful exterior sparkles with bits of broken glass , the curving rooftop is covered in a rainbow of scales , and the rounded balconies seem to be shaped out of bone			0
@entity112 was a pioneer of @entity27 modernism			1
he drew inspiration from nature , and his distinctive style featured bold shapes and colors			0
he created many of @entity0 's greatest tourist attractions , including another eye - catching work on @entity80 , a large apartment building called @entity131			1
its undulating exterior is made of natural - colored stone , and does n't feature a single straight line			0
the one - of - a - kind fa√ßade is accented with twisting iron balconies			0
but the most interesting feature has to be the rooftop -- a surreal landscape of peaks and valleys , where tourists pose for photos in front of chimneys that look like something between masked warriors and space aliens			0
even the tiles that make up the sidewalks on @entity80 feature a reproduction of a swirling design by @entity112			1
the rounded street benches and ornate iron lampposts keep with the theme			0
a study in contrasts a trip to @entity0 would n't be complete without visiting its array of churches			2
the city 's houses of worship capture both the medieval and @entity27 modernist styles			1
towering over the old city is @entity0 's cathedral , an imposing example of a medieval @entity170 church			1
the exterior features spires , gargoyles and a grand entranceway of concentric arches			0
inside it 's large , yet peaceful			2
the vaulted ceilings , delicately detailed stained glass , and elaborate woodcarvings inspire quiet contemplation			0
about two - dozen gilded side chapels tell stories of martyrs and saints			0
the adjacent cloister is a peaceful oasis , featuring palm trees , a mossy pond and a flock of geese			0
while the cathedral is ornate and overwhelming , the nearby basilica , @entity192 , is simpler			0
built in just over 50 years in the 14th century , the church is considered the finest surviving example of the pure @entity107 style			0
inside , the soaring columns and window after window of stained glass , even the rose window , somehow seem elegantly understated			0
my favorite features were the ominous skulls and crossbones on the floor , marking burial sites			0
the gothic interior of the @entity192 is said to have inspired the design of another church that 's a short subway trip away , though worlds distant -- @entity112 's masterpiece , the @entity213			1
i have to admit that , viewing it from a distance , i could see why some consider it an eyesore			0
but up close , and with the help of the provided audio guide , i learned to appreciate the religious symbolism that completely coats its outdoor facades			0
all skepticism slipped away once i stepped inside			0
@entity224 casts a rainbow through the multi-colored stained glass windows , and gothic columns seem to grow up and up to the towering ceiling , where they branch out like trees			0
nearly 130 years after the project broke ground , construction cranes still loom over its towers			0
it 's hoped the church will be complete by the 100th anniversary of @entity112 's death , in 2026			1
meanwhile , pope @entity239 consecrated it as a basilica last november			0
it 's a spiritual place , but in a way that 's completely different from @entity0 's medieval churches			1
instead of dark and solemn , the @entity213 is bright and even cheerful , a celebration of nature and devotion			0
for fans of @entity27 modernism there is much more to see			1
@entity0 's @entity252 offers a guidebook featuring 115 buildings on a " modernisme route			1
" if you ca n't get enough of the medieval , visit @entity0 's @entity259			1
it 's most famous for its one - of - a - kind collection of @entity261 , dating back to the 11th century			2
the works were mostly salvaged from churches in the @entity264			2
@entity0 's rich history ca n't be fully appreciated by just visiting moderniste and medieval sites , but in a city with so much to experience , it 's a great place to start .			1
