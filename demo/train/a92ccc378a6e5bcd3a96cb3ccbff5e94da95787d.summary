-- in march 2010 i found out my twin sister , @entity2 , needed a kidney transplant			1
with a body mass index of well over 50 , i was ruled out as a donor			1
at that moment , i decided i would get healthy once she got healthy			1
i decided that my weight would never again keep me from doing something i wanted			1
@entity2 got a new kidney in june and was finally getting back on her feet in september			1
then it was my turn			1
i weighed 385 pounds -- and no , it was n't because i like to eat			1
i grew up as a fat kid , and food was my coping mechanism			1
in september 2011 , i started walking			1
by the end of the year , i started making better food choices			1
in january 2012 , i joined my local y , where i started taking water classes such as @entity23 cardio and hydrorider			2
in june 2012 i was down to 330 pounds			1
one of my best friends , @entity26 , volunteered to help me lose even more weight			2
she figured out quickly that i loved sports ; more than anything i wanted to be an athlete			2
she came up with a plan for us to approach my weight loss in phases			2
at the end of each phase , i would do some athletic feat. at the end of phase one , i would run a @entity40 without stopping			2
phase two was a half marathon			2
she suggested a triathlon for phase three ; i laughed in her face and told her she was crazy			2
one morning i heard @entity48 on " the @entity49 " recount the biggest lesson he had learned from being part of the @entity53 team			1
that lesson was " in times of transition , keep moving forward			2
it does n't matter how you do it , as long as you keep going forward			2
" that year was a time of transition for me and to " keep moving forward , " i knew i had to be part of the 2013 @entity53 team			1
on christmas day 2012 , i got the best present ever : a @entity64 message from a producer saying @entity0 had to talk to me			0
i knew this was going to be big			0
" surprise , welcome and congratulations			0
... " i heard those words from dr. @entity70 and immediately screamed and started to cry			0
i finally had a team , and i was going to be a triathlete in nine months			0
the biggest obstacle for me was cycling			0
i had never clipped into a bike , and i was terrified by the thought of it			0
by the time we got to our midway training trip in @entity79 , @entity80 , i was doing better but still hated it			0
with two words , my trainer @entity82 made me a cyclist on that trip -- and started to heal some emotional scars			0
we were coming off a huge hill , and she said , " let go			0
... " at that point she was talking about the brakes , but we had been talking all day about my self - perception			0
like braking on a bike , i was holding on too tightly to people , words and situations that had hurt me and to worries about things over which i have absolutely no control			0
5 lessons we learned while training for our first triathlon when it came time for the @entity102 , i had no fear			1
i knew without a doubt i would finish			0
i was so excited and thankful for this opportunity to live out a childhood dream of being on a team			0
i had lost nearly 200 pounds and was healthier and happier than ever			1
as i was out on the course , i would see my teammates , and every time we would yell words of encouragement to each other			1
it did n't matter who finished first as long as we finished			0
i had a sense of finally belonging			0
i never felt more free and confident in my life as i did when i threw my hands in the air as i crossed the finish line			0
i left all the words and actions that hurt and haunted me since childhood along with the unhealthy , unhappy woman i used to be at the finish line in @entity126 on september 8 , 2013			1
i had finally " let go			0
" now the only thing left to do is keep moving forward			0
