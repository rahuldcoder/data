-- a @entity2 judge set aside the death sentence of a convicted killer after concluding friday that race played a role in the case , a landmark ruling that may call into question a number of death row cases in the state			1
the ruling by @entity16 superior court judge @entity14 , the first under the state 's controversial @entity18 , means that 38 - year - old @entity20 now faces life in prison without the possibility of parole			1
@entity20 , who is black , was convicted of first - degree murder in 1994			1
at the center of the judge 's ruling is a finding that prosecutors across the state participated in the practice of excluding potential black jurors			0
" @entity20 introduced a wealth of evidence showing the persistent , pervasive and distorting role of race in jury selection throughout @entity2 , " @entity34 wrote in his ruling			1
" the evidence , largely unrebutted by the @entity42 , requires relief in his case and should serve as a clear signal of the need for reform in capital jury selection proceedings in the future			0
" weeks did not question whether the crime was committed by @entity20 , who was convicted of killing a white , 17 - year - old teen -- @entity53			1
passed by the state legislature and signed into law in 2009 , the @entity18 states " no person shall be subject to or given a sentence of death , or shall be executed pursuant to any judgment that was sought or obtained on the basis of race			1
" under the law , those with death sentences can appeal by using statistical analysis to prove race played a role in how their case was handled			2
the cornerstone of @entity20 's appeal is a @entity71 study of jury selection in @entity2 in 1994 , the time during which @entity20 was sentenced , that found prosecutors struck blacks from juries at a rate of more than 2 - to - 1 compared with whites			1
in the ruling , @entity34 found that not only did prosecutors across the state intentionally use the race of a potential juror as a significant factor in decisions to exercise preemptory challenges -- the practice of striking somebody from a jury without explanation , but that the practice occurred in @entity20 's case			1
the @entity94 of @entity95 strongly disputed that race had anything to do with death sentences in effect across the state			2
" while we respectfully disagree with @entity103 , we are not surprised by his ruling , " the group said in a written statement			0
the group has been opposed to the @entity18 , saying that cases should not be decided by generalized statistics presented years after a conviction			2
" capital cases reflect the most brutal and heinous offenders in our society			0
whether the death penalty is an appropriate sentence for murderers should be addressed by our lawmakers in the @entity118 , not masked as claims ( of ) racism in our courts , " the statement said			1
@entity20 is among 157 death row inmates -- 83 blacks , 63 whites and 12 other ethnicities -- who filed appeals under the @entity18 , according to records from the @entity2 @entity127			1
the @entity128 in @entity2 , meanwhile , expressed their sympathies to the family of @entity20 's victim , while lauding the ruling			2
" we take this moment to remind prosecutors and their staffs that the @entity18 mentions the idea of training program , to help weed out racial bias as they exercise their broad discretion in capital cases , " said the rev. @entity133 , president of the @entity128 in @entity2			2
" we encourage the @entity143 to take advantage of such training to drain some of the unconscious and conscious racial bias out of our courthouses			0
" after friday 's ruling , @entity20 's mother @entity148 told @entity0 affiliate @entity150 that her son expected friday 's decision " because it was true facts , and that 's it			0
" she said she understood that the ruling could make way for other such successful appeals in @entity2			0
" this has been a hard long journey , " @entity148 said			0
" and there are others out there who will be affected by this			0
" @entity0 's @entity163 contributed to this report .			0

@entity20 was sentenced to death after being convicted of murder in 1994
a judge calls race " a significant factor " in his death sentence and *vacates* it
the @entity18 bars executions " sought or obtained on the basis of race "
*district* *attorneys* blast actions against the death penalty " masked as claims racism "
