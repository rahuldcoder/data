-- a former @entity5 football player fatally shot by police in @entity7 , @entity8 , was clearly seeking help after a car wreck -- and video from the squad car 's dashboard camera will prove it , an attorney for the man 's family said wednesday			1
officer @entity14 shot the unarmed @entity15 , 24 , last month after a woman -- home alone with her 1 - year - old child -- called 911 and reported that someone was trying to break down her front door			1
@entity15 had wrecked his car down the street and had simply gone to the nearest home seeking help , family attorney @entity21 said			1
" i completely understand her situation			0
she 's at home by herself , 2 in the morning , with a baby			2
i completely understand that she was frightened , " @entity21 said			0
" but had she taken the time to just speak through the door and find out what was going on , rather than say , ' he 's trying to rob me ' or ' he 's trying to beat down the door , ' i think she would 've had a different understanding			0
" the woman initially opened the door , @entity21 said , questioning why she would report a home invasion			1
had @entity15 been an intruder , he would have burst into her home when she opened the door , he said			1
911 call : a plea for help before police officer shoots unarmed man but the attorney was quick to say he was n't judging the woman or her actions			1
still , he said , it was " unconscious bias " that led to @entity15 's death			1
according to the 911 tape , the woman told a dispatcher , " i need help ! " " there 's a guy breaking in my front door , " she continued			1
" he 's trying to kick it down			0
" her reaction was understandable , @entity21 said , but @entity14 's was not			0
" the onus is n't on the homeowner			0
the onus really here is on the officer , because it 's the officer 's job			0
he 's a trained professional			0
an officer can not , " @entity21 said			0
@entity14 was charged with felony voluntary manslaughter , meaning he is accused of either using excessive force in self - defense or shooting @entity15 without the intent to kill him			1
@entity14 turned himself in september 14 , the day of the shooting , and was released the following day on $ 50,000 bond			0
" we are confident that at the resolution of this case , it will be found that officer @entity14 's actions were justified on the night in question , " his attorney , @entity75 , said			2
the @entity83 did not concur , releasing a statement calling the shooting unlawful			0
" the evidence revealed that mr. @entity15 did advance on @entity89 and the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of mr. @entity15 was excessive , " police said in a statement the day of the shooting			1
" our investigation has shown that officer @entity14 did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter			0
" the statement further said , " it has devastated a family as well as caused a great deal of sadness and anxiety in our organization			0
" police used the words " charged , " " ran " and " advanced " in describing @entity15 's interaction with police			1
but @entity21 said the young man merely walked " briskly " toward them and surmised that @entity15 was relieved police had arrived to help him			1
an officer tried to subdue @entity15 with a stun gun but was " unsuccessful , " police have said			1
@entity14 opened fire after that			0
a video from a dashboard camera will show @entity14 committed " cold - blooded murder , " @entity21 said , demanding that the tape be released to the public			2
" the public should see the video ... because it tells the story better than anyone , " he said			0
about a block away from the shooting , @entity15 's car was wrecked so severely that " he was lucky to have survived , " @entity21 said			1
police told local media that @entity15 had to crawl out the back window of the vehicle			1
describing the incident allegedly caught by the dashboard camera , @entity21 said @entity15 was on the sidewalk when police arrived			1
@entity15 walked toward them , he said			1
" even if they suspected that he was robbing the house from the 911 call , most robbers run the other way when law enforcement comes , " the attorney said			1
two lasers hit @entity15 's chest before the 24 - year - old raised his hands , " like , wait , " @entity21 said , further describing the tape			1
it was n't clear if the laser were sights from the stun gun or a firearm			0
without any verbal warning from police , four shots were fired , then there was a pause before six more gunshots , and another pause before the final two rounds , the attorney said			2
ten of those 12 bullets hit @entity15 , killing him instantly , @entity21 said			2
" that 's not a scared officer			0
that 's someone intending to kill , " he said , saying he believes a jury will agree , as it 's " unprecedented " for police to arrest one of their own so swiftly after a shooting			2
family members have said @entity15 was a happy , outgoing guy , who loved @entity169 as a child			2
the former gymnast , football player and @entity5 chemistry major was working two jobs at the time of the shooting , his mother , @entity172 , has said			0
his fiancee , @entity178 , told @entity0 on wednesday that @entity15 had been out with friends from one of those jobs , at @entity182 , the night he was shot			1
@entity178 described @entity15 as someone who was always joking and finding ways to make people smile			1
his demeanor was so gentle and caring , she said , that she nicknamed him " sweets			2
" " he 's always a joy to be around			0
he cared so much for other people , more so than himself , " she said			2
she said she hopes @entity14 is convicted and that her fiance 's death will spur dialogue across the nation			0
" that is a hope i have , that his death will resound for a country that prides itself on being diverse and inclusive and accepting everyone for who they are , " she said			0
@entity21 , who said the family would file a civil suit , also expressed hope that the release of the police video would yield a teachable moment			2
" there are other police departments , there are other officers , there are other people who can learn from this video , especially in the day of ' stand your ground , ' " the lawyer said			2
@entity0 's @entity217 contributed to this report .			0
