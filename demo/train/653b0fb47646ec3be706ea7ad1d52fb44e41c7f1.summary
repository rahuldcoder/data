-- there 's a famous scene in the movie " titanic " where @entity5 turns to @entity6 and says , " i want you to draw me like one of your @entity10 girls			1
" then she poses for him naked , and things start looking up for ol ' @entity6			1
of course , later , the ship sinks and he dies a cold , suffering death in the middle of the @entity19			1
still , it was totally worth it			1
at the end , most people think @entity6 's final words to @entity5 were , " never let go			1
" but i 'm pretty sure i heard him say , " huh , huh			1
" almost 20 years later , that stupid " @entity10 girls " line has become a bit of a catchphrase , and if you @entity33 it you 'll find countless images of people unintentionally , yet seductively , sprawled out like @entity37			1
and some sprawled animals , too			1
" taking it a step further , now there 's even a portrait - sketching mobile app called @entity10 girls that has also clearly borrowed from " @entity4			1
" and everyone 's talking about it			1
@entity48 co-founder , 29 - year - old @entity47 , told me , " the day - over - day growth in just the past few days has been astonishing , and it 's not slowing down			1
" his creation just passed one million downloads			2
the app actually came out in mid- 2013			1
but then , last week , it had a massive uptick in popularity when , for several hours , a collection of @entity10 girls images somehow managed to climb to the very top of the front page of @entity61			1
it 's an honorable feat for which , generally speaking , there 's no apparent rhyme or reason			2
( for instance , as i write this , the current most popular post on @entity61 is a video of a girl dangerously falling off a diving board			1
it looks painful and unfortunate , but this is why we have the @entity76 , and somehow it makes my life more complete			2
) now , the basic idea of @entity10 girls is that users anonymously post selfies and then other users draw them from within the app. it 's fun			1
and it 's surprisingly creative			2
but mostly , it 's easy			2
the app 's slogan simply reads : take selfies			1
when i first learned of @entity10 girls and downloaded it , i immediately served up a selfie and eagerly awaited someone turning me into art. perhaps a tasteful nude			2
but , so far , nobody has shown any interest in drawing my portrait			2
so , i added another selfie - one where it looks like i 'm grasping at the air -- and somebody actually did turn me into a nude			2
however , it 's far from tasteful			2
the " artist " extended my body into the next frame , naked , where i appear to be violating myself			0
this is why we ca n't have nice things			0
and it 's obvious that he put literally seconds into his effort			0
( yes , despite the app 's anonymity , i assure you it was definitely a he			1
because of course it was			0
) alas , not everything turns out a masterpiece in @entity10 girls			0
but , hey , at least he chose me ! because here 's how the app works : when you want to start drawing , you are given a choice of nine different images			1
if nothing inspires you , the refresh button gives you nine more			0
and you can keep searching until you find someone ( or someone 's dog ) that does tickle your artistic fancy			0
for me it was a girl with blue hair and a nose ring			0
so , i drew her			0
my only real talent is napping			0
that , and mouth breathing			0
you can read all about it on my @entity151 profile			0
anyway , despite a severe lack of artistic ability , drawing my blue girl was a creative way to kill some time when i could 've dangerously been interacting with other actual humans			0
which , for safety , i prefer to avoid			0
because next thing you know a friend invites you to get outside and go to the pool			0
and then you find yourself on a diving board			0
