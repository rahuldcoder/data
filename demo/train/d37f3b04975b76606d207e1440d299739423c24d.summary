death penalty a heated moment came when @entity3 accused @entity1 of delaying an execution so that his attorney general could attend a political fundraiser			1
" she asked me to delay it because it did n't work on the dates that she thought it was going to be on , " @entity1 said in response			1

no fangate repeat the night got off to a breezy start , this time with no fan on stage for @entity3 and no protest from @entity1			1
" everybody 's comfortable here ? " asked @entity11 's @entity55 , who co-moderated the debate with @entity12 's @entity57			0
his question was a subtle reference to last week 's seven minute standoff			0
the debate quickly transitioned into a testy exchange with personal attacks over wealth			1
@entity1 blamed @entity3 for the loss of more than 800,000 jobs while he was governor from 2007 - 2011 , saying @entity3 is out of touch with average @entity2 voters because he grew up with wealth			1

i do n't know my natural father			0
i lived in public housing			0
i have an adopted dad , " @entity1 said			1

@entity3 , you lost more jobs than any state but one			1
" hammering back , @entity3 argued he was not responsible for the " economic meltdown " that occurred nationally during his tenure			1
he returned the attack against wealth , blasting @entity1 for being the one who 's out of touch			2
" you do n't know me and you ca n't tell my story , " @entity3 said			1
" but i know you are worth about $ 100 million or $ 200 million today and @entity91 bless you for that wealth , but the way you got it was pretty unsavory			0
" @entity1 , a former health care ceo , ran into controversy when his company , @entity98 / @entity97 , was fined $ 1.7 billion for alleged @entity100 fraud last decade			2
restoring rights for felons @entity1 took a jab at @entity3 for bringing voting rights back to felons who had completed their sentences for nonviolent convictions			1
" here is @entity3 's plan : you commit a heinous crime , as soon as you get out of jail , you get to vote			2
stalk , you get to vote			0
you have intentional permanent disfigurement of a child and you walk out of jail and you get to vote , " @entity1 said			2
@entity3 fired back , accusing @entity1 of " lying " and saying the restoration law only applied to nonviolent criminals			1

" sure , " he said			0
pressed on what the minimum wage should be , @entity1 added : " how would i know -- i mean , the private sector decides wages			2
" he went on to deflect and attack @entity3 on the loss of jobs during his governorship , calling him a " zero - wage governor			2
" asked to clarify if he supports the idea of the government setting a minimum wage , @entity1 answered : " just because they set a minimum wage does n't mean you get a job			1
" @entity3 , who supports raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 , said he still stands by it , saying people " deserve " a higher wage even if it means some companies might have to lay people off as a consequence			2
@entity146 @entity55 asked @entity3 how he would rate , on a scale of 1 - 10 , president @entity149 's handling of the ebola virus in the @entity151			2
" i 'd probably give him an eight			0
i think we had a little bit of a slow start , and i think everybody kinda recognizes that			0
