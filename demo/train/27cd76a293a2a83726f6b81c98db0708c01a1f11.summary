-- the powerful 8.2 - magnitude earthquake that struck northern @entity2 on tuesday night came after a series of quakes had shaken the @entity6 area in recent weeks			1
could there be a link between these recent seismic events ? do they portend a larger and perhaps more dire planetary crisis ? a sign that a tectonic doomsday may soon be upon us ? " no , " said dr. @entity15 , a geologist with the @entity19 's @entity18			2
" totally unrelated , " agreed @entity21 geophysicist @entity20			0
" the most important thing everyone needs to remember is these are two of some of the most seismologically active places in the world , " @entity0 meteorologist @entity22 said			0
so you can rest a little easier , @entity29			0
your state and @entity2 lie on different faults that " are too far apart " for the earthquakes to be linked , according to @entity35			1
@entity2 's latest quake occurred between the @entity38 and @entity39 plates along the @entity40 , a region that " has produced some of the largest earthquakes in the world , " according to the @entity19 website			2
the @entity6 - area quakes occurred within the @entity46 thrust zone , which while not as large or as well - known as @entity49 's infamous @entity48 , is potentially as destructive because of its precarious location under downtown @entity6 , according to @entity0 meteorologist @entity51			2
as for why the quakes all occurred around the same time period : " it 's just a natural cycle of seismicity , " @entity35 said			1
but even though the earthquakes are not linked , anyone living in " seismologically active places " should nevertheless always be prepared			0
" @entity59 should use what 's been going on in the last few weeks as a reminder to get their stuff in order so they are not surprised , " @entity20 said			0
@entity2 quake was big , but a bigger one awaits			1

@entity49 was *rattled* by temblors for weeks before big quake in @entity2
the two sites lie on different faults , so the seismic activity is not related , *scientists* say
the *cluster* of quakes is " just a natural cycle of seismicity , " *experts* says
