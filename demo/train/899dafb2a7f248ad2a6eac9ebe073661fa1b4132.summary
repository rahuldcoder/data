-- this is ballet , but not as you know it			1
for one , there 's not a ballerina in sight			0
@entity7 have been replaced with bare chests and tights , pointe shoes have been tossed aside for slippers , and delicate @entity12 © colletages have been swapped for beefed - up biceps			1
once the traditional arena of lithe ladies , ballet is seeing an increasing number of all - male shows -- in one of the biggest shake - ups in the history of the profession			1
men in motion " my attempt is to show a century of male dance in a hundred minutes , " said @entity26 - born @entity25 , the creator of " @entity27 , " an ambitious all - male production featuring 15 short dances			1
" just as you hear about the feminist movement and how women gained the right to vote , well men gained the right of center stage , " added the 34 - year - old former @entity33 dancer , who has toured the groundbreaking show across @entity35			1
think of ballet , and you 'll most likely conjure images of pirouetting ladies in elegant tutus -- not performances " full of testosterone , " as " men in motion " dancer @entity44 describes it			1
" for the last 100 years everything has changed -- men are bringing new creativity , new ways of doing things to the stage			0
" @entity59 it 's not the first show to be given a men - only makeover			2
when @entity66 choreographer @entity65 's all - male @entity59 premiered in @entity67 almost two decades ago , it was considered revolutionary in the traditional world of ballet			1
@entity65 studied the movements of real swans for the show , displaying both their ungainly flapping and menacing power through dance			0
" it 's not twee and pretty , that 's for sure , " said @entity77 , who plays @entity78 in what has since become one of the longest - running ballets in @entity67 's @entity82			2
" we are bare - chested , we have feathered legs , and this quite striking beak on our face			2
all the guys are pumped up and it is very serious			0
" smashing stereotypes that 's not to say male ballet dancers ca n't also be beautiful and tender on stage			1
" i think there is always the concept of the ballerina who is this delicate creature , and men are the opposite -- we jump higher , we have more stamina , we are stronger , " said @entity96			0
" but at the same time maybe when you see us in a fragile setting we can also be delicate			0
" " that 's what you normally do n't see ... my best memories of my father are when he cries , so of course i love when i can see a man communicating that on stage			0
i think that is very , very powerful			0
perhaps even more than when i see him jump and being strong physically			0
" beyond ' @entity118 ' despite the phenomenal strength needed to be a ballet dancer , there remains a perception of it , at least in the @entity82 , as a woman 's profession -- but this is changing , says @entity25			1
" i went to the opening night of @entity118 the musical , " he explained			1
" some of the stories that are told are so true and it is more common than you can imagine			0
" " people might think of beautiful ballerinas on pointe shoes and in tutus but dance in general , at least in @entity66 , is the second most popular activity in schools after football -- so it is not true that men do n't dance			2
" and if @entity25 has his way , we 'll be seeing a lot more of them taking center stage in the future			2
watch : @entity148 -- from the barrio to the ballet learn : @entity153 ballerina 's grace under pressure			0
