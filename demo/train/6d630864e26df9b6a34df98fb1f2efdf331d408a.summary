in the midst of the color debate , there 's one thing the @entity5 does seem to agree upon			1
that dress is not cute			2
whether folks were team white and gold or team blue and black , the common consensus across social media seemed to be that it is far from the height of fashion			0
@entity15 has attempted to explain the science behind the debate that has split us all			1
the battle , it says , " is about more than just social media -- it 's about primal biology and the way human eyes and brains have evolved to see color in a sunlit world			1
" " @entity28 enters the eye through the lens -- different wavelengths corresponding to different colors , " writes @entity15 's @entity27			1
" the light hits the retina in the back of the eye where pigments fire up neural connections to the visual cortex , the part of the brain that processes those signals into an image			0
" usually this process works fine , @entity27 writes , but the image of this particular dress is " some kind of perceptual boundary			2
" " what 's happening here is your visual system is looking at this thing , and you 're trying to discount the chromatic bias of the daylight axis , " @entity49 , a neuroscientist who studies color and vision at @entity52 , told @entity15			1
" so people either discount the blue side , in which case they end up seeing white and gold , or discount the gold side , in which case they end up with blue and black			0
" for the record , @entity49 sees blue and black when he looks at the dress			0
according to @entity70 , the frock can be purchased for $ 77 from the @entity72 site @entity73			0
@entity70 also collected some of the best @entity76 reviews , including one that simply read , " this dress is why i have trust issues			0

the @entity5 is arguing over a dress color
some think it 's just plain ugly
@entity15 has tried to explain *reactions* scientifically
