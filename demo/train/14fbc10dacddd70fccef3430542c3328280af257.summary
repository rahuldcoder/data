-- journalism and national security have survived decades of lies ; both can handle a little unexpected truth			1
giving government secrets and classified documents to a nation 's enemies or even its allies is certainly against the law			1
we 've always called it spying			1
now the equation is changed and people who approve giving purloined documents to the wide electronic world call it transparency			0
others , who oppose @entity21 ' release of diplomatic cables sunday , are calling it an act of terrorism to be met with full government sanctions			1
the sober side of me knows that putting the entire archive of a quarter - million @entity31 documents online can be harmful and potentially dangerous for national security			1
yet the news reader -- the citizen -- in me also finds it immensely satisfying to learn what government leaders are really saying compared with the official statements , releases and communiqu√©s that often masquerade as government information			2
knowing that @entity42 leaders , behind a false front of regional solidarity , are fretting about @entity45 seems a bit refreshing			0
i do appreciate knowing that our @entity47 knows that an @entity50 vice president visited the @entity51 last year carrying $ 52 million in cash			0
even if i feel chagrined that our diplomats are getting blackmailed by other nations into taking @entity56 prisoners off our hands , i 'd rather know the truth than the pretend explanations			0
the real danger , it seems to me , is not the revelation of assorted classified material but our tendency to overreact , either to actual security threats such as the shoe bomber and the underwear bomber or , in this case , to a massive information dump			2
we 've become so reactive to security concerns -- and , at the same time , apathetic to threats to our own civil liberties -- that we might , as a result of the @entity21 release , allow government agencies to step on the universal reach of the @entity77 or find ways to create exceptions to @entity81 freedoms			1
official ire may be aimed at @entity21 and its founder , but there 's a real current of anger at the media for providing a printed and organized outlet for these documents			1
without the printed media , however , the information would be presented in such a helter - skelter fashion , it would be difficult to analyze or even know what is true and which documents are bogus			0
since the earlier two massive releases by @entity21 of low - level @entity98 documents relating to the wars in @entity50 and @entity101 , i have yet to find a person who has actually read more than a tiny sampling of the actual leaked documents			2
many say the electronic information age has done away with traditional or mainstream journalism , but here it is evident that the journalists at the @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity114 's @entity113 magazine and the @entity116 daily @entity115 are still doing the legwork -- sifting through information , confirming , editing and presenting it to the public			2
over many weeks , the above publications have also cooperated with their governments and with @entity21 in vetting the material and removing information that clearly might be harmful to people in other countries			2
we all understand how illegal it is to reveal state secrets , even those that are classified secret for no good reason			0
we also know that over the years , governments have lied to the @entity136 people in the name of national security , whether about preparations for war or dealings with our allies and enemies			1
journalists take comfort in the saying about sunlight being the best disinfectant , and usually that is true			0
@entity150 expressed the same sentiment this way : " let the people know the facts and the country will be safe			0
" i know there is risk in having these illegally obtained insights into government discussions and calculations , but we should not allow others to use this to attack a free media or to create more government secrecy			1
during a conversation with my journalism class on the @entity21 controversy yesterday , the graduate students considered both overreactions as potential dangers -- that these leaks will provide an excuse to curtail our constitutional freedoms and that government will become even more duplicitous			1
and that would be a real crime			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180			0

@entity180 says journalism , national security survived lies , will survive @entity21 truth
he says he 's uneasy that what used to be called spying is now " transparency "
still , he says , we should not use @entity21 to attack free media , increase government secrecy
@entity180 : *filter* of news media for @entity21 dump was *crucial* to *responsible* presentation
