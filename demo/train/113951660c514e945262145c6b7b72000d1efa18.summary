@entity0 -- @entity3 leaders , using a new strategy , will return thursday to the @entity5 in their latest bid to garner enhanced international recognition			1
after its failed bid to win @entity0 recognition as an independent state , the @entity8 is seeking non-member observer state status , one step up from its current status as a permanent observer			1
@entity8 leaders have been working with dozens of supporting nations to put together the wording of a formal draft of a resolution			0
among those on board are @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			0
opinion : why @entity31 , @entity30 should welcome @entity3 move at @entity0 the @entity31 and the @entity33 oppose the effort , arguing that the only real solution to the conflict will come when @entity3 and @entity30 return to the bargaining table			1
" i have said many times that the path to a two - state solution that fulfills the aspirations of the @entity3 people is through @entity45 and @entity46 , and not @entity47 , " secretary of state @entity38 told reporters wednesday afternoon			1
@entity48 said it will abstain from the vote			0
the renewed effort comes a year after a more ambitious full statehood bid died because it would not get a majority of votes on the @entity54			1
@entity8 president @entity55 told supporters in @entity46 in the @entity57 that the resolution , which many observers call symbolic , " is the first step to achieve all our national @entity3 rights			1
" if approved , the new status would place the @entity3 in the same category as the @entity65			2
@entity30 government spokesman @entity66 called the move " political theater			2
" read more : @entity70 conflict leaves a ' cruel paradox ' for @entity3 " the @entity3 can get a piece of paper from the @entity0 , but they are not going to get a state because @entity3 statehood can only be achieved through negotiations with @entity30 , " @entity66 said			1
@entity3 leaders argue they have the right to go to the @entity0 because @entity30 failed to comply with agreements it signed more than 20 years ago			1
the last round of negotiations with @entity30 and the @entity8 was in 2010			2
" it 's about a contract			0
our contract is that in five years we should have concluded the treaty of peace and all core issues			0
this did not happen , and we 're talking about 20 years later			0
and going to the @entity0 is not a unilateral step , " @entity8 chief negotiator @entity90 said in september			0
the new status would eliminate @entity30 justifications for building settlements in the disputed areas of @entity45 and the @entity57 , according to @entity90			2
opinion : @entity3 move at @entity0 wo n't solve anything @entity1 's @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 contributed to this report .			0
