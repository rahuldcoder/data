@entity0 -- in a dramatic slap at congressional authority , a divided @entity2 has struck down a key part of a law that denies to legally married same - sex couples the same federal benefits provided to heterosexual spouses			2
the @entity10 defines marriage as only between a man and a woman			2
the vote wednesday was 5 - 4			1
" although @entity17 has great authority to design laws to fit its own conception of sound national policy , it can not deny the liberty protected by the @entity24 of the @entity25 , " said justice @entity15			1
he was supported by four more liberal colleagues : justices @entity27 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			0
read the ruling the case examined whether the federal government can deny tax , health and pension benefits to same - sex couples in states where they can legally marry			1
at issue was whether @entity10 violates equal protection guarantees in the @entity25 's due process clause as applied to same - sex couples legally married under the laws of their states			1
the key plaintiff is @entity49 , 84 , who married fellow @entity51 resident @entity49 in @entity52 in 2007 , about 40 years into their relationship			2
by the time @entity56 died in 2009 , @entity51 courts recognized same - sex marriages performed in other countries			0
but the federal government did n't recognize @entity49 's same - sex marriage , and she was forced to assume an estate tax bill much larger than those that other married couples would have to pay			1
so , @entity49 sued the federal government			1
a federal appeals court last year ruled in @entity49 's favor , saying @entity10 violated the @entity70 's equal protection clause			1
" today 's @entity10 ruling is a historic step forward for # @entity73			1
# @entity78 , " president @entity76 's official @entity75 account posted soon after the decision was handed down			1
@entity15 , in his opinion , used sweeping language to affirm the rights of gays and lesbians			0
" for same - sex couples who wished to be married , the state ( of @entity51 ) acted to give their lawful conduct a lawful status			0
this status is a far - reaching legal acknowledgment of the intimate relationship between two people , a relationship deemed by the state worthy of dignity in the community equal with all other marriages , " he said			2
" @entity10 seeks to injure the very class @entity51 seeks to protect			2
" but @entity15 -- a moderate - conservative who proved once again to be the " swing , " or deciding , vote -- made clear the ruling is limited : " this opinion and its holding are confined to those lawful marriages			0
" thirty - five states have laws banning same - sex marriage			0
key quotes from the ruling under @entity10 , @entity111 , pension and bankruptcy benefits , along with family medical leave protections and other federal provisions , did not apply to gay and lesbian couples legally married in states that recognize such unions			1
in a thunderous dissent , read from the bench , justice @entity120 slammed the majority for its " exalted conception of the role of this institution " -- the @entity2 -- " in @entity127			1
" " few public controversies touch an institution so central to the lives of so many , and few inspire such attendant passion by good people on both sides , " he said			0
" few public controversies will ever demonstrate so vividly the beauty of what our ( @entity70 ) framers gave us , a gift the court pawns today to buy its stolen moment in the spotlight : a system of government that permits us to rule ourselves			2
" @entity120 added , " some will rejoice in today 's decision , and some will despair at it ; that is the nature of a controversy that matters so much to so many			1
but the court has cheated both sides , robbing the winners of an honest victory , and the losers of the peace that comes from a fair defeat			2
we owed both of them better			0
" chief justice @entity159 and justices @entity160 and @entity162 also dissented			0
@entity49 was in @entity51 when the ruling came down			2
she told reporters that she was overjoyed			0
" we won everything we asked and hoped for			0
wow , " she said			0
" i 'm honored and humbled and overjoyed to be here today to represent not only the thousands of @entity127 whose lives have been adversely impacted by the @entity10 , but those whose hopes and dreams have been constricted by the same discriminatory law			1
" marrying for the benefits @entity49 thanked the supporters who cheered her on throughout the case			0
" because of today 's @entity2 ruling , the federal government can no longer discriminate against the marriages of gay and lesbian @entity127			1
children born today will grow up in a world without @entity10 , and those same children who happen to be gay will be free to love and get married as @entity181 and i did , but with the same federal benefits , protections and dignity as everyone else , " @entity49 said			1
" if i had to survive @entity181 , what a glorious way to do it			0
and she would be so pleased			0
" the defense of marriage law was defended in the high court by @entity189 , after @entity76 concluded the law was unconstitutional			1
traditionally , that role would fall to the solicitor general 's office			0
but president ordered attorney general @entity195 not to defend @entity10 in court			1
that raised the question of whether any party could rightfully step in and defend the law			0
by striking down the @entity10 provision , the court decided the standing question was not at play in this case , and it had jurisdiction to decide the larger questions			2
a bill known as the @entity209 is working its way through @entity17 and would repeal @entity10			2
that law does not prohibit states from allowing same - sex marriages , but it also does not force states to recognize such marriages performed in other states			0
most of the current plaintiffs are federal workers , who are not allowed to add their spouses to health care plans and other benefits			0
after historic rulings , what 's next ? the case is @entity127 v. @entity49 ( 12 - 307 ) .			1

new : @entity49 , who sued the federal government , says she is overjoyed by the ruling
in a 5 - 4 decision , the high court says @entity17 can not deny equal protection
" today 's @entity10 ruling is a historic step forward , " president 's *twitter* account posts
