-- i believe it was december of ' 98 when my dad passed away of an overdose			1
a few weeks later , around my 10th birthday , i was diagnosed with tourette syndrome and @entity8 's syndrome			1
it was a really rough time , especially at that age , being told i have a neurological " disease , " when i already felt so different			2
at that point i was being bullied for being different , having big ears , and now for having no dad and for making weird faces and noises i could n't control			1
i was a walking target			2
then my mom discovered a musical interest in me after my older sister was in musical theater at her high school			1
i learned all the songs from the show " @entity26 " and at the final performance , the director let me go onstage ( my first time onstage ) and perform with the cast ! i was hooked instantly and for some reason it felt right			2
although i felt i had found " my place , " i still had to go back to my own school			1
the bullying just kept getting worse			2
i did n't know what to do anymore			2
i remember i even had thoughts of suicide and hurting myself			2
when i turned 12 , i was given a hand - me - down guitar and a chord book			2
i studied those basic chords and learned how to play the basic songs			2
throughout this process , i figured out that no matter how bad of a day i had at school , i could come home and create my own world within the music			1
i could make the music as happy or as sad as i wanted it to be			0
i used the pain from being bullied to transform me into who i was meant to be			1
i knew where i was most comfortable -- on stage			0
but i could n't always be there , and not everyone respected my happiness			0
durbin on ' dr. @entity56 ' the bullying did n't end there			0
it got so bad that i dropped out of high school			1
i got to the point where i could n't even focus in class because of the pestering			0
i told the school officials about the bullying and they did what they could , but i would rather be sitting on my butt at home than being bullied and beat up at school			1
a couple of years later , i met an angel who would turn out to be my beautiful wife , @entity75 i was a dropout : no job , no license , no car , no aspirations			1
she had a diploma , three jobs , a car and goals			0
having someone in my life who really believed in me made me believe in myself			0
we started dating , and i started to progress			0
i started a band and found a job , got my license , and soon afterward got my ged			0
in the midst of it all , we found out that we were expecting our sweet son @entity95			0
that right there is the proudest moment of my life and no famous game show or extravaganza concert can top that			0
@entity75 and @entity95 balance me			1
through my adventures and heartache on " @entity105 , " to the adventures and heartache on the road of rock ' n roll , they have always supported me			1
and when i 'm home , i 'm just daddy			0
with whatever " celebrity status " i have thanks to " @entity105 , " i really want to use it for a good purpose			1
i 've always been a huge fan of @entity116 and pro wrestling			0
i was approached by them after " idol " to be a part of their anti-bullying campaign @entity123			0
since then i have participated in several in - school rallies to talk to kids about my experiences being bullied and how i 've overcome them to be the man i am today			1
regrets ? i 've had a few ... but then again , too few to mention , haha .			0
