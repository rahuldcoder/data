at least 12 people were killed and 91 others were injured in clashes around the country 's second - largest city , @entity1 state news agency @entity12 said friday , citing local hospitals			1
retired @entity1 gen. @entity21 , who participated in the 2011 rebellion that ousted dictator @entity23 , launched the attack that supporters said was an attempt to clear the city of extremist groups , @entity20 affiliate @entity19 reported			1
the @entity1 government and the military command in @entity31 reacted with alarm , saying that they did n't order the attack , and that the operation -- which they conceded included some @entity1 soldiers -- amounted to a " coup			1
" that such a force could mount an attack without the government 's blessing underscores the difficulty that @entity31 -- more than 400 miles to the west -- has had in trying to influence a dire situation in @entity11 , where @entity9 groups have been blamed for near daily assassinations , bombings and kidnappings against security forces			1
a @entity1 air force plane and 120 military vehicles took part in the unauthorized operation against the militants , acting prime minister @entity55 said on @entity1 state - run tv			1
residents of @entity11 , meanwhile , told @entity20 that they saw more than one military plane overhead friday			0
it was n't clear how many of the operation 's fighters were members of the @entity65 country 's military			0

@entity21 was in exile in the @entity85 until he returned for the 2011 rebellion			0
in recent months , @entity87 toured cities in eastern @entity1 , promising some kind of military offensive to purge @entity11 -- the cradle of the 2011 revolution against @entity23 -- of @entity9 extremist groups			2
@entity87 's overtures came amid rising frustration in @entity11 that @entity31 has n't been able to staunch radical @entity9 militant groups ' presence and influence , which has been rising since the revolution			0
residents and officials have blamed the violence that has gripped @entity11 on groups including @entity104			0
the @entity85 designated that group a terrorist organization this year , and has accused it of being involved in the 2012 attack that killed four @entity85 -- including ambassador @entity108 -- at a @entity85 diplomatic compound in @entity11			0
official @entity1 security forces have struggled to deal with hostile militias , so the government has relied on other militias , many on the state 's payroll , in an attempt to enhance security			2
but various other political forces also have relied on militias , leaving the country awash in armed groups -- many who refused to disband after the revolution -- with competing agendas and loyalties			0
@entity126 called on government - sanctioned militias friday to " practice self - restraint " and keep abiding by the @entity131 's orders , " the government calls on the people in the capital of the revolution , @entity11 , to be calm and ( to ) support the legitimacy of the ... revolution and its police and army , " @entity55 said on state tv			2
