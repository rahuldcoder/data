-- a @entity2 subsidiary of a @entity4 - based multinational firm pleaded guilty in federal court thursday to illegally sending software to @entity7 , which it used in the development of its first advanced attack helicopter , according to the @entity4 attorney in @entity13			1
@entity14 -- a subsidiary of @entity15 , @entity13 - based @entity16 -- pleaded guilty to violating the @entity17			1
in a case going back more than a decade , the firm admitted it sold software that was used in the development and testing of the new z - 10 helicopter for @entity7 's army			1
@entity16 , @entity14 and another @entity16 subsidiary -- @entity26 -- agreed to pay more than $ 75 million as part of a settlement with the @entity4 government because of the arms export violations and for making false statements , according to a statement from @entity4 attorney @entity33 and other federal officials			1
the firms are expected to pay $ 20.7 million to the @entity37 and another $ 55 million to the @entity38 " to resolve outstanding export issues , including those related to the @entity41 , " court documents said			1
" this prosecution is one of the largest resolutions of export violations with a major defense contractor in the @entity37 's history , " @entity33 said			0
federal officials blasted the firm , saying the case " is a clear example of how the illegal export of sensitive technology reduces the advantages our military currently possesses			2
" " @entity4 military prowess depends on lawful , controlled exports of sensitive technology by @entity4 industries and their subsidiaries , " added @entity57 , director of @entity58 ( @entity58 )			2
according to court documents , an internal e-mail from a senior manager in september 2001 suggested that officials at @entity14 knew the sales could violate @entity4 sanctions			1
" we must be very careful that the helicopter programs we are doing with the @entity7 are not presented or viewed as military programs , " the manager 's e-mail read , according to the documents			2
" as a result of these sanctions , we need to be very careful with the @entity78 program			0
if the first flight will be with a gun ship then we could have problems with the @entity4 government			0
" the contractor was allegedly trying to outflank its @entity86 rivals and develop a foothold in the lucrative @entity7 civil helicopter market , thought to be worth up to $ 2 billion in the coming years , the documents added			1
an internal briefing from september 2002 noted that " @entity7 's civil helicopter market potential is large ( estimated at close to 20,000 aircraft by some )			2
" @entity7 officials allegedly " made it clear that if ( @entity14 ) wanted to have its engines considered for the yet - to - be - developed civil version , it would have to provide its engines ... with the understanding that the initial application ... would be military , " the documents added			1
but the firm allegedly " turned a blind eye to the attack helicopter application and went along with the ' sudden appearance ' of a parallel civil program			1
" @entity16 says it accepted responsibility " for these past violations and we deeply regret they occurred , " noting that it has " invested more than $ 30 million since 2006 to strengthen its compliance infrastructure			2
" " export controls are an integral part of safeguarding @entity4 national security and foreign policy interests , " said ceo @entity112			0
" as a supplier of controlled products and technologies to the @entity120 and other domestic and international customers , we are committed to conducting business in full compliance with all export laws and regulations			0
" the @entity4 has imposed sanctions on the sale of military technology to @entity7 since 1989 , after pro-democracy protests in @entity131 's @entity130 were crushed in a bloody @entity7 crackdown			1
@entity133 strengthened sanctions less than a year later , specifically naming helicopters and helicopter parts in the ban			0
the z - 10 helicopter is in production and started being used by @entity7 's armed forces in 2009 , according to the @entity37			0
it is capable of being equipped with 30 mm cannons , anti-tank and air - to - air missiles , and is primarily intended as an anti-armor attack craft , according to federal officials			0
@entity147 , a senior adviser at the @entity148 , said the case " highlights our issues with defense cooperation and competition with @entity7			0
" " this is just another signal that those issues and tensions are unlikely to go anywhere , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity158 contributed to this report .			0
