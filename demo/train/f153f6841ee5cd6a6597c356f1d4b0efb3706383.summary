@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity5 called @entity1 's prime minister thursday to push a proposed nuclear partnership that sparked an unsuccessful no - confidence vote against the @entity1 leader this week , a @entity4 spokesman said			1
prime minister @entity10 won a confidence vote despite opposition to the nuclear deal			1
" both leaders expressed their desire to see the @entity18 - @entity1 civil nuclear issue move forward as expeditiously as possible , " @entity14 said			2
the phone call took place two days after @entity1 prime minister @entity10 narrowly survived the no - confidence vote in the lower house of @entity23			1
the vote was sparked by concerns from the opposition that @entity1 was kowtowing to the @entity18 the tentative deal was announced in 2006 and signed by @entity5 and @entity10 a year ago			1
under the agreement , which will need to be approved by the @entity29 , @entity1 would have access to @entity18 nuclear fuel and technology for its civilian nuclear power plants			1
that would happen even though @entity0 , which tested nuclear weapons in 1974 and 1998 , has declined to join international non-proliferation agreements			0
in return , @entity1 has promised that it would not transfer the fuel and equipment to its weapons program , and it would allow the @entity41 to inspect at least 14 of its 22 nuclear plants			0
the plan would also expand @entity18 - @entity1 cooperation in energy and satellite technology			0
the plan was approved by @entity1 's @entity48 last year , and does not have to be ratified by the parliament			2
the leaders of @entity1 's two communist parties -- which hold about 60 seats in @entity23 -- have accused @entity10 of surrendering @entity1 's sovereignty to the @entity18 with the deal			1
a no - confidence vote would have forced @entity10 to resign , and required the government to hold early elections unless a new coalition could have been formed			2
the @entity60 - led coalition has governed @entity1 since 2004			0
tuesday 's 275 - 256 vote was so crucial to the survival of @entity10 's government that five members of parliament serving prison sentences were freed to cast votes -- under the watchful eyes of their jailers			1
shortly after @entity10 survived the vote , @entity4 spokeswoman @entity69 praised the deal as " a good one for everybody			0
" " it 's good for @entity1 because it would help provide them a source for energy that they need , one that is nonpolluting and one that does n't emit greenhouse gas emissions , " she said			0
" and we think that we can move forward with this			0
if their legislature lets it move forward , then we can do the same here and then we 'll be able to get this wrapped up			0
