an arm , legs , underwear , dark jeans and size 5Â½ @entity5 sneakers turned up on the @entity8 side of the @entity9			1
the jeans and shoes were the same size of @entity13 , an autistic 14 - year - old last seen last fall walking unsupervised out of his school			1
yet his mother was steadfast : " it 's not avonte until it 's @entity13			1
" that time has come			0
on tuesday -- five days after those body parts and scraps of clothing were found -- @entity25 learned that dna tests proved her son 's remains indeed had been found			1
her lawyer said that @entity25 has been stoic , strong , focused and hopeful throughout this ordeal			1
but after police told her the news on tuesday , " she finally just broke down ... just crying and crying			0
" " i kept saying , @entity36 , say it again , " @entity33 said of his muddled phone conversation			0
to which she replied through the tears , " it 's @entity13 , it 's @entity13			1
( the police ) came			0
" so ended not just her family 's search for the teenager , but that of the @entity48 ' most populated city			2
police deployed sniffer dogs , combed surveillance footage and repeatedly canvassed each of @entity54 's 468 subway stations because of @entity13 's love of trains			1
missing teen 's fascination with trains shifts search the most poignant , most personal part of the search was @entity25 's recorded voice that was broadcast from patrol cars and other search vehicles			1
@entity13 could n't communicate verbally and had the mental capacity of a 7 - or 8 - year - old			1
but @entity25 hoped that he would hear her and head toward a police car 's flashing lights to safety			2
" avonte , this is your mother , " the recording said			2
" still , while the hunt for @entity13 is over , the saga is not			2
for one , funeral services for the teen still have to be planned			2
and admitting he personally is " good and angry , " @entity33 reeled off a number of accusations against the @entity83 ( also known as the @entity84 ) in the @entity86 section of @entity8			0
they included questions such as : why did it take " several minutes " for @entity13 's teacher to notice he was n't in class ? why did it take 15 minutes for school administrators to find out ? why were police in a neighborhood precinct not alerted for about an hour ? hinting that the family will sue the city , @entity33 said videotapes he 's seen suggested " sheer chaos " in a school that he contends is not safe			1
" i am convinced , in my heart of hearts , that had a prompt reaction occurred , had some of this cascade of errors not occurred , that the police would have been called , they would have went outside , and they would have found @entity110 before this happened , " @entity33 said			1
" he would be home right now			0
he would be wearing his @entity5 , and they would n't have been found in a river			0
" massive hunt for missing teen a message from @entity117 left with the school 's dean on tuesday night was not immediately returned			1
when such allegations were made previously , the school had declined to comment , while the @entity54 @entity122 had said that it was cooperating with police			1
what has been established from official accounts is that at 12:38 p.m. on october 4 , surveillance video showed @entity110 leaving his school for children with learning disabilities			1
given @entity110 's condition , he should have had a monitor at all times			0
but the video indicated he was alone			0
about three hours later , bloodhounds traced his scent to a marsh near his school but lost the trail , a source close to the investigation said			0
they picked up his scent again an hour later , this time at a nearby subway station			0
but while the dogs might have picked up his scent , they could n't find @entity13			2
the search , though , did n't end that day			0
@entity54 police at one point devoted 50 officers and a task force of detectives to the case , according to then - police commissioner @entity152			2
the @entity153 had its workers check each of its facilities each morning			0
the @entity158 brought in special cameras extended on poles to search the sewer system in and around the area where @entity13 went missing , the source said			2
and @entity110 's family pressed their case with the media and the public , even after @entity152 said later in october that " unfortunately , we are not hopeful that we 're going to find this young man alive			1
" " my message to my son is that i love him , and we 're going to find him , " she told @entity117 's @entity170			0
" you 'll come home to your family			0
and for anyone who has him , please be kind and to let him go			0
" @entity54 police losing hope ; not @entity110 's mom it was n't just his family who kept working and maintained hope , @entity33 said			1
so , too , did many @entity54 who participated in the search or , at the least , kept their eyes out for @entity13 , helped by the fliers and posters that blanketed the city			1
said @entity33 : " i do n't remember a search in the city of @entity54 that rose to this level			2
it was a beautiful sight			0
" body parts , clothes found in @entity9 whatever the outcome , @entity110 's family laid the groundwork to sue @entity54 's government days after he went missing			1
they filed a claim -- the first step in a lawsuit -- over what they described as " the negligence , carelessness and / or recklessness " of those who 'd been charged with watching @entity13 that day			1
then came last week 's discovery of clothes that matched those worn by the slim , approximately 5 - foot , 3 - inch teenager , as well as the remains			1
lawyer : police checking on remains the fact they were found in the @entity9 also jibed with a possible storyline , given the @entity83 's location near the water around where the @entity223 goes to and from @entity225			1
the matching clothes were not enough for @entity25 and company			0
" they were n't going to accept anything else but @entity231 , " her lawyer said			0
and @entity231 , ultimately , proved that the remains indeed belonged to @entity13			2
so how and when did @entity110 die ? the medical examiner has n't issued a public ruling , though the gory state of the teenager 's remains leaves open an alarming array of possibilities			0
@entity33 said he does n't know if foul play is to blame , whether the fact the boy was found in pieces stems from natural decomposition in the water or something more gruesome			0
" you know what they say , you put 10 people in a room you get 12 opinions , " the lawyer said of the diverse range of theories as to what happened .			0

@entity13 's mother was hopeful until the very end , her lawyer says
he says @entity13 would be alive if not for " cascade of errors " at school he 'd attended
