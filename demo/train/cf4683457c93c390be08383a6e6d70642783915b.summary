-- @entity1 , @entity2 , mayor @entity3 is again embroiled in a controversy over redevelopment in her community			1
the first one helped get her elected mayor			0
the second has added fuel to the fire of scandal consuming the administration of gov. @entity15 , a possible presidential candidate			2
the stakes are high and @entity3 's right in the middle of it with her allegations the administration conditioned @entity23 relief money for her town to her support for a redevelopment project proposed by a company with ties to @entity15			1
@entity3 was a little - known @entity29 president when she stepped in as its first female mayor in 2009 after @entity32 was arrested in a pay - to - play scheme			1
he was convicted on federal charges and jailed			0
she made her mark in local politics working to stop a high - rise redevelopment plan , a controversy that played out in court			2
a @entity40 , the wife of a diamond manufacturing executive , and the mother of two children , @entity3 was reelected in november			0
@entity45 paint her as one of many partisan opportunists seeking to derail @entity15 , who appeals to both @entity45 and @entity49 voters in traditionally " blue " @entity2			1
her allegations have added a new dimension to allegations of hardball politics gone awry in @entity2 under the leadership of @entity15 , hailed by many in his own party , and some @entity49 , as a straight - shooter and a refreshing change from scripted politics			1
but it 's true , " @entity3 told @entity0 's @entity60 on " @entity61 " sunday of her claims that lt. gov. @entity63 told her in a parking lot in may that @entity23 funds were conditioned on her support for the redevelopment project			1
@entity69 said her dispatch is " a direct message from the governor , " @entity3 said			0
the allegations , denied by @entity74 , are the first time an official has connected @entity15 directly to recent controversies plaguing his administration			2
@entity1 mayor : ' it 's true ' @entity15 administration withheld @entity23 funds the turn of events is quite something considering she once tweeted during the @entity23 aftermath that she was " very glad governor @entity15 has been our gov. " after @entity23 , @entity1 was about 80 % underwater			1
as mayor , @entity3 pleaded for relief and was dismayed when her city received only about $ 300,000 of the roughly $ 100 million in state funds the city requested for flood prevention			2
@entity15 spokesman @entity95 told @entity0 that @entity3 asked for $ 100 million from a roughly $ 300 million pot of money for which there was $ 14 billion worth of requests			1
@entity2 official calls mayor 's @entity15 allegations ' false ' since that request , @entity95 said @entity1 has been approved for nearly $ 70 million in aid			1
the city has also been identified as a pilot community for a federal program to prevent flooding , one of only four such projects in @entity2			0
@entity3 , however , had a different account of allocated funds			0
she said the $ 70 million given to @entity1 was through flood insurance and other mechanisms that did not need approval from the state			0
she received only $ 300,000 in @entity15 - approved funds , she said			0
@entity3 's comments saturday and sunday are also a change from what she told @entity0 the previous week , when she said that while she wondered whether @entity23 aid funds were being withheld because she did n't endorse the governor 's re-election , she concluded that " i do n't think that 's the case			1
" " i do n't think it was retaliation and i do n't have any reason to think it 's retaliation , but i 'm not satisfied with the amount of money i 've gotten so far , " @entity3 told @entity0 at the time , not mentioning her concerns about the redevelopment project			2
but sunday morning , @entity3 told @entity0 's @entity60 that she did n't speak out before because she did n't think anyone would believe her , adding that she is now " offering to testify under oath			0
" @entity0 's @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 mayor @entity3 's at the center of political controversy again
@entity3 claims @entity15 administration conditioned @entity23 aid on support for project
@entity45 say @entity3 is playing partisan politics , betraying @entity15
@entity3 says she 's just *fighting* for her water - *logged* town
