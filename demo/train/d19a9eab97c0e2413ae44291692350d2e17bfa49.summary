-- @entity2 's 218 public schools will open on time in september after mayor @entity3 assured the school district on thursday it will receive $ 50 million that superintendent @entity5 demanded last week			1
@entity5 gave the city an ultimatum , saying the school district would not open on time if it did not receive a funding guarantee by friday			1
this came after the layoff of close to 3,800 employees this summer due to a " drastic financial shortfall			0
" the massive layoffs included aides , assistant principals , social workers and arts teachers			0
" i 'm here to say i will not risk a catastrophe , " @entity3 said thursday , " we will avoid this disaster			0
" @entity3 directed the city finance director , the city treasurer , and the budget director on thursday to begin immediately taking all steps necessary for the city to borrow $ 50 million on behalf of the school district , @entity3 said in a written statement			1
@entity5 said he plans to open the schools on time based on @entity3 's assurance , even though @entity3 has not yet cut a deal with @entity34 over how it will be funded			1
the superintendent expressed his appreciation to the mayor in a statement released thursday , saying that the funding promise will allow the district to immediately start recalling the necessary staff to open the schools on time			2
@entity5 had previously said that without the money to restore crucial staff members , the district would not be able to open " functional schools , run them responsibly , or provide a quality education to students			2
" @entity3 had called @entity5 's ultimatum one of " the most chilling " statements he had ever heard a school superintendent make , but promised he would stand " shoulder to shoulder " with @entity5 and would not allow schools to open with no more staff than he could afford without the extra money			1
@entity5 and @entity3 had previously urged the @entity34 to extend a 1 % sales tax to make up the difference but -- despite approval from the @entity60 and @entity62 gov. @entity61 -- city council president @entity63 said he would rather focus that money on the city 's critical pension problem			2
if the city does not solve the retirement fund issues , @entity63 said , @entity2 could quickly follow in the footsteps of other major cities with significant financial problems			0
as an alternative , @entity63 proposed the city purchase the school district 's surplus vacant real estate for $ 50 million and sell the property to developers who could turn it into potential job producers			1
a final decision on this proposal has not yet been made			0
@entity5 and @entity3 are also negotiating a contract with the local teachers ' union , hoping to save money by asking teachers to make concessions on certain benefits			0
because there has been no agreement with the union , $ 45 million in aid from the state previously allocated to the school district is being withheld			0
once the negotiations are complete the funding will be released , state budget secretary @entity94 said tuesday			0
@entity3 said that " as mayor , it 's my duty to keep @entity2 on track and moving forward and that 's what i 'm doing today			2
" @entity2 's 218 public schools will now open their doors on september 9 , the originally scheduled date .			1
