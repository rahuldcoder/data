@entity0 -- president @entity2 tore into the @entity4 opposition on @entity5 wednesday , blaming the @entity4 for what he called politically motivated opposition on virtually every issue			1
@entity9 have been willing to incorporate @entity4 ideas on health care and other issues , he said , but republicans have not been willing to do the same			1
addressing a gathering of @entity9 , @entity2 promised to " call ( @entity4 ) out when ( @entity9 ) extend a hand and get a fist in return			1
" several democrats facing tough election fights this november were given time to ask the president questions on high - profile issues such as trade and deficit reduction			2
much of the president 's time , however , was used to lash out at @entity4 tactics			1
@entity28 , he said , have tried to employ the filibuster more over the past year than in all of the 1950s and 1960s combined			1
the @entity4 's strategy has been " 20 years of obstruction packed into one , " he said			1
" if you want to govern , you ca n't just say no , " he argued			0
" it ca n't be about just scoring points			0
" the filibuster , he added , only works as intended if there is a " genuine spirit of compromise			0
" the president 's tough rhetoric was part of a more aggressive -- and frequently populist -- @entity44 strategy in the wake of the @entity9 ' recent upset loss in the @entity48 race			1
@entity4 sen. - elect @entity50 's victory stripped @entity9 of their 60 - seat @entity48 supermajority and raised fears among many congressional democrats about a potential @entity4 landslide in the upcoming midterm elections			1
the @entity57 answer to the @entity48 race should not be " to do nothing " in @entity59 , he said			1
nervous constituents want to see legislative progress , he asserted			0
" we should do more , and we should do so without delay , " he said			0
in recent days -- during a meeting with @entity44 @entity28 in @entity65 and in town hall forums in @entity67 and @entity68 -- @entity2 has repeatedly offered to work with @entity4 leaders			1
at the same time , he has been ratcheting up his own partisan rhetoric			0
" by extending an olive branch to @entity28 , the president appears to be attempting to appeal to independent voters who have flocked to the @entity4 over the past several months , " @entity1 deputy political director @entity71 said			1
" but the president also needs to rally a deflated and angry @entity57 base , which accounts in part for his tougher attacks against @entity4 leaders			2
" @entity2 cited several examples of what he said was @entity4 legislative maneuvering motivated purely by political considerations			1
among other things , he raised the recent example of seven @entity4 senators who backed a bill establishing a bipartisan deficit reduction commission , but then turned against it when the proposal came to a vote			2
he also noted that a large number of bills have been subjected to @entity4 - led filibusters , only to receive 85 or 90 votes once the filibuster is broken and the legislation is allowed to move to a final vote			2
i 'm " not open to switches " solely " because it 's good short - term politics , " he said			0
i wo n't tolerate an " if you lose , i win " mentality			0
@entity2 urged @entity48 @entity9 to stop listening to what he called politically oriented cable television shows on networks such as @entity106 , @entity1 and @entity107 , and instead get out of the @entity0 " echo chamber			1
" most people " do n't care about majorities and minorities and process , " he said			0
they just want to know if their elected representatives are " delivering for me			0
" the president warned fellow @entity9 that the public is often misinformed on key issues such as budget deficits			2
many constituents will cite foreign aid or legislative earmarks when discussing ways to reduce spending , he said , when in reality those items constitute a minuscule share of federal spending			0
balancing the budget while refusing to raise taxes and exempting entitlement programs such as @entity131 and @entity132 would require 60 percent cuts in virtually every other program , and " that 's just not going to happen , " he said			0
noting that @entity136 left office with budget surpluses , @entity2 asserted that @entity9 " should have credibility " on the deficit issue			2
but the party is " still haunted " by debates from the 1960s and ' 70s when the party was stuck with the " tax and spend " label , he said			0
@entity1 's @entity147 and @entity148 contributed to this report .			0
