we have no details to say whether or not this particular one is a good idea			0
" @entity4 issued a statement wednesday that suggested @entity7 family unity was essential for the movie to be made			1
" the purpose of making a movie about the life of dr. @entity7 is to tell a great story which could bridge distances and bring people together , " the statement said			2
" we remain committed to pursuing a film chronicling @entity7 's life provided that there is unity in the family so we can make a film about unity in our nation			1
" @entity4 executives appeared caught by surprise by the @entity85 's infighting , although such squabbles are not new -- @entity7 and @entity35 filed a lawsuit against @entity29 last year over publication of their mother 's recently discovered love letters			1
@entity7 and @entity35 have complained in court filings that @entity29 has acted independently for years on estate business matters , refusing to call a family meeting			2

@entity29 , in a written statement wednesday evening , said he has " always upheld my duty " as ceo of the @entity7 estate to communicate with the others			2
" although my communication with family members has been somewhat stymied by the current litigation , i have continued to reach out and i remain committed to working together with my siblings on projects to educate people about the life , leadership and teachings of our father , @entity7 , " @entity29 said			1
@entity4 is " a company with unrivaled resources for making epic films of the highest quality , offers an unprecedented opportunity for educating the largest possible audience about our father 's legacy as the leader of @entity129 's greatest nonviolent movement , " he said			2
" just as sir @entity132 's film , ' @entity130 , ' educated many millions of people all over the world about the @entity135 's teachings , i believe this project can do the same regarding the life , work and teachings of @entity7 , and i sincerely hope my brother and sister will join us in supporting this urgently needed project , " @entity29 said			1
@entity144 , an @entity48 public relations agent who has known all three children since the 1960s , when he was their father 's driver , suggested the dispute could be resolved			0
" i do n't think that either @entity7 or @entity13 are opposed to having a megafilm done on the big screen by @entity4 , but i think it 's the mechanism and the way it was done that 's got them upset , " @entity144 said			1
" they 're feeling that , until they resolve some problems with @entity12 , that they 're not going to be very forthcoming in letting this project go forward , " he said			0
@entity144 suggested someone such as the rev. @entity160 , a close aide to the patriarch during the civil - rights movement , might be able to help the siblings reconcile			0
