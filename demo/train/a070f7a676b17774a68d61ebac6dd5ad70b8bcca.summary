it 's not enough to eat good food , sit by the beach and sleep in for a week			0
sometimes you need to make the most of downtime by stripping away anything that could potentially cause stress , including children			0
whether you need a recovery trip on the heels of spring break or a haven from other people 's cranky toddlers , some hotels and resorts remove that unpredictable variable of youth and allow for a special kind of exclusivity : adults - only properties			1
the model is most widely available at beach destinations , where hoteliers are focused on traveling couples intent on a more romantic atmosphere			0
an adults - only situation allows the resort to tailor its amenities to fit the needs of guests of a certain age , which could mean massages for two on the beach instead of chicken nuggets on the menu			1
but it 's not just tucked - away resorts that are adopting this grown - up business model			1
the @entity43 , billed as @entity45 's first " gay urban resort , " is eschewing anyone under 21 from booking a stay			1
" i created the @entity43 to be a sanctuary steps from @entity51 , " says @entity48 , the hotel 's founder			1
" creating an adult - only resort in the city offers a welcoming environment for like - minded travelers away from the frenetic pace of the city			1
" no matter the location , adults - only accommodations come with the guarantee that you wo n't be interrupted by crying babies or rambunctious children			2
but be warned , this type of added luxury does n't come cheap			0
" when you 're choosing your vacation destination , you 're paying for the experience , and adults - only resorts can have a higher price point because they offer the ultimate experience , " says travel agent @entity67			1
check out these retreats if you 're in need of a little family - free @entity77 : @entity79 , @entity45 's @entity80 this country retreat 50 miles from @entity45 is strictly for the over 18 crowd , including both of its fine dining restaurants , which are open to nonhotel guests			1
originally built in 1911 , the @entity87 mansion houses 18 guestrooms , which range from standard to sprawling suites , all individually designed and overlooking either the estate 's gardens or @entity93			2
@entity94 elbows with the other guests in the elegant public spaces , from the fireplaced library to the outdoor heated pool or the championship croquet court			2
@entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 this luxury @entity104 hideaway set on 300 acres in @entity102 affords guests one - of - a - kind privacy			1
most of the 20 guestrooms ( you can choose from suites or cottages ) are spread out , so it 's entirely possible to avoid other guests altogether			2
instead you can hobnob with boldface names from the art world ; expect to see works by modern masters such as @entity119 and @entity120 hanging on walls			0
come winter , ski enthusiasts will also appreciate @entity124 ' six private skiing trails			0
it 's almost like having an entire mountain to yourself			0
be warned , however , that the property does open itself up to families with children a few times a year -- allowing even the youngest travelers to revel in its splendor			0
@entity135 @entity134 , @entity136 , @entity137 adjacent to @entity140 ' @entity139 -- an adults - only beachside complex -- is an uber - luxury sister resort called @entity144 , where private casitas sit right on the beach			1
guests who opt to book one of these exclusive retreats for two have their own @entity150 , private beach beds , butler service and pools and restaurants to choose from , plus access to the amenities next door			1
the @entity158 , @entity45 the year - old @entity158 is a rare urban refuge : while the rest of this list features properties in the countryside or by water , the @entity158 is one of the few city hotels that target a specific age bracket			2
the " straight friendly " resort does n't accept reservations from anyone under 21			0
so those looking to check out its 104 rooms , the 5,000 - square - foot wellness facilities , the popular @entity175 - inspired @entity174 and the @entity176 -- the first nightly gay party venue to open in the city in 15 years -- have to prove they are old enough to drink alcohol in the @entity182			1
@entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 this exclusive resort in southern @entity185 is so out of the way , it 's not uncommon for guests ( ages 18 and up ) to arrive via private helicopters , landing on the on - site helipad			1
situated on a peninsula , @entity193 has 25 villas , which feature private verandas and comfortable hammocks for enjoying panoramic water views			2
the pricier units really up the luxury quotient with plunge pools , saunas and @entity150			0
@entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 @entity204 is one of @entity205 's most beautiful coastal destinations known for idyllic spots for swim and surf			0
a reputation like this does n't go unnoticed by sun - hungry @entity213 of all ages			0
find refuge at @entity203 , where unobstructed views of @entity219 beach are reserved for the over 17 crowd			0
if a break from the water is what you 're after , the hotel is near a golf course and within walking distance of @entity204 ' historic city center , where you can settle in on one of its many restaurant patios for fresh fish .			0

some resorts cater to a mostly 18 - plus crowd with deluxe amenities
@entity238 in @entity185 is tucked away on a private peninsula
