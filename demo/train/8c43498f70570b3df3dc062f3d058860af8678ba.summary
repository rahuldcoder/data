the @entity0 is back -- but there were no big winners on the opening night of the knockout round			1
@entity6 was held to a frustrating 1 - 1 draw by @entity8 in the @entity10 capital , while @entity11 finished goalless in @entity13 with @entity14			1
@entity6 will be the most annoyed -- @entity16 's side had chance after chance to win the tie and put a dent in @entity8 's @entity0 hopes			1
in the end , @entity22 's strike ensured parity after @entity25 , the @entity26 defender , had given the visitors a first half lead			1
it could have been so different for the home side had it not been for @entity31 , the @entity8 goalkeeper			1
@entity31 denied @entity6 time and time again , much to delight of his manager , @entity34			1
" we could have lost , so i think the result is a positive one , " @entity35 told @entity36			0
" i do n't say very good because it depends on the result of the second leg but it is a positive result against a very good team with fantastic technical players			0
it was a difficult match			0
asked if @entity8 got away with it , he added : " when you see the performance of our goalkeeper you have to say yes , he made two or three important saves in the game			1
" i am happy with the result because two legs is now one leg with everything to be decided at @entity60			0
" @entity35 , who is hoping to become the first man to win the competition with three different clubs , cut a relieved figure at the full time whistle			0
time and time again the visitors were indebted to its goalkeeper , @entity31 , who produced a number of fine stops to deny the @entity10 champion			1
at just 22 , it 's frightening to think how good the @entity73 could become			0
here , against a @entity6 side determined to take some sort of lead to @entity60 in three weeks time , he ensured @entity8 got out of jail			1
@entity16 's men began the better of the two teams and @entity31 was forced into action within the first 10 minutes			2
@entity22 , seemingly constantly linked with a move to @entity83 , found space on the left and when his cross was headed powerfully towards goal by @entity88 , @entity31 was forced to fly into action			0
the @entity73 goalkeeper was soon busy again , this time saving from @entity91 as the forward 's header bounced towards goal , while @entity22 also went close with an effort which was tipped away			0
@entity8 , seven points clear at the top of the @entity98 , slowly began to grow into the contest but it still came as something of a surprise when it took a 36th minute lead			1
@entity104 , the captain , crossed from the left and after @entity106 had flicked the ball on , @entity25 rose unopposed to head the ball into the far corner			1
that goal was harsh on the home side , which emerged revitalized after the interval and was soon level			2
@entity88 , one of the most impressive performers on the field , found space on the left and his cross was headed home by the unmarked @entity22			0
@entity8 , normally solid and resolute in defense , was struggling to repel the @entity10 champion and @entity31 was forced to save from @entity91 once again as the @entity121 waltzed his way through the defense			1
@entity125 , alert to the rebound , thought he was set to give side the lead when the ball broke , but his effort was blocked by @entity131			0
@entity6 , third in its domestic league , continued to dominate and @entity22 wasted a glorious opportunity with 10 minutes remaining when he slid his effort inches wide of the far post			2
@entity91 might have stolen a dramatic winner at the death but his header was brilliantly tipped away by the overworked @entity31			0
@entity8 will now be confident of progressing to the quarterfinal stage with the second leg to come at @entity60 in three weeks time			2
last season , it was beaten 3 - 1 in @entity143 at the quarterfinal stage before recovering to win the second leg 2 - 0 and progress on the away goals rule			1
at least this time it heads home level and with designs on the last eight			0
" both teams were feeling each other in the first half , " said @entity8 captain @entity104			2
" @entity31 pulled off some great saves and we go away with a happy draw			0
" last year we made it very difficult for ourselves but we are in a lot better position now			0
" @entity6 keep the ball very well , @entity162 's range of passing is very good so they were able to stretch us but i thought it was very even tonight			2
" @entity25 has been different class defensively this year and always has been , attacking he always poses a great threat			2
" in the night 's other game , @entity11 was held to a goalless draw by @entity14 in @entity170			1
it was a frustrating night for the 2013 winner which had @entity173 sent off in the second half			0
the @entity176 midfielder , who was celebrating the occasion of his 100th appearance in the competition , was dismissed with 25 minutes remaining after picking up a second yellow card			0
@entity14 , which is forced to play its @entity0 home games over 1,200 kilometers away from its home stadium because of the ongoing conflict in the region , had not played a competitive fixture since december following the winter break .			1
