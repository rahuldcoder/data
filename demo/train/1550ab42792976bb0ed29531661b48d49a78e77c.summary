editor 's note : @entity3 contributor @entity2 is a bestselling author whose new book is " @entity5 : a @entity6			1
" @entity2 says a small town in @entity8 is one of the most inspiring places in the @entity11			1
( @entity3 ) -- all over the world this weekend , people are peering up into the night , trying to catch a glimpse of a sliver of the moon			2
they 're thinking about the moon because of monday 's 40 - year anniversary of mankind 's first lunar landing			1
and more than a few people are undoubtedly allowing themselves to dream of traveling to the moon themselves			2
it 's not going to happen			2
for almost all of us , it can be said with certainty : we 're never going to go to the moon			2
but there 's good news : we can go to @entity30			1
@entity30 is a town of barely 9,000 people in northwestern @entity8			1
it may be , in its own quiet way , the most inspiring single place in the @entity11			0
i - 75 runs right past it ; in your car , it 's there and then it 's gone before you even know it			2
yet if you make the decision to leave the interstate and turn onto @entity45 , which takes you into town , you will find yourself thinking about life 's most glorious possibilities in a way you seldom have before			1
each time i go to @entity30 , i try to put into words the feeling of walking those small - town streets , and each time i fear i come up short			1
but the lesson of @entity30 remains constant			1
a boy from this town -- a boy born here , a boy whose father , a mid-level state employee , was required to move from city to city some twenty different times before ending up back in @entity30 for the boy 's high school years -- looked up at the @entity8 sky and decided that he would soar			1
if the town at times felt cloistered and confining -- if the horizons the boy could physically view on the flat landscape of @entity69 appeared circumscribed -- he did not let that stop him			2
down through the ages , it was the one task that was almost beyond conceiving , never mind beyond doing			0
until , on july 20 , 1969 , @entity75 , of @entity30 , walked on the moon			1
you want to talk about the strength of the human will -- of the @entity11 will ? you want to talk about absolute proof that no matter where you 're from , if you set your heart to it , you can do anything ? take a trip to @entity30			1
stroll through the neighborhoods , stop in at the stores , maybe catch a movie at the old @entity91 on @entity92			0
try to imagine being the boy who did exactly that , when no one knew his name			0
his family had had to pick up and move so often , because of his dad 's job , that no one could have blamed him if his only desire had been to finally cling to one place			2
but he decided that if he was destined always to be in motion , then he should make the most of it			0
he was fifteen when , his family living back in @entity30 again , he signed up for lessons at the airstrip north of town			1
he had made up his mind : he wanted to escape the earth 's bonds			2
the moon was not the dream			0
the moon was merely the eventual landing strip			0
the dream was to fly			0
if you 're feeling hemmed in by life , if all your prospects seem to have dried up , if you feel stuck in place , walk around @entity30			1
then ask yourself : is there anything that can stop a person whose belief in what he can accomplish is fierce and unyielding enough ? there is a little museum in town -- you can see it from @entity132 -- that is dedicated to the life of the boy who once walked those same streets			0
the thing i have always loved best about the museum is the display of newspaper front pages from around the world on the day after the moon landing			0
every front page in every city in every country on the globe ran huge headlines announcing that the impossible had become real : that a man had walked on the moon			0
some of the papers said just that -- that a man had reached the moon			0
some made it more parochial -- they said that an @entity11 had walked on the moon			0
but the @entity156 said it in the only good and proper way it could be said , in that town , on that day : " @entity161 on the @entity162			0
" we all need to be reminded , from time to time , of just what we can do			0
we all , no matter where we live , have moments when we think that the odds are just too great , that life 's grandest accomplishments are for someone else			0
and it 's probably true that none of us will ever know the feeling of stepping onto the surface of the moon			1
but this is really not about the moon			0
this is about the limitless capacity of the human heart			1
so if there are moments when you begin to question what is out there for you , here 's a suggestion : come to @entity30 sometime			1
and look at the sky			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : @entity30 is a tiny town in northwest @entity8
the town is @entity75 's *birthplace* and where he dreamed of flying
@entity2 says the *mission* to the moon is a *symbol* of what we can achieve
@entity2 : " this is about the limitless capacity of the human heart . "
