@entity0 , @entity1 -- four suspected @entity6 militants are due to go on trial thursday afternoon in @entity0 for allegedly aiding fugitives from the @entity0 train bombings of 2004 , a @entity4 spokesman told @entity2			1
prosecutor @entity10 , at @entity1 's @entity4 , seeks sentences of eight to 13 years in prison against the four male suspects , who include a @entity14 , an @entity15 , a @entity16 , and a fourth man whose nationality was not immediately disclosed , said the spokesman , who by custom is not identified			1
the prosecutor alleges the suspects provided clandestine lodging in @entity0 and in a @entity23 suburb , as well as other aid to various fugitives who " were directly implicated " in the @entity0 train bombings that killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 , the spokesman said			1
@entity1 courts already have convicted 14 @entity6 militants for their roles in the train bombings , along with four @entity1 , the latter for trafficking in explosives used in the attacks			2
additionally , seven other prime @entity6 suspects in the attacks blew themselves up three weeks after the train bombings as police closed in on their hideout in a @entity0 suburb			1
that explosion also killed a police officer and wounded various others			0
the seventh anniversary of the train bombings was two weeks ago on march 11			0
last february , @entity1 's @entity45 overturned a lower court 's conviction of five other men for @entity6 terrorist activities that included aiding fugitives from the @entity0 train bombings and planning other attacks , according to the court order made public march 2			1
the @entity4 in january 2010 had convicted the five other men --- three @entity14 , an @entity15 and a @entity54 --- for collaborating or belonging to an @entity6 terrorist group and sentenced them to prison terms from five to nine years			2
but the @entity45 disagreed , ruling that telephone wiretaps used to gain crucial evidence against those five suspects lacked the proper protections under @entity1 's constitution , and there was " insufficient evidence , beyond all reasonable doubt , " to prove the crimes that prosecutors alleged			0
those five men were in a group based in a @entity23 suburb , @entity70 , before police made arrests in june 2005			0
some of the suspects to go on trial thursday also allegedly operated their network to aid fugitives from the same @entity23 suburb			0
the trial is expected to last several days .			0
