@entity0 -- the @entity3 oil spill is defining the political landscape in the summer of 2010 as much as the rise of the @entity6 did in 2009			1
it is driving the national debate , and changing the way we think about both government and business			2
of course , the oil spill 's impact is much bigger than politics			1
one of our nation 's most beautiful and historic coastal regions is under threat , whole industries have been put on hold , and we can only guess at the long term environmental and economic impact			2
but there 's no denying that the oil spill is shifting political fortunes with implications that will be felt throughout the midterm elections			1
a case - study is being written in real time : it 's an object lesson in how events can overtake politics in ways no one can anticipate			1
there are no winners and losers in the wake of environmental devastation , but there are those who are seizing the spotlight and those who are starting to smell like low tide on the @entity44			0
@entity45 : the governor of @entity47 had been on his political heels after leaving the @entity49 in the face of a strong challenge for the open @entity53 seat from conservative phenom @entity54 and declaring his plan to run as an independent for the office			1
but the oil spill has given @entity45 the chance to be seen as a leader above the partisan political fray , focused on solving problems that affect all @entity63 , and liberated from the party infighting that seems so small by comparison			1
even the indictment of his former party chairman @entity68 on corruption charges has n't been able to stop @entity45 's post-declaration of independence momentum			1
a new @entity47 @entity74 poll shows @entity45 breaking out with a double - digit lead over @entity54			1
@entity76 : the rising star @entity49 governor briefly became a political punch - line after his sing - song @entity81 - the - pageboy delivery of a nationwide address			1
but the youngest governor in the nation was always a more impressive figure than the speech sound bites portrayed , compiling an impressive record of reform in @entity90 during his term			0
now , he has emerged as close to a post- 9/11 @entity92 as the slow moving crisis has produced -- a hands - on leader , constructively channeling the frustrations of his citizens on the ground			2
his recent argument against the drilling moratorium may have raised some environmental eyebrows , but he 's looking at what he can still salvage in the local economy			2
my guess is that he 'll be on the @entity107 short - list for any 2012 @entity49 presidential nominee			0
a new energy bill : during the 2008 campaign , moving @entity110 toward energy independence and kicking our addiction to oil was one policy proposal which was broadly embraced by the left , right and center			1
both @entity119 and @entity120 backed cap - and - trade climate - change legislation as part of their energy plan			0
but in the wake of the great recession , enthusiasm for environmental aspects of energy planning lost much of their political and popular support -- until , that is , @entity3			0
now a bipartisan group of senators are optimistic that some sort of energy legislation will pass this year , possibly with a scaled - down cap - and - trade plan that affects only electric utilities			2
and i ca n't help but wonder if the evident risks of offshore deep water oil drilling also could cause renewed focus on the comparatively safe option of drilling at the @entity144			2
@entity146 : the @entity6 - backed candidate wrestled the @entity149 @entity49 nomination for @entity53 from @entity49 establishment candidate @entity150 earlier this month , giving her the slot to run against senate majority leader @entity152			1
but her ideological absolutism , such as calls to end the @entity155 and the @entity156 , now looks like dangerously na√Øve policy bumper - stickers that have nothing to do with solving problems in the real world			0
this disconnect can be counted on to derail the candidacies of other @entity6 - backed candidates come the fall , because calls for less government and less regulation seem out of touch with the need to respond to the crisis on everyone 's mind			1
president @entity119 : the @entity3 oil spill has hardened negative perceptions of president @entity119 's leadership style , playing into the flipside of " @entity119 " -- namely that the president is so analytical as to seem aloof			1
it has highlighted questions raised during the campaign about his readiness to take the " 3 a.m. call " and provided evidence of why we 've only elected three people without executive experience to the presidency over the past century : @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity119			0
comparisons to president @entity192 are overdone -- a reflexive attack by the right against any @entity196 president			0
but the tick - tock of each day that passes has been compared to the @entity200 hostage crisis in that they seem to symbolize an impotence of government			2
when the president of @entity209 , @entity210 , told a @entity53 subcommittee , " i still do n't know who 's in charge			2
... is it @entity3 ? is it the @entity214 ? ... i have spent more time fighting the officials of @entity3 and the @entity214 than fighting the oil			2
" it was a scathing condemnation of a lack of leadership			0
and when @entity210 said he wanted someone " with the guts and the will to make decisions " -- well , that 's what we elect presidents for			0
there is still time to turn this around -- the $ 20 billion escrow account was a step in the right direction -- but for the @entity119 administration , it 's later than they think			0
' @entity236 baby , drill ' : rarely has a political slogan ever sounded more stupid in retrospect			0
it was the frat - boy approach to energy policy -- pump now , think later			0
but saturday night has turned into sunday morning and we 're forced to confront the consequences			0
the chant not only took over the @entity49 convention , it started to change the country 's policy mindset			0
@entity249 polls showed that by april 2010 , over 50 percent of @entity110 said the @entity110 should " prioritize the development of energy supplies over environmental protection " for the first time in the 10 years the question had been asked			1
one month later , with the oil spill spewing , the poll switched , with 55 percent putting the environment over energy			0
the right response is n't to choose between the two but to refocus on the larger goal of getting ourselves off our addiction to foreign oil , responsibly increasing domestic supply while transitioning to renewable fuels and a green technology economy			1
in the bigger picture , populist anger at both big business and big government is likely to continue through the fall , with @entity3 and a faltering government response the newest targets of frustration			0
it will remain a tough time for any candidate representing the establishment			0
but the old hyper - partisan slogans which sustained many protesters last year have slammed up against a new demand from the public : stop fighting and just fix it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity286			1

@entity288 : oil crisis is changing the *dynamics* of @entity110 politics
last year 's concerns are being edged aside by other issues , he says
crisis response is helping two governors , @entity45 and @entity76 , and *hurting* @entity6 candidates
@entity286 : new demand from the public is " @entity303 and just fix it "
