@entity0 , @entity1 -- even in the darkest , deadliest days of @entity1 's war , you 'd find people still hopeful it would all work out			1
that the killings would stop , the bad guys would be routed and a stability of some sort would return			0
that the @entity11 would leave with their humvees and their private security companies and the country would -- perhaps -- get on with the freedom the @entity11 promised upon @entity17 's removal			1
prime minister @entity18 promised as much , and pledged an inclusive system for all			1
power - sharing politics and making all @entity22 -- sunni , @entity23 , @entity24 -- feel they shared national values			0
now , there a plenty of @entity22 who believe he had his fingers crossed when he said such things			0
just over two years ago , i watched as the last of 110 or so @entity11 military vehicles crossed the border from @entity1 and into @entity35 -- the same border crossing i 'd gone through in at the start of the war in 2003 with a @entity40 convoy headed to the @entity22 capital			1
i 've had nearly a dozen trips in between and now here i am , back in @entity0			1
the city feels much the same as it did during some of those other trips -- and that 's not a good thing			2
actually , it feels worse			0
read more : are things worse than ever in @entity1 ? the @entity11 departure may have ended the war for @entity11 , but for @entity22 , the violence , the bombs , the shootings and the torrents of blood barely skipped a beat			1
a lull here and there , periods of what might ( for @entity1 ) pass for stability , but really , the deaths never stopped			1
more than 8,000 people were killed here last year , mostly innocent civilians , according to the @entity68 the feeling in @entity0 today is one of dread -- dreading the next car bomb or suicide attack or assassination			1
the city is n't lacking a security presence -- it is awash in it			0
two years ago there were checkpoints , but nowhere near the number we 've seen these past days , nor were those manning those checkpoints as , let 's say , fastidious as they are now			1
just moving around the city is an exercise in moving from one checkpoint to the next , each manned by young men who themselves , one imagines , fear the next car could be the last one they ever inspect			0
getting around the city is as difficult as ever			0
traffic jams are a way of life here , but they seem worse because of the security presence			0
check points and police posts are everywhere , but they ca n't stop every attack -- eight bombs have gone off in @entity0 in the past two days as i write this			2
read more : 26 killed in bombings in northern @entity1 people have to get on with life , and do the best they can			1
one target of the terrorists is marketplaces , where locals put their lives on the line just to shop for dinner			0
many buildings damaged during the war sit unrepaired , but there are signs of construction too			2
there 's even a mall of sorts being built not far from where we 're staying			2
many parts of the city retain a tattered feel , like it 's a tired city , weary of the tribulations of the last decade			2
public services are a problem -- electricity can still be patchy , there 's no shortage of roads needing repair , unemployment is high , sewage systems are in desperate need of repair			1
@entity1 's to - do list , despite growing oil revenues , is a long one			1
in the " bad old days " of , say , 2005 - 2007 , barely a day went by when , sitting in our bureau , we would not hear a boom or gunshots , some dulled by distance , others rattling our windows			0
one day , a stray bullet pierced one of those windows			0
plenty has been reported about the violence in @entity155 and @entity156 and the resurgence of @entity158 linked radicals , but the killing is widespread -- from @entity161 in the north to @entity0 to the south of the country			1
dr. @entity165 was @entity1 's first @entity166 head of government , serving as interim prime minister in 2004 and 2005			1
tough as nails , but a committed secularist , he looks at his country today with more than a dose of pessimism			2
" unfortunately the country is moving on a sectarian road now , " he tells me as we sit in his office , hidden behind blast walls and protected by government and private security			1
" it was very dangerous to start with , and i warned leaders in the region			0
( now ) @entity1 has started a civil war -- it has n't reached the point of no return , but if it does then the whole region will burn up			1
" he points the finger of blame in many directions , from @entity191 to the @entity11 to @entity192 , but mainly at the man who now holds his old job -- prime minister @entity18			1
" he does n't believe in power sharing , he does n't believe in reconciliation , " @entity165 says			0
" he promised to do these things once he became prime minister , but in effect he talks against this -- accusing everyone else of being a terrorist , or corrupt , or extremist and so on			1
" authoritarian regimes do n't work in this country -- we tried this before and it did n't work			2
no one sect can rule , no one party can rule , no one man can rule -- we want a democratic country but this is not , unfortunately , what this government wants			2
" read more : zakaria on why @entity1 is in turmoil there is no shortage of those who also point to @entity18 , a @entity23 , and his sectarian brand of governing and say his alienation of @entity224 is why @entity158 - linked fighters could reappear so easily to once again wreak havoc			1
extremists thrive on disaffection , and there is plenty of that in @entity232 and @entity161 and other places			0
@entity165 is also unhappy with the @entity11 , saying they have made a " huge mistake " by supporting @entity18 without also turning the screws on him to engage @entity224 leaders and include them in a meaningful way in the running of the country			2
" they can support @entity18 -- that 's up to them , " he says			2
" but they should clarify to him that their support is conditional on inclusivity of the political process and respecting the constitution and respecting human rights			0
" i suggest to him that the @entity11 have of late been applying some of that pressure , but he disagrees			0
" of course the @entity11 are not doing this , " he says			0
" i do n't know if they are pushing , frankly speaking -- i do believe they may pay lip service , but they do n't fully use the influence they have as friends of mr. @entity18			0
" over the course of more than a dozen trips to @entity1 since the war began , i 've always encountered angry @entity22 -- angry at the @entity11 troops , angry at the lack of services , angry at the insurgents and the sectarian bloodletting			1
but on this visit , i 've found a hardening of attitudes right down the sectarian line -- shias who feel @entity224 are @entity158 - supporting extremists , and @entity224 who tell terrible tales of persecution , exclusion and fear of being detained based on their religion alone			0
the moderates who wish to embrace their fellow @entity22 , regardless of sect , are becoming harder to find .			0

@entity2 's @entity283 returns to @entity1 for first time in 2 years
@entity283 : mood in @entity0 is one of dread over where next bomb will go off
public services are *spotty* and deadly bombings are daily *occurrence* across country
former prime minister tells @entity1 seems stuck on path to sectarian war
