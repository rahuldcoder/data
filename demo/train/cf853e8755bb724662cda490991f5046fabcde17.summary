a federal jury on monday found a friend of @entity3 bombing suspect @entity2 guilty of obstructing the investigation into the 2013 attack			1
the jury found @entity7 guilty of obstructing justice and conspiring to obstruct justice , in connection with the removal of a backpack with potential evidence from @entity2 's dorm room after the bombings			1
jurors indicated in a verdict questionnaire that they did n't believe a separate allegation -- involving the removal of a laptop computer from the same dorm room -- amounted to obstruction or conspiracy			0
but his attorneys said they 'll appeal the verdict , maintaining that a different defendant was the one who removed the backpack and put it into a garbage bin , and that the jury was under pressure by a community upset by the bombings to find @entity7 guilty			1
" he never took a backpack out of the dormitory			0
... we will certainly push that the evidence , and my client 's intent did not match up with the actions of the case , " @entity7 attorney @entity35 told reporters monday			1
sentencing for @entity7 , who could get up to 25 years in prison , is scheduled for october			2
the verdict came in the first trial related to the april 15 , 2013 , bombings that killed three people and injured more than 200 others			0
@entity7 's mother wept loudly in court when the verdict was read			2
@entity7 spoke briefly to his parents before he was escorted out of the courtroom			2
prosecutors accused @entity7 and his roommate , fellow @entity56 national @entity55 , of trying to protect @entity2 three days after the bombings by removing a backpack and a laptop from @entity2 's dorm room at the @entity61 , which @entity7 also attended			1
prosecutors alleged that @entity55 and @entity7 took the laptop to their apartment , and that @entity55 , with @entity7 's knowledge , tossed the backpack in a trash bin			1
authorities eventually found the backpack -- containing @entity71 , a thumb drive and fireworks -- in a landfill			0
@entity55 is awaiting trial on the same charges and has pleaded not guilty			2
another friend , @entity77 , pleaded not guilty to making false statements			2
none of @entity2 's friends is accused in the bomb plot itself			1
prosecutors : friends knew suspects ' identities before public prosecutors told jurors @entity7 knew the identity of the suspected bombers -- @entity2 and his older brother @entity94 -- before the public found out , allegedly texting @entity55 , " i think they got his brother , " hours before the public knew their names or their relationship to one another			1
the friends recognized the @entity2 brothers after authorities released video and still photos asking for the public 's helping finding the two men , prosecutors said			1
@entity55 told his friends that he believed @entity2 " used the @entity71 ' to make bombs , ' or words to that effect , " an indictment against him reads			2
the government said @entity2 texted @entity55 after the bombings and told him he could go to his dorm room and take what he wanted			0
@entity55 showed that text to @entity7 , the government alleged			2
authorities alleged that the friends picked up the backpack and the laptop from @entity2 's dorm room on april 18 , 2013 , shortly before @entity2 was taken into custody			1
the @entity126 interviewed the friends as part of the bombing investigation , and lawyers for @entity7 said he did everything he could to help the probe when he spoke with investigators			1
based on that information , authorities found @entity2 's backpack in the landfill , his attorneys said			1
juror : friends were ' getting rid of evidence ' @entity142 , one of the jurors in @entity7 's case , said the panel found him guilty of obstruction because " the backpack was simply taken and discarded like they were getting rid of evidence			1
" " they just threw it in the trash , so that 's obstructing justice			0
just taking it from the dorm room , we felt , was obstructing justice , " @entity142 said			0
@entity142 said the jury did n't feel the same way about the laptop , because " they did n't destroy it , " and because jurors felt the friends saw the laptop as something they should take for its potential monetary value			0
@entity142 cited @entity2 's alleged text to @entity55 , inviting him to take what he wanted			1
@entity35 , @entity7 's attorney , said his client was being unfairly punished for what @entity55 is alleged to have done			1
the only thing @entity7 took from @entity2 's room , @entity35 said , was a pair of headphones that rightfully belonged to him			1
" i understand we 've spoken about pronouns in this case : ' they did this , they did that			0
' ( but ) my client did not leave that dorm room with a backpack , " @entity35 said			0
" he can only control what people do to a certain extent			0
... ' they ' did not do anything			0
" @entity55 went and took that backpack to a dumpster			0
my client was n't part of that			0
how a jury claims that my client had intent to do that with @entity55 , i guess , is a misconstruing of the plain evidence			0
" @entity35 said his team also would object to the court 's verdict questionnaire , which asked for both charges whether @entity7 should be found guilty because of the backpack , the laptop or both			1
@entity35 said the jurors might have thought that saying no to the laptop was significant -- perhaps thinking they were giving @entity7 a break -- when in fact it did no such thing			0
" we knew that could be misleading to the jury , " @entity35 said			0
@entity2 awaits trial , having pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges tied to the bombing and the subsequent pursuit of him and his brother , @entity219			2
@entity94 died in a shootout with police days after the bombing			0
@entity224 bombing suspect 's lawyers : we want trial moved away , to @entity226 prosecutors : @entity228 used @entity230 lights to make bomb fuses			2

jury : @entity7 guilty of charges relating to backpack
prosecutors alleged @entity7 helped dispose of @entity2 's items
defense attorney : different friend , not @entity7 , took items
his lawyers said @entity7 did everything he could to assist the @entity126
