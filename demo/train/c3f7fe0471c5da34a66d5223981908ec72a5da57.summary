the @entity1 has made its position clear , even amid @entity4 's most recent gun debate			1
it says enforce the gun laws already on the books			2
it 's well - known that the organization has actively lobbied to prevent new legislation limiting guns			2
but making this happen is more nuanced than just rallying its supporters and lobbyists every time a new law is proposed			0
since the 1990s , the powerful pro-gun @entity1 has targeted the heart of what most legislation is based on : studies about the effects of gun violence			1
last year , the @entity1 used its influence in @entity22 to push through legislation that would punish doctors if they asked patients whether they owned a gun			1
and buried inside president @entity28 's signature health care legislation is a little - known provision that prevents the government and health insurers from asking about gun ownership			1
the @entity1 says it is simply ensuring that taxpayer money is n't being used to promote a political agenda			2
" if gun control groups ... ( and ) individuals want to further their research , we 're not saying they should n't be able to do it , " @entity1 spokesman @entity35 told @entity36			1
" we 're just saying they should n't be using public funds to do it			0
" but public health experts say it 's all part of an attempt by the @entity1 - led pro-gun lobby to hamstring lawmakers			1
" if a bunch of people do research and generate solid evidence that suggests firearms policy should be reformed and either firearms or people who used them should be regulated in new ways , ( if i 'm a gun - rights advocate , ) i 'm not going to like that , " said dr. @entity50 , head of the violence prevention research program at the @entity52			1
" so , i 'll simply prevent the evidence from being collected in the first place			0
it 's a brilliant strategy , and ( the gun lobby ) succeeded			2
" a lightning bolt and a chilling effect it was n't a lot of money -- $ 2.6 million -- but it represented the bulk of the nation 's research on firearms safety in the mid- 1990s			1
" with regards to gun research , it was enormous , " said @entity76 , the founding director of the @entity77			2
in the 1990s , this small portion of the @entity82 's budget went to a program headed by dr. @entity85 that funded two high - profile studies that concluded the risks of having a loaded gun in the home outweigh the benefits			1
" that was demonstrated if you counted dead bodies ; it was demonstrated if you counted individuals shot but not killed ; and tallied up the good guys versus the bad guys , " said dr. @entity91 , who led the research teams under @entity85 's @entity94 program			1
opinion : let 's take politics out of gun research @entity91 said the studies were not politically motivated but simply a way to give homeowners information to make informed choices			1
but the studies created what @entity76 described as " the lightning rod that started the bolts of lightning from the pro-gun side			0
" in 1996 , it all ended			0
flexing its political muscle on @entity119 , the @entity1 successfully pushed for legislation that effectively ended @entity85 's program			1
to underscore its point , @entity124 -- in a move led by @entity126 , a former gun - rights advocate and @entity129 legislator from @entity130 -- added this language to the agency 's appropriation : " none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the @entity82 may be used to advocate or promote gun control			1
" at the time , critics in @entity124 accused the researchers of pursuing an anti-gun agenda and said the @entity82 's work was redundant			2
the provision remains in place today			0
the language created what @entity76 called " a chilling effect " for nearly all gun - related work at the @entity82			0
though the agency continues to track gun deaths and injuries , it does little work on how to prevent them			0
many years later , the @entity156 funded a similar study that triggered the same lightning - bolt response			0
in 2009 , the @entity156 study concluded that a person carrying a gun was nearly 4.5 times more likely to be shot in an assault than someone who is unarmed			0
two years later , @entity124 added the same restrictive language it had imposed on the @entity82 to all agencies of the @entity166 , including the @entity156			0
today , the @entity1 maintains its position that government research into gun violence is not necessary			1
" what works to reduce gun violence is to make sure that criminals are prosecuted and those who have been found to be a danger to themselves or others do n't have access to firearms , " the @entity1 's @entity35 said , " not to carry out more studies			1
" unanswered questions so why are government studies on gun violence necessary ? @entity85 , who left the @entity82 in 1999 , explained that many of the questions that his group was seeking to answer remain open			0
for example , he said , it 's not clear whether registering and licensing firearms lowers gun violence ; whether allowing people to carry concealed weapons increases or lowers the risk of gun deaths ; or how letting people carry weapons in places such as shopping malls or schools or bars or parks affects the number of deaths			1
" these are very big questions that we need to know the answer to , " said @entity85 , who is now president and ceo of @entity201			0
there are other private agencies and even partly federally funded programs that have researched these issues			0
but none was as far - reaching as what @entity85 's program did in the 1990s			1
the @entity82 's website still keeps track of the toll of gun violence -- or , as the @entity82 sometimes calls it , " lethal means			2
" yet , the federal agency does little of the epidemiological research it once did that might offer guidance to lawmakers			2
now that gun violence has been thrust into the forefront of issues on @entity119 after last month 's mass shooting at a @entity227 , @entity228 , elementary school , the focus has turned to the medical community 's role in the debate			1
last week , the @entity232 reported on a little - known provision added to the @entity234 -- better known as @entity235 -- limiting what doctors can ask their patients about firearms in the home			2
while the provision does n't forbid doctors from asking about guns , it prohibits health care workers from collecting that information , documenting it and using it for research			0
@entity249 leader behind @entity235 gun provision a similar law in @entity22 went a step further and would actually penalize doctors if they ask their patients about whether they own a gun , in most cases			0
a federal judge overturned the law , but gov. @entity258 has vowed to appeal			0
gun - rights advocates , including the @entity1 , have raised concerns about tracking this data , including the possibility that acknowledging legal gun ownership could bring higher insurance premiums			1
with these restrictions and the revived gun debate , doctors should become active participants in the discussion about gun violence and gun policy in this country , according to the @entity273			2
after all , the group said in a recent publication , physicians take a stand on other public health issues , such as smoking , air pollution , drunk driving and vaccinations			0
examining gun violence is n't a political issue to most physicians , one @entity22 doctor said			0
" physicians basically want two things : they want continued research so we can find out what is happening along the lines of firearms and health care , " dr. @entity288 told @entity36 's @entity289			1
" and the second thing , though , is we want to provide basic gun education			0
studies have shown if you ask parents , especially pediatricians ask parents , ' do you keep your gun locked , unloaded , keep the ammunition separate from the gun ? ' that decreases the chance of a death from a firearm			0
" where things stand now when @entity312 unleashed a hail of bullets inside an elementary school on december 14 , ending the lives of 20 young children and six staff members , the debate over @entity4 's gun laws reopened			1
days later , @entity28 announced that a task force led by vice president @entity322 would create " real reforms right now			1
" that could include a revival of the assault weapons ban , something that sen. @entity328 , d - @entity329 , has said she plans to introduce			0
it could also result in executive orders that would bypass the legislative process , @entity322 said wednesday			1
the @entity1 will participate in the task force meetings this week , mostly to " hear what they have to say , " @entity35 said			1
whether the effort in @entity338 results in significant changes to @entity4 's gun laws is n't clear			2
what is clear , according to @entity91 -- who led research with the now defunct @entity82 program -- is that the nation has lost valuable time			2
" democracy is not served by ignorance and by excluding certain topics , " he said			0
" i think that 's been the real loss in this case			0

in the 1990s , the @entity1 actively quashed a federal program to research firearms safety
the @entity1 says it *opposes* publicly funded research that could result in gun control
the gun control debate has been *reignited* after the @entity227 school shooting
this week , the @entity1 will attend vice president @entity322 's task force meetings on gun control
