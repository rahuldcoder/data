-- slowed , but not daunted , by @entity2 winds topping 100 mph , low visibility and snow , rescuers saturday pounced on improving weather conditions to move closer to where a plane carrying three @entity8 sent out emergency beacon signals			1
the condition of the three crew members on the @entity13 operated by @entity15 - based @entity14 was not known nearly three days after the flight went missing and rescue attempts began			1
the plane was flying from the @entity20 to an @entity22 base at @entity23 , @entity18 said			1
" it is difficult to think of a more difficult environment , " said @entity24 , spokesman for @entity25			1
the beacon stopped working thursday evening , possibly because the battery had run out , about a day after the plane was reported missing			1
by then , rescuers had pinpointed the location , but harsh weather has made visual sightings impossible , @entity24 said			2
winds , for example , reached nearly 105 mph wednesday			2
one search aircraft reached a camp about 30 miles from where the beacon sounded			1
two helicopters were moving toward the forward base on a glacier saturday afternoon			0

" we 've got a reasonably positive forecast for that site , " @entity24 said from @entity46			0
the missing crew 's survival kit includes survival suits , mountain tents and enough food and water for five days			0
the aircraft is believed to be at a height of 13,000 feet near the top of @entity59 , part of the rugged @entity61			1
it is a long distance from any bases in @entity2			1
" we would expect them to be with the plane , " @entity24 said of the crew			2
" common sense would dictate you stay with the beacon			2
" @entity14 did not immediately return a message left by @entity0 on friday night			0
in a statement wednesday , the airline described the flight as overdue			0
it did not release names of the crew members			0

" the @entity61 , about 100 miles long , was named by @entity92 during the @entity94 @entity2 expedition in 1907 - 1909			1
@entity95 , spokesman for the @entity96 , which oversees the @entity97 , said 24 hours of daylight this time of year should help rescue efforts			2
