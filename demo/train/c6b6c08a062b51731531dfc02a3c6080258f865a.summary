-- @entity1 , the international , seven - day celebration of life beyond screen - based amusements , begins today			1
it 's a great time to take a much - needed vacation from digital entertainment			1
each year , often in conjunction with schools , organizations and whole communities , families exchange their usual screen - based leisure time activities for more time playing , creating , reading , dreaming , connecting with nature and enjoying family and friends			1
( yes , we still have to use screens for work and homework			0
) if you ca n't celebrate this year , make it a point to join us in 2015			1
taking a break gives us a chance to catch our breath , look at how much time we and our children spend with screens and perhaps even decide to make some important lifestyle changes			1
many kids spend too much time with screens -- and it 's not good for them			1
as a psychologist and director of an advocacy organization focused on children and families , i frequently speak to parents about the impact of media and technology on young children			1
what i hear repeatedly is that the recent explosion of screen devices raises increasingly complicated challenges			1
digital media are so compelling , exciting and omnipresent that it 's getting harder to figure out how , when and even whether to set limits			1
adding to the confusion is the ubiquitous and persuasive marketing of screen products as educational for young children -- even for babies -- and that digital media are a often a surefire way for overstressed parents to keep their children occupied			1
screens are a fact of 21st - century life , and kids find them entrancing			1
why should we set limits or deprive young children of digital experiences ? one compelling reason is that excessive screen time is linked to a host of childhood problems , including poor school performance , attention issues , sleep disturbance , obesity and more			0
that 's why the @entity78 recommends discouraging screen time for children younger than 2 and setting limits on time and content for older children			2
because the explosion of smart phones and tablets is so new , most of the research on harmful effects is associated with television , but emerging studies are beginning to raise concerns about time with all kinds of digital media			0
at the same time , research suggests that monitoring time and content can mitigate some of screen media 's negative effects			2
as kids get older , setting limits becomes more challenging , but it 's still important			1
by adolescence , if not before , digital technologies are often completely integrated into homework assignments , connecting with friends and gathering information about the world			0
that 's why many families make sure to preserve screen - free family meals or institute at least one night a week when , except for homework , they all ditch their devices and spend time engaged in other activities			1
since it 's much easier to increase children 's time with screens rather than take it away , it 's helpful to recognize the need to make thoughtful decisions about media use early on			2
what do our youngest children actually learn from digital media ? one thing they may learn is to need screens for stimulation and soothing			2
for better or worse , the roots of lifelong habits and behaviors form in early childhood			0
the experiences we have in our first years of life -- and the experiences we do n't have -- shape the very structure of our brains			2
limited time with quality screen media and technology can be educational for preschoolers			2
but digital devices are by no means essential to their learning			2
as for babies and toddlers , the more time children younger than 2 spend with screens , the more time they spend as older children and the harder time they have turning them off			2
despite unsubstantiated corporate marketing claims that apps can teach babies as young as 6 months numbers and letters , there 's no evidence that infants and toddlers learn anything meaningful from any kind of screen time			1
there is plenty of evidence about what they need for healthy brain development -- hands - on play , active play and face - to - face engagement with the adults who love them			2
babies thrive when they 're talked to , played with and read to			0
time with screens takes them away from those crucial activities			0
what 's most important for babies , preschoolers and even kindergartners is to learn how to learn			1
they need the time , space and silence for hands - on creative play			0
they need to explore the world with all their senses , to nurture their creativity and constructive problem solving and to learn social skills to build the ability to work and play with other people			0
they need to acquire patience , develop stamina and be able to delay gratification			0
they need to learn to act , rather than merely react			0
they need to learn to generate their own amusements and to enjoy and value their own creations			0
young children ca n't learn most of these skills and attributes effectively from a screen			1
in fact , most of what very young children encounter on a screen today inhibits rather than promotes the kind of creative problem solving so essential to learning			0
makers of new digital media for young children distance their products from video and television by marketing so - called educational apps and games as " interactive , " but a 2012 @entity233 study found that only 2 % of the apps marketed as education for young children promote the kind of open - ended exploration that fosters learning			0
for parents worried about the strain of limiting digital entertainment , @entity1 is a good time to experiment and see what it 's like to replace screen entertainment with other activities			1
after all , it 's only seven days			0
you might enjoy it -- most people do			0
