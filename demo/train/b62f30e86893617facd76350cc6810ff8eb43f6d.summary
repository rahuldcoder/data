-- @entity2 - based wedding planner @entity1 has helped arrange the same - sex nuptials of nearly 75 @entity5 couples during her five - year career			1
but she 's never seen quite the surge in business as she has during the past few months			2
wedding planners have seen a surge in same - sex couples traveling to @entity12 to tie the knot			1
@entity1 's calendar first started filling up when the 1913 law that banned gay marriage for out - of - state couples was lifted in july 2008			1
but , she says , things became even more hectic when @entity19 , the @entity20 ballot proposal restricting marriage to heterosexual couples , passed in the november elections			1
now @entity1 and other wedding planners have seen a surge in gays and lesbians traveling to @entity12 to tie the knot			1
and the trend is growing quickly : on april 3 , @entity31 's @entity30 found its gay - marriage ban unconstitutional ; four days later , the @entity34 legislature gave same - sex couples the right to marry ; and on april 16 , @entity38 governor @entity37 announced he would introduce a bill to legalize gay marriage			1
not surprisingly , hotels and resorts that cater to same - sex weddings are cashing in			1
one is the @entity44 in @entity45 ; its @entity47 package includes an intimate ceremony , along with @entity49 and massages			0
and all their wedding packages come with access to @entity54 , a destination wedding - and - gown specialist that can accommodate not just one picky bride , but two			2
another property capitalizing on the ruling is the @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity62			0
the inn 's " @entity65 " package includes all the traditional trimmings of a wedding : rehearsal dinner , couples ' massage , garden ceremony , and officiant , along with either " his and his " or " hers and hers " stylists			2
the hotel also offers 25 percent off room rates on the couples ' wedding anniversary for life -- much better than a @entity83 set			2
@entity0 : 50 best romantic getaways for those who want to plan their own ceremony , @entity1 suggests the @entity87 overlooking @entity88 -- it 's where she 'll be saying " i do " this summer			0
@entity91 , chief marketing officer of @entity92 , a tourism and commerce organization for the @entity92 area , suggests a few other same - sex - friendly @entity62 venues			1
there 's the @entity99 , known for its large ballroom and experience in gay weddings ; the @entity103 ( " arguably the best restaurant in all of @entity92 , " she says ) ; and the quintessentially romantic carousel at @entity107			2
for those traveling long distances , the @entity108 can accommodate out - of - town couples and their guests with in - house ballrooms , restaurants and a spa			0
@entity0 : great romantic weekend getaways @entity117 , executive director of @entity118 ( a pro-gay marriage organization in @entity92 , @entity62 ) has become an expert on same - sex wedding planning since she arranged her own nuptials without the help of bridal magazines			1
" we may not see the lesbian version of @entity126 until a few more states legalize marriage for same - sex couples , but i have no doubt we eventually will , " she says			1
now gay advocates in @entity31 would like to create the same kind of wedding infrastructure available in @entity62 , @entity5 and @entity34			1
@entity134 , who started one of the state 's few gay - wedding web sites , began receiving inquiries just days after the decision was finalized on april 3			2
@entity134 admits that building a roster of gay - friendly vendors wo n't happen overnight			0
" it is taking some people a little time to get their bearings , " he says			0
one place that wasted no time in promoting itself as gay - friendly is the @entity149			0
manager @entity150 says the property has held commitment ceremonies in the past and looks forward to hosting same - sex couples in the future			1
despite the fast pace of change across @entity159 , however , wedding experts say all the feedback has been positive			0
" people may be surprised at just how few ripples the change in the marriage law has caused here , " says @entity117 , of @entity62			0
" there has been no backlash , there have been no protests			0
just lots and lots of people who are pleased			0
