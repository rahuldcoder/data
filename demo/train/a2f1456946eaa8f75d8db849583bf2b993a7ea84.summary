@entity0 -- the @entity2 will vote next week to elect a new president			1
the april 22 election pits incumbent @entity4 against challenger @entity5			2
@entity4 , a conservative , argues that @entity2 did well compared with other @entity8 countries in the @entity9			1
@entity5 , on the left , urges a more expansionary program of government spending to create jobs			1
normal politics , in other words			0
but the vote to watch is not @entity4 v. @entity5			0
it is @entity4 plus @entity5			0
the @entity2 constitution establishes a two - round voting system			1
the idea is to ensure that the ultimate winner obtains an outright majority of all votes cast			0
the system 's side effect is to invite the @entity2 to use their first ballot as a protest vote			1
thus in 2007 , the nominees of the two big parties won 57 % of the vote between them in @entity31 , with the remainder scattered among the hard - right @entity33 and various categories of radical left - wing parties			1
it is that small party vote that is the vote to watch in 2012			0
@entity4 and @entity5 disagree on much but not on the euro			0
both support the currency , despite the terrible economic toll it has put on the economies of @entity8			1
to sustain the euro , the countries of southern @entity8 are cutting government expenditures and raising taxes in a futile effort to balance their budgets in the throes of a worsening recession			2
the euro is doing to @entity8 in the 2010s what the gold standard did to the @entity54 in the 1930s : magnifying an ordinary downturn into a social catastrophe			0
unemployment has risen past 9 % in @entity59 , to 15 % in @entity60 , 22 % in @entity61 and 23 % in @entity62			0
in the past , generous @entity8 social networks cushioned unemployed			0
those out of work might suffer anxiety and depression , but they need not fear material deprivation			0
but that 's changing as radical budget cuts bite			0
@entity60 , for example , has slashed government spending by the equivalent of 7.5 % of gdp over the past two years			2
how much is 7.5 % of gdp ? to achieve a similar cut in the @entity54 , we 'd have to abolish @entity78 and the defense budget			2
so you can see why the euro project might begin to provoke public discontent			0
@entity8 elites have met that discontent by silencing it			0
when @entity61 proposed to hold a referendum on budget cuts , the @entity87 authorities forbade it			0
when @entity59 needed aid to remain in the eurozone , the @entity87 authorities forced distrusted prime minister @entity92 to resign and installed in his place an economist prime minister without an intervening election			0
yet discontent will emerge somewhere			0
radical parties are now rising across @entity8			2
in @entity2 , polls show more than one - third of the public now supports radical alternatives to the two big traditional parties			1
about 16 % support the far - right @entity33 and about 17 % the neo-communist @entity102 ( @entity102 )			1
the @entity33 and the neo-communists disagree on issues such as immigration and law enforcement			1
yet on economics , the two parties sound increasingly similar			2
both want radical change in the @entity87			0
@entity112 , the @entity33 candidate for president , has voiced sympathy for outright exit from the @entity117 currency			1
@entity118 , leader of the @entity102 , wants to assert political control over the independent @entity120			1
as they attack the @entity87 and the euro , the far left and the far right are gaining supporters they never previously could have hoped for			2
one poll shows 25 % of @entity2 young people supporting the @entity33			1
the @entity33 is also making inroads in the traditional heartland of @entity2 social democracy , the industrial northeast			1
as @entity4 and @entity5 campaign from tv studios , the neo-communist @entity118 is exciting frenzied rallies in @entity2 's poorer neighborhoods			1
when @entity4 and @entity5 belatedly staged public meetings on sunday , @entity118 mocked them for imitating his accessible style of campaigning : they " will now also occupy the streets and risk appearing in public squares			0
" neither @entity141 nor @entity118 has any hope of winning the presidency , nor even very much of a hope of making it to the second round			2
what they are doing , however , is giving expression to public distress that is going unexpressed by the mainline parties			2
they may not win enough votes			2
but they are exerting enough political force to reshape @entity2 politics and possibly the politics of all @entity8			1
the euro was a terrible mistake			0
it is failing now in exactly the way predicted by its critics : a credit boom followed by a depression			0
the present policy response offers the people of @entity8 no hope at all , opening a political opportunity for extremists and demagogues			1
on april 22 , the voters of @entity2 will tell us just how large that political opportunity has grown			1
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity176 .			1

@entity2 , voting next week in first round for president , sees growth of *fringe* parties
@entity176 says the extremists are gaining *due* to *disastrous* economic policy
he says *preserving* the @entity117 is forcing leaders to cut spending in midst of recession
in @entity2 , @entity33 and @entity102 are gaining , though neither will win , he says
