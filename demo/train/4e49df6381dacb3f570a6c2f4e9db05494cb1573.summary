it 's august when the @entity1 feels like summer to me			1
the rest of the summer , the ocean water feels a little cold to me			1
in august , however , i can convince myself i could live there all year long			1
i 've been visiting the @entity8 town of @entity9 and nearby towns since the early 1990s , when graduate school in @entity12 made it an easy two - hour trip			1
traveling single with friends , a significant other and eventually with my family , i 've listened to @entity9 's @entity17 - quality cabaret , eaten a dozen times at @entity20 's @entity19 in @entity21 and staked out my place on the beaches in @entity24 and all along the @entity1			1
that 's why i 'm headed back to the @entity1 this year , although we 'll fly this year instead of driving because of our recent move south			1
and this year , we 'll stay in @entity28 and hopefully swim in the town 's freshwater kettle ponds carved out by retreating glaciers			1
five guys take same photo for 30 years as summer winds down and parents prepare for another round of getting back into school routines , there 's often one last trip to soak in the season before alarms and homework and fall set back in			1
it seems everyone has a favorite summer spot			1
ask a handful of friends and you 're likely to get a different answer from everyone			1
i asked a few friends and colleagues to share the places they 'd happily visit again and again			1
do you have a favorite summertime destination ? please share your recommendations below			1
@entity57 : where politicos go to relax my pal @entity60 can remember her first trips to @entity57 in the late 1980s , traveling to the @entity63 town for affordable weekend escapes with college friends			2
a graduate student on a budget in the early 1990s , she went with friends to play in beach volleyball tournaments and to enjoy the state park beach by @entity71			2
more than 20 years later , the @entity73 lawyer co-owns a home there and often makes the two - hour drive to spend relaxing weekends			2
these days she enjoys the side of the state park close to @entity79 , biking on the wide , flat roads , and playing golf at the @entity82 in @entity83 and @entity84 in @entity79			2
her " tried and true favorite " for a nice dinner is @entity85 , but she also loves @entity86 , @entity87 and the new @entity88			2
@entity91 has free tastings friday evenings ( at the downtown store ) and saturday evening ( at the @entity95 location )			2
" i like how the landscape shifts from urban to suburban to rural as i leave @entity73 and head toward the ocean , " says @entity60			2
" i like the wide open spaces that i drive by on the way to @entity57			2
once there , i like the dunes , the old watch towers and kayaking on the @entity105 watching the @entity106 arrive and depart			1
" 10 budget - friendly all inclusives @entity108 spots " @entity109 " every spring and summer , after those long , snow - buried @entity111 winters , city and suburb dwellers inevitably crave a new view			2
and so , they head toward a place everyone simply calls " @entity109			2
" to locals , it encompasses everything in the northern part of the state 's lower peninsula			2
the @entity124 offer more than 10,000 miles of coastline , but some of the most popular are the soft sand beaches around @entity128			1
one favorite : @entity130 in @entity131			0
the top always looks so close , but the climb can take hours			0
afterward , cool down in the clear , crisp water of @entity135			0
@entity137 lakes sprinkled around the upper part of the state usually feel warmer , and a little more private			0
my pal and @entity143 colleague @entity142 's choice ? the shores of @entity146 , near @entity147 and @entity148			0
her grandparents once owned one of the tiny cottages tucked in the woods around the lake			0
" how many happy hours were spent building kingdoms from perfectly damp sand , burning marshmallows over beach bonfires or floating in the water near @entity161 ? " she writes			0
" did n't we beg every morning to shuffle over the fuzzy rocks , through the minnows and beyond the edge of the dock ? " she caught her first fish there , a humble rock bass she remembers for its tough magenta gills and pearlescent copper scales			0
" the more memorable fish were the perch dinners provided by the lake -- small fillets grilled with flour , butter , lemon , salt and pepper			0
" there 's a cruise for everyone landlocked beachgoers head to @entity185 @entity187 resident @entity186 , a pal from our children 's preschool days , grew up on the beaches of @entity191 and still needs to get her toes in the sand			1
she started going to @entity194 and @entity195 on @entity185 's highway 30 - a when she moved to the @entity197 nine years ago , and it 's " hands down the best beach vacation anywhere , " she says			0
" the sand is soft and white , and the water is turquoise - really beautiful			0
" @entity204 's family and friends usually rent a house with a gourmet kitchen for a week in may , when the weather is just right			0
there are just enough beach areas , pools , restaurants and ice cream shops for the family within walking or biking distance			1
( her husband likes the @entity220 golf course in @entity221 )			0
" i want my kids to play on the beach , not have to schlep them to rides and toy stores , " she says			0
the group likes to food shop at @entity228 's in @entity229 for groceries and head to @entity232 's in @entity195 for drinks			0
( sitters are easy to find , she says			0
) @entity236 : summer all year if i need summer anytime of year , i sometimes take the plunge for the transcontinental flight to my hometown of @entity236 , where the weather is often warm enough for swimming ( the water is always cold , so jump in quickly )			1
many tourists will head to @entity246 or @entity247 for quality sunning , swimming and surfing			1
others might head to @entity251 or @entity252 , near @entity253 and many of the beach area hotels			0
i wo n't argue with them			0
i spent many a high school weekend on those beaches , depending on who was organizing the bonfire			1
my favorite spot was practically in my @entity262 backyard , when i was prepared to walk			1
during the last days of summer and into fall , we 'd cut through the campus of @entity266 and hike down @entity267 toward a somewhat secret staircase to the tide pools			1
in the daytime , scattered surfers would try to catch a wave in the distance while children played in the shallow waters			0
if you want a view of the point where @entity279 became the first @entity280 to step foot on what is now the @entity283 of the @entity284 , head to @entity286 and pay the @entity288 fee to see the most spectacular view of @entity236			0
military buffs can enjoy the views of warships under repair and pay their respects at @entity295			0
for my favorite seafood joint , head to @entity298 and watch the fishing boats pull right up to the restaurant dock to unload their catch			1
where do you go to capture those last days of summer ? do you like to visit the spots of your childhood or do you prefer to explore new places ?			0
