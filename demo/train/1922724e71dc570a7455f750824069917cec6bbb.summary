rebel and @entity2 forces battled early saturday for a building that houses state - run tv and radio studios in @entity6 , a day after the @entity7 approved a resolution that slams the @entity2 government for its actions and the @entity11 for its failure to counter the crisis			1
elements of the @entity15 took partial control of the @entity6 building , according to the opposition @entity18 , but had to withdraw because of snipers and military shelling			2
the opposition @entity21 said that tv service has been disrupted			2
meanwhile , state - run television , based in @entity24 , reported earlier that " a group of mercenaries and terrorists attacked civilians and the television and radio building in @entity6 and our honorable armed forces are fighting them			1
" @entity33 can not independently confirm reports of violence because the government restricts access by foreign journalists			0
the @entity7 adopted the @entity40 - sponsored resolution 133 - 12 with 31 abstentions			2
it came a day after @entity42 announced his resignation as the @entity11 and @entity45 special envoy to @entity2			1
he championed a six - point peace plan that has failed to take hold			2
the resolution notes " human rights abuses by armed opposition groups " and condemns " all violence , irrespective of where it comes from , including terrorist acts			0
" but most of its ire is reserved for president @entity59 's regime			2
it strongly condemns " the continued widespread and systematic gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the @entity2 authorities and pro-governmental militias			1
" it cites " the use of force against civilians , massacres , arbitrary executions , the killing and persecution of protesters , human rights defenders and journalists , arbitrary detention , enforced disappearances , interference with medical treatment , torture , sexual violence , and ill - treatment , including against children			2
" it also underscores its " grave concern at the threat by the @entity2 authorities to use chemical or biological weapons			1
" the resolution expresses " deep concern at the lack of progress towards implementation of the six - point plan " and deplores " the failure of the @entity11 to agree on measures to ensure the compliance of @entity2 authorities with its decisions			1
" general assembly resolutions are not legally binding , unlike @entity11 resolutions			1
but diplomats at the @entity7 strongly upbraided the @entity11 , where @entity105 and @entity106 have vetoed tough resolutions against @entity2			1
@entity105 , @entity106 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity2 were among those voting against the resolution			1
@entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 were among those abstaining			0

@entity122 ambassador to the @entity11 @entity123 hailed the vote " by an overwhelming majority of @entity11 member states			1
" " @entity127 demanded once more that the first step in the cessation of violence be made by the @entity59 regime , " she said			0
" importantly , the resolution also welcomes the @entity45 's july 22 decision , which calls for @entity59 to step down and for a transitional government to be formed			2
the @entity122 is pleased that the @entity7 has made it abundantly clear that @entity2 's chemical weapons must remain secure and that members of the regime will be held accountable in the event such weapons are used			1
" " the conflict in @entity2 is a test of everything this organization stands for , " @entity11 @entity141 ban ki - moon told the assembly ahead of the vote			1
" i do not want today 's @entity148 to fail that test			2
" @entity2 's @entity11 ambassador , @entity150 , called the resolution a " piece of theater " that serves the interests of other countries in the region			1
he cited " foreign interference " and what he called the use of human shields by @entity2 rebels			1
@entity162 , founder of the @entity163 , said the @entity148 sometimes builds unreasonable expectations by " creating the impression that somebody is going to do something about a problem			0
... in the end , it almost never can do anything			0
" but @entity11 spokesman @entity172 said the body can be effective , such as when the @entity11 united against former @entity175 strongman @entity174 and halted an offensive by his military			1
@entity178 intensified across @entity2 on friday , and @entity179 made reference to the violence in @entity6 , the nation 's most populous city			1
for days , it has been engulfed in fighting between regime forces and rebels			2
an all - out battle is predicted there			2
at least 120 people were reported dead in the country 's violence on friday , the opposition @entity18 said			1
the group said that at least 72 of the fatalities occurred in a government massacre in the @entity196 neighborhood of @entity197			0
as they have every friday since the uprising began nearly 17 months ago , protesters marched across the country with a theme for the week			0
@entity202 , the restive province in the east , was the focus of anti-government demonstrators this week : " heroic @entity202 , the coming victory from the east			0
" regime shells have battered the area for weeks , and protesters wanted to show solidarity with the people there			0
at least seven people were killed in @entity202 on friday , the @entity18 said			0
" despite the big battle in @entity6 , we feel that @entity202 is also leading the fight against the @entity59 regime and most of the cities and villages in the province have been liberated , " said @entity215 , a spokesman for the opposition @entity216 , the anti-al - @entity59 political movement based in @entity120			2
@entity215 said the opposition is working on setting up a secure central command			0
" our main mission is to form local neighborhood councils in order to avoid the cities slipping into chaos once the regime falls , " @entity215 said			0
" we had to wait until we had more liberated areas , and now we feel more confident after the latest developments in @entity6			0
" @entity234 , a retired @entity2 general who supports the opposition , said the rebel 's capture of 40 to 60 tanks wo n't make a difference given that the regime still has about 4,000 tanks			1
acquiring sophisticated anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons might , @entity234 said			0
@entity2 has faced a diplomatic blowback over the crisis			1
a former @entity2 @entity247 employee speaking on condition of anonymity says the embassy in @entity251 is expected to close within two weeks			1
the former official cited difficulties dealing with @entity255 banks in the wake of international sanctions on @entity2			1
" when i left recently , the embassy had plenty of funds available to continue for some time , but the banks will no longer do business with the embassy			0
" @entity255 authorities , the official said , had been keen to keep the embassy open to maintain channels of diplomatic communication , but that communication now looks set to become much harder			0
according to the former official , two diplomats have quit the embassy this week			0
on monday , the @entity255 foreign office announced the resignation of @entity274 , the most senior diplomat at the embassy , saying , " he is no longer willing to represent a regime that has committed such violent and oppressive acts against its own people			0
" the second diplomat quit his post a few days later			0
the former official said @entity274 , a career diplomat , asked @entity255 officials for a meeting about the embassy 's finances and had gone to the @entity287 in the middle of last week			1
in the following days , according to the former employee , he was " nervous " and had unusually given the staff friday off work			0
the following monday , he called in sick , and later that day , the @entity255 foreign office announced his resignation			0
the former embassy official said most staff in the embassy do n't believe the @entity287 explanation because in recent weeks @entity274 had actually been trying to dismiss staff members whom he suspected of supporting the opposition			0
the former official said that once @entity274 realized that financial constraints would cause the embassy to close , he quit so he could remain in the @entity255 rather than be sent back to war - torn @entity24 with his family			1
@entity33 has been unable to contact @entity274			0
the @entity287 said it would not comment on private meetings and had no information about the possible closure of the embassy			0
