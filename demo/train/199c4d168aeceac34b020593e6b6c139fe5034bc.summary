-- the @entity5 administration vastly underestimated the tens of thousands of barrels of oil pouring into the @entity8 after the @entity10 disaster , despite contrary information from scientists using better methodologies , a report from a national panel investigating the response said wednesday			1
and , the report said , the @entity14 squelched higher worst - case estimates once government officials accepted them , preventing the public from hearing them			1
the staff also sharply criticized later @entity14 estimates that 75 percent of the oil had been scooped up , burned or naturally dispersed , saying an operational tool -- known as the oil budget -- used by responders failed to accurately account for biodegradation and was not peer - reviewed by scientists			1
the working paper from the @entity27 on the @entity10 and @entity28 looked at the government 's response to the april 20 explosion that triggered the spill , and whether it accurately and appropriately conveyed information to the public			1
the explosion claimed 11 lives and led to thousands of barrels of oil being spewed into the @entity8 daily for almost three months			1
" by initially underestimating the amount of oil flow and then , at the end of the summer , appearing to underestimate the amount of oil remaining in the @entity8 , the federal government created the impression that it was either not fully competent to handle the spill or not fully candid with the @entity48 people about the scope of the problem , " said wednesday 's report			1
federal officials have stated that the low flow - rate estimates did not negatively affect their operations to stop the oil spill			2
" even if responders are correct , however , loss of the public 's trust during a disaster is not an incidental public relations problem , " the 29 - page report said			1
" the absence of trust fuels public fears , and those fears in turn can cause major harm , whether because the public loses confidence in the federal government 's assurances that beaches or seafood are safe , or because the government 's lack of credibility makes it harder to build relationships ... that are necessary for effective response actions			1
" the report issued wednesday is considered a working paper			0
the commission will issue a formal report january 12 , 2011			0
the president appointed the commission in june and tasked it to provide recommendations on how to prevent future spills and mitigate the impact of any that do occur			0
the commission is headed by former @entity92 governor and former @entity48 sen. @entity93 and former @entity95 administrator @entity94			0
government officials , reacting to the report , said the response was " in full force and immediate " and that the government adequately warned the public of worst - case spill scenarios			1
rep. @entity103 , @entity104 , chairman of the @entity105 , said @entity106 wo n't be able to escape liability			0
" low balling the flow rate numbers was @entity106 's attempt to hide both the truth and their wallet from the @entity48 people , " @entity103 said			0
after the oil rig sank , the @entity113 and @entity106 initially put the spill at 1,000 barrels per day			2
the administration later derived a 5,000 - barrels - per - day estimate , depending on an " unsolicited , one - page document " based on visual operation of the speed at which the oil was leaking from the end of the riser at the bottom of the @entity8			1
despite " inaccuracies " in the @entity131 scientist 's estimate of 5,000 barrels , the government stuck with that number through may 27 , despite estimates from outside experts suggesting a much higher figure , the report said			1
the panel 's staff wrote that in some cases , nongovernment scientists relied on more refined or better - established methodologies			1
" it is possible that the early official flow estimates would have been more accurate if the government had either enlisted greater in - house scientific expertise , or enlisted outside scientific expertise by making available the data on which government estimates were based , " the report said			2
" the government appears to have taken an overly casual approach to the calculation and release of the 5,000 barrels a day estimate -- which as the only official estimate for most of may , took on great importance , " the report said			2
soon after the spill , the @entity158 and @entity106 reported a worst - case estimate of 162,000 barrels , but that was replaced by another estimate received by the @entity113 and @entity131 of 64,000 to 110,000 barrels per day			1
the actual figure turned out to be about 62,000 barrels per day			0
a barrel of oil is equivalent to 42 gallons ( 159 liters )			0
according to the report , @entity131 wanted to make public some of its worst - case models and requested approval from the @entity14			1
a member of the government team assembled to address the gulf between official and independent flow - rate estimates told @entity0 , " we were never pressured [ by the government ] that we should change our [ flow rate ] number			2
" @entity180 blamed the initially low oil flow - rate estimates on the poor quality of data the group of scientists had from @entity106			2
better video and data led to the rise in the daily oil spill estimate , he said			0
the report also faulted the government 's tracking of the spill			2
it said a @entity14 official in august claimed 75 percent of the oil was " gone			1
" but the response team could not support that claim , panel staffers wrote			0
that information was never meant " to be a precise tool , " and the administration should not have used it as a scientific report , they said			0
" it did not attempt to quantify biodegradation , or the exact amounts of remaining , dissolved , and dispersed oil , which were not the targets of response action			0
" further , it said , the government 's failure to account for the stages of biodegradation increased public confusion of how much oil was actually " gone			1
" the federal government later wednesday said it acted appropriately with regard to spill estimates and the clean - up			0
" as for the predictions about the spill flow rate , senior government officials were clear with the public what the worst - case flow rate could be : in early may , [ interior ] secretary [ ken ] salazar and admiral @entity230 told the @entity48 people [ in media interviews ] that the worst case scenario could be more than 100,000 barrels a day , " said a statement from @entity14 acting director @entity222 and @entity131 administrator @entity223			1
" the federal government response was full force and immediate , and the response focused on state and local plans and evolved when needed , " the statement continued			2
" as directed by the president , the response was based on science , even when that pitted us against @entity106 or state and local officials , and the response pushed @entity106 every step of the way			0
finally , and most importantly , the response provided results for the people of the @entity249			0
" regarding the flow and recovery of the spilled oil , @entity222 and @entity223 said responders worked with best known information at the time and later came up with improved analysis			0
" the facts bear out that the federal response significantly mitigated the impact of the spill , " they said			0

panel 's staff said the government response *undermined* public trust
report indicates the @entity14 office *refused* to air worst - case figures
