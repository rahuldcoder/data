-- scientists have found a decline in oxygen levels in the @entity5 following the @entity7 oil spill but have found no " dead zones " as a result , a federal task force reported tuesday			1
levels of dissolved oxygen in deep water have dropped about 20 percent below their long - term average , according to data collected from up to 60 miles from the well at the center of the worst oil spill in @entity19 history			1
but much of that dip appears to be the result of microbes using oxygen to dissolve oil underwater , and the decline is not enough to be fatal to marine life , said @entity26 official @entity25 , the head the @entity28 studying the spill 's impact			1
" even the lowest observations in all of these was substantially above the threshold , " @entity31 said			0
the samples were collected from 419 points at varying distances from the ruptured well at the heart of the disaster and at depths as far down as 4,800 feet , the group reported			2
the task force is made up of @entity26 , the @entity42 and the @entity43			0
the undersea gusher erupted in april , releasing an estimated 4.9 million barrels ( 205 million gallons ) of crude before being temporarily capped in july			0
the volume of oil -- and the amount of chemical dispersants used to break it up -- have created concerns about the long - term health of the @entity5			2
at the same time , the spill delivered a severe economic blow to the region , where fisheries and beach resorts are major employers			0
early findings from a mid-august survey led by the @entity61 indicated oil had settled to the bottom of the @entity5 further east than previously suspected and at levels toxic to marine life			0
at about the same time , a team from @entity67 and the @entity68 released a report that estimates that 70 to 79 percent of the oil that leaked from the well " has not been recovered and remains a threat to the ecosystem			0
" the latest study " does not discuss the broad ecosystem consequences of hydrocarbons released into the environment , " @entity26 said			1
but it concludes that the oil is continuing to break up and disperse underneath the surface , making the emergency of a major oxygen - poor dead zone unlikely			1
in early august , the federal government estimated that about three - quarters of the oil spilled had either evaporated or been dispersed , or had been skimmed or burned off the surface			1
the disaster began with an april 20 explosion aboard the oil rig @entity88 that left 11 men dead			0
the blast uncorked a @entity7 - owned well off southeastern @entity91 that spewed for 87 days before being temporarily capped			2
operations are under way to permanently seal the well			0
@entity7 , rig owner @entity96 and well cement contractor @entity95 have blamed each other for the disaster			2
@entity7 plans to release the findings of its internal investigation of the accident on wednesday , the company said .			1

deep - water oxygen levels are down but not deadly , report concludes
the study tracked dissolved oxygen levels from may to august
latest federal report does *n't* address the spill 's " broad *ecoystem* consequences "
@entity7 's report on the disaster is *scheduled* for release wednesday
