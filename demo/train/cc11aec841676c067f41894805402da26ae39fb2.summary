@entity0 -- the @entity3 saga -- the incredible story of elite politics , murder , intrigue and betrayal -- seems to be winding down with the trial and sentencing of @entity11			1
and yet one question remains open : what will happen to the man once tipped for the top job in @entity16 ? @entity11 , 52 , the former police chief of @entity17 , this week was sentenced to 15 years for defection , cover up , bribe taking and abuse of power			1
he set off the @entity3 story on february 6 , when he fled to the @entity22 consulate in @entity23 and told @entity22 diplomats that @entity3 's wife , @entity25 , was an accomplice in a murder case			1

@entity11 's startling accusations triggered a series of events that led to the biggest political scandal to hit @entity16 in decades			1
read more : @entity16 's @entity3 ' implicated ' in murder @entity25 and family aide @entity38 were arrested in early april , suspected of poisoning @entity40 businessman @entity39 , who died in november in the southwestern @entity16 metropolis of @entity17 , where @entity3 was the @entity42 chief			1
( @entity39 's death was originally blamed on excessive alcohol consumption			0
) read more : @entity25 , the woman who had it all shortly after , @entity3 , 62 , the charismatic leader tipped for promotion into the highest echelon of power , was stripped of his top posts for " serious breach of discipline			1
" in august , @entity3 's " brain - and - beauty " wife , was meted a suspended death sentence after a seven - hour trial			1
days later , four senior @entity17 police officers were also sentenced to jail for covering up the murder			1
read more : @entity3 looms large over party leadership these trials and convictions have been carefully scripted and apparently timed to " deal " with @entity3 ahead of the planned leadership transition at the @entity65 , which is expected to convene in @entity0 sometime in october			2
@entity16 has released official accounts of the @entity11 trial , reported by the official @entity68 and regurgitated virtually word - for - word by the mainstream @entity16 media			2
it said that @entity11 on january 28 told @entity3 that his wife was a suspect in the @entity39 murder			1
the next morning , @entity3 scolded @entity11 and slapped him in the face , the report said			1
it tangentially accused @entity3 of trying to cover up the murder of @entity39			1
" the murder of @entity39 and the plot to cover it up were precipitating factors , but if the chief actors had all kept quiet , it seemed that they had a good cover story , " said @entity78 , law professor at @entity79 in @entity80 " @entity39 's @entity16 wife was unlikely to challenge the autopsy , and he had been cremated already			1
" why did @entity11 decide to betray @entity3 ? the official story left much room for speculations			1
" something made @entity11 fearful enough to seek shelter -- perhaps he felt he could n't keep the story under wraps any more , " @entity78 said			2
" once he started relating his fear to @entity3 , and got a very negative reaction , he knew he was goner			2
" @entity16 said the trials of @entity25 and @entity11 shows @entity16 's commitment to dispensing justice no matter who were involved			1
but legal experts who followed the proceedings , which were closed to the foreign news media and the general public , say that is debatable			0
@entity25 and her co-accused , they noted , were deprived of their own legal counsel and forced to accept a government - appointed lawyer			2
no defense witnesses were called			0
defense lawyers did not have a chance to review the prosecution 's evidence or to cross-examine witnesses			0
some legal experts say her trial reinforces the widely held notion that despite three decades of legal reform , the @entity42 keeps an iron grip of many judicial proceedings in which law is used as a tool for political needs			0
@entity25 's statement at her sentencing , thanking the court for its magnanimity , inspired disbelief and ridicule			2
@entity133 , an exiled @entity16 novelist who lives in @entity134 , found her statement scripted			0
" not since @entity144 's show trials of the trials of the 1930s , " he wrote in a blog post , " has a defendant so effusively praised a judge who seemed bound to condemn her at a trial where no witness or evidence against her was presented			0
" said @entity78 : " @entity25 was a highly successful lawyer at one time , but her pitiful plea and acceptance of the sentence she received after being denied the counsel of her choice shows that no one is immune from abuse of law in the @entity16			2
" ordinary @entity16 ridiculed the decision to spare @entity25 's life , saying a commoner would have been summarily executed for the murder of a foreigner			1
on @entity161 , @entity16 's most popular microblog service , @entity25 was juxtaposed with @entity162 , a food peddler on death row who fatally stabbed two city management functionaries after they beat him			2
" a lawyer who commits premeditated murder gets a suspended death penalty , and a peddler who defends himself gets death , " one posting said			0
" this is the @entity16 justice system			0
" @entity3 has not been seen in public since april			2
what fate awaits him ? experts have offered divided views over whether the party will put @entity3 before a criminal court or spare him and the leadership of the disgrace by simply meting out disciplinary punishment within the party			0
" some have argued for inner - party disciplinary charges , but that route seems to leave open the possibility of a comeback , " said @entity184 , professor at @entity185			0
" in any event i still expect a decision before the @entity65 opens			0
" " if he ( @entity3 ) is not tried the public will not be satisfied , " said @entity193 , a law professor at the @entity194 in @entity195			0
" people will be disappointed in the @entity16 legal system if the authorities try to protect him from justice			0
" @entity184 added : " the leadership needs to explain what @entity3 's crime was , but i think they want to keep the charges narrow -- covering up @entity25 's crimes , possibly corruption			1
this will no satisfy supporters of @entity3 , but it avoids the open fight that might come if they raised the ideological issues			0
" @entity184 expects the @entity42 's central committee , the 350 - member policy making body , to convene in the next few days to decide on @entity3 's status in the party			1
" it should accept @entity3 's resignation from various posts , " he said			1
" that would follow past precedents			0
" @entity3 's defenders have accused foes of exploiting the charges against @entity25 to topple @entity3			1
he has not been given a chance to defend himself in public			0
@entity228 , a leading @entity16 forensic scientist working for the @entity229 , has cast public doubt on the conviction of @entity25 for murdering @entity39			2
writing in a blogpost , she noted a " serious lack of evidence " that @entity25 killed @entity39			0
" i feel very pained , upset and scared that our court believed the theory he was poisoned with cyanide , " she wrote			0
her post has since been deleted			0
@entity1 's @entity241 contributed to this report			0
