-- does the word " virginity " evoke discussions of sexuality or religious belief ? that 's the question residents in @entity8 , @entity9 , are asking after a junior high student was asked by school administrators to change out of a t - shirt that read " @entity13 " last week			1
eighth - grader @entity14 of @entity15 said she got the tee at a @entity18 festival last year ; on the back , it continues its abstinence message : " i 'm loving my husband and i have n't even married him			1
" " i just really liked this shirt because i was always raised that way , " @entity14 told @entity0 affiliate @entity22			0
she said she was pulled out of class and given a gym shirt to change into because the message on her shirt " opens up too many doors for conversations " about sexual activity -- or lack thereof			1
after the incident , @entity14 's mother , @entity32 , took to @entity34 to write a lengthy post defending her daughter 's wardrobe choice , stating she has always encouraged her children to stand up for what they believe in			1
she ends the post with : " virginity is not a dirty word			0
would n't it be great if it were n't treated as such ? " @entity45 superintendent @entity44 said , whatever the message , the school was simply adhering to its rules about writing on clothing			1
" if a student wore a shirt that said ' @entity54 ' or ' smoke more pot , ' they would also have been asked to remove it for the same reason ; it would no doubt be disruptive , " he wrote in an email to @entity0			2
" even positive messages can be disruptive and our schools must be fair and consistent in dealing with all our students			0
" as for concerns over free speech , @entity44 said @entity14 's message has come through loud and clear			2
" just the attention this incident has been given has certainly given the student and her mother the attention they sought			0
this is not a major free speech issue , " according to @entity44			0
" i suspect this is a common issue in junior high and high schools throughout the nation			0

an 8th - grader in @entity9 was asked to change out of a " @entity13 " shirt
her mom defends her wardrobe choice , saying it 's an *expression* of her @entity18
the superintendent says even if the message is seen as positive , the writing was *distracting*
