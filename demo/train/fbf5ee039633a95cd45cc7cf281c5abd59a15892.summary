in what is known as " bacha - bazi , " or " child 's play , " boys are forced to dress in female attire , dance and perform sexual acts			2
" i ca n't think of any country in the world in which children suffer more than in @entity10 , " @entity177 says			0
" in all our meetings with children , it takes a lot of time to make them smile			0
that to me shows that there is not happiness in their hearts			0
" she hopes that the monitoring program will deter people from taking advantage of the vulnerability of children in the combat zone			0
