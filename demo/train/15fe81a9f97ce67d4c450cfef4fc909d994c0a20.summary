-- from the 50th anniversary this year of @entity3 's " @entity2 '' to the recent @entity5 documentary " makers : women @entity8 '' that featured @entity10 and scores more women , it 's easy to assume that the @entity13 is at the forefront of women 's rights			1
even as the rest of the world celebrates @entity19 on friday â € ” not much of a holiday here â € ” the @entity13 will also stand out as one of the few countries yet to ratify a major @entity25 treaty designed to bring equality to women everywhere			1
critics of the @entity25 's @entity29 to eliminate all forms of @entity31 , known as @entity32 , say it does n't reflect @entity13 values enough			1
here 's what they are missing : the treaty takes @entity13 values of equality and women 's rights and makes them global norms			1
of the 194 @entity25 member nations , 187 countries have ratified cedaw			2
the @entity13 is among seven countries that have not -- along with the @entity47 island nations of @entity48 and @entity49 ; @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 -- not the first countries that come to mind when discussing women 's rights			1
president @entity57 sent @entity32 to the @entity58 for advice and consent in 1980			0
it remains in the @entity62			0
the @entity58 has held hearings on @entity32 five times in the past 25 years but failed each time to bring the treaty to a vote on the floor			0
why ? conservative organizations , such as the @entity70 and @entity71 , vehemently oppose the ratification of all human rights treaties			0
they insist that human rights treaties violate @entity13 sovereignty			2
thirty - eight @entity78 senators demonstrated this last december , when they refused to join their more moderate colleagues in ratifying the @entity80			0
@entity32 establishes the moral , civic and political equality of women and protects women 's right to be free from discrimination and violence			1
thanks to @entity32 , these values have diffused around the world			0
conservative critics are wrong when they claim that @entity32 reflects radical feminist views			0
in fact , a @entity78 woman , @entity92 appointee @entity91 , persuaded the @entity25 to draft @entity32			2
on january 30 , 1974 , president @entity92 called for the @entity13 government to commemorate @entity95 at all levels			2
@entity92 's announcement won international accolades and prompted government officials from around the world to follow suit			0
in 1976 , president @entity102 sent a bipartisan delegation comprising many accomplished @entity13 women to @entity105 to draft the initial text of @entity32			2
@entity91 's skill as a negotiator proved critical in persuading communist countries to approve the text of the treaty			0
the efforts of those @entity13 women paid off			2
it has empowered civil society organizations to demand that governments respect women 's human rights and to adopt policies to limit sex trafficking , domestic violence , child marriage and discrimination in the workplace			1
opponents have a point when they note that ratifying this document has not prevented some countries from being the most egregious violators of women 's rights			1
when the most powerful country in the world does not support women 's rights , it gives permission for other countries to dismiss their commitment to improving the status of women			1
with the @entity13 behind it , @entity32 would have even more clout than it does			0
the @entity13 once led the world in rights for women			2
in the 1970s , the @entity143 and @entity78 parties supported a wide array of women 's rights policies , including an @entity146 to the @entity147 , publicly funded child care and equal pay for women			1
these efforts weakened once the @entity78 stopped supporting women 's rights			1
i still believe the @entity13 is one of the best places in the world to be a woman			0
i would like to see my country once again assert global leadership on women 's rights			1
ratification of @entity32 is an essential first step			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			0

@entity164 : it 's easy to assume the @entity13 is at the forefront of women 's rights
year after year , she says , the @entity13 refuses to ratify a @entity25 pact supporting women 's equality
@entity175 : 187 nations signed ; 7 nations including @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity53 , @entity48 have n't
@entity29 reflects @entity13 values ; *republicans* once backed women 's rights more , she says
