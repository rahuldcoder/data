-- @entity1 has urged @entity2 to improve ahead of the 2013 @entity4 season , labeling the @entity7 team 's performance in last year 's championship unbefitting of the sport 's most successful constructor			1
last season two - time world champion @entity1 finished just three points behind eventual title winner @entity13 of @entity14 , but the @entity15 insists @entity2 must do more if the team is to challenge for the drivers ' title			1
" at the end of the year we were quite far from @entity14 and @entity27 , " the 31 - year - old @entity15 told @entity4 's official website after his first run out in the team 's new @entity22 car at a preseason testing event in @entity25			2
" we 've been in a group with @entity29 , behind @entity30 and @entity31			0
we can not belong to this group -- we know that			0
we need to be in the group of the leaders and for this we need to do a good job this winter			0
" last season @entity1 earned many plaudits for taking a @entity2 car -- widely considered to be uncompetitive -- to the brink of a first drivers ' title for the team since @entity43 's in 2007			1
@entity14 dominance the @entity46 driver draws encouragement from last year 's exploits and he is confident of once again rivaling triple world champion @entity13 -- if @entity2 can improve on their slow start to 2012			1
" at the first four races we had finishes of ninth in @entity53 and seventh in @entity55 , so even with all those problems with the car we were fighting for the world championship , " continued @entity1			2
" if we overcome our bad start of 2012 -- and think positive -- there is no reason for us not to fight for the championship again this year if we only improve the car a bit			0
" the 2013 season gets underway with the @entity67 @entity66 on march 17 and @entity1 has urged @entity2 to arrive at the @entity69 race ready to challenge the dominance of @entity14 , who have now won the drivers ' and constructors ' titles for three consecutive years			1
" we need to improve from where we were last year because obviously it was not enough -- we finished second and we want to finish first , " added the former @entity27 driver			0
" so our immediate goal to improve in the first half of the year should n't be that difficult			0
