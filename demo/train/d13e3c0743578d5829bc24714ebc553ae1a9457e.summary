@entity0 , @entity1 -- amid escalating tensions over the @entity1 , @entity4 president @entity3 accused @entity6 of militarizing the @entity7 and said tuesday her country would file a protest at the @entity10			1
" i have instructed our chancellor to formally present before the @entity15 and the @entity16 this militarization of the @entity7 , which implies a great risk for international safety , " she said during a speech in @entity12			0
" we 're going to file a protest , " @entity20 added			2
speculation in recent days had been that she would cut the @entity1 air link to the @entity25 mainland by banning the airline @entity26 from using @entity4 airspace to fly to the islands from @entity29			1
the saturday flights are the only scheduled air service to the @entity1 and carry fresh food as well as passengers			2
the president made no such announcement in her speech tuesday			0
@entity4 already bans @entity1 ships from its ports , an action joined by other @entity25 and @entity41 nations			1
" i guess we were all kind of relieved that there was n't anything particularly concrete			0
it seems to be another burst of hot air really -- and to that degree -- we 're relieved , " said @entity47 , a journalist and @entity1 resident			2
@entity6 and @entity4 fought a war over the @entity1 , which @entity4 calls @entity1 , in 1982			1
though @entity6 won the war , expelling an @entity4 military force , @entity4 still claims the territory , which has been under @entity57 rule since 1833 , as its own			1
@entity6 maintains that the 2,500 residents of the @entity1 have the right to determine their allegiance , and so far that has been staunchly @entity57			1
" we support the @entity1 ' right to self - determination , and what the @entity4 have been saying recently i would argue is actually far more like colonialism , because these people want to remain @entity57 , and the @entity4 want them to do something else , " @entity57 prime minister @entity61 told @entity57 lawmakers last month			1
addressing @entity61 directly in her speech , @entity20 said : " i simply want to ask the prime minister of @entity73 to give peace a chance			1
" tensions between @entity77 and @entity12 were raised even higher this month when @entity6 sent prince @entity78 to the @entity1 as a military helicopter pilot			1
the prince 's deployment comes as @entity6 is making other moves to support its 1,700 personnel at the @entity85 military complex in the @entity1			2
the @entity86 is sending its top - of - the - line warship , the destroyer @entity89 , to the @entity7 in the spring on what the @entity90 calls a routine deployment , according to @entity57 media reports			0
additionally , a @entity57 nuclear submarine is headed to the @entity1 , according to those reports			0
" we are having what in game theory is called tit - for - tat ... i do n't see an end in sight right now , but i 'm sure that war is not the end , " @entity100 , a professor of international relations at @entity102 , said after the president 's speech			0
so why , besides supporting the @entity1 ' inhabitants , does @entity6 want to hang on to the islands ? the answer may lie in the lucrative fishing grounds around the islands as well as a growing oil drilling industry			2
@entity4 , of course , has economic interests as well , but analysts say the current standoff has much to do with internal politics			0
" the government is being squeezed from lots of different areas , so one way to distract from the economic problems facing the country is to raise the @entity1 issue , " @entity120 , an expert in @entity122 politics at @entity123 in @entity124 , told @entity2			0
" it 's one of the few issues outside football that you can get universal consensus on			0
" @entity2 's @entity138 and @entity139 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity4 president asks @entity6 to " give peace a chance "
@entity4 will file a protest at the @entity10 , she says
@entity6 won the 1982 war over the @entity1
@entity4 still claims the territory , which it calls @entity1
