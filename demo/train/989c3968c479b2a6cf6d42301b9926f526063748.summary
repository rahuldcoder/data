-- the @entity1 is preparing to sue @entity3 sheriff @entity2 , known internationally as " @entity5 's toughest sheriff , " saying talks between the two sides have fallen through			1
the @entity9 administration and @entity2 's @entity10 had been in the midst of settlement talks , after the @entity1 accused it of systematically discriminating against @entity13			1
as part of the settlement , the department wanted @entity2 to allow an independent monitor to oversee reforms at his office			1
the @entity1 called it a " key , non-negotiable requirement			0
" the two sides were scheduled to meet wednesday , but @entity2 called off the meeting at the last minute , the @entity1 said			2
" we believe that you are wasting time and not negotiating in good faith , " said deputy assistant attorney general @entity23 in a letter to @entity2 's legal counsel			2
it added : " @entity10 's refusal to engage in good faith negotiations requires us to prepare for civil action			0
" @entity2 shot back , saying he would not " surrender " his officer to the federal government			0
" appointment of an outside monitor essentially usurps the powers and duties of an elected sheriff and transfers them to a person or group of persons selected by the federal government , " he said in a statement tuesday			0
" and so to the @entity9 administration , who is attempting to strong arm me into submission only for its political gain , i say , ' this will not happen , not on my watch ! ' " a federal @entity1 investigation into @entity2 's office made public in december described " a pervasive culture of discriminatory bias against @entity13 at @entity10 that reaches the highest levels of the agency			1
" @entity2 dismissed the allegations as a politically - driven " witch hunt			0
" he pointed out how president @entity9 opposed @entity3 's controversial anti-immigration law and how the president mentioned @entity2 as the person pushing the law , the sheriff said			2
" by the way , i do n't want to say it 's all politics , but everyone i 'm talking about happens to be @entity72 , " said @entity2 , a @entity67			0
@entity2 added : " do n't come to use me as a whipping boy for a national , international problem			0
" the 22 - page @entity1 letter alleged the @entity10 committed federal and constitutional violations			1
detention officers in @entity2 's jail invoked offensive slurs and profanities against @entity83 , calling them " wetbacks , " " @entity86 bitches , " and " stupid @entity87 , " the letter said			0
" sheriff @entity2 's own actions have helped nurture @entity10 's culture of bias , " said the letter , written to the @entity90 attorney			2
for example , the sheriff apparently endorsed one constituent 's letter asking for a " round - up " at one @entity101 street corner of " dark - skin ( ned ) " people : @entity2 told a member of his command staff in a note to " ( h ) ave someone handle this , " the @entity1 said			1
@entity109 , @entity2 's deputy chief , described the @entity1 's allegations as " a sneak attack by the federal government on the citizens of @entity3			2
" the @entity1 also said it is reviewing allegations that the sheriff 's office did not investigate " a large number of sex crimes			1
" the sheriff 's office has acknowledged to federal authorities that 432 cases of sexual assault and child molestation were not properly investigated over a three - year period ending in 2007 , and many of the victims apparently were @entity13 , the @entity1 said			1
the federal findings also alleged discriminatory policing practices by @entity2 's officers including " unlawful stops , detentions and arrests of @entity13 , " according to a @entity1 statement			2
it also noted that the sheriff 's office has discriminated against " latino inmates with limited @entity137 by punishing them and denying critical services			1
" it further blamed the office for allowing " specialized units to engage in unconstitutional practices " and for a lack of oversight and deputy training			0
the initial federal inquiry began in june 2008 and reviewed tens of thousands of pages of documents and more than 400 interviews , including current and former inmates as well as office personnel			0
authorities notified the sheriff 's office of a formal investigation a year later , a statement said			1
assistant attorney general @entity158 said the sheriff 's office initially failed to cooperate with investigators , prompting federal authorities to take the " virtually unprecedented step " of filing a lawsuit in 2010			1
he noted the investigation had uncovered startling levels of racial profiling against @entity83 drivers , ranging between four and nine times higher than against @entity169 motorists			0
@entity158 added that an independent reviewer involved in the probe described it as " the most egregious racial profiling in the @entity5 " he had ever seen .			0
