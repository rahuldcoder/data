-- white sand beaches , tropical rain forests and colorful coral reefs -- southern @entity4 would appear to have it all			1
@entity6 hits @entity4 in august last year			1
experts argue hurricanes are worsening due to human activity			1
but it seems that this area of outstanding natural beauty is also unusually susceptible to danger in the form of costly -- both human and financial -- natural disasters			1
this year alone two maximum strength hurricanes passed over the @entity19 , while extreme floods in the @entity22 and @entity23 regions in october affected half of the region 's 2.2 million inhabitants and drew comparisons with the havoc created in the @entity29 by @entity30			1
both hurricanes and the flood were natural phenomena but scientists and environmental campaigners argue that the force of these devastating disasters is exacerbated by human activity			1
the @entity39 has always been prone to hurricanes			2
each season , meteorologists expect the @entity43 and the @entity44 to experience between 10 and 20 tropical storms between may and the end of november			0
but in recent years it has been the intensity of these storms that has surprised analysts			0
in 2005 there were 15 storms classified as hurricanes , seven of which were considered ' major ' , or category 3 or more according to the @entity56			2
some scientists believe this escalation in intensity is down to global warming			2
" both observation and theory suggest that hurricanes are becoming more intense as the earth warms , " says @entity61 , @entity62 at the @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65			2
a number of ingredients are required to form a hurricane			0
one of the key components is a sea surface temperature greater than 26 degrees @entity75			0
records show that sea temperatures in the band of the north @entity39 where most hurricanes occur have risen significantly since 1994			0
a rise or fall in surface sea temperature can change a storm 's intensity by an entire category , according to dr @entity61			0
some scientists have attributed this rise in sea temperature to a natural cycle of warming and cooling known as the @entity39 multidecadal oscillation			1
but tests run on computer models at the @entity63 , where all possible contributing factors can be added or eliminated , conclude that the recent warming of the sea can be related to the dumping of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere			0
dr @entity61 believes that the increasing intensity of hurricanes will conversely result in less storms per year -- a hurricane cools the sea so that there is less likelihood of further storms forming in its wake -- but that the storms that do form will be much more devastating and much more likely to cost human lives			1
" sooner or later [ a storm like @entity30 is ] going to happen again , " says dr @entity61			0
" it 's only a matter of time -- it 's quite easy to avoid these storms by chance for a while but sooner or later it will happen again			0
" @entity22 and @entity23 caught the tail end of one of these storms -- @entity124			1
but the main cause of the floods was two cold fronts which sat over the @entity44 for several days in late october and early november			1
the heavy rain caused the @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 rivers to break their banks , leaving 80 percent of the state of @entity22 under water , 13 people dead and 240 still missing			1
the @entity138 estimates that half of the region 's 2.2 million people were directly affected			0
global warming is partly responsible for the disaster , according to @entity144 , co-ordinator of @entity4 's energy and climate change campaign			2
" at the moment , what we know about hydro - meteorological events is that there will be a major event with major intensity			0
we have already been told that by the @entity154 and there are also various @entity157 scientists who have modeled these scenarios			0
" but aside from climate change , @entity144 also believes that @entity4 's government knew that the state of @entity22 was at risk and did not do enough to prepare for such a scenario			1
" the fact is that the government of @entity4 published a document on the subject of climate change in 1997 in which the state of @entity22 was singled out as being particularly vulnerable to extreme rainfall			1
" you have this since 1997 and the ideal would have been that a degree of adaptation would have taken place			0
it all suggests a lack of infrastructure			0
" @entity179 believes that the damage in @entity22 and @entity23 could have been considerably minimized , firstly through long - term measures to reduce global warming but also through more immediate actions			1
other human activities also played their part in causing the floods			2
@entity187 meant that there were not enough trees to soak up surface water , while the @entity191 , set up in 2003 after similarly devastating flood hit the region in 1999 , with the intention of building levees and drainage canals along the @entity130 , @entity132 and @entity198 rivers was never finished			0
some newspaper reports have highlighted accusations by lawmakers of government corruption , with state officials unable to say where some of the money earmarked for flood prevention has gone			0
" the problem of @entity22 is that corruption continues reigning , " @entity207 , a federal congressman who represents @entity22 , told the @entity208			2
" without doubt , this tragedy could have been avoided			0
" if scientists ' predictions play out , this corner of paradise will increasingly experience situations such as the @entity22 floods			1
this year @entity4 emerged relatively unscathed from the hurricane season -- @entity220 and @entity6 passed over relatively unpopulated areas -- but it seems it is only a matter of time before tragedy strikes again , be it in the form of storms or heavy rains			1
the government of @entity4 will have to show initiative and prepare for such occurrences if they do not want to be responsible for the loss of lives			2

scientists say human activity is *provoking* more natural disasters in @entity4
the @entity19 *peninsula* has suffered two maximum strength hurricanes this year
in october , there were extreme floods in the @entity22 and @entity23 regions
80 percent of @entity22 was left under water , with 13 dead and 240 still missing
