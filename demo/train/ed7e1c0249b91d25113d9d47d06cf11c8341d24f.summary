-- the northern @entity3 's biggest earthquake in 25 years has people asking : is the world seeing more tremors than usual ? and is the long - dreaded " @entity6 " that could devastate @entity3 coming soon ? actually , experts say the world might not be seeing more than usual			1
and as for the @entity6 , there 's no sign that it 's imminent			2
the infamous @entity12 is due for its epic every - 150 - years rumble			1
but the quake that struck sunday , centered about 6 miles southwest of @entity15 , was n't on that line			2
" i do n't think we can make any connection on that , " @entity0 meteorologist @entity17 said			0
" this is on a different fault -- still part of the same system , still the plates are still shifting from @entity3 , the @entity25 and the @entity26			2
" more quakes in 2014 ? @entity28 , @entity3 , @entity29 and @entity30 have all been hit by notable earthquakes in 2014 , which has some wondering whether there have been an unusually large amount of strong earthquakes this year			0
the rate of major earthquakes -- those with a magnitude higher than 7.0 -- more than doubled in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the average since 1979 , according to a paper published in the journal @entity43 in june by @entity44 and @entity45 of the @entity46			1
but a time period of fewer than 50 years is n't a large enough sample size to definitively say whether this year has had an abnormal number of quakes			0
it could be a statistical anomaly , according to @entity0 meteorologist @entity52			0
" it 's such a small sample and short time frame ; let 's not get alarmed , " @entity17 said			0
the @entity46 notes that many earthquakes go undetected " because they hit remote areas or have very small magnitudes			2
" there has been a greater amount of smaller temblors in the central @entity63 , especially in @entity64 , which experts say could be a result of fracking in the area			0
in june , @entity64 surpassed @entity3 in the number of earthquakes this year			0
" when they first started happening , they were a big deal , " said @entity70 , a reporter with the @entity71			0
" it 's nothing i ever expected in @entity64			0
" when will the ' @entity6 ' strike ? catastrophic earthquakes seem to strike along the southern @entity12 about once every 150 years , the @entity46 said , citing studies examining the past 1,400 years			1
the last time an enormous temblor on the fault struck @entity3 was in 1857			2
" there 's a real likelihood of a major , major earthquake in the next 10 , 15 , 20 years , " @entity3 lt. gov. @entity81 said			0
@entity81 is former mayor of @entity85 , a city that sits near the @entity86 and the @entity12 , " the one that fear is most instilled in us			1
" but the @entity3 is less likely to see a massive earthquake soon , as only about a century has passed since the great 1906 earthquake			0
yet " moderate - sized , potentially damaging earthquakes could occur in this area at any time , " the @entity46 warmed			1
in 1989 , a 6.9 - magnitude quake struck the @entity3 during baseball 's @entity96			1
the @entity99 earthquake caused 63 deaths , 3,757 injuries and an estimated $ 6 billion in property damage , according to the @entity46			2
what about the 1994 @entity105 quake ? that mammoth tremor was n't on the @entity12 ; it actually occurred on a fault that no one knew about			1
that 6.7 - magnitude @entity3 quake killed 57 people and caused $ 42 billion in total damage			1
but even the @entity105 quake could pale in comparison to the devastation that the " @entity6 " on the @entity12 could bring			1
" it would be like having a @entity105 here and @entity105 here and @entity105 here , " @entity116 seismologist @entity115 said this year , indicating swaths of a @entity3 map			0
" it covers such a wide area that it would be ... a major disaster for the nation			0
" six things we 've learned since 1994 northridge earthquake why is the @entity12 so notorious ? the @entity12 is considered " the ' master ' fault of an intricate fault network , " the @entity46 said			1
it 's the fault responsible for the 1906 @entity85 earthquake , which killed about 700 people			1
the 800 - mile - long fault is the boundary between the @entity26 and @entity25			2
and because the @entity26 shifts about 2 inches a year , the @entity46 said , @entity138 and @entity85 will become next - door neighbors ( though not for about 15 million years )			1
so while it 's impossible for the @entity12 to sweep @entity3 out into the ocean , the @entity46 said , southwestern @entity3 is slowly -- very slowly -- sliding past the rest of the state toward @entity144			1
@entity0 's @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 contributed to this report .			0

the *6.0* - magnitude quake sunday was not on the @entity12
some *predict* the " @entity6 " will strike along the fault in the next few decades
@entity46 : @entity138 and @entity85 will one day become next - door neighbors
