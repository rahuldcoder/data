, released a worrying statement calling on @entity6 around the world to forget their differences and renew their efforts to carry out operations against @entity12 targets , be they civilian , governmental , military or diplomatic			1
but this was by no means the most troubling aspect of the communique			2
more important than the threat -- which , let 's face it , is nothing new -- was the fact that this was the second statement from @entity3 in recent months to go against @entity4 's official policy towards @entity22 and express its wholehearted support for the group 's actions in @entity26			1
the mere fact that @entity3 has released another call for unity among @entity26 's jihadist factions is worth ruminating on for a number of reasons			1
it is indicative of the fact that the @entity3 network is even more decentralized -- fragmented , even -- than first meets the eye			1
after all , @entity3 was expressing its support for a group that had not only long rejected the authority of @entity4 , its nominal leader , but is also engaged in the most bitter of hostilities with another @entity41 affiliate , @entity40 ( @entity40 )			1
making overtures to a group responsible for the death of thousands fighting for your closest ally in @entity26 is as significant as it is surprising			0
in releasing this statement , being outspokenly supportive of @entity22 for the second time in just over a month , @entity3 was sticking its neck on the line			1
however , its hubris paid off and the fact that we have , once again , heard nothing from @entity4 compounds suspicions of his feeling blindsided and disempowered by the rise of @entity22			0
this latest message indicates just how much the global jihadist dynamic has shifted since the @entity61 coalition airstrikes began in august			1
clearly , @entity22 and @entity3 are no longer as irreconcilable as many might have imagined back when the self - declared " caliphate " was inaugurated in june			2
this phenomenon , something dealt with at length in @entity67 's latest report on @entity22 , does not bode well			0
indeed , were @entity22 and @entity3 to cooperate in the pursuit of their often identical goal , the threat would be profoundly more difficult to resolve			2
certainly , there is a long way to go before this could happen , but that does not mean its slowly increasing likelihood should be ignored			0
and it is not only @entity3 affiliates that have made overtures to @entity26 's warring jihadists			1
in september , for example , jihadist powerhouse @entity80 spearheaded a " global initiative " to stop infighting in @entity26 and focus on the " real " enemy , in light of the " crusader campaign "			1
this was a significant about turn for a man who had , in the past , referred to " is " in the most pejorative of terms			0
statements of support are very different to pledges of allegiance but , whatever the case , a trend towards reconciliation does seem to be emerging			2
among jihadists , @entity22 is no longer the pariah it once was and , whether we like it or not , this is a direct result of coalition planes dropping coalition bombs on jihadists in @entity26			0
as many predicted back in june , intervention against @entity22 has been effortlessly worked into the " @entity108 " paradigm , that great legitimizer of @entity111 - motivated violence			0
in a reimagining of " the enemy of my enemy is my friend , " we are seeing jihadists rallying around the flag of @entity114			1
this trend may be slow , but the fact that it is happening at all is deeply alarming			0
moving forward , it is imperative that the @entity123 -- the @entity12 in particular -- rolls back its military involvement in @entity125 and @entity26 and ups the ante in terms of its humanitarian and diplomatic efforts ; the coalition must stop playing into the " @entity133 " paradigm			2
this means that -- and i 've said this before -- regional , sunni - majority countries must take the crisis into their own hands , force an end to the @entity143 regime 's crimes and bring profound change to @entity125 's political status quo			0
without that , jihadists across the world will continue on the path toward rapprochement , something that must be stopped immediately .			0

@entity3 last month called on @entity6 to forget differences focus on @entity12 targets
@entity156 writes that it was the second such communique from the @entity3 offshoot
it indicates how much the global jihadist dynamic has changed since airstrikes began , he says
the trend of jihadists rallying around the @entity168 flag is worrying , he writes
