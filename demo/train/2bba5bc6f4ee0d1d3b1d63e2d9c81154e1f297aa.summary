on a windy hillside near @entity1 , @entity2 , are the headquarters of a company with a simple goal : to make the smallest hearing aids in the world			1
@entity8 , one of the globe 's largest hearing aid companies , developed its first model in 1956			1
back then , it came with its own battery pack and had to be strapped to the chest			0
they 've been gradually shrinking ever since and 3d printing technology has now enabled the slender machines to vanish almost completely into the ear			1
" the smallest are less than the size of the tip of a little finger , " says @entity19 , the @entity8 ceo whose father co-founded the company nearly 60 years ago			2
back then , hearing aid technology had just made a great leap forward following the invention of the electric transistor in 1948			1
@entity19 recalls that when he was born , hearing aids had been hulking , impractical devices " that you wore on your back			2
" but the energy efficiency and relatively small size of the transistor -- which is used to amplify electronic signals -- paved the way for the now familiar " behind the ear " style of hearing aid			1
since then , the mechanics have become evermore sophisticated , moving from analogue amplification to digital and from behind the ear to right inside it			2
@entity8 are now the pioneers of a manufacturing process known as @entity48 or , less cumbersomely , @entity48			1
the process takes advantage of recently developed 3d printing technology to create staggeringly precise molds of the ear canal			1
" first we make the impression of the ear , " explains @entity19			2
" it 's still done the old - fashioned way : impression material ( liquid silicone ) is injected in the ear and as it sets it shows a perfect reproduction of the ear canal			1
" but it 's the second stage of production where things get smart			2
standing in the @entity8 lab , @entity19 demonstrates how the finely detailed mold is scanned through a 3d scanner taking millions of measurements to create what he calls a " 3d point - cloud " representing exactly the inside of a patient 's ear			1
then , layer - by - layer , a large 3d printer replicates the precise dimensions of the mold using photo - acrylic gel , a type of liquid plastic			2
finally , the tiny mechanical components -- consisting of a microphone , a receiver , a battery , and an almost microscopic computer chip -- are inserted into the plastic shell			0
" the detail that we can reproduce is down to a hundredth of a millimeter , " claims @entity19			0
the precision and efficiency of the process has resulted in the world 's smallest ever hearing aids			1
for @entity19 , this is a significant development			0
" @entity96 is extremely important ... it is so clear that nobody wants to demonstrate or show their hearing loss , " he explains			0
but the @entity48 process offers more than discretion			1
unlike previous models , which blocked large parts of the ear with big plastic shells , the so - called @entity108 ( @entity108 ) hearing aids allow for more sound to be collected naturally by the shape of the ear , and to flow down the ear canal as it would with unassisted hearing , improving the fidelity and range of sound			1
the fact that the shell is modeled so exactly on the user 's ear also prevents any noise from leaking out			1
according to @entity19 , this was the cause of irritating " whistling " in previous models			0
" the sound will leak from near the ear drum and out between the ear piece and the ear canal			2
it will leak out there and go back to the microphone , then it will feedback and whistle , " he said			0
in addition to these technical improvements , the precision of the mold , says @entity19 , means that it is substantially more comfortable			0
previous manufacturing methods , which @entity19 describes as more like a form of manual sculpting , allowed for small discrepancies between the silicone mold and the hearing aid , causing potentially significant discomfort			1
" the ear canal is actually extremely sensitive , so the tiniest irregularity may be intolerable , " he says			2
" now they are perfect every time			0
we know beforehand that they can fit , we know they are as small as they could possibly be and we know that we can make them exactly the same every time , " he adds			0
at least for now , however , the premium sound and comfort comes at a premium price			0
while you can get a conventional hearing aid for a few hundred dollars , the @entity48 produced models range from about $ 1,000 - $ 3,000 per device			1
@entity19 , as you might expect , says his customers rarely suffer from buyer 's remorse			0
" we get a lot of feedback letters , feedback from people who say ' i ca n't imagine why i waited five years to get one of these , ' " he says			0
" people tell us they had forgot the sound of the birds			0
they were walking in the forest and suddenly heard these birds again and they had n't heard them for 10 years and they had forgot they were still there			0
" that makes a lot of difference in your work , to know that you made a difference to somebody else			0

@entity2 hearing aid company develops manufacturing process based on 3d printing
the " @entity48 " process allows exact molds of a person 's ear canal to be produced
as a result , the company has produced the world 's smallest , most comfortable hearing aid
