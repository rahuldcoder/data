-- while dogs slurp to alleviate thirst , cats display a mastery of physical dynamics that leaves their whiskers , chin and the counter top free of liquid , researchers found			1
researchers spent hours watching a feline consume liquids in order to understand the forces			1
they also made a robotic version of a cat 's tongue and watched @entity20 videos of big cats drinking			1
using complicated formulas , the four - member team from @entity24 , the @entity25 and @entity26 came up with their findings , detailed thursday in the online journal @entity30			1
here 's how a house cat , which averages about four laps per second , personifies daintiness while drinking			0
cats extend their tongues straight down with the tip curled backward like a capital " j " to form a ladle , so that the top surface of the tongue touches the liquid first			1
" the speed of the tongue is quite incredible , " co-author @entity43 , an assistant engineering professor at @entity25 , told @entity0			0
" the smooth tip of the tongue barely brushes the surface of the liquid before the cat rapidly draws its tongue back up , " said the researchers , who received no funding for the study			0
" as it does so , a column of milk forms between the moving tongue and the liquid 's surface			0
the cat then closes its mouth , pinching off the top of the column for a nice drink , while keeping its chin dry			2
" that column , they say , is a balance between gravity , which pulls the milk back toward the bowl , and inertia , which refers to the tendency of a liquid to continue moving in a direction unless another force interferes			1
@entity76 knows how quickly to lap in order to balance these forces , according to the study , which drew on mathematics , fluid mechanics , physics and engineering			2
" this suggests that cats are smarter than many people think , at least when it comes to hydrodynamics , " writes co-author @entity85 of @entity26			2
unlike humans , who can seal their cheeks to suck in liquids , dogs and cats rely on lapping , @entity43 said			1
a dog 's tongue in effect forms a little cup to scoop up water			0
" cats are far more complex , " @entity43 said			2
their tongues do n't pierce the surface of a liquid			2
big cats do n't lap as rapidly as house cats , the scientists said , in part because their tongues are larger			1
" @entity114 [ tongues ] will go about half [ the speed ] of house cats , " said @entity111 , an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at @entity25			0
@entity43 and @entity111 said one of the reasons they undertook the 3 - year study was to apply the scientific method and rules of basic research about something scientists do n't understand			1
results of the study also may have implications for soft robotics , they said			0
@entity111 got the idea for the study after watching his cat @entity133 lap milk			0
@entity133 , which means " stars stars " in an @entity138 aboriginal language , is the subject of several videos and photos taken by the team			0
asked whether @entity133 is enjoying the celebrity from the release of the study , @entity111 told @entity0 , " i 'm not sure he realizes it			0

unlike dogs , cats do n't slurp when they drink , team finds
cats show mastery of physical forces , balancing gravity and inertia , to drink
