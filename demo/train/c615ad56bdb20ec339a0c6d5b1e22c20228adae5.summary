-- the surprise announcement on thursday that @entity3 will resign as attorney general has @entity1 buzzing			1
and the big question on everyone 's mind : who will replace him ? @entity3 has been in his position since the start of president @entity13 's first term			1
in fact , he 's one of only three remaining original members of @entity13 's cabinet ( education secretary @entity16 and agriculture secretary @entity17 are the others			1
) the attorney general also is a close personal friend of @entity13 , and sources tell @entity0 that the president will be looking to appoint a successor with whom he has a relationship			1
@entity3 's legacy so who might be chosen to fill @entity3 's shoes ? here 's a list of seven candidates who definitely will be in the mix for the job , in no particular order			1
@entity33 gov. @entity32 @entity32 is one of the names consistently floated as a hypothetical replacement for @entity3			2
@entity32 worked as an assistant attorney general in the @entity37 of the @entity38 during the @entity40 administration , and is a friend of @entity13			1
the timing is also convenient for @entity32			0
he 's not seeking reelection in @entity33 and will be out of his job come january			0
@entity32 would likely face a tough confirmation in the @entity46 though , and particularly if @entity47 take back control of the upper chamber in the midterm elections			2
plus , he might have his eye on a bigger job			0
there has been speculation that he 's considering a presidential run in 2016			0
@entity13 said in an interview with a local @entity58 news station earlier this year that he thinks @entity32 " would make a great president or vice president			2
" solicitor general @entity61 the nation 's top lawyer , @entity61 , is another name mentioned as a potential new @entity65 has served as solicitor general since 2011 , and in that role he 's argued several landmark cases before the @entity68 on behalf of the administration , including the @entity71 case			2
before he took over as solicitor general -- replacing @entity73 after her confirmation to the @entity68 -- @entity65 served as deputy counsel to @entity13			1
one potential con for @entity65 though is that he is an older white male , and the administration may be looking to replace @entity3 with a younger or more diverse candidate			0
@entity80 attorney general @entity79 a rising star in the @entity82 , @entity79 is another person whose name will definitely be thrown into the conversation			1
@entity85 is the first female , the first african - american and the first @entity90 - @entity89 attorney general in @entity80			1
well - known in @entity80 for her legal work , @entity85 might be best remembered on the national level for the small controversy last year that occurred after the president referred to her as " the best - looking attorney general " at a fundraiser in @entity80			1
like @entity32 however , @entity85 would likely face a tough @entity46 confirmation , particularly in a @entity47 - controlled @entity46 , because she is seen as very liberal			1
@entity101 , former @entity102 counsel @entity101 served as @entity102 counsel from 2011 until earlier this year			0
she 's a close confidante of the president and very well - respected sources tell @entity0 chief political analyst @entity106 that @entity101 is indeed a strong contender for the job			0
one potential knock on her , @entity110 notes , is her former role as the president 's lawyer might raise questions about how independent a @entity38 under her rule would be from the administration			0
@entity117 , @entity89 attorney for the @entity118 like @entity3 , @entity117 has served in the @entity13 administration for six years			1
@entity117 was nominated to serve as the @entity89 attorney for @entity122 's @entity121 ( which encompasses @entity124 , @entity122 and @entity125 counties , among others ) in may 2009			0
sources tell @entity106 that @entity117 's name is certainly on the list , but a potential factor working against him is that he 's not well - known to many people , including the president			0
homeland security secretary @entity133 before he became the @entity134 last year , @entity133 was a lawyer for the @entity135			0
working in @entity133 's favor : he was confirmed 78 - 16 to his current post			0
working against @entity133 : removing him from @entity138 would put @entity13 in the position of finding a replacement -- not ideal right now , given the new threats from @entity142 and the @entity143			2
@entity144 , @entity89 attorney for the @entity145 in may , 2010 @entity144 was appointed to serve as the @entity89 attorney in @entity122 's @entity147 , which includes high - profile areas like @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 , for a second time			1
she previously served in that job toward the end of the @entity40 administration , from 1999 to 2001			0
although she may not have the same national name recognition as others on the list , a source tells @entity0 's @entity106 that @entity144 is a known quantity to @entity13			2
@entity0 's @entity161 and @entity162 contributed to this report .			0
