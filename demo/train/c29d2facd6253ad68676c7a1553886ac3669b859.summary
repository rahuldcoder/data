-- clean water is vital to every single @entity2			1
families should be able to turn on the tap and have safe drinking water for their children , vacationers expect healthy rivers for fishing and swimming , and businesses need a steady supply of clean water to make products			1
the administration is proposing a clean water rule to better protect @entity2 's most vulnerable waters -- the streams and wetlands that feed our larger rivers , lakes and bays			1
these bodies of water were clearly protected by the @entity25 when it was passed more than 40 years ago			1
unfortunately , two convoluted @entity27 decisions , actions of the previous administration and inaction by @entity31 have left these water bodies in a legal limbo			1
this poses a threat to all of us			2
without this common - sense new rule , about 2 million miles of streams and 20 million acres of wetlands are at risk			1
these bodies of water may seem small , but they form part of the drinking water supplies for more than one third of @entity2			0
clean , healthy waters are also the engines behind a strong outdoor recreation economy			0
nationally , hunters and anglers spent $ 90 billion in 2011 and wildlife watchers spent an additional $ 55 billion , according to the @entity51 , @entity52 , and @entity53			0
these dollars translate into economic vitality -- filling beds in hotels and making the cash registers ring in restaurants and sporting goods stores			0
all told , hunting and angling expenditures contribute about $ 200 billion to the economy each year			0
like many @entity2 , i treasure our waters , and i am proud that i am able to manage my properties to preserve their natural streams , wetlands and grasslands			2
on my @entity71 in southern @entity72 , you can see the importance of small streams in action			0
these tiny streams , in a very arid area , support a diversity of animal and plant life that make this place special			0
in @entity72 , 55 % of all vertebrate species depend on wetland habitats , and nearly 25 % of the threatened or endangered species in the state live in wetlands			0
it feels good to do my part to protect and restore small streams and riparian areas where i can			2
in order to ensure we have safe drinking water for all , communities upstream and downstream must work together			0
i applaud the administration 's initiative to restore @entity25 protections to these vulnerable waters and to keep them from pollution , and i urge the president to follow through and finish the effort this year			1
i urge members of @entity31 to support the @entity105 's public process to clarify and restore these protections -- a public process called for by the @entity27			2
our waters have been threatened by this uncertain status quo for more than a decade			0
we ca n't wait any longer			1
now is the time to ensure the @entity25 effectively protects the water our children drink -- and the businesses that keep our economy strong			1
poll after poll shows that a strong majority of @entity2 value clean drinking water			2
i write now to add my voice to the chorus demanding clean water .			1

@entity122 : clean water is vital , but *sources* of our rivers and lakes were not protected
@entity105 will *advance* ruling to protect streams and wetlands , which have been in legal limbo
@entity122 : if streams and wetlands become polluted , it poses a threat to all clean water
@entity122 : we ca n't wait any longer for 40 - year - old @entity25 to extend its protection
