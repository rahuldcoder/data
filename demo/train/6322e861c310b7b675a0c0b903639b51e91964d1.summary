spewing red hot lava 300 meters in the air , an erupting volcano in the east of the @entity4 is turning the war - torn @entity6 country into an unlikely tourist destination			1
tourists have been visiting the @entity10 on overnight treks and in increasing numbers to witness the latest lava eruptions from the volcano , which have been flowing since november 6			1
@entity15 is considered to be the most active volcano in the area and for $ 300 each , around 60 to 70 volcano fans have been traveling an hour from the eastern city of @entity20 to the start of the trek at the @entity10			1
with the aid of the @entity24 , @entity10 has been a driver in boosting tourism to eastern @entity4 over the past few years			1
tourism officials predict that visitor numbers at @entity10 will rise to nearly 4,000 this year -- up from 1,800 in 2010 , while @entity30 's oldest national park is expected to raise over $ 1 million in revenue for the first time in its history , according to a report in the @entity35			1
the @entity4 is home to eight national parks , five of which are @entity39 , as well as being home to many endangered species , making it ripe territory for eco-tourism			1
however statistics on the country , which has been embroiled in civil war since 1998 , are grim reading			0
it is a place where women are systemically raped , children are forced to fight as soldiers and most people struggle to survive on less than $ 2 a day			0
but the volcano 's proximity and its vivid colors are worth braving the rough terrain for , according to one of the first people to visit the area			2
" we really wanted to go in , " says @entity61 , a tour operator from @entity63 who was in one of the first overnight volcano treks			1
" ( national park wardens ) had to assess the safety of it and then we hiked in immediately			1
" on the northern side of the volcano , participants can watch lava spew out of the @entity74 from a tented camping site 1.5 kilometers away , which has been deemed safe by a volcanologist			2
@entity61 says : " where you look across at the volcano , there is nothing between you and it except a few piles of rock			0
it is really quite dramatic			0
" you really do n't know what is happening underneath ( the ground ) -- it could just blow up			0
but it seemed like pretty regular explosions			0
" @entity61 traveled into the national park with two friends and recommends staying overnight			1
" the colors are so much more vivid ... it really is beautiful			0
we slept with our tents open so we could see it , and the tents face the volcano so we could see the explosions in the night			0
" orphaned gorillas find a safe haven @entity61 says he felt very at ease while on the trek despite the warnings about the region			0
" there are a lot of people walking around with guns , a lot of people walking around with @entity108 , carrying rocket launchers ... but obviously , if the national parks are confident that they can provide a safe experience then it 's safe , " he says			0
" the rebel activity that is causing instability is not targeted at tourists			0
it is not really targeted at the rangers either			0
" he added : " i think that there will be a lot of interest ( in volcano trekking ) so now i just have to spread it out and get it out there that we can do this			0
" the impoverished @entity6 country also made its debut at the @entity135 in @entity136 in september this year , signaling to the world that it means business when it comes to boosting tourism revenue			0
in its efforts to promote tourism , the @entity4 government , in conjunction with the @entity143 pour @entity146 ( @entity147 ) , has recently launched a tourism visa that can be obtained online through @entity10 's website for $ 50			1
@entity4 borders @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 at the junction of the @entity155 region , but despite the country 's more varied biodiversity , @entity150 and @entity152 generate more revenue from the gorilla tourism trade , because of the instability in the area according to analysts @entity163			2
many governments currently warn their citizens against traveling to the @entity4 due to extreme security risks as a result of continued military activity			2
however , @entity169 , a tourist operator in the area , describes the @entity4 as a place of adventure			2
the company wrote on their website : " no one goes there to rest and sit in a chair for a couple of weeks			0
@entity4 is an experience and asks for active people ... if you really need ( five star ) lodges , whisky on the rocks and your 20 - channels television , please go somewhere else			2
" national park experts are unsure how long the volcano will continue to erupt , spraying vibrant lava and rocks into the sky			1
the @entity10 , a world heritage site has eight volcanoes that spread across the @entity195 mountain range , but only two are currently active			1
the 7,900 hectare site is also home to critically endangered mountain gorillas			1
" the area where the eruption is taking place is an area that has been affected by eruptions for around two - and - a half - years ... our mountain gorillas do n't live in that area			1
they are about 50 kilometers away so they are completely untouched , " says @entity10 development officer @entity207 said .			2

@entity10 in the @entity4 is *inviting* tourists on overnight treks to see an erupting volcano
eight volcanoes are found in the *vicinity* of the national park but only two are currently active
surrounding *wildlife* , like the endangered mountain gorillas , are out of harm 50 km away
