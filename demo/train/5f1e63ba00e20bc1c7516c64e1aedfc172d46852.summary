-- editor 's note : @entity0 's @entity3 regularly attends an annual @entity5 ball which celebrates the birth of the @entity7			1
he wrote this essay about the event last year			1
the old theater looks like the one in @entity11 -- the one where @entity12 and @entity13 sing " putting on the @entity14			1
" every seat is taken , and the air is filled with a weird mix of anticipation and familiarity			2
and maybe a faint hint of mothballs			2
i 'm in the mezzanine this year , sipping champagne and jammed into a tuxedo that 's undeniably smaller than it was last november			1
behind me , a retired general is singing @entity28 , along with the rest of the crowd			2
he is singing louder than i am , and i 'm singing as loud as i can			2
and that 's saying something			1
the anthem ends , and we take our seats			2
the champagne is cold in my hand , and as i look around i see that i 'm not the only one to have liberated a flute from the lobby bar			2
i take a sip , and observe the scene onstage			2
like last year , and the year before that one , and the five years before that one , i 'm transfixed by what i see			2
ten @entity7 in full ceremonial dress march out from the wings to the sound of trumpets and drums			1
they move like a synchronized machine , forming two parallel lines perpendicular to the audience			2
they stand 10 feet apart , staring straight ahead like statues in a deadly gauntlet			2
they do n't blink ; they do n't smile			0
they just stand there looking dangerous as hell			0
then , a command is barked out			0
ten swords are drawn as one , catching the light on their blades and sending it flashing through the audience like a thousand lasers			0
if dr. @entity69 's infamous creature were in the vicinity , i suspect he 'd crap his pants			1
@entity72 , the @entity73 enters , connecting the two lines at the top			0
they face the crowd directly - the @entity78 and @entity79 , flanked by two riflemen			0
under the hot lights , the @entity81 are radiant , and the @entity83 glows like a crimson beacon			0
they 've been standing there for the last half hour , frozen in time , as the events of the evening unfold			0
sometimes , that 's the job			1
to watch , as events unfold around you			0
the @entity7 is 238 years old today , and last night , i helped them celebrate in @entity5 the same way i do every year			1
i attended their annual ball , ate a piece of their birthday cake , and assisted them with the important work of closing down the bar			1
in between , there was dinner and dancing and all the stuff you might expect to find at a formal ball			1
there were speeches and toasts			0
and there were tributes of courage and sacrifice so unimaginable , you can only shake your head and marvel at the character of some			0
i met the oldest @entity7 present - 95 - and drank a beer with the youngest - 21			1
i swapped some jokes with a @entity121 that i ca n't repeat			0
) and i chatted with some @entity124 parents , who spoke proudly and movingly about the sons and daughters they lost			0
for me , the whole affair is just so damn humbling			1
a kid with two purple hearts and three tours of combat comes up to me and says , " holy cow , @entity133 , how did you ever do all those @entity135 ? what was the worst one ? " a sniper with stories that would haunt your dreams listens wide eyed as i answer his questions about crab fishing on the @entity144			0
and a combat medic who has saved more lives than he can remember wants to talk to me about his @entity147			1
it 's the same thing every year , and every year i 'm surprised all over again			1
these @entity7 seem completely unimpressed with their own acts of valor			1
their modesty and their courage seem to exist in parts both enormous and equal			0
they 'd rather talk about other things			1
about the world in general			0
about the things they fight for			1
which of course , makes them all the more magnificent			0
really - what can you say about people like that ? for now , i 'll go with @entity171			0
maybe next year i 'll come up with something more insightful			0
@entity173 , @entity7 , and thanks			1
and of course , a very happy @entity177 , to all who serve .			0
