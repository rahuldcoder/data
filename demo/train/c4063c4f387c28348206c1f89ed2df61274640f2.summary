@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity1 national security official has called for demonstrators to be arrested following deadly weekend anti-government protests in @entity0			1
soon afterward , an opposition web site reported a wave of arrests			2
" the undignified and disruptive behavior of the rioters is no longer tolerable for our people , since they have brought undignified behaviors to new heights by offending sanctities and values held dear in @entity21 and @entity1 , " @entity9 , a member of the @entity11 and @entity10 , told state - run @entity12			1
" @entity22 must swiftly arrest the rioters who committed those crimes			0
" an opposition web site , @entity26 , said government officials took several activists into custody monday , including some close advisors to opposition leader and former presidential candidate @entity32			0
the government did not immediately respond to the report			0
meanwhile , the death toll from sunday 's anti-government protests in @entity0 stood at eight , the country 's @entity35 said			1
are you in @entity1 ? share your photos and video and tell us what 's going on			1
with tight restrictions on international media , @entity2 could not independently verify the casualties that were reported monday by state - run @entity47			1
the @entity47 report did not say how many others were arrested			2
but earlier , @entity1 's deputy police chief @entity50 said on state television station @entity51 that more than 300 were taken into custody			1
opposition web site @entity53 reported the arrests of at least three figures from the reformist movement and also noted that @entity0 's text messaging system had slowed to a crawl with the outbreak in violence			1
the toll was the result of clashes that broke out between demonstrators and security forces as large crowds gathered for @entity68 , a major religious observance that marks the death of @entity71 , grandson of @entity72 , as a martyr			1
some demonstrators over the weekend compared @entity75 -- the supreme leader of the nation 's hardline @entity21 government -- to @entity78 , the caliph who killed @entity71			2
@entity50 said those killed included one person who fell off a bridge and two others who were killed in a car accident during the protests			0
one of the victims was killed by a bullet , @entity50 said			0
but " considering the fact that the police did not use firearms , this incident is extremely suspicious , and is being investigated , " he added			2
@entity32 's web site reported that his nephew , @entity95 , was killed in the demonstrations by a shot to the heart			1
@entity47 late sunday quoted unnamed police officials as identifying one of the dead as " @entity102 " but it did not mention the elder @entity32 or any relationship between the two men			2
@entity0 police chief @entity105 denied that any protesters were killed by security forces			1
police did not fire any shots in @entity0 , " and security forces were not in possession of firearms , " @entity105 told the semi-official news agency @entity112			2
the state has also said it believes some of the videos may have been staged in order to make the government look bad			0
the @entity118 web site of state - run news agency @entity12 led monday with a story about @entity1 's president , @entity121 , planning a visit to @entity123			1
of about 20 headlines on the main screen of the web site , none mentioned the protests			0
since the disputed presidential elections in june , protesters have turned public gatherings into rallies against president @entity121 , who was declared the overwhelming winner of the race			1
@entity2 's @entity135 , an @entity1 native who covers the region , has called recent events an unprecedented uprising , presenting " the most significant challenge " the @entity21 republic has faced since its government came to power through a revolution 30 years ago			1
" its strength , its power over these past 30 years has been repression , has been intimidation of anyone who 's dissented , " but the government has n't managed to quell this rebellion , @entity135 said			1
" and you look at this opposition movement , and you have to ask yourself how			0
they do n't have a strong leader			0
they do n't have a structure			0
they do n't have an organization			0
but somehow they manage to mobilize and move out			0
" the unrest sunday followed day - long clashes between the two sides in the streets of @entity0 on saturday			0
on saturday evening , a pro-government mob barged into a mosque where former president and reformist leader @entity167 was speaking			0
the dozens - strong group forced @entity167 to end his remarks abruptly when it interrupted the gathering at @entity173 mosque			0
the protests also came as @entity1 were mourning the grand ayatollah @entity175 , a key figure in the 1979 @entity1 revolution			1
@entity175 went on to become one of the government 's most vocal critics			0
@entity181 , president of the @entity182 in @entity183 -- a public critic of @entity1 's hardline government -- told @entity2 's " @entity189 : " i think this may actually turn out to be a breaking point			1
what we 've seen here is how the opposition , six months after the fraud in elections , still have a lot of fight in them			0
" i think they 've taken the @entity1 authorities by surprise			2
they 're still coming out in huge numbers , and morale seems to be stronger amongst the opposition than among the security forces at this point			0
" " this could very well end up being one of those indicators that this is not just going to end -- this is going to go for something that can be causing a dramatic change , not only in @entity1 but in the region as a whole			2
" -- @entity2 's @entity216 contributed to this report			1
