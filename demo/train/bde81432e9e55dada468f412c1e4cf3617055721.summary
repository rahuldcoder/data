-- i ca n't remember exactly when i began reading @entity2			1
i 've been flipping -- now scrolling -- its pages as long as i can remember			2
like family , it 's just always been there and helped form my perspective			1
that 's why it was so troubling for me when a senior editor of the esteemed magazine , @entity13 , recently went on a @entity15 tirade against black @entity16 , failing to uphold the standards that i 'd come to expect from @entity2			1
" i care about nothing you have to say , " she wrote while disparaging conservatives and @entity16 in general			0
this was not the @entity2 i 'd grown up with , i thought , the @entity2 i 'd worked with , that encouraged political discourse and diversity of opinion			1
to my relief , the next day , @entity2 issued an apology for its editor 's actions after receiving a letter from @entity32 chairman @entity31			1
" @entity2 strongly believes in the marketplace of ideas , " the editors wrote in their response			1
any good publication allows for diversity of thought			1
any good journalist should be able to listen to all sides of an issue			0
she should not resort to the virtual equivalent of putting her fingers in her ears			0
as a conservative black woman , i understand i 'm in the minority of a minority			2
but i challenge all of those who disagree with me to listen to what my party has to say			0
are your opinions based on hasty assumptions ? or were they formed after reasoned debate ? we do n't have to agree on every issue			0
but we ca n't claim to be informed citizens if we refuse even to hear another perspective			0
and it 's never been more important for us to be informed than at a time when our political clout as black @entity66 , especially black women , is growing			1
in last year 's gubernatorial race in @entity69 , where i live , black women turned out to vote at a rate higher than other demographic groups , according to exit polls , just as we did in the past two presidential elections			1
it 's in our interest to understand the full spectrum of political ideas			1
most black @entity66 only need to ask a parent or grandparent to hear stories of when the opinions , views and voices of blacks were silenced , not because of what they said but because of who we are			2
some of us have experienced that bigotry firsthand			0
how can any one of us , then , be so quick to refuse to listen to others ? if you take the time to listen , you might be surprised at what you hear			0
ask a @entity32 about education policy , and you might learn that she is fighting to ensure school choice is the right of parents to choose the school that 's right for their kids , regardless of their zip code			2
yes , @entity16 agree with the majority of black parents			2
if a black female entrepreneur asked a conservative about economic policy , she might learn that republicans at every level of government are fighting to streamline regulations so that she can grow her business faster , hire more workers and keep more of what she earns			1
yes , @entity16 are fighting for her , too			0
if the young black millennial who 's looking for work asked a @entity32 congressman what he 'd done for him lately , he 'd hear about the 40 jobs bills that the @entity32 - led @entity123 has passed but the @entity126 - run @entity124 has refused to consider			1
yes , you might be surprised			0
in the course of my career , i 've worked as a journalist and held editorial management positions at a number of media outlets			0
objectivity and balanced coverage were demanded ; personal views could not and did not interfere with a reporter 's duty to tell the full story			2
that 's because journalism and political discourse must make room for a diversity of opinions			1
the " marketplace of ideas " can sort out what 's right , wrong , persuasive and not			1
and it wo n't be the same for every person			0
but for me and many others , conservative policy solutions offer more financial freedom , greater religious freedom and more economic opportunities			0
and if you ca n't understand why , well , that 's all the more reason why we need to engage in meaningful political discussion			2
join us on @entity163 / @entity162 .			0
