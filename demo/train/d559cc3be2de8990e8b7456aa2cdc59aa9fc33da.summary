-- an operation to retrieve two @entity4 hostages held by the @entity6 rebel group will resume tuesday , the @entity1 said , but the government denied that it had authorized such a move			1
the conflicting reports come two days after an initial attempt to retrieve the hostages was foiled by inaccurate coordinates			1
@entity13 , the @entity1 representative for the operation , said that the release of police maj. @entity15 and @entity18 cpl. @entity17 by the @entity6 or @entity6 will happen in the department of @entity20 on tuesday morning			1
but shortly after these comments were reported , the @entity4 government said in a statement that " it is not true that we have authorized the resumption of any operation for the liberation of the hostages			1
" the government was awaiting a debrief from the @entity1 before moving forward , the statement said			1
@entity15 , @entity17 , and police officer @entity32 were to be released by the @entity6 on sunday , but only @entity32 was freed			2

" even though the government did its part , the @entity6 have committed an act that shocks us , " said @entity41 , the government 's representative for the liberation operation			1
" today , the @entity6 gave us coordinates in the department of @entity48			2
the helicopters went to those areas , and it turns out that the hostages are n't in the department of @entity48 , but in the department of @entity20			0
" he added that " this behavior surprises , upsets and disturbs us very much			0
" in december , the @entity6 leftist guerrilla group pledged to release five hostages as a humanitarian gesture			0
three of them were released last week , and two others had originally been scheduled to be released sunday			1
however , former sen. @entity63 , who helped to coordinate the humanitarian mission , later said that the rebel group would release three hostages sunday			2
some have suggested the hostage releases could fuel renewed negotiations between @entity71 's government and the rebels			0
one of the freed hostages called for dialogue between the government and insurgents			2
" humanitarian exchange is the first step toward a friendly understanding , which permits the return of our brothers deprived of their liberty , " politician @entity77 said after his release last week			0
