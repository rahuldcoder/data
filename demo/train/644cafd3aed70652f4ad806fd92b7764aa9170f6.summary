crude oil futures topped $ 112 a barrel in wednesday 's intraday trading in @entity19 -- up from about $ 35 a barrel before the 2003 invasion of @entity4			2
though @entity4 's oil exports have yet to top prewar levels , the price rise has meant a $ 6.4 billion surplus for the @entity4 government , according to the @entity28 's last quarterly report on the war			1
with the five - year - old war 's cost to @entity6 taxpayers estimated at more than $ 600 billion , the @entity4 windfall provoked sharp questions from @entity35 during two days of testimony by the top @entity6 officials in @entity4 , gen. @entity38 and ambassador @entity39			1
" this nation 's facing record deficits , and the @entity4 have translated their oil revenues into budget surpluses rather than effective services , " rep. @entity40 of @entity41 , the @entity42 chairman of the @entity43 , said wednesday			2
" under these circumstances and with a strategic risk to our nation and our military readiness , we and the @entity6 people must ask : why should we stay in @entity4 in large numbers ? " rep. @entity56 , @entity57 , proposed the @entity4 government pay the cost of stationing @entity6 troops in its country under any future agreement between @entity0 and @entity11 -- and said he would introduce legislation to require that			1
" the @entity6 government and the people of the @entity6 have paid an awful price , " @entity56 said			0
" it 's time for the @entity4 to pay that price for their own protection			0
" @entity39 said @entity4 has allocated $ 13 billion for reconstruction projects in 2008 and plans to add another $ 5 billion this summer			2
the @entity6 focus will shift to improving @entity4 's economy at the local level and expanding its export capacity , he said			2
" the era of @entity6 - funded major infrastructure projects is over			1
we are seeking to ensure that our assistance , in partnership with the @entity4 , leverages @entity4 's own resources , " he said			0
five years after @entity11 fell to a @entity6 - led army , many @entity4 still lack basic services such as water , sewer connections and electricity			1
nevertheless , foreign minister @entity85 said the government is " doing its best " to spend money to improve the country			0
" i think the government has a responsibility , definitely , to care for its people , to provide services and to use the oil money for reconstruction and development , " @entity85 said			0

the agency , the investigative arm of @entity35 , concluded that @entity4 's oil revenues could top $ 100 billion in 2007 and 2008			1
when president @entity105 announced he was dispatching almost 30,000 additional @entity6 troops to @entity4 in january 2007 , he told @entity6 that @entity4 would spend $ 10 billion on reconstruction projects and pass a law allocating the country 's oil wealth as steps toward a political settlement of the war			1
the @entity100 , however , found @entity4 had spent only 7 percent of that budget by november 2007 , and the proposed oil law has stalled in the country 's fractious parliament			0
deputy prime minister @entity118 blamed the ongoing insurgency and the " socialist command economy " left behind by ousted dictator @entity121 for the slow pace of reconstruction			0
" at the time we were trying to reform it , open up the system , when we are faced with the terrible challenge of @entity128 and this tornado of terrorism afflicting the society day in , day out , " @entity118 said			0
" people should not be too judgmental			0
" but sen. @entity133 , @entity41 , said tuesday the issue is " a burr in the saddle of the @entity6 people " -- particularly since @entity105 administration officials told @entity35 before the invasion that @entity4 could finance its own reconstruction with oil revenues			2
rep. @entity142 of @entity143 -- a @entity144 opponent of the war -- pointed out the @entity6 " is borrowing money from foreign governments to pay our bills " while oil and gas prices have more than doubled			1
" the issue is that we in this @entity35 are going to be cutting programs to help our elderly with health care , " he said wednesday			0
" the @entity6 people want to know that the @entity4 government understands that we do not have treasure and blood to go on and on and on			1
