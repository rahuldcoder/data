@entity0 lost her bid friday to have @entity3 's top court reverse its ruling that held the former dental assistant did not suffer gender bias when she was fired for being " irresistible			1
" the @entity7 stood by its december finding that dr. @entity8 was legally able to fire the assistant after his wife became concerned about the relationship between the two			1
@entity8 's conduct was not sex discrimination in violation of the @entity16 , the court said			1
the all - male court had previously ruled against @entity18 , finding that employees who are seen as an " irresistible attraction " by their employers can be fired in such circumstances			1
read the court 's ruling ( @entity25 ) @entity18 worked for @entity8 in 1999 and stayed for more than 10 years at the @entity27 business			1
toward the end of her employment , @entity8 complained to @entity18 her clothing was tight and " distracting , " the court said in its first ruling			1
@entity18 denied her clothes were inappropriate			2
at one point , @entity8 told @entity18 that " if she saw his pants bulging , she would know her clothing was too revealing			1
" at another point , in response to an alleged comment @entity18 made about the infrequency of her sex life , @entity8 responded : [ @entity48 ] hat 's like having a @entity49 in the garage and never driving it			1
" @entity8 would occasionally ask @entity18 to wear a lab coat , the court said in its friday ruling			1
during the last six months of @entity18 's employment , @entity18 and @entity8 , both married with children , started sending text messages to each other outside of work			2
neither objected to the texting			0
@entity8 's wife , who was employed at the same dental office , found out about those messages in late 2009 and demanded he fire @entity18			1
in early 2010 , he did just that			0

justice @entity75 wrote friday that the court , in reconsidering the case , found that the firing of @entity18 " did not amount to unlawful discrimination			1
" he said that @entity18 's arguments warranted serious consideration , but the court found a distinction between an employment decision based on personal relations and one based on gender itself			2
" in the former case , the decision is driven entirely by individual feelings and emotions regarding a specific person , " said @entity75			0
" such a decision is not gender - based , nor is it based on factors that might be a proxy for gender			0
" " while the loss of a job is often devastating to an employee , and at times unfair , these considerations do not play a role under our employment - at - will doctrine , and our exceptions to this law , such as sex discrimination , are only based on the underlying discriminatory motivation of the decision maker , " said @entity75			0

" up until now , courts were the only thing standing in the way of employers like @entity8 getting away with violating the civil rights of their employees , " @entity114 said in a statement			0
" now men can protect themselves from sexual harassment claims simply by firing women they 've been harassing			0
" after the court 's initial ruling in december , @entity8 's attorney said a ruling against his client would " ignore every other case we could find " with similar facts			2
" he and his wife really agonized about it , " @entity135 said about @entity8 's decision to fire @entity18			1
" he did n't want to terminate her			0
" chief justice @entity140 , in a concurring opinion friday , said @entity8 and @entity18 developed a consensual personal relationship			2
" it is undisputed that this relationship extended well beyond the workplace			0
@entity18 and dr. @entity8 communicated with each other outside the workplace on matters extraneous to the employment			2
their relationship was personal and closer than the relationships dr. @entity8 maintained with the other employees , " @entity151 argued			0
