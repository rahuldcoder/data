-- the @entity2 have been forced out of power , @entity1 is dead , and @entity5 , by many accounts , is not nearly as powerful as it once was			0
but 10 years after the start of the war in @entity9 , many issues still plague the country			1
insurgent violence remains a major problem , as the @entity2 have regrouped in recent years			2
questions also persist about the long - term viability of the @entity9 government led by president @entity16			1
@entity18 president @entity17 has said that combat operations in @entity9 will end by 2014 , but the country 's future is still very much in the air			1
where will @entity9 be 10 years from now ? @entity0 asked five people -- either @entity9 or @entity9 experts -- to explain what they think is the most important thing needed for a successful @entity9			1
here 's what they had to say			0
@entity29 : disperse power to the provinces @entity29 is a professor and the chairman of the international relations department at @entity34			0
he recently wrote " @entity35 , " which examines @entity18 foreign policy			0
after a decade fighting the @entity2 , the @entity18 still faces a resilient insurgency , one that will neither surrender nor pursue serious negotiations			0
but the @entity2 's tenacity is not the main problem ; it 's that @entity9 overwhelmingly ( and rightly ) regard president @entity16 's regime as irredeemably inept and corrupt			1
battlefield successes against the @entity2 wo n't matter unless an @entity9 government emerges with the capacity and legitimacy to govern			1
the @entity18 can scarcely remake the @entity9 government			1
but it can goad @entity16 to disperse power to the provinces			0
if locally elected politicians with grass - roots support replace central - government appointees , the @entity2 will find it harder to operate			0
simultaneously , the @entity18 should accelerate the training of @entity9 security forces			1
it should be doing its utmost to help @entity9 build the most effective military and police force possible			1
this is the most feasible strategy given the enormity of the problem and paucity of time			0
anything more ambitious is wishful thinking			0
calls to get tough with @entity68 are commonplace			0
but squeezing @entity68 would generate a backlash in a country already rife with anti-americanism			2
besides , it would n't work			0
@entity73 : we must unite as a nation @entity73 is an @entity9 ireporter living and working in @entity77			1
he is also studying at the @entity79 , majoring in political science and public administration			0
the most important thing @entity9 must do is prioritize the idea of one nation -- a nation without tribal , ethnic or other differences			1
until we are united under one identity , we wo n't be successful in the future			0
in order to have a legitimate government with the participation of large segments of the population , the government has to unite the people			0
the government also has to work with the nation 's interests at heart and not their own			0
the importance of governance at the local and regional level is very important ; therefore it is vital that power is shared among all groups equally			0
and high - level government positions should be appointed on merit , not corrupt political deals or non-transparent criteria			0
the system must also work to exclude the involvement of warlords in the system			0
none of them has knowledge or the experience to be a part of this system , but most of them are actually running it now			0
in the long run , @entity9 has to transform from a centralized model of governance to a decentralized one			1
that way , every province can come up with creative ideas and further build the bond between the communities and the government			0
@entity131 : defend basic human rights @entity131 , @entity133 's @entity9 researcher , has more than 15 years of experience advocating for human rights , justice and gender issues in @entity9			1
in 2007 , she brought victims of war crimes to testify before @entity16			2
she is also a survivor of human rights abuses in @entity9			1
hopes were high in @entity9 following the international intervention 10 years ago			1
but since then , human rights gains have been put at risk by corruption , mismanagement and attacks by insurgent groups who have shown systematic contempt for human rights and the laws of war			2
today , many @entity9 dare to hope for improvements in human rights in their country : to be able to go about their lives without fear of attack , to have access to basic services , education and work			1
for women , there is also the hope that they will have genuine and meaningful representation in policy and decision - making			0
for success , it 's imperative that the @entity9 government and its international supporters back these hopes with concrete action to defend them			1
there have been many international conferences on @entity9 , much talk , and new benchmarks for success have been discussed and set many times			1
yet a lack of success -- rather , many failures -- has not been acknowledged or properly remedied , either by the @entity9 government or its international partners			1
an @entity133 scorecard on the state of human rights in @entity9 has found some progress in enacting human rights laws , reducing discrimination against women and increasing access to education and health care			1
however , progress on justice and policing , human security and displacement has faltered			2
civilian deaths are increasing , and @entity9 living in areas heavily affected by the insurgency have seen a serious deterioration in their living conditions			1
the @entity9 government 's international allies , including the @entity18 , have repeatedly said that they will not abandon the @entity9 people			1
for success in @entity9 , they must stand by this commitment and ensure that rights are not swept aside as the international community seeks an exit			1
@entity216 : education , development can help fight extremism @entity216 is an @entity9 journalist on the editorial board of the @entity221 , @entity9 's first independent @entity222 - language newspaper			1
his views can also be found on his blog , @entity225			0
@entity9 is a war - ravaged country that has gone through three decades of crisis and chaos			1
for all those years , governance has been nonexistent			2
there has also been a lack of socioeconomic structures			0
so @entity9 can not become a model society overnight			1
of course , peace and security are the utmost requirement to @entity9 's future success , but there are other major factors to consider			1
we have not had a stable political system for the entire history of @entity9			1
we have never had a peaceful transition to power , just bloody coups and assassinations			0
during our entire history , the strongest rulers in @entity77 have never had control over all parts of @entity9			2
we need a viable alternative , decentralized power and a continued movement toward a democratic system that assures long - term political stability in the country			0
only a stable and democratic system can ensure good governance and socioeconomic development , which is the remedy for most of @entity9 's problems			2
religious fanaticism , a root cause of militant extremism , is a product of ignorance and illiteracy			0
it can be fought through education			0
@entity269 : @entity9 must feel empowered @entity270 is a faculty associate at the @entity271 at @entity272			2
a successful @entity9 requires a more pronounced shift away from the rhetoric and reality that is still underlying some policymaking			2
instead of " fixing " or " patching " @entity9 , there should be an increased focus on empowerment , particularly at the local and regional levels			2
empowerment should center on creative strategies and tactics designed to transform the conflict : facilitating economic self - sufficiency , reducing corruption and creating sustainable local and national governance institutions			0
this is about the @entity9 building something from the bottom up and being able to set and meet goals so their expectations for the future are realistic and are n't frustrated			2
this is about security -- theirs and ours			0
an empowerment approach must unfold with the understanding that @entity9 is a complex country partly because of its diversity			1
with differences in ethnicity , religion , tribes and clans , careful planning will have to ensure that one particular group does n't have an unfair advantage over another			0
it will also need to give due consideration to the influence of @entity9 's neighbors , some of whom do not play well with one another and want to manipulate @entity9 politics for their own ends			2
history has taught us that the @entity9 can not , and indeed should not , be controlled			2
over time , empowerment places responsibility and accountability with the @entity9 people for their own affairs -- where it should be .			2

it has been 10 years since the start of the war in @entity9
progress has been made in the country , but some issues still remain
