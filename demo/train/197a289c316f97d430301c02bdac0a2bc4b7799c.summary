a gift shop set to open to the public on wednesday at the @entity2 has sparked controversy among some victims ' families			1
among the items sold : hats emblazoned with the @entity9 symbol , search and rescue stuffed - dog animals and a slew of books relating to the attack and building of the memorial			2
organizers of the museum acknowledge that the cost of operation , about $ 65 million yearly , will require the support of revenue generated from the gift shop , and the museum 's admission fees , with $ 24 for an adult			1
it will also help maintain the free admission to the museum 's outside memorial			1
" to provide an opportunity to buy a keepsake and have those proceeds support this open and free memorial is something i would do seven days a week , " said @entity31 , president of the @entity33 september 11 @entity32			2
he says the gift shop is situated in a " respectful space " in the museum and notes that the no. 1 sellers so far are the dvds and books they sell that educate the public about the history behind the events of september 11			1
but some in the 9/11 community are bristling at the idea of monetizing their families ' final resting places			0
" i think it 's a revenue - generating tourist attraction , " @entity54 said of the museum			1
riches , who is retired from the @entity9 , lost his son , a firefighter , in the attacks			0
" basically , they 're making money off of my son 's dead body			0
i think that 's disgusting , " @entity54 said			2
also at issue ? the roughly 8,000 unidentified human remains that will be housed in the museum			0
@entity54 likens the accompanying admission fee to " charging people to get into a cemetery			1
" " let 's bring the remains up to a respectable location ... above ground with an eternal light			0
everybody can visit them , you wo n't pay $ 24 to get in there , " he said			0
but @entity79 , a member of the museum 's board of directors who lost his son @entity82 , a firefighter , in the attack , hopes that the revenue generated will help maintain the museum			1
" we have an obligation to society ... 20 years from now , we need to make sure the people that step foot on this plaza know where they 're stepping and when they go into the entrance and go into the museum , they need to know what they 're going to see there , " he said			0
tragedy turns the mundane into memorial			0
