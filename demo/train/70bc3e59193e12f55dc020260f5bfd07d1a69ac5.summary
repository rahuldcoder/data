-- when most @entity2 think about heroic efforts that save lives and keep communities safe from gun violence , i suspect they picture someone with a badge , gun or bullet - proof vest who , with similarly equipped colleagues , busts down doors in pursuit of criminal thugs			1
i salute the fine officers who arrest violent criminals , but there is another kind of hero dedicated to preventing homicides and shootings			0
@entity23 called attention to him , and others like him , in a recent article			0
in part , it recounted the story of @entity31 , 34 , of @entity32 , who is a convicted felon turned outreach worker			1
@entity31 goes into the most violent neighborhoods in @entity32 to keep people with histories of gang involvement , criminality and violence from shooting at each other			1
@entity31 and his street outreach colleagues have no weapons or means of protection other than their reputation , authenticity and skills as " violence interrupters			1
" they help settle disputes peacefully , but they also are much needed role models and mentors who steer youth away from gangs and toward opportunities to live productive , crime - free lives			2
it sounds admirable , what these brave and committed people do			0
but can potential killers really be talked out of their initial violent impulses and intentions ? my experience evaluating @entity32 's @entity67 program , which aims to reduce shootings among people ages 14 - 25 , has convinced me that the answer is definitely yes			1
with the support of funding from the @entity76 , my colleagues from the @entity72 for the @entity73 and i spent the past five years studying the work of outreach workers and violence interrupters like @entity31 , working in four @entity32 neighborhoods that have historically been among the city 's most violent areas			1
each of the intervention sites was in the top 10 % of police posts in @entity32 for homicides and nonfatal shootings from 2003 to 2006			2
three of four neighborhoods in the program experienced reductions in gun violence significantly greater than those in other high - crime neighborhoods that were not involved in the program			1
after outreach staff mediated numerous gang conflicts during the initial five months @entity100 was implemented in @entity31 's neighborhood , the community did not have a single homicide for nearly two years			1
this was a feat that had not been accomplished in recent memory			0
( the neighborhoods had had at least three homicides a year before the program			0
) @entity67 replicates @entity111 's @entity110 program , in which an evaluation showed impressive reductions in gun violence in seven @entity111 neighborhoods			1
the program saved taxpayers the costs of incarceration			0
a common wisdom in police enforcement has long been that cities could curb gun violence through law enforcement crackdowns on drug dealers , since so much violent crime is related to drugs			1
but research has shown that these efforts are actually much more likely to increase than decrease violence			0
government officials have begun to realize that billions of dollars spent fighting a war on drugs has not been responsible for curbing addiction or reducing violence			0
law enforcement efforts targeted at violent gun offenders are often effective and vital to keeping communities safe			2
but public health initiatives such as @entity110 and @entity140 are necessary complements to law enforcement			1
these programs prevent violence before it occurs in the first place			0
homicide is the second leading cause of death for young people in the @entity2 , and the leading cause of death among young black males			0
the social cost of gun violence in the @entity2 has been estimated to be $ 100 billion annually			1
to save lives and reduce these costs , we must invest in effective violence prevention programs			1
regrettably , some communities that have been implementing @entity110 have seen their funding cut and programs eliminated			2
the @entity76 is an important source of funding for such programs and for the research that determines which strategies are most effective			0
in light of this , it is disappointing that last week the @entity2 @entity171 voted to eliminate the @entity76 's entire budget for youth violence prevention			0
this is short - sighted thinking that will keep heroes like @entity31 -- whose job still survives -- from interrupting the cycle of violence in communities across the country and will stall progress toward an array of other efforts to prevent youth violence			2
@entity186 allocates billions of dollars to federal law enforcement against drug traffickers each year			0
by reallocating only a tiny fraction of those funds to continue @entity76 's implementation and evaluation of prevention programs , @entity186 could really have a positive impact on youth violence			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			0

@entity31 is @entity32 outreach worker who helps settle street disputes
@entity198 says programs like " @entity67 " are effective in cutting gun violence
such initiatives , *including* @entity111 's " @entity110 , " complement policing , he says
@entity198 : recent federal cuts will hurt programs ' ability to curb street violence
