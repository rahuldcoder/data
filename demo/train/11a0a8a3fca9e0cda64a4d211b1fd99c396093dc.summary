-- some people might give you the shirt off their back for free			0
others might give you their last name -- for a fee			0
" i just saw an opportunity -- my mom is going through a divorce and i do n't need this last name anymore , " explained 30 - year old entrepreneur @entity8 , who lives in @entity9 , @entity10			1
" i thought ' how am i going to find a new last name ? ' well ' why not just sell it ? ' " to many , the idea of selling off the family surname might be crazy			2
@entity8 says he wants to reinvest the money he makes into other " fun marketing things " and " give 10 % of it to charity			1
" the bidding ended december 13 on @entity8 's website -- buymylastname.com -- and the winning bidder will pay $ 45,500 for @entity8 to change his name to @entity27			1
for all of 2013 , @entity8 will legally assume the new surname decided by the winning bidder and will need to change all official forms of identification			1
the legal process may take several weeks , according to the @entity10 state courts system , and involves submitting fingerprints for a state and national criminal check , the associated cost for processing , a court date to consider the name change request and a judge 's final approval			2
this is not @entity8 's first attempt at a more creative -- if unorthodox -- moneymaking scheme			1
in 2009 , the entrepreneur started wearing the shirts of other companies , serving as a walking ad space for a day			2
he pulled in more than $ 66,000 on top of his regular day job that first year			2
that start - up still operates today at @entity52			0
watch : human advertising in space @entity8 , interviewed earlier in the week by @entity0 , rejects the idea that he is selling out			1
" the reason i say that is that i do n't want this last name anymore			1
the name @entity8 does n't mean anything to me anymore			1
and for me i want to work with a brand			0
i live in this kind of online marketing world and i 'm very passionate about it			0
if i said i 'll take any casino or pornography site -- that would be selling out			0
" @entity8 set some guidelines before the winning bid			1
" i had some legalese written up			0
if you read the terms and conditions -- nothing political , nothing religious , nothing defaming anybody			0
there 's been a lot of talk on the internet about giving me a dumb last name			0
it 's just not going to happen			0
i have the last right of refusal			2
" beyond 2013 , @entity8 says he might do it over again and represent someone new or just " pick a random name from the phone book			1

new : winning bidder pays $ 45,500 to change surname to " @entity27 "
@entity94 entrepreneur @entity8 will assume new last name for 2013
@entity8 : " @entity98 going through divorce , i do n't need this last name anymore "
*highest* bidder gets to name @entity8 but legally *retains* " last right of refusal "
