-- one of the @entity2 's great promises is that it 's the ultimate democratizer			0
it 's open to everyone and allows all people to communicate			0
@entity7 and @entity8 have added new translation tools , but they take different approaches			1
but , so far , there have been several hitches in that plan			0
not everyone has access to a computer and a broadband connection			0
some governments still censor the @entity2			0
and of course , we do n't all speak the same language			0
for the @entity23 to be truly global , should n't @entity22 speakers be able to chat online with people who only speak @entity25 ? and why should an @entity27 speaker be barred from reading blogs written in @entity29 or @entity30 ? @entity7 and @entity8 are two web companies trying particularly hard to make this happen , and they 've released a number of updates to their translation services in recent weeks			1
the two online giants are going about the process in different ways			0
@entity7 aims to translate the @entity23 using an army of volunteers and some hired professional translators			2
meanwhile , @entity8 plans to let computers do most of the work			2
which method will ultimately prevail remains to be seen			0
but for now , here 's a look at the latest language features from both companies , and some background on how their translation services work			0
( feel free to add your own @entity2 translation tips -- and fun translation bloopers -- in the comments section at the bottom of the story ) : @entity7 's human translation many tech bloggers think @entity7 's method of human translation seems promising			1
after all , the @entity61 - born social networking site introduced non-english languages for the first time only in january 2008			0
now about 70 percent of @entity7 's 300 million users are outside of the @entity61			2
how it works : real people are at the heart of @entity7 translation plan			2
they suggest translated phrases and vote on translations that others have submitted			0
these crowd - sourced edits -- which work kind of like @entity73 -- make @entity7 's translation service smarter over time			1
go to @entity7 's translation page to check it out or to participate			2
size : more than 65 languages function on @entity7 now , according to @entity7 's statistics			2
at least another 30 languages are in the works , meaning @entity7 needs help working out the kinks on those languages before they 're put to use			2
what 's new ? @entity7 announced in a blog post on september 30 that the social network has made its crowd - sourced translation technology available to other sites on the @entity23			1
the update allows sites to install a translation gadget on their sites through @entity94 , a service that lets @entity7 users sign in on other web pages			1
@entity7 also added some new languages , including @entity99 and " pirate , " which translates the @entity102 word " share " as " blabber t'yer mates ! " pros and cons : people are good at knowing idioms and slang , so @entity7 tends to get these right , but there are limited numbers of multi-lingual volunteers who want to spend time helping @entity7 translate things			1
also , @entity7 's site is available in many languages , but its human translators do n't touch wall posts , photo comments and other user - submitted items , which is a big con if you want to have friends who do n't share a common language with you			1
people who use @entity94 to translate their sites can choose which text they want users to help translate , according to @entity7 spokeswoman @entity130			1
@entity131 , founder of whereivebeen.com , said he 's excited about @entity7 's translation application , but it would be too much to ask his site 's users to translate user - submitted material			1
@entity8 's ' mechanical ' translation @entity8 uses mathematical equations to try to translate the @entity23 's content			1
this fits in line with the company 's mission , which is to organize the world 's information and make it useful and accessible to all			0
how it works : @entity8 's computers learn how to be translators by examining text that 's already on the @entity23 , and from professional web translations posted online , said @entity154 , a principal scientist at @entity8			1
the more text is out there , the more @entity8 learns and the better its translations become			0
the search - engine company currently translates documents , search results and full web pages			0
size : @entity8 claims to be the largest free language translation service online			1
it covers 51 languages and more than 2,500 language pairs			1
the site 's interface has been translated , with the help of @entity8 users , into 130 languages			1
what 's new ? : @entity8 recently created a widget that any web developer can put on his or her page to offer up @entity8 translations			2
so , say you 're a blogger who writes about music			0
you might get some @entity182 readers if you offered up a button to translate your site into @entity185			0
@entity8 also recently unveiled a translation service for @entity187 , which lets anyone upload a document to the @entity23 and have it translated into a number of languages for free			1
and there 's a new firefox add - on from @entity8 to help people translate the @entity23 more quickly			2
@entity154 said real - time translation of @entity2 chats is on the horizon , as are more languages and increased quality as @entity8 's computers get smarter			1
pros and cons : @entity8 's computerized approach means it can translate tons of content -- and fast			0
but computers are n't quite up to speed with ever - evolving modern speech , so reports of translation errors are fairly common			0
on the plus side , the service has been vastly improved in the last five years , @entity154 said			0
also , @entity8 lets people spot translation errors , suggest new wordings and translate its interface into languages @entity8 's computers do n't speak just yet .			1
