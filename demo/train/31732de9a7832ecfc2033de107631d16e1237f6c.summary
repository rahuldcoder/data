-- @entity2 users , take note : @entity4 — a long - overdue app for creating lists and reminders — has arrived			1
keep is essentially @entity9 's answer to @entity10 and the post-it			2
believe it or not , while @entity14 's @entity13 has had a @entity16 app and a @entity18 app baked in for some time now , keep is @entity9 's first mobile app focused on solving either of these problems			2
as you 'd expect , keep is integrated with @entity22 , the cloud storage service @entity9 wants anyone who uses anything it makes to use			1
you can type out a reminder or list using the keep @entity2 app , which landed in @entity29 on wednesday ( after leaking for a bit monday ) , or on the web at @entity22 / keep			1
aside from tapping out a note , you can also store photos in the app , and you can record voice notes , which keep then transcribes into text , so you can read or listen to them later			2
if you snap a photo in the app , you can then edit it using all of @entity2 's built - in camera features ( cropping , color balancing , photo filters and borders )			1
using @entity2 's sharing features , you share a photo by e-mail , text messaging , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and even @entity57 's send to @entity59 feature			1
this being a @entity9 product , there 's also a search function , so you can find the keeps you kept , and you can color code what you 've got in a variety of hues			0
the app sorts everything in a style that is reminiscent of @entity72 or @entity73			0
it looks great and it 's super easy to use			0
want to move a reminder to the top of your mosaic ? just drag and drop , and tap to get in and edit			0
you can also archive or delete any reminder once you 're done with it			0
it 's all pretty painless and feels like something @entity9 should have offered up years ago			0
keep is only compatible with phones and tablets running @entity2 4.0 @entity84 or newer , and as of now , there are no keep apps for @entity13 , @entity87 or any other mobile operating systems			1
if the app takes off ( and it should , because it works well and looks fantastic ) , then we 'd guess that a @entity4 app on @entity13 is only a matter of time			1
after all , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , translate , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and even currents can all be found on @entity13			0
for those using @entity2 4.2 @entity102 , @entity9 has also built a keep widget , which can be placed on your @entity2 homescreen , or on your phone or tablet 's lock screen , which would enable users to add a reminder without even having to unlock their device			2
