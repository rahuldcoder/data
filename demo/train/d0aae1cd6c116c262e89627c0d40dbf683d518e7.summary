@entity0 -- photographer @entity3 's hobby of searching weekend garage sales for collectible toys led him to dozens of apparently unpublished photos of a young @entity7			1
@entity3 has allowed @entity1 to publish the images just days before what would have been @entity7 's 85th birthday			1
they apparently were taken during a photo session before she was well known			0
" i found an envelope of negatives , did n't know what they were , but i realized they were old , " @entity3 said			1
he paid $ 2 for the folder , which contained two envelopes of black - and - white negatives			2
that was in @entity23 , @entity24 , in 1980 , when @entity3 says he was " a fledgling photographer			1
" " i took it home , put them on the lightboard with a loupe and , needless to say , these are @entity7 , " he said			1
" that was probably my greatest garage sale discovery ever			1
" the second envelope was filled with about 70 negatives of actress @entity34			1
@entity3 held onto the photographs for the last three decades , not knowing much about them			0
" the only thing we 're sure of is who , " he said			0
" we do n't know where , we do n't know why , we do n't know when , we do n't know who shot them			2
but we do know it is @entity7			1
" @entity3 flew to @entity0 this week to show the images to @entity44 , a @entity45 art dealer and appraiser experienced with @entity7 photos			1
@entity7 was one of the most photographed women ever , but @entity49 suspects these photos are from her early years , soon after she cut her hair and evolved into the iconic look most people associate with her			2
" i 've looked for early photographs , early test shots , magazine shots , books , and have n't been able to find anything yet , so the mystery we 're just beginning to unravel , " @entity49 said			2
streets ' best guess for now is the photos were taken in 1950 , a breakout year for the nearly unknown @entity7 because of her minor roles in " @entity64 " and " @entity65			1
" " i know they were taken here in @entity0 , " which we know " from the backgrounds that we see in the photos , " @entity49 said			0
" you see @entity73 , @entity75 1950s architecture			0
" there are more questions than answers , though			0
" for me as an appraiser and as a researcher , i want people to call , i want people to e-mail and say , ' this is where it is , this is what it is , this is who i think took it , ' " @entity49 said			0
one clue that could be important is the coincidence of a man seen in both the @entity7 and @entity96 photographs			1
it is possible he was the photographer for both sessions , @entity44 said			0
" we know that @entity7 and @entity96 were here working at the same time , were contemporaries and friends , " @entity44 said			2
" so , there 's an intertanglement there that we 're going to unravel and see where the mystery leads			0
" @entity7 , who would have been 24 in 1950 , wore two bathing suits , including a bikini , and short pants during the poolside photo shoot			2
one risk @entity3 runs as he brings his garage sale find to the public , and possibly for sale , is that someone could make a legal claim to the photos , which are possibly still protected by copyright laws even after 60 years			1
" that 's kind of what we 're trying to figure out , " @entity3 said			0
there 's way more questions than there are answers at this point			0
we do n't know where this is going to lead			0
