it was another december afternoon back in 2000 , spent like hundreds of others combing the rocky hills of the @entity4 region , when @entity6 scientist @entity5 heard one of his assistants nearby calling him			1
" he said ' oh , doctor i see something there , ' " recalls @entity5 , who 'd been excavating the hot and dry landscape for over a year , helped only by a small inexperienced crew of locals			1
" and i went there and i see the cheek bone part ... sticking out of the rock			0
i turned it upside down and my jaw literally dropped			0
" instantly , @entity5 realized this was an extraordinary discovery that could make scientific history			1
" right away i could tell this is a child of a human ancestor , " says the paleoanthropologist			0
" you have this child in a block of sandstone , with the baby teeth still visible , very vertical forehead , small canine , " he adds			0
" but it 's so rare and so unbelievable that i just could n't accept that was the case , that what i saw was the skeleton			0
" read this : civil war survivor creates bionic limbs yet @entity5 did not want to make news of his discovery public until he had a more complete picture of what he 'd unearthed			1
so he kept it quiet as he meticulously prepared and analyzed the fossil			0
" the skeleton was encaved in a block of sandstone matrix , which is very densely compact , very inured sand , so that i had to go remove the sand grain by grain , " says @entity5			2
" so i took my time , and people advised me to employ technicians , and technicians can do that job , but i said ' no , it 's going to take as long as it takes but i 'm not going to delegate this work of the exploration of this unique child to anyone else but me			2
' " @entity5 then spent years in the lab painstakingly picking away the sand grain by grain			2
by using a super microscope , he was able to see details in the teeth embedded in the skull that revealed to him the skeleton 's age and the sex			0
he now knew the fossil was that of a three - year - old girl who had died 3.3 million years ago			1
finally , after more than six long years , @entity5 was ready to present to the world " @entity77 , " the fossil known as " the world 's oldest child			1
" " when the time came to go to the press conference , " remembers @entity5 , " it was like a woman is pregnant and she is holding that baby for nine months and when the baby comes out , what happens is -- in spite of the pain , in spite of the long , tedious process of carrying the baby -- you see her smiling , you see her beautiful wonderful face trying to share the baby with her husband or the doctor			2
" so i shared my baby with the audience but the different thing is that i was sharing a child that belonged not only to me but to humanity , to seven billion individuals			2
" read this : @entity109 midwife , @entity110 ? that press conference in 2006 turned @entity5 , who was just 31 when he 'd discovered @entity77 , into a hero in the world of science			1
over the next few years , his work took him all over the world , winning him international admiration for his achievements			2
today @entity5 is the director of anthropology at the @entity120 , a multifaceted scientific institution and museum where he combines his scientific research with his passion for public education			1
" when i got involved in this type of research i decided to not only read what has already been discovered but also to make my own discoveries and i can proudly say that i have achieved that with the discovery of @entity77 and many other fossils , " he says			1
" those finds are finds that change textbooks , literally , so i am happy but i 'm not satisfied -- i will be satisfied only if i could instill the same type of psychology , the same type of excitement , the same type of passion to the next generations of @entity109			0
" read this : @entity6 town breeding olympians @entity5 , a father of two , enjoys the opportunity to share his findings with the world and possibly inspire a new generation of scientists			1
in recent years , he 's teamed up with other scientists from his continent to create the @entity151 , a group holding regular conferences to bring together top scientists and researchers from the region and beyond			0
and while his achievements have made him a success story that young @entity6 can aspire to , @entity5 's efforts to create a positive impact on young @entity109 are just a small step toward his ultimate goals			1
" i think both my family and @entity6 are proud of me , but i still think that i still have so much to offer , not just to @entity6 , but to @entity109 and to humanity in general , " he says			0
" my work is beyond nations , beyond nationalities , beyond continents -- it unites everyone on the planet			0
so when i achieve that , i 'm sure @entity6 and my family are or will be proud of me and i thank them for all of the opportunities they have provided me with also			0
