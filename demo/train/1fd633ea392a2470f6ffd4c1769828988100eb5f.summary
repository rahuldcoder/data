-- the guns that have ravaged much of @entity2 since march 2011 may fall silent friday , now that @entity2 's government has agreed to a cease - fire			1
@entity2 's government and its main rebel force , the @entity6 , said thursday they would halt military operations during the @entity9 holiday of @entity10 , which runs from friday to monday			1
but the terms of @entity2 's agreement have raised skepticism among some observers : @entity15 reserves the right to respond to " terrorist " attacks , including bombings , as well as " terrorists " trying to reinforce their positions ; and to protect neighboring borders crossed by " terrorists			1
" on the rebel side , a top @entity23 said his fighters had agreed to halt military operations if the @entity2 government were to do so as well			1
but he said he doubted that the truce would hold			0
@entity2 's rebel opposition is fractured , and gen. @entity32 noted that some rebel groups have not agreed to halt operations			1
the @entity35 and the @entity36 , which helped negotiate the truce through @entity36 - @entity39 special envoy @entity38 , welcomed the news , despite the uncertainty			2
@entity42 says she regrets trying to help @entity2 aide " what we are hoping and expecting is that they will not just talk the talk of cease - fire , but they will walk the walk -- beginning with the regime , " said @entity45 spokeswoman @entity44			1
at the @entity36 , secretary - general ban ki - moon " welcomes the reported announcements , " @entity36 spokesman @entity54 told reporters			0
" obviously , the world is now watching to see what will happen on friday morning , " he said			0
" we can not be sure yet what will transpire , but the hope is that the guns will fall silent for the people of @entity2 so that they will have peace and quiet during this holy holiday			1
" @entity36 humanitarian workers , working with the @entity67 , are on standby to provide aid to areas that have not been easily accessible , he said			0
opposition forces said government troops struck rebel targets thursday in the war 's major hot spots , particularly in @entity75 , @entity2 's most populous city			1
the state - run @entity76 reported violence in @entity79 and @entity80			0
at least 106 people were killed thursday amid fighting and shelling nationwide , the opposition @entity81 said			0
at least 36 of them died in @entity15 and its suburbs and 33 in @entity75			0
rebels expressed skepticism over the truce			0
" they have betrayed us many times and they do not care if it is eid or anything else , they will continue to kill , " said @entity88 , the rebel @entity6 spokesman in @entity75			0
@entity10 is a major holiday on the @entity9 calendar			0
it is described as a joyous time of peace as the faithful celebrate the end of the @entity102 , the annual pilgrimage to @entity104 in @entity105			2
the government touted several goodwill efforts thursday leading to its announcement that it will stop fighting			0
state - run tv aired footage of men walking out of a prison -- part of a government amnesty program , a commentator said			2
the release comes a week after rebel fighters told @entity120 news agency that they would agree to a proposed cease - fire only if the government were to release detainees , end a siege in the city of @entity79 and halt aerial attacks			1
as the cease - fire was announced , rebels reported strategic military advances in the city of @entity75			1
@entity2 cease - fire : could it really happen ? the rebel spokesman singled out @entity75 's @entity135 community for permitting the presence of rebels in their neighborhoods			1
much of the opposition is @entity140 , and rebels said they were heartened to receive support from all groups in the diverse society			0
" we were welcomed by the @entity144 because people believe the @entity6 will liberate @entity2 , " @entity88 said			2
" every small gain brings us closer to victory			0
the @entity6 was also happy to unite another facet of @entity2 society under the @entity6 umbrella			2
" previous truces have failed to take hold in @entity2 , which has been wracked by civil war since march 2011			2
in april , a cease - fire lasted barely a day before the killing resumed			1
in total , more than 32,000 @entity2 have died since the conflict began , opposition activists say			2
a spokesman for the @entity160 , an opposition coalition , said the truce is an attempt by president @entity163 to buy time			0
" the whole world knows that the @entity2 regime can not be trusted and does n't have any credibility in fulfilling any promise that they make to anyone , " said @entity165 , a @entity166 - based spokesman for the @entity160 , which speaks for rebels fighting @entity163			1
" the @entity163 regime is trying a diversion			0
" it 's foolish to expect a total cease - fire , said @entity178 , a @entity179 expert at the @entity180 in @entity181			1
a cease - fire in this context is about a larger goal of getting most rebel brigades and @entity163 forces to halt or reduce the killing			1
the rebels themselves are partly to blame for the failure of this spring 's cease - fire , @entity178 said			1
they have been just as vicious in their killing as @entity163 's forces , he said			0
but getting them to work together and resist the urge to fight , he said , is unrealistic			0
meanwhile , the @entity36 ' investigation into alleged war crimes in @entity2 is moving forward			2
the @entity201 - based @entity36 commission investigating war crimes announced thursday it has requested a meeting with @entity163 to discuss gaining access to @entity2 for the team			1
5 things you need to know about @entity208 and @entity2 @entity209 , who once served as prosecutor for the @entity211 for the former @entity212 , is part of the commission			2
noted for her investigation of war crimes in the @entity216 in the 1990s , she cited similarities with past probes			0
" the similarity is , of course , we are handling the same crimes , crimes against humanity and war crimes for sure , " she said			0
the @entity2 government 's isolation continued to grow			1
in @entity230 , @entity105 authorities announced the deportation of three staff members of the @entity2 consulate general , the official @entity228 said thursday			1
the move was taken because " authorities have concluded that their behaviors are incompatible with their consular duties and assignments , " it said			0
attack at @entity2 funeral : ' children 's bodies were maimed and burnt ' @entity0 's @entity241 , @entity242 , and @entity243 and journalist @entity244 contributed to this report .			2
