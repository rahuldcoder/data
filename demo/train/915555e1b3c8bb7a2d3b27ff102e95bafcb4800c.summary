-- @entity2 journalist @entity1 was murdered , beheaded by an @entity4 - speaking member of @entity5 , the extremist group that calls itself the @entity6 and has already conquered large swaths of two @entity9 countries			1
the sickening execution , recorded and released online for the world to see , came with a warning to the @entity2 : @entity5 showed another captive @entity2 journalist , believed to be @entity14 , and threatened to kill him too if the @entity2 does not stop helping those fighting to stop @entity5 advances			1
the killing and the threat , along with all the evidence @entity5 is leaving as it gouges its way across the region , are a direct challenge to the @entity2 people , to the @entity2 government and to the international community			1
as it makes increasingly clear what kind of an organization it is , @entity5 is sending a message : " stay out of this , so we can keep driving toward our objective			1
" president @entity32 said wednesday that " we will do everything we can to protect our people ... the entire world is appalled by the brutal murder			0
" the @entity2 government has crucial steps to take now			1
first , obviously , it can not give into @entity5 threats and must continue helping dislodge @entity5 from northern @entity40 where it is engaging in ethnic cleansing against @entity42 and other minorities ; kidnapping , raping and selling women ; and massacring people			1
the @entity2 effort should keep a special focus on helping @entity2 's loyal and ideologically moderate friends , the @entity49 of @entity40			1
at the same time , the @entity2 should make a strong diplomatic push to obtain international legitimacy for the campaign to defeat @entity5			1
it is important to prevent @entity5 from scoring a recruiting victory among @entity55 and anti-western and anti-american camps by portraying this as a war between @entity60 and the @entity61 , which it is not			1
there are few people on @entity64 who are not horrified by @entity5			1
that includes the overwhelming majority of @entity55			2
the grand mufti of @entity68 , @entity69 , called @entity5 and @entity70 " enemy no. 1 " of @entity60			1
countless @entity55 have criticized and condemned them			2
@entity5 is the enemy of anyone who does not belong to @entity5			2
they kill minorities , @entity55 and @entity77 who do n't abide by their views			2
they are virulently opposed to the @entity61 , to the @entity2 , to modernity and to anyone who sees the world differently from their narrow medieval perspective			1
the @entity2 should seek a @entity85 resolution declaring that the international community , including the @entity88 world , considers isis and its methods repugnant			1
any country that disagrees , any government that is not revolted by @entity5 and troubled by its methods and its goals , should go on record saying so			2
before @entity5 , we knew that human beings are capable of unspeakable brutality			2
but anyone who thought man 's inhumanity to man had eased after the mass crimes of the 20th century now knows better			0
@entity5 did n't just remind us how cruel humans can be ; it has taken the use of brutality as a weapon of intimidation , extermination , genocide and recruitment propaganda to new levels			2
@entity5 is not the first to murder victims in large numbers ; it is not the first to kill those who disagree with its beliefs or who belong to different ethnic or religious groups			1
but it seems no group has advertised its bloodlust with such relish and effectiveness			0
more important , those using these methods , embracing this philosophy , are in control of enormous territories			0
when @entity5 calls itself a state , it is not hyperbole by very much			2
@entity5 has taken over a a tract of land bigger than many countries , something that @entity70 , its comparatively mild - mannered inspiration , never came close to achieving			2
@entity5 has established and gained full dominion not only of cities and populations but of wealthy oil - producing lands			2
it is now financially self - sufficient , collecting millions of dollars every day from oil smuggling operations			0
if not stopped , it could continue its push toward the oil fields of southern @entity40 at the edge of the @entity143 , which remains the epicenter of oil and gas production that allows the global economy to function			2
if @entity148 were n't dead , he would die of envy			0
@entity5 views the videos of mass executions , of severed heads on poles and of crucified men , as a way to keep its enemies frightened and weakened , and a way to tell prospective recruits that it is fearless in its war to create an @entity60 caliphate ruling over all the world 's @entity55			1
its leader , @entity163 , incidentally , claims to rule over all @entity55 and believes the ultimate goal of @entity5 is to take over huge sections of @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168			1
the killing of @entity1 , an idealistic journalist , sharpens our understanding of the organization seeking to dominate the @entity9			0
that the man who murdered him might have been @entity174 should erase any remaining fantasy in the @entity61 that this gruesome war , now raging in @entity177 and @entity40 , will stay within any country 's or any region 's borders			1
those who seek to downplay the risk to the @entity2 should think again			0
@entity174 has confirmed that @entity1 's killer was most likely a @entity174 citizen			0
there have been reports of hundreds , even thousands , of @entity167 training , fighting and killing alongside @entity5			0
in june 2013 , a video from @entity177 surfaced , showing men cutting off another man 's head			0
to the shock of @entity167 , they were heard speaking @entity193			0
the @entity5 members who hold @entity167 passports are able to travel freely across @entity167 and the @entity2 and are prepared to do the unthinkable			1
there are hundreds of @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200			0
graduates of the @entity177 war , from where @entity5 pushed into @entity40 , have killed in @entity167			1
and @entity5 ideology is gaining support in the continent			0
last month , @entity5 flags flew in an anti-israel demonstration in the @entity209 , chanting against @entity2 and the @entity61 and most enthusiastically , " death to the @entity211			1
" @entity5 can simply not be allowed to keep a foothold in the @entity9			0
if it does , the consequences will become even more catastrophic			0
in @entity40 alone , 1.2 million people have been displaced , thousands killed			0
it is politically and strategically complicated , because @entity5 is also fighting @entity177 president @entity217 and @entity218 , and defeating @entity5 would also be enormously pleasing to @entity219			0
but the group is a growing threat			0
the strategy of supporting the @entity49 and the @entity40 in the front lines is a good one			1
it must be bolstered with material and diplomatic support			0
if it proves insufficient to turning back the bloody @entity5 tide , then it must be revamped			0
@entity1 's mother said her son gave his life trying to expose to the world the suffering of the @entity177 people			0
that suffering has now extended to @entity40 , and it will only become more widespread if @entity5 is not stopped .			1

@entity237 : @entity2 can not give in to @entity5 threats , must focus on helping @entity49 of @entity40
@entity240 : @entity85 resolution should declare that @entity55 , rest of the world find @entity5 horrific
@entity240 : @entity2 should make sure this is not framed as a war against @entity60 and the @entity61
she says @entity5 is a threat to the whole world ; *europeans* are *joining* in big numbers
