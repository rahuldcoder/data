editor 's note : @entity3 , @entity2 is an assistant professor of religion and african - american studies at @entity6			1
he is an interdisciplinary historian of religion in @entity8 with a focus on black communities and cultures in the @entity8			1
his research and teaching interests include @entity15 religious history , @entity15 religions , hip hop , popular culture and the arts			1
i 'm lucky enough to have a job that requires me to think , read , write , teach and speak about the intersections of religion , entertainment and popular culture in @entity15 society			1
however , long before i began work as a college professor , i attended a church that placed as much emphasis on entertainment as instilling faith			1
there was a shared sense that the latter goal ( i.e. instilling faith ) depended upon an ability to perform the former task ( i.e. entertaining )			1
i vividly recall the sunday in 1985 my father took me to the church bookstore after service to purchase a copy of the first @entity42 , " @entity43 " by @entity44 , an @entity46 - based youth minister / rapper who became a recurring guest at my church 's annual youth retreats			1
by all accounts , my youth leaders sought to " keep it real " even as their real goal was to keep us " saved			2
" by no means is " @entity43 " great music , but it is certainly memorable			1
i still can recite its lyrics almost verbatim			2
these memories inspire much of my current work			0
i had the opportunity to interview @entity44 while writing my dissertation			0
he shared with me the story of a church where an actual fist - fight broke out as leaders were debating whether to allow him to rap in their pulpit			1
in dramatic fashion @entity44 's experience reveals the common belief that faith and popular culture are ( or should be ) diametrically opposed			1
black churches have always been a place where people have come to sway , to dance , to shout and -- value judgments aside -- to be entertained			1
to be moved by the spirit			1
in short , there are multiple layers of meaning at the source of what brings folks into " the @entity85			0
" churches were the first independent black institutions			1
they were a place for both worship and politics			0
in addition to serving as arbiters of things spiritual and political , church was also a space of pleasure and play : a theater , a concert stage and a dance hall			1
many prominent black cultural institutions and artists began in churches			1
the @entity104 and the @entity105 both held their first practices in churches			1
@entity15 music legends @entity109 and @entity110 began their careers in the church , as did contemporary artists @entity114 and @entity115			1
to this day , a common thought is that all black entertainers come out of the church			1
yet few acknowledge that the church was and is a source and site of entertainment			2
in today 's tabloid - driven , scandal - obsessed celebrity culture , people are reluctant to reconcile the seriousness of a " @entity128 ! " with the sensationalism , sensuality and sometimes downright silliness of @entity132			2
the writer @entity133 captured this phenomenon well in a short story that appeared in what is considered the bible of the @entity138 , @entity139 's 1925 anthology " @entity140			0
" @entity133 tells a tale of two young men in 1920s @entity143			0
debating whether or not to attend a local revival , one of the men ended their exchange as follows : " ought to be a pretty good show when some o ' them old - time sisters get happy			0
too early for the cabarets ; let 's go in a while , just for the hell of it ... @entity156 ' funny 's bound to happen			0
you might even get religion			0
" clearly , for these men , a revival was as much about pleasure as it was about the promise of salvation			0
to be sure , this illustration fails to capture all of the many motivations that fill church pews			2
yet it suggests that recreation and religion are fundamentally intertwined			0
@entity133 's @entity170 , of course , holds a special place in @entity15 cultural history			0
yet his stories are not solely about race or place			0
rather , they show black churches to be exceptional even as they are quintessentially @entity15			1
recent public debates around black liberation theology often portray black churches as occupying an alternative universe			1
african - american @entity183 breathe the same cultural and political air as their churchgoing brothers and sisters of other races			0
this is perhaps no more clear than in the realm of aesthetics			0
most of the fastest growing black churches have adopted the praise and worship format that has long been popular in white evangelical and charismatic congregations			1
a prime case of this is @entity199 's " breathe , " a remake of the @entity202 standard , " this is the @entity203			0
" more generally , the history of entertainment in the @entity8 can not be told without holding a special place for protestant @entity207			0
this is especially the case for @entity15 evangelicalism , beginning with the @entity211 tremendous revivals of the 18th and 19th centuries , which facilitated the first large - scale embrace of the @entity183 gospel by african - americans			0
in the 20th century , one recalls figures like @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 , the list goes on ad infinitum in black and white			2
these preachers possessed a powerful stage presence			0
each was also a media personality with a popular radio and / or television show			2
theirs is the same history that helped produce a tradition of black religious broadcasters from @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 to @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236			2
before @entity236 's popular " @entity242 " dvd or @entity240 's " @entity241 " network , there was @entity244 's " @entity245 " weekly television program			2
and long before these three there was @entity248 's " @entity249 " radio show			0
in addition to preachers and their sermons , there is sacred music from @entity256 's gospel blues to the holy hip hop of the cross movement			2
there is film : @entity261 's " within our gates " ( 1919 ) to @entity235 ' " @entity262 , " ( 2004 )			0
and there is theater : @entity268 ' " @entity267 , " to @entity270 's " @entity269 "			0
@entity270 's plays , movies and sitcoms always offer dramatic morality tales , and they are never short on the rich biblical rhetoric of the black @entity183 vernacular			2
the appeal of these clerics and religious celebrities is attributable as much to their entertainment value and media savvy as it is to their spiritual acumen			0
collectively , they comprise a veritable black @entity183 culture industry , complete with countless commodities and commercial opportunities			1
this is not meant to question the authenticity of any minister or ministry			0
rather , it points to the evolving interplay between churches and the matrices of markets , media and culture , a complex set of networks that includes the arts and literature , television and digital technologies , music and movies , fashion and finance			1
black churches continue to provide a place where @entity15 - @entity8 go to pray and receive prayer			1
to hear and to speak " the word			0
" to fellowship and to feel the spirit			2
and , ultimately , to feel their best , right in the here and now			0
this is , and always has been , the story of the black church .			1

@entity3 : there is a belief that faith and popular culture are diametrically opposed
black churches have always been places to be entertained , moved by the spirit , he says
music legends , contemporary artists got their start in the church
