@entity0 joined fellow @entity2 side @entity1 in the final of the @entity4 by completing a crushing 7 - 0 aggregate win over @entity6 in the @entity7 wednesday			1
leading 4 - 0 from the semifinal first leg in the @entity9 , @entity0 ruthlessly pulled apart a @entity6 side missing their talisman @entity11 , who sat out the second leg on the bench			1
after a goalless first half , a fine @entity15 strike , a @entity17 own goal and a @entity19 header ended any lingering hopes of a @entity6 comeback in a 3 - 0 victory for the visitors			1
home coach @entity25 decided against risking his star asset @entity11 despite him scoring in the weekend win over @entity28			1
@entity11 injured his hamstring in their quarterfinal tie against @entity32 and has been nursing the problem the last few weeks , cutting an often forlorn figure in @entity35 in the first leg			2
without his creative influence , the @entity38 champions in waiting were first kept in check then dismantled by a @entity0 side reaching their third @entity4 final in the past four years			1
the previous two appearances have seen defeat to @entity45 in 2010 and @entity46 last year but they will start favorites at @entity48 on may 25 against @entity1			2
with the @entity51 title already wrapped up and an appearance in the @entity54 final against @entity55 on june 1 , coach @entity49 will be looking to sign off as @entity0 coach with a treble triumph			1
former @entity6 coach @entity58 takes over at @entity0 next season , doubtless relishing the task on the evidence of their comprehensive defeat of his former charges in the semifinal			1
@entity15 came close to breaking the deadlock in the first half , but delayed his shot			2
when given a second chance just after the break the @entity75 international , a former @entity71 player , cut inside to beat @entity72 with a curling shot			0
@entity77 set up the further goals , first bursting clear down the left in the 72nd minute to see his cross turned clumsily into his own net by @entity17			2
four minutes later a similar run left @entity19 to head home at the far post and complete the rout			0
all the time @entity11 sat glumly on the bench as the task became hopeless even for his genius			0
teammate @entity17 reflected on one of the worst reverses in the history of a proud club			0
" perhaps it was the bitterest night i have had at @entity6 , " he told @entity94 television			0
" we tried but they scored a goal very early in the second half and this left us broken			0
the last 25 minutes were very difficult			0
" @entity15 , by contrast , is already looking forward to the final against their arch @entity2 rivals			0
" to win 4 - 0 and 3 - 0 away , especially the 3 - 0 here , it is amazing , " he told @entity104			1
" now we are in the final for the third time in four years and it is time to win this thing now			0

@entity0 into @entity4 final with 3 - 0 win over @entity6
@entity15 , a @entity17 own goal and @entity19 second half scores
aggregate 7 - 0 win over @entity6 who left injured @entity11 on the bench
all - @entity51 final between @entity0 and @entity1 on may 25
