while president @entity1 discussed the need to fix the nation 's immigration problems during his inauguration speech last week , sister @entity0 is already doing something about it			1
she was all smiles at wednesday 's grand opening of @entity10 , a " green " affordable housing development that will give @entity13 farmworkers unprecedented access to a safe and healthy place to live			1
" i dream a lot , and people all think i 'm nuts when i tell them what i intend to do to help , " said @entity16 , a member of the @entity17			2
" but when they see events like today and realize i can help make it happen , this is wonderful			2
" hired farmworkers continue to be one of the most economically disadvantaged groups in the @entity28 , according to the @entity29			1
studies show they also face higher than average occupational hazards as well as a poorer health status overall			1
many live in substandard housing without access to refrigeration or safe water			1
typical homes are filled with mold or pests			2
few have safe spaces for workers ' children to play			1
@entity16 vowed to change that trend			2
" health is a major issue where many of these families currently live " -- sets of trailers , she said			1
" the water alone is a real problem			2
they are n't on city water , and the health department has to go out there two and three times a week to test it because it has n't always been safe for them to use			1
" trailer living is n't cheap , either			2
many are charged $ 35 per person per day , she said			2
with two and three families living there , the rent costs more than many luxury apartments			2
" it 's outrageous , " @entity16 said			2
the housing situation became much worse in 2004			1
that 's when @entity71 ripped through @entity72 , @entity13			1
working with @entity73 to provide food and clothing to these workers immediately after the storm , @entity16 said she saw firsthand how devastating it was for the community			1
" the little bit they had , they lost , and their deplorable living conditions got even worse , " she said			2
" the trailers that did survive , they put together			2
they had blankets for roofs and cardboard for walls			2
some 800 farmworkers were displaced			1
" baby boomer nuns help revolutionize health care @entity16 said she had never written a grant application in her life , but she knew she would need to raise the money , so she learned			1
she did know how to find the right location for better housing for the workers			1
that 's because at age 60 , she went back to school to earn her real estate license			2
she had been handling all the real estate transactions for the @entity107 since 1999 , but then @entity71 struck			2
that 's when @entity73 hired her away to help the district recover from the major amount of devastation			1
building @entity10 became their first project			0
it took 7Â½ years to gather enough money through donations and successful federal and local grant applications , but she eventually raised the $ 10 million to build the affordable housing			1
" it was providence , " she said			0
she got the land from a family of real estate agents who have been in @entity72 for more than 100 years			0
the property owner , @entity16 said , told people she was " like a dog with a bone " and called her " the @entity128 of the @entity17			0
" " he 's right , i did talk him out of a lot of land , " @entity16 said , laughing			0
" it 's about 20 acres			0
" the land will help house more than 50 families in single - family three - and four - bedroom homes with two bathrooms			0
the homes come equipped with dishwashers , a range , a refrigerator , a microwave , a garbage disposal and a full - sized washer and dryer			0
they are sturdy homes built to stand up to 200 mph winds			0
" i was taking an inspector through who said they would be the safest residences in the county , " @entity16 said			0
" they 'll also be some of the nicest many of these families have ever seen			0
" " i was taking a family on a tour , and one of the young women who had her grandmother and 2 - year - old in tow said to them , ' ooh , this is a real house , ' " buster said			0
" when she saw the washer and dryer she said , ' how much is this going to cost to do your laundry ? ' i told her it wo n't cost anything			0
' but does it take quarters ? ' she asked			0
i told her there are no slot machines			0
these are yours to use			0
i ca n't wait to see people 's faces when they move in			0
" the property has parks and a playing field big enough for a soccer game			0
" another family touring the grounds asked , ' are the children allowed to play out here ? ' i told them they can do anything they want			0
they are safe here , " @entity16 said			0
the grounds will also house a community center with a computer lab , a space that will offer @entity197 classes , monthly health check - ups and health classes			1
there will be an after - school program and on - site day care			0
the homes will rent for about 30 % of a family 's income			0
to be eligible to live in them , at least 50 % of the farm laborer 's income for the previous 12 months must be from a farm laborer occupation , and each member of the family must have @entity28 citizenship or proof that they have been legally admitted for permanent residence			1
programs like this are a huge help to the health of the community , according to @entity222 economist @entity221 , who specializes in agricultural issues			1
he co-wrote a study that found that " adverse living conditions significantly increase the probability of gastrointestinal , respiratory and muscular problems			0
" it also adds to a worker 's stress level , which can lead to depression and other mental health complications			1
" even the more conservative economists who have looked at these kind of measures say to reduce the negative effects of child poverty , a project like this ends up paying for itself in the long run , " @entity221 said			0
" you basically eliminate a lot of costs to society that they would face down the road if there was no intervention			1
improve the conditions in which they live by changing cramped and unhealthy settings for healthy ones -- and those families will tend to do much better			0
" " having access to healthy housing is a very difficult problem for a lot of farmworkers			1
that really is something that is bellow the radar , " said @entity260 , who works as a consultant on migrant health issues and has won several awards			1
" this development is what i 'd call a wonderful kind of experiment that i believe will result in a safe , affordable and decent housing model -- one that i 'd like to see a much larger commitment to from the government , philanthropy and the private sector			1
it 's crucial to the health and well - being of these workers			1
she already dreams of expanding			0
she wants to raise more money to build a kitchen that she has already designed in the community center			0
down the road , she 'd like to build affordable senior housing for low - income residents on the property			1
" these families have worked and struggled all their lives , " she said			0
" we can help them realize their dream , which is the @entity28 dream , i want to provide as many people as i can with a safe place to call home			1
