-- @entity1 have left all other @entity3 teams trailing in their wake in recent years , and now it would seem the reigning drivers ' and constructors ' champions are also the quickest in the pit lane			1
the @entity10 @entity9 was overshadowed by a @entity1 row which saw @entity12 ignore team orders , overtake @entity14 and clinch his first race win of the season			1
in addition to taking the checkered flag , the @entity1 team say they clocked the quickest pit stop in the history of the sport			1
@entity24 @entity14 's second stop at the @entity25 was timed at just 2.05 seconds , with @entity1 claiming to have broken the record on five separate occasions during the race			1
prior to 2013 's second race , the record was held by @entity31 , who changed the tires on @entity35 's car in 2.31 seconds at last year 's @entity36 @entity9			1
" we went under that in @entity10 with @entity42 's first stop being 2.13s , " read the @entity39 - owned team 's website			2
" @entity14 's first stop , two laps later was also 2.13s			2
" the crew then lowered the new benchmark to 2.05s when @entity14 came in again , and his two subsequent stops were 2.21s and 2.26s			0
" these times are all taken from the car data which each team uses to record the stationary times			0
" @entity1 went on to suggest the record could be lowered once again in the future			2
" what you wo n't hear , however , is anyone using the word ' perfect ' , " said the team 's website			0
" there 's always a quicker stop out there , and it 's possible this season we 'll see the magical two - second barrier breached at some point			0
" however , rather than chasing individual times , improving consistency is always the thing coveted by the crew : breaking records is merely the consequence of doing that well			0
" the 2013 season continues with the @entity72 in @entity73 on april 14 .			0
