@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 is about putting on a 90 - minute show every other weekend at locations the world over			1
@entity9 's huge ' brand center ' motorhome dominates the @entity10 at all @entity12 grands prix			2
but getting that show on the road -- and in the air and on the sea -- is a remarkable feat of well - oiled logistics and organization			1
with an @entity3 team clocking up around 100,000 miles ( 160,000 km ) between tests and grands prix , the need to have moving and packing down to a fine art is imperative			1
" once the calendar is released , we sit down with all the different departments , " explained @entity26 team manager @entity25			2
" we look at the dates for the freight , the dates for the trucks leaving , when we want to have the people there and when we want to have all the equipment there			1
then we go away and arrange it			0
" as @entity3 moves further away from its @entity12 heartland , more races -- such as next week 's title shootout in @entity41 , @entity42 -- are what are known as ' flyaways			1
' they are the responsibility of @entity48			0
freight company @entity49 has specialized units in @entity0 and @entity51 to coordinate the transport of cars , equipment and fuel to all @entity3 tracks around the world by air , sea and land			1
around 300 tonnes or 20,000 individual items of @entity3 material -- from race cars , replacement parts , pit equipment , tv equipment and the furnishings of the @entity68 -- are moved for each grand prix			1
each team is allowed 22 - 24 tonnes of freight , plus their cars , which is packed in specially designed pods at a @entity76 - based team 's hq and transferred to @entity77 by road			1
three chartered @entity80 freighters then fly to the destination and the next time the team sees its freight is at their allocated garage at the circuit			1
at the end of the race the process starts again in reverse , with a team packed up by around 10pm			1

if there are two weeks between races , as is the norm , the cars will return to the @entity76 to be painted , re-built and polished			2
' double - headers , ' races that take place only a week apart , rule this movement out -- then getting the cars from one circuit to the next is the sole focus			2
while last - minute deliveries can be made in under 24 hours , it takes seven weeks for equipment to travel by sea from @entity12 to @entity108 , @entity109 for the traditional season curtain - raiser			1
cheaper sea freight has become more popular to move bulkier items such as heavy electrical cables			1
@entity114 , the grid 's tire supplier , are among those who have increased their shipping in recent years			0
" we send about five - and - a - half tonnes by sea and we send this three months in advance of each race , " said @entity119 race team coordinator @entity118			1
" it costs around $ 9,000 to send it by sea -- that 's a fraction of the air freight cost			1
we 've made some huge savings by doing this			0
" the @entity12 races are a little more straightforward			0
up to four $ 2m team - liveried articulated lorries are driven to continental grands prix , carrying up to 37 tonnes of equipment each for around 18,600 miles ( 30,000km ) per year			1
three trucks will also go to a two - car test session			0
they carry all the kit the team needs for the weekend , including the cars , engines , parts , tools , computers and radios			1
it takes two days to fully load the trucks after cleaning and maintenance checks , using an 80 - page checklist			0
nothing is left to chance			0
they leave a week before the next race , get to the circuit late on a monday and by thursday , the team 's working area is ready for the drivers			2
it takes eight hours just to fit out the team 's pit area at the circuit			0
motorhomes , the standard of which is set by @entity9 's gargantuan ' brand center ' , also travel to @entity12 races			0
they provide a place for drivers to debrief with their engineers , team members to refuel and corporate guests to be entertained			0
@entity175 's race team includes 15 engineers , 35 mechanics / technicians , 15 ' truckies ' , 11 motorhome / catering personnel , two logistics personnel , 10 marketing and pr staff , three drivers , two managers and two physios			2
this is why motorhomes supply around 1,250 meals for the team and its guests during a race weekend			2
" obviously our sponsors ' backing is crucial			0
it 's not just a matter of having their name and logo on the car -- we have a marketing team that helps to service their needs , " added @entity118			0
occasionally , at places like @entity207 , where the traffic between the circuit and downtown @entity211 is horrific , drivers can also spend their nights in the motorhomes			0
but normally , a fleet of about 20 vehicles is required to ferry team personnel between their hotel -- block - booked months in advance -- and racetrack all weekend			0
as far as @entity25 is concerned , how a team performs during a race weekend can be influenced by its logistical set - up			2
" quite often you have very long days , you have people working late into the evening and it 's an important part of our responsibility to create the atmosphere for people to be able do their job , " he added			0
it takes a herculean effort and millions of dollars to make sure 20 cars circulate for 90 minutes every two weeks			0
but you would never know it .			0

@entity3 uses air , sea and land to transport huge amounts of freight to each race
teams must *meticulously* coordinate their shipping plans each season
team trucks carrying cars and equipment cover almost *19,000* miles per year
