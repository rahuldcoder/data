@entity0 has a problem that affects tens of millions of @entity2			1
if left untreated , it could lead to the death of someone she loves , someone who 's part of the family			1
@entity0 ' dog @entity9 , a black and gray mixed breed , is obese			2
according to a new study , he 's emblematic of a growing problem			1
the majority of adult dogs and cats in @entity2 homes are overweight or obese , and the problem has gotten worse over the past year , according to the @entity18			1
fifty - three percent of adult dogs and 55 % of cats were classified as overweight or obese by their veterinarians			1
" i did n't notice the weight creeping on -- it was like all of a sudden he was just this fat dog , " @entity0 said as she and @entity9 visited @entity25 's @entity24			1
" his weight is about 82 pounds right now , and he should be 62 pounds			1
" that means he needs to lose about a quarter of his weight -- equivalent to a 200 - pound person needing to lose 50 pounds			1
the reason is pretty simple : " too much food and not enough exercise , " @entity0 said			0
@entity36 : ' there is no stopping this fatty ' the @entity40 report shows not only that more pets are overweight , but also that those with the problem " are getting fatter , " said @entity43 , the group 's founder			1
the annual study , to be released next week and given in advance to @entity47 , found that 25 % of cats and just more than 21 % of dogs are obese			1
both those figures are up slightly from 2010			0
about 41 million dogs and 47 million cats are overweight or obese , the study found			1
a long list of health dangers comes with the excess weight			2
" it 's not a matter of if , it 's when " serious complications will strike , said @entity43			0
these can include high blood pressure , " crippling arthritis , " diabetes and some cancers			0
" their life is shortened by two or 2Â½ years , " said @entity43 , a veterinarian in @entity65			0
the @entity69 's @entity68 , which cites the association 's annual study , said the diseases seen among obese pets " are eerily similar to those reported for people			1
" a central part of the problem , the pet obesity group found , is the growing " fat pet gap : " more and more owners are unaware their pets are overweight			1
the study found that 22 % of dog owners and 15 % of cat owners characterized their pets as normal weight when the animals were actually overweight or obese			1
" in simplest terms , we 've made fat pets the new normal , " said @entity43			1
in many cases , the problem correlates to the obesity epidemic among people , he said			2
" this is the sentinel for childhood obesity			0
when i see dogs who are overweight , i see a child that 's at risk for excess weight , because nobody 's exercising			1
the kid 's playing video games all day , the dog sits around all day , " and " everybody 's eating poorly			2
" @entity0 said she needs to shed some weight , too			2
" we 'll do it together , " she said			0
the fact that obesity has struck her dog is particularly telling			2
@entity0 does some work as a dog trainer			2
" to have a dog this heavy when you know better ... is embarrassing , " she said			2
but she has a lot of company			0
thirty - nine percent of @entity2 households own at least one dog , and 33 % of households own at least one cat , according to the @entity125			1
the pet obesity survey was conducted at 41 veterinary clinics across the country and included evaluations of a sampling of more than 600 animals			2
" over the five years studied , these results have proven to be consistent and increasing at a gradual pace , " the association said			0
while the obvious advice -- eat less , exercise more -- is the right starting point , there 's more that pet owners should understand , @entity43 said			1
@entity36 : dog packs on 60 pounds pet foods these days are " more calorically dense " than they used to be , yet owners are feeding their pets more , he said			1
if you 're concerned your pet may be obese , it 's important to work with a veterinarian , and not try to tackle the problem on your own , said @entity43			1
" diet is not about starvation or deprivation			0
it 's about gradual weight loss			2
" in many cases , carefully measuring food and committing to exercise can do the trick			0
but more severe cases need more extensive work			0
@entity36 : fat cat makes floors creak that 's what helped @entity165 's dog , @entity166			1
in february 2006 , he weighed a whopping 187 pounds			1
" i swear , we did n't overfeed him ! " @entity165 said of @entity166 who , like @entity9 , is a rescue dog			1
" we would try giving him smaller and smaller portions of his regular food and he kept gaining and kept gaining			0
" a series of tests found nothing wrong with him , but " at a certain point when he had become so obese , he could n't exercise at all			0
we would try to walk him a little bit and he would just stop , " said @entity165 , cfo of a business in @entity180 , @entity181			0
a veterinarian switched him to " super low - calorie food " and put @entity166 on an underwater treadmill , which he loved			1
" he lost enough that he could exercise on his own and go for walks with us			0
" the energetic @entity166 she loved was back			1
within three years , @entity166 had cut his weight in half			1
there are few truly lost causes , @entity43 said			0
and that 's something critical for owners to know			2
@entity36 : a real - life @entity197 @entity199 of @entity200 , @entity201 , said her sheltie , @entity203 , became so obese from over-feeding that she could n't walk , and her previous owners wanted to put her to sleep			2
the vet refused and gave the dog to a shelter , where @entity199 adopted her			2
@entity203 has lost 30 pounds			2
@entity36 : @entity203 , before and after " it 's hard to believe she is the same dog , " @entity199 told @entity47 in an @entity36 , though @entity203 still needs pills to help with arthritis caused by the obesity			2
cat owners can face more of an uphill climb in trying to get their pets to exercise , @entity43 said			1
@entity218 of @entity219 , @entity220 , said people often remark that her cat , @entity224 -- now nicknamed @entity225 -- " is the fattest cat i have ever seen			1
" @entity218 has tried to get @entity224 to run around like the other two cats in the home , but @entity224 just is n't that interested			0
" cats do n't jog , " @entity43 said			0
" cats by nature are anaerobic creatures			0
that means they use sugar as their primary energy source			0
... they sprint , they pounce , they leap			0
" @entity218 has tried diet cat food and portion control as well , with little results			0
@entity43 recommends families facing trouble work with veterinarians to find ways to bring down the weight			0
in the end , living a life in which you prioritize healthy eating and exercise for all members of the family , including domesticated furry friends , is the key , he said			0
that means no more treats -- " calorie grenades " -- every time your dog does a trick			1
" they want reward , praise , affection			0
we take the easy way out , reach into the cookie jar			0
" it also means snacking on single - ingredient treats like celery , broccoli and asparagus			0
and it means moving to stay healthy and stay alive			0
" unless we really get a grip on this very quickly , " said @entity43 , " we 're going to see an entire generation of pets that do n't live as long as the pets i had when i was a child			0
