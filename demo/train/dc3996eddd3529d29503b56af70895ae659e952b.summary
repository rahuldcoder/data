they dropped the ball , " said dr. @entity13 , director of the @entity14			1
" you do n't want to pile on them , but hopefully this will never happen again			0
... the @entity20 has been vigorously emphasizing the need for a travel history , " @entity13 told @entity0 's " the lead with @entity24			1
" hospital officials have acknowledged that the patient 's travel history was n't " fully communicated " to doctors , but also said in a statement wednesday that based on his symptoms , there was no reason to admit him when he first came to the emergency room last thursday night			1
" at that time , the patient presented with low - grade fever and abdominal pain			1
his condition did not warrant admission			1
he also was not exhibiting symptoms specific to @entity2 , " @entity40 said			1
the patient , identified by his half - brother as @entity45 , told hospital staff that he was from @entity8 , a friend who knows him well said			1

" a @entity4 official told @entity0 senior medical correspondent @entity92 that the situation was clearly " a screw - up			1
" a patient who shows up to a hospital with a fever and a history of travel to @entity8 should be treated as an infection risk , the official said			1

" we know that in busy emergency departments all over the country , people may not ask travel histories			0

after the @entity199 diagnosis , the @entity138 administration is recirculating its guidance about how to respond to the virus , @entity196 spokesman @entity195 told reporters			1

" finding the people the man came in contact with the patient came into contact with up to 20 individuals , @entity199 mayor @entity222 told @entity0			1
a @entity20 team is in @entity199 helping to find anyone he may have come in contact with , @entity102 said			1

learn how @entity2 spreads ebola : 9 things to know about the killer disease air travel testing the @entity2 patient told authorities he flew part of his trip on @entity276 , a spokesperson for the airline said , citing information from the @entity20			0
the airline believes the patient flew from @entity282 to @entity283 and then from @entity283 to @entity284 on september 20 , the spokesperson said			2
" the director of the @entity20 has stated there is ' zero risk of transmission ' on any flight on which the patient flew because he was not symptomatic until several days after his trip and could not have been contagious on the dates he traveled , " the spokesperson said			0
every person who travels by air is screened before departure and at arrival in @entity8 , @entity168 and @entity170 , but because the man says he began feeling ill days after landing in the @entity4 , a screening test in @entity53 would likely have not turned up that he had @entity2			2
however , it 's unclear what kind of screening someone flying from @entity53 might receive when they land in the @entity4 , @entity92 said			2
the @entity0 correspondent and her crew recently reported in and flew from @entity53 , where she said they were screened numerous times for @entity2 by having their temperatures taken at the airport			2
should we worry ? but when they arrived back in the @entity4 , and asked travel officials about whether their temperatures would be taken or whether they 'd be screened for @entity2 , they were given unclear explanations about how the process worked and ultimately were not tested			2
regardless , the @entity20 maintains that passengers on planes with the @entity321 patient were likely not at risk because the man was not displaying active symptoms			2
