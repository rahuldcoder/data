-- @entity1 could hardly believe what he was seeing			1
two of the most recognizable faces on the planet were casually shooting the breeze as they swept down the fairway in @entity8			1
while the @entity11 press pack fumed outside the gates , president @entity9 enjoyed a leisurely 18 holes with the world 's number one golfer @entity14			1
if ever there was a powerhouse pairing , this was it			0
" it was really amazing , " renowned golf coach @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity21 show about that momentous february day when he had a greenside view			1
" if you 'd have told me 20 years ago that a black man would be the @entity25 i would have said you 're crazy			2
" and if you 'd have told me 20 years ago that a black golfer was going to be the greatest golfer that ever walked the planet i 'd say you 're crazy , and there they go			2
" @entity1 is already more than familiar with @entity32 , having played an influential role in his formative years , sculpting the swing that would capture eight major championships by the age of 26			1
he has also coached other stellar names in the world of golf , such as fellow @entity41 @entity40 and @entity43 @entity42 -- both with four majors to their name -- as well as @entity48 @entity47 and @entity49 , the current @entity49 champion			0
but never before in his illustrious career had he been afforded the chance to offer a few tips to the leader of the free world -- himself a golf fanatic			0
the @entity41 president spent hours in a teaching studio at the @entity8 resort , alongside @entity1 's son @entity59 -- also a coach to some of the game 's leading lights -- as they fine - tuned a swing that by @entity1 's evaluation needed some work			1
" president @entity9 loves golf , " he explained			1
" he 's not very good , he 's probably an 18 or 20 handicap , plays left - handed , did n't hit the ball very far with a weak fade but we got him where he could draw and hit about 250 , 260			0
" when he gets out of office in another three years and he has a chance to play , he could probably get down to a 10 or 12 handicap -- but he loves to play and he knows so much about everything			0
he said ' man , i 'm coming back here			0
' " we 'd love to ( have kept ) the film of the lesson we gave him but as soon as he walked out the secret service took everything and they had to watch us delete it all from the computers			0
" in this day and age with the multimedia stuff all over the world , he did n't want it to show up on @entity90			0
" i said to this one secret service guy , ' i actually went on @entity90 to look at the president 's swing and it was terrible , you actually might want some of these shots because they 're better than the ones you have			0
these look pretty good ! ' " the president and a clutch of his closest friends bunkered down at @entity102 for a weekend 's vacation -- his erstwhile secret service detail , naturally , in tow -- on the invitation of the resort 's owner , @entity107			1
@entity107 , owner of the @entity111 baseball team , and @entity41 trade representative @entity112 joined @entity9 for one of his two rounds on the sunday , and making up the numbers just happened to be a 14 - time major winner			1
not that @entity14 is a stranger to the president			1
the 37 - year - old delivered a speech at @entity9 's inauguration back in 2009 , though he has always tried to stay away from politics throughout his career			1
but whether @entity14 is a @entity123 , @entity124 , or apolitical , the invitation to play with the president is not one to be ignored , according to @entity1			1
" in all honesty it does n't matter what your politics are , if you get the chance to play golf with the president -- which is the highest honor in our country -- whether you voted for him or not or agree with the politics , it 's a great honor			1
" when the president drove up and he instantly went right over and said , ' @entity14 it was great to see how well you played at @entity140 when you won the ( @entity142 ) tournament			1
' " he was into it , he wanted to play with @entity14 , he was asking about his swing			1
it was great , it was fun to watch , and it was fun to see it and fun to be part of it			0
" the @entity152 have a rich history of rubbing shoulders with @entity156 power brokers			0
was the last club professional to win a major championship when he secured the @entity162 title in 1948			2
his four sons @entity1 , @entity165 , @entity166 , and @entity167 all became golf professionals and had a keen eye for teaching , just like their father			1
and from a young age they knew that @entity59 's golfing prowess opened some pretty special doors			0
" my father played with so many presidents himself , " @entity1 explained			1
" he played with @entity177 and he played with @entity178 , @entity179 , and i got to play with a lot of them too when i was younger			0
" i think if my father was still alive he 'd be very proud of all of us			0
he 'd be proud of the four sons , he 'd be proud of his grandson because in reality we 're just carrying on what he taught us and what he did and we 're a very proud family			0
" he had the greatest eye i think of anyone that 's ever taught and he saw things that other people did n't see and quickly , he knew how to fix them , he 'd watch you hit five or six balls and he 'd know exactly what you were doing wrong			0
" it was that wisdom passed down from father to son that led @entity1 to believe that the 13 - year - old kid presented to him in 1993 could go on to be one of the greatest players the game had ever seen			2
@entity32 ' father @entity210 had noted the work @entity1 had done with @entity47 and asked if he could bring his son over to hit some balls			2
the session was filmed by @entity1 's young son @entity59			2
" you 've seen the footage , he 's a tall skinny kid in tennis shoes hitting balls and you just saw this natural talent that this kid had , " @entity1 said			2
" i asked him so many different kinds of questions about how do you do this ? why do you do that ? he did n't know it at the time but i was giving him an examination , trying to find out really what ticked in his head , what he knew about golf			2
" the kid was special , he was just a special person you could see it			0
it was no surprise to me that he turned out to be who he was			0
