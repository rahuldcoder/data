-- it was certainly an unprecedented surprise when @entity2 announced -- on 18 october , only a day after its election to one of the 10 rotating seats on the @entity6 -- that it was turning down the chance to participate in the world 's top forum for discussion of international issues			1
after all , the last few years have , if anything , seen an increase in @entity2 's international profile -- particularly as a member of the @entity16 -- and in its regional activism			1
traditionally , @entity2 have preferred to work behind the scenes to promote their vision of regional stability , and to push back against what they see as the growing @entity24 threat			1
they have been the leading proponent of greater @entity28 cohesion -- sometimes labelled as a " circling of the @entity31 wagons " -- and they have recently ensured that a @entity2 will take the top slot at the @entity35 - based @entity34			0
moreover , all the signs had been that they had seriously prepared for their role on the @entity6 , including training their @entity39 team in how best to make an impact			0
so what happened ? the @entity2 statement turning down the seat spoke of international double standards and the international community 's failure to resolve key conflicts , homing in on the @entity49 crisis , the long - running sore of the @entity51 issue , and the failure to achieve a @entity53 free of weapons of mass destruction			1
the @entity2 demanded reforms to the @entity6 , and said they would refrain from membership until that body was capable of discharging its responsibilities to maintain international peace and security			1
of course , many countries outside the magic circle of the @entity64 ( the @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 ) have wanted to see @entity6 reform , and some of the @entity72 countries have themselves worried that the @entity6 's failure to reflect changing patterns of world power -- and the wider ability to open up the government of international bodies to new players -- will inevitably eat into the legitimacy and credibility of the @entity6 and there is no mistaking the anger , however generally slow - burning , in @entity2 and other parts of the @entity87 world about the international community 's failure to resolve the @entity51 issue and achieve the establishment of the long talked about @entity51 state			1
that ire is particularly focused on the @entity92 , above all @entity93 , and is driven by a sharp sense of @entity96 double standards			0
how can it be , the @entity2 ask , that the @entity92 supports self - determination and democracy everywhere except when it comes to the @entity51 ? given the extent of @entity66 aid to @entity103 , surely if the @entity104 were serious the leverage exists to persuade the @entity103 to make concessions ? and how come @entity107 talked such a good talk in his @entity110 speech at the start of his first term , only to fail so spectacularly to deliver ? not far below the surface there is also a sense of @entity2 vulnerability			2
the @entity117 is , after all , an ally of the @entity92 , especially when it comes to anything connected with @entity24			0
so they feel particularly uncomfortable when the @entity24 claim to be the leading flag - wavers of the @entity51 cause , with the message to the @entity87 street that @entity87 leaders are in hock with the @entity92 and only playing lip service to that cause , or have even betrayed it			2
the @entity2 may generally be pragmatic international players , but there is no doubt that the @entity51 cause is for them a sacred one , and that they care deeply about the fate of @entity137 and the @entity138 in particular			1
while one can also point to @entity2 unhappiness with @entity96 policy towards @entity142 , it seems clear that it is above all the @entity2 sense of @entity96 failure over @entity49 which has driven their decision , as it did when @entity2 foreign minister @entity149 declined to address this year 's @entity150			1
at the start of the @entity49 crisis , the @entity2 hoped that president @entity153 would go far enough to meet the demands of the @entity49 people so as to avoid a crisis			1
when @entity153 -- never in any case one of their heroes -- chose repression instead , there was no mistaking the note of genuine moral outrage which came from the very top of the @entity2 system , from @entity166 himself			0
the @entity2 argument that steps should be taken to arm the @entity49 opposition was driven by a belief that those being oppressed had a right to self - defence			2
but they were also keen to prevent a further hardening of the " ' @entity177 " stretching from @entity24 via @entity178 and @entity49 to @entity179 and @entity180			2
i believe nevertheless that they have tried to target their assistance towards non-extremist groups , having learnt better than almost anyone else the lesson of @entity188 resistance against the @entity189 -- that arms in the wrong @entity192 hands will one day become a threat to the @entity117 itself			0
it is however also hard to guarantee in whose hands weapons will end up in such murky situations			0
from a @entity2 perspective , the message the @entity92 and above all the @entity104 have sent through their handling of the chemical weapons crisis is that it is has lost the will to get tough ( a message which they think will not have been lost on the @entity24 ) ; that it lacks consistency ( not all that long ago @entity96 spokesmen would say that @entity153 was toast , and now even @entity208 is praising his government for its cooperation with the @entity212 inspectors ) ; that it is not concerned about the strategic consequences of the conflict and the risk of refugee flows and other pressures destabilizing @entity179 , @entity218 and @entity178 ; and that it lacks morality			1
surely , they would argue , the signal conveyed to @entity153 is that it is acceptable to shoot protesters , but not to use sarin against them			0
they remain to be convinced that the @entity92 will put in a serious effort to achieve a result at the @entity229 conference now scheduled for late november			0
they worry too -- inevitably , and ironically like @entity103 -- that @entity96 limpness on the @entity49 agenda prefigures a willingness to accept a less than satisfactory deal with @entity24 , cutting @entity236 too much slack in the regional strategic equation			1
it could -- and i think should -- have been argued that the @entity2 would have done better to make their voice heard in the @entity6			2
but the shock decision has certainly sent their allies a strong , and public , message about their feeling of betrayal			0
and it is a message to which the @entity92 should listen , if only in engaging with the @entity2 in a more sustained and strategic way			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			0

@entity2 blasts @entity6 , rejects offer to join
@entity252 : @entity2 are deeply *dissatisfied* with @entity6 's handling of regional issues
@entity252 : @entity2 *disappointed* with @entity6 's failure to resolve @entity49 , @entity51 crisis
@entity2 also worried that limp response to @entity49 will lead to *capitulation* with @entity24
