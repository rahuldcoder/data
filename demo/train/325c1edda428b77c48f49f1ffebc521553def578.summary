-- on sunday night , two teenagers called authorities pleading for help after their hike through the @entity5 of southern @entity6 went awry			1
then their cell phones went dead -- meaning that not only were they lost , but so , too , was their link to potential saviors			0
their story took a positive turn wednesday night , when rescuers came across 19 - year - old @entity13			1
but there was no sign of his hiking mate , 18 - year - old @entity16			1
@entity18 shot thursday from helicopters showed @entity16 perched precariously on a steep area full of dense brush			1
a rescuer was by her side , and she was hoisted up to an awaiting helicopter and transported to a local hospital			2
" she is alive , " @entity27 sheriff 's lt. @entity26 said			1
@entity28 did n't offer much more than that as he addressed reporters thursday			0
he said the teenage girl was " responsive , ... she appears to be dehydrated , she 's weak			1
" but the fact she survived four days in the wilderness was cause for celebration			0
@entity26 described her family as " extremely happy " upon hearing about her rescue			0
there was similar elation among the search - and - rescue team , which included dozens of volunteer sheriff deputies who surveyed the dangerous terrain looking for signs of life			0
" regardless of how hard they worked or how how tired or how hungry they are , it 's a tremendous victory for them , " @entity26 said			2
the ordeal began on @entity53 , when the two teens set off on trails in part of the @entity57 located in an unincorporated part of south @entity27			1
the pair called the sheriff 's department that night , and deputies responded , believing the hikers were about a mile from their vehicle			1
" but their cell phone battery died , and contact was lost , " the department said in a news release			0
that set off a frenetic search through an area marked by dense brush and steep terrain			2
a big break came wednesday night , when @entity13 was discovered , but his hiking mate was nowhere in sight			1
" he believed they had been separated possibly since sunday night and has no recall how they got separated , " searcher @entity76 told reporters			2
@entity13 is being treated at @entity82 in @entity83 , where dr. @entity84 said he is " awake and talking			0
" " @entity87 wanted me to convey to all of you ... how grateful he is for all the help , " @entity85 told reporters			0
as to @entity16 , @entity90 with the @entity91 said he heard her before he saw her thursday			2
" so i was screaming , yelling across the canyon , ' can you see me ? ' " @entity90 recalled			0
" ' yes i see you , ' ( she responded ) , and i could not see her yet , because she was on top of a rock behind a bush			0
" @entity90 said he asked @entity16 to wave the one arm she could , at which point he finally spotted her			1
by then , a helicopter was on its way -- from which a paramedic at one point descended to check on @entity16 , and into which she ascended on her way eventually to a nearby hospital			2
" she was in a lot of pain , obviously completely dehydrated , and very weak and going in and out of consciousness , " said @entity110 , also with the @entity91			1
" we just told her not to move because she was in a pretty precarious place			0
" during @entity16 's rescue , an @entity27 volunteer deputy sheriff " sustained head trauma " after falling 60 feet , the sheriff 's department lieutenant said			1
the volunteer was in serious but not life - threatening condition at @entity82 -- " able to move his arms and his legs ... and he is alert , " said @entity27 sheriff 's lt. @entity125			2
@entity127 capt. @entity126 said one lesson from the ordeal -- even with the happy ending -- is that hikers should plan first and plan for the worst			0
" if you 're going to go hiking , we want you to be safe , we want you to prepare , " he said .			0
