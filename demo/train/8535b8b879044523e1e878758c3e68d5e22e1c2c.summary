@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 charged a makeshift goal during friday 's soccer practice			1
the 9 - year - old 's blue and white uniform flapped at her back as she dodged past her teammates through a patch of dirt			2
she tried to score and was stopped short by a defender , before hustling downfield to try again			0
following in the footsteps of her older brother , @entity2 started playing soccer when she was 4 years old , for coach @entity14			1
" i want to grow up and be a professional soccer player , " @entity2 gushed			2
@entity2 and her teammates got together sunday to watch the women 's @entity18 finals with their coaches , who doled out pointers to their players over boxes of pizza			1
gallery : @entity27 final huddled on an oversized couch , the girls cheered on the @entity31 team -- covering their faces during the infamous penalty kick phase			1
@entity14 started coaching the all - girls team in 1998 with only eight players at the @entity36 in @entity0			1
he began first as a volunteer boys ' baseball and soccer coach before launching the girls ' soccer club			1
@entity14 oversees the urban program , whose players are mostly african - americans competing against suburban teams and elite clubs			1
" i do n't recruit and we 're not exclusive , " @entity14 said			1
" it 's not like i went out and picked the girls			1
the program exists because the girls want to play and we happen to be in a predominately @entity51 neighborhood			2
" the @entity52 are named after two very important role models : @entity54 , the great opera singer from @entity0 , and @entity58 's 1945 @entity57 team , the @entity59			1
@entity14 walked away from partnership at a downtown @entity0 law firm to become a fourth - grade teacher at a @entity64 elementary school and to volunteer his out - of - school hours to introducing soccer to urban youth who otherwise might not have a chance to play			1
" i just think everybody should have an opportunity to play			0
there are girls who want to play that may not get the opportunity in many parts of the country , and they can play , and they 're very good , " he said			2
although he has girls who want to play , the team plays with virtually no funding on a borrowed patch of field in urban @entity0 that is overused , dotted with patches of dirt and at times littered with trash and even drug paraphernalia			1
" there would be no team if it was n't for coach @entity88			2
it really is a labor of love			0
he does n't get paid and we can barely afford uniforms , " said @entity91 , whose daughter , @entity92 , plays for the team			2
the players also face other obstacles			0
many hail from neighborhoods that are rife with violence and drug use , that lack access to after - school activities			0
" they deal with the challenges of inner - city living for black girls , and soccer is n't that popular socially , " said @entity2 , assistant coach			1
" we deal with racism , social pressures , but it does teach them about life and brings them closer together			0
" the @entity59 are n't just about soccer			2
grades are just as important as picking up ball - handling skills -- or more so			0
" the idea is to get to college			0
you ca n't play and you ca n't attend a @entity123 school without having the grades , " @entity2 said			0
" this is about a lifestyle change			0
" @entity2 ' two stepdaughters , @entity128 and @entity129 , play for the @entity59			0
his wife , @entity130 , said the program changed her daughters -- who never played soccer before -- for the better			0
" they 're both straight - a students , they have perfect attendance , and soccer keeps them focused , " she said			0
" people should know about the hidden talent in cities across the country and reach people who have never played			0
" the @entity31 women 's soccer team may have lost to @entity145 , but it 's still inspiring this special team of inner - city girls who play soccer on a dusty field in urban @entity150			1
" they just want a chance to play , " @entity14 said			2
" they 're no different than anybody else			0

the @entity158 girls ' soccer team is part of an urban *league* in south @entity0
after *leaving* his legal practice , @entity14 started coaching the girls in 1998
@entity14 got the team together to watch sunday 's women 's @entity18
