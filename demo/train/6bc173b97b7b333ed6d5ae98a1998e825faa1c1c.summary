-- the @entity3 ' defense had a bounty program that paid players for injuring opponents and for making interceptions and fumble recoveries , the @entity1 said friday			1
the program involved as many as 27 defensive players , at least one assistant coach , and was active during the 2009 , 2010 and 2011 seasons , said the league			1
" the payments here are particularly troubling because they involved not just payments for ' performance , ' but also for injuring opposing players , " @entity1 commissioner @entity14 said in a statement			1
" it is our responsibility to protect player safety and the integrity of our game , and this type of conduct will not be tolerated			2
we have made significant progress in changing the culture with respect to player safety and we are not going to relent , " he added			0
@entity14 has received the results of an @entity1 investigation into the @entity3 ' program and will decide on discipline , which could include fines , suspensions and forfeiture of draft choices , the @entity1 said			1
@entity3 owner @entity41 released a statement acknowledging the probe and calling its results " troubling			0
" " i have offered and the @entity1 has received our full cooperation in their investigation			1
while the findings may be troubling , we look forward to putting this behind us and winning more championships in the future for our fans , " he said			0
according to the @entity1 , @entity3 players regularly contributed cash to a pool , the total of which may have been as high as $ 50,000 or more at its peak			1
they were paid $ 1,500 for a " knockout , " when an opposing player was not able to return to the game , and $ 1,000 for a " cart - off , " when an opposing player had to be carried off the field			2
in some cases , particular players on the opposing team were targeted , the @entity1 said			1
the program was administered by then - defensive coordinator @entity68 , with knowledge of other coaches , said the league			1
head coach @entity73 did not directly participate , nor was he involved in the administration of the program , however , he knew about the allegations and failed to stop it , the @entity1 said			1
@entity68 , who is now defensive coordinator for the @entity78 , released a statement on the allegations , the @entity77 reported friday			1
" it was a terrible mistake , and we knew it was wrong while we were doing it			0
instead of getting caught up in it , i should have stopped it			0
i take full responsibility for my role			0
i have learned a hard lesson and i guarantee that i will never participate in or allow this kind of activity to happen again , " the newspaper quoted him saying			2
@entity95 : saints look at severe penalties for bounty system @entity3 players were also allegedly paid for interceptions and fumble recoveries			0
payouts doubled and tripled during the playoffs , the @entity1 said			1
the @entity3 won the @entity104 after the 2009 season			0
" there is no question that a bounty program violates long - standing league rules			1
payments of this type -- even for legitimate plays such as interceptions or fumble recoveries -- are forbidden because they are inconsistent with the @entity115 and well - accepted rules relating to @entity1 player contracts , " said the league			1
it informed the @entity119 about the @entity3 ' investigation earlier friday			0
the @entity119 said it would review the information and stressed that health and safety issues are " paramount			0
" the @entity1 has been under fire of late as hundreds of former players and their families are currently suing the league for alleged negligence , claiming that it did n't do enough to mitigate the risks despite what many say is an inherently dangerous sport			1
an attorney for former @entity135 fullback @entity134 , @entity136 -- whose @entity138 - based firm represents 137 other players and their families who 've filed a class - action suit against the league -- said @entity134 has likely suffered from undiagnosed concussions			2
he accused the league of deliberately withholding information deemed critical to player safety			0
stars such as former quarterback @entity147 , as well as running backs @entity148 and @entity150 , have filed similar lawsuits in states across the country			0
attorneys representing @entity148 and @entity150 accuse the league of having used a " hand - picked committee of physicians " to misrepresent evidence of the effects of head trauma , particularly concussions			2
the league denies the claims and released a statement saying it " has long made player safety a priority and continues to take steps to protect players and to advance the science and medical understanding of the management and treatment of concussions			0
" " the @entity1 has never misled players with respect to the risks associated with playing football , " the statement added			2
" any suggestion to the contrary has no merit			0
" the league has in recent years also made strides to strengthen rules that govern on - the - field conduct , while adding sideline medical staff -- unaffiliated with the teams -- to more independently evaluate injured players			2
in 2005 , the league banned the practice of tackling a player by using his shoulder pads , a move commonly referred to as a " horse - collar " tackle , after concluding it commonly resulted in injury			2
it also strengthened a 1979 rule prohibiting players from using their helmets to butt , or " spear " players during a tackle -- a rule that critics often complained had lacked enforcement .			0
