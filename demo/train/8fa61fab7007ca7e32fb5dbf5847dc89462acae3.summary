-- gaming in 2012 is going to be a very wild ride , with the introduction of two new consoles , a return to the " @entity8 " universe and the potential for even more entertainment choices			1
the @entity9 and the @entity10 are both expected to hit the shelves , with the @entity9 hitting @entity13 and @entity14 shores in february after a @entity16 launch in mid-december			1
the @entity9 is a handheld console and successor to the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) that promises beefier graphics , interactive touchscreens on the front and back , and dual analog sticks much like the @entity25 controllers			1
@entity26 is banking on familiar characters in games like " @entity29 : @entity30 " and " @entity31 " to help draw in customers , while also looking to create unique and immersive games to appeal to the hardcore gamer			0
more than 320,000 units have been sold in @entity16 since the @entity9 's december 16 release there , putting it on nearly even footing with early sales for @entity41 's @entity40 handheld gaming device , the @entity39			1
but the @entity9 's numbers dropped dramatically in the second week to just over 70,000 and analysts are watching to see whether the device has staying power in the @entity46 and @entity14			1
the verdict on whether consumers want 3 - d gaming still appears to be out			0
@entity41 announced tuesday that its @entity39 has sold 4 million units in the @entity46 -- a solid but not spectacular number for a hugely hyped product			1
new consoles later in 2012 , @entity41 will be releasing their next - generation console called @entity10 it is the first @entity41 console to feature souped - up 1080p high - definition graphics and will have a touchscreen embedded in the controller to allow for gaming when the tv is off or interaction between two screens			1
a prototype was shown last year during the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) , and @entity41 president @entity66 said the final version will be revealed at @entity65 this june in @entity68			1
critics are concerned about the potential cost , but @entity41 says it 's confident the @entity10 will open up a new style of gameplay for the home gamer in the same way that the @entity10 expanded the customer base for gaming consoles in general			1
there has also been speculation that a @entity79 from @entity26 or new xbox console from @entity81 could be released in 2012			1
in an interview with @entity84 , @entity85 host @entity82 said many developers are working on new franchises for a new generation of consoles			1
" we 're nearly at the end of a console cycle , so series that have begun at the beginning of the console cycle , they 're starting to finish up the series , " @entity82 said			1
" people have made the investment in the franchise and they 've got the art together and they do n't want to create something completely new when new consoles are starting to be on the horizon			0
" some developers have spoken openly about learning about technology for a new @entity26 console			1
and while there have been hints about a new xbox console for a couple of years , @entity81 has been mum about any new hardware , focusing their efforts on the motion - based @entity115 controller			1
@entity118 games of course , all these new hardware devices wo n't mean a thing unless gamers have great games to play			0
there is a powerhouse line - up of major franchises and popular characters set to debut in 2012			2
" @entity8 " is sure to be the next blockbuster installment in an iconic franchise that has helped defined a generation of gaming			2
master chief returns to face an ancient evil that ( of course ) threatens the entire universe			2
speaking of saving the universe , " @entity135 " brings back commander @entity136 to resume his battles against the machine race of @entity139			0
the story is expected to flow directly from the ending of " @entity142 " and will also offer a female version of @entity136 for the first time			0
some old friends will be returning in " @entity146 " and " @entity147			0
" more than 10 years after " @entity149 , " players will get to battle the forces of evil with new destructible environments and classes to play			2
" @entity147 " returns from a 17 - year hiatus for more combat on wheels action and over-the - top explosions			2
" @entity158 : @entity165 " has been wowing audiences since its announcement in 2010 and has already won numerous awards even before its official release next year			0
taking the action from underwater to the skies , creator @entity166 is hoping fans will embrace the new direction and explore the new setting			0
" @entity179 " returns players to @entity174 in search of @entity176 , the hero from " @entity178			1
" the game was released in mid-december in @entity16 to perfect scores , selling more than 524,000 copies for the @entity25 version alone			1
@entity184 , developer of the game , is expecting a great launch for the rest of the world in 2012			1
other titles , like " @entity191 , " " @entity192 3 , " " @entity193 " and " @entity194 " will also be must - play games in the upcoming year			0
casual and mobile gaming but as is becoming increasingly clear , gaming is not just for consoles , and consoles are not just for gaming			0
smartphones and tablets are continuing their march into the gaming genre with more choices from @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 and other well - known gaming developers on the way			0
as mobile devices become more powerful , social and casual gaming is expected to define a new and growing base of folks as " gamers			0
" some research shows that demographic is morphing into nearly an even split between males and females , as well as getting older and more affluent			0
likewise , consoles are broadening their entertainment scope beyond just gaming , into live sporting events , movies and music			0
@entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229 have already made inroads that other providers are sure to be exploring in the coming year			0
look for that trend to continue as content producers look to capture audiences wherever they are			0
while 2011 was a big year in gaming , 2012 is projected to be even bigger			2
communications market researcher @entity236 expects the global gaming business to reach $ 40 billion in revenues by the end of 2012 , with high growth in the mobile game sector			2
there are likely to be twists and unexpected developments along the way for the gaming industry in 2012			2
and , in the end , the gaming consumer will be the one who decides which technology or title goes on to glory and which goes in the discount bin .			0

@entity9 will hit @entity13 , @entity14 shores in february after a @entity16 launch
later in 2012 , @entity41 will be releasing their next generation console called @entity10
" @entity179 " returns players to @entity174 in search of @entity176
