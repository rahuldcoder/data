-- a 44 - year - old male teacher from my hometown is set to be released after just 31 days of incarceration for raping a 14 - year - old girl who later killed herself			1
someone believed @entity7 of @entity8 , @entity9 , when she accused her 49 - year - old teacher , @entity10 , of forcible rape			1
he confessed , faced charges and then should have received a sentence commensurate with the crime of rape			1
but the legal process played out over three years , and just before her 17th birthday , @entity7 , shamed and shunned by classmates , shot herself			0
district judge @entity20 sentenced @entity10 to just 30 days			1
( the public outrage that followed caused @entity20 to attempt a review of his own sentencing , a move the @entity25 denied			1
) " he 'd suffered enough , " @entity20 said of @entity10 at the initial sentencing , and besides , @entity7 , " older than her chronological age , " was " as much in control of the situation " as her teacher , he said			1
" obviously a 14 - year - old ca n't consent , " the judge explained in the wake of public outrage , but this was n't " some violent , forcible , horrible rape			2
" it was n't , said the judge , " this forcible beat - up rape			2
" where does this bizarre line of reasoning come from ? we need only look around for clues at a media culture that regularly tells young girls that growing up means shedding all signs of pink princess innocence for a porn version of sexy			2
a culture that celebrates @entity56 singing , " i know you want it " at the @entity58 as @entity59 -- having made the lightening quick transformation from teen role model to sex object , whose job it is to give pleasure to a grown man -- twerks in his crotch			1
we reward girls and young women who take off their clothes , tell them that their sexual availability and sexual power are their most important assets			2
we grant them record deals , reality tv shows , and global news coverage			0
once they cross over , slut - shaming and @entity80 - like sentences enable men like @entity10 to take full advantage -- as long as it 's not " this forcible beat - up rape			1
" we rarely hear from young women themselves about what it 's like to traverse this cultural terrain			1
so i asked members of the @entity92 ( girl activists ages 13 - 22 from @entity94 ) to talk about what happened to @entity7			2
what does it feel like to be 14 and want to be wanted , to experience this new kind of power and illusion of control ? @entity102 , 18 , says she immediately identified with @entity7 , because " i was her			2
i remember being 14 and talking to 30 year - olds on the @entity104			0
i was feeling really alone and struggling to come to terms with who i was			0
i wanted to have some kind of social ( and sexual ) connection with people			0
that 's what led me to leer in chat rooms and talk to men who were more than twice my age			1
maybe they would love me and maybe i could feel less insecure			0
" @entity102 knows firsthand how easy it is " to get caught up in your undying feelings for someone , especially someone who is manipulating you into loving them			0
at 14 , you think that you know everything -- you think this person is n't doing anything wrong by having a relationship with you , and that no one understands			0
you think that you 're in love , when what you 're really in is abuse			0
" " when you 're 14 , " 15 - year - old @entity132 says			0
" it seems like the rest of the world is against you , especially if , as the judge described @entity138 , you 're ' a troubled kid			0
' i can get that , and i can see why @entity7 found refuge in a relationship with her teacher			0
when i was her age , there was this one teacher who everyone at my school adored			0
he saw potential in me that i was too insecure to see in myself			0
i looked like i could be in college			0
he treated me like i was grown up , so i thought i was more mature than i really was			0
but that 's the thing : looking older than you are in no way equals being emotionally mature			1
" @entity154 , 20 , implicates judge @entity20 's unquestioned participation " in a culture where representations of @entity158 prioritize sex appeal			1
@entity20 's claims speak volumes about the way women of color are hypersexualized			1
@entity7 was only 14 , but when @entity20 looked at her he saw someone older who was therefore experienced enough to understand , and even control , a sexual situation			1
she did not fit his image of ' youth ' and ' purity , ' so this 70 - year - old judge did not see a young girl who was victimized , but a sexually viable woman			1
" because the lines are blurred , we need judges who are educated and aware enough to see through the subterfuge of sexism and racism , who do the right thing -- whether in @entity182 , @entity8 , or my hometown			2
whatever else is going on in girls ' lives , whatever media messages we all receive about the commodification of their sexuality , we need to send a clear message that rape and sexual assault are crimes for a reason , that justice has nothing to do with how mature a girl looks or acts and everything to do with her suffering and her right to human dignity			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			2

@entity204 : @entity9 teen raped , teacher confessed , then judge gave one month sentence
@entity20 said girl looked older , was in control , teacher had " suffered "
@entity204 : @entity216 's distorted message about girls gives men like rapist -- and judge -- a pass
@entity204 : girls struggle to *navigate* this terrain ; judges must be wise enough to understand it
