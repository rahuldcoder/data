-- a federal appeals court ruled tuesday that the @entity2 must make a decision on whether to issue a permit for the long - term nuclear waste storage project at @entity7 's @entity6 , throwing into question plans to shutter the facility			1
the @entity10 , in a 2 - 1 decision , ordered the commission to decide whether to approve or reject the application for the storage project			1
" at this point , the @entity2 is simply defying a law enacted by @entity18 , and the @entity2 is doing so without any legal basis , " the order read			1
@entity6 -- 100 miles northwest of @entity20 -- was to be the solution to the @entity23 nuclear waste problem : a final destination for the tons of hazardous nuclear waste accumulating at commercial reactors in 33 states			2
in 1987 , @entity18 directed the @entity29 to dispose of waste in the mountain beginning in 1998			0
but political opposition to the plan has been relentless , and the @entity29 was unable to meet the deadline			0
in 2008 , the @entity29 submitted a license application to the @entity2 seeking to construct a nuclear waste repository at @entity6 , with a goal of opening it in 2017 , a date later delayed until 2020			1
in march of 2009 , following the election of president @entity41 , the secretary of energy announced plans to terminate the @entity6 project			1
the @entity2 has argued that the $ 11 million @entity18 appropriated for the permit application is insufficient and that @entity18 will not provide the additional funds necessary to complete the application			0
the @entity2 's @entity48 suspended the application until there was enough money to make progress			0
but in the court 's view , the appropriation bill is a mandate by @entity18 to proceed with the licensing process , regardless of the approval of additional funds that may be needed			0
" we would certainly hope that @entity18 would step in before the current $ 11.1 million is expended , so as to avoid wasting that taxpayer money			0
and @entity18 , of course , is under no obligation to appropriate additional money for the @entity6 project , " the court order read .			2

in a 2 - 1 decision , *judges* order @entity2 to approve or reject the permit for the storage project
there 's opposition to putting a long - term nuclear storage facility at @entity6
in 2009 , the @entity29 announced plans to terminate the project
the court says the @entity2 is defying the law by not making a decision
