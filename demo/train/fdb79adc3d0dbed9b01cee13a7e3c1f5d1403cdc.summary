@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 residents braced saturday for the arrival of a massive oil slick creeping toward shore as nearly a million feet of boom were deployed in an effort to protect precious estuaries and wildlife -- even as thousands of barrels of crude continued gushing into the water			1
landfall along the @entity16 and other @entity4 areas was expected as early as saturday			1
" i 'm pretty much on pause right now ... it 's just a big waiting game , " said @entity18 , a fisherman who leads boat trips for tourists out of @entity0 , @entity1			2
but even as officials and residents wait for the oil to reach land , the slick has already taken a dramatic toll on life all along the @entity30 , bringing fishing and tourism to a halt in many places and threatening to cripple those industries for weeks to come			1
" i 'm extremely worried because i have customers that [ have ] already canceled trips , " @entity18 told @entity2 saturday			1
" i should be out taking people fishing today and i 'm not			1
i 'm not making money today			2
i 'm worried about the now factor , you know ? " government leaders echoed those fears			0
" the oil that is leaking offshore , the oil that is coming onto our coast threatens more than just our wildlife , our fisheries , our coast , " @entity1 gov. @entity44 said at a saturday press conference			1
" this oil literally threatens our way of life			0
" the oil company @entity55 -- which operated the rig whose sinking caused the underwater oil gusher -- partnered with government officials to hold town hall meetings throughout the region saturday to respond to concern about the spill 's consequences			1
but frustration was growing saturday in @entity1 , @entity16 , @entity67 and @entity68			2
at a town hall meeting in @entity71 , @entity67 , mayor @entity69 warned fishermen in the audience that outbursts would be met with arrest			0
the fishermen were told that they were not allowed to ask questions			0
@entity44 suggested the response to the oil slick has so far been inadequate , saying " we continue to be concerned with @entity55 's ability to respond to this incident			1
" @entity44 said he has been working with local officials to develop cleanup contingency plans , but needs funding approval from @entity55 and authorization from the @entity88 's incident commander to move forward			1
" we need to empower our locals on the ground , " he said			0
" now they 're saying we are seeing sheens , " hitting the coast , @entity44 said saturday , citing the @entity91			2
" but they expect the heavier oil to be coming by tomorrow and monday			0
" @entity98 @entity88 commandant admiral @entity97 -- who the @entity100 administration designated saturday to lead response to the oil slick -- said that oil is likely to reach shorelines in @entity1 , @entity16 and @entity67			1
" the real question is when , " he said			0
@entity97 said saturday that the government and @entity55 's top priority is trying to stop the oil leak , but offered no timetable for when that goal might be achieved			1
" we do n't know how many days the discharge will continue to occur , " he said			0
such reports darkened forecasts about the spill 's environmental impact			1
" this has the potential of being truly devastating , " @entity117 , of the @entity118 , told @entity2			0
environmentalist @entity120 of the @entity122 organization said the magnitude of the oil leak could cause damage that would last decades			0
" this event is a self - feeding fire , " @entity120 told @entity2			0
" it is so big and expanding so fast that it 's pretty much beyond human response that can be effective			0
... you 're looking at a long - term poisoning of the area			2
ultimately , this will have a multi-decade impact			1
" president @entity100 announced he will visit the oil spill area sunday morning			1
the oil spill started april 20 , after an explosion on the @entity55 - operated @entity141 drilling platform in the @entity4			1
eleven oil rig workers remain missing and are presumed dead			0
the rig sank april 22 about 50 miles ( 80 km ) off the southeast coast of @entity1 , and the untapped wellhead is gushing about 5,000 barrels of oil a day into the @entity4 , according to @entity55 and government estimates			1
some environmentalists say the amount could be much larger			0
about 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion , the @entity88 said			0
@entity55 said two @entity1 communities -- @entity0 and @entity153 -- will be the first places likely hit by the oil slick			1
nearly 2,000 personnel have joined the response effort , which includes 68 vessels , among them skimmers , tugs , barges and oil - recovery ships , officials said			0
crews worked through friday night to dispense 3,000 gallons of sub-surface dispersant , officials said			0
the @entity88 's @entity97 said that an initial test of dispersant released near the wellhead suggested the method could " significantly mitigate the amount [ of oil ] that makes it to the surface			0
" such tests have never been done before , @entity55 spokeswoman @entity175 said			1
she said that the dispersants attach themselves to underwater concentrations of oil , causing the oil to sink to the bottom and dissipate			0
while the dispersants can help dissipate oil slicks and help birds and other land - based or water - surface wildlife , the chemicals can hurt fish and other underwater species , environmentalist @entity180 said			2
" the scale of the event and the likely duration of the event ... really leaves responders with no good options , " @entity120 said			0
" while [ dispersants ] can protect terrestial wildlife ... out in the ocean they make toxic biocomponents available to the marine food chain			2
" rapid response teams are staged to deploy to shorelines affected by the oil , federal officials said saturday			2
the teams will evaluate and determine an appropriate clean - up effort to minimize impact on the environment			2
in addition , secretary of defense @entity210 has approved @entity44 's request to mobilize 6,000 @entity214 troops			0
meanwhile , the @entity216 has been in contact with all oil and gas operators in the oil spill area , officials said			1
two platforms have stopped production and one has been evacuated as a safety measure , federal officials said in a release saturday morning			2
federal officials have urged @entity55 to beef up its response			1
" we 'll continue to urge @entity55 to leverage additional assets , " secretary of homeland security @entity226 said friday as she toured the area			1
" it is time for @entity55 to supplement their current mobilization as the slick of oil moves toward shore			1
" @entity236 , chief operating officer of @entity55 , said the company has had three priorities : stop the flow of oil , minimize its impact and keep the public informed			1
" we 've so far mounted the largest response effort ever done in the world , " @entity236 said			0
" we 've utilized every technology available , we 've applied every resource request			2
... we welcome every new idea and every offer of support			0
" @entity55 said it has been trying to stop the flow by using remote - controlled submarines to activate a valve atop the well			1
but the valve is not working , the energy company said			0
as concerns about the spill 's toll mount -- particularly in the commercial fishing industry , a critical $ 2.4 billion economic engine for the region -- @entity100 promised steps to prevent a similar disaster in the future			1
the president asked interior secretary @entity265 " to conduct a thorough review of this incident and report back to me in 30 days on what , if any , additional precautions and technologies should be required to prevent accidents like this from happening again			2
" federal officials , including the president , emphasized that @entity55 is legally responsible for paying the costs of the response to and cleanup of the spill			1
the cause of the blast on the @entity141 remains unknown			0
seventeen of the 126 people on the rig were injured in the blast , three of them critically			0
one person remained hospitalized saturday , federal officials said			2
@entity2 's @entity288 and @entity289 contributed to this report .			0
