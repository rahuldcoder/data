@entity0 , @entity1 -- the troubled @entity4 era ends in @entity1 on thursday as another firm takes over the once - dominant company 's security services contract in @entity0			1
a helicopter for the private security firm then known as @entity4 flies over @entity0 in october 2003			2
@entity10 , a @entity11 , @entity12 - based company , picks up the expiring contract of the security firm formerly known as @entity4 , which changed its name to xe a few months ago			2
the @entity16 decided not to renew @entity4 's contract in january			2
" when the @entity22 government initially asked for our help to assist with an immediate need to protect @entity22 in @entity1 , we answered that call and performed well , " xe spokeswoman @entity18 said in a statement wednesday			1
" but we always knew that , at some point , that work would come to a close			0
" the end of the contract followed the @entity1 government 's refusal to renew the firm 's operating license because of a september 2007 shooting in which @entity0 says security guards -- then employed by @entity4 -- killed 17 @entity1 civilians			1
as part of a contract to protect @entity22 diplomats and other employees around the world , the @entity16 hired @entity4 for a multiyear assignment in @entity1 , renewable annually			1
@entity4 , one of three security firms working for the @entity22 in @entity1 , had one of the biggest contracts there , providing security for the sprawling @entity22 @entity50 in @entity0			1
" we are honored to have provided this service for five years and are proud of our success			0
no one under our protection has been killed or even seriously injured , " @entity53 said			0
many xe employees are expected to go to work for @entity10 , which already had a @entity16 contract in @entity1			2
its new contract increases its share of the security work			0
@entity63 also has a @entity16 contract for work in @entity1			0
losing the contract is considered a huge blow to @entity4			0
while the company is privately held , the @entity1 contract has been estimated to make up a third to a half of its business			2
@entity4 has about two dozen aircraft in @entity1 as well as 1,000 personnel			0
@entity4 's statement acknowledged that the company 's @entity0 " task order " ends thursday but was mum on any other roles it still might have in @entity1			1
" any specific questions on the contract and how it will now be fulfilled should be directed to the @entity16 , " @entity53 said			0
despite the loss of the embassy security detail , @entity4 continues to hold other contracts with the @entity16 to protect @entity22 diplomats elsewhere in the world			0
the company 's founder , @entity90 , resigned as head of the business in march			2
in january , five former @entity4 security guards pleaded not guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and other serious crimes stemming from their involvement in the september 16 , 2007 , incident in a @entity0 square			1
a sixth former security guard has pleaded guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter			0
@entity4 said its employees were returning fire after armed insurgents attacked them , but an @entity1 investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation			1
the @entity1 government said 17 civilians were killed , although the indictment alleges 14 died			1
the company does not face any charges			0
but the @entity0 incident exacerbated the feelings of many @entity1 that private @entity22 security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for @entity1 law or life			1
the indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of @entity127 contractors under the @entity128			0
the act was amended in 2004 to allow the @entity130 to prosecute such personnel providing services " in support of the mission of the @entity135 overseas			0
" last year , the @entity16 renewed @entity4 's contract over strong objections from the @entity1 government			1
starting january 1 , the @entity1 government has mandated that all contractors obtain @entity1 licenses to operate .			1

the firm 's contract was not renewed after a 2007 shooting in @entity0
