-- @entity2 's prime minister said saturday that @entity4 officials appreciate his country 's " transparency and candor " in the handling of the search for missing @entity10			1
" i think it 's to our country 's credit that we 've approached it that way , " @entity11 told journalists in @entity4			1
he reiterated the " high degree of confidence " he has expressed before that acoustic signals picked up by searchers in the @entity20 are from the plane 's black box			1
but he warned that , that even if the plane is lying on the bottom of the sea underneath the search vessels that locating it underneath nearly three miles of water would be a " massive , massive task			1
" " it is likely to continue for a long time to come , " he said			0
@entity34 commander ' optimistic ' the @entity34 commander leading the @entity37 effort to find @entity10 said he 's " optimistic " about how the search is proceeding			1
" we are detecting very continuous pings coming through in a manner consistent with exactly what you 'd expect from a black box , " cmdr			1
@entity46 told @entity0 's @entity47 on friday			2
" we 've ruled out that it was anything natural , or anything from commercial shipping , or anything like that			0
" @entity2 prime minister @entity11 said earlier friday that search efforts are heading in the right direction			1
@entity46 said , " i agree with the prime minister			0
" up to nine military aircraft , one civil aircraft and 14 ships will assist in saturday 's search for the airliner , @entity2 's @entity57 said in a press release			1
the center of the 41,393 - square - kilometer ( 16,000 square - mile ) search area lies about 2,331 kilometers ( 1,448 miles ) northwest of @entity66			1
@entity11 's confidence @entity11 has expressed such confidence about detected acoustic signals coming from the plane 's black box before			1
over the past week , four such pings have been detected by a ping locator towed by the @entity2 vessel @entity74			1
" we are confident that we know the position of the black box flight recorder to within some kilometers , but confidence in the approximate position of the black box is not the same as recovering wreckage from almost 4Â½ kilometers beneath the sea or finally determining all that happened on that flight , " he said			1
a fifth ping , detected thursday by a sonobuoy dropped by an airplane , is " unlikely to be related to the aircraft black boxes , " @entity2 chief search coordinator @entity87 said friday			1
" on the information i have available to me , there has been no major breakthrough in the search for @entity10 , " @entity87 said in a statement friday			2
" further analysis continues to be undertaken by @entity98			0
" friday was day 35 in the search , and the batteries powering the flight data recorders ' locator beacons are certified to emit signals for only 30 days after they get wet			1
that has injected the search effort with a heightened sense of urgency			2
the signal is " starting to fade , and we are hoping to get as much information as we can before the signal finally expires , " @entity11 said			1
families skeptical families of the 239 people who were aboard when the plane disappeared from radar screens early march 8 met friday with @entity117 and government officials			0
they came away unpersuaded that progress was being made			0
" today , all they said was that they were confident , " family representative @entity120 said			0
" but that really does n't mean that they have confirmed it			0
they did n't use the word ' confirm			0
' so it could be that it 's a real lead , but it could also not be			2
i think that , at the moment , everyone needs to wait for final , confirmed information			0
" that view was echoed by @entity138 , whose partner , @entity139 , was among the passengers			0
" every time some official gives one of those absolute statements of ' we 're sure it 's the pings from the black boxes ' or ' we 're sure it 's in the ocean , ' we all crash , " she told @entity0 's " @entity152			1
" " our feet get knocked out from underneath us			0
but then it always ends up reversing itself , and they step back from it			0
" she expressed skepticism about the way the investigation has been handled			0
" the fox is very much in charge of the henhouse here , " she told " @entity152			0
" " we 've got a country leading the investigation who also has the primary liability in the case , and it makes us question every step that 's taken			2
" new flight details revealed @entity173 sources told @entity0 that flight 370 's pilot , capt. @entity174 , was the last person on the jet to speak to air traffic controllers , telling them " good night , @entity173 three - seven - zero			2
" the sources said there was nothing unusual about his voice , which conveyed no indication that he was under stress			0
one of the sources , an official involved in the investigation , told @entity0 that police played the recording to five other @entity117 pilots who knew the pilot and co-pilot			0
" there were no third - party voices , " the source said			0
imagining the search underwater search area shrinks up to 12 military aircraft , three civil aircraft and 13 ships were assigned to assist in friday 's search for the @entity200 , which was carrying 239 people when it vanished on march 8 on a fight from @entity203 , @entity173 , to @entity204			1
there were no sightings reported by search aircraft or objects recovered by ships thursday , the @entity57 said			2
friday 's search area was about 18,000 square miles ( 46,600 square kilometers ) , centered 1,436 miles ( 2,311 kilometers ) northwest of @entity66			1
that 's far smaller than the search area 's size a few weeks ago			1
" it 's pretty incredible if you look at where we started , which was virtually the entire @entity20			2
now getting it down to what 's essentially a couple hundred square miles ( where the pings have been detected ) is pretty miraculous , " @entity46 said			1
the @entity74 first picked up two sets of underwater pulses april 5 that were of a frequency close to that used by the locator beacons			0
it heard nothing more until tuesday , when it reacquired the signals twice			2
the four signals were within 17 miles of one another			2
as the search continues , a @entity34 ship will help provide supplies and fuel to the ships that are looking for the missing plane			1
the @entity239 will help supply @entity2 naval ships involved in the search " in the coming days , " the @entity34 said in a statement			1
that 's probably a sign that search teams are preparing for a lengthy hunt , analysts said			2
tracking pings is only one early step in the hunt to find the plane 's data records , wreckage and the people aboard			0
" i think they 're getting ready for the long haul , " said @entity256 , the aviation analyst			0
" even if they do get four or five more pings , once they drop the side - scanning sonar device down , that is going to be painstaking and long			0
so i think they are settling in for the long search			0
" as the focus narrows , more questions emerge in search for @entity173 370 the hunt for a flight 370 ping : how they are doing it how deep is deep ? imagining the @entity10 search underwater @entity0 's @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 and @entity281 and journalists @entity282 and @entity284 contributed to this report .			2

new : transparent *communication* is ' to our country 's credit , ' @entity2 leader says
@entity11 : ' high degree of confidence ' that the detected signals are from the black box
" we 're optimistic , " @entity34 commander says
saturday 's search area is 41,393 square kilometers ( 16,000 square miles )
