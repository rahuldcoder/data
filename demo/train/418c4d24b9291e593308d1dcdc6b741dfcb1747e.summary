editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			1
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			1
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity5 ) -- on the morning of may 24 of this year , two gunmen ambushed and murdered @entity20 activist @entity19 and his wife , @entity21 do @entity22 in the @entity24 state of @entity25			1
the couple 's involvement in environmentalism began with the creation of the @entity31 settlement in 1997			1
this settlement , where fruit gathering is the only form of production permitted , is part of a program of agrarian reform designated for poor families who depend on the land for survival			1
elected out of the almost 200 poor families who live in the area , they led the fight to protect the forest			2
they became activists through practice , defending their property from illegal loggers the same way your dad would against drivers who clip his lawn -- by going out on the curb and yelling at them			1
" the problems we have arrived with the creation of the settlement project			2
i did n't belong to any social movement			2
i lived in my own little corner , " @entity64 explained			2
" @entity66 , a neighbor of mine , invited me to participate in the meetings , and i found out i was already an environmentalist without even knowing it			2
" outside @entity24 , the fight for the @entity20 is seen largely as an ecological matter , but here it 's a social issue			1
this is a country where 1 percent of the population owns more than half the land , a sickening proportion of it composed of large , completely unused tracts of farmland called latifundios			2
the former rain forest around @entity81 and @entity21 's settlement is a prime example of such irresponsible land use			2
the majority of deforested land in the @entity20 is used for cattle ranching			1
as ranchers and their supporters will point out , the beef industry is a major part of @entity24 's economy and an increasingly important source of @entity95 meat			0
the problem is that while clear - cutting sections of rain forest and burning out all the underbrush makes great soil for pastureland , it only does so for about three years			1
after that , the soil 's fertility plunges , " invasive " jungle plants like the babaçu tree begin to grow again , and ranchers are forced to find another plot of rain forest to slash and burn for their cows			0
see the rest of @entity112 : @entity20 at @entity5 throughout the years , six farmers who owned illegal titles were forced out by @entity81 and @entity21 's settlement			1
during this same time , the federal government , via the @entity117 , had promised to provide some form of basic infrastructure , but public support never materialized			0
with no alternatives , more and more of the settlers began to give up , and @entity81 and @entity21 became increasingly isolated			0
the morning of their deaths , @entity81 and @entity21 had been driving to @entity124 , the biggest and most important city in @entity25 's interior			0
once well within the rain forest , the city as well as its surrounding area now looks like @entity130 and is the capital of the state 's cattle industry			0
it is also one of the most violent places in the world			0
locals like to call it @entity140 , which translates roughly to mara - bullets			1
the murder rate is a horrifying 125 per 100,000 people , second only to nearby @entity145 , with 160.6			0
by point of comparison , the rate in @entity8 is 5			0
the grisly death of @entity81 and @entity21 -- shot point - blank with a hunting rifle , and @entity81 's ear cut off to prove the hit took place -- harkened back to other violent moments in the history of the @entity20 , such as the assassinations of father @entity157 in 1986 , @entity158 in 1988 and sister @entity159 in 2005			1
in the past 15 years , 212 community leaders have been murdered just in the state of @entity25			0
" i do n't blame the farmer			0
he does n't know better			0
the businessman is to blame			0
the richer he is , the more destructive power he possesses , " @entity21 said before her death			1
" the majority of farmers are just dupes of the rich			0

*married* environmental activists shot to death outside their home in @entity20 in may
@entity5 *interviewed* the *husband* in 2010 ; he was already receiving death threats
@entity5 goes to their *hometown* to look at the town locals call @entity184 , or ' mara - bullets '
