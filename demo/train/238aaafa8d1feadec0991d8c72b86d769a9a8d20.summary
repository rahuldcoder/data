@entity0 , @entity1 -- fighting continued monday as rival @entity1 militias battled for @entity4 and the interim government said it was considering asking for international military help			1
in a statement aired on a private @entity1 television channel , one of the three main @entity11 groups in @entity0 said that at least two members of the force defending positions at the airport were killed in a rocket attack			1

the government in a written statement said early tuesday that it discussed at an emergency session " a potential request for international forces to solidify the state 's capabilities " at an emergency session			1
while @entity1 officials have called for calm , the government is weak and militias outnumber and outgun its security forces			1
many of the armed groups are on the state 's payroll			0
these circumstances make it very difficult for the government to gain control over this latest increasingly volatile and violent situation			2
still the government on tuesday called for an immediate halt to the fighting and for the militias to withdraw within a week at least 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) from the airport			1
it said any commander that orders attacks on civilian facilities , including the airport , will face charges of murder			1

a @entity2 crew could hear sporadic gunfire and explosions in the direction of the airport			0
the government said the customs building , maintenance building and some national security department planes had been destroyed			0

the @entity96 announced that it had evacuated its staff			1
" this is a temporary measure , " the @entity96 said in a written statement			2
" @entity100 will return as soon as security conditions permit			0

tensions remain even though @entity1 successfully toppled the 42 - year rule of @entity140 in 2011 , the country is far from stable			2
armed militias are now the biggest challenge			0
the international community has largely agreed that the key to resolving @entity1 's crisis is national dialogue			1
but a weak central government -- combined with militias split along regional , tribal and ideological lines -- has added to the challenge			0
the @entity150 said this past weekend it was concerned the fighting could lead to widespread conflict and backed the new government			0
" we affirm our support for @entity1 's democratic transition and urge the seating of the new @entity159 as soon as possible , " the statement added			2
