-- you 've probably heard that the @entity4 government 's attempt to ban @entity5 quickly collapsed into farce			1
from @entity7 : " more than 2.5 million tweets -- or over 17,000 per minute -- were reportedly posted ( from @entity4 ) in the first 24 hours after the ban , according to several media reports			2
@entity13 , a @entity14 , @entity15 - based startup that measures and analyzes @entity5 marketing campaigns , said in a corporate blog post that its traffic from @entity4 tripled in the first day after the ban			1
so ... all is good , right ? not right			0
@entity4 is a @entity19 ally , a candidate for membership in the @entity22 , a front - line state facing @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 -- and it is heading seriously in the wrong direction			0
a lot of people have invested a lot of time and effort denying that unwelcome news			0
it can be denied no longer			0
@entity4 's @entity5 - banning prime minister , @entity35 , came to power after a big election win in 2002			1
@entity35 's party was staunchly @entity39 , yet seemingly committed to electoral democracy			1
its victory was hailed by many as a hopeful sign for the post- 9/11 world			0
@entity45 had @entity47 parties ; why could n't @entity4 have a @entity48 ? indeed , @entity35 - style @entity49 seemed a decade ago the striking alternative to radical @entity51 , a political alternative that would integrate religion into politics while preserving individual freedom and democratic decision - making			1
@entity35 and his @entity39 regime lifted restrictions on the wearing of hijab in public buildings			1
he abolished the daily pledge of allegiance to a secular @entity4 required in all @entity4 schools since 1933			0
he downgraded the longstanding @entity4 relationship with @entity64 and mused instead about a " neo-ottoman " role for @entity4 at the head of the @entity68 's @entity48 nations			1
he and his party passed restrictions on the sale and promotion of alcohol and boldly disavowed the equality of the sexes			0
at the same time , the @entity35 government did initiate important economic liberation of @entity4 's traditionally state - led economy			1
he made concessions to ethnic and religious minorities			0
it seemed imaginable that @entity35 's reactionary religious message could somehow be fused with modern economics and tolerance			1
president @entity86 certainly imagined so : in a 2012 interview with @entity0 's @entity88 , the president cited prime minister @entity35 as one of the five foreign leaders with whom he 'd forged his closest " bonds of trust "			1
yet from the start , @entity35 's @entity39 democracy had a strongly authoritarian whiff to it			1
through the @entity35 years , @entity4 has led the world in the number of journalists jailed , ahead of both @entity100 and @entity24			1
@entity35 's government banned @entity102 for two years beginning in 2007 , purged and jailed hundreds of politically uncongenial military officers and reshaped both police and the judiciary			1
@entity4 voters overlooked and forgave these infringements			2
they elected and twice re-elected @entity35			0
@entity4 achieved genuine economic progress during his rule			0
ordinary @entity4 believed that their blunt , traditionalist prime minister cherished their interests in a way his more cosmopolitan predecessors did not			1
then came the swirl of corruption rumors , corruption on a massive multi-billion dollar scale			0
police fired tear gas and water cannon at people protesting the death of a 15 - year - old boy who died in demonstrations against development of @entity126 in central @entity127			0
@entity128 was posted to social media that purported to reveal the prime minister in plots with his son to collect and conceal tens of millions of @entity133 in illegal cash			1
( @entity35 has claimed that a corruption investigation that entangled four of his former cabinet ministers is a " coup plot " and that some of the recordings are " immorally edited material "			2
) @entity35 has responded with more censorship and more controls , culminating in the @entity5 ban			2
that ban failed -- yet the underlying problem remains : the country that was once the @entity147 's most reliable partner in the @entity39 world is not so reliable any more			2
@entity4 defies embargoes to trade with @entity24			0
@entity4 foreign policy has sought to build relationships with everyone and anyone except @entity4 's traditional @entity147 partners : with @entity25 , @entity100 , @entity26 , anyone			2
with @entity26 's seizure of @entity158 , the once - exotic and once - remote @entity156 has suddenly emerged as a central global zone of conflict			0
@entity161 was when the @entity162 and the western world could count on a steady , responsible and democratizing ally on the south shore of that sea			2
the @entity5 ban has collapsed			0
all the bad impulses that imposed that @entity5 ban remain in place -- and will remain so long as @entity35 remains in office			2
the promise of an @entity39 version of @entity47 has proved a big lie			0
instead , the country that was once the most stable , reliable and democratic state in the @entity39 world seems now to have cast itself as the region 's saddest backward - slider -- with its ever more authoritarian leader playing the role of an @entity39 @entity182 , or maybe @entity183			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			0

@entity186 : @entity4 once gave people hope for the *future* of democracy in @entity39 nations
he says voters have repeatedly backed prime minister @entity35 's path for @entity4
after corruption *scandal* and *criticism* , @entity35 sought to shut off @entity5
@entity200 : @entity162 , allies can no longer count on @entity4 as a stable force in a crucial region
