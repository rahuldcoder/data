-- @entity1 : bitter , party of one			1
what else can you say about an accomplished but jaded black scholar who continues to behave like a @entity9 troll when it comes to president @entity11 ? why does he unfairly criticize @entity11 ? could it be because of a bruised ego ? it may have started back in february 2008			1
@entity1 , an author , media personality and leading voice in the black community , invited then - sen. @entity11 to speak at his " @entity21 " forum in @entity20			1
@entity11 declined , opting instead to campaign because he was locked in a tough primary with sen. @entity23 , who did attend the forum			1
in his place , @entity11 offered to send his wife , @entity26			2
anyone who has seen the first lady speak knows this is hardly a consolation prize			0
@entity11 sent a letter , reiterating the importance of the forum , and asked @entity1 to reconsider			1
and thus , the rift			0
in 2011 , @entity1 was on @entity35 claiming that @entity11 was " the first president in my professional career that has n't invited me to the @entity38			1
" though truth be told , i 'm not prone to inviting people who diss my better half over to the house either			0
not that i 'm suggesting @entity1 should n't be able to interview or criticize the president			1
in fact , i have challenged some of president @entity11 's policies and decisions for years in my columns , on tv and over radio			1
but i 've always tried to do so in context			0
so , for those of you enamored with @entity1 's recent criticism of the president 's remarks about race , which he described as " weak as pre-sweetened @entity61 , " remember it 's all about context			1
in this case , the context includes their bumpy history			0
same goes for @entity1 's partner - in - whine , @entity67 , who was so upset that he received one ticket to the 2009 inauguration instead of the requested three that afterward he compared @entity11 to @entity71			1
before ticket-gate , @entity67 went on the trail for @entity11			2
after the incident , @entity67 went off on @entity11			2
last year , @entity67 called the @entity76 president a " @entity79 in blackface " while supposedly on an awareness tour with @entity1 to talk about poverty			1
the idea behind the initiative was a noble one			0
unfortunately , when they were n't talking about the poor , they would throw random haymakers at the president , like @entity67 's " blackface " remark			0
as a result , media coverage spent more time focused on the jabs than on ways to lift the poor out of poverty			0
this week , @entity67 called @entity11 a " global @entity100 " in an interview with @entity99			2
also while a guest on @entity1 's radio show , the @entity102 professor said that @entity108 host and @entity11 supporter , the rev. @entity110 , " probably deep down wants to be critical of the president , but he ca n't because he 's still on the @entity11 plantation			1
" @entity67 also insinuated that other blacks who are n't as critical of the president as he and @entity1 are also residents of this so - called plantation			1
perhaps we should make that : bitter , party of two			0
in fairness , it is hard to prove that the vitriol the pair spews in @entity11 's way all stems from perceived snubs from a few years ago			2
but the timing of it all is curious			0
and the personal attacks -- @entity67 once said @entity11 was afraid of " free black men " -- make it difficult to believe yesteryear 's leftovers are not still on today 's menu			1
now , i do believe poverty is the least talked about major issue we have in this country			0
and it seemed like the entire 2012 general election was focused on the rich and declining middle class , with little to no talk about where the middle class was declining to			0
@entity67 and @entity1 's criticism of @entity11 for this omission is reasonable , especially since silence on this issue has a big impact on the black community			1
a recent study released by @entity149 shows how difficult it is for people born in the lower 5 % to reach the top 5 %			0
in some parts of the country , the chances of moving up the income ladder are as high as 35 %			0
but in regions with a large black population , such as near @entity158 , @entity159 ; @entity161 , @entity162 , and @entity163 , it is as low as 4 %			0
to be born in poverty and then die in poverty is an @entity167 nightmare			0
so i applaud @entity67 and @entity1 for using their platform to draw attention to the often overlooked problem			2
but if they 're motivated by personal grievances , shame on them for displaying their pettiness while touting important policy critiques			1
first of all , it 's self - serving			0
second , it 's obvious			0
earlier this year @entity181 , who once featured @entity1 on his syndicated radio show but parted ways with him after his unjust attacks on @entity11 in 2008 , said , " @entity1 is fascinated with his own legacy , and that 's not good			1
he wants more than anything to be remembered the way dr. @entity190 was , and to somehow make that kind of mark on the world			0
" translation : it 's all about @entity1			2
when @entity11 did n't accept the invitation to speak at @entity1 's forum in 2008 , @entity1 interpreted it as an affront to his influence in the black community			1
when @entity11 opted not to attend in 2009 -- although he did address the crowd via video conference -- that was the proverbial final straw			2
@entity1 and @entity204 have been aggressively attacking the president , sandwiching legitimate concerns about poverty in between over-the - top comments that far too often detract from what they claim is their primary focus -- helping poor black people			1
their comments may grab headlines and land them on sunday morning talk shows , but how have they engaged with the administration in finding solutions on poverty ? instead , @entity1 and @entity204 appear to be two egocentric men who believe they alone are the face of black intellectualism			1
and any black talking heads who do n't side with them have , in @entity67 's words , " sold their souls			0
" welcome to the ivory tower version of black on black crime			0
again , i 'm all for fairly criticizing the man in the @entity38			0
but it feels that @entity67 and @entity1 are more upset that @entity11 did n't kiss their rings before he walked through the door than about anything he 's done since he got inside			1
( note : an earlier version of this article said @entity1 was fired by @entity239 ; @entity1 announced that he had resigned although @entity239 's staff said the radio host elected not to renew his contract			2
) the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity245 .			2

@entity245 : why do @entity1 and @entity247 unfairly criticize president @entity11 ?
@entity245 : could it be because they feel personal grievances toward @entity11 ?
he says the two are right to criticize @entity11 on policy issues but name - calling is petty
@entity245 : @entity1 , @entity204 seem egocentric in believing they are face of black intellectualism
