today , as we celebrate the legacy of dr. @entity3 , i know there are those who will ask , " how long will it take ? " how long until the dream is fulfilled ? how long until our destination is reached ? but , like dr. @entity3 , we must continue to march on			2
we march on toward the realization of the @entity12			2
we are not diverted by those who would deny opportunity based on what we look like or where we came from or who would deny equality based on who we love			2
we march on poverty , until every child has the nourishment of body and mind needed to fuel their chance at success			2
we must find ways to bring those from the " outskirts of hope " closer to the circle of opportunity			2
we march on ballot boxes , because the rights for which we fought are too important to give up now			1
and no one should silence us simply because they might disagree with our views			2
we march on because all lives matter , not to be judged by the color of their skin			0
how long ? not long , because the images and words and fights of half a century ago still have the power to rouse us to march			1
how long ? i do n't really know			0
but as dr. @entity3 once told us , " the arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends toward justice			0
" this year , i know i am not the only one with the @entity52 - nominated " @entity51 " on my mind			1
across the country , people are lining up in theaters and watching a raw image of the sacrifice 600 voting rights marchers made : as they pursued the right to vote , they were brutally attacked by police using billy clubs and tear gas			1
the lessons of the struggle depicted in this movie are important , important enough to be mindful of them every day			0
but we should be especially mindful as we celebrate @entity69			0
today is a day of national reflection , but it is also a day of action			0
remembering those who sacrificed before us is important , but carrying on their legacy and continuing to march forward is essential			0
the walk from @entity51 to @entity77 that turned into @entity51 leaves us with a strong reminder of how much those before us gave for basic human rights			1
the walk is a strong reminder of how @entity81 stood side - by - side with dr. @entity3 , so that today he can stand in the chambers of @entity84 and continue to use his voice to fight , as he did 50 years ago , for the right to vote			1
because even though 50 years have passed since the marches of 1965 that led to the passage of the @entity89 , we are still in that fight today			1
just last week , @entity92 chair @entity91 said that it 's not " necessary " to fix the mangled @entity89 after the @entity95 's decision left the door open to burdensome and unfair voting restrictions			1
all i can say is he either does not read the news or he does n't think protecting all eligible @entity101 ' right to vote is important			0
in the last election cycle , we saw the country take significant steps backward as more states restricted the right to vote			0
in @entity108 and @entity109 , @entity107 passed measures limiting the times polls are open and cutting weekend voting typically favored by black and low - income voters			1
in @entity114 , republicans passed what have been called the " nation 's most restrictive voting laws , " establishing rules that make it more difficult for people to register to , and actually , vote			1
in @entity123 , students were banned from using student ids as a valid form of identification , while recently married or divorced women were stopped from voting if their names did not match their ids			1
and it 's important to remember that all of these new voting restrictions are aimed at addressing a problem that does not exist			1
reported cases of voter fraud are incredibly rare , so it 's puzzling why the @entity107 is so insistent on pushing these laws			1
one thing we do know is that these laws disproportionately affect women , young people , the elderly , @entity141 and @entity142 voters -- voters who traditionally vote for @entity143			0
those negatively affected by these unnecessary , indeed oppressive , voting restrictions constitute over half of the voting population			1
the 2014 midterm elections left us with even more conservative state houses and more conservative governors , so it 's never been more important that we remain vigilant in fighting back against these discriminatory measures			0
when more voices are heard , our country is better for it			0
when more voices are heard , the leaders better represent the views of those they represent			0
our country has seen unrest this year , and as our civil rights leaders taught us , a vote is the clearest way to make our voices heard , to stand up for our convictions			2
we have such a pressing moral obligation to live up to the name of this day			0
for dr. @entity3 who gave his life , along with many others including @entity171 , @entity172 and the rev. @entity173 , for the 600 individuals who made unbelievable sacrifices that day in @entity51 , for our children who should not have to face the same hardship the men and women before us had to face			1
let 's honor this day and those who fought for freedom before us , and let 's keep fighting for the things we still believe make us the country we are today			0
let us continue to march on .			0
