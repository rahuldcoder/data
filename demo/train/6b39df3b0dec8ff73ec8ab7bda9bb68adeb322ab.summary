-- at @entity2 , @entity1 unveiled the next generation of @entity4 , its mobile operating system			1
@entity4 6 sports more than 200 new features and upgrades — including the new @entity9 , deep @entity11 integration and improvements to @entity13			1
although @entity15 wo n't be available on compatible devices until sometime this fall , the first beta build is currently available to developers			1
we 've installed @entity15 on our new @entity21 ( 64gb @entity20 model ) and poked around with the new features			1
while it is clear that this is a beta — certain features are n't fully baked , and there is some crashing and inconsistency with a few existing apps — it 's equally clear that this is a solid @entity15 update			1
@entity0 : @entity4 6 : everything you need to know because we 've tested @entity15 6 on an @entity21 and not an @entity33 , we ca n't explore all of the new @entity15 features			1
but this release , more than any other , is intended to unify @entity15 across platforms			1
maps @entity1 's decision to eschew @entity39 in @entity15 is a big deal			1
mapping and location are an integral part of the modern smartphone experience			0
@entity39 and @entity45 own their own mapping technologies , and it makes sense that @entity1 would want to make good on some of its mapping investments			1
these include @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			0
the 3d models from @entity52 are immediately evident in @entity1 's new mapping app — at least , in the areas that have already been rendered			1
in our tests , certain areas — including @entity57 and the @entity58 at 1 @entity59 — had beautiful 3d terrain overlays			0
in @entity64 , however , those images looked pretty bad			0
but again , this is a beta			0
the street mapping aspect of the new @entity68 app pulls in data from @entity70 and from what we can tell , @entity73			0
@entity75 technology helps power the @entity77			0
while we have n't had a chance to go hands - on in a car with @entity77 , in our walking tests , it worked as you would expect			2
what did n't work as we expected was transit directions , and this could be a real wrinkle for @entity1			1
in monday 's @entity90 , @entity1 's @entity89 said that the company would highlight transit apps from the @entity93 in its mapping product			1
at the time , i took this to mean that it would highlight other location apps			0
what i did n't realize is that @entity1 is actually going to rely on these apps to power the transit directions within @entity4			1
now , we do n't know what the final version of this product will look like — but if this means users will need to download a local area transit map or schedule tool in order to get transit directions in @entity15 , that 's going to be a problem for many thousands of users that rely on their iphones for public transit directions on a daily basis			1
i like third - party transit apps as much as the next person			0
but i also really , really like having a schedule built into my main mapping client , so i can quickly get directions in an area where i do n't know the bus or train route layout			2
that quibble aside , our first experience with @entity1 's new @entity9 app is positive			1
in fact , with the exception of @entity77 nav , it does n't feel that much different than the @entity39 app. that 's a good thing			1
facebook integration we 've already detailed a bit about how @entity11 's integration with @entity15 works			1
at this very early stage , the @entity11 / @entity4 6 integration works in a way that 's nearly identical to @entity140 's current integration with @entity141			1
that is to say , it 's part of the system — if you want it to be — and third - party apps can plug into the architecture for even better use			1
for sharing photos and websites , the ability to share directly to @entity11 is great			2
in @entity153 and the @entity155 app , you can easily post to your @entity11 account			0
you can also choose what level of visibility you want a post to have and attach a @entity11 location to the object you are sharing			2
for now , videos can not be shared directly to @entity11 — only @entity163			0
but we expect that to change in the future			0
the real potential of the @entity11 integration is within the @entity93			0
users can now " like " an app directly from the @entity93 on @entity11 , and see what apps their friends like			0
this also works for @entity173			0
apps that hook into the @entity11 login in @entity15 need only request permission to do so once			1
actions still need to be explicitly performed ; users just do n't have to initiate a login each and every time			2
the nice part of all of this is that users can revoke access to an app at any time from the @entity11 panel in the @entity188 app. this makes it easy to turn a feature on or off , without having to mess with a bunch of hard - to - find settings			0
as for contacts and events and birthday integrations — these are nice features			2
@entity199 has had them since its inception			0
many @entity203 skins , such as @entity204 , also include the option			0
we appreciate that users can use @entity11 but opt not to link a calendar or address book with the service			0
siri @entity13 is finally on the @entity21 ! well , the new @entity21 , at least			1
@entity13 works just as you would expect it to — except it now hooks into @entity70 , @entity214 , @entity215 , various sports score services and more			1
users can also now launch apps , post to @entity11 and send tweets with their voice			0
in our tests , @entity13 worked as expected , though we did run into a few problems posting to @entity140			1
still , the service works quite seamlessly on the @entity21			2
for us , the more command - like nature of @entity13 — and the fact that various @entity4 tasks can now be started using voice commands — is a great step forward			2
@entity230 sharing , @entity153 , @entity231 and more one of the features i 'm really excited to use with @entity15 is the new @entity235 shares that are part of @entity237			1
users can quickly and easily share groups of photos to a select group of other users			0
just find your photo , choose " @entity230 " from the share menu and add your contacts			0
you can choose to make the collection private or visible on @entity237			0
users can then comment on photos and add their own to the collections			0
removing a photo from a @entity230 will remove it from everyone 's device			2
it 's a bit like @entity256 , but baked into the os and tied to @entity237			2
another new feature in @entity15 is the ability to @entity231 over @entity259 or @entity260			2
i tested this by calling my phone from my @entity21			1
it worked exactly as you would expect			0
my only concern with this sort of feature is that it has the potential to use up more bandwidth than users might expect			0
keep an eye on your data usage			0
@entity153 for @entity15 has a redesigned sharing menu — icon - based this time — and the ability to sync with tabs across other @entity237 devices			1
you can also now read items from @entity283 offline — which can act as a low - level replacement for @entity285 , @entity286 or @entity287			0
in my experience , heavy users of those services ( including myself ) are unlikely to give them up for the built - in options , but it 's a great way to introduce the concept of reading later to more people			2
mail @entity296 has received a few updates in @entity15 , most notably with the ability to finally inserts photos or videos in a message directly from the @entity296 app. it 's about time			1
users can also craft different signatures on a per - mailbox basis			0
@entity1 has also introduced a new vip feature that allows users to highlight email from important contacts in their own folder and with their own notification system			1
if you get as much email as i get , that 's a great feature			0
the early verdict i 'm very excited about the potential of @entity15			2
the first beta is remarkably stable and the new features are welcome			0
still , as with all @entity15 releases , the most interesting bits are usually what happens on the backend and not the flashiest user - facing features			1
some of the early criticism of @entity15 is that it is n't enough to compete with @entity203 or @entity199			1
i do n't think this is true at all			0
third party apps are what define modern smartphones and tablets and in that respect , @entity1 remains the platform of choice for developers			1
with @entity15 , it looks like developers will have even more options to create great apps for users			2
plus , this is just a taste — as the months go on , i expect we 'll learn even more about what unearthed secrets remain in the @entity15 what are you most excited about in @entity15 ? let us know in the comments			2

@entity1 introduced the next generation of its mobile operating system , @entity15 6 , this week
while certain features are n't fully baked yet , it 's clear that this is a solid @entity15 update
the @entity15 platform has heavily integrated *social* media and sharing functions with @entity13
we tested @entity15 6 on an @entity21 and not an @entity33 , so we ca n't explore all its new features
