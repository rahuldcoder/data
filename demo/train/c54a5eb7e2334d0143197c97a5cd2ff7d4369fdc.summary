-- the first question for many relatives of the victims of @entity4 , as for us after @entity5 , will be whether their loved ones suffered			1
explosive decompression of an aircraft fuselage at 35,000 feet will cause almost instantaneous loss of consciousness			2
explosive decompression is a terribly apt phrase			0
if it turns out to be true that @entity17 was hit by a @entity19 missile , their warheads contain about 140 times the explosive in the @entity5 bomb			1
it seems impossible therefore that anyone aboard could have remained aware to suffer in the aftermath			0
the essence of the tragedy of @entity4 is the suffering of the relatives			1
some will need to view the bodies of those they lost			0
surely they deserve security to say their last farewells			0
they should have that option			0
bodies need to be treated with respect and precision of identification			0
i believe that in the case of @entity4 the @entity41 should also oversee immediate sending of an international team of investigators , covered by force if necessary , to ensure that relatives ' needs , the bodies themselves and the evidence field are protected			1
it is already very late , but not too late			0
there has already been looting , abhorrent to relatives , there is something particularly unsavory about the thought of unauthorised interference with bodies , or indeed personal effects of the dead			2
there will now be some uncertainty about the evidential material on site			0
maybe the @entity41 should in future have a standby arrangement for immediate deployment of such an international " sterilizing force			0
" even in the case of @entity5 , evidence emerged in court of improper interference with potentially evidential material on the crash site within @entity74			1
in the @entity76 we found that a relatives ' group predicated on the concept of allowing everyone to grieve in their own way , but always there to support its members , helped			2
the humanist , highly caring , relative co-ordinating our group can not know how many of us she has helped through her dedication and skills			0
one of the most difficult yet most rewarding aspects of @entity90 's philosophy was to extend love to others even when they seem to be your enemy			1
we have witnessed the bitterness and personal destruction that can spring from rampant lust for revenge			1
lust for revenge is natural , but self - defeating , for the consequence of revenge is so often further revenge			1
nor does it even bring peace of mind to the avenger			0
of course we condemn the actions of perpetrators and would rightly have them punished for what they have done , but we do n't have to hate the perpetrators themselves			1
imprisoned , they may emerge one day to do good			0
the late @entity114 and archbishop @entity115 helped to create the @entity116			0
that concept can only work if truth precedes the attempts at reconciliation			2
truth may become a fickle wraith for families to pursue through the labyrinth of international politics			2
it was @entity114 too who publicly warned , long before the trial of those accused by the @entity130 and @entity76 of responsibility for @entity5 , that : " no one country should be complainant , prosecutor and judge			2
" the @entity135 ignored this warning			0
it is perhaps significant that the @entity138 , which lost far more citizens in @entity4 than any other country , finds herself already the home of the @entity143			1
powerful governments have powerful means of controlling what we know and believe			0
international courts should be immune to that			0
perversely it was the evidence produced at the @entity5 trial in @entity152 , @entity153 , which confirmed for some that @entity156 's @entity155 was responsible			2
but for other close watchers , there were doubts there which have now greatly increased and led 25 @entity76 @entity5 relatives , together with members of the family of the one @entity155 found guilty , recently to lodge a request for a third appeal against the @entity152 verdict with @entity74 's @entity167			1
nowadays we have a better route , through the @entity143 , and what those of us who are not mh17 relatives should do is to monitor and encourage all efforts to pass the whole known truth to the @entity4 relatives and to discover and detain those responsible			1
it is no coincidence that @entity153 already hosts the @entity143 , for that nation 's record in support of international justice is outstanding			1
@entity4 relatives may also find help from the small @entity76 charity disaster action			1
this can not deal with so huge a tragedy directly but carries within it wisdom distilled from @entity5 and other tragedies			1
opinion : do n't blame @entity191			2

essence of tragedy of @entity4 is suffering of relatives , **writes** father of a @entity5 victim
lust for revenge is natural , but self - defeating , @entity201 **writes**
@entity203 : we do n't have to hate the perpetrators ; @entity90 *taught* us to love our enemies
we should seek justice and truth through @entity143 , he adds
