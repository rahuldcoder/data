-- five years ago , on october 3 , 2008 , with the economy in a tailspin , president @entity1 signed the $ 700 billion @entity4 into law , giving the government the ability to bail out the big banks to prevent further calamity			1
a number of factors caused the economic collapse , but one in particular stands out -- a witch 's brew of money and politics			1
as the @entity19 wrote in its 2011 report , " it did not surprise the @entity19 that an industry of such wealth and power would exert pressure on policy makers and regulators			2
from 1999 to 2008 , the financial sector expended $ 2.7 billion in reported federal lobbying expenses ; individuals and political action committees in the sector made more than $ 1 billion in campaign contributions			2
" five years later , with millions of @entity33 still unemployed or underemployed , not much has changed			2
@entity34 is still the biggest player in @entity36			1
the industry dished out more dough than any other industry during the 2012 election			0
in the first six months of 2013 , the finance , insurance and real estate sector has already given $ 63 million to federal candidates and committees			0
it has spent $ 242 million on more than 2,000 lobbyists			0
the @entity49 financial reform was an important legislation and it has , and will continue , to protect consumers from abuses of the banks			2
but the industry played a major role in what rules were passed and it continues to play a role in the implementation of regulation rules			0
soon , the @entity61 may give bankers and wealthy special interests -- the same guys and gals who wrecked the economy in 2008 -- even more influence			1
on october 8 , the court will hear oral arguments in @entity70 v. @entity71 , a case brought by @entity73 businessman @entity70 and the @entity74 that threatens to remove the aggregate limits that individual donors can give , in total , to federal candidates and committees each election cycle			1
for the 2014 election cycle , that total is $ 123,200 -- more than double the median @entity33 family income			0
if the court sides with @entity70 , an individual donor could bundle more than $ 1 million to congressional fundraising committees			1
so what does this have to do with @entity34 and @entity4 ? plenty			1
some 28 % of the roughly 1,200 individuals who got within 10 % of the aggregate limit in the 2012 election work on @entity34			1
these super donors work at @entity92 , @entity93 and other top financial firms			1
@entity34 was the biggest industry to put money into politics			1
if aggregate limits are thrown out , a future presidential candidate could be allowed to ask for a $ 2 million donation for his campaign and various committees			0
congressional leaders could set up a fundraising committee that could take in $ 3.5 million from one donor			0
that 's a sweet deal for @entity34 , but it 's a raw deal for democracy			1
based on past precedent , the court should uphold the current limits			0
but whether the justices do or do not , our democracy is already in trouble			2
@entity116 must act to raise the voices of @entity118			0
@entity119 brings the issue home to @entity122			0
the @entity123 encourages people to legally stamp messages such as " not to be used for bribing politicians " on our nation 's currency to support reforms to # @entity131 of politics			2
every bill is seen an average of 875 times and helps demonstrate a growing , sustained demand for reform			0
one solution is modeled on successful systems in @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 , which allow candidates to run competitive campaigns for office by relying on a mix of small donations and limited public funds			0
there are a handful of similar measures already introduced in @entity116			0
they would empower small dollar donors and help them compete with the lobbyists , bankers and wealthy donors writing big checks			2
the @entity33 people want and deserve a representative democracy that represents the people , not super-rich donors			1
but unless we come together and demand change , @entity116 will continue to be owned ( or at least rented ) by big money			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 and @entity168 .			1

it 's been five years since the government bailed out banks during the economic *crisis*
@entity167 , @entity168 : today , @entity34 is still the biggest player in @entity36
in *upcoming* @entity70 v. @entity71 , @entity61 may give the rich even more power
@entity167 , @entity179 : we need democracy that represents the people , not super rich donors
