@entity0 -- at 33 , @entity2 is serving a life term without the possibility of parole in a @entity7 prison while confined to a wheelchair			1
@entity2 , now 33 , was convicted of burglary and rape when he was 13			1
he is serving a life sentence without parole			1
the crime for which he was convicted was brutal : burglary and the rape of a 72 - year - old woman in @entity16			1
the man 's lawyers say the punishment was equally harsh , particularly for someone with @entity2 's circumstances			1
he was 13 at the time , and is one of only two people his age in the world , say his supporters , tried as an adult and sentenced to " die in prison " for a crime that was n't a homicide			1
now the @entity31 is being asked to decide whether that sentence was cruel and unusual punishment for someone who was barely a teenager at the time of his crime			1
the justices are scheduled to announce monday whether they will accept the case for review			1
if they do , oral arguments would be held in the fall			0
if the review is rejected , @entity2 would have few legal options remaining to reduce his sentence			1
his lawyers are also fighting to get him a new trial			0
outside a death - penalty context , the high court has offered little recent guidance on how to treat the youngest of underage criminal defendants			0
the appellate record for rapists under age 15 is almost nonexistent , say legal experts consulted by @entity1			0
child legal advocates say many states lack adequate resources to handle young inmates given long sentences , including a lack of proper jailhouse counseling			0
few studies have been conducted on the psychological effects on young defendants facing life in prison , said the @entity67 , which is representing @entity2 in the high court case			1
" we have created a forgotten population with a lot of needs , " said @entity69 , @entity2 's lawyer			1
the crime happened in 1989 , when @entity2 later admitted he and two friends ransacked a home in @entity16			1
but he denied the prosecutor 's claim he returned with a knife and sexually assaulted the elderly homeowner			0
an older co-defendant claimed @entity2 was the rapist			2
according to the trial record , the victim testified the assailant was a youngster with " kinky hair and he was quite black and he was small			0
" she could not recognize @entity2 by his facial features , but the defendant was made to repeat at trial what he allegedly told the woman : " if you ca n't identify me , i may not have to kill you			1
" the victim testified , " it 's been six months , it 's hard , but it does sound similar			0
" after a daylong trial , @entity97 circuit court judge @entity95 sentenced @entity2 to life without parole			1
" i am going to try to send him away for as long as i can , he is beyond help , " the judge told the boy			0
" the juvenile system has been utterly incapable of doing anything with mr. @entity2			2
" @entity2 had a lengthy juvenile record , but continues to deny the attack			2
at the time , state prosecutor @entity107 , who retired last month , said , " it was a brutal crime and he had an extensive record			0
this was a bad , bad crime			0
" the @entity7 attorney general 's office told the high court that prosecutors should have the discretion they have long been given to decide how harshly young criminal should be prosecuted			0
sexual battery remains a crime punishable by life imprisonment in @entity7			2
a study by the @entity67 found eight prisoners serving life terms for crimes committed at 13 , all in the @entity124			1
besides @entity2 , @entity7 inmate @entity125 is in a similar situation			2
he was 13 when convicted of attempted murder and robbery in 1990 and will not get out of prison			2
the @entity130 reports no 13 - year - old has been given life without parole for crime that was n't a homicide in a decade			1
and while about a thousand people every year under 15 are arrested for rape , none have been given life without parole since @entity2			1
only a handful of states -- including @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 -- prohibit sentencing minors to life without a chance for parole , according to the @entity152			2
@entity67 says 19 states have laws allowing the possibility of life without parole for those under age 14			2
the high court in april 2008 refused to hear the case of a @entity163 boy who was 12 when he murdered his grandparents and was given a 30 - year sentence , the maximum allowed under state law			1
tried as an adult , @entity169 's lawyers had argued the sentence was excessive , and that heavy doses of antidepressants the boy was taking at the time sent his mind spinning out off control			0
while disappointed , @entity169 's attorney @entity177 speculated the justices may " have recognized the growing national trend against sentencing young children to harsh mandatory terms in prison , and wants to give state legislatures the opportunity to correct this problem before it rules again on the issue			0
" @entity2 's attorneys hope the high court is ready to revisit the issue			1
the @entity31 in 2005 banned the death penalty for underage killers			2
the justices in that case cited evolving " national standards " as a reason to ban such executions			0
" when a juvenile commits a heinous crime , the state can exact a forfeiture of some of the most basic liberties , " wrote justice @entity197 at the time			0
" but the state can not extinguish his life and his potential to attain a mature understanding of his own humanity			0
" @entity2 is in deteriorating health from multiple sclerosis and confined to " close management " for dangerous or trouble - prone inmates , say state corrections officials			1
his lawyers admit he has had more than a 100 incidents of fighting and threatening inmates and guards , and having contraband and weapons , but say @entity2 is the victim of bullying by other prisoners and is mentally disabled			2
" it 's important for the criminal justice system to recognize that inmates like @entity2 [ @entity2 ] are going to change , biologically , psychologically and emotionally as they grow up in prison , " said @entity69			2
" we should not assume it is a change for the worse			0
" @entity2 's appellate team places much of the blame on his original trial attorney , who presented no opening statement and only brief closing remarks			0
no dna results were offered and the state destroyed the biological evidence in 1993			0
" it was absolutely outrageous , " said @entity69			0
the trial lawyer was later suspended from practicing law			0
the thrust of their argument before the high court is not that @entity2 is innocent , nor that he seeks his freedom now , just that he deserves to someday make his case before the state parole board .			1
