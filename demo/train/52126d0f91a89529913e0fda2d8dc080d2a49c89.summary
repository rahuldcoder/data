under unprecedented scrutiny over its human rights record , @entity1 officials met with a @entity5 human rights investigator this week for the first time in 10 years			1
@entity7 , the @entity5 @entity8 on the situation of human rights in @entity1 , said he met " unexpectedly " with the delegation for about an hour on monday			1
@entity1 officials proposed the possibility of arranging a visit by human rights officials to the country			1
he said they also raised concerns about the @entity5 resolution on possible consequences against @entity1			1
@entity7 said the timing of the sudden meeting with the officials was " notable			0
" human rights pressure murder , torture , slavery , sexual violence , mass starvation -- @entity1 's leaders have been accused of employing all sorts of abuses to prop up the state and exercise control over its citizens			1
citing such violations , @entity1 's human rights situation should be referred to the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) along with the consideration of further sanctions , according to a report @entity7 submitted to the @entity42 on tuesday			1
the @entity43 and @entity44 have authored a draft resolution calling for similar penalties			0
@entity7 said the @entity5 has to come up with a way to act on the @entity1 human rights violations in a coordinated way			1
his comments come at a time when @entity1 has gone on a publicity blitz			1
its diplomats have fanned the globe in an attempt to soften its image , with its officials taking questions from journalists , speaking in public and offering talks with @entity63 , @entity44 and the @entity43			0
in what was viewed as a gesture of goodwill , @entity1 even released detained @entity68 , @entity67 last week			1
but that did n't appear to sway @entity7			0
" i welcome these signs of increased engagement by the @entity1 with the @entity72 and international community , and i hope they will bear fruit , " @entity7 said			2
" but these must be premised on a more fundamental acknowledgement of the scale of the problems and must not divert from efforts to ensure the accountability of those responsible			0
" recent pressures @entity1 has made the following overtures this month : -- it is holding talks with @entity44 's delegates in @entity87 regarding @entity44 citizens abducted decades ago			1
earlier this year , @entity44 eased several of its sanctions in exchange for information about @entity44 citizens who were abducted by @entity1 during the @entity92			2
that report has yet to be issued			0
-- @entity1 had scheduled talks with @entity63 for thursday , but that appears to have been canceled			2
@entity87 officials sent a notice saying that the @entity63 was n't creating conditions for a better relationship			0
the @entity100 in @entity63 said the meeting would be difficult to hold at this point			0
-- @entity1 has also suggested that it would be open to restarting nuclear talks , which would include the @entity68			2
it released @entity68 citizen , @entity67 from detention , although two others remain in @entity1			2
-- it has extended offers to talk about its human rights to the @entity43			1
@entity1 's stance @entity1 officials , like @entity112 , its ambassador to the @entity5 have defended the country 's human rights			1
the international community is " making very great fuss about human rights violations " and discussions persist about " referral of the international criminal justice mechanism and bringing those responsible at the highest level of the state to justice , " he said in a rare public address last week in @entity117 at the @entity118 this year , a scathing @entity5 @entity130 report was published , cataloging @entity1 's abuses that the authors said amounted to crimes against humanity			1
it recommended prosecuting @entity1 's leaders at the @entity38 for such crimes including torture , extensive political prison camps and other abuses			2
' @entity141 evidence ' of crimes against humanity " we totally and categorically reject the contents of the report			0
none of such violations exist in my country , and in no way can they exist , also , " @entity112 said			0
in order to charge @entity1 leaders , the move would have to be approved by the @entity154			2
if the matter escalates to that level , statements by @entity157 officials indicate that @entity157 , a permanent member of the @entity154 , is likely to veto the referral			0
underlying tensions critics say @entity1 's overtures are meant to deflect a coordinated international effort against the country			2
" they see a steady drumbeat of anger in the international community at @entity1 's human rights abuses and they 're worried it may actually come to fruition in terms of something quite substantial , " said @entity167 , a former director for @entity168 at the @entity169 under former president @entity170			1
the @entity68 military has also viewed @entity1 actions with skepticism			0
" they 've reached out to other countries , that has been a bit of a change , " said general @entity181 , combined forces commander of @entity68 forces in @entity63			0
" right underneath that , at the same time , they continue to pace their development of missile systems , their nuclear systems , other asymmetric means and working hard at that			0
