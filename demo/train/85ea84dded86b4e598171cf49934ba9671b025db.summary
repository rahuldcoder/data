editor 's note : @entity2 is a professor of history and public affairs at @entity6 's @entity5			1
he is the co-editor of " @entity7 : making @entity8 in the 1970s " and is completing a book on the history of national - security politics since @entity12 , to be published by @entity13			2
@entity2 writes widely on current events			2
@entity15 says @entity16 and @entity17 must decide whether to rein in presidential power			1
@entity19 , @entity20 ( @entity21 ) -- executive power has been one of the defining characteristics of president @entity26 's administration			1
president @entity26 , vice president @entity28 and many members of the @entity30 pushed to expand executive power -- as much as any specific domestic or foreign policy -- from the beginning of the administration			1
the @entity26 administration formed in a direct conversation with the presidential politics of the 1970s			1
several members of the @entity26 administration came of professional age working in the @entity41 and @entity42 administrations			1
they watched an assertive @entity17 respond to the @entity43 by revitalizing legislative power through the @entity45 , the @entity46 of 1974 , the @entity47 , and the @entity48 in 1978			1
the @entity26 administration thought vesting @entity17 with so much power was dangerous , because it saw the legislative branch as inefficient			1
building on efforts since president @entity52 to reverse the congressional reforms of the 1970s , the current @entity30 spent enormous political energy , before and after 9/11 , trying to reclaim power for the executive branch			1
the expansion of presidential power is not unique to the @entity26 administration			1
it began early in the 20th century and , despite some exceptional periods such as the 1970s , continued steadily throughout			0
but in several respects , this expansion was bigger in scale and scope than under previous presidents			0
for example , as a way to agree to legislation without agreeing to follow the intention of @entity17 , @entity26 issued statements when he signed bills -- doing so far more frequently than preceding presidents			1
when @entity17 passed a bill banning the use of torture in december 2005 , @entity26 added a signing statement allowing him to bypass the law in his role as commander - in - chief			1
@entity26 also used executive orders to achieve policy objectives without obtaining congressional consent			2
most of the president 's national security programs were also conducted under high levels of secrecy and sometimes ignored rules such as those spelled out by @entity47			0
even when @entity90 controlled @entity17 between 2002 and 2006 , the president barely consulted with the leadership			2
after the 2000 elections , many @entity90 moderates were optimistic they would have more power than ever because the @entity30 would be forced to court their vote in the evenly divided @entity96			0
@entity97 of @entity98 said he was disillusioned early in the @entity26 administration when @entity28 met with a group of @entity90 moderates			1
@entity28 simply listed the bills the administration would pursue -- such as canceling @entity105 support for the @entity106 and cutting taxes -- and informed them the president expected their vote			0
the chances for restoring a better balance of power remain unclear			0
there was a notable silence on the issue during the 2008 presidential campaign			0
congressional democrats and president - elect @entity16 have been extremely critical of @entity26 's muscular approach to the executive branch			1
but though @entity16 has promised to reverse a number of executive decisions made by @entity26 , it is hard to tell how far he will go			1
most important , it is extremely rare in the postwar period for presidents to voluntarily relinquish power			0
democrats in @entity17 might not be willing to do to @entity16 what they did to @entity41 or even @entity127 in the 1970s			1
after decades of @entity90 rule , @entity125 now believe they have an opportunity to build a new majority			0
in addition , in a time of true crisis there will be less incentive to challenge the institutional prerogatives of their president			0
but @entity17 and the @entity30 must do something to reverse the trends of the past eight years			1
we need an executive branch that is accountable and a @entity17 that is active			2
so what can be done ? the first solution is informal			0
the @entity30 must alter the dynamic with @entity17 and create strong lines of consultation with legislative leaders			1
president @entity149 worked closely with legislators during the @entity151 to develop economic ideas and figure out the nuts and bolts of legislation			0
@entity16 must do the same			2
the second solution is legislative			0
@entity17 should not be timid about passing legislation to empower the legislative branch			1
after the @entity160 reported the extensive use of executive signing statements by the @entity26 administration , there was discussion about legislation to curtail the power , but proposals for the legislation faded away			1
@entity17 needs to consider passing measures in this and other areas , such as further defining what kinds of interrogation techniques can be used by the @entity105 military and intelligence services			2
the final solution involves oversight			0
there has been a dramatic increase in congressional oversight since @entity125 took control of @entity17 in 2006			2
legislators have been more willing to hold hearings and conduct investigations into everything from the ethical conduct of the @entity30 to the administration of key government programs			0
but oversight under divided government is easier politically than under the united government -- @entity125 in charge of the @entity30 and @entity17 -- we will have after january 20			2
the aim of stronger oversight is to avoid failures such as @entity199 's inadequate response to @entity200 or the politicization at the @entity202			0
the fact that @entity125 control the @entity30 is no excuse for the party 's leaders in @entity17 to become lapdogs			0
@entity16 must be held responsible as well			0
while presidents do n't like to give up power , maybe this president will be different			0
at a minimum , @entity16 should avoid the techniques used so often in recent years to circumvent legislative will			2
it is not enough to reverse @entity26 's executive orders -- the crucial question is whether @entity16 uses such orders as frequently himself			1
if the nation can create a better balance between the executive and legislative branches , the country will benefit			0
the @entity151 proved when both branches work together , the nation can produce some of its finest and most effective programs			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity15 .			0

@entity15 : @entity26 administration sought to *rebuild* presidential power

@entity2 says @entity17 ' role was *diminished* during the @entity26 administration
