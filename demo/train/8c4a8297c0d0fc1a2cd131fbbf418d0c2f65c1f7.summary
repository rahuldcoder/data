-- if you want to see the impact of @entity4 's growing power in the @entity5 , look no further than @entity6			1
on monday , three important developments occurred simultaneously : first , world diplomats scrambled anxiously to salvage plans for a conference on @entity6 scheduled to start on wednesday			0
the " @entity12 " meeting almost went off the rails before it began , with @entity6 opposition leaders threatening to stay away unless the @entity15 retracted the invitation it had unexpectedly extended to @entity4			1
at the same time , a new report about the @entity6 civil war showed what appears to be convincing evidence of large - scale " systematic torture and killing " by the regime of @entity6 president @entity24 , @entity4 's top ally			1
the report 's authors said the new evidence could prove @entity24 and his regime are guilty of perpetrating crimes against humanity			1
and in the third major event of that day , the interim nuclear deal between @entity4 and world powers went into effect			1
under the deal negotiated in november , @entity4 suspended some of its nuclear enrichment operations , and @entity39 governments started lifting some of the economic sanctions they have used to pressure @entity42			1
opinion : @entity6 genocide needs justice these three events will be included by historians and analysts when they write the story of the turmoil of the early 21st century @entity5			1
they will note that this was a week that showed the consequences of @entity4 's gradually rising influence , as the @entity57 moved steadily toward its goal of becoming the dominant power in the region			1
not long ago , the dictator @entity24 appeared on the verge of losing power to a popular uprising			2
president @entity65 declared he " must get out of the way			0
" but his regime 's loyal allies in @entity42 sent in reinforcements			0
at the urging of its @entity4 patrons , @entity72 's @entity71 militia , @entity70 , moved its forces across the border into @entity6 , helping to turn the tide of the war and adding to its increasing radicalization			1
the war went from a grassroots democratic movement to a brutal showdown between @entity84 extremists -- whose strongest elements now include @entity87 fighters -- against @entity71 forces loyal to @entity4 and @entity24			2
now the @entity6 war , which has displaced millions of civilians and has killed more than 130,000 , according to the @entity91 , is spilling into @entity72 , @entity92 and elsewhere			0
it has become a proxy war for regional rivalries , with @entity84 states , including @entity97 and @entity98 , supporting the opposition , and @entity4 , along with @entity70 , standing steadfastly with @entity24 by providing him with manpower , ammunition and intelligence			2
@entity4 has not only saved @entity24 , it has changed the character of the fight			2
it has turned it into a much more dangerous regional conflict , all but eliminating the prospects for a positive outcome anytime soon and adding to the indescribable suffering of the @entity6 people			0
where do @entity4 's nuclear program and the agreement with world powers fit into all this ? the interim deal was meant to freeze the nuclear program in place for six months while a final agreement is negotiated			1
but the announcement of the deal late last year immediately transformed the landscape			0
in the eyes of @entity127 states , the @entity124 was taking the first steps towards capitulating before @entity4 's aspirations			1
the @entity4 regime 's goal is to spread its version of @entity134 revolution and to make @entity4 the most powerful country in the region			2
the sight of top @entity124 and @entity139 diplomats rushing to @entity12 to negotiate with @entity4 sent a strong message			1
within days , the balance of power started shifting			0
countless delegations crossed the @entity143 , as @entity127 rulers allied with @entity145 sought to strengthen ties with @entity42			2
@entity97 officials railed against the @entity124			0
one reason @entity4 signed the interim deal is that it has already achieved a great deal of what it sought with its nuclear program			1
under the so - called @entity153 , @entity4 has suspended uranium enrichment above 5 % and will start getting rid of its 20 % - enriched uranium , which is close to weapons grade			0
but nobody thinks the deal , as it stands now , is a solution			0
in some respects , @entity4 is already a nuclear power , although it does n't yet have the full immunity that nuclear weapons would create			2
as if to reinforce that point , @entity4 's top nuclear negotiator , @entity166 , told @entity4 television that if @entity42 decided to resume enrichment to its previous levels , it could do it in 24 hours			1
the @entity170 dismissed the statement as meant for domestic consumption			0
but the fact is that @entity4 is not dismantling its centrifuges			0
it is just unplugging them			0
in the meantime , @entity4 's economy has already started recovering			1
@entity139 , @entity179 and @entity127 businessmen are lining up to make deals with a resurgent @entity4			2
@entity127 diplomats are speaking in measured tones about their @entity143 neighbor , but behind the scenes , the worries are palpable			0
the mere prospect of an @entity4 presence at the @entity12 talks came close to scuttling the diplomatic effort			0
the @entity15 withdrew the invitation after the rebels said they would not attend , and both @entity145 and @entity192 pressured the @entity193 already @entity4 and @entity6 have indicated they have no intention of supporting the meeting 's official goal of creating a transitional government to end @entity6 's war			1
@entity6 's regime will likely become more beholden to @entity4 than ever			1
a stronger @entity4 would deepen the divisions separating @entity84 and @entity71 , @entity127 and @entity201 , @entity97 and @entity4 , palestinians and @entity204 , making them all but impossible to bridge			2
the region would become a greater threat to itself and the world			0
the talks in @entity209 will now start			0
but the fighting , torture and killing in @entity6 will continue , even as former war crimes prosecutors say @entity24 is viciously slaughtering his own people			2
in the end , much of the @entity5 's future will depend on whether negotiators can find a way to stop @entity4 from advancing its power to the point where it becomes essentially invulnerable			1
otherwise , the region will become an even more dangerous and desperate place , as we see today in @entity6			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226			0

@entity226 : @entity6 a good example of @entity4 's growing power in the @entity5
she says @entity4 is the top *backer* for @entity24 's regime , which commits reported *atrocities*
she says @entity124 wants new @entity6 government ; @entity4 's backing makes @entity24 unlikely to deal
@entity239 : interim nuclear deal makes allied @entity127 nations fear the @entity242 will weaken
