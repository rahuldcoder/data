-- remember that messiness when @entity2 and @entity3 were battling it out on air ? or when @entity2 and @entity5 used to trade jabs during their monologues ? neither do we			1
these days the late - night focus is on the @entity11 : @entity12 and @entity13			1
@entity15 has managed to keep fans riveted with expectations over what musical guest might pop up next in a way that has n't happened since @entity21 left the air ( admit it , you sang along when @entity23 did " @entity24 " ) and capitalized on the boyish charm that made him star of " @entity28 " on " @entity29			0
" meanwhile @entity13 has been everywhere recently , from the cover of @entity31 to ruling the web on friday after his " nemesis " @entity34 took over his show thursday night in what turned out to be one seriously funny @entity38 roast			1
thursday night 's temporarily renamed show , " @entity40 , " was the result of a long - time " feud " between @entity38 and the @entity43 winning @entity34 and helped pull in the viewers			1
it proved to be so successful that @entity46 has announced it will re-air the episode during prime time tuesday night			0
according to a press release , the show resulted in @entity38 's highest ratings since his show moved to the 11:35 p.m. time slot this month			0
it ranked @entity56 among late - night talk shows in both households and among the coveted 18 - 49 demographic , beating " @entity60 with @entity2 " by 62 % and " the @entity61 with @entity5 " by 120 %			1
but do n't expect @entity13 to rave about that fact on his official @entity64 account , or anywhere else for that matter			0
during a recent appearance before a group of television critics , it was announced that @entity13 had beaten @entity5 in the ratings			1
the @entity72 reported that when asked what it was like to " kill @entity5 " in the ratings , @entity13 was quick to retort " i 'm not killing @entity5 " and point out that @entity5 's ratings had not changed since @entity13 's show replaced " @entity78 " in its time slot			1
that could be despite the fact that @entity5 is his competition , @entity13 has a deep respect for the fellow funnyman			2
" if i beat @entity5 in the ratings , does that mean i 'm better than @entity5 ? " @entity13 recently told @entity31			1
" no f * * * ing way			0
" the talk show host had less kind words for @entity2 , telling the publication , " as a comedian , you ca n't not have disdain for what he 's done : he totally sold out			2
so how is @entity13 ensuring that @entity46 's gamble to move his show from midnight to its new slot to make it more competitive will pay off ? at this point , it seems just by being himself and continuing with what has led him to this point			2
@entity13 was n't afraid to show his softer , fan side last @entity105 when his hero @entity5 appeared on his show			1
he showed his idol photos of his 18th birthday cake , which sported the " @entity111 " logo			0
he charmed first lady @entity112 when she appeared on his show in october and won rave reviews last year when he hosted both the @entity114 and the @entity115			0
@entity116 of the @entity117 tracks trends and told @entity119 that @entity38 is a bit of the late - night everyman			1
" i have always considered @entity13 the gen y version of @entity2 , " @entity116 said			2
" he has that @entity123 , down - to - earth humor that @entity2 represented without the @entity126 weirdness that has such limited appeal			0
" he also clearly does n't mind being the butt of the joke as he was thursday night as celeb friend after celeb friend ( including ex-love @entity132 ) took shots at him			2
after all , this is a comic who dressed as a plumber with his crack showing for the cover of @entity31			0
@entity140 that , @entity2 and @entity5 .			0

@entity13 's thursday night show won *big* ratings
actor @entity34 " *kidnapped* " @entity13 and took over the show
@entity13 has been *challenging* the late - night lead of @entity5 and @entity2
