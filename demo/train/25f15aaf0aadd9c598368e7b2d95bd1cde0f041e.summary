-- what makes a classic dive bar ? is it the sticky floors or the peanut shells ? the killer juke box ? the heady aroma of stale beer and the haze of a million cigarettes ? ( in some states , anyway			1
) these are all things that are worth debating , and we welcome you to disagree with the picks below			2
the definition we decided on includes decades of history and everything from octogenarian bartenders and surly bouncers to pooping chickens and giggling ghosts			2
most of all , these are neighborhood standbys , the places you go because you know what you 're going to get , and more importantly , what you 're not going to get			2
like website marketing or a @entity32 site , which is why you wo n't see a lot of links below			2
dirty fun guide to @entity37 , @entity39 bars everyone has a different level of tolerance when it comes to dives			2
but if genuine character is what you seek , then these nine neighborhood joints wo n't disappoint			2
@entity49 , @entity50 years before the @entity52 , owner and former boxer @entity51 was slinging $ 4 beers and swapping fighting tales at this @entity50 institution			2
he still does today , in his 80s			2
the jukebox is a time warp , too : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity63 reign supreme			0
listen long enough and you 'll become a regular			0

every sunday proprietor @entity79 plops a chicken down on a plywood bingo board			1
if the bird poops on your number , you win the money in the pot -- plenty for a healthy round of $ 2 @entity89			1
the scene might appear a little rough , but the patrons are affable and accustomed to following @entity71 's posted rules : " no cussin ' , @entity95 ' , @entity94 ' , @entity93 ' ! " @entity71 's @entity70 , 5434 burnet road , @entity72 , @entity73 ; + 1 512 458 1813 ; tuesday 5 p.m. - midnight , wednesday - saturday 5 p.m. -1 a.m. , sunday 2 - 8 p.m. @entity96 , @entity97 it 's hipsters and yuppies versus bike messengers and @entity103 bros at this @entity97 beer haven with more than 40 brews on tap			1
the bloody @entity107 is praised as the best in the city , if you can manage to grab the attention of an ornery and well - inked bartender			0
did n't get what you ordered ? do not under any circumstances complain			0
just drink it and like it			0
the outdoor beer garden with picnic tables makes all that gruffness worth it			1
although the garden 's infamous portable toilets have been replaced with real restrooms , the @entity122 still maintains plenty of gritty charm			1

where else in @entity132 ( or the @entity69 ) can you keep two people entertained all night for less than $ 20 ? curious characters abound , but the bartenders are fast and ( mostly ) friendly , assuming you do n't cause a major ruckus			0
if you do , there 's a police station across the street			1

the regulars at each spot argue that their neighborhood dive is the best in town			0
but not every corner bar feels like drinking in your grandmother 's basement			1
@entity162 , who 's been running the joint since the late 1970s , can usually be found sitting next to a cluster of ancient tchotchkes under a string of drooping , colored lights			1
none of the decades - old furniture matches , the jukebox selection is limited and the @entity171 is two bucks			0

the friendly apparitions are just @entity182 and @entity183 , two sisters who ran this former dry goods store and brothel a million years ago			0
upstairs you can explore the dimly lit old brothel -- remnants include a rusty refrigerator , discarded pinball machine and clawfoot tub			0
keep heading down the hall and you 'll find @entity195 , an elderly gentleman who serves cheap drinks and shares plenty of local history			0
downstairs you can order a famous " soul burger			0

his portrait hangs above the cash register			0
bartenders donning suits add @entity218 to the place , but not enough to disqualify the @entity207 as a true @entity221 dive			0
the embedded grime dates to the 1930s			0

the neon lights outside scream @entity227 , the black - tiled floors inside scream , " we have n't been waxed since 1926 ! " and these characteristics appear to be celebrity bait : @entity239 and @entity240 have been spotted here			1
