-- @entity2 secretary of state @entity1 made a previously unannounced visit to @entity4 on monday to repair strained relations with president @entity6 as the @entity2 - led international force continues to prepare to end its combat mission next year			1
@entity1 's stop came on the same day that @entity2 forces turned over control of a prison that has caused tension between the two nations , with @entity2 retaining a say on the handling of certain @entity18 inmates			1
the talks on monday followed controversial comments by @entity6 in recent weeks that seemed to accuse @entity2 forces of working with the @entity18 to kill @entity4 civilians , a charge denied by @entity2 officials			1
@entity6 's reported remarks caused outrage in @entity26 with some in @entity27 questioning why the @entity2 should continue the war effort			1
at a joint news conference after meeting @entity1 , @entity6 said he had been misinterpreted when quoted as alleging collusion between the @entity2 and the @entity18			1
@entity2 hands over @entity4 prison but he made clear that violence against villagers must stop for there to be any chance for successful peace talks			1
@entity6 explained that he was talking about @entity18 violence , especially how a bombing in @entity39 that killed nine people did n't help achieve the @entity18 goal of getting foreign troops to withdraw			0
he said media reports misinterpreted his comments to mean he was accusing the @entity18 and @entity2 of collusion			0
" if they want the international community to leave @entity4 , then the best way is for them to stop killing people , " @entity6 said of the @entity18			2
" that does not mean a collusion between the @entity2 and @entity18			0
that 's a conclusion the press came up with			0
" @entity6 also said some @entity2 special forces in @entity56 province had tortured and killed @entity4 civilians , but that had stopped when those forces were removed under a recent agreement after his government complained			1
he made sure to emphasize his appreciation for @entity2 support , twice declaring the thanks of the @entity4 people for @entity2 assistance that he said would " enable @entity4 to manage itself through 2014 and beyond			1
" for his part , @entity1 emphasized the commitment of president @entity70 to @entity4 and its people would continue past the halt in combat operations by the @entity75 forces before the end of next year			1
the @entity2 and @entity4 are negotiating an agreement that would allow some @entity2 forces to remain in @entity4 beyond the end of the @entity75 mission , but unresolved issues include how many and there specific role			2
@entity1 said @entity70 " was committed to not allow @entity2 's investment and the sacrifice here to be reversed , " adding that " the @entity2 will still be playing a role and will be here through the course of this future period			2
" meanwhile , the former commander of the international military force in @entity4 , @entity2 gen. @entity93 , said monday that the war there would continue after foreign troops conclude their combat mission by the end of 2014			1
" on the first of january , there 's still going to be fighting in 2015			0
there 's still going to be fighting in @entity4 , " @entity93 told a conference at the @entity102			0
he added that @entity4 would " join a long and distinguished list of countries that will be struggling in a post-conflict environment where it will have an insurgency in some parts of that country for an extended period of time			0
" @entity1 landed in @entity39 on monday afternoon and met with @entity6 at the presidential palace before the news conference that lasted almost an hour			1
the two were to talk further over dinner and perhaps again on tuesday morning , @entity1 said			0
earlier monday , the @entity2 handed over control of a @entity2 - run prison near @entity119 to @entity4 authorities			1
@entity6 called the development a major boost for the transition , while @entity1 emphasized several times that the agreement respected @entity4 's sovereignty to operate the prison that holds @entity18 figures			1
the agreement includes provisions to give the @entity2 a say on how some of the most notorious @entity18 prisoners are handled			0
@entity6 outlined a process in which @entity2 officials provide intelligence to @entity4 officials on specific prisoners , and further consultations follow if the @entity4 want to set them free			1
in a sign of the sensitivity of the issue , @entity6 twice described the final step of the process as consultations , then changed his wording to " an exchange of views			0
" he said that " i must use my words carefully			0
" " we will consider it , " he said of a @entity2 request to keep particular prisoners in custody , adding that @entity4 law would call for such handling of anyone posing a legitimate threat			2
the matter touches on a politically charged situation for @entity6 , who is criticized by the @entity18 and other foes for the continuing presence of the @entity75 forces in the country			0
the handover deal was reached saturday , but came a full year after the initial plan was announced by @entity2 and @entity4 authorities			2
an initial plan called for the prison and detainees to be handed over within six months , but in september , the @entity2 " paused " the transfer of detainees , which include suspected @entity18 militants and insurgents			2
other tensions between the countries involve continuing violence , such as a bomb blast in @entity39 this month that killed nine people			0
@entity6 said afterward that there are " ongoing daily talks between the @entity18 , @entity2 and foreigners in @entity182 and in the @entity183			2
" the comment effectively claimed the @entity2 was trying to foment continued violence inside @entity4 , and it was quickly denounced by @entity75 and @entity2 officials			2
some experts say @entity6 's comments were fueled by frustration over the detention facility not being handed over sooner , which he viewed as an attack on his country 's sovereignty			0
during the news conference , @entity1 repeatedly referred to @entity4 's sovereignty in the transition process as the @entity75 military force turns over leadership of combat operations to @entity4 's military , which it has trained in recent years			1
under an agreement between the @entity4 government and @entity75 , the bulk of @entity2 and @entity75 combat forces are to be out of @entity4 by the end of 2014			1
what remains to be decided is how many troops may remain to help train @entity4 forces			0
the trip was @entity1 's first visit to @entity4 as secretary of state , but the former senator 's sixth during @entity70 's presidency			1
he was in @entity215 over the weekend to press that nation 's leaders to take steps prohibiting @entity220 planes from delivering arms to @entity223 's besieged government			0
last week , @entity1 joined @entity70 on a trip to @entity225 , the @entity227 territories and @entity228			0
@entity0 's @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 contributed to this report .			0
