-- an election - year democratic measure designed to ensure that women do n't face pay discrimination was blocked tuesday by @entity4 who complained that the bill was politically inspired and would reward trial lawyers at the expense of employers			1
the motion , which needed 60 votes to succeed , got only 52 , not one from a @entity4			2
president @entity11 issued a statement criticizing republicans for putting " partisan politics ahead of @entity16 women and families			0
" senate majority leader @entity18 , @entity19 , standing at a news conference with pay equity advocate @entity21 , accused @entity4 of " wanting to stick their heads in the sand " about the longstanding issue of women being paid less than men			1
" but it 's clear where @entity29 stand , " @entity18 said			2
the bill , which @entity29 said would close loopholes in the 1963 @entity32 , would require employers to prove that differences in pay were related to job performance , not gender ; would prevent employers from forbidding employees from sharing salary information with each other ; and would allow women who believe they were discriminated against to sue for damages			1
democrats acknowledged privately that they expected to make political gains with women by pressing to close the pay gap , which they said has women earning just 77 cents on the dollar compared with men			2
republicans , fearful that @entity29 were trying to portray them as insensitive to women , argued that they oppose pay discrimination but disagree with the @entity29 ' bill , which was written without their input			1
republicans remained largely silent about the issue in the days leading up to the vote , even as @entity29 , led by the president , made an all - out push for the legislation			0
only one @entity4 senator , @entity58 of @entity59 , who is in a tight re-election race against @entity29 rep. @entity61 , spoke on the floor against the bill			1
in his brief speech , @entity58 proposed an alternative bill to combat the problem , but @entity29 criticized it as insufficient			2
off the floor , a few @entity4 spoke about the bill , but only when asked by reporters			2
" we think it is the wrong way of going about dealing with this issue , " said sen. @entity70 of @entity71 , the minority leader , who described the measure as a reward for @entity75 trial lawyers			1
" this is just politics			0
this should be called the trial lawyers bonanza bill , " complained sen. @entity80 of @entity81 , the top @entity4 on the @entity83 labor committee			1
" it has nothing to do with the women			0
they will get very little out of it			0
what it allows is huge class - action suits with very little defense by any employer			0
" even the retiring moderate @entity4 senator from @entity97 , @entity98 , whose support @entity29 hoped to win , called the @entity29 ' bill " regrettable " and an " overreach			1
" " i think there are other ways ( of ) addressing these issues , and this legislation goes too far , " @entity101 said			0
the bill " would put a tremendous burden on employers through lawsuits , class - action lawsuits			0
" sen. @entity111 , @entity112 , the chief sponsor of the pay equity bill , vowed to return to the bill until it passes			1
" we will be back , " she said			0
" though we lost the vote today , we are not giving up for equal pay , for equal rights			0

@entity29 say bill would ensure that women do n't face pay discrimination
@entity4 counter that it would reward trial lawyers at employers ' expense
sponsor vows to bring measure back until it passes
