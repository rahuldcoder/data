@entity0 -- @entity2 poisoned dogs			2
a millionaire on the run			2
come thursday , deportation may be the latest twist to the saga of software mogul @entity10			1
@entity10 , who was on the run for weeks to evade questioning in his neighbor 's death , was detained in @entity0 on wednesday after entering the country illegally , officials there said			1
he may be sent back to @entity17 on thursday so officials there can question him , said @entity19 , a spokesman for @entity0 's president			1
for those following the tale of @entity10 , the man who amassed a fortune by running and then selling an antivirus software company named after him , this new twist should come as no surprise			1
his arrival in @entity0 is the latest scene in a true story that reads like a @entity33 tale			2
the case began to unfold on november 9 , when @entity10 told police someone had poisoned four of his dogs			1
to put them out of their misery , he shot each in the head and buried them on his property , a former girlfriend said			0
officials say the dogs ' barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between @entity10 and his neighbor , @entity55 businessman @entity53			1
then @entity53 turned up dead -- two days after the poisoning -- with a gunshot wound to the head			0
he was in his own living room			0
a 9 mm shell was found on the second step on the first floor , and @entity53 was found dead on the second floor of the home in a remote area of @entity17			2
authorities in @entity17 have wanted to question @entity10 about the death			1
he refused and then went into hiding			0
three people have been detained for questioning in the killing , police have said , and investigators are pursuing multiple leads			0
" i had nothing to do with his death , " @entity10 wrote on his website tuesday in a message to @entity53 's family			2
" i have lost five close family members in my 67 years and i know your suffering			0
" though being in hiding , the @entity85 tycoon has kept an active online presence			0
he also granted an interview to @entity1 last week to explain why he did not want to talk to police			0
he said he feared for his life			0
he said authorities wanted to persecute him for his refusal to pay a bribe			2
" i will certainly not turn myself in , and i will certainly not quit fighting			0
i will not stop my blog , " he said			0
his blog and accusations seemed to anger and baffle authorities in @entity17			1
" he 's really gone out of his way to make the country look bad , and we just believe he should , if he 's innocent as he 's saying he is , he should bring in his lawyer , and let 's get to the bottom of this and say what he needs to say and let 's move on , " @entity99 , a spokesman for the @entity100 , said this week			2
then @entity10 turned up in neighboring @entity0 on wednesday , to the surprise of authorities there			1
that same day , the country 's foreign minister said he did not know how @entity10 got there			1
there was no registry of @entity10 entering legally at any official border crossing , foreign minister @entity115 told reporters			1
his lawyer , @entity120 , filed a formal request for asylum with @entity124 officials wednesday			1
but by wednesday night @entity10 , was detained and his asylum request was " suspended , " said the presidential spokesman			1
" any citizen of any country must be expelled if they enter @entity0 illegally			0
this is what has occurred at this time			0
because of this , he is in the custody of immigration , so they can conclude the administrative process , and then he will be expelled from the country , " @entity19 said			2
it was unclear what the next move would be in this saga that has now become an international news story			0
but it seems the next chapter will be written right where this all started			0
a bizarre visit to @entity10 's pleasure palace in @entity17 @entity1 's @entity149 contributed from @entity150 and journalist @entity151 from @entity0			1

@entity10 could be deported to @entity17 on thursday , a @entity124 official says
@entity124 immigration authorities detain him a day earlier
his lawyer files a request for asylum with the @entity124 government
