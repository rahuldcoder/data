@entity1 , @entity0 -- if you ever try your hand at farming spiders , you 'll very soon discover it 's no easy task			2
@entity7 in a bunch of golden orb weavers -- the queens of the web - spinning world -- will earn you only a few milligrams of ultra-tough spider 's silk			1
that 's if they do n't eat each other first , explains dr. @entity17			0
bug catcher as a boy , dr @entity17 loved hunting for creepy crawlies -- but was never a fan of spiders			1
today , @entity17 's day - job involves persuading people to implant the creatures ' silky secretions under their skin -- with the promise that the fiber will weave together damaged tissue			1
it 's a " quantum leap , " admits dr @entity17 , but his creation could one day relieve agony for millions			1
watch the video above to see how the dr @entity17 created the @entity38 implant			1
thread of life @entity17 , now the ceo of biomaterials producers @entity42 explains that silk produced by spiders is not just naturally tough -- 25 times the strength of steel -- it is also " biocompatible			2
" the close similarity between molecules in the spider silk and proteins in the human body means human cells can grow into the fiber			2
when implanted in the human body , a device made from spiders silk would encourage the surrounding cells to " repopulate the device with actual human living tissue , " @entity17 says			1
" if you 've got a very strong , resilient material which also has a lot of similarities to tissues in the human body , it 's a great place to start for trying to make a medical implant			2
" watch : ' the night i invented 3d printing ' saved by the silkworm instead of fighting the spider 's cannibal instinct , and meager rate of production , @entity17 's team set about creating fake spider 's silk -- made from the same fibers that go into high class scarves			1
the team took silkworms , which produce 1000 times as much silk as a spider , and broke it down to the basic molecules			0
re-spinning this so that all the proteins are closely aligned -- just how a spider does -- creates a far stronger fiber than the silkworm can			0
or -- when @entity94 presents their finished product -- a rubber - looking crescent - shaped implant			0
friends in knees the @entity38 implant is soon destined for knee joints , where @entity17 believes it can help people with damaged cartilage to regrow the shock - absorbing tissue			1
without this implant , millions of people have no option but to resort to total knee replacement surgery			1
as of 2010 , over 600,000 total knee replacements are performed annually in the @entity108 alone , and estimates suggest that this figure will increase 6-fold by 2030			0
this marks a $ 13 billion - per - year cost for @entity108 , which is set to rise as the ageing baby boomer generation battle age - related conditions such as osteoarthritis , but demand to stay active			0
the first round of trialists are set to start receiving @entity38 implants this year , and @entity17 hopes they will pave the way for others to avoid knee replacement : " if the clinical trials go well , we hope to have this available for patients within the next two to three years			1
" beyond the knee @entity17 sees future applications in other joints -- " the hip , the shoulder , ankle , all of these suffer osteoarthritis " -- as well as in the cartilage discs between the bones in the spine			2
it does n't stop there , either : " if you 've got a technology that integrates very well with the body -- which allows cells to grow down into it -- then bones and joints certainly are n't the only tissues in the body that you could look to address			0
" in the long term , @entity17 imagines silk platforms being used to patch up intestines , hernias , and muscles -- including in the heart			1
there 's even the suggestion that -- one day -- it could fix a severed spine : " is there the potential for nerve repair ? well , the chaps [ research scientists ] at @entity165 have certainly started looking at nerve repair as an interesting further application of this technology			0
and they 've got some promising early results certainly			0
" " that obviously is far , far earlier than the stage that we 're at ... " watch : the technology bringing @entity174 , @entity175 back to life spider thread revisited for now , relieving the agony of knee pain is motivation enough			0
and all this has given him a new perspective on the crawling spider : " spiders i suppose are very different from when i was turning over rocks and looking underneath them and when i was a kid			0
" i do n't so much see the eight legs crawling around and the sharp pair of fangs -- i see something that can spin me a remarkable material , and that 's very exciting , as a scientist			0

is this knee implant really made from spider 's silk ?
dr @entity17 has created @entity38 implant that allows cells to " grow into " it
it could help thousands of people to avoid knee replacement surgery
eventually , the material could help repairall varieties of human tissue -- including nerves
