@entity0 -- for six days , @entity2 has carried out a large - scale air offensive in @entity0 , aiming to halt destructive and sometimes deadly rocket launches emanating from the @entity6 territory			1
monday saw more carnage , more heated words and more damage on both sides			0
there was also more movement toward a possible intensification as @entity14 , @entity2 's ambassador to the @entity15 , said @entity2 had finished its planning for a ground invasion of @entity0			1
if @entity2 troops do invade , @entity19 leader @entity18 said it would " not be a picnic			1
" " we do not want escalation , nor do we call for a ground war , " he said monday			1
" but we are not afraid of it , nor will we back down			0
" online campaign seeks end to violence all this violence and rhetoric has intensified international efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis , starting with a cease - fire			0
" this must stop , " @entity36 @entity35 ban ki - moon said late sunday			0
a steady stream of @entity36 and @entity40 diplomats have and will be traversing the region trying to calm the situation			0
on monday , @entity35 and an @entity2 delegation went to @entity44 , where that nation 's top intelligence official presented @entity2 a letter outlining @entity19 ' proposal for a cease - fire , said a general in @entity44 intelligence who is optimistic about a deal being reached			1
the fighting has challenged @entity2 's relationship with @entity44 , yet @entity2 president @entity56 on monday praised @entity44 president @entity57 for playing a " constructive role			1
" @entity2 foreign ministry spokesman @entity59 confirmed late monday that " negotiations are going on " that may lead to a cease - fire , though he did n't offer any details			1
meanwhile , @entity67 secretary - general @entity66 and 16 foreign ministers from the league 's member states were to arrive in @entity0 on tuesday , to be joined by @entity72 foreign minister @entity71 , a spokesman for the organization said			0
@entity15 warships move into region @entity0 itself has been under a crippling economic embargo since @entity19 won control of the territory from the @entity82 - led @entity81 , which controls the @entity83 , after a landslide 2007 election that was followed by @entity86 clashes			1
the @entity15 , @entity2 and the @entity87 characterize the militant fundamentalist @entity89 organization @entity19 as a terrorist group			1
in the @entity83 , @entity81 president @entity91 will hold talks with the @entity36 secretary - general , according to @entity94 , a member of the @entity96 's executive committee and an @entity91 ally			0
the @entity83 has been relatively quiet , though a @entity6 protester did die monday -- two days after he and others clashed with @entity2 troops -- @entity102 hospital director @entity101 said			1
and @entity2 troops shot and killed a 22 - year - old @entity6 near @entity104 , witnesses said			1
diplomats hope to avoid a repeat of 2008 , when at least 1,400 died as @entity2 troops invaded @entity0 after a similar spate of rocket attacks			2
@entity2 has signaled it is open to a cease - fire , but only if @entity0 militants halt rocket attacks			2
air raid sirens yet again resounded all day monday around @entity2 , where rocket attacks have killed three and wounded 68 according to @entity2 officials			2
the bloodshed might be worse if not for the " @entity115 , " @entity2 's missile defense system that has intercepted about 30 % of the rockets fired from @entity0 since last week , including more than half the 67 fired on monday , according to the @entity118			2
the missile defense system intercepted several more rockets fired monday at @entity121 , the @entity118 said			0
but several rockets hit @entity123 , also in southern @entity2 , with one striking a closed school			2
" they have a choice			0
the minute they will stop ( shooting ) , it will stop , " @entity56 said			2
@entity2 government spokesman @entity130 said a short - term " @entity132 " solution wo n't do			1
@entity2 government hit with more 44 million cyberattacks " there 's no doubt that @entity19 would agree to an immediate cease - fire , but it would n't mean anything			1
we want to know when it 's over , that it 's really over , " he said , adding @entity2 will use diplomacy or military force -- whatever is necessary -- to ensure that southern @entity2 does n't continue to face the threat of rockets			1
like @entity130 , @entity148 prime minister @entity147 said there ca n't be a repeat of 2008 -- though he has a different view as to why			0
having gone to @entity0 a few weeks ago and observed " the miserable life " of residents there , @entity152 told @entity1 's @entity155 it 's not tenable for there to be more assassinations of @entity19 leaders and @entity2 forces surrounding @entity0 , as was the case four years ago			1
" ( @entity19 wants ) a complete package for the cease - fire , " he said			2
@entity163 : running for shelter in @entity121 @entity6 health officials said 104 people , among them women and children , have been killed -- at least 24 on monday			2
they also say 860 have been wounded in @entity0 since @entity2 began its offensive in response to what @entity2 characterized as incessant rocket attacks by militants			2
@entity2 authorities say they take great pains to avoid civilian casualties , though this is difficult to do when rockets are being launched from densely populated civilian areas , where suspected militant leaders are also based			2
while saying he feels an agreement can be reached , @entity6 parliament member @entity180 says he blames @entity2 for the bloodshed thus far			1
" the problem is that @entity2 is using the bombardment of civilians and the killing of children as a tool of negotiations , " he said			1
too young to understand but not to die smoke and fire poured from @entity0 buildings that had been struck by @entity2 warplanes or drone on monday , when @entity2 's military said it carried out 80 strikes in addition to the 1,300 executed since last wednesday			2
@entity198 , @entity19 ' television station , reported that @entity2 tanks were firing into @entity200 in northern @entity0 , with one of its reporters saying that the @entity203 in @entity0 had been hit			1
a @entity0 stadium , where the @entity118 said @entity19 militants launched rockets toward @entity2 three days ago , was among the sites hit on monday			1
@entity2 forces also hit a @entity0 office building used by some media outlets -- as they had sunday -- killing two , including the head of the @entity213 's military media office			2
that strike targeted four senior @entity213 members who @entity2 's military said were hiding in the building , including the information chief , @entity2 's military said			0
the others were described as key figures in military training , attack planning , long - range rocket operations and arms manufacturing within the same organization			0
how the @entity225 has changed the situation in @entity0 " we targeted only the second floor , which is where the senior terrorists were , " the @entity118 said on @entity227 , adding that reporters had been used as human shields			0
" the rest of the building was unharmed			0
" calls for a truce came on the heels of the single deadliest attack -- an @entity2 airstrike in @entity0 on sunday that left a family of 10 dead within a building 's broken concrete and mangled metal			0
@entity244 , @entity19 ' military arm , called it a " massacre committed by @entity2 occupation " on @entity227			1
the @entity2 airstrike targeted @entity249 , " a senior @entity19 member , " said lt. col. @entity251 , the @entity118 ' chief spokeswoman			1
the @entity118 alleges @entity252 is one of the leaders of a @entity19 rocket - launching unit			0
as it 's happening : @entity1 reports on the ground the building hit was a known hiding place for @entity252 -- though not his home , as was reported earlier -- @entity251 said			0
initially , the @entity118 reported it killed @entity252 in the attack			0
but late sunday , @entity251 said she did not know for sure whether @entity252 had been killed			0
@entity2 military capt. @entity264 added monday that , " very regrettably , " the @entity266 family was inside the building			0
@entity130 later told @entity1 's @entity268 , " obviously , it was a foul - up " -- saying that while @entity2 does n't know exactly what happened and believes @entity19 is using civilians as human shields , it is " a failure " every time an innocent bystander is killed			1
that same day , hundreds gathered at the @entity278 mosque for a funeral of some family members killed , @entity1 's @entity275 reported			0
the firing of rockets before and after the funeral did n't deter some mourners			0
" @entity285 , revenge , " they chanted			0
talking monday night with @entity1 's @entity287 , @entity56 insisted @entity2 has nothing against people in @entity0 or @entity290 , in general			1
he said his country 's aim -- and the only reason it launched its military offensive -- is to keep its own citizens safe			0
" we do n't hate them			1
we do n't try to get any glories , " the @entity2 president said			1
" we want to live in peace			0
" security clearance : why @entity2 might hesitate to invade @entity1 's @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity275 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 and @entity312 contributed to this report .			0

new : an @entity2 spokesman confirms negotiations are *ongoing* , does n't give details
new : " we do n't hate ( @entity321 ) *...* we want to live in peace , " @entity56 says
@entity2 has finished preparations for a ground invasion , an @entity2 ambassador says
@entity6 do n't want ground war , " but we are not afraid of it , " @entity19 ' leader says
