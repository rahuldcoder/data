did crawling into the grungy mall @entity1 's lap as a child send you into peals of laughter instead of hysterical sobs ? did you love the sight of rock - hard fruit cake ? did you start your countdown to the most glorious day of the year in mid-august ? then you just may be a @entity11 addict			1
and if the usual flow of sickly sweet candy canes and maniacal christmas songs does n't quench your passion for the season , any of these places will fill you with @entity11 until the tinsel is pouring out of your ears and you 're begging for mercy			1
@entity22 , @entity23 @entity24 , @entity23 's , @entity22 may be as close to the real @entity22 as you ever get , and trust us : this place is @entity11 to the core			1
take a trolley ride away from the all of the " sugar 's bad for you " and " commercialism is ruining our society " humbugs and escape deep into the fir trees to arrive at the brightly painted @entity1 's village			2
let your imagination transform you into a squeaky elf as you try your hand at toy making in the elves ' workshop and then ensure that everything looks up to par by doing " quality control			1
" swoon over the magic that somehow delivers all of those presents on christmas eve with a peek at @entity1 's treasured sleigh			2
when you do n't think you can take any more magic -- we know , we know , that could never happen -- drop by mrs. @entity56 for some warm , gooey cookies			2
and , of course , @entity1			2
@entity60 in @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 if one @entity1 just is n't enough holiday spirit for you , visit @entity63 's @entity62 , where 13 @entity66 or " @entity67 " arrive during the @entity69 season			2

it was created by @entity91 to honor @entity93 's memory and to promote peace and joy -- an important message whatever the season			0

traverse the glittering lochs to admire the rugged landscape			0
enjoy having a designated driver in the conductor after you visit @entity111 , one of @entity99 's oldest sources of single malt scotch whiskey			0
( much fancier than the annual holiday tradition of watching @entity116 get blitzed on @entity117			0
) stop and do some last - minute gift buying during your stop at the @entity121 , where rich tweeds and cashmeres abound			0
once the moon is out , laugh with your fellow passengers over hearty holiday meals while enjoying toe - tappin ' live @entity128 folk music and dancing			0
@entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 if you just ca n't even handle any part of the real world during @entity135 , bundle yourself away in a @entity137 mansion for a weekend of inescapable @entity11 festivities			1
start the getaway off with a proper @entity132 tea , and then sip crisp champagne while being serenaded by the parish choir			0
spend the snowy @entity132 nights curled up by the massive fireplace feasting on mulled wine and mince pies until your satisfied stomach begins to resemble @entity148 's			1
on christmas day , an ornate and jolly @entity11 will pull up in front of the mansion , perched in a @entity152 horse - drawn carriage			1
after all presents have been distributed , sit where @entity1 himself sat as you glide around the estate grounds in the snow			0
christmas in @entity158 , @entity22 , @entity159 step away from patting down the lopsided snowman in your front yard and travel to the @entity22 to combine two of the best parts of the holiday season : ice and @entity11 lights			1

naturally , you 'll want to share your @entity11 spirit with everyone you know to make sure that @entity1 's sleigh will definitely run when it 's stocking time			1
because really , who does n't love throwing up bunny ears beside a giant red and blue polar bear ? once you 've " cheese " ed to your heart 's content , hop on a sled and speed down one of the many neon - lit ice slides			2
@entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 @entity201 rhinestone tutus , massive graceful leaps , rich @entity203 score ... does this sound like heaven to you ? even the most die - hard @entity11 fan might find nod off during a traditional rendition of " @entity209 , " but not so with this festive event			1
enjoy champagne and a complete high tea while watching @entity213 of @entity214 tell the classic @entity11 story , complete with swordfighting as well as stellar dancing			1
jump into the magic and learn to perform an entire scene from the ballet , whether you have two left feet or a background in dance			0
it may be fat sugar plums or it may be your absolutely horrific pirouettes , but something will certainly be dancing in your head after a magical night at the @entity196			2

after a day full of participating in the @entity249 ( ax - throwing , anyone ? ) and dancing around the ice @entity252 , feast on spicy gingerbread , herring and meatballs at the @entity256			2
@entity257 when you ca n't stomach another candy cane and just want to punch @entity1 in his big old belly , try a @entity261 holiday detox getaway			0
