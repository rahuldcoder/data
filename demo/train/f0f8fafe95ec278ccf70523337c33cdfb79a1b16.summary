-- @entity1 is the first to admit that she likes nice things			2
stylist @entity3 has offered his clients bargains and hosted two designers ' shows to help them save money			1
but these days when she passes the new upscale shopping area en route to her @entity10 , @entity11 , office , she refuses to even glance at the lavish goodies			2
" there 's a @entity17 store , a @entity19 store , @entity20 's , " said the attorney and principal of @entity23			2
" i drive by and i do n't even look in that direction			2
" with the economy in shambles and so many people losing their jobs and homes , it is no longer considered cool to brag about possessions and purchases			1
for many during a deepening recession , conspicuous consumption is out and frugality is the new black			1
" people have long used the way they shop and what they buy as a way to communicate with other people about their values , their tastes and their interests , " said @entity38 , a consumer psychologist and professor at @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42			2
" a year ago , what was considered the ultimate status symbol would have been the chicest bag or the most luxurious outfit , " @entity38 added			2
" now what 's chic is being the most knowledgeable and efficient at saving money			1
" @entity38 said that despite the tough economic times , there are many @entity59 who still have disposable income			1
those people are choosing not to spend , she said , or making more thoughtful purchases			1
" what i am saying is that we have moved from an era of conspicuous consumption to an era of considered consumption , " @entity38 said			1
" people at one time wanted to showcase all of the things they are buying and now they are stopping and really thinking about it			0
" @entity74 , co-founder and chief creative officer of @entity76 , is also seeing evidence of that attitude shift			0

" buying the new red @entity92 is certainly not in favor , " @entity74 said			0
" everybody is trying to do things sort of under the radar screen			0
no one is looking to be as ostentatious as they may have been in the past			0
" consumers are looking for value for their spending , @entity74 said , and focusing on " how do you live like a king without having to spend a king 's ransom ? " to that end , @entity74 and his staff are brainstorming ways to address the change in spending habits in their publication			1
" we do n't believe that luxury lifestyle has gone away , " @entity74 said			0
" we 're looking at maybe not having the $ 250,000 watch , but a great watch you can get for perhaps $ 7,500			2
" renowned hairstylist and salon owner @entity3 said he , too , has seen the focus shift to more bang for the buck during the economic downturn			1
@entity3 said clients are opting for money - saving tactics like extending time between visits , partial highlights or getting services on " training nights " for the salon , which can trim their bill up to 60 percent			1
" we are doing everything we can to accommodate the clients , " said @entity3 , whose @entity130 in @entity131 has only seen a slight decrease in business			0
@entity3 is also reaching out to others in the industry who are looking to economize			0

" my massage therapist , my yard person , my hairdresser			0
now people are really stepping back from that and saying ' if i cut my own lawn , i 'm going to have that $ 60 in my pocket			1
' " @entity163 said he has noticed from listeners to his popular call - in radio show that even those who really do n't need to cut back are still choosing to do so			1
that did n't happen , he said , during the last deep recession from 1979 to 1982			2
@entity163 said he attributes the rush to downsize in part to the 24 - hour news cycle , which continues to pepper the public with bad news			1
" people did n't have access to the constant drumbeat of news that they have now , " he said			0
with so much personal spending being tied to emotion , @entity163 said consumers are being much more cautious while they ride out the economic turmoil and are taking comfort in being able to score good deals			1
@entity1 posted unabashedly on @entity197 when she spotted a pair of @entity200 shoes originally priced at $ 180 going for $ 20 at @entity201			2
