-- @entity2 's ambitious plan to offer a @entity4 street level view of communities across three continents hit a snag when angry residents of a @entity10 village blocked the search engine 's camera car from photographing their homes			1
@entity14 , can be seen from the air on @entity16 , but not from the ground			2
fearing the appearance of their well appointed properties on the web site would attract criminals scouting for burglary targets , villagers in @entity14 , north of @entity19 , summoned the police after spotting the car			1
" i was upstairs when i spotted the camera car driving down the lane , " resident @entity27 told @entity28			2
" my immediate reaction was anger : how dare anyone take a photograph of my home without my consent ? i ran outside to flag the car down and told the driver he was not only invading our privacy but also facilitating crime			0
" this is an affluent area			0
we 've already had three burglaries locally in the past six weeks			0
if our houses are plastered all over @entity2 it 's an invitation for more criminals to strike			2
i was determined to make a stand , so i called the police			0
" @entity2 's @entity52 project to map 360 - degree images of roads and homes across the world has generated numerous complaints over privacy , despite automated software that blurs faces and car licence plates			1
a @entity2 spokesman , quoted by the @entity10 @entity63 , said : " embarking on new projects , we sometimes encounter unexpected challenges , and @entity52 has been no exception			1
" we know that some people are uncomfortable with images of their houses or cars being included in the product , which is why we provide an easy way to request removal of imagery			0
most imagery requests are processed within hours			0
" the spokesman added : " we take privacy very seriously , and we were careful to ensure that all images in our @entity52 service abide by @entity10 law			1
