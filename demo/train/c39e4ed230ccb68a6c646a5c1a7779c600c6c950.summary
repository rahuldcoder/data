@entity0 has a different approach to human waste -- he considers it as wealth			1
rather than flush it down the toilet , the 47 - year - old @entity5 farmer collects it to spray on his crops			1
" it 's three times better than chemical fertilizers , " he said , referring to yield of his fruit and vegetable crops after using human fertilizer compared to more conventional methods			1
as he walked across his 27,000 square feet of land in @entity20 on the outskirts of the capital @entity23 , @entity0 said his method of fertilizing is nothing new			0
he described it as an " age - old tradition , " passed down from his parents , though he says the approach is now more efficient and clean			1
taking a few quick steps towards his ecological sanitation -- or ecosan -- toilet , @entity0 explained how it works			0
the urine and feces are stored in separate airtight compartments of the toilet , he said , for later use on the land			1
the urine is kept for about two weeks before it is used , while the feces , which is turned into manure , is used every six months			1
according to @entity48 , a soil scientist at @entity5 's @entity49 , " it is important to secure the urine container for two weeks to a month to reduce the risk from bacteria and other germs			1
" he said that urine can be used safely and the health risk associated with it is generally low			2
@entity48 , however , pointed that users should be careful during source separation at the toilet as fecal cross contamination of urine could increase the health risks			2
" it is best to mix urine with compost for best results , " he added			1
the @entity64 's guidelines for safe use of wastewater , excreta and greywater also underscore a mix of multiple health and safety measures			2
it states : " wastewater treatment plus a withholding period to allow pathogen die - off prior to harvest plus good food hygiene plus cooking of food may be sufficient to reduce health risks adequately			0
" @entity0 , who collects about 100 liters of urine from his family 's toilet each month , said for every liter of urine , he mixes three liters of water and sprays it over his land where he cultivates seasonal vegetables and fruits			1
@entity90 , senior scientist at the @entity93 's ( @entity92 ) @entity91 , said urine was surprisingly rich in nutrients			1
according to @entity90 , a liter of urine contains up to 0.9 % nitrogen , 0.12 % phosphorus and 0.26 % potassium these elements -- collectively known as @entity102 -- helps regulate the plants ' metabolism and contains enough protein for them to grow			2
" a person urinates an average of 550 liters per year , " he said			0
" so this produces some four kilograms of nitrogen , which is equivalent to eight kilograms of nitrogen - rich urea			0
" @entity93 conducted research between 2004 and 2006 in order to ascertain the risks and benefits associated with using urine as fertilizer			2
in separate plots of land , they evaluated the effectiveness of chemical fertilizer and urine			1
while the first year did n't demonstrate a good result , during the second year , the production was equal , @entity90 said			2
but during the third year research , @entity90 said they experimented with urine and compost , which according to him is the best nourishment for plants			1
@entity0 follows the same rule , and the results he said are " clearly visible			0
" " it also enhances the taste and quality of the vegetables , " he said			0
" that 's why when i go to the market to sell , people come to me , and they do n't mind paying a few rupees extra			2
" he said at the market his vegetables are considered organic which helps them fetch a higher price			1
after finding out about the agricultural application of urine in @entity0 's farm , his neighbors followed his lead			1
@entity151 , who lives a few houses away from @entity0 , said he discovered this aspect of urine six years ago and has been using it since			2
his family has also invested in an ecosan toilet to make the process easier			0
" we do n't use any chemical fertilizers now , " said the 24 - year - old business student , who also dedicates his time on his family farm			0
" the result , as you see , is distinct , " he said pointing toward the garlic shoots in his garden			0
in their village of @entity170 , 100 of the 1,300 households use ecosan toilets , the by - product of which are directly used for agricultural purposes			0
the @entity175 and @entity176 was one of the first to initiate this project , along with other partners , in 2003 , has now expanded to more than 3,000 households across @entity5			1
@entity181 , executive director of @entity182 , said the growing links between sanitation and agriculture are encouraging			0
speaking at a workshop organized to promote ecological sanitation , he said that the steps farmers are taking is " a [ positive ] shift toward an organic culture			0
" banking on the importance of urine , about 93 miles ( 150 kilometers ) away from @entity23 , in @entity195 district , users like @entity193 are taking on the role of promoters			0
in his village of @entity203 , the school headmaster started the concept from his house in 2006			0
soon he was able to convince his neighbors as well as five schools to install ecosan toilets and couple cleanliness with cultivation			0
" the children are learning about sanitation and the purpose of urine in farming and their families are implementing it and getting good results , " he said			0
for people like @entity0 and @entity220 , along with other farmers who have traded urine for urea , it has opened up new possibilities -- the production is high and there 's no cost associated			1
" people have started realizing the value of urine , " @entity0 said			0
" it can do wonders in the farm , and it 's absolutely free			1

growing numbers of farmers in @entity5 are using human waste on crops
it 's a free and efficient way to boost production and yield sells for higher price
special toilets separate the urine and feces and with compost they *'re* used on crops
