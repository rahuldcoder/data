@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 government is vowing to fight a @entity5 court ruling that crucifixes in classrooms violate students ' right to freedom of religion			1
the @entity11 found unanimously tuesday that the display of a particular religious symbol -- such as the @entity22 cross -- in a classroom " restricted the right of parents to educate their children in conformity with their convictions , and the right of children to believe or not to believe , " a court statement said			1
the case was brought by an @entity1 woman , @entity25 , who objected to the crucifixes on the walls in her two sons ' classrooms			1
@entity1 courts had ruled earlier that the cross was a symbol of @entity1 's history and culture , prompting @entity25 to take her case to the @entity5 court in @entity36 , @entity37			1
it awarded her 5,000 euros ( $ 7,400 ) in damages tuesday			0
the @entity1 government said it would appeal the @entity11 's verdict and leading @entity42 figures expressed astonishment and anger			1
the ruling " is cause for bitterness and many perplexities , " the @entity45 of @entity46 said in a written statement			0
the bishops said they were still studying the ruling , but it appeared to result from " ideological bias " and a lack of understanding of " the multiple significances of the crucifix			0
" " it does not take into account the fact that in @entity1 the display of the crucifix in public places is in line with the recognition of the principles of the @entity42 as ' part of the historical patrimony of the @entity1 people , ' as stated in the @entity73 / @entity1 agreement of 1984 , " the bishops said			1
the @entity73 in @entity0 , which has been the seat of the @entity75 for most of its 2,000 - year history , did not officially respond to the ruling			2
but cardinal @entity78 told the leading @entity1 daily @entity79 he could not understand it , and that no one with common sense could have expected it			2
" when i think that we are talking about a symbol , the crucifix , an image that can not but be the emblem of a universally shared humanity , i not only feel disappointed but also sadness and grief , " he said			0
" the crucifix is the sign of a @entity91 that loves man to the point of giving up his life for him			0
it is a @entity91 that teaches us to learn to love , to pay attention to each man ... and to respect the others , even those who belong to a different culture or religion			0
" how could someone not share such a symbol ? " @entity1 has three months to file a request for a new hearing , court spokesman @entity106 told @entity2			2
a five - judge panel will examine the request , officially known as a referral , to determine if it raises sufficiently important issues for a 17 - judge @entity11 hearing			2
only the @entity1 government can appeal the verdict , but other interested parties can file briefs if the case goes forward , @entity106 said			1
the @entity11 was set up in @entity36 by the @entity122 member @entity120 in 1959 to deal with alleged violations of the 1950 @entity124			0
@entity2 's @entity125 in @entity0 contributed to this report .			0
