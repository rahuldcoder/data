@entity0 -- the @entity2 has released approximately 1,800 pages of documents that shed more light on the @entity6			1
the documents indicate that the @entity7 violated its own internal guidelines relating to phone numbers it can " query " from among records the agency collects			1
moreover , the documents indicate that the @entity7 presented false information to the surveillance court about the violation			1
" the people responsible for authoring the report did not fully understand how the operation was working , " a senior intelligence official said			0
" that misrepresentation resulted in a factually inaccurate report			0
" opinion : what the government is hiding from you the documents satisfy a judge 's order pertaining to public records requests from the @entity29 and the @entity30 , a privacy advocacy group , about @entity6 interpretations of the section of the @entity33 dealing with collecting metadata , the so - called business records provision			1
the metadata program started in 2006 and allowed the @entity7 to seek to obtain more information about a number if there was " reasonable articulable suspicion " that the number was linked to terrorism			1
the @entity7 also kept a separate " alert list " that was used to compare the new numbers that were coming in daily and consider whether new numbers should be added to the category of those with " reasonable articulable suspicion			2
" the alert list started with about 4,000 numbers and ended up with 17,835 , most of which did not have the required suspicion , officials say			0
the court ruled that the @entity7 was allowed to have the alert list , but the agency could not run it against the larger database because it did not have the reasonable suspicion			1
every day , phone companies sent metadata , which went into an archive			0
but each day , the @entity7 ran the alert list against the new information to see if it could establish reasonable suspicion			2
this went on from may 2006 until january 2009			0
" to further complicate matters , " an official said , " reporting to the court , we described the alert list but did not describe ( it ) accurately			0
" @entity7 misrepresented scope of data collection to secret court senior intelligence officials attempted to assure reporters that the news was not so much the compliance violation , but the fact that the @entity7 uncovered the problem , reported it to the @entity79 and the @entity6 , " took steps thereafter to do a thorough scrub of operations , " and reported back to the @entity6 after the changes had been made			1
in one declassified order from march 2009 , judge @entity84 said the court would " not permit the government to access the data collected until such time as the government is able to restore the court 's confidence that the government can and will comply with previously approved procedures for accessing such data			2
" a senior intelligence official noted " fairly strong language " by the court , but stressed that it did not find any " intentional attempt " to violate the law or abuse the program			0
because there was such confusion about the program , the @entity7 instituted new steps to guard against future violations , including adding a compliance director , the officials said			0
reports : @entity7 has cracked much online encryption one official said this proved that there was " effective oversight by the executive branch and the court			2
@entity7 is not perfect and screws up from time to time			0
" but there never has been any indication that these programs have been abused by spying for improper purposes or exceeding guidelines with improper authority , he said			0
the officials said they did not know of any @entity7 employee who was punished or fired as a result of the problem			0
director of national intelligence @entity130 said in a statement that the incidents were promptly reported to the court , which ordered @entity7 to seek its approval to query metadata on a case - by - case basis , except when lives were under imminent threat			1
" the documents released today are a testament to the government 's strong commitment to detecting , correcting , and reporting mistakes that occur in implementing technologically complex intelligence collection activities , and to continually improving its oversight and compliance processes , " he said			2
court renews secret @entity151 surveillance program the @entity29 said the documents confirm that the agency " can not be trusted " with such sweeping powers and that the " secret and one - sided " judicial review is not an adequate check			1
" the abuses revealed in these documents are alarming but also predictable			0
these violations are the inevitable result of allowing the @entity7 to assemble a vast database of sensitive information about every @entity151 , " @entity157 , staff attorney with the @entity158 , said in a statement			2
the civil liberties group has challenged the constitutionality of the @entity7 phone records collection program in court			1
internet companies fight to release more information on @entity7 requests			1

newly released documents show the @entity7 violated phone - records rules
papers : @entity7 also submitted *incorrect* information to the @entity6
the papers were released to comply with @entity29 , @entity30 requests
the court required the @entity7 to seek approval to query data until processes were improved
