@entity0 -- @entity2 , the company that owns the crippled @entity4 nuclear power plant , said tuesday it is going to stick to its previously announced timetable of six to nine months in bringing an end to the crisis			1
but the company says it will have to change strategies in cooling the no. 1 reactor after it learned last week that water levels in the reactor were much lower than previously believed			1
@entity2 first laid out the six to nine month timetable for bringing an end to the crisis in mid-april			1
but the company said last week that the water levels in the no. 1 reactor were much lower than previously believed , and that it suspects the fuel rods had melted and fallen into the coolant at the base of the reactor pressure vessel			1
the company also said it suspects that the pressure vessel was leaking fluid into the surrounding concrete containment vessel			2
it was not clear where the leak was located or how bad it was , but the discovery could complicate efforts to restore normal cooling systems in the reactor			1
three reactors at @entity4 overheated after the plant was struck by the march 11 earthquake and tsunami , which knocked out the units ' cooling systems and unleashed the worst nuclear disaster since @entity37			1
over the weekend , residents began evacuating from two villages which had originally been outside the danger zone drawn around the plant			2
the towns of @entity44 and @entity45 were downwind of the plant in the early days of the disaster , and radiation levels there are high enough to raise the long - term risk of cancer for those remaining , the government said			2
" i know that they are having to endure great hardships , and their life in evacuation going forward will be a very harsh one , " chief cabinet secretary @entity53 told reporters monday			0
" we truly regret that this had to happen			0
" radiation levels in @entity44 , about 40 km northwest of the plant , were nearly 40 times normal background levels monday , according to data released by the country 's @entity65			0
someone who spent eight hours a day outside would get the government 's maximum allowable dose of 20 millisieverts in about six months at those levels			0
residents of those towns and all or part of three others were given orders to start packing in april			0
five more areas have been put on notice to await evacuation orders , and the government says it will decide whether those residents will be allowed to return around the time the crisis is resolved			0
