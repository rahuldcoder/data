-- on the same day terrorists took lives in @entity4 , secretary of state @entity1 talked in @entity5 about another young life extinguished by an explosive device , foreign service officer @entity8			1
" a 25 - year - old young woman , full of idealism , full of hopes , taking books to children in a school so they can learn , and wiped out by terrorism , by the worst kind of nihilistic nothing -- violence that does n't stand for anything except killing people and stopping the future , " @entity1 said , talking of his decision to pay a condolence visit to her parents and vowing her death would not be in vain			1
" we 're not going to be deterred			2
we 're going to be inspired			0
and we 're going to use @entity8 's idealism as another motivation for the idealism that brings all of you to this effort in the first place			0
we can make this world better			2
" only hours later came @entity4 , and more lives blown apart by explosive devices planted to deadly effect on a day that should have been a holiday			1
bombs hit innocents right in the heart of a street celebration and were timed for the most lethal impact			0
an 8 - year - old boy , who had held a handmade sign calling for peace , dead			0
a young @entity4 woman full of promise extinguished before her 30th birthday			1
a young @entity54 woman who chased her dream of education in @entity4 killed			1
death clinging to the streets in a city that would have found the idea unthinkable even moments before			0
@entity62 will be called upon in the coming days to do as so many families have before them : to pull themselves out of the swamp of their heartbreak and to push forward with life			0
to make certain that those who practice destruction and devastation do not achieve a win			0
to find the valor amid the annihilation and to force resilience to rise up against grief			2
as @entity1 said , to be inspired by horror to " make this world better , " as @entity4 's first responders and a slew of marathon volunteers surely were			1
but it will not be easy			0
facing down terror and resuming life is tough			0
rebuilding after loss requires a particular kind of tenacity and a commitment to living that grief wants to smother			1
many push forward to do honor to the memory of those they have lost			0
but they must remind themselves each step of the way that though it would be easier to succumb to loss they must instead choose life			2
because otherwise their loved one 's example would be in vain			0
as @entity4 struggled to reconcile itself with the re-emergence of terror , a series of bombs exploded across @entity104 leaving death and maiming behind			1
people simply trying to make a flight at @entity109 's airport died when parked cars became explosives			1
at least 42 were killed across the country			2
