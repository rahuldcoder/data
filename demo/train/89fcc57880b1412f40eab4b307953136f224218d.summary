analysts : ' the ship of state always leaks , ' but damage is less certain " these two highly respected and experienced prosecutors will be directing separate investigations currently being conducted by the @entity28			2
i have every confidence in their abilities to doggedly follow the facts and the evidence in the pursuit of justice wherever it leads , " said @entity1			1
earlier friday , president @entity36 strongly rejected claims that his @entity38 has deliberately leaked secrets to the media , saying the idea was " offensive " and would put @entity3 at risk			1
some @entity20 , led by veteran sen. @entity43 of @entity44 , alleged that the @entity38 must be knowingly involved because of the nature of the leaked information			1
but @entity36 pushed back angrily as he was questioned on the issue at a news conference , saying that he had " zero tolerance " for such leaks and that those responsible would " suffer consequences			1
" " the notion that the @entity38 would purposely release classified national security information is offensive , it 's wrong , and people , i think , need to have a better sense of how i approach this office and how the people around me approach this office , " he said			1
" we are dealing with issues that can touch on the safety and security of the @entity3 people -- our families or our military or our allies -- and so we do n't play with that			0

" in response , @entity43 said @entity36 was distancing himself from the controversy			1
" what the president did not unequivocally say today is that none of the classified or highly sensitive information recently leaked to the media came from the @entity38 , " @entity43 said			1
" i continue to call on the president to immediately appoint a special counsel to fully investigate and , where necessary , prosecute these gravely serious breaches of our national security			0
" a report in the @entity89 last week that provided classified details of what it described as a @entity3 cyberattack targeting @entity95 's nuclear centrifuge program sparked the bipartisan outrage			0
@entity36 also repeated the statements made by the writers of the articles in question that the @entity38 was not the source of their information			1
other recent possible leaks of classified information included details on the administration 's efforts to expand its drone program and @entity36 's involvement in " kill lists " against militants in @entity112 and @entity113			1
the public airing of details surrounding a recently disrupted bomb plot in @entity112 by @entity117 also angered intelligence and national security officials			0
congressional leaders said earlier friday that those responsible for endangering national security by leaking classified information to the media should be sent to jail			1
@entity125 rep. @entity125 of @entity126 , the @entity128 chairman , said that it was not yet known who was behind the leaks but that someone " committed a crime that is having serious consequences to our national security			0
" bipartisan efforts are needed to identify whoever is responsible for the leaks , involving a cyberwarfare program against @entity95 and other intelligence matters , and " make sure that leaker goes to jail , " he said			0
rep. @entity144 of @entity145 , the top @entity146 on the @entity38 panel , echoed @entity125 ' call for the leaker to be " held accountable			2
" speaking in the @entity38 on friday , @entity20 rep. @entity20 of @entity150 asked , " where is the outrage from the @entity38 about these leaks ? " he called for the @entity38 " to get off the campaign trail , show leadership , do the president 's job and aggressively pursue the leakers of @entity3 's state secrets			2
" leaks not only compromise national security efforts , they discourage allies from trusting in the @entity3 , @entity20 said			0
" it 's time for the president to plug the holes and protect @entity3 's national security , " he said			0
@entity125 said friday that the recent leaks are " a hundred times the magnitude " of those in the @entity170 case and that " someone needs to pay a price for this crime			0
" former vice president @entity175 's chief of staff , @entity174 , was convicted in 2007 in connection with the leaking of @entity179 officer @entity170 's identity -- information that was technically classified , though @entity175 later implied that information had been declassified			2
@entity144 said it was vital that bipartisan efforts were made to " follow the facts wherever they go " but reiterated that the source of the information was not known			2
" these leaks have been occurring more and more , " he said , adding that they were the worst he had seen in nearly 10 years on the intelligence panel			0
the leaks could come from within @entity192 or the executive branch , he acknowledged			0
the @entity128 leaders met thursday with fbi director @entity195 , whose agency is investigating the leaks , according to legislators			0
specifically , the @entity28 has launched an investigation into apparent leaks of classified information involving the cyberwarfare program against @entity95 , a @entity3 official said this week			1
the agency is also investigating the thwarted @entity112 plot , according to @entity195			0
in its report , the @entity89 said that since shortly after he became president , @entity36 has ordered cyberattacks targeting computers that run @entity95 's nuclear enrichment facilities			2
it attributed the information to participants in the program			0
@entity43 , the ranking @entity20 on the @entity214 , alleged that the @entity38 authorized the leaks for political gain			1
" these leaks clearly were not done in the interest of national security or to reveal corrupt or illegal actions about which the public has a right to know , as in the case of legitimate whistleblowers , " @entity43 said			2
" it is difficult to escape the conclusion that these recent leaks of highly classified information , all of which have the effect of making the president look strong and decisive on national security in the middle of his re-election campaign , have a deeper political motivation			1
" the @entity38 pushed back , with spokesman @entity237 saying that " this administration takes all appropriate and necessary steps to prevent leaks of classified information or sensitive information that could risk ongoing counterterrorism or intelligence operations			1
" @entity0 's @entity245 contriobuted to this report .			0
