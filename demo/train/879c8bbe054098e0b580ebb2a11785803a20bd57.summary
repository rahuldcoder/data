-- following the @entity2 's announcement that radio frequency emissions from cell phones may increase the risk of some kinds of brain cancer , what do you need to know about the radiation coming from your phone ? how can you protect yourself ? and should @entity13 emission information be listed on cell phone packaging , and in stores ? first things first : the @entity2 study did not say " cell phones cause brain cancer			1
" rather , there is some evidence indicating a possible connection -- and while not conclusive , it warrants further study			0
consequently , @entity2 has now categorized radio frequency electromagnetic fields as a " group @entity25 " possible human carcinogen			1
here 's how @entity27 , head of health information at @entity29 , explained it in his detailed analysis of the @entity2 announcement : " @entity25 means that there is some evidence for a risk but it 's not that convincing			2
this group ends up being a bit of a catch - all category , and includes everything from carpentry to chloroform			1
" dr. @entity45 : cell phones , brain tumors so it 's worth being aware of this classification -- just as you should be mindful of your intake of coffee , another group @entity25 carcinogen			1
but this announcement is not a reason to panic			0
would labels help ? @entity57 has been wrestling with whether to require cell phones to be labeled for their @entity13 emissions			1
last year , the city tried to mandate cell phone radiation labeling in stores , originally to take effect february 2011			2
but according to the @entity65 , " implementation was delayed until may 1 , then june 15			0
there now is no proposed start date			0
" the city backtracked on this partly out of concern over a lawsuit filed by the @entity72 -- but also because officials did n't know how to ensure the accuracy of the labels			0
scientists are n't sure what 's the most realistic , intuitive way to communicate cell phone @entity13 emissions to consumers			1
specific absorption rate , a measure of the rate of @entity13 energy that your body absorbs from the phone , is the most commonly cited benchmark			1
for a phone to be certified by the @entity94 and sold in the @entity95 , for example , its maximum @entity91 level must be less than 1.6 watts per kilogram			0
but @entity96 , director of the @entity97 and @entity98 at @entity99 , told the @entity65 that " specific absorption rate is n't a very useful measure because it 's the peak reading on a variety of tests conducted on cell phones to measure their radiation , but does n't indicate the average amount of radiation a user would generally be exposed to			1
" he likened it to a car 's gas mileage being reported only based on driving it up a steep hill			0
such a measurement could actually make a car shopper avoid a hybrid because it does n't perform well on hills , even though it would generally consume less gas			0
@entity119 recently updated its guide to cell phone radiation levels , which ranks phones according to @entity91			2
cell phones and radiation : the 10 highest - and lowest - emitting models what cell phone users can do if you are concerned that cell phones might increase your cancer risk , probably the best way to put the @entity2 announcement to good use is to minimize how much you hold your cell phone next to your head			1
more tips on minimizing cell phone radiation your best bet is to use a headset that physically plugs in to your phone , such as earbuds with a microphone attached			2
unlike @entity144 headsets , this entails no additional @entity13 exposure near your head -- although it may take a moment to connect your headset to your phone			2
while the @entity2 examined only the possible risk of brain cancer , you can further reduce your cell phone @entity13 exposure by placing your phone a few inches away from your body while using it -- such as in a purse or on the table			1
or whenever possible , talk via your phone 's speaker function , or send a text message instead of placing a call			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162 .			0

who classifies radio frequency electromagnetic fields as a " group @entity25 " possible carcinogen
group is catch - all category , and includes everything from carpentry to chloroform
scientists are n't sure how to communicate cell phone @entity13 emissions to consumers
specific absorption rate is the most commonly cited benchmark
