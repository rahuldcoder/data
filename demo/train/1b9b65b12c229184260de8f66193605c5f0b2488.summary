-- as @entity2 struggles to come to terms with its greatest loss of life in decades , all eyes are on the man charged in the explosion in central @entity9 and the deadly shooting rampage at a youth camp			1
while police have not officially named him , @entity2 television and newspaper reports have identified the suspect as 32 - year - old @entity18 , of @entity2 origin			1
a picture is emerging , gleaned from official sources and social media , of a right - wing @entity24 fundamentalist who may have had an issue with @entity2 's multi-cultural society			1
@entity2 and international news outlets have run photographs of a blond man with blue - green eyes and chiseled features , dressed in a preppy style			1
a victim who was shot during the attack at the youth camp on @entity37 told @entity0 saturday that he had seen pictures of @entity18 taken from what is believed to be his @entity41 page and shown on @entity42 and @entity43			1
the victim said he recognized the man from the news reports as the gunman			2
@entity18 is a member of the @entity48 and has three weapons registered in his name , according to leading @entity2 newspaper @entity51 , citing @entity2 's official weapons register			1
they are a glock pistol , a rifle and a shotgun , @entity51 reported			0
@entity42 reports that @entity18 does not have a military background and was exempt from @entity2 's mandatory military service			1
he has not had any special military training , it adds on its website			0
he was a youth and adult member of the conservative @entity61 ( @entity61 ) or @entity61 , @entity51 newspaper reports , remaining involved until 2007			1
the party 's most prominent manifesto pledge is to minimize immigration			2
his membership was confirmed by a senior party member , @entity67 , who is quoted by @entity51 as saying that encountering @entity18 was " like meeting @entity68 before @entity69 " the leader of the @entity61 , @entity70 , told @entity2 broadcaster @entity71 she was " horrified " to learn that the suspect was a former member of her party			1
" but this is first and foremost an attack against the entire nation			0
it has affected all of us , " she said , saying that her party members stood in solidarity with the youth movement of the @entity81			2
a post in @entity18 's name on an online forum , @entity87 , from december 2009 , talks about @entity89 teenagers being " in an especially precarious situation with regards to being harassed by @entity93 youth			1
" " i know of many hundred occasions where non-muslims have been robbed , beaten up and harassed by @entity93 gangs , " the post reads			0
" i had a best friend between the ages of 12 - 17 who was a @entity101 , so i was one of the many protected , cool ' potatoes ' that had protection			2
but this also made me see the hypocrisy up close and personal and made me nauseous			0
" such @entity107 sentiment is nothing new in @entity2 or other @entity110 nations , where there has been resistance against increasing numbers of @entity114 and their practices			2
about 3 % of @entity2 's population in 2010 -- 144,000 people -- were @entity114 , but that was expected to more than double to 6.5 % over the next 20 years , according to a report released earlier this year by @entity121			2
that is one of the largest percentage increases in @entity114 populations across all of @entity110 , thanks in part to fertility rates significantly higher than those of non-muslims			2
another post in @entity18 's name in october 2009 advises " @entity134 " , described as the founder of @entity87 , to " develop an alternative to the violent extreme @entity2 @entity138 organisations @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 " -- all left - wing movements in @entity2			1
" the conservatives dare not openly express their viewpoints in public because they know that the extreme @entity146 will trump them			0
we can not accept the fact that the @entity81 is subsidising these violent " @entity150 jugend " , who are systematically terrorising the politically conservative , " the post reads			0
he is making a reference to the youth movement of prime minister @entity150 , who heads the @entity81			0
a @entity156 account attributed to @entity18 by @entity2 newspaper @entity157 has only one message , dated july 17			2
" one person with a belief is equal to the force of 100,000 who has only interests , " it says , adapting a quote from 19th - century @entity162 philosopher @entity161 police have not ruled out the possibility that other people may have helped the suspect			2
" the official questioning is starting now , " @entity172 , a police official , told reporters during a news conference saturday			0
the suspect was cooperating with police , making it clear he wanted to explain himself , @entity172 said			0
@entity2 's police website said the suspect is currently charged with breaking paragraph 147a of the penal code -- a terrorism offense , with a maximum sentence of 21 years			1
the statement said he was charged in both the @entity37 attack and the bombing of government buildings in @entity9 , and that the charges might change			1
" the suspect has never been arrested by the police before , " it said			0
two addresses connected to the suspect are being searched , police said			1
one of them is believed to be an apartment in @entity9 and the other a farm in @entity202			1
@entity42 reports that @entity18 is registered as having run a company that produced " vegetables , melons , roots and tubers " -- an industry which allows access to large amounts of fertilizer , the broadcaster notes , which can be used for explosives			1
an employee at a @entity2 agricultural cooperative told @entity0 that the man identified in media reports as the suspect in friday 's attacks bought six tons of fertilizer from her company in may			1
@entity221 , of @entity222 , said she did not think the order was strange at the time because the suspect has a farm , but after the @entity9 attack she called police because she knew the material can be used to make bombs			1
" we are very shocked that this man was connected to our company , " said @entity221			2
" we are very sad about what happened			0
" more details on the man are sure to emerge in the coming hours and days			0
but what many @entity2 find hard to comprehend is that the chief suspect in the massacre appears to be one of their own			0
@entity150 stressed that whoever was behind the attacks must be dealt with properly			0
" it is very important that those who are responsible -- one or several persons -- are sentenced according to @entity2 law , in the @entity2 system of justice , " he said			0
" @entity2 is a small country but it is a proud country			0
we are all very close , especially in times like this			0
" @entity0 's @entity253 and @entity254 contributed to this report .			0
