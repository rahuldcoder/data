@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 kept two boxes he bought at a garage sale under his pool table for four years before realizing they may be too valuable to store at home			1
the @entity10 , @entity1 , commercial painter learned this week that what was in those boxes he paid $ 45 dollars for a decade ago could be worth more than $ 200 million			1
" when i heard that $ 200 million , i got a little weak , " @entity3 said at a @entity14 art gallery tuesday			0
art , forensic , handwriting and weather experts teamed up to conclude the 65 glass plates in the boxes were photographic negatives created more than 80 years ago by @entity22 , the iconic @entity23 photographer whose images of the @entity25 inspired the country			1
@entity27 , the lawyer who led the effort to authenticate that the negatives were made by the man known as the father of @entity23 photography , said their approach was " to put these negatives on trial			1
" experts , including a former @entity44 agent and a @entity23 attorney , " came to the conclusion that , based on the evidence which was overwhelming , that no reasonable person would have any doubt that these , in fact , were the long - lost images of @entity22 , " @entity27 said			1
the photographs were from the early career of the famed nature photographer , a period that is not well documented since a 1937 darkroom fire destroyed 5,000 of his plates , @entity27 said			2
" it truly is a missing link of @entity22 and history and his career , " said @entity14 appraiser and art dealer @entity55			1
the photographs were taken between 1919 and the early 1930s at locations familiar to @entity22 , mostly around @entity62 , @entity1 , @entity59 said			1
" this is going to show the world the evolution of his eye , of his talent , of his skill , his gift , but also his legacy , " @entity55 said			0
" and it 's a portion that we thought had been destroyed in the studio fire			0
" @entity3 , who scours garage sales for antiques , was looking for a barber chair when he spotted to two deteriorated boxes in the spring of 2000			0
" when i pulled on of those glass negatives out , i seen @entity62 , " he said			2
" as a young man , i worked at @entity62 quite a bit			0
so , right away i recognized it as @entity62			0
" he bickered with the seller , finally negotiating down from $ 70 to $ 45 for the boxes			1
the owner said he bought them in the 1940s at a warehouse salvage in @entity0			0
he bickered the price down from $ 70 to $ 45			1
it would be two years before he realized they photos may be from @entity22 , he said			1
after four years , he had done enough research to realize the plates could be valuable			2
he moved them from under his pool table and placed them in a bank vault			1
how these 6.5 x 8.5 inch glass plate negatives of famous @entity62 landscapes and @entity101 landmarks -- some of them with fire damage -- made their way from @entity22 collection 70 years ago to a @entity1 garage sale in 2000 can only be guessed			1
photography expert @entity106 , who helped confirm the authenticity of the negatives , suspects @entity22 carried them to use in a photography class he was teaching in @entity111 , @entity1 , in the early 1940s			1
" it is my belief that he brought these negatives with him for teaching purposes and to show students how to not let their negatives be engulfed in a fire , " @entity106 said			0
" i think this clearly explains the range of work in these negatives , from very early pictorialist boat pictures , to images not as successful , to images of the highest level of his work during this time period			0
" @entity106 said it is impossible to know why @entity22 would store them in @entity111 and never reclaim them			2
the plates were individually wrapped in newspaper inside deteriorating manila envelopes			0
notations on each envelope appeared to have been made by @entity137 , the photographer 's wife , according to handwriting experts @entity139 and @entity141			2
they compared them to samples provided by the @entity22 ' grandson			2
while most of the negatives appear never to have been printed , several are nearly identical to well - known @entity22 prints , the experts said			1
meteorologist @entity150 studied clouds and snow cover in a @entity153 negative to conclude that it was taken at about the same time as a known @entity22 photo of a @entity62 tree			2
in addition to @entity62 -- the @entity1 wilderness that @entity22 helped conserve -- the negatives depict @entity1 's @entity167 , views of a rocky point in @entity159 , @entity101 's @entity160 , a sailing yacht at sea and an image of sand dunes			1
" the fact that these locations were well - known to @entity22 , and visited by him , further supports the proposition that all of the images in the collection were most probably created by @entity22 , " said art expert @entity168			2
@entity168 said that after six months of study , he concluded " with a high degree of probability , that the images under consideration were produced by @entity22			1
silver tarnishing on the negatives also helped date the plates to around the 1920s , @entity106 said			0
" i have sent people to prison for the rest of their lives for far less evidence than i have seen in this case , " said evidence and burden of proof expert @entity186 , who was hired by @entity3 to help authenticate them			0
" in my view , those photographs were done by @entity22			0
" @entity27 , the lawyer , said they presented their evidence to descendants of @entity22 , but they 've not heard back			0
@entity3 , who is 64 , still works for the @entity10 school system , but he may retire this year			0
it could be a while before he sees the profits from the sale of prints from the negatives , but @entity59 estimates over the next 25 years it could mean over $ 200 million for @entity3			1
for now , the photos will go on a tour of universities and museums , starting in october at @entity210 , @entity3 said , " i just hope everybody enjoys them , " he said			0
he 's not spoken with the man who sold him the two boxes a decade ago			0
" if he 's still around , i 'm afraid he may come looking for me , " he said .			0
