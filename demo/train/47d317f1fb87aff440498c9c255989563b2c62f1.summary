-- at least 10 people died saturday after @entity4 security forces opened fire on protesters who turned out across the country to mourn dozens of demonstrators slain the day before , eyewitnesses told @entity0			1
the violence erupted in the @entity11 suburb of @entity12 and the southern town of @entity14 , where people attended funerals and buried people shot dead during the " @entity19 " protests			1
the brazen friday killings rippled through the @entity4 political establishment saturday when @entity4 parliament member , @entity22 , announced his resignation in a television interview over the deaths			1
he said security forces opened fire even though president @entity28 promised not to use force against protesters			2
the developments occurred amid growing discontent in @entity4 with the @entity28 regime , whose tough response to peaceful protests has emboldened the citizenry to take to the streets			1
@entity12 is one of the towns where @entity4 have staged anti-government demonstrations for weeks			1
on saturday , as thousands of people marched from the burial grounds towards the main hospital , security forces on the rooftops of government buildings fired shots , a witness said			1
" we were chanting ' with our bloods with our souls we will sacrifice for you martyrs			2
' and all of sudden and without warning , they fired indiscriminately into the crowd , " the witness said			2
the witness said five were killed and others were injured			2
people fled the violence , but several hundred demonstrators remain in smaller alleyways and side streets awaiting the opportunity to come out and demonstrate again			2
activist @entity63 , who is not in @entity4 but remains in contact with activists across the country , said he was told the forces were firing in the air and at random targets			1
his contacts told him more than 10,000 protesters took to the streets			2
witnesses in @entity14 said tens of thousands of people gathered for a funeral procession , when , one witness said , " suddenly they opened fire on us and it was raining bullets			1
we were chanting ' peacefully , peacefully ' and they fired at us			0
" two people were critically wounded in the assault and medical personnel transported them to a hospital in nearby @entity87 , a doctor said			0
there was a confrontation between security forces and families of the victims			0
shots were fired in the air but the security forces left the scene and there were no casualties			2
@entity63 said there were reports of shootings in the city of @entity103 , but an eyewitness said the city is eerily quiet and many people are too scared to leave their homes			1
there were burials of slain protesters but the funeral ceremonies were performed quickly and they were sparsely attended as if to not attract attention , the witness said			0
as for friday 's killings , they occurred in several flashpoint regions as thousands of @entity4 protesters defiantly marched after @entity119 ' weekly prayers in a display of mass discontent toward the government			1
@entity123 ripped through the @entity11 suburbs of @entity12 , @entity125 and @entity126 , and other cities -- @entity103 , @entity128 and @entity14			1
firm casualty figures were difficult to come by			0
the @entity4 government does not permit @entity0 to report from inside the country and @entity0 bases its figures on reports from witnesses			1
@entity63 said activists have confirmed at least 84 deaths from friday 's confrontations between protesters and security forces			2
the state - run @entity140 said a " group of people , some of them armed " assaulted guards in @entity14 on friday , leading to the deaths of eight and the wounding of 28 , both from the group and the military			1
@entity150 , a former @entity151 ambassador to @entity4 , expressed admiration for the demonstrators ' courage , but made no predictions about where it might lead			1
" unfortunately , repression , if used repeatedly , ruthlessly , brutally , can work			0
we saw that in @entity161 and , i 'm afraid , we could see it in @entity4 , " he told @entity0 's " @entity164			1
" the demonstrators do not have the critical mass needed to effect regime change , @entity150 said			0
he noted that massive demonstrations have yet to appear in @entity11 or @entity169 , where millions of people reside , most of them @entity171			0
@entity174 is @entity175 , an offshoot of @entity177			0
the @entity175 sect is a minority in @entity4 but it has maintained control of the regime for decades			1
" there 's a coalition of interests here , and the demonstrations would have to get much , much larger and stretch the capacity of the regime 's security services to the point where some people thought about maybe making their own ways and abandoning @entity28			0
" @entity192 , which reported at least 75 deaths on friday , said two boys aged 7 and 10 and a 70 - year - old man were killed and urged the regime to stop its attacks on " peaceful protesters			1
" " the @entity4 authorities have again responded to peaceful calls for change with bullets and batons , " said @entity198 , @entity192 's @entity199 and @entity201 director			1
the protests began last month in the southern city of @entity87 after a violent crackdown by security forces on peaceful demonstrators protesting the arrests of youths who scribbled anti-government graffiti			0
the tough crackdown in @entity87 spurred more protest			0
as peaceful demonstrations spread to other regions , such as @entity220 , @entity221 , and the @entity11 suburbs , the protests were met with force that emboldened the protesters ' resolve			0
the government made some efforts at reform , include the lifting of the country 's emergency law , the abolition of a special court that tried regime opponents , the establishment of a new cabinet , and the granting of citizenship to stateless people in the country 's northeastern @entity241 region			0
the emergency law permitted the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes			0
the security court was a special body that prosecuted people regarded as challenging the government			0
but activists think the violent crackdown friday undermines the lifting of the emergency law			2
they also have other complaints with the government , such as immunity for its security officers and the incarceration of political prisoners and those arrested for participating in peaceful protests			0
they want the easing of the ruling @entity261 's power and a law that would permit the establishment of independent political parties			0
@entity0 's @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity268 contributed to this report			0

new : witnesses say 10 are killed in @entity12 and @entity14
@entity103 is eerily quiet but shots have been reported there
