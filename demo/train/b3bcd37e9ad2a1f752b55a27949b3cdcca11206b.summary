@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was a 23 - year - old computer science student when his girlfriend 's roommate , @entity6 , was found dead in the house she shared with @entity8 in @entity0 , @entity1 , four years ago			1
the discovery proved to be the beginning of what he calls " a nightmare			2
" he and @entity15 were detained for questioning days later , and charged with murder the following summer			1
in december 2009 , they were convicted , though lawyers for both suggested the crime was carried out solely by a third man , @entity6 , who was convicted in a separate trial			1
there 's dispute about the evidence linking him to the murder			2
prosecutors say his dna was found on a bra clasp belonging to @entity31 , while the defense says there is too little genetic material for a positive @entity35 and that the clasp could have been contaminated by police handling			2
his alibi proved impossible to verify -- he says he was at home on the night of the killing , but his computer showed no activity during the time @entity31 was killed			1
in the end , the jury sided with the prosecutors , sentencing him to 25 years in prison for the murder and related crimes			1
( @entity15 got an extra year because she was also found guilty of defaming bar owner @entity6 by accusing him of the killing			1
) it was not the result @entity3 was expecting			1
" when the sentencing was read , i did n't understand what was happening and even now it seems impossible and still i do n't understand why i was convicted , " he said in a prison interview through his lawyer the week after the sentencing			2
he continues to believe he has a future outside prison , he said			2
" otherwise , i would go insane			0
i think especially about studying and obtaining a post-graduate degree , " he said			0
he has finished his computer science degree in prison , according to press reports			1
@entity3 was not studying at the same university as @entity15 , and is not being held in the same prison			1
he said it is difficult to remain hopeful			0
" the world has collapsed on top of me with this verdict			0
it collapsed on me and @entity8 , " he said			1
he denied that he is still in love with her			0
" but i feel close to her because i consider her my companion in misadventure , " he said			0
he rejected the idea that @entity15 is capable of murder			2
" i do n't even dare think a thing like that			0
it is absurd and inadmissible			0
she is a very sweet girl , " he insisted			0
as their joint appeal came to a close this month , his lawyer , @entity84 , rejected media portrayals of @entity3 as a patsy who fell into the clutches of a femme fatale , @entity15			1
" the lives of this kid and his parents have been destroyed			0
you must today evaluate if -- if -- if these kids committed the crime , " @entity84 told jurors			0
@entity3 may well head for home if the jury decides in his favor			1
@entity3 is from @entity102 , on the @entity104 coast , far south of the central @entity1 university town where he was studying , and in his prison interview he said he misses the smell of the sea			1
" above all my family , " he said in the interview conducted via attorney @entity110			0
" i also miss my friends , the everyday life , the walks in my town 's square			2
and i very much miss the smell of the sea			1
" if he does go home to @entity102 , he hopes simply to blend in , he said			0
" i only hope to be forgotten ; the sooner the better			0
i want to have a normal life , " he said from behind bars			1
" i do n't want to be recognized when i leave the prison			0
" -- @entity2 's @entity122 contributed to this report .			0
