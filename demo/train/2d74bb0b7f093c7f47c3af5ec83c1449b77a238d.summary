with @entity2 , it 's in the stare			1
@entity4 , polite , every bit the sailor - cum - businessman , the clothes are perfectly pressed with not a hair out of place			1
but it 's the look in his brown eyes , the glare that offers a glimpse of the other side of sailing 's @entity16			2
his friend and @entity21 rival skipper @entity20 once described him as the " most competitive man on the planet			1
" and on an industrial estate in a small , understated office -- quintessentially @entity28 -- in @entity29 on @entity31 's south coast , @entity25 's greatest ever sailor is plotting how to win the @entity21			1
" it 's the same drive to win , " he says of @entity25 's bid to seal their first win in the event 's 163 - year history			1
" until we 're on the start line we wo n't know for sure how we 've done			2
it 's exciting and terrifying so you have to keep the intensity			2
" even @entity28 admits to having different personalities on and off the water : " i 'm pretty aggressive and i certainly would n't want to be like that on land			2
" on the water , there 's no shut - off valve , just an unabated desire to win			1
it was there to see in his four olympic gold medal wins , most notably his infamous @entity55 - inspired " do n't make me angry " speech to his rivals at the @entity58			2
it 's even there in training			2
in the build - up to those @entity64 , i traveled to @entity65 to watch @entity28 , already selected for the @entity66 , racing against his @entity68 rivals , who were there simply to support him			1
at dinner the night before , he was quiet and unassuming			2
on the water , it was like a switch had been flicked , a red mist descended			0
@entity28 was determined to win this particular training session , racing as though @entity64 gold was being dangled before him			1
it 's a competitive nature that has landed @entity28 in hot water			0
the contentious tactics he employed to edge out @entity85 and win his first @entity64 title , led to death threats from @entity85 's native @entity88 and @entity28 confesses to " still losing my temper when things are n't going right			1
" now 37 and with a team off 55 staff -- and growing -- around him , he is trying to be calmer and adapt to his new responsibilities			0
there 's certainly a noticeable difference between the @entity97 and the @entity28 of now			0
there 's a calm confidence as he walks through the office from a morning 's sailing , helped it must be said by the knowledge that his staff have bought into his mission -- with many leaving other jobs to work solely for him			0
he might downplay his role -- " i 'm not doing any role specifically bar steering the boat when it 's on the water " -- but @entity28 is @entity25 's @entity21 bid			1
it 's his name -- @entity116 ( @entity117 ) -- on the entrance to the team 's headquarters , on the boat and on the clothing that they wear			0
an essentially shy sportsman who has achieved remarkable feats -- he was also part of @entity128 's @entity21 victory last year -- it 's as if @entity28 has become his very own brand			1
@entity131 , the ideas man of the team that played a key role in @entity128 's dramatic turnaround in @entity135 last year -- before switching allegiances to @entity117 -- says that @entity28 " is almost embarrassed that his name 's on the door			2
" @entity139 concurs : " it 's strange having my name there but it 's something i have to accept because , when we started , the team was n't anything and we had to sell it around a brand if you like			2
" as we build certainly i 'm keen for it rather than being @entity152 for it to ultimately be @entity117 and whoever our partners are			0
" while he used to be focused on winning @entity64 gold every four years , now @entity28 has myriad other tasks to think about			1
" for the first time i 'm having to sell our team and maybe that does n't sit naturally , " he said			2
" it 's more of a sales pitch			0
" he appeared to have pulled off the ultimate @entity165 coup by gaining royal approval for his venture when the @entity168 -- @entity168 -- lent her support as a co-patron with @entity28 of @entity117 's charity , the @entity172			0
the partnership between the knight and the duchess came about after @entity28 took her sister @entity176 sailing			0
once on the ocean , the conversation turned to the @entity181 's fondness for sailing			0
" it got to the discussion , ' would n't it be a great idea if she was supporting the @entity21 team ? ' " explained @entity28 , who then contacted the @entity168 ' office to put in what became a successful request			1
" the duchess is obviously such a global icon really now so it 's a huge positive to have someone like that backing us			0
" queen @entity197 was supposedly on hand to watch the first @entity21 in 1851 ; the duchess is married to @entity201 's great , great , great , great grandson providing a loose symmetry with the 2017 @entity21			1
the battle for the @entity21 , the trophy on offer , has a rich and diverse history , with the first regatta taking place around the @entity209 -- a mere 15 miles from where @entity28 has set up his headquarters			1
so why is it that @entity25 , with its rich maritime history , has never won sailing 's most coveted prize ? " it 's a great question and it goes to show how hard it is , " says @entity28			1
" for sure , we can win it			2
" we would n't be here if we did n't think we could , but i think it needs the right financing and group of people at the same time and we never quite had that before			2
we think that this is a really good group of people			0
we 've pulled together a strong team			0
" @entity28 has adopted a " best of @entity25 " ethos in everything the team does , despite an influx of international staff in certain key roles			1
" in sailing terms , it would be the biggest thing that ever happened in @entity25 sailing , " says @entity28 , reflecting on how big an achievement it would be if the indomitable @entity128 was upset			1
" it would be huge			0
look at @entity243 and @entity244 [ two revered @entity25 sailors ] -- it would be right up there as one of our greatest achievements in @entity25 sailing			1
" in terms of the nation , it 's the last great sporting hurdle that we 've never been able to get over			0
we 've won pretty much everything else in world sport and this is the one that we 've never won			0
" as an eight - year - old , @entity28 's parents @entity260 , who took part in the first @entity262 in 1973 , and @entity263 packed him off on a dingy without a lifejacket and just a duffle coat and wellington boots			1
now he 's effectively the ceo of a $ 130 million business , which recently announced a tie - up with @entity271 design guru @entity270 , who was the engineering brains behind numerous @entity271 title wins			1
@entity270 's pedigree is very much in the mold of @entity28 , whose role of super sub in @entity128 's overturning of an 8 - 1 deficit to win the 2013 @entity21 led to one @entity25 newspaper hailing him a modern - day @entity281			1
" people talk about individuals but it really was a team effort , " he insisted			0
" the designers that helped with the development changes , the shore team , the boat builders that implemented those changes and sailors that pulled it off on the water			0
" there are so many lessons to learn that you never stop developing , never give up , keep pushing through			0
it would have been easy to pack up our bags and disappear			0
but it 's never over , you have to keep going			0
" it 's no surprise then that @entity28 's favorite quote lends itself to another @entity25 military leader -- @entity305			1
" success is not final , failure is not fatal , it is courage to continue that counts			0
" and @entity28 's thirst for victory still remains unquenched after all his victories			0
" our goal ends up with us bringing the @entity21 back to @entity25			1

@entity25 sailor @entity2 is plotting a first @entity25 win in the @entity21 163 - year history
four - time @entity64 champion was billed a modern - day @entity281 for his 2013 *cup* *heroics*
almost *overnight* , he has gone from a modest sailor to a ceo of a $ 130 million brand
