-- not everyone relishes the idea of opening their homes to strangers on vacation			2
but in an era when many travelers want an experience that takes them beyond conventional hotel chains and tourist traps , hospitality exchanges and private home rentals are flourishing			1
such alternatives can come at a high price , as home rental site @entity16 has learned in recent weeks			1
thanks to a spate of highly publicized rental horror stories , @entity16 has announced new property protections and safety measures that draw upon some of the best practices already in place among well - known sites such as the @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , which operates @entity30			1
@entity16 , which pairs people looking for accommodations with hosts for a fee , already represents a hybrid of philosophies underlying hospitality exchanges			1
it claims to be a community where people " can build real connections " with others eager " to enrich the world through the sharing of space			0
" but , unlike the @entity27 and @entity28 , which espouse similar philosophies under the banner of creating a community , money is exchanged and @entity16 takes an additional 15 % cut of that transaction			1
like @entity16 , @entity29 operates as a marketplace , but communications and financial transactions occur between the guest and host off site , with hosts paying only for their listing			1
the operators of those services and one frugal traveler offered suggestions on how to protect your home from thieves and vandals			1
for more information , consult safety policies and rental guidelines on their websites			2
@entity16 apologizes : ' we have really screwed things up ' research potential guests sites like @entity28 and the @entity27 allow hosts to screen potential guests through their profiles , which often read like personal ads , complete with a picture , offering a more intimate sense of who they are			1
plus , user profiles on those sites have rating systems with feedback from previous hosts in the same way sites like @entity89 and @entity90 include buyer and seller feedback			1
" you can tell things from the way people describe themselves on @entity28 , " said travel jounralist @entity94 , former @entity98 " @entity97 " and author of its new series , " getting @entity103			0
" " when i was in @entity106 looking for a place , there were profiles of @entity106 guys in their mid- 20s that only wanted women to stay with them			2
that 's a good warning sign			2
" because sites like @entity28 , @entity27 and @entity16 represent collections of people and not just properties , bad incidents do n't stay hidden long , he said			1
" they 're pretty good at policing themselves when things happen			0
they get talked about and described in user reviews ; it usually comes out into open and gets dealt with , as @entity16 is learning , " @entity94 said			2
@entity16 's enhanced profile features include information like whether users have verified their phone number and connected their @entity130 account			1
hosts also now can set custom trust parameters for bookings so those whose profiles do n't meet specified requirements -- such as verified phone numbers , profile descriptions and location information -- will be unable to make a reservation			0
the @entity27 , which has 670,000 members in 200 countries , goes a step further by requiring guests to provide passport numbers so hosts can verify them			2
" checking the person who shows up at your doorstep is a very big deterrent against something bad happening , " said @entity148 , founder of the @entity27			0
" you have to put in some steps to make it harder for criminals and bad people to gain access to your home			0
" hosts and property managers should also take it upon themselves to do a little extra work if they 're not satisfied with the information available on someone 's profile , @entity148 said			2
@entity170 direct contact with guests before they arrive this is another way for hosts to do a gut check against potential guests			2
after travelers connect with hosts on @entity29 , communication continues off platform via e-mail or telephone , so hosts have control over whether they ultimately decide to open their home			1
" we are a classifieds business : owners list properties along with contact and telephone information , and they enter into contact with potential guests and they handle transactions , " said @entity186 , vice president of @entity29 , which operates @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity187			0
" this allows hosts flexibility and does n't lock them into a decision until they feel completely comfortable with it			0
" @entity28 is based on the concept of community , where a premium is placed on face - to - face interactions and information sharing " members are encouraged to meet each other , either by hosting and surfing each other 's ' couches ' or by participating in the several community events that happen daily worldwide			0
these connections can only be established when the members spend some time with each other -- time is a key factor to build meaningful connections , " a @entity28 spokesman said			0
currently , communication between @entity16 users occurs on its platform until a reservation has been paid for , after which hosts can contact guests via phone or e-mail			1
in an effort to help users make informed decisions , the site has doubled its customer support team to 88 people since last month and will be bringing on a 10 - year veteran from @entity90 as director of customer support next week , ceo @entity225 said on the site 's blog			1
@entity236 : 80 things we wish we knew before we started traveling require some kind of security deposit this is relevant to @entity16 and @entity29 because hosts do n't always meet their guests , unlike @entity28 and the @entity27 , where the primary motivator is to find a bed and a new friend to show guests around			1
@entity29 lets hosts set their own terms for a deposit and also offers the option of a property damage protection plan			0
starting at $ 39 for $ 1,500 in damage , the plan offers three levels of protection that owners can work into the price of each reservation			0
starting august 15 , when hosts book reservations through @entity16 , their personal property will be covered for loss or damage due to vandalism or theft caused by an @entity16 guest up to $ 50,000 , the company announced monday			1
the @entity270 program will also apply to hosts who reported property damage before august 1			0
take the risk , if you dare in a system based on trust and mutual respect , there 's always going to be a bad apple or two , @entity94 said			0
the chain hotels are there to fall back on , but they come at a price , too			0
" the connections between people are what makes travel and life worth living ; they 're far more valuable to me than anything i could get from a hotel and restaurant , " he said			0
" the fact that we get so upset about someone 's house getting trashed shows how rare those instances are			0
