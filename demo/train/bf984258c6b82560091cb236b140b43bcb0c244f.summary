-- the capture of the surviving @entity2 last friday ended the city 's nightmare			1
but for investigators , a huge task lies ahead			1
they " have a million questions , and those questions need to be answered , " @entity8 gov. @entity7 said over the weekend			1
those answers could help authorities explain why two brothers might have done this and how the terrorist attack could have been prevented			2
here is a look at five of the burning questions vexing investigators : 1			1
did the suspects act alone ? preliminary interviews with surviving suspect @entity25 suggest that he and his older brother , @entity26 , were self - radicalized jihadists , not members of a terrorist group , a @entity23 government source said			1
hospitalized since his capture on friday and unable to speak , @entity25 is communicating with investigators by writing and nodding			1
@entity26 has indicated that his older brother , not any international terrorist group , directed last week 's deadly attack in @entity35 , the government source said			1
he has conveyed that @entity26 's motivation stemmed from jihadist thought and the idea that @entity40 is under attack , so jihadists need to fight back , the source said monday			1
authorities might never have all the answers about @entity26 , 26 , who died after an encounter with police early friday			2
nevertheless , the possibility that the @entity26 brothers were members of a terrorist group has not been ruled out			2
the government source cautioned that the interviews were preliminary , and that @entity25 's account needs to be checked out and followed up on by investigators			1
as @entity0 's national security analyst @entity56 points out , the brothers ' e-mail traffic will be of huge interest to investigators as they seek an answer to this question			1
and even if the suspected @entity35 bombers were not connected to a terrorist organization , the brothers may have had help			1
what was @entity26 doing in @entity66 ? the older brother 's six - month trip to @entity66 during the first half of 2012 is also a focal point of the probe			1
his father has said that @entity26 was with him at all times during that trip			0
but investigators are not ruling out that he could have met up with some nefarious characters during that visit to @entity78 , the capital of @entity66 's @entity79 , where his father still lives today			1
" what i 'm very concerned about is that when he went over there , he very well may have been radicalized and trained by these @entity89 rebels , who are the fiercest jihad warriors , " said rep. @entity81 , a @entity82 from @entity83 who is chairman of the @entity85			0
the trip came after the suspect , an accomplished boxer , became increasingly religious , his aunt said			0
after returning from the trip , @entity26 started a @entity97 channel with links to various videos			0
two were posted under a category labeled " terrorists , " but later deleted			0
it 's not clear by whom			1
a @entity0 analysis of the @entity97 channel determined one deleted video featured a militant named @entity107 , whose real name was @entity109			0
@entity66 security services killed @entity109 in december during an assault on an apartment in @entity78			0
the investigation also will look into whether @entity26 made other trips to the northern @entity115 , @entity81 said sunday			0
a look at @entity26 's past 3			1
how did @entity25 go from ' lovely kid ' to suspected terrorist ? after the @entity122 named the two suspects on thursday night , many who knew the brothers expressed disbelief -- particularly friends of @entity25			1
he was " a lovely , lovely kid , " said @entity126 , a former teacher at the younger @entity26 's high school			1
@entity126 described the young man as compassionate , caring , and jovial			0
@entity129 , the boys ' uncle -- who made headlines for calling the boys " losers " -- said he believes @entity26 influenced his younger brother			0
investigators are looking into whether that was the case			2
some acquaintances of the boys believe @entity25 may have been brainwashed by his brother			1
" all i can say is i think his brother put him up to it , " said @entity139 , who co-captained the high school wrestling team with @entity25			1
" there 's no way in heck that he would do it			2
mentally , he 's just not that kind of guy			2
" uncle : @entity150 friend ' brainwashed him completely ' 4			0
why was n't the @entity122 tracking @entity26 ? acting on @entity66 's concerns that @entity26 was a follower of radical @entity40 , @entity122 agents interviewed the older brother in 2011 , an @entity122 official said			2
but the @entity66 government 's request was vague and the lack of specifics limited how much the @entity122 was able to investigate @entity26 , according to a @entity23 official and a law enforcement source			2
nevertheless , many are wondering why this young man seemingly dropped off the @entity122 's radar in the years since , particularly after his six - month trip to @entity66 's unstable @entity165			2
" this man was pointed out by a foreign government to be dangerous			0
he was interviewed by the @entity122 once ... then , he went to @entity66			0
... why was n't he interviewed when he came back either at the airport when he was returning or later ? " @entity169 sen. @entity168 of @entity170 said to @entity0			0
@entity122 takes heat over @entity35 bombing suspect @entity82 sen. @entity173 also voiced concern about the @entity122 's handling of @entity26 , but the senator from @entity177 pulled back his criticism on monday , saying that the problem might have been partly the result of @entity26 's misspelled name on a travel document			1
many lawmakers are asking whether the @entity122 should have done more			0
" i think there 's going to be an awful lot of questions about this , that 's going to be looked at over the coming months and maybe longer than that , " said rep. @entity184 , a @entity8 @entity185			1
" like every situation , i have faith that the @entity122 and other agencies have done their job			0
can they improve their job going forward ? absolutely			0
why was an @entity197 police officer killed ? this is another missing piece of the puzzle			0
police do n't know why @entity201 , a young @entity197 campus police officer , was killed -- allegedly by the @entity26 brothers			0
@entity201 was inside his police vehicle thursday night after responding to a loud disturbance call when he was shot and killed on the @entity197 campus , according to @entity207 police chief @entity206			0
" it appears that the suspects approached from the rear ... and then fired four to five shots into the cruiser , " @entity150 police commissioner @entity208 said on " @entity209 " monday			2
a short time after the @entity197 shooting , the suspects are believed to have carjacked an suv about a mile away			2
later , @entity26 was killed in a police confrontation			0
the motive for @entity201 's killing is unknown , @entity208 said			1
" we really have no idea at this point in time			0

the capture of @entity25 last week ended @entity35 's nightmare
yet , investigators must answer " a million questions "
there is still no clear motive for last week 's bombings
and it 's still unclear if the suspects acted alone
