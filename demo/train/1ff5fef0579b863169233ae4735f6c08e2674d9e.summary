-- the nation 's aviation security chief is sticking to his decision to permit small knives on planes , despite increasing pressure to reverse course			1
there was immediate opposition from some pilots and flight attendants to the decision last week by @entity13 administrator @entity12			1
those flight crew members are concerned the decision dangerously relaxes aviation security and sends the wrong message to a flying public eager for more simplicity and efficiency in passenger and bag screening			2
but the situation in @entity23 grew more intense on monday			0
by afternoon , more than 20,000 people had signed a petition to whitehouse.gov calling on the @entity13 to keep knives off planes			1
moreover , key lawmakers have sought a reversal of the decision , and the biggest airlines are now wondering if the mater was thought through carefully enough			1
" additional discussion is warranted before items that have been banned for more than 11 years are allowed back on aircraft , " said the industry 's chief trade group , @entity35			1
one industry leader , @entity40 chief executive @entity39 , said previously the decision will add little to aviation security efficiency while raising risks for passengers and crew members			2
but @entity12 is resolute that the move is correct , that @entity48 aviation security has improved since the 2001 @entity49 hijack attacks on the @entity48 to the point that the likelihood of a similar plot succeeding against a commercial airliner is remote			1
" our intent is to implement the changes on april 25 , " @entity13 spokesman @entity55 told @entity0 on monday			1
@entity59 is expected to defend the decision on thursday at a @entity62 hearing			2
flight attendants : decision does n't make sense @entity55 said the new rule is consistent with @entity12 's embrace of risk - based security			2
this emphasizes detection of liquid explosives and improvised bombs that experts say pose a far greater risk to airline security			0
experts believe hardened cockpit doors and engaged passengers minimize chances that hijackers using small knives would be successful			1
bombs , however , can be hard to detect and can get aboard planes in a number of ways , including cargo			0
the agency , created in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks , banned small blades and other sharp objects in response			1
over the past decade , it has added and subtracted items from its prohibited list , permitting small screwdrivers , small scissors , cigarette lighters and matches , and banning large quantities of liquids and gels			0
the @entity13 said the latest decision will bring the @entity48 into basic compliance with international standards			1
these allow knives shorter than 6 centimeters , or 2.3 inches , aboard aircraft			2
@entity55 said @entity59 twice considered internal proposals to alter the list without making changes			0
but in his third review , which included vetting by @entity13 leadership and security experts , @entity12 opted to act			2
@entity13 screeners find 4 - 5 guns on a typical day in response to concerns from @entity120 leadership , @entity12 continued excluding small knives that most closely resemble weapons , specifically those with blades that lock in place or have molded hand grips			1
he also decided to keep box cutters and razor blades on the prohibited items list because there is " too much emotion associated " with their use in the 9/11 hijackings			0
still , sen. @entity135 , @entity137 - @entity136 , and rep. @entity138 , @entity139 , both called upon @entity59 over the weekend to reconsider his decision			0
and on monday , rep. @entity141 of @entity142 said the decision appeared to have been made " in a vacuum " and will impact millions of passengers			0
@entity141 is the senior @entity146 on the panel that will hear @entity12 's testimony later this week			0
others opposing the change include the @entity151 , representing nearly 90,000 flight attendants , and the @entity153 ( @entity153 ) , which represents 22,000 airline pilots			0
the journey of airport security booty " we believe the threat is still real and the removal of any layer of security will put crew members and the flying public unnecessarily in harm 's way , " @entity153 president @entity157 said			0
in addition to the small knives , the @entity13 will allow passengers to carry two golf clubs , toy bats or other sports sticks -- such as ski poles , hockey sticks , lacrosse sticks and pool cues -- aboard in carry - on luggage			1
@entity12 said in a three - month period last year , the @entity13 seized 47 small knives from passengers at @entity180 alone			1
but the knives presented little threat to the plane , he said			0
" our greatest concern , the greatest risk , is non-metalic ieds , whether that 's explosive , whether that 's ( an ) electronic initiator or a chemical initiator , whatever that may be			0
that 's what i want security officers to focus on , " he said .			0

@entity13 rolled back prohibition on small knives aboard commercial flights
new : 20,000 signatures on @entity199 *website* seeking reversal of decision
small knives were banned after the @entity204 hijack attacks
