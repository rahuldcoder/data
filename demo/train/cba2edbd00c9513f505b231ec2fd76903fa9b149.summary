@entity1 , @entity0 -- imagine abandoning your own children because you ca n't afford to feed and clothe them			1
it 's a parent 's nightmare that in @entity0 , mired in economic crisis , is increasingly becoming reality			1
@entity9 , 34 , from @entity1 , is a single mother , unemployed and unable to care for her three young children			1
because of the poor economic climate in @entity0 , she felt she had no choice but to leave them in a care home , which she tries to visit every few weeks			1
" it 's really difficult , really tragic for a true mother to leave her children , " she told @entity2			1
" but when you understand they are not at fault and deserve a future , it 's better to make a move like this , than have them beside you without even a plate of food			2
" after years of recession , and biting austerity measures , including job cuts and tax rises , @entity0 is in financial despair			2
the @entity34 , which compiles data for the state , said the unemployment rate in the first quarter of the year was 22.6 %			0
it also said 27.7 % of the @entity0 population is on the verge of poverty or facing the danger of poverty			2
the numbers do n't include groups like @entity46 , who are @entity48 , illegal immigrants , the homeless and institutionalized people			0
the country 's heavily indebted economy is dependent on bailout funds from the @entity55 , @entity56 and the @entity57			1
what will @entity0 elections mean for the country 's future ? but that troika is demanding deeper cuts to social spending , creating what social workers are calling a wave of " economic orphans , " abandoned not through lack of love , but money			1
" i think this is the first time i 've seen so many poor families asking for help for their own children , " says @entity71 , director of @entity72 , a @entity74 charity providing support for struggling @entity0 families , including orphanages			1
the authority lacks a count for economic orphans , but one of its statistics signals potential problems for families			0
it says 22.9 % of all types of families with children under the age of 18 are on the verge of or face the danger of poverty			0
" before the economic crisis , the majority of our kids came from problem families , with parents who were drug addicts or alcoholics			1
now most new arrivals are from families who ca n't afford them , " he adds			0
@entity9 says she wants to take her children home , but ca n't afford it			0
" i feel powerless for being unable to stand on my own two feet , " she says , blaming successive @entity0 governments for her predicament			0
" for me , its all those who govern			0
they 've all looked out for themselves instead of the people and the poor like us , who should be the responsibility of the @entity120			0
" but in @entity0 , the state can barely afford to care			2
