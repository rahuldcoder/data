@entity0 is literally choking on itself			1
it uses as much coal as the rest of the world combined			0
the @entity6 smog in january was so thick it could be seen clearly in space			0
and , most shockingly , @entity0 's bad air is said to kill nearly 700,000 people a year			1
to fight @entity0 's catastrophic air pollution , @entity0 's eco-warriors need to know where it 's coming from			1
and big gains are being made on that front			0
after intense online public pressure last year , more than 80 cities in @entity0 have started to monitor and publish real - time data on the dangerous air pollutant @entity18			1
pm 2.5s are particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter , small enough to penetrate and lodge deep into the lungs			0
@entity0 environmentalist @entity24 says the new rollout of @entity18 readings in @entity0 is the direct result of online people power			1
" at the beginning of 2011 , when the government revised its air quality standards , it stated in the first draft that @entity18 would not be monitored or disclosed , " @entity24 said			1
" and then people made such an outcry over the @entity36 , especially through the microblogs			0
eventually , the government changed its policy by the end of the year			2
" @entity24 's book " @entity0 's @entity42 " has been compared to @entity44 's " @entity43 , " the 1962 publication which exposed the effects of pesticides on the environment and since been named one of the top 25 science books of all time			2
a former journalist , @entity24 has become one of @entity0 's leading environmental watchdogs			2
it 's his personal and professional mission to bring better air to the people of @entity0			1
to do just that , he 's using social technology as a force for change			2
@entity24 and his team at the @entity6 - based non-profit @entity63 ( @entity64 ) have launched a social media mapping program to name and shame @entity0 's biggest polluters			1
called " take a picture to locate a polluter , " the mission of the project is clear			0
@entity0 netizens send pictures of suspected polluters to @entity24 and his team via the popular microblogging site @entity76			1
@entity64 then fact - checks and uploads the data to its online map			0
@entity64 monitors 15,000 enterprises which are on a " @entity84 " list published by the government			0
@entity24 says these enterprises are responsible for 65 % of @entity0 's water and air pollution			1
with the help of @entity76 users , @entity64 has now located nearly 4,000 of those enterprises on its digital map			0
" the next step is a call for total transparency and the disclosure of all these major polluters in @entity0 so they will all be shown on a digital map , " @entity24 said			1
@entity99 protest in @entity0 has forced the government 's hand to offer better air quality monitoring			1
@entity99 mapping has expanded access to pollution data in a user - friendly way			1
but can social technology ultimately help clear the haze in @entity0 ? @entity109 , head of the @entity111 's @entity0 program in @entity6 , helps the government develop its own blueprint for sustainability			1
she calls @entity0 's social activism an opportunity for @entity6			1
" the rising tide of public outrage is an opportunity for the new leadership of @entity0 to get serious about pollution control , to strengthen the standards , to tighten enforcement , and to really establish a strong rule of law -- using the power of the public			2
" @entity127 , the under secretary for the environment in @entity129 , agrees that social media is an environmental game - changer : " it 's not good enough just to say , ' hey , things are bad and here 's the data			1
' so i think it 's going to lead to a very fundamental change			0
" " it forces people to be much better educated about pollution			0
and secondly , it will have an impact on the speed of change in government policies , " @entity141 added			0
@entity0 's eco-warriors have said repeatedly the biggest hurdle to change is not a lack of money or even technology			2
@entity0 has the cash and the leadership in sustainable technology to roll out tools to green the country			2
the biggest challenge is the lack of motivation -- the lack of a strong enforcement of rules and regulations that should come from successful environmental lawsuits and litigation			0
@entity24 says his social tools will change that , forcing @entity0 's worst offenders to be accountable for their environmental practices			2
" their color ( on the map ) is going to change if they break the rules and regulations , " says @entity24			0
" with that , we hope to break the protection by the local government for those polluters and also help people collect the evidence so they can file a lawsuit in a far easier way			2
" so give them the data			0
have them argue about the benefits for change			0
and take a deep breath .			0
