-- the urge to undress a mummy can be strong			1
in the 19th century , @entity3 did n't think twice about tearing off a mummy 's wrappings			1
even @entity6 could n't avoid the indignity of being stripped bare in front of an audience of curious onlookers			0
today 's experts in the field know better			2
" certainly , it 's a damaging process , and you lose a lot of information and disturb the mummy itself			1
it 's also something that is no longer necessary with advancements in technology , " says dr. @entity19 , the curator of physical anthropology at the @entity21 in @entity22			1
the institute 's vast collection of sarcophagi has remained largely undisturbed for over 200 years			2
this year , however , researchers have again decided to peek underneath the linens ( and skin and muscle ) , though this time using the @entity34 's dual - energy ct scanner -- one of the most advanced in @entity22			1
the data they gather from the scans is then plugged into the same 3d - modeling software used by car companies to analyze engines			1
the technology has given them the clearest picture to date of what life was like along the @entity47 2,500 years ago			0
" you can tell the software what part are bandages and bone and skin , and you can peel away those layers			2
you can virtually remove the bandages to look at the body and any amulets covering the body , then remove the skin to look at the bones and any preserved organs , " says @entity19			2
" what that means in normal language is we 're able to see a lot more , a lot more clearly			0
" @entity68 , the temple singer of the corpses they 've scanned , eight will be on exhibit at the @entity21 from may 22			1
the star of the show is undoubtedly @entity68 , a priestess and temple singer who died in @entity77 , @entity78 around 900 bc. the ct scans have allowed researchers to make a lot of new discoveries about @entity68			1
by analyzing her pelvic bone , they were able to find her approximate age ( between 30 and 50 )			2
gazing into her arteries , they found a possible cause of death -- plaque build - up that could have resulted in a heart attack or stroke			0
@entity19 's team could also see the amulets placed around her body in vivid detail ( several of which have been @entity101 printed using the ct scan data )			1
" we 're even able to discern the inscriptions on some of the amulets , " notes @entity19 , including one of the @entity104 on a plate covering the incision used to remove her internal organs			0
" @entity104 was believed to have healing properties , so it could have been used to heal her wounds in the afterlife , " explains @entity19			0
the man with bad teeth the scans also revealed surprises about another of the of the @entity21 's mummies			1
despite being in a woman 's sarcophagus , ct scans told researchers the body was male , that he died around 600 @entity126 , and that he probably lived in terrible pain because of a plethora of dental abscesses			1
" we 've found that a lot of the mummies had terrible dental health issues , specifically tooth decay and numerous abscesses caused by infections that spread to the blood stream , " says @entity19			0
the unknown man is a particularly unique specimen , in that he is also evidence of a botched embalming job			0
scans show both chunks of brain still present inside his skull , as well as part of the spatula used to remove it			0
" there are few examples of such probes , and it 's great to see the shape of the one they would have used , " says @entity19			0
" it highlights some of the issues embalmers were confronted with			0
the hole on the inside of the skull through which the brain is extracted is rarely bigger than 2.5 centimeters , demonstrating a strong knowledge of human anatomy			0

new ct scans help researchers " undress " a mummy virtually
the @entity21 uses the same software employed by car companies to make @entity101 models
researchers can now approximate a mummy 's age , cause of death and *general* health
