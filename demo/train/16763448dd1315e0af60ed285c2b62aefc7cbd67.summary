" i 've given everything this season			2
" i do n't think i 'll be able to recover my energy over the summer -- not the energy needed to motivate a group			0
i definitely wo n't be coaching next season , though i do n't know if i 'd even have had any offers			0
" @entity4 coach @entity36 also cited fatigue when he announced he would quit the @entity39 club at the end of this season			1

on announcing the appointment , @entity1 's sporting director @entity48 said : " @entity2 represents an idea of football that we would like to follow , which imposes itself today through @entity14 and @entity4			1
" i was looking for someone outside of @entity57 football			0
" @entity2 was charged with overhauling an aging squad and bringing flair to the team in a notoriously defense - minded league			2
the 35 - year - old club icon @entity62 was left on the bench for some games , while @entity4 attacker @entity65 was brought in , but failed to sparkle			1
" i still believe you can play attractive football in @entity57 and i think the best way to do that is with attacking football , " @entity2 said			2
" i know that i have to improve defensive aspects and i will , do n't worry about that			0
" @entity22 said @entity2 's departure would n't spell the end of the club 's new philosophy			1
" the project has n't failed , " he said			0
" we want to carry on playing a certain type of football , and from league statistics @entity1 is the team that has had more possession than any other , and is third behind @entity84 and @entity85 for territorial dominance and pass completion			2
" this says a lot about the quality of play			0
the failure has been how our league campaign went , but the style of play was want we wanted from the beginning			0
" @entity2 said he planned to stay in the @entity57 capital for several months to get to know the city better and that he would never regret his decision to try coaching in @entity57			2
however , he said he would n't miss the local media			0
" nearly everything that 's been written was lies , " he said			0
" and we 're still hearing them now			0
