-- walking into @entity2 , @entity4 's @entity3 for the 27th annual @entity6 induction ceremony last night , it was hard to not think of the @entity7 striking an iceberg on the very same day 100 years ago			1
in recent days @entity9 and @entity10 , two of the biggest stars entering the @entity13 this year , pulled out of the show , making complete reunion performances by the @entity16 and @entity17 impossible			1
@entity19 guitarist @entity18 opted not to come , and the @entity21 ' @entity20 stayed home as he continues to recover from cancer			1
one might think that these absences would sink the induction ceremony somewhere deep into the @entity27 , but it turns out they did n't matter much at all			1
in fact , it was one of the best @entity13 induction ceremonies in recent memory			1
" i do n't know that it matters who 's here tonight , because it 's about the music that these bands played , " @entity17 bassist @entity33 said during his induction speech			1
minutes after making that point , @entity33 walked over across to the stage to play an explosive three - song set of @entity17 songs with @entity43 , guitarist @entity44 , @entity46 singer @entity45 and drummers @entity47 and @entity49			1
fans were screaming out " @entity60 " through much of the night , but the moment the group launched into " mr. @entity53 , " @entity33 and @entity55 's decision to not attend the ceremony was completely forgotten , and this previously unassembled lineup of the band proved they could revive the spirit of @entity17 on their own			1
@entity49 was grinning from ear - to - ear during a note - perfect " @entity62 , " and the finale of " @entity64 " had nearly every single person in the audience screaming at the top of their lungs			1
a powerful singer , @entity45 hit every @entity9 - patented banshee wail perfectly			1
the faces also soldiered on without their lead singer , recruiting @entity75 's @entity74 to fill his slot			2
he 's done a bunch of shows with the group over the past few years , and he sounds exactly like early 1970s - era @entity10			1
" @entity84 " was a lot of fun , but they absolutely destroyed with " @entity83			2
" @entity85 played guitar with fiery passion , almost like he was trying to prove to @entity74 and @entity88 that he 's in fighting shape for a @entity91 tour			1
@entity92 demonstrated that he 's still one of the greatest keyboardists in rock and roll , and drummer @entity96 still has the chops that got him @entity99 's old job in the late 1970s			2
here 's hoping that one day @entity10 comes to his senses and agrees to a tour with these guys			2
the @entity21 had no intention of performing without @entity20 , so the roots were joined by @entity105 and @entity106 of @entity107 for an incredible medley of @entity21 classics , including " @entity110 " and " so what'cha want			1
" @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity106 all wore matching green @entity115 track suits , and they did a great job of channeling the energy and spirit of the groundbreaking trio			2
the evening kicked off with a surprise performance by @entity123 , who did a bombastic rendition of the @entity127 deep cut " @entity128			2
" few in the audience seemed to know the song , but @entity131 worked the large room like a pro and got everyone pumped for the long night of music and speeches ahead of them			1
per tradition , @entity6 co-founder @entity137 addressed the crowd early on			2
" i believe in the magic of rock and roll , " he said			2
" that magic can set you free			1
ladies and gentlemen , tonight you 've entered a place where magic happens			2
" @entity149 and @entity150 of @entity151 delivered the first induction speech of the evening , honoring the late blues guitarist @entity153			2
@entity153 's daughter , @entity154 , spoke warmly about her father			2
" he inspired so many young blues artists , " she said			2
" i remember going to a show when i was 14 and meeting @entity158 for the first time			2
he said to my dad , ' how can i play the blues like you ? ' my dad said , ' if you do n't feel the blues , you 'll never play the blues			2
' " after a smoking blues guitar battle by @entity149 , @entity170 and @entity171 on @entity153 songs " hideaway " and " @entity174 , " @entity168 came onstage to induct @entity175			1
" he was my inspiration , " @entity168 said			2
" i would n't just listen to @entity175			2
i would live @entity175 , which means i was stealing all my s * * * from @entity175			2
other artists -- and you know who you guys are -- called that being inspired			2
" @entity175 read a short poem , then played " @entity186 " and " @entity187 " before duetting with @entity168 on " @entity185			1
" @entity188 broke down into tears near the end of her speech about @entity192 , who died of ovarian cancer in 1997			0
" in a world full of imitators saying ' fake it till you make it , ' she was a complete original , " said @entity188			0
" she was in a league all her own			0
when you put her records on , you 'd think they were made yesterday			0
she embodies what we all want to be , if only we had the guts ... she was an ornament on the @entity206			0
everyone is so gratified to see this day finally come around at last			0
" @entity208 then honored @entity192 with a gorgeous take on " @entity210 " on the piano			0
many non-performers were honored during the ceremony			0
@entity214 inducted @entity215 , who was her boss and mentor during her days as a @entity219 songwriter in the late 1950s and early 1960s			0
@entity220 honored the late record executive with an extremely powerful version of " @entity223 , " which she sang with @entity224 and the @entity225			0
later in the evening , @entity226 presented the @entity227 to @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230			0
in the middle of the evening , the @entity13 made up for some past oversights by having @entity233 induct the @entity234 ( who backed @entity234 ) , the @entity243 ( @entity244 ) , the @entity241 ( @entity242 ) , the @entity239 ( @entity240 ) , the @entity235 ( @entity235 ) and the @entity236 , who backed @entity233 for the first two decades of his career			0
the surviving members of all six groups took the stage together , and it was very moving to see these largely overlooked musicians finally getting the credit they deserved for their huge role in rock history			0
@entity253 frontman @entity252 and @entity254 teamed up to induct the @entity21			1
" they still are one of the greatest live acts in music , " said @entity252 " they challenged the conventions in the music business and made up their own rules about what it means to be world class hip - hop cats ... they always insisted ( on ) maturing as musicians and human beings			1
" @entity254 said that he owes his entire career to the @entity269			0
" i would n't be here today without them , " he said			0
" the @entity21 actually played my demo for @entity272 in his @entity274 dorm room			1
a lot of people do n't know that			0
" @entity278 read the audience a letter from @entity20			1
" i 'd like to dedicate this to my brothers @entity20 and @entity283 , " he wrote			1
" they walked the globe with me			0
it 's also for anyone who has ever been touched by our band			0
this induction is as much ours as it is yours			0
" @entity123 initially seemed like a slightly odd choice to induct @entity17 , but @entity294 spoke extremely eloquently about group			1
" ' @entity296 ' is the greatest debut album of all time , " he said			0
" every song hits hard on all emotion levels and takes you on a journey through the seedy underworld of @entity303 in brutal sequence ... the thing that set them apart from everybody else was guts , heart and soul			1
most important , they told the truth			0
" not a single member of @entity17 mentioned @entity9 by name in their speech			1
@entity47 gently teased @entity49 for somehow managing to get fired from @entity17 for a drug addiction , and @entity49 gave a surprisingly brief speech that culminated with him quoting " @entity320 " by @entity319			1
@entity43 admitted that all the drama building up to the ceremony almost caused him to bail , but his wife ultimately talked him into attending			1
keyboardist @entity324 and guitarist @entity55 opted not to come			0
it was about 12:30 a.m. when @entity326 stepped up to the podium to induct the @entity19			1
" a lot of people are upset that @entity9 did n't come tonight , " he said			0
" but let 's face it			0
even if he was coming tonight , he would n't be here by now			0
where the f * * * is @entity9 ? " he went on to explain that he first saw the @entity19 when he tried to see @entity334 in @entity335 , but walked into the wrong club			1
" my friends and i were like , ' what the f * * * is this s * * * ? there 's a lot of white people in here , ' " @entity105 said			0
" they came out and i could n't understand a f * * * * * * word they said , and they had socks on their d * * * * ! i had never been to a white show before , so i thought all white groups put socks on their d * * * *			0
years later , they 're one of the biggest groups in the world and getting inducted into the @entity6			0
they have black ties on their d * * * * tonight			0
" @entity18 may have stayed home , but former drummers @entity362 and @entity364 were in the house			0
at 1:00 a.m. , the group ( with three drummers ) did a three - song set of " by the way , " " @entity371 " and " @entity369			1
" " i have n't played with @entity364 in 25 years ! " @entity372 said to the crowd			1
" he 's a beautiful man			0
" at the end of " @entity369 , " @entity374 invited everyone back to the stage			1
@entity43 , @entity85 , @entity131 , @entity96 and even audience member @entity378 crammed onstage for a euphoric finale of @entity381 's " @entity380			1
" in typical @entity13 fashion , the jam was completely chaotic , but everyone in the house seemed to be having a great time			0
the five - and - a - half hour show wrapped up at 1:30 a.m. , and as the crowd poured onto the @entity2 streets in search of their cars or an after party , not a single person was talking about @entity9			1
it turns out they did n't even need him			0
