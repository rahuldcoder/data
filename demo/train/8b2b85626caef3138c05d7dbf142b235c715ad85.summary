@entity1 hailed his stunning shot against @entity4 as the best of his career			1
the world number one produced a near - faultless performance to defeat fourth seed @entity4 in straight sets to reach his sixth consecutive @entity13 @entity12 at @entity14 , but it was an outrageous shot to set up match point that will be most remembered			1
it came with @entity4 serving at 6 - 5 down in the third set			2
at love 30 - 0 up @entity1 dashed back to the baseline and hit a winner through his legs that flew over the net and past @entity4 into the corner for match point			1
" i think it was the greatest shot i have ever hit in my life , " @entity1 told @entity0			2
" i have hit some good ones over all the matches i have played , but i think this one , especially under the circumstances at love 30 - up and with having chance to maybe clinch the match , was amazing			0
" i got a standing ovation and people went crazy -- here in @entity35 the crowds are fantastic -- as it was the perfect shot to hit , at exactly the right time , and i ca n't believe i pulled it off			2
" @entity1 also revealed he is producing his best tennis because he is under less pressure than perhaps he was at the same time last year			2
at this stage in 2008 @entity1 had not won a grand slam but after winning the @entity45 and a historic 15th major at @entity47 this time round he admitted he is more relaxed			1
" i have a little bit less pressure to prove myself after reaching the @entity51 everyone was talking about and i also i won in @entity53 , " he added			0
" getting through the pregnancy with my wife @entity55 and having two beautiful daughters is also something that relaxes you for sure			0
but at the same time when you walk out on center court there will always be a certain type of pressure which will be there for the rest of my career			0
" i just have to make sure i handle it correctly			0
i always play my best tennis towards the end of a tournament and i am happy that it is continued in this match after everything that has already happened this year			0
" @entity1 will play @entity75 's @entity74 who reached his first grand slam final after he crushed @entity77 in the other semifinal			1
