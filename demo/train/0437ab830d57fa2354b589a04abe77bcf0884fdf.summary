@entity1 -- " go home ! " she yelled at me			1
" why do n't you go back home to @entity7 before you ruin this country like you ruined your own ! " i was standing in a crowd at the @entity11 festival in @entity1 , where i live			1
a few minutes earlier i 'd met a group of five people who 'd been standing in front of me -- here from @entity16 -- and i had begun speaking @entity17 with them			1
@entity1 has a growing @entity20 community , and i am actively involved			1
whenever i get the chance to speak to someone in @entity17 here , i introduce myself			1
my new acquaintances and i were talking about what a great time we were having and how remarkable the city of @entity1 was for bringing back the festival to @entity29			1
and that 's when i heard the yelling woman next to me			1
as if " go home " was n't clear enough , the woman -- a 20 - something @entity35 -- repeated the words in @entity17			1
" vete ! " i froze			2
i did n't quite know what to say , and i did n't want to believe she was talking to me or the group of people i had just met			2
as a third - generation @entity44 - @entity43 growing up in @entity42 , i had never encountered such overt racism			1
in fact , because my family was long since assimilated , among my @entity20 friends i was always considered the " pocho " or " white boy " of the group			1
( as i write this , a part of me knows somewhere in @entity54 , a friend of mine will be proud to know someone actually considered me @entity44 enough to yell " go home " at me			1
) my @entity44 friends remind me that i am @entity43 first , @entity44 second and that my @entity60 is better than my @entity17			1
" yes , " i tell them			2
" but i can never walk into a room and be white			2
" evidently , to some the brown color of my skin means i 'm not even @entity43			1
my friends and family tell me what i experienced that night is a microcosm of what is happening to @entity69 across the country			1
you do n't have to look hard to find it			2
in news stories , in political discourse , on talk radio , in everyday conversation it seems it has become ok to treat @entity69 in a negative and antagonistic way -- whether they are new immigrants or longtime @entity43			1
the anti-immigration legislation sweeping across the @entity43 has made this plain			1
people in my @entity20 networks say they 've noticed the change			2
and now i understand what they mean			2
like many @entity43 whose grandparents or parents came here from somewhere else , i live at the intersection of my two cultures			1
i eat tacos , but i love cheeseburgers			2
i go salsa dancing , and listen to rock n ' roll			2
i speak @entity17 and @entity60 , and depending on the crowd , sometimes spanglish			1
i love my country and my cultural community			2
my duality is my reality , just like the 50 million other @entity69 in the @entity43			1
i have been luckier than many			2
before this incident , the closest i 'd ever come to blatant racism was in junior high			1
i was in the jazz band and played first trumpet			0
one day our jazz band teacher invited in his predecessor , a local legend who had made @entity108 's jazz program famous in the 1980s			0
the visiting instructor pointed me out and asked me to play him 16 bars of music			0
i did , but he quickly interrupted			0
" stop , stop , stop			0
i do n't want to hear any of that mariachi music			0
" i did n't think anything of it			0
instead i felt terrible that the legend standing in front of me did n't think i was good enough			0
i went home that night , and like every night , at 6:30 p.m. my family sat down for dinner to talk about our day			1
" how was your day , @entity126 ? " my dad asked			0
outraged , the next day he went to my principal and filed a formal complaint			0
the legend did n't come back to visit the jazz program again			0
weeks later we received a letter in the mail from him apologizing for his insensitive comments			0
my family saved the letter			0
my father was hypersensitive to ethnic identity and deeply proud of his @entity20 heritage			0
the son of a naturalized immigrant from @entity141 and a @entity44 mother from @entity143 , he grew up in @entity42 during a time of racial tension			0
when i was young he would tell me stories of the race riots in his high school , violence against people of color , and awful accounts of the struggle he had to make it as a @entity44 - @entity43 teen in the 1960s			1
he died when i was 17 years old , but one of the phrases he implanted in my mind before he passed was a statement activist @entity157 made famous : " @entity160 " -- " yes you can			0
" and now , here i was , at 28 , with this stranger yelling at me to " leave			0
" i stood there in the middle of a damp crowd on a late @entity1 evening , not comprehending , the wind still and the vibrations of @entity169 's " yellow " filling the space in the air			1
i did n't say a thing			0
i did n't have to			0
the crowd around us looked in amazement at this woman			1
some of them spoke up to her , telling her she was wrong to talk to us like that			0
the group of people from @entity16 looked at her in disgust and , realizing from the look on my face that i must not be accustomed to what i was hearing , they turned toward me to offer support			0
one of them , a young man , grabbed my hand and raised it high in the air			0
" estamos aqui , " he said , which translates to " we are here			0
" it was the " @entity160 " moment			0
the woman continued to taunt us for some minutes , but when we did not reciprocate her hatred , she stopped			2
the band played a few more songs before ending the set , and the crowd dispersed across the park into the saturday evening			0
as i walked away , the woman and i locked eyes			2
" i do n't think you understand who you said that to , " i told her			0
thinking to myself , i am as @entity43 as you are			1
" what , " she said laughing			0
" are you some kind of celebrity or something ? " no. but like the @entity7 i was standing with , i am a human being			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			1

@entity219 says a woman yelled racist words at him at a *concert* in @entity1
he 'd been speaking @entity17 to new acquaintances ; her treatment left him *speechless*
growing *anti-latino* sentiment in @entity43 is aimed at both immigrants and citizens , he says
@entity233 : i 'm third - generation @entity235 ; human , like my new friends . and i 'm home
