-- photographers have their own version of sleight of hand			1
they can manipulate people , objects , landscapes and light in images , fooling lesser humans into believing the final product is a representation of reality , rather than something created by hand			2
in the old language , we called this " trick photography			2
" now , in the @entity19 age , we just call it " @entity21			2
" the latest version of @entity21 , the flagship image - editing application in @entity24 's @entity23 , adds a new stack of cards to the photographer 's trick deck			1
@entity0 was shown demos of new tools in @entity31 -- such as the new content aware fill and @entity33 tools -- that we expect will amaze and please photographers with the tools ' ability to bend pixels with absolute precision			1
@entity31 will arrive as part of @entity23 5 , the company 's package of 14 productivity apps for visual designers , photographers and publishers			1
@entity46 will ship later this month ( or possibly early may ) according to @entity24			1
prices for the suite range between $ 1,300 and $ 2,600 depending on which package you buy , with upgrades priced between $ 500 and $ 1,500			1
@entity31 alone will cost $ 700 , or $ 200 for an upgrade			1
@entity53 , which has some additional tools , will cost $ 1,000 , or $ 350 for an upgrade			1
this year marks the 20th anniversary of @entity21 's arrival , and there are certainly several " wow " features in @entity31 which achieve a level of technological advancement most of us could n't have even dreamed of twenty years ago			1
most impressive is the new content aware fill brush , a mind - bending tool that can remove large objects from photos , altering the background to make it realistically appear as though the object was never there			2
it can zap tourists , delete power lines and otherwise alter photos with click - and - drag ease			2
this video shows it most plainly			2
fast forward to about the halfway point if you want to see the really crazy stuff			2
( when this video first started making the rounds in march , some thought it was a hoax			2
it 's not -- this is a real feature of @entity31			1
) as with any new tool in @entity21 , expect content aware fill to be overused : a surfeit of tourist - free images of @entity89 will soon be littering @entity90			2
but beyond the novelty , it 's a truly useful touch - up tool that turns what used to be hours of work into a simple drag of the brush			2
speaking of brushes , all of the painting features in @entity21 -- neglected since the release of @entity21 -- have been rewritten			2
the app now features much more realistic interactions			0
if you use a digitizer tablet , you 'll find that your brushes are considerably more responsive			0
the angle of the stylus now controls the edge of the brush and the new paint mixing tools control color blending , wetness and bristle length , making for a very life - like painting experience			1
another bit of @entity21 trickery that 's become popular lately is high dynamic range imaging , or @entity33			1
the @entity90 crowd is crazy for it , and @entity24 has responded by improving @entity120 to @entity33 tool , which helps you create @entity33 images			0
the new @entity33 tool now has 14 @entity33 presets which can save considerable effort when hand - toning an image			0
the @entity33 presets shipping with @entity21 range from the cartoonish to the fairly realistic , and should satisfy all but the pickiest of @entity33 enthusiasts			1
composing a real @entity33 image requires multiple photos taken with multiple exposures , but now you can fake it			0
@entity137 has a new set of tools to create what @entity24 calls " single image @entity141			1
" the results will never quite match a true @entity33 with multiple images , but the new single image @entity33 toning dialog lets you get pretty close using just one file			0
also incredibly helpful for @entity33 fans is the new " remove ghosts " tool in the @entity33 dialog , which makes it simple to eliminate ghosting and artifacts caused by differences between your layered @entity33 images			0
with @entity31 , you can simply outline a ghosted area ( say , for example , a flower that moved in the breeze between shots ) and select a single layer for the portion of the image			1
@entity137 is n't just new brushes			0
there 's been plenty of attention to performance -- the @entity174 version is now fully 64 - bit native , the same enhancement the @entity178 version got in in @entity179			0
that means that you could , in theory , throw as much as 128 gb ram at @entity21			0
this update further deepens @entity186 's integration with @entity187 , @entity24 's file browsing tool			0
bridge can now be embedded in a palette within @entity21 ( known as @entity187 )			0
you can quickly navigate through your images using the familiar bridge interface without needing to leave @entity21			0
interestingly , the @entity195 metaphor for @entity187 seems influenced by the @entity196 -- when you navigate through folders , the interface slides left and right			0
@entity137 also gets the same massive overhaul to the @entity201 engine that we 've seen in the forthcoming @entity203			0
camera raw in both apps offers much better sharpening and noise reduction , which is impressive not so much for its ability to remove noise , but to retain detail while doing so			1
@entity137 also has a few tricks designed to make designers ' lives easier , particularly the new puppet warp tools , which allow you to make path - like selections and bend , warp , shorten , lengthen and twist an object			1
@entity0 was shown a demo by @entity186 product manager @entity220			0
he took an image of an elephant with a straight trunk and , with just three selection points , he bent and curled the trunk back so the elephant appeared to be eating			0
@entity227 introduced almost no distortion into the finished image			0
@entity227 also provides a much easier and faster way to straighten tilted horizons			0
we were also impressed with the new @entity234 tool , which fixes distortion and other lens artifacts using profiles tailored to correct specific camera lenses ( the lens type is determined by embedded @entity241 data , so @entity21 can determine that automatically )			0
most of the other smaller features that make this release of @entity21 a must - have are user - suggested features and workflow improvements			0
@entity24 solicited user suggestions , filtered through the ideas , picking some three dozen ideas and making them a part of @entity31			1
photoshop has several outstanding new features -- it 's probably worth the price of the upgrade just for the new content aware fill tool , the 64 - bit boost and the improvements to @entity201 -- but what really sells this release is amount of time it promises to save you			0
among our favorites workflow improvements : you can now adjust the opacity and fill percentages on multiple layers simultaneously ; the save for web dialog is available in 16 - bit mode ( and handles downsizing to 8 - bit automatically ) ; and @entity21 has the ability to save layer styles as a default behavior that even persists across sessions			1
@entity24 has done an impressive job of focusing not just on the whiz - bang features , but on how photographers , designers and digital artists spend their time using @entity21 , and how making small changes can speed up their workflows			1
