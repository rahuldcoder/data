and both have personal connections to bipolar disorder ( @entity1 's sister , like @entity4 , suffers from the condition )			1
@entity1 has penned some of the series most acclaimed and talked about episodes , including season one 's " @entity19 , " where @entity22 ( @entity21 ) and @entity4 go to her cabin in the woods , and season two 's " @entity25 , " in which @entity4 finally arrests @entity22			1
" i did n't come in until like episode 4 , " says @entity1			1
" [ @entity28 and @entity29 ] created the character and the show			0
around episode 4 , they realized that there were all male writers and they had a female lead so they wanted a female writer			2
" adds @entity38 , " she 's really incredible			0
her voice is so distinctive and so honest and funny			0
she has a very wry sensibility that 's so in keeping with who @entity4 is			1
but she also is very warm and feeling and all of that translates into all her work			0
i owe an enormous amount to @entity1			1
" @entity50 's ' @entity49 ' : hear it but now there 's a chance that " @entity5 " could be losing the talented writer			2
@entity1 has a much - buzzed - about pilot with fx called " @entity57 " about a dead body found on a bridge between @entity60 and @entity61 ( it 's a remake of a @entity64 series of the same name )			1
if the pilot , starring @entity68 ( @entity69 ) and @entity70 ( @entity71 ) , goes to series , it 's likely that @entity1 will also leave the @entity9 series			1
" it 's a high - cost problem , " admits the writer			1
" it 's so hard to get your own series			2
but , at the same time , what kind of idiot leaves @entity5 right now ? " @entity81 falls short of ratings record @entity38 admits that she 's not looking forward to potentially saying goodbye			0
says the @entity85 - winning actress , " i 'm worried because i adore her and i think her talent is rare			2
she 's been crucial in defining who this person is			0
i 'm sure there are other brilliant women out there who could contribute wonderful things but i just like her ! she asked me to talk to @entity68 about my experience working in television and hopefully encourage her to accept the role			0
and i talked to her for about an hour and was really selling her on it			0
i thought , ' wait a minuteâ € ” what did i just do ? ' i love @entity1 and i support her totally but of course i do n't want her to go anywhere			2
