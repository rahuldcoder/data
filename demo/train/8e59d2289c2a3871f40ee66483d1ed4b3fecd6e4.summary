-- in the cut throat world of big - time ocean racing , giant maxis are the undoubted leaders of the pack			2
slicing through the water at 30 knots and more , vast distances can be covered in a few short days			0
but that speed comes at the price of severe discomfort for those getting the maximum out of the high tech 100 foot - plus yachts			2
" this is a very aggressive world			0
it 's banging , really noisy and with each wave you have the feeling you could break a bone , " sailing legend @entity17 told @entity0 's @entity18			1
and 54 - year - old @entity23 @entity17 should know			1
he skippered @entity24 on its record - breaking circumnavigation of the world , a 29,000 miles non-stop journey , completed in just 45 days 13 hours and 42 minutes			1
set in 2012 and landing the coveted @entity28 -- @entity17 's elder brother @entity29 was a twice former holder of award -- the time slashed over two days off the former record and set an incredible average speed of 26.51 knots for the entire trip			1
but @entity17 also had assistance from 13 other crew members during their helterskelter trip around the world , which earned them personal congratulations from then @entity23 president @entity43			1
taking part in solo efforts at the helm of such imposing yachts requires a different level of intestinal fortitude , fitness and raw courage altogether			0
@entity17 knew only to well of the dangers when asked at very short notice to replace an injured compatriot , @entity55 , in the most prestigious of all single - handed transatlantic races			1
not only that , the last time @entity17 had competed in the @entity57 in 2002 he had to abandon when his 69ft trimaran @entity59 broke up in a " big , big , big storm " in the @entity61 and he was rescued from the wreckage by a ship			1
in fact , in six previous attempts dating back 32 years , @entity17 's best finish was fifth and he had given up hope of landing one of the only prizes to elude him in his illustrious career			1
and then there was his age to consider , given the physical demands			0
admittedly , he 's no " spring chicken , " so when @entity76 , the boss of the @entity24 team , asked him the question , @entity17 's first response was an emphatic " non			1
" " i was not dreaming any more about doing another transatlantic ( race ) alone on a boat able to win it , " he said			2
" that was the end of my dream			0
" @entity17 , who is a key member of the @entity86 @entity85 team @entity87 , had intended to compete in the @entity57 on a " little yellow trimaran " -- content to let @entity55 bid for line honors with the favored @entity92 but all that changed when @entity55 injured his hand two months ahead of the challenge			1
@entity76 had total faith in the record breaking @entity17 to be the perfect substitute , given his vast experience , but there was another factor which left the coveted skipper with so much doubt			1
the prospect of the lack of sleep for several days and fear of losing control of the 103 - foot trimaran			1
" falling asleep it 's really hard , " he said			0
" a boat like that could capsize in a few seconds , as we all know			0
the average speed is something like 30 knots or whatever			0
" i 'm supposed to be able to have a rest , you close your eyes , you keep the main sheet in your hand like that and you pray ! " @entity76 implored him to think again about his decision , but it was @entity17 's wife @entity127 who urged him to put aside his fears			1
after a night spent at sea alone -- " feeding the two columns , the positive and the negative one " -- his mind was made up			0
he would make one final attempt to win the @entity57			2
two months of intensive training followed , helped by @entity55 , and on november 2 the 10th edition of the famous event got underway from @entity137 in @entity23 , the fleet heading to @entity139			0
and as the race transpired , @entity17 's fears about being able to handle the boat and conditions proved gloriously unfounded			1
he led from the first night and after 3,542 nautical miles , he crossed the finish line in seven days , 15 hours , eight minutes and 32 seconds , comfortably a new race record			1
" i never imagined that i would win a @entity57 on a boat like this , " @entity17 said at the finish			1
but he admitted that throughout the race he was constantly on edge and his fears over falling asleep and losing control nearly came back to haunt him			2
" i was able to sail the boat well but was scared , " he told the official @entity154 website			0
" you have to constantly manage the boat			0
one night i fell asleep at the helm and nearly capsized the boat			0
" it was his 49th @entity161 crossing -- 18 of them solo -- accomplished at an average speed of over 22 knots -- and given his doubts , very special			0
" this is a great victory ; possibly one of the nicest and breaking the record is the cherry on top of the cake , " he added			2
@entity17 , " with brilliant stories to tell , " according to @entity154 team boss @entity176 , will now return to his day job of helping the syndicate win the 35th @entity85 in 2017			2
the team is based in @entity178 -- preparing for the racing in @entity180 where it will compete with others in the @entity183 , with the winner of that series facing holders @entity186 for the biggest prize in yachting			0
the team is chock full of former @entity191 champions from all classes , plus sailors with previous experience of @entity195 , including @entity17			2
he was at the helm with the @entity198 challenge @entity199 in 2010 and joined up with @entity87 just before the 2013 edition , which ended with defeat to the @entity203 @entity202			2
with that experience behind it , @entity87 will be hoping to up its game in 2017 , but the syndicate was hit by tragedy last year when former @entity210 olympic gold medalist @entity209 died while training with the team in @entity212			1
@entity213 , 36 , drowned after their catamaran capsized , leaving him trapped underneath for over 10 minutes			0
he had paired with @entity176 to win the @entity216 at the @entity217 and silver on home waters at the @entity220 of 2012			0
@entity213 , nicknamed " @entity209 " after the tv character , had a foundation formed in his memory and earlier this year it held its first event			0
@entity17 was among a number of sailing greats to support @entity227 , which saw over 700 sailing clubs from 68 different countries stage their own race over a standard distance to set a new @entity232 for mass participation			1
@entity213 will surely stay in the thoughts of @entity176 and his @entity154 team as it eyes the ultimate prize in the sport			0
@entity17 had been totally focused on the @entity85 bid before being handed an unexpected opportunity to resume his solo career and he proved he is not a man to let a challenge pass , however daunting			1
" when you know that it 's part of your life to do this sort of challenge , this crazy challenge , it 's normal , " he said .			0
