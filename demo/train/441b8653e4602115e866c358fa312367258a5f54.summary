-- at every election , @entity2 's ballot is filled with initiatives , but none received more attention this year than @entity7			1
after the polls closed , @entity7 -- also known as the " right to know " initiative to require labeling of foods that have been genetically modified -- failed to pass			1
if approved , @entity2 would have been the first state to require such labeling for foods sold in the state , and would have prohibited products containing genetically modified ingredients to be labeled or marketed as " natural			1
" although the issue was ostensibly about food , the debate over @entity7 quickly became political in recent months , with grassroots - based food purists supporting the measure and a well - funded agriculture and industry opposition campaigning against its passage			1
as the @entity29 reports , prop			0
37 opponents , largely from industry and agriculture , raised over $ 45 million while the @entity33 campaign , which was largely backed by consumer groups and the organic industry , raised about $ 6.7 million			1
37 : why @entity2 's ballot initiative on @entity39 food is about politics more than science " we 've said from the beginning of this campaign that the more voters learned about @entity7 , the less they 'd like it			1
we did n't think they 'd like the lawsuits , more bureaucracy , higher costs and loopholes and exemptions			0
it looks like they do n't , " the @entity54			0
37 spokeswoman @entity57 told the @entity58			0
@entity60 37 supporters argued that citizens have the right to know what 's in their food and make educated decisions on what to feed their families , especially since long - term health effects are hazy			1
they wanted to see labeling , according to the ballot initiative , either on the front or back of packages " if the food is made from plants or animals with genetic material changed in specified ways			1
" opponents from the biotech industry and @entity81 companies like @entity82 called the labeling deceptive and argued it would stigmatize foods that scientific evidence shows is not harmful			1
they also estimated that the cost of the labeling requirement would trickle down to @entity2 households , forcing families to pay $ 400 more in grocery bills each year			0
as @entity96 's @entity95 noted , however , that figure , which became a highly debated part of the campaign , assumes manufacturers would be replacing currently unlabeled genetically modified ( @entity39 ) products rather than slapping new labels on them			1
@entity0 : making sense of food labels in the end , however , public health experts hope that it was the science that helped voters to make their decision			2
so far , there is little evidence suggesting that @entity39 foods pose any harms to people that would warrant a label informing them of the modification			1
major medical groups like the @entity117 and the @entity118 , in addition to the @entity120 note that people have been eating genetically modified foods ( about 85 % of corn sold in the @entity123 are man - made hybrids ) for nearly 20 years with no serious adverse effects			2
so what is the push for labeling really about ? in @entity2 in particular , it may be about a new - found appreciation for issues that many of us take for granted , including sustainable farming and animal rights			0
opinion : kids take up fight for ' real food ' in the @entity140 , writer @entity139 says the movement has " revitalized local farming and urban communities and at the same time raised the bar on the food industry , which now must pay attention ( or at least lip service ) to things like sustainable farming and the humane treatment of animals			2
" he also admits the movement still has hurdles before it can establish itself as a campaign that will appeal to enough people to pass as a ballot initiative			0
but despite the defeat , the @entity7 supporters see the campaign as a victory of sorts			1
" @entity7 is a really important and historic opportunity for an emerging food movement			1
it will fundamentally change the conversation about food and agriculture here in the @entity123 , " says @entity163 , founder of @entity164			2
" it will also change how food companies have to respond to the millions and millions of @entity123 across the country who want to know what they 're eating			2
" @entity0 : vital farms : raising the ultra-organic egg @entity163 says the campaign has highlighted @entity123 ' increasing distrust of the food industry and the lack of transparency surrounding what goes into the food they eat			2
given that 50 countries already label @entity39 foods in @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 , he hopes @entity123 skepticism will continue to hold food manufacturers accountable			1
" we have a massive social movement for change to achieve labeling of genetically engineered foods in the @entity123			2
we understand that [ this ] loss ... that 's politics			0
the largest , most powerful corporations have spent millions of dollars to deceive the @entity2 voters , " he says			0
more states will consider labeling laws in coming years , and @entity208 and @entity209 will likely have ballot propositions in the next two years			0
" we will go to @entity208 and demand labeling from the next administration			0
we are not going away			0
we are just getting started , " says @entity163			0
