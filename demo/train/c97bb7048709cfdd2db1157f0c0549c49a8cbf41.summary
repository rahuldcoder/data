@entity0 -- an @entity3 delegation has been ordered home from talks in @entity7 aimed at ending the conflict in @entity0 , a senior @entity3 official said tuesday , shortly after the @entity3 military blamed militants in @entity0 for breaking a truce			1
@entity13 negotiators placed the blame for the lack of progress in the talks on the @entity3			0
" the @entity3 delegation is still trying to impose ( upon us ) what they want , and this would be impossible for us to accept as @entity13 , " said @entity18 , head of the @entity13 negotiators			0
the @entity13 introduced their latest position to @entity25 and @entity3 negotiators on tuesday , and are awaiting a response , @entity18 said			0
by late tuesday , the armed wing of @entity28 -- the @entity27 -- said on its website that it had fired 29 rockets into @entity3 in 20 minutes			1
the @entity32 , in response , launched airstrikes and ordered bomb shelters open within a 40 - to 80 - kilometer range of @entity0			0
at least three people , including one infant , have been killed , and 52 people have been injured since the breakdown of the ceasefire , according to the @entity41 in @entity0			1
as rocket attacks and airstrikes resumed , one interpretation of the @entity3 leaving @entity7 was that they had given up on negotiations			2
another @entity13 leader , @entity46 , looked at it another way , saying the @entity3 took the newest proposal home with them to share with their government			0
" the chances of an agreement are very slim , and the situation is very difficult , " he said			0
in the talks , @entity3 was calling for @entity0 to be demilitarized , demanding that @entity28 , which controls the territory , and other militant groups lay down their arms			1
@entity46 said monday that the group 's weapons were " for self - defense " against @entity3			2
" but when we have our own @entity13 state with its own national army to protect its citizens , there will be no need for any party to carry any kind of weapons , " he said			0
@entity13 say @entity3 's blockade is throttling the economy of the small , impoverished strip of land and the lives of its inhabitants			2
among their demands are the rebuilding and reopening of @entity0 's airport and the establishment of a seaport			0
but @entity3 authorities -- who retain control of @entity0 's airspace , @entity88 waters and their shared border -- say releasing their grip on what goes into and out of the territory is n't feasible while @entity28 and other groups are still building up their arsenals of weapons			1
cease - fire unravels the rocket fire came only hours after the ceasefire was extended until the end of the day , as @entity13 and @entity3 negotiators , struggling to reach a more lasting agreement , reported little progress			1
@entity3 prime minister @entity104 ordered the @entity32 to respond to the rockets , a senior @entity3 official told @entity1			1
an @entity32 statement shortly afterward said strikes were being carried out against targets in @entity0			0
nine palestinians , including three children , were wounded in an @entity3 airstrike in @entity114 , @entity109 , spokesman for the @entity110 in @entity0 , told @entity1			2
@entity115 reported airstrikes in northern and central @entity0 , as well			0
the @entity117 condemned the renewed rocket attacks , with a @entity120 official reiterating the @entity117 position that @entity3 has a right to defend itself against such attacks			1
" we hope that the parties can reach an agreement on a sustainable ceasefire , or if necessary , agree to yet another extension of their temporary ceasefire so they can continue in conversations , " @entity124 , deputy spokeswoman , said			0
" but as of right now , today 's developments , we are very concerned about and it is our understanding that ... the ceasefire has broken down			2
" @entity28 blames @entity3 a thick plume of smoke could be seen rising from a building in southern @entity0 apparently hit by an @entity3 airstrike			1
a @entity1 team on the ground also saw earlier what appeared to be three rockets being fired from @entity0 into @entity3 , leaving smoke trails in the sky			1
shortly before the rockets were launched , @entity28 spokesman @entity147 said in an e-mailed statement to @entity1 : " if @entity104 does not understand our message and people 's demands in @entity0 through political language , we know a way to make him understand			1
" a banner on the @entity28 - run @entity115 blamed @entity3 for violating the truce			2
the conflict , which began in early july , has killed more than 2,000 palestinians , leaving entire @entity0 neighborhoods in rubble			0
the violence has killed 67 people on the @entity3 side , with militants in @entity0 firing roughly 3,500 rockets toward @entity3			1
@entity1 's @entity167 reported from @entity0 , @entity168 reported and wrote from @entity169 , and @entity170 wrote in @entity171			2
@entity1 's @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 contributed to this report .			0
