a 29 - year - old woman , remembered by her mother for her " heart of gold			1
" a @entity4 graduate student from @entity5 who 'd gone to enjoy the marathon 's finish with two classmates			1
an 8 - year - old boy , cheering on runners with his family			1
all of them , gone			2
their lives were snuffed out by twin blasts at the tail end of monday 's @entity17			1
thirteen others -- out of 183 hospitalized -- had limbs amputated , according to hospital officials			2
the question is : why ? the victims : promising lives lost in tragedy more than a day later , authorities do n't have an answer			1
unlike after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , no one claimed responsibility for this terrorist attack			1
no one had been identified as a suspect			2
the attack came out of nowhere , with no threat			1
as @entity39 , the special agent in charge of the @entity43 's @entity42 office , put it tuesday afternoon : " the range of suspects and motives remains wide open			1
" the two identical pressure - cooker bombs -- each with the capacity to hold six liters of liquid , according to a @entity42 law enforcement source -- blew up seconds and a short distance apart on @entity42 's @entity52			1
they contained bb - like pellets and nails , the @entity43 's @entity53 said , causing even more damage			1
photos obtained by @entity58 , which were in a bulletin sent to federal law enforcement agencies , showed parts of a pressure cooker , a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings			1
such evidence -- including a partial circuit board -- are headed to an @entity43 facility in @entity70 , @entity71 , where authorities will try to determine how the devices worked and cull out clues identifying the person or persons responsible			1
more on the investigation into the bombings whatever investigators find , whenever they find it , it wo n't take away the pain			1
scores who are not grieving loved ones are faced with a lengthy physical recovery			1
there 's the psychological battle as well -- living with the memories of the deafening blasts , the carnage , the fear as they searched for loved ones			1
@entity94 was one of them			2
one second , he was laughing and smiling			2
the next second , there was a roaring blast , originating from about 10 feet away , and he looked down to see a " puddle of blood			2
" he later discovered a " chunk of the leg was just not there			2
" his wife was hospitalized , too , and a friend lost both her legs			0
@entity94 told @entity58 's @entity107 he is angry			0
but he 's also not about to let this terror change him , any more than it already has			0
" you ca n't let people control your life like that , " @entity94 said from his hospital bed			1
" you just ca n't			1
" hundreds run toward carnage to help the pressure wave from monday 's explosions in @entity42 's historic @entity119 whipped the once limp international flags straight out , as if they were caught in a hurricane			1
some runners said they thought the first blast was a celebratory cannon			0
by the second , there were no such illusions			0
the scene on the ground was sheer horror			0
blood and unconscious people were everywhere			0
so , too , were people who went to help			0
@entity42 heroes run to help some were spectators , like @entity135			0
an affiliate of the @entity138 , he tended to a man who 'd lost two of his limbs			0
dr. @entity142 , a pediatric resident at @entity143 , was near the home stretch of the race she was running with her father when she heard the blasts			1
despite having run 26 miles , she went over barriers and past policemen , until one stopped her			0
@entity142 told @entity58 she told him she was a doctor and pleaded , " you have to let me help , you have to let me through			0
" she said she performed cpr on the first person she encountered			0
for the next two , she worked to halt their bleeding			0
@entity142 stressed that there were hundreds of others doing whatever they could			0
it was the worst thing i 've ever seen , " @entity142 said			0
" nails , metal beads found in patients while authorities have given no indication they know who was behind the attack , they have offered details on the devices used			1
@entity53 , from the @entity43 , said the bombs were possibly placed in pressure cookers hidden inside a backpack or another black nylon bag			1
another law enforcement official told @entity58 it was " likely but not certain " the bombs were on a timer , not set off remotely by a cell phone			0
experts see hallmarks of ' lone wolf ' devices another federal law enforcement official said both bombs were small , and initial tests showed no @entity186 or other high - grade explosive , suggesting the materials used in the attack were crude			1
those killed include 8 - year - old @entity190 , a resident of the city 's @entity192 neighborhood whom babysitter @entity194 recalled as " just all - around a wonderful kid ( with ) a big , bright smile that no one could ever forget			1
" there was 29 - year - old @entity201 , who was " fun , outgoing ( and ) always there to help somebody , " her grandmother @entity199 said			1
lastly , there was the @entity4 graduate student from @entity5 -- whom the school and @entity5 consulate declined to identify by name			1
according to a @entity212 profile , she graduated from a @entity5 university with a degree in international economics and was set to earn her master 's degree in mathematics and statistics in 2014 from @entity4 others survived , thanks largely to the work of emergency personnel and volunteers on - site and scores of professionals in several world - class hospitals nearby			1
doctors removed more than a dozen nails from one patient , and three had been struck with metal beads slightly larger than bbs , said dr. @entity232 , the emergency medicine chairman at @entity233			0
back in @entity119 , in the heart of @entity42 , investigators on tuesday continued searching for any hint that might lead them to the perpetrator			0
authorities also pleaded for the public 's help			2
did they know of anyone who made a threat involving april 15 or the marathon ? did they hear explosions in a remote area , possibly as a test run ? and did they spot anyone near the finish line dropping off what ended up being the two bombs ? @entity255 calls attack ' terror ' by 5 p.m. tuesday , the @entity43 had gotten more than 2,000 tips , @entity39 said			2
they 'd also begun poring over scores of photos and videos from the scene			1
" we are doing this methodically , " he said , " ... and with a sense of urgency			0
" mayor : ' we will not let terror take us over ' at one point , 11 @entity42 - area hospitals had 23 people in critical condition and 40 listed as serious			2
there are still some fighting , with more surgeries planned			0
in fact , according to a @entity58 tally , at least 100 of the 183 people who received treatment were able to go home by tuesday night			0
how @entity42 and @entity283 recovers over the coming days , weeks and months remains to be seen			0
as has happened before after such terror attacks , tuesday saw authorities responding to alerts and threats -- in places like @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity291 -- that all proved to be unfounded			2
security in @entity294 and @entity291 has been stepped up in light of the @entity42 attack , and authorities in @entity298 are reviewing measures for that city 's upcoming marathon			1
back in @entity303 , one question is what becomes of the @entity17 -- the world 's oldest annual marathon , dating to 1897 , drawing more than 20,000 participants			0
rather than shutting it down , officials promised to build the race back up			0
" next year 's marathon will be even bigger and better , " gov. @entity312			2
that sense of defiance was echoed by mayor @entity315			0
residents and visitors to the city might have to deal with more checks at transit stations and elsewhere			0
they might have to get used to seeing more authorities out and about			2
but they should n't change their attitudes , said the mayor			2
" this tragedy is not going to stop @entity42 , " @entity315 said			0
" we will not let terror take us over			0

photos shows parts of a pressure cooker , backpack and pellets
an 8 - year - old boy , 29 - year - old woman and grad student from @entity5 die
scores more are injured in the twin blasts , helped by medical staff and others
