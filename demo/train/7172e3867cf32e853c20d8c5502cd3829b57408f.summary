-- at the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the passage of the @entity5 , four presidents remembered the battles and honored those who fought to form " a more perfect union " on the path to economic , educational and voting equality			1
but , for one of those heroes , it was also a time to pause and acknowledge the progress			2
and for one president , it was a time to honor another			2
the four presidents -- @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 -- led the observances , appropriately , at the @entity22 in @entity23			1
it was president @entity25 who in 1964 secured the passage of the @entity5 , and in 1965 , the @entity28 -- the latter eviscerated last year by the @entity30			1
president @entity20 thanked " the warriors for justice , the elected officials and community leaders who are here today			1
" those who ended segregation and ushered in the most significant change in @entity37 since the @entity38 were indeed , " warriors for justice			1
" one of the warriors present was rep. @entity40 who was in his 20s when the battles for @entity43 were raging across the @entity44 , and indeed , all @entity37			2
@entity40 was attacked dozens of times			2
the bus he was riding was firebombed in @entity47 , @entity48			0
he suffered a fractured skull from a policeman 's club on the @entity52 and was beaten unconscious in a @entity54 bus station			0
it was men and women warriors like @entity40 who first moved @entity58 , and then moved the federal government , to guarantee the basic human rights they demanded			1
the rights were as simple as ordering a sandwich and drink at a lunch counter , and as profound as being able to vote			2
introducing the president , @entity40 said , " president @entity20 was born into a dangerous and difficult time in @entity37 history , a time when people were arrested and taken to jail just for sitting beside each other on the bus			1
" " when people say nothing has changed , i say come and walk in my shoes , and i will show you change			0
" president @entity20 keyed his theme to honor president @entity25			1
" because of the civil rights movement , because of the laws that @entity25 passed , new doors swung open , " he said			1
" i have lived out the promise of @entity25 's efforts			1
... @entity83 has lived out the legacy of those efforts			0
... my daughters have lived out the legacy of those efforts			0
" doors swung open , @entity20 said , " not all at once , but they swung open			1
not just ( for ) blacks and whites , but also women and @entity91 ; and @entity92 and @entity58			0
" " in a time when cynicism is too often passed off as wisdom , it 's perhaps easy to conclude that there are limits to change ; that we are trapped by our own history ; and politics is a fool 's errand , " he said , adding , " i reject such cynicism			0
" we " can not be complacent , " he said			0
" our rights , our freedoms -- they are not given			2
" @entity20 added , " we remain locked in this same great debate about equality and opportunity			1
" earlier in the week , former president @entity17 struck a similar theme : " we still have gross disparity between black and white people on employment ( and ) the quality of education , " said @entity17			2
" but we feel like , you know , @entity25 did it -- we do n't have to do anything anymore			1
i think too many people are at ease with the still existing disparity			0
" former president @entity19 , who spoke at the conclusion of the @entity127 said , " i fear that the soft bigotry of low expectations is returning , and for the sake of @entity37 's children , that is something we can not allow			2
" former president @entity18 homed in on the erosion of the @entity28 , and partisan divisions			2
" we all know what this is about : this is a way of restricting the franchise after 50 years of expanding it , " @entity18 said			0
" is this what @entity140 gave his life for ? is this what @entity25 employed his legendary skills for ? " he asked			1
" i am concerned that on this 50th anniversary , these divisions and the lack of a spirit of coming together put us back in the dustbin of old history , " @entity18 said			1
@entity20 echoed @entity18 , saying , " one concern i have sometimes during these moments ( is that ) from a distance , sometimes ... they seem easy			1
all the pain and difficulty and struggle and doubt -- all that is rubbed away			0
" @entity19 reminded the audience about the importance of education in ensuring equality for all			0
" it is not a coincidence that many of the defining struggles of the civil rights era -- from @entity171 to the @entity172 -- took place in educational settings			1
those who engage in oppression and exploitation always deny real learning			0
those who fight oppression always insist on equal education			0
through civil rights laws , we assure justice in the present			1
through education , we secure justice for the next generation			2
" there is still more work to do			0
more work by my generation , which includes the president			2
and more work by those coming up now			0
@entity20 exhorted young people especially not to succumb to despair or cynicism because the struggle seems too hard			1
" we 've got a debt to pay , " he said			0
president @entity25 " believed that together we can build an @entity37 that is more fair , more equal , and more free than the one we inherited			1
he believed we make our own destiny			0
and in part because of him , we must believe it as well			0
" if we still believe , we shall overcome one day			0
join us on @entity204 / @entity203 .			0
