apparently working under the impression that they understand the science of sexuality better than the @entity5 or the @entity6 or psychological or @entity8 associations , @entity1 @entity0 made a bold statement last weekend			1
with zero debate , they adopted a party platform that includes support for a widely discredited form of mental health " treatment " known as " reparative therapy			1
" also called " conversion therapy , " this dangerous pseudo-medical practice aimed at transforming homosexuals into heterosexuals has been widely demonstrated to be both ineffective and harmful , not to mention offensive			1
the clearly misguided assumption underlying such therapy is the belief ( often reinforced by self - serving interpretations of any number of religious texts ) that homosexuality is a disease			2
however , much like @entity30 ( the pseudo-scientific " disease " an enterprising white man conveniently identified in the mid- 19th century was described as the condition that led black slaves to attempt escape ) , homosexuality is in fact not an illness , but rather a fact of human nature			2
and rejecting human nature can have devastating effects on the psyche , demonstrating that if there is a real disease that needs fixing here , it 's homophobia , not homosexuality			0
lesbian , gay and bisexual youth experience significantly increased risk for suicide than their heterosexual peers			0
in fact , as cited by the @entity54 , a nonprofit organization that provides @entity53 youth with crisis intervention and suicide prevention services , @entity53 youth are four times more likely than their heterosexual peers to attempt suicide , and their attempts are four to six times more likely to result in injuries that require medical attention			0
moreover , @entity53 youth from highly unsupportive families ( like the kinds that would be drawn to conversion therapy ) are more than eight times more likely to have attempted suicide as those from more accepting and supportive households			2
recognizing this , both @entity75 and @entity76 have banned conversion therapy for minors , and other states are considering similar initiatives			1
by explicitly supporting such pseudo-therapy , the @entity81 has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self - hatred that such " treatments " reinforce			1
it has reminded us just how out of touch the @entity1 @entity81 can be — not only regarding modern medicine , but also with respect to the future of their own party			1
according to the @entity99 , 61 % of @entity0 under 30 support same - sex marriage			0
that 's only 1 percentage point less than that of democrats over the age of 65 who support it			0
in short , the dinosaurs behind embarrassing and discriminatory platforms like this are guaranteeing their own extinction by clinging onto closed - minded convictions that are clearly on the way out			0
as it turns out , some of the most seemingly anti-gay individuals are in fact responding to an internalized homophobia in conflict with their own homosexuality			0
keeping this and the aforementioned statistics in mind , i propose that @entity1 @entity0 step into the 21st century by adopting a different kind of conversion therapy — namely , one that replaces fear and bigotry with knowledge , acceptance and respect .			2

@entity81 endorsed " reparative therapy " to convert gays to straight *orientation*
@entity140 says such therapy is *n't* recognized by legitimate science
she says two states have banned the therapy for minors
@entity140 : young *republicans* are going to be *repelled* by such *decisions*
