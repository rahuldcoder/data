-- just over a year ago , a @entity2 staff sergeant in @entity3 decided to practice his shooting skills			1
his target : the @entity6 , @entity8 's holiest book			2
pvt. @entity9 , 20 , learns cultural awareness by watching an interactive dvd			1
the military issued a formal apology , promptly dismissed the soldier from his regiment and reassigned him to stateside duty			2
but news of the shooting had already made its way onto @entity20 , and a firestorm of outrage was ignited across the @entity8 world			0
protests turned deadly in @entity25			1
back at the @entity28 's @entity27 at @entity29 , @entity30 , commanders knew they had a problem			1
in the 21st century , the @entity28 was sending younger soldiers into an arena they had little cultural experience in , and at the same time , new social networking sites were poised to broadcast their mistakes to the world			1
maj. gen. @entity38 , the leading officer at @entity29 , knew that the @entity28 not only needed trained linguists , but it also needed a new language of its own			1
" the advent of social networking has changed the world			0
the soldiers who i see coming from basic to the intel center , what is the first question they ask ? ' are you @entity48 ? ' , " he said			1
today , a third of the men and women the @entity28 has deployed in @entity3 and @entity25 are between the ages of 20 and 24 , and @entity38 believes the military has now entered the age of the " strategic private " -- a young soldier reared on video games			1
and because of social networking , that private is now armed with the ability to severely cripple a mission and spark the kinds of reactions that the world saw after the @entity6 shooting			0
so @entity38 decided his young recruits needed some extra training in cultural awareness			1
for help , he turned to a group of former military men who also saw an opportunity to engage today 's @entity3 - bound soldiers			1
@entity75 spent a career in the @entity77 before starting a @entity79 , @entity80 - based company called @entity81 , which combines live - action video and virtual - reality technology to create simulators that become learning tools for the military and other clients			0
" i was watching the rise of the gaming world , and the impact and the power it was having over how people were interacting with information , and i thought there is something here , " @entity88 said			0
so @entity88 , a trained @entity98 linguist , worked with two other companies , @entity99 , to help him create realistic , movie - like combat scenarios			1
@entity103 veterans shot the scenarios on an elaborate set in @entity106 , adding real footage from @entity3 whenever possible			1
the result : an immersive cultural simulation program that is part video game , part blockbuster @entity103 movie			1
soldiers use computers to train on an interactive dvd that plunges them into a series of scenarios and presents them with choices , such as whether to accept a cooler full of drinks from an @entity3 youth			1
at the end of each scenario , the recruit clicks on his or her choice , then discovers whether it was the right one			0
( @entity129 : that cooler could contain a bomb			0
) in this way , the dvd becomes an immersive learning tool that trains soldiers in a way that lectures and textbooks can not			1
@entity138 , an @entity139 turned @entity103 guru , is the project 's executive producer			0
he 's convinced that by grabbing soldiers ' attention with stunning graphics and compelling characters , and then engaging them in the decision - making process , the project will deliver the ultimate payoff			2
" they 're gon na live , " he told @entity0			0
" they 're gon na make choices on the battlefield that will prevent their first choice from being to use their weapon			2
they 're gon na use their mind			0
" @entity138 believes the simulator program is more effective then a traditional video game because soldiers relate more to human characters than virtual avatars			2
" nobody cares about an avatar that gets killed			0
you just get another avatar , " he said			0
" it 's a ' band of brothers ' mentality , " agreed @entity170 , chief of training at @entity29			2
" you are building a camaraderie			0
" @entity170 hopes that the soldiers build enough of a bond with the characters onscreen that they will be able to sense the shock and stress that come with the life - or - death situations they 'll soon be immersed in for real			2
but can a soldier really save a life , or multiple lives , just by using more cultural sensitivity ? does it really matter if a @entity2 soldier knows the difference between a @entity190 and a @entity191 ? @entity38 thinks so			1
" if an untrained soldier walks through a market , he 's gon na come back and tell you ' there are a lot of tomatoes here today , ' " @entity38 said			0
" the guy who has cultural training is gon na come back and say , ' all the @entity191 in the market are talking about @entity202 , a meeting tonight			1
' " pvt. @entity9 , 20 , who does n't know yet when she 'll be deployed , has found the training useful			2
" i 'm going to be a little more aware of what i 'm looking for , the people and the environment , " she said			0
spc. @entity208 , 23 , who grew up playing video games , agrees			0
" the format was a little bit different from most video games i 've seen			0
it was intuitive , " he said			0
" i thought this training was a significant step forward			2
" every soldier who takes the @entity218 immersion course is given a pre- and post-training test to measure the change in their cultural acuity			2
but there is an even more immediate feedback about whether the @entity28 has achieved its mission of connecting with its young soldiers			1
" if it were a video game , i 'd buy it , " @entity208 said .			0

the @entity28 is using interactive videos for soldiers ' cultural sensitivity training
the videos help recruits understand and adapt to @entity3 and @entity25
soldiers watch dvds that plunge them into a series of *wartime* scenarios
recruits face choices , click on options , then find out how they scored
