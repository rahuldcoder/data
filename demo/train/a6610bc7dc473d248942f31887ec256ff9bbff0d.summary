@entity0 -- when i was informed last year by police that my phone had been hacked by @entity5 , i was very angry , but not altogether surprised			1
i was by then all too familiar with the way that tabloid newspapers thought nothing of invading my privacy , if they thought there might be a story in it			0
i am best known in the @entity13 as a presenter on the @entity16 tv show , " @entity21 , " a crime - fighting factual program , similar in purpose to @entity19 's " @entity20			1
" i was on " crimewatch " between 1990 and 2006 , but before , during and after my tv stint , i was also a detective with the @entity24			1
@entity25 : share your view on phone - hacking scandal			0
up until 2002 my experience of the press was generally positive			1
on " crimewatch , " i witnessed first hand the enormous benefits of working in partnership with the media to solve crime			0
that 's not to say there were n't times when the different agendas conflicted , but that has to be expected			0
that was all about to change			0
my then husband , a detective chief superintendent , appeared on " @entity21 " to appeal for information in the unsolved 1987 murder of private detective @entity46 , whose business partner @entity47 was alleged to have supplied @entity5 's parent company @entity48 with illegally obtained information			1
it was a gruesome case : a man killed with an ax outside a south @entity0 pub. soon after , the @entity24 received intelligence that suspects in the case intended to make life difficult for him			0
the @entity24 took the threat so seriously we were placed under the umbrella of the witness protection unit			0
@entity46 's business partner and two other men were eventually charged in the killing , but the murder case against the three collapsed last year and the charges were dropped			1
in 2002 " @entity21 " was sent an email suggesting that i was having an affair			1
strangers phoned my husband 's work , attempting to find out our home address and other personal and financial details			1
two vans stationed outside our house followed my husband taking the kids to school			2
by this stage , we feared we were being stalked by the people responsible for the murder			2
we took our house off the market , and warned our daughter 's headmistress of the risks of strangers hanging around the school			2
i became very distressed and anxious			0
the stress that we endured over the subsequent years contributed to the eventual breakdown of my marriage			1
the two vans were eventually traced back to the @entity5			1
the @entity24 sought an explanation from the newspaper about the surveillance and the reason given was simply unbelievable			2
they said that they were investigating suspicions that my husband and i were having an affair with each other ! we had by then been married for four years , together for 11 and had two children			1
our marriage was public knowledge -- we 'd even been pictured in @entity104			2
in 2011 , officers from @entity106 , a police investigation into phone hacking , informed me that private information about me , including home address , phone numbers and detailed history had been found in the notebooks of @entity115 , the private investigator who was jailed in 2007 for intercepting phone messages of members of the royal family			0
read a timeline of the hacking scandal in july 2012 , prosecutors said @entity115 would face four charges relating to the alleged hacking of the phones of murdered teenager @entity125 and three other people			2
he issued a statement denying the latest charges			0
the dates on the entries suggested that our phones were being hacked around the same time as the other surveillance was going on			2
you only have to listen to the stories coming out of the inquiry to know that this kind of harassment was n't restricted to @entity5			1
it was widespread across the industry			0
there was a culture that led some of the papers to behave as if the law did not apply to them			2
and they got away with it because of self regulation			0
in 2011 i gave evidence to the @entity152 inquiry into press ethics about our experiences			0
what i hope to see coming out of the inquiry is independent regulation , backed up by statute , that has genuine repercussions for anyone who starts to play fast and loose with the system again			0
i , and other victims of press harassment -- and i would like to stress that most of us are regular members of the public , not celebrities -- do n't want to have to go through this again in a few years ' time			1
this is an important moment in history , a chance to reassert a clean and accountable press that we can all be proud of again			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178			1
@entity1 asked @entity48 for comment on the allegations made by @entity178			1
it declined to comment .			0

tv presenter @entity178 says first experience of dealing with press was positive
that changed , she says , when her husband appeared on tv to appeal over a murder
@entity178 says strangers rang her husband at work ; email alleged she was having affair
surveillance traced to @entity5 , she says . stress led to her marriage ending
