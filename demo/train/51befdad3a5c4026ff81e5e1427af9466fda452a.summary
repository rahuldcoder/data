-- the @entity2 war has never been a simple fight between good rebels and evil government forces , and the @entity6 has said so several times in the past			1
but this week , @entity6 investigators released a particularly detailed and horrific report that slams both sides , accusing rebels fighting to oust president @entity13 of murder , rape , torture and forced disappearances			1
government forces and the rebels have violated international humanitarian law in the two - year war , said @entity22 , chairman of the @entity23 on @entity2			1

" the lengthy report is based on information from 443 interviews that @entity6 investigators conducted inside @entity2			2
one of the more disturbing passages details rebels and government forces recruiting boys as young as 12			1
children under 18 are seized at checkpoints , and government - affiliated militia use sectarian affiliation , kinship systems and cash to cajole children into their ranks , the paper notes			0
the government has used children as informants , but both they and rebels punish children who act as informants by killing them , the report says			1

the @entity2 government , meanwhile , has consistently blamed " armed terrorist groups " for killing civilians			2
while the regime has often referred to opposition fighters as " terrorists , " some radical militants -- such as members of the @entity119 -- have also joined the fight against the government			0
