-- when the winner of the women 's singles at the @entity5 picks up her check for $ 2.6 million -- buck for buck the same as the men 's champion -- she might well reflect that , if not for @entity14 's pioneering efforts , those riches might not exist			1
@entity16 champion on the court , battler for equality off it , @entity14 took on the male - dominated tennis establishment and won			1
she was the driving force behind the formation of the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) in 1973 , the same year she famously beat former men 's grand slam champion @entity24 in the " @entity27 " match in @entity29			1
" everybody should thank her and shake her hand , " @entity14 's fellow tennis icon @entity30 told @entity0 's @entity31			1
" she put money in our pockets and provided a living for hundreds and hundreds of female athletes			0
" @entity41 is the frontrunner in all sports in equality , so she deserves all of the credit			0
" 40th anniversary forty years on , @entity14 , who turns 70 in november , has been celebrating the @entity23 's anniversary in a series of events which defined the role of women not just in sport , but in society itself			1
the fledgling @entity55 tennis circuit for women professionals had been established at the start of the 1970s , but the leading players like @entity14 and @entity60 @entity59 -- the all - time leading grand slam singles winner -- were still paid a fraction of the prize money available to their male counterparts			1
the men had formed their own union -- the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) in 1972 -- and @entity14 was convinced it needed to be replicated for women			1
using her famous powers of persuasion , and with help from other key figures such as @entity75 @entity74 , compatriots @entity76 and @entity78 and @entity80 's @entity79 , a meeting was convened at the @entity82 in @entity83 , just before the @entity85 championships			2
within a few short hours , the articles of the association were signed and the @entity23 was born			2
player power " we finally all came together as one voice and having the power of one -- you know just one group			0
it made such a difference , " @entity14 told @entity0			2
@entity96 was then just starting out on her incredible career , and it was only later that she appreciated the significance of what had happened			0
" my first year playing -- 1973 , my first @entity85 -- i had no idea what the association was , but being @entity106 and being a bit older , @entity105 again had the foresight to get us organized just in time , " the @entity101 - born @entity96 told @entity0			1
already an influential figure in the @entity106 and helped by her then husband @entity111 , an astute lawyer , @entity14 had threatened to boycott the @entity112 if equal prize money was not awarded			1
as defending champion , @entity14 had considerable leverage and the organizers gave in to her demands			1
when @entity31 won the 1973 title she received the same prize purse -- $ 25,000 -- as the men 's champion			2
male chauvinism but this concession was the exception rather than the rule in major sports			0
such male chauvinism was personified by former @entity85 champion @entity24 , a shameless self publicist , who made a fortune from gambling on his own tennis matches			1
seeing an opportunity to make more money , @entity24 challenged both @entity31 and @entity14 , claiming that even in middle age -- he was 55 -- he could beat the top women players			1
@entity14 ignored him at first , but @entity31 took up the challenge and played him in a match in @entity137 on may 13 , 1973			2
@entity14 had realized the significance of the occasion and had done her best to encourage the @entity60 to take it seriously			2
" i said , ' @entity59 it 's not a tennis match , it 's about social change , it 's about social justice , it 's about all the things we 're working for , ' and she goes , ' i do n't '			0
she was n't politically orientated ! @entity24 match " so @entity59 played him @entity150 in 1973 and lost ( 6 - 1 6 - 2 )			1
it 's called the @entity150 massacre and i just thought , ' oh no ! ' " @entity14 needed no second bidding , and the famous " @entity27 " match came to fruition on september 20 in the @entity155			1
" i thought it would set us back 50 years if i did n't win that match , " said @entity14			2
" it would ruin the women 's tour and affect the self esteem of all women			1
" the entrances -- @entity14 on a gold litter in the style of @entity167 , @entity24 on a rickshaw pulled by women models in skimpy outfits -- added to the theater			1
once the match started , @entity14 , at 29 and the peak of her powers , made her opponent eat his earlier words and boasts			2
with a winner - take - all $ 100,000 check riding on the outcome , @entity24 lost his nerve and was beaten 6 - 4 6 - 3 6 - 3			1
iconic moment " the drop shot and volley heard around the world , " said @entity80 's @entity184 newspaper as an estimated global tv audience of 50 million watched the rout			0
@entity14 and @entity24 embraced at the end , and became friends off the court until his death in 1995 of prostate cancer			1
prior to the @entity23 's formation , @entity14 had realized the significance of legislation passed through the @entity197 and @entity198 and signed into law by president @entity200 in june 1972			1
@entity201 made it a requirement under law for male and female students to be afforded equal federal funding in their high school and college studies			0
" before that , young women were not getting anything , there was gender quotas -- like 5 % in the medical school at @entity215 -- there were really terrible gender quotas and also women could not get an athletic scholarship in the @entity106 , " said @entity14			1
" now because of @entity201 , women from all over the world can go to our @entity106 colleges on a scholarship and get grants			1
it 's very powerful because it 's about equality in education and activities , and sports comes under activities			2
" quantum leap according to 18 - time grand slam singles winner @entity96 , @entity14 took advantage of the mood of the moment to push through changes which were ahead of their time			1
" @entity105 , she just pushed the clock forward , she sped up the process , " @entity96 said			0
" any progress is measured by jumps , and that was one of those jumps that pushed the clock forward and allowed us to move forward as women athletes and to make a career out of it so it was n't just a hobby			0
" @entity14 was to play competitive singles for 10 more years after her 1973 heroics on and off the court , but injuries took their toll			2
her final grand slam singles triumph came at @entity85 in 1975 , her sixth success on the grass at @entity263 , but victory in the women 's doubles at the @entity267 competed her set of 39 major titles overall			1
a firm believer in the team ethic , she played for and captained the @entity106 in the @entity273 and @entity274 competitions , while @entity14 and her husband @entity111 were founding partners of @entity277 in 1974			1
team ethic the format of that competition sees men and women playing a five - set competition in a mix of singles , doubles and mixed doubles			2
it has proved a successful formula , with the franchises playing to big crowds across the @entity106			0
for @entity14 , the whole ethos of the event sums up her attitude to life and equality			2
" that 's the way i want the world to look : men and women working together , championing each other , helping each other , promoting each other -- we 're all in this world together , " she said			0
the fight she started for equal prize money in the grand slams took 34 years to reach its fruition when @entity85 became the last of the four to fall into line in 2007			0
" i remember the fight for prize money , i remember how many meetings were set , how many battles we had , and we all seemed to have stood by what we believed was right , " @entity311 told @entity0 when a unique meeting of former no. 1s gathered at @entity85 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the @entity23			0
@entity311 , who has become the highest earning female athlete in the world , acknowledged that she and the current leading players owe a lot to @entity14			0
grateful thanks " she had a big role obviously , there is a lot to be grateful for , " she said			0
@entity14 shows no sign of slowing up , with her commitments to @entity277 and various foundations			0
in 2009 , she was awarded the @entity333 and found out that president @entity334 was a fan of hers from time she spent in @entity337 when he was young			0
" it 's funny because he actually watched me practice at his high school			0
he told me when i met him for the first time , " added @entity14 , who was honored for her work advocating for the rights of women and the lesbian and gay community			1
she was divorced from @entity350 in 1987 and her current partner @entity351 is a former professional on the @entity23			0
life 's goals even as a precocious teenager on the public courts of @entity356 in @entity137 in the late 1950s , @entity14 had decided her priorities			2
" i had an epiphany about our sport			0
i really wanted to spend the rest of my life fighting for equal rights and opportunities for boys and girls , men and women , " said @entity14			1
" i always knew if i could ever be no. 1 in tennis , i 'd have a platform			0
" @entity14 has used that platform to great effect and the current no. 1 , @entity374 , remains her biggest fan			0
" @entity105 has been my ultimate inspiration , " @entity374 , who will start the defense of her @entity5 title in @entity378 next week , told @entity0			0
" i had the honor of playing when she was @entity274 captain and i learned so much from her			0
" not just women 's tennis but women 's sport would be greatly diminished if it was n't for @entity105			1
" but it 's been a journey that has taken its toll even on someone as outwardly tough as @entity14			2
" i 've stood up but i 'm scared a lot			0
i 'm really scared a lot , " she revealed			0
" i felt very alone , very isolated at times but you know what -- i always felt like we were trying to do the right thing then i did n't care so much what people thought			0
