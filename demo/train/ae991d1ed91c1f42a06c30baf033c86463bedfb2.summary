-- the @entity1 , romantic banks of the @entity3 and historic spas draw the crowds to @entity6 , but there 's a whole world underground within the city limits			1
while one half of the city , @entity14 , is flat , @entity11 's curvy hills are rich with secret labyrinths , hidden bunkers and caving adventures			1
there are up to 200 caves in total			2
@entity6 's subterranean world owes its debt to the city 's spas , or rather their water , which has carved out a network of caverns			1
here are some of the highlights			0
@entity6 's natural caves one of the best things about @entity6 is its proximity to nature			1
less than half an hour 's bus ride from downtown , where the city 's outer @entity37 turns into lush hills , there are a number of natural caves worth visiting			1
beautiful crystal formations deck out the caves under @entity44 , at nearby @entity46 , the caves are more familiar , with stalactites and stalagmites			2
@entity49 , @entity50 ut 162 , @entity6 @entity51 , @entity52 ut 35 , @entity6 ( websites in @entity54 ) spelunking beneath the city adventurous cavers who enjoy getting dirty , wriggling through tight holes and scaling slippery walls are in luck			1
the @entity46 caves actually make up the longest cave network in @entity54 , running from a valley housing the showpiece caves into @entity6 's @entity65			1
descending a metal ladder into a pit 10 meters ( 33 feet ) below , tours emerge into a room known as the " chapel " that was once used as an underground place of worship			2
the three - hour tour gets more difficult as the air gets thinner and the passages tighter -- but the humor and encouragement of the guide makes up for the physical discomforts			0
tours can be booked with an @entity81 - speaking guide for groups of more than four			2
ticket price includes a guide , all necessary equipment and entrance to the caves			2
@entity88 , @entity90 ut 162 , @entity6 the hospital in the @entity92 @entity93 , the mound overlooking the @entity3 that shoulders @entity6 's sprawling palace complex , also holds a few subterranean treasures			1
unlike the city 's other caves , these passageways have been in use for centuries -- they tell a series of gruesome tales from the city 's history			1
located on the side of the hill , on the road winding up to the castle , the @entity91 in the @entity92 is n't technically part of the original cave system , although it connects up with it			0
once an underground hospital used in @entity114 , most notably during the siege of @entity6 , it eventually became a secret nuclear bunker during the @entity117			1
the museum can be visited only on a guided tour , which runs on the hour in both @entity81 and @entity54			1
tours take visitors through tunnels into the old hospital and end up in the radiation contamination room , where they get to play with an air - raid siren			1
creepy wax figures lend an air of authenticity to the horrors of the conditions experienced in wartime , when the hospital , built for only 60 - 70 patients , took in more than 600 wounded			2
hospital in the @entity136 , @entity6 @entity138 's prison and the @entity139 the @entity139 is part of the natural cave system under @entity93			1
it 's shown signs of being inhabited as far back as prehistoric times , with people living there as late as the 11th and 12th centuries			0
caves here have since functioned as wine cellars and masonry mines , but come wrapped in curious myths			0
the @entity152 used them for military purposes in the 16th century , but archeological evidence also hints at an underground harem			0
one of the @entity139 's headline attractions is @entity157 , known better as @entity157 , or @entity138 , who spent a spell down here as a prisoner			1
visiting the @entity139 is a campy experience filled with waxworks dressed in old opera costumes			0
an overworked smoke machine and spooky soundtrack pump out into a damp corner known as @entity167			0
bonus creepiness : after 6 p.m. , visitors are guided around the dark caves by lantern and have to figure their own way out in the dark			2
9 , @entity6 , or @entity177 ut			0
4/a , @entity6 the @entity178 of @entity179 @entity179 is a landmark in @entity6			0
rising above the @entity3 , it overlooks the whole city and guards its own cave network			0
unlike the caves beneath the city 's other hills , most of these are closed off			1
the main cave open to the public , @entity189 's , houses a small church with an entrance facing one of @entity6 's most famous spas , the @entity196			1
use of the cave as a church is fairly new			0
@entity200 occupied it in the 1920s but it was sealed up for decades after the @entity203 @entity202 captured @entity6 in 1945			0
