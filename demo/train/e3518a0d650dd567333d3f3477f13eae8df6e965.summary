-- @entity1 looks different than she did 10 years ago			1
big deal — who does n't ? maybe she had plastic surgery			1
maybe a little lipo , too			0
or maybe her new look , at 45 , is truly courtesy of her living a healthier , happier life away from the constant media glare , as she reportedly told @entity10			1
considering how mean - spirited some of the response has been since @entity1 showed up at the @entity13 much slimmer than we remembered , who could question the effect time away from the vitriol can have on a person ? @entity19 : why so quick to pick apart @entity1 's looks ? @entity1 only spoke with people after the huge fuss the media made about that @entity13 event , she said , because " the folks who come digging around for some nefarious truth which does n't exist wo n't get off my porch until i answer the door			1
" i would think the real headline is " public dissatisfied about @entity1 's happiness			1
" because that 's all she talked about : being happy			2
the face and body we associated with her for all these years was , in her words , a byproduct of having " a schedule that is not realistically sustainable and did n't allow for taking care of myself			1
" makes sense to me			0
i ca n't tell you how many former @entity49 players i have come across who look nothing like the men i saw on the field — significant weight loss , clean - shaven , hell , just being clean for a change			1
and dare i say healthier			0
it is possible for people to change without going under the knife			2
and it is possible to be happy in your own skin , even if you do opt for plastic surgery			2
more than 15 million cosmetic procedures were performed in 2013			2
i think it 's safe to assume not all — if any — were done on @entity1			1
in fact , it 's downright hypocritical for anyone in a country that has been known to spend $ 1.4 billion a year on over-the - counter teeth - whitening products to get bent out of shape if someone does change his or her appearance			1
face it , we 're all nipping and tucking in our way			0
our sense of what is beautiful has been redefined by a diet of photoshopped images -- and 45 - year - old actresses who feel they must nip and tuck and not look their age in order to be cast			0
those who dare to not join in may be called " less classically beautiful " in the eyes of the @entity87 , who tried to pin such a slight on @entity90 , the star of " how to get away with murder			0
" i was reminded of the slight in the show 's most recent episode as @entity96 ' character removed her wig , fake eyelashes , and makeup on camera			2
there she was completely untouched for the world to see			0
and the fact that doing so is considered " brave " says more about our culture 's warped sensibilities than @entity96 ' beauty			1
of course , the backlash over @entity1 's new look has little if anything to do with her			1
for some reason , we want her to answer for something that at the end of the day is none of our business			0
we want to know why her face appears different , why her signature puffy cheeks are gone			0
unfortunately , that she says she is now happy and taking care of herself does not resonate			0
we apparently want her to say she had plastic surgery			0
tell me : who 's the superficial one here ?			0

@entity125 : many *buzzed* that @entity1 looked different when she appeared at @entity13 event
@entity125 : who does n't change in 10 years ? she says she 's happier . why is n't that enough for us ?
he says a country that spends billions on cosmetic surgery is not in a position to judge
@entity125 : to try to meet media 's beauty *standard* , we all work on appearance
