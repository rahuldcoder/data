-- days before @entity2 hosts the world for the @entity4 , authorities have acted to punish those they say violated a ban on " gay propaganda , " a prohibition derided by activists and defended by conservatives , who say it protects young people			1
those penalized include @entity15 , the creator of an online support group for @entity2 's gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender teens , state - run @entity13 reported friday			1
according to the news agency , the support group features posts from gay teens about dealing with homophobia and trying to gain acceptance in @entity2 activists said @entity15 , who set up the @entity27 on the social networking website @entity29 , faces a fine of up to 100,000 rubles ( about $ 2,850 @entity31 ) , after an ultraconservative lawmaker urged authorities to look into the site			1
@entity35 , who helped lead the push to enact the legislation , told @entity13 he made the request believing the group spurs teenagers to question their sexuality			0
" without such groups , no kids like that would exist , " @entity35 said			0
passed last summer , the " gay propaganda " law makes it illegal to tell children about gay equality			1
it has been widely criticized not only by @entity52 advocates but also by @entity54 leaders , who have called it archaic and discriminatory			0
@entity13 called @entity15 's case the fifth related to the " gay propaganda " law since it has been enacted			1
another case reported by the same agency on thursday ended with the editor - in - chief of @entity63 newspaper , in @entity2 's far eastern @entity65 region , being fined 50,000 rubles			1
@entity66 was punished for a september article about a geography teacher and gay rights activist who said he was pressured into quitting his job and assaulted by neo-nazis because of his sexuality , according to a @entity13 report			2
@entity66 denied during his trial that this story was propaganda and vowed to appeal			2
these two incidents come about 10 days after @entity2 prime minister @entity78 told @entity0 's @entity79 that he had not " heard that this law " -- meaning the " gay propaganda " prohibition -- " was applied in practice			1
" " there are many talks , but no application of the law , practical application , " @entity78 said , adding that much of the criticism has come from outside @entity2			2
" so , i believe that this has nothing in common with the real situation in our country			0
" days earlier , on january 17 , @entity2 president @entity96 defended a law that he said was about protecting children , not about banning homosexuality			1
@entity96 : gays ' can feel safe ' at @entity101 " we have just recently passed a law prohibiting propaganda , and not of homosexuality , but of homosexuality and child abuse , child sexual abuse			0
but this has nothing to do with persecuting individuals for their sexual orientation , " he told reporters			0
" so , there is no danger for people of such nontraditional sexual orientation who are planning to come to the games as guests or participants			0
" the scrutiny over the law comes at a time when @entity2 is under the spotlight as host of the upcoming @entity4			2
they start february 7 in the @entity128 city of @entity129 .			0
