@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 started a garden with his 4 - year - old daughter in 2002 , he never imagined it would change the lives of thousands of people			1
that first year , they grew much more produce than their family could eat			2
@entity4 did not want the excess going to waste , so he started giving it to friends and co-workers			1
then he learned about others who needed it more			0
" we saw a three - line article in the paper , " @entity4 remembers			1
" it said , ' if you ever have extra produce , bring it down to the food pantry			2
grow a row for the hungry			0
' " @entity4 and his daughter donated 120 pounds of produce that year			1
he knew the experience would provide some good lessons for her			0
but it opened his eyes , too			0
" at first , i thought it was just that people were hungry , " @entity4 said			1
" but then i realized that people were hungry for fresh fruits and vegetables			0
" since then , @entity4 has been helping to provide fresh produce for more than just his local pantry			1
his nonprofit , @entity43 's @entity42 , now grows and harvests fruits and vegetables for people in need all over the state			1
" @entity1 , the @entity1 , is known for its produce , " said @entity4 , 47			1
" ( but ) there 's tons of produce throughout this state that , unfortunately , does n't make its way to a lot of the people that are in need here			1
" spreading the wealth @entity4 started the organization from his small plot , with help from family and close friends			1
every weekday for almost four years , he worked in the garden from 5 a.m. to 8 a.m. before heading off to his full - time job			1
then he gardened again until nightfall			0
in 2007 , he left his corporate job to dedicate himself full time to the nonprofit			1
it has grown to 49 acres of farmland and almost 4,000 volunteers			1
to help distribute the hundreds of thousands of pounds of produce it grows each year , the group partnered with the @entity75 of @entity1			1
they also collect excess from other farms and supermarkets in the area			2
the produce is donated to food banks all over the state			1
" our goal is to get everybody in the state -- whether it be a child or an adult -- to be able to eat healthy , " @entity4 said			2
" it 's not something that should be a luxury			0
" when @entity4 learned about food deserts -- areas in the country that do not have access to healthy , affordable food -- he and his group set up farm markets to provide free fresh produce to residents of these areas			1
from july to november , the group holds its free farm markets in five cities in @entity1 , including @entity105 and @entity106			2
residents also receive healthy recipes for preparing the produce			0
the group 's free farm markets have been a lifesaver for @entity113			0
living on a fixed income , the 64 - year - old had trouble getting the fresh food necessary for her health			0
" i have diabetes and high blood pressure			0
eating healthy is very important to me , " she said			0
" some things that i need for my diet , a lot of times i ca n't afford , especially produce			0
" @entity113 now goes to the group 's farm markets in @entity128 , and things have turned around for her			0
" i have lost some weight			0
my sugar is better controlled , and the vegetables and food is delicious , " @entity113 said			0
" without @entity4 , nobody around here would be eating fresh fruits and vegetables like we do			2
" little farmers for @entity4 and his group , the work is about more than just feeding people			2
the goal also is to educate people of all ages about where their food comes from and why it is important			0
@entity4 said recipients also return to volunteer with the group			2
" there 's a sense of community that comes out of this program , " he said			0
the group 's summer youth program introduces children from @entity1 's inner city areas to farming and healthy eating			1
for many of these children , it is their first time on a farm			0
" they immediately are struck by the fact that food grows out of the ground , " @entity4 said			2
" for them to be able to actually pull it out of the ground and harvest it and then bring it home to their families , that 's huge			0
" @entity43 's @entity176 has donated almost 3 million pounds of fresh produce , which has reached roughly 140,000 people			1
@entity4 plans to expand the program to other states			2
" to be able to put fresh food on someone 's plate who 's hungry that night , " @entity4 said , " there 's no greater feeling and no greater reward			1
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity43 's @entity189 website at @entity190 and see how to help .			1

when @entity4 's garden amassed excess produce in 2002 , he donated the extras
he soon began a nonprofit , harvesting crops for the @entity1 's less fortunate
by 2007 , he left his corporate job to dedicate himself full time to @entity43 's @entity189
it has since grown to 49 acres of farmland and nearly 4,000 volunteers
