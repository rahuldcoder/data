a @entity6 baby scientists thought was " functionally cured " of @entity7 now has detectable levels of the virus in her blood , her doctors say			1
the news is disappointing for a case the scientific community hailed just last year as a potential game changer in the fight against @entity13			0
" it felt like a punch to the gut , " dr. @entity14 , a pediatric @entity7 specialist at the @entity15 , said of seeing signs of the virus on test results earlier this month			1
" it was extremely disappointing from both the scientific standpoint ... but mainly for the sake of the child who is back on medicine and expected to stay on medicine for a very long time			0
" media outlets around the world covered the @entity6 case when it was first made public in march 2013			1
@entity30 updated its story again in october when researchers announced the toddler was still @entity7 free			1
the child was born to a mother who received no prenatal care and was not diagnosed as hiv - positive herself until just before delivery			2
" we did n't have the opportunity to treat the mom during the pregnancy as we would like to be able to do , to prevent transmission to the baby , " @entity14 said last year			2
doctors administered high doses of three antiretroviral drugs 30 hours after the girl was born in case she was infected			1
they hoped to control the virus , which was not detectable at the time			2
the child remained on antiretroviral drugs for approximately 18 months			1
her mother then stopped administering the drugs for an unknown reason			2
a few months later , doctors said the little girl had no evidence of the life - threatening disease in her blood			0
they announced that the girl was the first child to be " functionally cured " of @entity7			1
a " functional cure " is when the presence of the virus is so small , lifelong treatment is not necessary and standard clinical tests can not detect the virus in the blood			2
however , during a routine doctor visit early this month , tests detected @entity7 antibodies in the now 4 - year - old child			2
her t - cell count was also low , indicating a weakened immune system			0
more than two years after being taken off the medication , doctors started her again on antiretroviral therapy			0
she will need to be on these medications for life -- or until scientists find a cure for @entity7			2
" certainly , this is a disappointing turn of events for this young child , the medical staff involved in the child 's care , and the hiv / aids research community , " niaid director dr. @entity82 said in a statement			0
" scientifically , this development reminds us that we still have much more to learn about the intricacies of hiv infection and where the virus hides in the body			0
" despite the setback , researchers are optimistic about using this early treatment method on infants infected with @entity7			1
a clinical trial aimed at studying the effect will be amended to include this new information , they said , before it begins recruiting participants			0
" we ´ ve always known that the search for an @entity7 cure was n't going to be easy , " @entity106 , president of the @entity107 , said in a statement			2
" cases like this are hugely important for informing researchers on where to focus their efforts			0
" current treatment methods researchers have long known that treating hiv - positive mothers while they are pregnant is important for the health of the child because they pass antibodies on to their babies that can protect them from disease			0
all hiv - positive moms will pass on those antibodies , but only 30 % will transmit the actual virus , said dr. @entity128 , an immunologist at the @entity129 who worked closely with @entity14			0
and @entity7 - positive mothers who are given appropriate treatment pass on the virus in less than 2 % of cases			1
" so all babies are born antibody - positive , but only a fraction of babies born to hiv - positive women will actually get the virus , and that fraction depends on whether the mom and baby are getting antiviral prophylaxis ( preventive treatment ) or not			1
" newborns are considered high - risk if their mothers ' hiv infections are not under control or if the mothers are found to be @entity7 - positive when they 're close to delivering			1
usually , these infants would get antiviral drugs at preventive doses for six weeks to prevent infection , then start antiretroviral therapy , or @entity151 , if @entity7 is diagnosed			1
@entity151 is a combination of at least three drugs used to suppress the virus and stop the progression of the disease			2
but they do not kill the virus			0
in march , doctors announced that another child born with @entity7 appeared to be free of the virus after receiving similar treatment to the @entity6 baby			1
the case report was presented at the annual @entity162 in @entity163			0
the girl was delivered at @entity165 in @entity166 , @entity167 , last summer to a mother with @entity7 who had not received antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy			1
doctors gave the baby high doses of three drugs -- @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 -- four hours after birth			1
eleven days later , the virus was undetectable in her body and remained undetectable eight months later			0
" taking kids off antiretroviral therapy intentionally is not standard of care , " said dr. @entity181 at the time , a virologist with @entity183 who has been involved in both cases			0
on thursday @entity181 said the @entity167 baby is still on antiretroviral treatment and doing well , said @entity181			1
" at this time , there is no plan to stop treatment			0
" measles virus used to put woman 's cancer into remission			0

@entity6 baby " cured " of @entity7 is now showing signs of the virus
baby was given high doses of three antiretroviral drugs *shortly* after birth
baby born with @entity7 in @entity167 was given the same treatment
