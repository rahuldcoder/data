-- my grandfather @entity1 and my father @entity3 dedicated their lives to revealing the ocean 's wonders and helping us understand our connection to this vast expanse of water			1
their work inspired generations and filled people with awe			2
times have changed and so have circumstances and perceptions about the ocean			0
in recent years , the focus has been on the very serious challenges the ocean faces and the impact these challenges are already having on our daily lives			1
the effects of climate change , pollution and overfishing should be making headlines because the ocean and all of us -- and i literally mean all humankind -- who depend on its resources are facing the very real prospect of the catastrophic collapse of ocean ecosystems if we continue on our current course			2
watch : going @entity43 : oceans on friday march 29 at 15:30 gmt despite the challenges our ocean faces , i believe it 's time to recapture the sense of wonder and inspiration my grandfather and father felt when they gazed on its surface			1
in fact , the ocean can and should be a source of hope and solutions for a brighter future			2
before you accuse of me of eschewing cold hard reality for a world view through rose - colored glasses , hear me out			0
what i 'm proposing is that we step back and look at the potential a healthy ocean has to provide us with a prosperous and sustainable future			1
just take a moment to think about what the ocean does for us on a daily basis : it produces half of the world 's oxygen ; it provides more than one billion people with their primary source of protein ; its natural eco-systems like coral reefs , mangroves and wetlands provide protection against coastal erosion and natural disasters such as tsunamis ; it regulates our climate ; and a healthy ocean fuels sustainable businesses and a strong economy in industries such as seafood , tourism , pharmaceuticals and shipping			1
read / watch : ' the most imaginative person i 've ever met ' that 's really only the beginning			0
check out @entity105 's " why the @entity106 " feature if you want to be truly amazed			0
my point is the answers to many of our greatest environmental and social challenges literally surrounds us			0
for the ocean to continue to do what 's it 's done for millions of years and serve the needs of a rapidly expanding human population , it needs to be healthy			1
biodiversity , coral reefs , wetlands and trash - free seas are n't just terms on a page they are environmental imperatives that dictate the future of the planet			1
we have the know - how and resources to conserve and restore the aquatic and marine systems that keep the ocean and us healthy			2
as my grandfather once said , " the technology that we use to abuse the planet is the same technology that can help us to heal it			0
" big technology like renewable energy , carbon sequestration and advances in aquaculture certainly have a major role in restoring the ocean and the planet to a healthy balance , but in many cases it 's a matter of giving nature the space and time to do what it needs to do with a helping hand from all of us			1
regulations that help replenish and protect fish stocks , restoration and conservation projects to protect and nurture natural barriers like reefs and wetlands , and reforestation efforts are all things that can have a huge impact on ocean health with no rocket science necessary			1
take fisheries for example , with two billion people joining us on this planet over the next 40 years , there will be a huge need for more sources of protein			1
if these needed protein sources were to come primarily from livestock there is the very real potential for catastrophic pollution of water and land , not to mention the exponential increase in carbon emissions			0
but , by some estimates , simply managing fisheries better could feed up to one billion of those people and remember , seafood is 7 - 10 times more efficient as a source of protein than land - based meat sources ... if managed properly			0
if you are thinking this all sounds like the future of the ocean is in the hands of policymakers and big industry , please think again			2
every hour of every day each of us have the opportunity to make choices with impact , from what we eat and the things we buy to the examples we set for our children and friends			0
the good news is technology and future - focused groups are providing us with some great tools and resources to get inspired and make smart decisions			0
for example : the @entity217 's @entity216 pocket guide and @entity105 's @entity219 app or @entity221 's @entity220			0
we can make sure the ocean continues to provide inspiration , wonder and solutions for generations , however , it all comes down to personal and collective will			0
ask yourself this question : when you look upon the ocean 10 years from now , do you want to see a sad reminder of what could have been ; or do you want to be filled with awe and inspired by a sense of endless possibilities ? the opinions expressed in this article are solely those of @entity239			1

it 's time to recapture our sense of wonder about the oceans , says @entity239
environmental advocate asks people to think hard about all the services it provides humankind
having a healthy ocean is an " environmental imperative " that will " dictate future of planet "
measures to protect fish stocks and eco-systems can have huge impact on ocean health
