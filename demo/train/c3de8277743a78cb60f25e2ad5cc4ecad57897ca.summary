@entity1 acting interior minister @entity0 said wednesday that the separatist protests in @entity1 's eastern region would be resolved within 48 hours -- either through negotiations or the use of force			1
at the same time , @entity7 insisted that the presence of its troops just over the border was no reason to worry			2
the @entity13 and others have accused @entity7 of fomenting the separatist unrest as a pretext for military intervention			1
using classified and commercial satellite imagery , the @entity13 estimates there are up to 40,000 @entity7 troops on the border with eastern @entity1			1
@entity22 has also warned of a major troop buildup			0
the @entity13 ambassador in @entity25 , @entity26 , posted photos via @entity28 on wednesday to illustrate the @entity13 estimates			1
the photos depict what is supposedly a field outside the @entity7 city of @entity34 -- empty in october , filled with troops and armored vehicles on april 2			2
a @entity13 official with direct knowledge of the matter told @entity40 those photos " are consistent " with classified imagery			2
@entity44 is sharing some information with the @entity1 , but not highly classified intelligence , the official said			0
@entity1 was aligned with @entity48 until a month ago , and it is believed @entity1 's security services are still penetrated by the @entity7 , the official said			1
but @entity7 's @entity51 said wednesday that @entity1 and the @entity13 have " no reason for concern " about the presence of @entity7 forces , which it says are on military exercises			1
" @entity7 has repeatedly stated that it does not conduct unusual or unplanned activities which are militarily significant on its territory near the border with @entity1 , " the @entity51 said in a prepared statement			2
it added that accusations that @entity7 was building up its armed forces were " groundless			0
" asked if he considered the threat of a @entity7 advance into @entity1 more likely now than last week , defense secretary @entity65 told @entity40 's @entity68 , " we are always vigilant			1
we are always looking at the options that we need to take			0
" @entity70 said gen. @entity71 , @entity22 's supreme allied commander in @entity72 , has been asked to develop " new and additional measures and options			0
" meanwhile , the separatist protests in eastern @entity1 have entered their fourth day			2
pro-russian protesters seized government buildings in the cities of @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 on sunday			0
rebels who occupied @entity79 's regional government building a day later -- declaring a " people 's republic " and calling for a referendum on secession from @entity1 to be held by may 11 -- remained in control of the building wednesday , holed up behind substantial makeshift barricades			2
in @entity81 , more than 70 people were detained tuesday in what @entity1 authorities said was an anti-terrorism operation , as security forces cleared a government building of protesters			0
the 48 - hour deadline set by @entity0 to end the crisis may escalate the tensions in @entity1 's eastern region			1
" there are two opposite ways for resolving this conflict -- a political dialogue and the heavy - handed approach			0
we are ready for both , " he said , according to official news agency @entity109			0
on tuesday , @entity48 warned that any use of force to crack down on protests in the region , which borders @entity7 , could lead to civil war and called for " the immediate cessation of any military preparations			2
" opinion : turning @entity119 into ' @entity120 ' ? hostage reports there were conflicting reports late tuesday over whether demonstrators who seized control of a @entity127 building in @entity80 took hostages			0
an anti-terrorism unit outside the building said the @entity131 demonstrators were holding hostages , @entity133 , a @entity127 spokeswoman , and @entity135 , spokesman for the @entity137 , told @entity40			0
fifty - one people were released from the building early wednesday morning , the @entity127 said in a statement			0
but pro-russian demonstrators holed up in the building denied having taken anyone hostage , according to @entity143 reports			0
@entity1 interim president @entity144 reiterated tuesday that he would treat @entity131 separatists who have seized buildings in the country 's east as " terrorists " who will be prosecuted with the full force of the law			2
his remarks came ahead of a vote in parliament that approved legislation outlawing groups and individuals who call for separatism			0
of the 450 members of the @entity1 parliament , 230 voted in favor of the bill			0
@entity165 : ' contrived pretext ' for intervention @entity13 secretary of state @entity165 discussed the situation in eastern @entity1 twice on the phone wednesday with his @entity7 counterpart , foreign minister @entity170			1
the two officials talked about " the importance of resolving the security situation in key cities in eastern @entity1 peacefully and through dialogue , and they both rejected the use of force to obtain political objectives , " @entity172 spokeswoman @entity171 said			1
@entity165 said tuesday that @entity7 forces and special agents were behind what he called the most - recent " chaos " in eastern @entity1			1
he described the developments as " more than deeply disturbing " and said they amounted to what could be a " contrived pretext for military intervention just as we saw in @entity119			0
" echoing that view , @entity193 foreign minister @entity192 told @entity40 's " @entity198 " show that @entity7 is financing subversion in eastern @entity1 using the pretext of ethnic tensions			1
" what 's happening in @entity1 is unacceptable , " he said			2
" a more powerful nation is first taking a province away from a less powerful country and now financing subversion using the pretext of ethnic problems , which are nonexistent			0
" @entity165 will meet monday with his @entity7 , @entity1 and @entity207 counterparts to discuss efforts to de-escalate the crisis , according to a statement from @entity207 foreign policy chief @entity211			1
@entity216 " calls against any further destabilization of @entity1 , whether from the inside or the outside , " the statement said			0
@entity218 chancellor @entity217 told her country 's parliament wednesday that " the situation in the @entity1 remains difficult ... and unfortunately in many places it is not clear how @entity7 helps the de-escalation of the situation			1
" therefore we will continue to do what we 've been doing : on the one hand pursue a path of dialogue , but on the other hand make clear that in our view @entity1 has a right to its own development			0
@entity1 must decide its own destiny , and in this we will help @entity1			0
" @entity165 warned of increased sanctions targeting @entity7 's banking , energy , mining and arms sectors if the @entity7 " cross over " into eastern @entity1			1
current sanctions target individuals over @entity7 's annexation of @entity1 's southeastern @entity119 last month			1
@entity246 ship headed for @entity247 similar pattern seen in revolts @entity13 officials told @entity40 on tuesday that one reason the @entity13 believes @entity7 may have orchestrated the @entity131 demonstrations in @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 is that the disturbances and violence had a similar pattern and similar separatist motivations , even though the cities are at significant distances from one another			2
@entity13 officials have long noted that these three cities are specific areas that @entity48 has been trying to influence			0
although @entity1 forces have been able to regain control for now , the @entity13 assessment is that @entity7 may be trying to fabricate a pretext for military action using some of the tens of thousands of troops still massed on the border , several @entity13 officials told @entity40			1
even after weeks of tension and uncertainty , the @entity13 does not know what political calculation @entity7 president @entity272 might make in deciding whether or not to move his troops into @entity1 , officials said			1
the belief is the decision will be made by @entity272 with little or no influence from his top military and foreign policy advisers			0
there is also a @entity13 view that @entity272 may leave the troops on the border for some time to come to intimidate @entity1 's government , @entity13 officials said			1
those troops remain positioned so close , and are so heavily armed , that the @entity13 and @entity22 calculate they could " roll across " eastern @entity1 in three to five days , one official said			1
@entity7 has said it does not intend to invade eastern @entity1 , although it says it reserves the right to intervene to protect ethnic @entity7 .			1
