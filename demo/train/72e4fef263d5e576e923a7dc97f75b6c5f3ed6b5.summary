" in the last few years , we 've seen the economy take a nose dive , and more people are affected by that , " said dr. @entity36 , a medical director at the @entity37			0
" more people are stressed			0
stress is associated with sleep deprivation , anxiety , depression and sleeplessness			2
the economy is a major factor why people are losing sleep			2
" the findings echo a survey conducted by the @entity55 , which reported last year that 52 percent of 7,000 respondents were losing sleep at night from stress			1
aside from financial anxieties , in just a decade society has become more around - the clock and more complex			1
" this has been more insidious over two decades , " @entity36 said			0
" with the advent of the @entity66 , cell phone , @entity64 , we 're seeing our society is increasingly 24 - 7			1
people are able to be active at any time from anywhere , and it causes people to be more active around the clock			0
this increased activity is essentially giving sleep less importance			2
" the mean hours of sleep on a weeknight dwindled from an average of 7 hours in 2001 to 6.7 hours this year , according to the @entity14 's poll			1
it could be that life in 2009 has more distractions , said dr. @entity84 , the medical director of the @entity86 laboratory in @entity87 , @entity88			0
so what 's taking time away from sleep ? " it 's been entertainment , @entity66 , playing games or tv			2
people have all sorts of distractions they did n't have back then ( in previous years ) , " @entity84 said			0

you lose the ability to detect how tired you are			0
it 's not unusual to fall asleep behind the wheel			0
" but there is contradicting research on how much sleep @entity1 are getting			1
@entity119 , a sociology professor at the @entity120 , challenged the notion that people are sleeping less in the 24 - 7 treadmill of modern life			1
" there has been no decline in sleep			0
it 's been sustained , " he said , according to time - use surveys that date back to 1965			0
@entity119 , a past director of the @entity1 ' @entity131 , monitored time - use diaries to track how people spend their day			1
since 2003 , the @entity134 and the @entity135 have gathered time - use information that has consistently reported that @entity1 sleep 8.6 hours a day			1
dr. @entity137 , director of the @entity138 at @entity139 at @entity140 , said the statistic is difficult to believe , especially from his @entity143 practice			0
" i ca n't believe that people get that much sleep in this busy world of ours , " @entity137 said			0
" i think a lot of people need 8.6 hours of sleep , but i think very few people get it			2
" the huge disparities in the results from the @entity14 's poll and the government 's time diaries could be attributed to different methodologies , experts on each side said			1
the @entity14 's annual findings are based on a telephone survey of 1,000 people in which the participants are asked to estimate the number of hours they usually sleep			1
meanwhile , the government 's time use surveys ask people to detail hour - by - hour how they spent the previous day			1
between 2003 and 2005 , about 37,000 people were surveyed			0
the time use surveys may overestimate sleep , because sleeplessness such as insomnia , tossing and turning and lying awake are categorized as sleep , said dr. @entity178 , clinical psychologist at @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity181			0
" you may actually sleep four hours , but you 're in bed for eight hours , " said @entity178 , who is a board member with the @entity14			2
" they 're counting that as eight hours of sleep			2
" despite differences in the average hours , researchers and experts agree that stress and work rob a person of sleep			1
during tough economic times , people might work longer hours to avoid the risk of running behind on their workload and the possibility of a layoff			0
if a person is working more , he or she borrows that time from sleep			0
" that 's a bad loan , " @entity137 said			0
" there 's a lot of bad loans going around			0
borrowing from sleep is a bad way to go			0
" and modern society gets some of the blame			0
" our society has valued people who brag about being able to function on very little sleep as a mark of someone who is aggressive , dynamic , successful , " @entity137 said			2
" well , forget that			0
@entity218 someone who puts focus on sleep and is not making mistakes ( from sleep deprivation )			0
