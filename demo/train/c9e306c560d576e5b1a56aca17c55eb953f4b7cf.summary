a former cop " disenfranchised with law enforcement " and known to own " a lot of guns " is accused of killing his ex-wife before ambushing a sheriff and deputy who responded to the scene , a @entity1 official said monday			1
the deaths appear to have resulted from a " long - simmering domestic dispute , " @entity11 , the @entity1 's deputy director of investigations , told reporters			1
@entity17 , an ex-military contractor and a former law enforcement officer with the @entity20 and @entity21 , was found dead from what police believe was an exchange of gunfire with a deputy			1
@entity17 's 16 - year - old daughter and her boyfriend were at the house outside @entity30 when @entity17 arrived and produced a gun			1
she heard gunshots , saw her mom dead , called 911 and fled , @entity11 told reporters			1
@entity36 sheriff @entity35 , deputy @entity37 and a second unnamed deputy responded to the scene and found @entity40 dead in the garage , @entity11 said			1
@entity35 and the second deputy entered the house to search it , while @entity37 secured the garage entrance in case @entity17 returned , @entity11 said			2
there , @entity37 was " likely ambushed from a position @entity48 had taken " in a nearby wooded area , he said			2
struck by multiple bullets from @entity52 's @entity51 9 - millimeter , @entity37 took cover between two vehicles inside the garage			2
@entity35 and the other deputy entered the garage after hearing gunshots , and @entity17 fired again from a position to the side of the garage door , striking @entity35 in the bicep , @entity11 said			0
the second deputy then exchanged gunfire with @entity17 , @entity11 said			0
the officers called for backup , and after setting up a perimeter around the home , they found @entity17 's body in the back yard			1
there was no sign of a self - inflicted gunshot wound , and it appears he was killed by the " return fire by law enforcement , " @entity11 said			1
the medical examiner will make the final determination on @entity17 's cause of death			0
also in the yard was the body of @entity82 , a 45 - year - old @entity83 man who police believe " had some type of friendship with @entity40 , " @entity11 said			1
it 's unclear how @entity82 died			0
the sequence of events remains unclear , but early indications are that @entity82 was killed before police arrived			1
@entity35 was released from the @entity93 late sunday , and @entity37 remains in the hospital for " further treatment and observation , " county manager @entity92 said monday morning , adding that he 's " hopeful that he will be released soon			0
" the alleged shooter is a former @entity100 police dog handler who also worked for the @entity21 , @entity11 said			1
he left the sheriff 's office to take an overseas position as a military contractor and returned to the @entity36 force before being terminated in june 2013 following an allegation of domestic violence , @entity11 said			2
that allegation was never adjudicated , he said			0
though there had been no previous reports of gun activity involving @entity17 , @entity11 said it was " well - known that @entity17 had a lot of guns in his possession			2
" @entity11 said he was unaware of any bad blood among @entity17 and the sheriff and deputies who responded , but @entity17 was " disenfranchised with law enforcement in general			0
" @entity35 " was asked to go there to help with the situation , " @entity122 said , though he did n't say why the sheriff was requested at the scene			0
on sunday , @entity122 told @entity6 affiliate @entity125 that the sheriff responded to the call " probably because he knew the person who was involved in the incident " and because he thought he could calm down @entity52			0
the @entity21 made national headlines last year after the department @entity132 unit , based on word from an informant , conducted a drug raid at a house , throwing a flash - bang grenade and seriously burning a 19 - month - old baby			2
in that case , officers did not find the drugs they were seeking at the house , only methamphetamine residue			0
@entity36 is about 85 miles north of @entity144			0
@entity6 's @entity145 and @entity146 contributed to this report .			0
