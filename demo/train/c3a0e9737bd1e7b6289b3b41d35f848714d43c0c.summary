-- i go to the gym			1
it 's an excellent place to watch @entity4 while occupying a bench press that somebody else might otherwise use for actual exercise			1
" you done with this ? " " define done			0
" my other favorite part of an early workout is when the gym staff finally plops the morning newspapers on the media table , where thumbing through @entity15 for 20 minutes seems to be another great way to not improve my personal well being			1
then i hit the sauna			0
because , clearly , i 've earned it			0
so , my daily routine is n't exactly @entity20			1
in fact , it just barely even qualifies as being awake			0
which is a little pathetic when you consider that , now , even toddlers are taking on @entity20			1
yes , one of the most controversial and interesting fitness crazes around -- one that some people ( with incredibly loose standards ) even label as a " cult " -- is actually offering age - modified classes to children			1
that 's the larger story that people were talking about this week online			1
but , before diving deeper into that , i think it 's important , first , to understand what @entity20 actually is			1
you know ... as explained by someone who 's never done it			1
as best i comprehend the phenomenon , @entity20 is a strength and conditioning program that focuses on highly functional real - world movements that are constantly varied and performed at amazingly high intensity			1
participants work out in groups and meet not in a gym , but an industrial - looking " box " that is void of all the things i love most -- you know , @entity4 and @entity15			1
making @entity20 even more unique is the fact that you do n't decide your own routine			1
instead , there is a posted daily exercise that everyone does together			0
it 's called the workout of the day -- or the @entity61			2
on some days it might include nothing but front squats , and on another day you might find yourself lifting weights			0
but whatever it is , you 'll do it as a group , it 's going to be intense , and there 's a decent chance you might barf all over your nikes			2
my gym franchise would be slightly different			2
today we 're going to stare at our hands			0
" people who do @entity20 absolutely swear by it			1
others simply see it as snobbish , especially considering that it 's far more expensive than just joining an ordinary gym			1
for example , the " box " nearest me in @entity87 -- @entity88 -- charges $ 250/month			2
my current gym is $ 360 for the year			1
so , it 's definitely a lot of money			2
but , that does n't mean it 's snobbish			1
as someone who does n't really care one way or the other , i just see a lot of really fit men and women working incredibly hard			0
and that 's more than i can say for myself			2
thus , if you want to have your own lingo and dress a certain way , i say go for it			0
tube - sock - a - palooza ! really , i harbor no judgement in support of or in opposition to @entity20			1
i 'm not a health expert , and i 'm literally sitting here writing with a @entity110			0
which is just like a normal @entity110 , but with slightly more type - 2 diabetes			0
so , in general , i just applaud anyone who exercises			0
and i wish i could look as good as the people i see doing @entity20			1
which is why , at first glance , @entity20 for toddlers seems completely fine			1
it 's not like the kids are deadlifting kettle bells or hauling giant bags of dirt around the neighborhood			2
if that was the case , i 'd let the neighborhood kids pay me to clean my backyard			0
" @entity128 , here 's a @entity130 bag			2
now give me 10 more dog poop lifts			0
" instead , at @entity132 in @entity133 -- the affiliate that made news this week -- children starting at 3 years old will focus on traditional @entity20 movements but without any weight			1
the classes will also incorporate counting and colors , as well as bear crawls and crab walking			2
basically , it 's just a bunch of fun kid stuff			2
but with a price tag			0
if your son or daughter attends two classes a week , the fee for the month is $ 280			1
and , that , some argue , makes it all completely unnecessary			0
especially when playgrounds are free			0
we 're simply talking about a fun , organized group activity for kids			0
it 's just like karate or ballet			2
people should n't let their contempt for the word " @entity20 " overshadow that it 's just something active and interesting for children to do			1
and people are certainly free to spend their money however they please			2
but do n't listen to me			0
my kid is a dog			0
and @entity171 's primary workout routine is dropping giant turds on my lawn			0
" @entity128 , grab another @entity130 bag			0
" follow @entity175 on @entity176 .			0

a gym in @entity133 is now offering @entity20 for toddlers
some people think it 's too expensive and snobbish
two classes a week for a month costs $ 280
