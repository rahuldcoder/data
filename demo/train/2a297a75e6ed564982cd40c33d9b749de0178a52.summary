-- the stories coming out of @entity2 , @entity3 , paint an increasingly worrying pictureâ € ” that of a @entity6 city like most any other being turned into a war zone			1
it began with the shooting death of @entity10 by a local police officer			0
the shooting seemed questionable , but the feeling in the community was that the police could not conduct a real , impartial investigation			0
when the police department declined to identify the officer involved , protests began			0
5 things to know about @entity10 's shooting if a listener did n't know any better , he would think the description of events unfolding in @entity2 must surely be taking place in @entity26 or @entity27 € ” combat - armored shock troops shoot tear gas into crowds while snipers train high - powered rifles on groups of civilians from atop heavily armored @entity36 ( @entity36 ) assault vehicles rolling through and blocking off city streets like tanks			1
this is @entity6 , but it does n't look like it anymore			2
@entity43 rep. @entity42 of @entity3 tweeted in the morning , " images & reports out of @entity46 are frightening			2
is this a war zone or a @entity49 city ? gov't escalates tensions w / military equipment & tactics			1
" @entity10 shooting , protests highlight racial divide pictures and videos tweeted out of the " war zone " show what appear to be camouflaged units of soldiers occupying and subduing the outraged civilians of @entity64 € ” but these are not soldiers , they are police officers			1
how could a small local police force act like an occupying military force ? under what is called " @entity70 , " the @entity68 has been doling out military surplus to police departments for use in causes like the domestic " wars " against drugs and terrorism			1
billions of dollars of military arms and armament have been distributed to local police departments since the program started in the late 1990s			2
@entity2 violence : police slammed for ' escalating the situation ' this misguided policy leads to inevitable consequences like what we 're witnessing in @entity2			1
as early as 1999 , the @entity89 warned in a briefing paper , " warrior cops : the @entity92 of @entity93 in @entity94 " that @entity70 is a terrible idea			0
first , dressing police officers as soldiers is dangerous because the mindset of a soldier is entirely inappropriate for a police officer			2
soldiers fight a military enemy ; police officers deal with citizens , who are protected by the @entity105			1
opinion : why @entity2 is your town second , dressing a cop as a soldier does not make him a soldier , it makes him a more dangerous cop			1
@entity115 teams are not military special forces even if they try to act like them			0
police officers simply do not have the training that military troops have , and giving them the arms , armament and attitude of being warriors is simply dangerous			1
third , if cities really need a @entity115 unit , that should be reserved for extraordinary situations beyond the capability of the ordinary patrolman , such as a hostage scenario			0
such @entity115 units should not be deployed for routine policing calls			0
complete coverage on the @entity2 shooting and protests the escalation of conflict in @entity2 did n't have to occur			0
if the @entity68 hands local cops millions of dollars ' worth of hammers , it should be no surprise when suddenly everything looks like a nail			2
we can only hope the situation ends without more violence			0
if president @entity148 wants to do something about the awful events in @entity2 , he should end @entity70 .			0

@entity152 : stories coming out of @entity2 , @entity3 , are worrisome
@entity152 : this small @entity6 city seems to have turned into a war zone
he says @entity68 has been doling out military weapons to police forces across @entity49
@entity152 : this misguided policy makes our cops dangerous and *harmful* to citizens
