or at least that was the plan			2
indie band @entity3 hatched a scheme to earn a big payout from @entity7			1
but they 'd have to be clever ; the music streaming service pays artists less than a penny a play			2
so , here 's what @entity3 did			2
the band uploaded a 10 - song album called " @entity17 " and asked their fans to stream the album on repeat while they slept , hoping to multiply the royalty rate exponentially			1
there was even some incentive			2
the band was going to use the money to pay for a free concert tour and go to the cities that streamed the album the most			1
every track is completely silent -- no music at all -- and only about half a minute long			2
according to the @entity7 's payment plan , each song needs to be listened to for at least 30 seconds to count as an official listen			1
@entity34 ! fans came up big			1
@entity3 racked up about $ 20,000 , according to reports			0
at the half - a - cent per play rate the band says it gets from the service , that 's 4 million plays			1
but not so fast , @entity7 told the band : the album violated its terms of content			1
and " @entity17 " was gone			0
when contacted , @entity7 's @entity45 had little to say			1
not commenting on this one , " he told @entity0			0
there 's no word on whether @entity3 will get paid			0
such a setback might deter other bands			1
it bounced back with a new three - track album called " @entity54			0
" on the first track , " @entity57 , " keyboardist @entity55 spills his guts about the situation			0
" the gist of it was that , while they enjoyed ' @entity17 ' and thought it was funny and clever , that it violated their terms of content , " he said			1
" so i do n't know what 's going to happen with it -- it 's very uncertain at the moment			0
and in light of that uncertainly i want to take 30 seconds silence to ponder the uncertainty			0
" that ushers in the second track , " @entity76 " -- 31 seconds of silence			0
sound familiar ? track three is a 32 - second instrumental called " @entity79 ( @entity80 )			0
" can lightning strike twice ? we 'll see			0
but for a repeat , @entity3 fans will have to hit repeat , again and again and again ...			1
@entity0 's @entity86 contributed to this report .			0
