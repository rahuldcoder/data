a beached whale in @entity2 has tested positive for a virus that likely caused more than 1,200 dolphins to become stranded in shallow water or to wash up on shores , researchers said thursday			1
after the 21 - foot minke whale washed up on the shores of @entity10 on may 1 , a necropsy and subsequent analysis by the @entity7 confirmed that the whale was positive for cetacean morbillivirus , according to the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity2			1
the virus is similar to measles in humans or canine distemper in dogs , according to the @entity21			1
after consulting with disease experts and conducting tests on dolphins in several states , @entity21 determined that @entity26 is likely the cause for 1,283 dolphin " strandings " on the @entity29 since last july			1
for each of the previous five years , there were an average of 253 strandings for that same time period			2
the strandings , where dolphins get stuck in shallow water or wash up on shores , are more than five times the historical average in the affected areas : @entity41 , @entity2 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , according to @entity21			1
some of the stranded dolphins were found alive , but most were found dead , with many in a state of advanced decomposition			1
many dolphins had lesions on their skin , mouth , joints , or lungs , according to data published on @entity21 's website			0
the minke whale , which was tagged with graffiti the night it washed up on the beach , is the first whale that tested positive for the virus in @entity2			1
some were found in other states along the @entity29			1
" we 've had three humpback whales that tested suspect positive , but we 're still waiting for additional lab results			2
two pigmy sperm whales have also tested positive , " said @entity69 , public affairs officer for @entity21			1
@entity71 , the director of the @entity15 , says it 's unclear how the minke whale contracted the virus , but additional testing is being done			2
" minke whales do n't travel in large groups like dolphins do , so it 's still uncertain , " @entity71 said			0
@entity69 said it was unknown whether " it 's a strain of morbillivirus in whales or if it was transmitted from dolphins			2
" @entity21 officials say there is no way to stop the spread of the virus			0
currently , there are no medications or vaccines that could be effectively administered to wild marine populations			0
" we ca n't inoculate every marine mammal in the ocean , " @entity71 said			0
scientists hope that learning more about the virus will help them address factors that may facilitate its spread			0
while the virus is generally spread through the air or through contact with other animals , it is not infectious to humans			2
on august 8 , 2013 , @entity21 issued an @entity106 in response to the high number of deaths			0
the declaration brought special federal attention to the deaths as something that serves as an indicator of ocean health and may give " insight into larger environmental issues which may also have implications for human health and welfare , " according to @entity21 's website			0
the @entity106 declaration for the @entity124 bottlenose dolphins was one of 60 that the agency has issued since it was established under the @entity127 in 1991			0
in 29 of those cases , infections , biotoxins , human intervention and malnutrition , were among the causes determined .			0
