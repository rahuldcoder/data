nearly every piece of plastic still exists on @entity3 , regardless of whether it 's been recycled , broken down into microscopic bits or discarded in the ocean			1
and the world keeps producing more of the material -- creating 288 million metric tons of it in 2012			0
about 4.8 to 12.7 million metric tons of it end up in the oceans in 2010 , according to a new estimate published in the journal @entity14			1
that report released thursday ranks countries that generate the most plastic debris into the oceans , with @entity20 nations taking 13 out of the top 20 spots			1
using @entity24 data on 192 coastal countries , researchers estimated that @entity26 , the most populous nation , has the most mismanaged plastic waste per year and also generates the most plastic debris that end up in the ocean at 28 %			1
mismanaged waste means the material is littered or not properly disposed of -- meaning there is n't a formally managed waste management system			1
" the study is not to point fingers at people , it was n't to focus on the countries , " said lead author @entity33			0
" the purpose was to make a global estimate			0
" but the data set @entity42 and the seven co-authors used was only available on a country - by - country level			0
eight of the top 10 countries with mismanaged plastic waste are in @entity20			1
" many of them are middle - income countries with rapidly growing economy , " said @entity33 of the @entity50			2
" they have also large coastal populations , they have high levels of mismanaged waste , they have trouble keeping up with infrastructure			1
" the @entity61 also cracked the top 20 and had a higher rate of waste generation per person at 5.6 pounds per person than @entity26 ( 2.4 pounds )			1
low - income countries were less likely to end up on the list , because of less waste , @entity33 said			2
since 1974 , the world has undergone a 620 % increase in plastic production , according to the researchers			2
" when the waste was natural material , we could leave it and not think about it , " @entity33 said			2
" even disposing of it in the land was fine , but plastic has increased 650 % in the last 40 years			1
" it 's a wake - up call			0
we need to look at this and the way we 're collecting and containing our waste			2
" plastic waste discarded in the ocean raises a number of concerns , scientists say			1
it may damage ecosystems and marine animals , contaminate our food supply , and lead to chemical leaching			0
estimates of the time it takes to degrade plastic range from hundreds to thousands of years -- and because plastic has only been around for 100 years , there has n't been enough time to observe the process , says @entity103 , senior resource specialist at @entity104 , an environmental group			2
meanwhile , plastic waste keeps on growing with more people and more consumption , the report authors wrote			1
" all that consumption is growing , unfortunately the waste management systems around the world are not keeping pace as quickly as the consumption and products -- there 's a big mismatch , " said @entity109 , who was not involved in the study but has worked on the issue of plastics waste at the @entity113 in @entity114			1
last year , one study in the journal @entity125 estimated that a minimum of 5.25 trillion floating plastic particles weighing 268,940 tons are in the ocean			2
this estimate included only surface plastics , and not the materials that have sunk			0
" a lot of people think of an island of floating garbage , people envision that there are forms of an island you can see on @entity141 -- it 's much more diffuse than that , " @entity103 said			0
" all of our oceans are plastic soups - everywhere you can go			0
" environmentalists have criticized the rampant use of plastics in packaging that are only used once and then discarded			0
the solutions have to be both local and global , @entity33 said			0
" it 's everybody 's responsibility			0
of course , do n't litter and prioritize using reusables , " @entity103 said			0
" at the same time there 's a responsibility on companies who produce the products found in oceans , to make sure the materials they produce are recyclable , get recycled and look for ways to improve the infrastructure			0
" while @entity26 topped the list in the report , the country has made some efforts to curb waste			1
in 2008 , @entity26 banned free plastic bags and five years later , banned the import of poorly sorted recyclables from other countries including the @entity61 there are some successful models , said @entity109			1
for example , @entity178 places a surcharge on plastics sold on a company level and it pays for the sorting , capturing , cleaning and recycling			0
however , some countries lack infrastructure for waste management and recycling .			2

research estimates amount of plastic going from land to ocean
report published in @entity14 ranks @entity26 as top for mismanaged plastic waste
