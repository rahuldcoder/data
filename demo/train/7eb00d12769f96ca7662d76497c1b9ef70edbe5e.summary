the deal , announced on saturday , strikes at the heart of two decades of football broadcasting dominance by @entity3			1
however , it is likely to raise questions about whether @entity1 is paying too much for sports rights , to which it has now committed nearly £ 2 billion ( $ 3.2 billion )			1
the @entity6 is @entity15 's football premier club competition , and @entity1 , @entity3 and @entity16 had all hoped to secure some coverage in this week 's tender			1
under a three - year agreement starting in 2015 , @entity1 will be the only broadcaster to show live @entity6 and @entity22 games in the @entity23 , paying £ 299 million ( $ 479 million ) per season			2
that is more than double what @entity3 and @entity16 currently pay for the same rights , suggesting that @entity1 bid aggressively under its new chief executive @entity29			1
in the tender , @entity16 is thought to have bid about £ 63 million ( $ 101 million ) per season to show one live game per round , representing an increase of less than one - fifth on its current deal			0
@entity3 was prepared to increase its payments by a greater proportion , but could not match @entity1			1
" it seems @entity1 chose to pay far in excess of our valuation , " a @entity3 spokesperson said in a statement			2
" if we thought it was worth more , we 'd have paid more			0
" tv is part of @entity1 's broader strategy to win customers to its premium fibre broadband packages , which include the sports channels for free at present			2
the @entity6 deal will significantly bolster its channels as serious rivals to @entity3 in the eyes of viewers and advertisers			0
@entity1 's shareholders will be keen to see clear returns from such significant investments from a group that has previously focused on cutting costs and streamlining its operations			0
the group last week revealed a good start in customer numbers , with about 2m people so far having signed up to its channels although the majority would have been existing @entity1 customers			0
however , the sports rights acquisitions weighed on earnings , and analysts say it is still too early to judge the new sports tv strategy a success			0
@entity16 , which was also outbid for rights to @entity78 games by the @entity79 , had hoped that @entity15 would continue to offer some rights to terrestrial television , where advertisers can garner a larger audience			0
@entity1 has pledged to make some games , including the @entity6 final , available free even to those who do not have its pay tv platform			1
