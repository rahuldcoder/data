-- @entity3 president @entity2 's secret weapon in @entity4 ? @entity5			1
it seems the quickest way to a country 's heart is by skipping rope in the playground , giggling with high school students , and trying your hand at everything from tai chi to table tennis -- even if you sometimes look a bit silly in the process			2
but hey , at least she 's enjoying herself right ? and in a country where it 's rare to see leaders ' spouses or children in public , mrs @entity22 seems to have charmed its citizens with her approachable manner -- and snappy style			1
as her week - long trip promoting educational exchange wraps up , here are five reasons why the @entity3 first lady absolutely nailed it			1
she 's got sound advice			0
@entity22 had some words of wisdom for young @entity3 students traveling abroad for the first time : " you 're probably going to make a lot of mistakes			2
but you know what ? that 's life			0
and other parts of the world will appreciate your effort and your energy , as long as you come into the experience respecting the people and the culture , " she told @entity0 's @entity52			2
she took her 76 - year - old mom , @entity61			2
and her daughters , @entity63 , 15 , and @entity64 , 12			1
that 's three generations of women , which makes a nice change from the usual line up of male delegates			0
a little background for you : @entity73 is the @entity75 's first live - in grandmother since the 1950s , earning the nickname " @entity74			1
she 's down with the kids			0
from skipping rope in the playground , to throwing some interesting tai chi shapes , and kicking a jianzi ( that 's a weighted shuttlecock to the rest of us ) , it seems there 's not much @entity22 wo n't try			0
and she genuinely seems to enjoy it			0
she 's a cyber champion			0
access to information -- including the internet -- should be a universal right , declared @entity22 during a speech at @entity97 's @entity96			0
it 's quite a ballsy statement , considering @entity4 's " firewall " blocks all websites deemed sensitive			2
but the @entity3 first lady trod a fine line , stopping short of directly criticizing her hosts			1
she 's such a charmer			0
@entity2 who ? mrs @entity22 proved she can hold her own on an international tour , charming people with her warm and open style			1
turns out you do n't need a president by your side to be a number one woman ... watch : @entity22 : the @entity117 see : @entity3 first lady visits @entity120 high school inspire : why @entity22 dances with veggies			1
