-- it may seem like a simple soup - based dish , but @entity4 ramen can be surprisingly complex			1
to chart its different flavors is to embark on a journey along a road of influences and regional variations that has more twists and tangles than a mouthful of noodles			0
sure , there are the basic four ramen styles			2
there 's @entity18 with its heavy soy sauce seasoning ; it 's lighter version , shio ; miso made with salty dollops of fermented soy beans ; and tonkotsu , made by cooking pork bones overnight until the soup is creamy - white			1
venture out into the far reaches of the country , however , and the ingredients change -- what started as a simple four can now be categorized into dozens of local styles			1
ramen emerged as a national food trend in post-war @entity36 as a growing train network took tourists to the country 's far reaches , where they soon began sampling local dishes			2
@entity41 raved about what they were finding on their weekend jaunts , demanding more and ramen shops were quick to cash in			2
@entity46 's miso ramen nowhere did this with as much success as @entity50 , on the northern island of @entity46			1
it was here that in 1955 a customer asked the chef at one eatery , @entity59 no @entity58 ( @entity57 ; +81 11 231 0377 ) to put noodles into his miso soup			2
over the years , the soup got thicker , the curly , yellow noodles were perfected and their popularity spread across the island			0
today , there are miso ramen shops across the country that owe their success to essentially what was an accident			1
the most famous shops in @entity50 still pull in lines down the street			0
@entity78 's shoyu ramen not all ramen in @entity46 is miso			1
just a 90 minute express train ride northeast of @entity50 is @entity78 , a town with enough ramen shops in the vicinity of the station to warrant an official ramen map			1
a completely different style from @entity50 , @entity78 's soup is a hearty shoyu ramen , with a broth made from pork and chicken bones , then mixed with a seafood concoction			1
the style did n't catch on like miso , and most ramen hunters have to head to the source to sample a good bowl			2
the shops credited with inventing the style , @entity101 ( 5 - @entity100 , 7 @entity102 , @entity78 - shi , @entity46 ; +81 16 623 3343 ) and @entity103 ( @entity99 , 2 - @entity104 , @entity78 - shi , @entity46 ; +81 166 23 2820 ) are still doing business			1
@entity109 's curry ramen while @entity50 and @entity112 ramen gained popularity through word of mouth , the city of @entity109 took a more strategic approach			1
after deciding that an unusual curry ramen created in 1965 by local shop @entity59 no @entity117 ( @entity118 2 - 9 - 3 , @entity109 - shi , @entity46 ; +81 143 23 3434 ) had failed to get the attention it deserved , the city in 2006 formed the official @entity122 to promote its wares			1
@entity109 now boasts the fourth most popular ramen recipe in @entity46 ( number three is @entity128 's simple shio ramen )			1
@entity130 's tonkotsu ramen another immensely popular style is tonkotsu from @entity130 in southwestern @entity36			1
simmering pork bones for days on end yields two results : a stench somewhere between fine cheese and old socks , and a creamy , delicious soup			0
@entity139 owes its creation to another happy accident			0
in 1947 a chef at @entity144 , a restaurant in the city of @entity147 , accidentally left a pot of pork bones on high heat for much too long			0
the result was surprisingly tasty			0
@entity153 ramen quickly spread around the island of @entity130 , with two other towns , @entity156 and @entity157 , adapting this style with their own twists			1
in @entity157 , food carts known as yatai embody the local ramen spirit			1
set up daily along the rivers in the @entity166 district , these no - nonsense stands serve bowls of milky - white soup from the time the sun goes down until well into the morning			1
@entity130 's @entity170 @entity156 ramen , though sharing the same roots as @entity157 , is made by mixing in a touch of chicken stock and about two fistfuls of garlic			2
the garlic comes in the form of a black oil called mayu , as well as fried garlic chips served table - side			0
like its cousin in @entity157 , @entity156 ramen is a late night specialty			0
@entity186 's trends of course , @entity186 is a key player in regional ramen styles			2
it 's the ramen battleground of @entity36 , where new shops open and close daily			0
although the hope of kicking off a new ramen trend is quite strong , most outlets stick to the roots of @entity186 ramen -- shoyu , often flavored with niboshi			1
niboshi are dried sardines that give the broth a slightly bitter , fishy taste			0
mixed with a soy base , it 's similar to @entity205 recipes but traces its roots to @entity208 , an area just 10 minutes from @entity186 's busy business center			0
the original @entity208 ramen has spawned countless copies , but its 1931 creator , a shop called @entity215 ( 1 - 4 - 6 @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity186 - to ; +81 33 391 4868 ) , still has lines down the block on the weekend			2
shoyu variations @entity186 is n't alone when it comes to shoyu ramen , although there are , of course , regional variations			1
@entity226 in the north adds copious amounts of niboshi			0
@entity229 , a city in the west of @entity232 , does a lighter - than - average shoyu that finds its way onto the breakfast table in many homes			2
@entity237 adds spicy hot peppers and calls it @entity240			0
@entity241 in @entity243 prefecture dumps mounds of pork back fat onto theirs			0
even @entity249 , a city less than 30 minutes from @entity208 , makes their own style of ramen by adding freshly diced onions into the mix. it does n't stop there			0
new styles are constantly being created and forgotten as chefs try to conjure up the next big thing			0
just when you think you 've tasted them all , there 's always one more bowl to try ... more ramen recommendations : aji no @entity266 , 138 - 3 @entity265 , +81 144 58 3333 @entity267 , @entity268 2 - 17 - 6 , @entity269 - ku , @entity186 - to , +81 33 461 2032 @entity270 , @entity271 2 - 15 , @entity272 - ku , @entity156 - shi , @entity273 ; +81 96 354 8458 @entity274 is a foodie who makes a living performing in children 's events around @entity36			2
a @entity281 native , he 's called @entity36 home since 2006 , and has ventured to almost 1,000 different ramen shops			0
