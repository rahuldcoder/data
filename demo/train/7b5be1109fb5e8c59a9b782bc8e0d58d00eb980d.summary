the @entity1 law that bans adoptions by @entity5 families will take effect in one year instead of this month , @entity1 's semiofficial news agency @entity0 reported thursday			1
in late december , @entity1 president @entity7 signed into law a ban on the adoption of @entity1 children by @entity5 families			1
it was supposed to take effect january 1			0
according to @entity0 , @entity7 's spokesman , @entity14 , said thursday the adoption agreement between the two countries had not expired			1
" the agreement is in force at the moment , " he told the news agency			1
" it will be in force over the course of the year			0
" the @entity23 said a termination clause in the agreement extends one year from the end of the agreement			0
" so that would also take you to 2014 , " department spokeswoman @entity28 said			0
" we are very hopeful that we will be able to complete the cases of adoption that had been begun before the law was passed			0
so that 's something that we will be working on with the @entity1 government			0
" families ' in limbo ' after @entity1 adoption ban @entity0 said 46 such adoptions are under way			2
it was unclear whether any new cases would be approved			0
" as you know , we have been seeking to have consultations with ( the @entity1 ) about the implementation of the law			2
so we will be inquiring of them how they see this , " @entity28 said			0
@entity5 adopted close to 1,000 @entity1 children last year , according to @entity23 figures			1
though the number has been dropping in recent years , @entity1 remains the third most - popular foreign country -- after @entity57 and @entity58 -- for @entity5 foreign adoptions			1
the @entity1 measure also bars any political activities by nongovernmental organizations receiving funding from the @entity5 if such activities could affect @entity1 interests , @entity0 said			2
it also imposes sanctions against @entity5 officials thought to have violated human rights			1
the move is widely seen as retaliation for a bill that @entity5 president @entity71 signed into law on december 14			2
that law , called the @entity73 , imposes @entity5 travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in @entity1			1
the @entity73 is named for @entity1 lawyer @entity77 , who uncovered the largest tax fraud in the country 's history in the form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state			0
@entity77 was apparently beaten to death in 2009 after a year in a @entity88 detention center			0

@entity7 spokesman says adoption pact will end in 2014 , @entity1 news agency reports
