-- a @entity2 report issued thursday called for " decisive action " to contain the growing problem of piracy off the coast of @entity7			1
" we conclude that for too long there has been a noticeable gap between the government 's rhetoric and its action , " said the 210 - page report , issued by the @entity9			1
" despite nine @entity18 resolutions and three multinational naval operations , the counter-piracy policy has had limited impact			2
the number of attacks , the costs to the industry and the price of the ransoms have all increased significantly since 2007			2
" over the past four years , the average ransom has risen from $ 600,000 to $ 4.7 million per vessel , with 2011 's total outlay reaching $ 135 million , the report said			1
those payments " should be a matter of deep concern to the @entity2 government and to the entire international maritime community , " said the report , which described the government as " disappointingly slow to track financial flows from piracy			1
" though some ships have begun taking " more robust " measures to defend themselves , pirates still face few repercussions for their actions , it said			0
in those cases where pirates are detained , some 90 % are released without charge , it said , noting that there is no reason why @entity2 could not assert jurisdiction over suspected pirates			0
simply returning suspected pirates to their boats or to land " provides little long - term deterrence and has demonstrably failed to prevent annual increases in both the number of pirates going to sea and in the number of attacks			0
" the report cited @entity62 , a nongovernmental organization that works with grass - roots organizations in @entity7 , in estimating that 1,500 to 3,000 pirates operate off @entity7 's coast			1
they typically range in age from 15 to 30 and are almost all male , uneducated and unskilled -- many of them from rural areas , it said			0
they often carry small arms and travel in one or two skiffs , the report said , citing capt. @entity77 , head of the @entity78 at the @entity79 , as its source			1
" they will maneuver one of the skiffs to come alongside the vessel and they will throw up a line on a hook , a grappling rope or some form of apparatus by which they can climb up on to the freeboard of the ship			1
if they are detected during that , they will usually fire at the ship , generally in and around the bridge , aiming either to get the master to slow down or to clear their way on to the freeboard			0
once they have got on to the ship , they will proceed to the bridge and take it over			0
" negotiations are typically carried out by satellite phone and usually take three months to a year , it said			0
pirates have begun working from larger vessels , mother ships , which are stocked with food and fuel and have extended the areas vulnerable to attack , it said			0
though most hostages are released unharmed , 15 died last year , it said			0
over the past four years , 3,500 seafarers have been taken hostage and 62 have been killed , it said			2
the report applauded the government 's practice of using a number of different departments to tackle the problem , but said it " lacks clear leadership " and urged the government to " provide a statement clarifying which department has the overall lead on countering piracy			1
" there is no lack of targets			0
some 90 % of the world 's traded materials are shipped by sea , and 40 % of that -- 28,000 ships per year -- goes through the @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 , the report said			1
the report put the annual cost of piracy -- including insurance , prosecutions , security and ransoms -- at $ 7 billion to $ 12 billion			1
in a statement , foreign secretary @entity151 said the report will be discussed next month at a meeting in @entity155			2
" we will use the @entity157 on @entity7 to chart a way forward on the future political direction of @entity7 , the vital humanitarian effort and the international community 's approach to tackling piracy			2

there is " gap between the government 's rhetoric and its action , " the report says
the average ransom has risen from $ 600,000 to $ 4.7 million per vessel in four years
