one of the world 's oldest civilizations took a major step toward democracy wednesday as polls closed in @entity6 's historic vote for president , even as many worried the armed forces would quash the results if the top brass does n't like the country 's choice			1
it is the first time the country has had a presidential election where no one knows what the result will be before the ballots are cast			2
" finally , @entity6 is born , " one weeping 80 - year - old man told rep. @entity22 , a @entity24 @entity23 who is in @entity26 as an election observer			1
@entity28 : is @entity6 ready ? grandmother @entity29 , 70 , was so determined to be the first one to vote at her polling station that she camped out in a plastic chair for 2Â½ hours before it opened			1
" i am here to vote for the first time in my life , " said @entity33			1
" i want to see a new generation for my country			0
i want everything to change			0
" other people told @entity41 they had waited up to four hours to vote as an atmosphere of enthusiasm swept polling stations in the capital			2
@entity6 elections : ' women need a champion ' the voting is a monumental achievement for those who worked to topple longtime president @entity52 in one of the seminal developments of the @entity55 more than a year ago			1
and it could reverberate far beyond the country 's borders , since @entity6 is in many ways the center of gravity of the @entity63 world			1
@entity6 police officers convicted of murder in protest crackdown " @entity6 has always set trends in the @entity63 world and for @entity63 political thought			1
trends spread through the @entity63 world and eventually affect even @entity75 , muslim - majority countries , " said @entity69 , the chairman of @entity70 , a @entity72 - based think tank			1
@entity6 's election " bodes well for the rest of the @entity63 world and particularly those countries that have had uprisings , " said @entity69 , a former @entity76 who was imprisoned in @entity6 for four years for banned political activism			1
there are 13 candidates on the ballot , although two withdrew from the race after ballots were printed			0
if no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the first round , a second round will be held june 16 - 17			2
results of the first round are not expected before the weekend			0
some 30,000 volunteers have fanned out to make sure the voting is fair , said organizers with the april 6 youth movement , which has long campaigned for greater democracy and rule of law in @entity6			2
they reported only minor violations wednesday , mostly supporters of one candidate or another trying to influence voters at polling stations			0
there is a pervasive fear that the powerful military , which has run the country since the fall of @entity52 , could try to hijack the election			2
@entity6 's revolution : ' we fell in love , but it was a trick ' the concern persists despite the insistence of the @entity117 that it will hand over power to an elected civilian government			1
the military put armored personnel carriers on the streets with loudspeakers broadcasting a message that they will relinquish power , but that did not convince doubters			0
@entity69 , the analyst in @entity72 , said @entity6 probably is not heading toward a simple case of the military either giving up control or rejecting the results of the election			1
instead , he anticipated , there will be an " unhappy settlement " where the military remains " ever - present , in the shadows , " influencing the civilian government without controlling it			1
old politics joins new in @entity6 " @entity6 is going along similar lines to @entity145 or @entity146 , " he said , naming two other countries that have formal democracies in place but where a powerful military can affect events			1
the degree to which the military continues to exercise control in @entity6 will depend on who wins the election , @entity69 anticipated -- but he laughed aloud when asked to predict who that would be			1
whoever wins the election , @entity69 said , will face tremendous challenges , even without worries about the army			1
" they are inheriting a failed economy , an abysmal bureaucracy , a frustrated people , and a deep distrust on behalf of the people towards their military and any policing , " @entity69 said			1
and @entity6 has an elaborate political mosaic where alliances shift quickly , he added			2
secular democrats oppose military rule , for example , but if an @entity76 candidate wins the presidency , " some of the democrats would switch because they would rather have military rule than the @entity76 , " @entity69 said			1
opinion : @entity6 's military must stop torturing detainees " it 's far more complicated than ' islamists vs. liberal democracy			1
' it 's rich vs. poor , ( hardline ) @entity183 vs. the ( more moderate ) @entity184 , secularists vs. @entity76 , " he said			0
on top of that , the country does not yet have a new constitution defining the powers of the president or the parliament , after a court last month suspended the committee charged with writing it			0
the court ruled that the members of the committee did not reflect the national population well enough			0
among the candidates vying for the presidency are @entity200 , of the @entity184 's @entity201 ; @entity202 , who served as foreign minister under @entity52 and headed the @entity204 ; @entity205 , a moderate @entity76 running as a respected independent ; @entity207 , who was @entity52 's last prime minister ; and @entity208 , a leftist dark - horse contender			2
@entity207 was mobbed by opponents who threw things at him when he went to vote wednesday , his spokesman , @entity210 , told @entity41			0
" people chanted against him upon his entrance to cast his vote , " @entity210 said			0
that prompted soldiers guarding the polling station to shut the doors while @entity207 voted , he said			0
" on his way out , some people threw their shoes and rocks at him while he rushed into the car , " @entity210 said			0
" he is not hurt , and this attack is not representative of how @entity6 people feel about him			2
" many @entity6 seem uncertain of their loyalties to any particular candidate , and even the weakest of arguments or the strangest of rumors can shift public opinion overnight			2
the vote comes nearly 16 months after the popular uprising that brought down @entity52 in february 2011			0
@entity52 was tried on charges of ordering police to shoot protesters during the uprising against him , and of corruption			0
he is awaiting the court 's verdict and could potentially face the death penalty			0
despite the high - profile trial of the man who ruled the country for 30 years , popular distrust and anger , particularly against the military 's power in @entity6 governmental affairs , still inspire protests , some of which have been marked by deadly clashes			1
protesters are upset at what they see as the slow pace of reform since @entity52 's ouster			0
some are also concerned that the country 's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule			2
in january , two @entity76 parties won about 70 % of the seats in the lower house of parliament in the first elections for an elected governing body in the @entity275 era			0
the @entity201 won 235 seats and the conservative @entity277 gained 121 seats in the @entity279 , according to final results			0
the assembly consists of 498 elected members , and the rest of the seats were divided among other parties .			0
