-- turns out , @entity1 was wrong			0
winning is n't the only thing			0
in some @entity7 cities this season , losing matters even more			1
from @entity9 to @entity10 , from @entity11 to @entity12 , some fans want their team to lose as many games as possible to get the no. 1 pick in the next @entity7 draft , which would give them an opportunity to draft the player who is widely regarded as the most polished prospect at quarterback in years to enter the league			1
or , to use the rallying cry that 's becoming popular , they want their team to " @entity24			2
" his name is @entity27 , and he 's a redshirt junior at @entity28			1
he would have been the no. 1 pick had he declared for the draft after his junior season , when he completed 70.7 % of his passes for 3,338 yards , 32 touchdowns and just eight interceptions			1
he is on pace to match or even top those numbers this season for the @entity38 , which is 6 - 0 and hosts @entity39 on saturday			0
but his value is more than just numbers			0
he has all the tools that make a great quarterback , a 6 - foot - 4 frame with a cannon for an arm , plus a feel for the game beyond his 22 years			0
one player can not transform a football team			0
but every team covets a franchise player at the most important position on the field , and @entity27 , who has another year of eligibility that no one expects him to use , is probably the best to come out of college since @entity58 in 1998			1
even the great @entity58 , however , was n't a lock for the no. 1 pick like @entity27 is in 2012			1
hard as it is to believe , some analysts thought @entity63 , an eventual bust in the @entity7 , was a better choice			2
nobody is a close second this year			0
luck , barring a catastrophe , will go to the team with the worst record in the league			2
" he is the real deal , " @entity72 , the longtime @entity7 analyst and @entity74 coach , said on @entity75 this week			2
" i 've been watching the @entity7 for years , and i do n't remember a more automatic , sure thing			2
" which leads to the " @entity24 " movement			1
the precise origins of that phrase are unknown			0
it has become a @entity84 handle -- @ @entity85 -- which is " imploring the @entity86 or the terrible @entity7 team of your choice to tank for the # 1 overall pick			1
" the @entity86 are the clear favorites in the @entity24 sweepstakes , but hardly the only contender			1
here are the teams with the best shot at sucking enough to get the no. 1 pick , with their odds : @entity9 : not only do the @entity86 ( 0 - 5 ) have a lame duck coach , @entity101 , and an overmatched quarterback , @entity103 , they also have an owner who seems resigned to the quest			1
according to the @entity107 , owner @entity106 has told his friends he 's willing to put up with short - term losses if the end result is the franchise quarterback his team needs			0
odds : 2 - 1			0
@entity10 : @entity115 vice chairman @entity114 recently scouted @entity27 , and with good reason			1
the @entity115 ( 0 - 6 ) are owners of the worst record in football and seem completely hapless without @entity58			1
but @entity58 is expected to return from neck surgery and just agreed to a $ 90 million contract with the team			0
could the @entity115 really draft @entity27 and start him as a backup ? you bet			1
odds : 4 - 1			0
@entity126 : the @entity127 ( 1 - 5 ) rolled the dice in the offseason , acquiring veteran quarterback @entity130 , but he has struggled mightily and will be replaced this week by untested @entity131			2
viking fans have been waiting years for a great quarterback in his prime , and have to be salivating at the prospects of having @entity27 and @entity136 running back @entity137 in the same huddle			1
still , with @entity137 , @entity126 is going to win games this year			0
odds : 8 - 1			0
@entity12 : the @entity141 ( 0 - 5 ) certainly have the suck part covered , but they believe , in young quarterback @entity143 , that they already have their franchise quarterback			1
would they bail on him to grab @entity27 ? hey , they could always trade him			2
but playing in the woeful @entity146 will lead to a few victories for @entity143 and @entity148 : 10 - 1			0
the field : @entity150 ( 1 - 5 ) is off to a slow start but just used the no. 1 pick in the 2011 draft on former @entity155 quarterback @entity154 , who has dazzled at times in his rookie season			1
@entity157 ( 1 - 4 ) has lost four straight games , but made the trade for quarterback @entity160			2
@entity161 ( 1 - 4 ) made the switch to @entity164 quarterback @entity163 , a folk hero for his conservative views , so it seems unlikely the @entity167 would suck enough			2
odds : 15 - 1			0
one other wrinkle : @entity27 's father , @entity170 , is a former @entity7 quarterback himself			1
would the @entity171 try to pull a draft - day power play like some other franchise quarterbacks , including @entity175 and @entity176 , and refuse to sign with a team it deems unacceptable ? until april , it 's all speculation ... and , for the contenders , losing			2
" we do n't really pay much attention to it , to be honest with you , " @entity161 coach @entity181 said this week when asked about the @entity27 sweepstakes			1
" but it 's part of the popularity of our great game of @entity7 football			1
being a competitor , i do n't know many coaches or players to be different			0
you 're trying to win every game			0
" luck , not surprisingly , thinks this entire " @entity24 " thing is ridiculous			1
he returned to @entity28 this season because he loves the college experience , not to create a year of fans hoping for their teams to lose			1
his former college coach @entity202 , now the 49ers coach , has called luck " as good a competitor as you 'll ever see			1
" he is 26 - 5 as a starter			0
" i am aware of it , " @entity27 told the @entity206			2
" a couple of guys told me about it			0
i think it 's stupid			0
" it may be stupid , but it 'll be one of the most - watched storylines of the 2011 season			0
while the teams at the top chase a @entity219 title , ultimately the biggest winner could end up being this year 's biggest loser .			0

@entity28 *senior* and football quarterback @entity27 called no. 1 pick in the next @entity7 draft
" @entity24 " fan movement *encourages* poorly performing @entity7 teams to keep losing
so far the @entity86 , @entity115 , and @entity141 have the worst records
luck is *reportedly* too busy enjoying college life to pay attention , calls campaign " stupid "
