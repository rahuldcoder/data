-- tennis hero , inspiring role model for @entity3 , social activist and high - profile campaigner for the @entity7 and @entity8 communities , @entity9 died in 1993 , but it is a measure of his influence that 20 years on his legacy burns as brightly as ever			1
the main stadium court at @entity14 , where the @entity15 is staged , is named in his honor , a striking statue of @entity9 adorns the grounds , while the @entity19 is a glittering annual bash that kick starts the fortnight for the final grand slam of the season			1
@entity24 was the guest of honor this year			2
his widow @entity26 has made it her life 's work to ensure her late husband 's memory is preserved for generations and the presidential endorsement is the icing on the cake			2
" it makes me very proud that @entity9 has his name raised up for kids who did n't have a clue who he is , " she told @entity0 's @entity38 program			1
" it was such a great honor			2
i 'm born and raised on the south side of @entity46 , as is mrs @entity24 , so to be sitting here next to her with her daughters was just great fun			2
" and that she 's so supportive of the @entity50 and so supportive of @entity9 's legacy			1
" i do n't think we could have asked for a better situation that day , it was just wonderful			0
" @entity26 was sharing her experiences with former @entity3 @entity57 star @entity56 , who has recently retired from the @entity58			0
@entity56 told her that @entity9 has been his idol and inspiration growing up			1
" being an @entity3 playing tennis , his impact on me was great and i wanted to follow in his footsteps , being someone that went to college and was educated and had such a great influence on the world , " he said			0
the impact that @entity56 talks about went far beyond the narrow confines of professional sport			0
@entity9 once famously said " i do n't want to be remembered for my tennis accomplishments " and @entity26 has done her level best to promote his wish			1
" the game of tennis really just gave him a platform to speak about the issues that he cared so much about , " she said			0
" i think he was a role model for a whole lot of kids which is why his legacy is so important to promote today			0
" we do n't want a whole generation of kids today and generations to come to not know that he was more than a tennis player			0
" born in 1943 , @entity9 was brought up in the segregated @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity90 and first tested his tennis skills on a blacks only playground in the city			1
he developed his talent in high school and earned a tennis scholarship to the @entity97 , @entity98 ( @entity97 ) in 1963 , that year becoming the first @entity3 to represent the @entity99 in the @entity57			0
a member of the @entity101 ( @entity101 ) , @entity9 was eventually required to do military service and spent three years in the @entity103 at @entity103 , rising to the rank of second lieutenant			1
@entity9 was still a serving officer when he won his first grand slam title at the 1968 @entity15 , the first of the @entity108 when professionals were also allowed to compete			1
" he was n't just the first @entity3 male to win the @entity15 but he actually was the first @entity3 period to win the @entity15 because the @entity15 did n't begin until 1968 , " @entity26 emphasizes			0
@entity9 was discharged from the @entity112 in 1969 and after winning his second grand slam crown at the 1970 @entity114 turned professional			1
a prominent supporter of the @entity3 civil rights movement , @entity9 's political principles were tested when he was denied a visa by the apartheid government of @entity120 to compete in their national open later that year			1
@entity9 campaigned for @entity120 to be excluded from the @entity123 but although his demands were not met , he was eventually allowed a visa to compete in the 1973 @entity126 , the first black male to do so			1
@entity9 continued to speak out against the apartheid regime and after @entity130 was released having served 27 years in prison , the tennis star returned to @entity120 in 1991 as a member of a 31 - strong delegation to observe the profound political changes in the country			1
he met @entity130 several times and modestly observed : " compared to @entity130 's sacrifice , my own life has been one almost of self - indulgence			0
when i think of him , my own political efforts seem puny			0
" but others would disagree			0
@entity142 , the former united states ambassador to the @entity144 , once famously said of @entity9 : " he took the burden of race and wore it as a cloak of dignity			1
" @entity142 , a pastor turned leading politician , presided over @entity9 's wedding to @entity26 in 1977 after they had met at a charity event just six months previously where @entity26 was attending as a working photographer			1
@entity9 was by then a three - time grand slam singles champion having shocked top seed @entity158 in a epic 1975 @entity160 final , but it was to prove his last as injury and eventual illness took their toll			1
the world was shocked in 1979 when the super-fit @entity9 suffered a heart attack and underwent a bypass operation			2
he was set to return to the tennis tour when further complications arose and he was forced to announce his retirement , doing it in typically fastidious fashion			0
" he had about 30 letters that he had written individually to people , contracts that he had , promises and commitments he had to people , he just wrote them personally and said ' i 'm retiring and i want you to be the first to know , ' " recalled @entity26			0
in retirement , he took over as captain of the @entity184 team , but in 1983 he had to undergo a second round of heart surgery in @entity187			0
it was during his operation that @entity9 is believed to have contracted the @entity7 virus from infected blood transfusions			1
he learned of the diagnosis in 1988 after another health scare , but for the sake of their adopted two - year old daughter camera , @entity9 and his wife kept the illness private			1
only in 1992 was he forced to go public and true to his ideals began campaigning to debunk myths about @entity8 and the way it is contracted			2
he founded the @entity202 for the defeat of @entity8 to build on the work of an institute he had set up to promote public health			2
@entity9 completed his memoir days of @entity208 , finished shortly before his death on february 6 , 1993 from @entity8 - related pneumonia			1
for @entity56 the book was an inspiration			0
" as soon as i read @entity214 it has always been my answer to what 's your favorite book of all time , " he told @entity26			0
@entity142 officiated at @entity9 's funeral in @entity89 , which was attended by thousands of mourners			2
he was buried alongside his mother , @entity221 , who died in 1950 when he was just six years of age			2
later in the year that he died , @entity9 was posthumously awarded the @entity223 by president @entity224			1
it was the first of a string of high profile honors in recognition of a truly remarkable man , but for his widow , who has carried his torch now for so many years , it is his impact on communities and the younger generation which is so important			0
" i think if @entity9 were here today , he would promote tennis on a grass roots level , drawing that metaphor that tennis not just a sport but more importantly a profession that might be able to get you a college scholarship to get you through school , " she said			2
others like @entity56 and @entity247 followed in @entity9 's footsteps on the male side of the men 's game , but @entity26 is equally delighted by the impact the @entity254 ' sisters have had on @entity3 sport			2
" @entity256 and @entity257 , i 'm so proud of what they are both doing			0
@entity256 has her challenges yet she 's moving her life forward and still stays very involved in the game of tennis whenever she can			0
" @entity257 has been i think on top form , not just in tennis but as a person during this particular @entity15 , " she added , reflecting on the @entity265 's 17th grand slam crown			1
@entity26 is hoping the @entity50 , which contains a wealth of her own photographs and memorabilia collected over his life , can find a permanent home			0
" it 's really important that not just today 's generation but generations to come understand him as more than just an athlete , as more than just a patient , as more than just a student and a coach			0
" that they 'll understand the importance of being a well - rounded human being , that you might not be a great champion but if you 're a well - rounded human being then you can do just about anything to succeed in life			0
" @entity9 himself is the perfect example of that , battling his modest background and an undercurrent of prejudice to achieve the highest honor that can be bestowed on an individual in the @entity99			1
" racism is not an excuse to not do the best you can , " @entity9 said and he stands eloquent testimony to the truth of his words .			2
