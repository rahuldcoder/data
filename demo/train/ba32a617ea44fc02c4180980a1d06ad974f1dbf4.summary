-- with its glassy touch screen , powerful graphics , crisp sound and tilt feature , the @entity1 is more than a smart phone for some users -- it 's a portable entertainment system			1
" @entity9 " developer @entity8 demonstrates his game via webcast to @entity0 's @entity12			1
it 's also become a potential gold mine for entrepreneurs who create games for the device			1
just ask @entity8 , developer of the popular puzzle game " @entity9			1
" a former @entity22 software designer for a large bank , @entity8 created " @entity9 " in his spare time and pitched it to @entity26 last spring			1
the company made the game available for download with the july launch of its @entity31 , an online provider of applications for its ipods and iphones			2
priced at $ 5 , " @entity9 " earned @entity8 $ 250,000 in profits the first two months			1
" it 's done phenomenal business , " said @entity8 , 29 , who lives in the @entity37 's @entity36			2
" i 'm very honored that so many people would enjoy my game			0
i get e-mails from 50 - year - old ladies who say , " i do n't play games , but i love @entity9			1
' that 's the coolest thing			0
" it can take dozens of professional developers and millions of dollars to create a video game for a traditional console such as a @entity51 or an @entity52			2
but the @entity1 and the @entity31 have helped democratize game development by opening the field to any software coder with talent and a clever idea , industry observers say			1
" a single one of these titles can be turned around for pennies by comparison in just weeks by a single hobbyist working in their off - hours , " said @entity59 , publisher of @entity60 and author of " get @entity62			0
" " the overhead and barriers to entry are so low that virtually anyone can afford to take a crack , if not several , at hitting a home run			0
" @entity8 took his crack after attending an @entity1 conference in the summer of 2007			1
he spent months afterward brainstorming , by himself and with friends , about how to create an original game for the device			1
once he got the idea for " @entity9 " in february he spent another four months coding the game on nights and weekends			1
the result is a puzzle game , like " @entity86 , " in which players manipulate a colorful grid of triangles			1
players score points by lining up three or more like - colored triangles in a row , with an @entity1 twist : the triangles rearrange themselves depending on which way the player rotates the phone			2
" i did the game myself , basically			0
i had a buddy of mine who actually came up with the name ' @entity9			2
' i paid him a couple of grand			0
but other than that it [ was ] just me , " @entity8 told @entity0			2
" it 's a very simple - to - learn , hard - to - master puzzle game			1
it was n't as hard [ to develop ] as a @entity111 , gun - and - battle kind of game			2
but for the one - man team that i was , it was definitely a challenge			0
" @entity8 quit his bank job two months ago and has launched a company , @entity116 , to develop more electronic games			1
now he has a salaried staff , five games in development and two coming out by @entity121 , including a spinoff to " @entity9 " called " @entity123			1
" " @entity26 has made it so easy to put [ game publishing ] in the palms of developers , " he said			0
" you just make it and then you submit it to @entity26			0
if you have a relevant , fun game or application , i do n't see any reason why it should n't be approved			0
" developers earn 70 percent of @entity31 proceeds from the sale of their games , with @entity26 taking 30 percent			2
the field is getting crowded , though			0
there now are more than 1,500 @entity1 games available from the @entity31 , up from about 900 two months ago			1
" it 's a rich and promising vein that several independent game publishers have been able to successfully tap , " said @entity142 in an e-mail interview			0
" however , success stories remain the exception , not the norm -- as with any gold rush , what we 're presently seeing is a massive number of prospectors looking to stake their claim			0
" many of the overnight successes we 've witnessed enjoyed the benefits of timing and visibility , advantages quickly being eroded due to market oversaturation , " @entity59 added			0
" let 's put it this way : i would n't tell anyone to quit their day job just yet			0
as with any @entity173 story , chances of recreating this kind of success are few and far between			0
