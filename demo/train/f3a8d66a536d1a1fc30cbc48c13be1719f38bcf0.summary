-- in a dusty corner of southern @entity6 's @entity5 refugee camp , the pounding beat of a skin drum drives a group of young men through a cluster of brick - made huts and into a makeshift soccer field			1
they 're summoned here , however , not to kick a football but to engage in an uplifting activity that can help them forget the tough conditions they live in : dancing organized by @entity6 dancer and choreographer @entity20 , these dance workshops are helping scores of displaced people to regain their self - confidence , while having fun and and finding a way of expressing themselves			1
" the first time that i was at the refugee camps , the people were all quiet and in their tents			1
and now with the dance project , everyone came out , i think it has also changed their outlook , " says @entity20 , an acclaimed dancer in his own right who has graced stages across @entity35 and internationally			1
landlocked in north @entity35 , the @entity6 is one of the poorest countries in the world			1
along with poverty and drought in the @entity48 desert , hundreds of thousands of people have been uprooted , due to violence , corruption and civil war			0
@entity6 's migrant workers pay price for @entity55 conflict in 2005 , @entity20 , who began dancing at the age of 13 , created the dance company " @entity57 , " which means " dance together " in @entity58 , a local language in southern @entity6			1
he initially launched a project where he used dance sessions as an educational tool to help children abstain from violent activities while at school			0
the success of the sessions prompted him to take his dance workshops to refugee camps along the border with the @entity71 , introducing the joy of dance to its traumatized residents			1
" the idea came to me after reading articles about refugees in @entity78 , " he says			0
" the children were exposed to war -- seeing weapons , nothing but war , the kids are traumatized			0
and the idea i had was , why ca n't i adapt this dance workshop for the refugee camps , to give the children an outlet , a way to have fun and to have a life			1
" according to the @entity93 , @entity6 has been affected by a humanitarian crisis since 2001			2
statistics reveal an alarming picture as the country had more than 300,000 refugees in 2010 , according to the @entity93 high commissioner for refugees			0
@entity101 's first black dean teaches ' reconciliation over revenge ' in 2006 @entity20 reached out to the @entity93 refugee agency for help with his dance workshops in the camps			1
he was then told to launch a pilot project in @entity109 , an area with two large refugee camps sheltering thousands of people			1
" i was asked to test the project and that there were n't any resources for it but that i had to go try and see how it could work			0
so when my pilot project launched , the refugees were curious , they wanted to know what i was planning on teaching them , " says @entity20			2
the project was a quick success : in the @entity127 refugee camp 181 people of all ages signed up to @entity20 's dance workshops , followed by 76 refugees at the @entity131 camp			1
after the sessions ended , the refugees demanded @entity20 's return to the camp to continue teaching them how to dance			2
" i see there is hope because this dance that i am doing will help me earn an income , " says 19 - year - old refugee @entity136 who has lived in a refugee camp for the past four years			0
" it will enable me to carry on with my studies , " adds @entity136 , who attends school in the local village and has every intention of furthering his studies next year			0
last october , @entity20 also teamed up with friend and colleague @entity148 -- director of the @entity150 -- to start a project together called " refugees on the move			2
" the goal is to create a chain reaction and extend @entity20 's dance workshops to other countries in @entity158			1
" through dance we are trying to bring hope to troubled youths and try to reduce violence and bring a sense of social interactions , " says @entity148			0
@entity167 rapper @entity166 makes songs in the key of love inside the camp , @entity20 's dance lessons are life lessons , teaching people of all ages important skills as well as encouraging hygiene and education			2
@entity20 also does n't shy away from sensitive issues , raising awareness on hiv / aids , women 's rights , hygiene and education			1
" what makes me the proudest is to see them smile , dance and laugh , " says @entity20			2
" when i dance i see others who laugh and from time to time i laugh ! i 'm only interested in this			0
" @entity20 has succeeded in giving the refugees that they need as much as food and shelter -- their sense of humanity and belonging			0
" i 've always said that for me , dance is something magical , that does n't have barriers			0
