-- @entity1 defended her controversial comment that sen. @entity4 's campaign was successful because he was black , telling an interviewer tuesday that she was being attacked because she was white			1
comments by former rep. @entity1 are drawing criticism from the @entity4 campaign			1
" any time anybody does anything that in any way pulls this campaign down and says , ' let 's address reality and the problems we 're facing in this world , ' you 're accused of being racist , so you have to shut up , " she told the @entity9 of @entity10 , @entity11			2
" racism works in two different directions			0
i really think they 're attacking me because i 'm white			2
how 's that ? " in another interview tuesday , she compared @entity4 's situation to her own 24 years ago , when she was the first female candidate for vice president			1
she told a @entity32 interviewer , " i got up and the question was asked , ' why do you think @entity4 is in the place he is today " as the party 's delegate front - runner ? " i said in large measure , because he is black			2
i said , let me also say in 1984 -- and if i have said it once , i have said it 20 , 60 , 100 times -- in 1984 , if my name was @entity42 instead of @entity1 , i would never have been the nominee for vice president , " she said			2
in her first interview with @entity9 , published late last week , @entity1 said , " if @entity4 was a white man , he would not be in this position			1
and if he was a woman , he would not be in this position			0
he happens to be very lucky to be who he is			0
and the country is caught up in the concept			0
" she also said @entity54 had been the victim of a " sexist media			0
" @entity4 himself has called the comments " patently absurd			1
" " i do n't think @entity1 's comments have any place in our politics or in the @entity62			1
they are divisive , " he told the @entity63			0
" i think anybody who understands the history of this country knows they are patently absurd			1
and i would expect that the same way those comments do n't have a place in my campaign , they should n't have a place in sen. @entity75 's , either , " he added			1
earlier , @entity4 's top strategist , @entity76 , called for @entity75 to sever ties with the former @entity79 congresswoman , who serves on her campaign 's finance committee			1
" when you wink and nod at offensive statements , you 're really sending a signal to your supporters that anything goes , " @entity76 said			0
@entity76 said the comment by @entity1 , coupled with @entity75 's " own inexplicable unwillingness " to deny that @entity4 was a @entity89 during a recent interview , was part of " an insidious pattern that needs to be addressed			1
" @entity1 could not be reached for comment			2
@entity75 told @entity94 that she did not agree with @entity1 's comments			1
" it is regrettable that any of our supporters on both sides , because we 've both had that experience , say things that kind of veer off into the personal , " she said			0
" we ought to keep this on the issues			0
there are differences between us			0
there are differences between our approaches on health care , on energy , on our experience , on our results that we 've produced for people			0
that 's what this campaign should be about			0
" the former congresswoman is the latest @entity75 surrogate to launch a firestorm with comments that related to @entity4 's heritage or ethnicity			1
@entity75 's husband , former president clinton , drew sharp criticism from black leaders for a series of comments he made before the @entity131 primary , including comparing @entity4 's campaign to the rev. @entity134 's 1984 run			1
former @entity136 sen. @entity135 , a major @entity75 backer , said several times that an @entity4 presidency would improve the world 's image of the @entity141 because of the @entity144 senator 's @entity89 roots			1
@entity4 , however , said @entity135 's comments were intended to highlight @entity4 's @entity89 heritage in voters ' minds			1
and shortly before the @entity151 primary , 84 - year - old @entity75 supporter @entity149 told @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity151 , that @entity4 would have trouble attracting @entity156 support because he was @entity157			2
" when blacks had the numbers , they did n't do anything to support us , " @entity149 said			0
" they always used our numbers to fulfill their goals and objectives , but they never really supported us , and there 's a lot of hard feelings about that			0
i do n't think we 're going to get over it anytime soon			0
" last month , when @entity54 was asked whether she would reject and denounce @entity149 's remarks , she said , " people get to express their opinions , " adding that " a lot of folks have said really unpleasant things about me over the course of this campaign			0
" later , her campaign released a statement saying that she had been unaware of the substance of the remarks during that interview and both denounced and rejected them			0
@entity4 has faced his own headaches			2
foreign policy adviser @entity189 ended her connection with his campaign last week after telling a @entity193 interviewer that @entity75 was a " monster			2
" @entity189 also made remarks about @entity4 's iraq war policy that were used by the @entity75 campaign in recent attacks			1

new : @entity1 says she is being attacked because she is white
she says @entity4 would not be a candidate if he were white
@entity4 has called the comments " patently absurd "
@entity75 says she disagrees with @entity1 's comments
