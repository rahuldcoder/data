-- one international peacekeeper was shot dead and another was wounded early sunday after a " gang " attacked their police post inside a refugee camp in @entity10 's embattled @entity9 region , the @entity2 - @entity1 said			1
the incident came amid continued fighting , much of pitting armed militia groups against @entity15 government forces in the region , which is near @entity10 's border with the new nation of @entity10			2
late last week , for instance , @entity20 officials said all 25,000 people living in another @entity9 refugee camp -- this one the @entity25 camp , in north @entity9 -- fled due to ongoing violence			1
as to the latest incident , the joint mission , known as @entity28 , said in a statement sunday that a " gang surrounded " its community policing center inside the @entity34 refugee camp in @entity35 , @entity9			1
the armed men then began shooting , killing a peacekeeper from @entity38 around 3:15 a.m. and wounding another , according to @entity28			1
the infiltrators fled the scene after the @entity2 - @entity20 police unit returned fire , the mission said			1
" the attack on our peacekeepers is cowardly ( and ) deplorable and our thoughts go to the families and friends of the fallen and the injured , " said @entity50 , acting joint special representative for the mission			2
@entity50 urged @entity10 's government to make a concerted bid to apprehend those responsible for the shooting , which she called a war crime under international law			1
violence has plagued @entity9 for nearly a decade			1
the @entity1 estimates as many as 300,000 people have been killed and almost 3 million people have been displaced from their homes since the @entity9 conflict broke out in 2003			2
in march of this year , the @entity64 issued an arrest warrant for @entity10 's defense minister for 41 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed in the @entity9 region			1
@entity15 president @entity72 is also wanted for crimes against humanity by the @entity64 in connection with the conflict			0
@entity74 , head of media relations for @entity28 , told @entity0 late last week that there was a drop in civilian casualties between 2010 and 2011 in @entity9 , " but recently there has been an uptick in criminal activity			2
" " the situation is troublesome , it is not supposed to be happening in @entity9 , but there is still fighting going on , " @entity74 said			0
a @entity28 statement issued last monday said the latest round of violence began after an incident on august 1 , when three armed men carjacked the local district commissioner and his driver and shot them dead			0
" subsequently , on the same day armed men surrounded @entity25 , looted the market , burnt down the @entity15 police post in the camp and reportedly killed four persons ( three civilians and one police officer ) and injured six others , " the statement said			0
security continued to deteriorate over the following days in @entity104 town , @entity25 camp and another camp , @entity107 , " including fighting between the armed elements and government forces , as well as looting and displacement of civilians , " it said			0
@entity35 , where the early sunday morning attack occurred , is about 300 kilometers ( 185 miles ) south of @entity104			0
according to a paper published last month by the independent monitoring group @entity118 , violence has picked up of late since new @entity119 " @entity125 " have been recruited , trained and armed by the @entity15 government since late 2010 to force @entity122 rebel groups out of a swath of the eastern @entity9 region			1
as a result , about 70,000 people had been displaced by mid- 2011 , and retaliatory attacks by both sides continue , the group said in its paper			0
meanwhile , aerial bombardment has been used to target rebel forces and civilian villages believed to support them , in defiance of @entity137 resolutions			0
weapons and ammunition also continue to flow into the hands of proxy forces and government forces in defiance of a " wholly ineffective " embargo on @entity9 , the group reported			0
@entity0 's @entity146 contributed to this report .			0
