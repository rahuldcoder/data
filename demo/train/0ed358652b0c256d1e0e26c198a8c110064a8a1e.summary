-- for years as he chased his dream , shooting hoops and racing up and down the court , professional basketball player @entity1 wore the no. 98 jersey			1
it was a personal gesture , a way of remembering @entity8 , a gay college student whose own dreams were ended in 1998 , when he died after being tied to a fence post , beaten and tortured			1
but when @entity1 came out as the first openly gay @entity13 player in history , that number suddenly took on a broader significance			1
