-- as they seek solace from the ignominy of a ban from representing their country because of a drinking bout , six @entity2 rugby internationals might just have been served the perfect tonic - knowing that they are not part of the country 's @entity12 team			1
a day after a total of 15 players were disciplined for breaching ' internal team protocol ' , the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) issued guidelines about how its own athletes should behave at @entity20 after the consumption of alcohol			1
there is to be no ' swaying , staggering or falling down ' while rambling or boisterous conversations , annoying team members and difficulty in paying attention to others are also outlawed			0
while drinking may be permitted outside the @entity30 , team members have been left in no doubt as to the expectations now placed upon them			0
" these restrictions have been implemented to ensure that @entity38 's @entity12 athletes are given the opportunity to compete to the best of their ability and with distinction , " said a statement bearing the name of @entity14 president @entity35			1
the failure to comply with these directives , which include the non-consumption of any alcohol in the @entity12 village , would likely lead to expulsion from the team camp			0
the first test for @entity2 athletes will come at the @entity52 in @entity53 in february			2
the measures came after a 2012 @entity12 where some @entity2 athletes were criticized for their drunken behavior at an @entity52 where the nation collected its lowest medal haul in 20 years			1
the swimming team 's drunken behavior was particularly frowned upon following an independent review , while a rower was detained by police for damaging shop windows after a drinking session			0
last week , it was the turn of @entity38 's rugby players to hit the headlines for their drinking			1
veteran international @entity70 was one of the six suspended , along with @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			0
while the latter will miss the match against @entity80 later this month , the remaining five will all miss this weekend 's clash with @entity82			0
yet the extent of the consumption of what coach @entity85 called " inappropriate levels of alcohol " went even further , with a further nine players warned as to their future conduct			1
" let 's be clear - these are internal sanctions and are n't a result of any complaints or reports of inappropriate or sinister behavior while our players were out , " said the former international			2
" we 've done this because we need to continually reinforce the need for our players to make smart decisions to benefit the team			0
" the worst thing you could do for the @entity38 in the long term is nothing , because that would mean we would be ignoring poor culture and a significant performance issue			0
" despite the drinking spree , which took place early on wednesday morning of last week , @entity38 defeated @entity111 32 - 15 in @entity112 three days later , with @entity72 among the try scorers			2
several @entity2 rugby players have been involved in drinking incidents in recent times , including @entity117 -- who lost his contract with the national team as a result -- and @entity121 , who has sought counseling for his problems .			1
