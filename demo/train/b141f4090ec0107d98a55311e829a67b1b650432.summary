-- as easier - to - extract fossil fuels are depleted , techniques that involve more effort , environmental destruction and carbon emissions are being developed			2
each new wave of more extreme extraction methods , be it tar sands , deep water drilling or mountain top removal , brings a new level of destruction to the area concerned			0
in the @entity17 , gas production from the @entity16 is in terminal decline			1
prices have risen and consumption is falling			0
it is within this context that the @entity17 government has proposed building up to 40 new gas - fired power stations in the hope that some unconventional gas will be found to fuel them			1
this apparently insane gamble does have some , admittedly warped , reasoning behind it			0
the threat to the energy corporations , whose influence in government is huge , is not energy shortages , from which they will profit handsomely , but sensible energy conservation which will make people less dependent on them			1
whatever the outcome of that gamble , higher prices and less gas are assured , but the destruction of communities and the environment however , is something we do have a choice about			2
in the @entity50 , the shale gas boom is fast turning into a bust			1
fracking companies are losing money hand over fist , drilling has slumped , prices are rising and gas production looks set to decline			0
the drop in demand due to the 2008 recession is what has lowered @entity50 natural gas prices and emissions , not shale gas			1
it is clear that the idea being pushed of a shale - fuelled economic miracle is just so much hot air , fuelled by the usual irrational exuberance			2
the impact which a desperate scramble for unconventional gas will have on the @entity17 would be profound			1
the tens of thousands of wells and thousands of miles of pipelines would have a vast greater impact than has been seen in the @entity50 or @entity76			1
the @entity17 is one of the most densely populated countries in the world			2
as the evidence of water contamination , air pollution and health effect from the @entity50 and @entity76 mounts up , people in the @entity17 are scared			1
the @entity17 government is preparing to sell off over half the country for fracking in the next year			2
it has instituted an @entity88 to cut though what little regulations previously existed			0
plans are also afoot to take planning decisions about these developments out of the hands of regional governments so that local communities will have even less influence of the outcomes			0
on a global scale the threat from the exploitation of unconventional gas is even more dire			1
we can not afford to burn the all the conventional fossil fuel reserves			0
the three main unconventional gas techniques are shale gas , coal bed methane ( @entity109 / @entity108 ) and underground coal gasification ( @entity111 ) , which literally involved setting fire to coal seams underground to exploit the energy released			1
between them they could unlock enough carbon to cause a five to 10 degrees celsius global temperature increase			1
in the @entity17 , as with many countries around the world , ordinary people are organizing to resist this invasion of their communities			2
groups are being formed , public meetings are being held , films are being made and protests are being organized			0
people in the @entity17 do not believe that their health and well - being should be sacrificed for the profit of a few			1
we take particular heart from @entity76 where a growing movement of organized communities appears to having some success in resisting the spread of fracking companies			0
the message is clear -- fracking and associated extreme energy methods like tar sands extraction , are intrinsically destructive to people and the planet			0
they must and will be opposed wherever they are being imposed on communities			0
in the end , fracking is a road to nowhere and the sooner we start heading back towards safety ground the better it will be for all of us .			0

@entity17 *campaigners* : shale gas exploration have greater impact in @entity17 than in @entity50
@entity157 : unconventional gas unlocking could cause huge global temperature rise
group : health and well - being of people in @entity17 should not be sacrificed for profit of a few
