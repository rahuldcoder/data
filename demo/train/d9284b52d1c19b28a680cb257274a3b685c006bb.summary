-- when it comes to the horror of bringing a playoff system to the big boys of college football , there are several things for members of the @entity9 to think about			1
the problem is , they do n't wish to think			0
mostly , they fume over the current system that chooses a national champion through a combination of polls and computers with the so - called @entity20			2
they say a playoff system is the best way to determine a champion on the field , and they are correct			1
but only if you ignore things you have to ... think about			0
for instance : name those screaming the loudest about a playoff system for the @entity32 , the @entity33 and the @entity34			1
schedule of 2011 - 12 college bowl games the fans ? yep , because they are , well , fans			2
in their minds , a playoff system gives them the chance to add millions to their millions			1
they have airwaves , cyberspace and newsprint to fill , and if you 're @entity55 or the networks , a playoff system gives you the chance to add billions to your billions			1
guess who gets ignored ? the players			0
pro players get paid for their sacrifices regarding extra games , but college players do n't			2
and that 's just for starters			0
consider that every team in the @entity69 ( formerly @entity69 ) has about 120 players			0
on the high side , an average of five or six of those players make @entity75 training - camp rosters			2
of the nearly 110 left , maybe 40 believe they should have made an @entity75 training - camp roster			2
so , a large portion of that 40 joins those five or six in spending more time studying playbooks than textbooks			1
that leaves roughly 70 student - athletes on a team each season doing whatever it takes to get a degree -- and it takes a lot for that group , even without an extra game or three			1
just one extra game means a slew of more practices , film sessions and team meetings for those student - athletes			1
" a playoff system certainly would have its challenges , and it 's already a challenge now , " said @entity96 , a four - year starter at running back for @entity98 he is a three - time @entity101 - @entity100 player , and he has earned his undergraduate degree in management along the way to seeking an mba			1
not only that , @entity96 is part of an advisory council involving @entity98 athletes and administrators			2
he said an average day for a football student - athlete can start as early as 6:30 a.m. , stretch through the end of a tutoring session at 9 p.m. and continue with more studying at the dormitory			1
" @entity118 management is the biggest thing , " @entity96 said			2
" people just see the games on saturdays , but we 're practicing monday through friday , and we have classes every day as well			2
a traditional student has the weekend to get a project done			2
we do n't have that liberty , because we 're in a hotel on fridays , getting ready for the games			0
it can be a mental grind			0
" and that 's without a playoff system			1
that 's also coming from @entity96 , among the elite of student - athletes , who added , " a lot of those games with playoffs would come during finals weeks or at other times that are very stressful for any student , particularly for a student - athlete			1
" ok , so you could n't care less whether @entity144 can read or write			0
you just want to know whether @entity144 can punt , pass or kick			0
tell me this : a playoff system would have how many games , and who 's to say it would n't keep expanding before expanding some more ? while several athletics directors want a " plus one " approach featuring a championship game after the 35 bowl games , others want two semifinal games and then a championship game			1
president @entity159 wants eight teams playing three rounds			0
@entity163 coach @entity162 wants 64 teams			0
no doubt , others would n't mind putting all of the @entity69 's 120 teams in the postseason			0
where would you play these games ? the site of current bowl games , you say , or maybe @entity75 stadiums , neutral sites or various places on the dark side of the moon ? how many -- if any -- of these locations would be available ? if you use bowls , which ones ? and since the bulk of the tv and advertising revenue would flow to playoff games , what would happen financially to the bulk of the bowls without playoff games ? how would you choose the participants for a playoff system , and would n't that create more controversy ? i know			1
they have a playoff system in college basketball called @entity196 , but here 's something else i know : the academic status of participating dribblers often has been a disaster			1
in fact , if the new academic rules that the @entity204 adopted this fall were in place last spring , @entity202 would n't be allowed to defend its national championship			0
@entity202 barely would have made the tournament			0
i also know they have a playoff system for the lower levels of college football			1
the one for the @entity215 ( formerly @entity216 ) began november 26 , and it will end with the championship game january 7			0
here 's something else i know : the last @entity204 report on the financial status of its schools at the highest level was for the 2009 - 10 season , and it showed that only 22 out of those 120 athletics departments turned a profit			0
which raises the question : how many football programs for those schools would agree to lose revenue by slicing regular - season games to keep a playoff system from lasting until @entity235 ? zero			1
oh , and home attendance in the playoffs for teams at those lower levels is frequently lower than their regular - season games			1
such was the case last season for traditional @entity215 powers @entity245 and @entity246 , and such is the case this year for @entity248 , according to its sports information department			0
i say that because @entity252 fans dominated the @entity253 this month for the @entity255 title game			0
their @entity257 counterparts were sparse			0
word back in @entity259 was that @entity257 fans were saving their money for the @entity20 title game next week in @entity263 between @entity257 and @entity264			0
which raises another question : how many folks would travel multiple times to see their team during a playoff system involving the big boys ? the answer ? just leave the current system alone			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity276 .			2

a playoff system for college football would be a big *mistake* , says @entity276
for one thing , student - athletes would have even less time for studying , he says
@entity276 : where would you play the games ? and how would participants be chosen ?
home attendance in the playoffs for teams at lower levels is frequently low , @entity276 says
