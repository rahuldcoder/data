@entity0 , @entity1 -- in recent weeks , there have been two important stories developing about the 2012 campaign			2
on the surface , they have nothing to do directly with @entity9 , @entity10 or @entity11			2
the stories revolve around money			1
@entity14 , a political action committee founded by @entity15 , is gearing up so that it can provide campaign funds to @entity18 candidates across the nation			2
the organization is determined to repeat its accomplishments in 2010 , just on a much grander scale			2
on the other side of the aisle , there have been stories about big bundlers who are raising enormous amounts of money for president @entity32 's re-election campaign			1
according to the @entity37 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 are among the 100 - plus bundlers who have raised more than $ 50 million for the president			2
according to the @entity42 , the financial and banking sectors have given president @entity32 more money than all the @entity18 candidates combined			1
seems like @entity45 is not that scared of a second term			1
with all the ups and downs of the last decade , one thing has been constant			0
private money continues to flood the political system			1
as a result of the @entity55 's decision to eliminate the ban on corporate spending , the problem will only get worse			0
the vast amount of private money in @entity61 politics causes enormous problems for the nation			1
there are many problems that money makes it more difficult for the government to resolve			1
the power of private money , and the enormous influence of the interest groups and individual donors who provide it , prevents government from tackling fundamental issues of the day , including issues where there would otherwise be some agreement between the two parties			1
for all the talk about reducing the long - term deficit and rationalizing federal spending , the chances of accomplishing this goal are minimal unless the campaign finance system is repaired			0
interest groups in @entity86 fight hard to defend the status quo			0
one of the classic examples of what political scientists called the " iron triangle , " â € ” the ironclad alliance between interest groups , government agencies and congressional committees in defense of specific programs â € ” has been the defense budget			1
since the @entity100 , federal dollars have gone to defense contractors who reap huge profits from the production of certain weapons systems			0
these companies have become integral to the economy of the communities in which their plants located , and they are protected by the legislators who represent those areas as well as @entity113 officials			0
agricultural programs are another case where lobbying makes innovations or reductions in spending difficult			0
the congressional supercommittee dealing with deficit reduction is spinning its wheels			0
indeed , @entity122 reported that members of the deficit reduction committee are receiving sizable amounts of contributions from special interest groups , many of which represent sectors ( such as health care ) that are opposed to what the panel is attempting to accomplish			0
without addressing the political dynamics that have fueled many of today 's budgetary problems , it will be difficult for @entity137 to enact substantial changes , or to make sure that any successful reforms last over time			0
a second problem is the power of financial and business interests in @entity86			1
this is a theme that preoccupies both @entity146 and @entity147 activists			0
why did @entity45 receive so much assistance through @entity149 while homeowners have been allowed to languish ? protesters on the right and left talk about how policies are skewed toward these interests and how average middle - class @entity61 do n't receive the same kind of attention from the nation 's leaders			1
business and financial interests achieve their influence in many ways			1
but their ability to deliver dollars to the campaign chests of candidates is crucial			0
donating funds helps to ensure that these interests have a seat at the table			1
in 2009 , as @entity172 recounts in his new book , " @entity174 , " @entity175 learned firsthand as the health care industry successfully pushed the administration to eliminate crucial measures that were intended to control costs and save money to pay for expanded insurance			1
this story has been repeated in a number of policy sectors			0
the final problem that money fuels is gridlock			1
everyone hates when @entity137 does n't seem capable of doing anything			1
a chronic complaint about @entity86 is that the parties are so polarized that agreement is not possible			0
money is one of the culprits			2
political scientists have shown how the money race pushes politicians to seek favor with ideologically oriented interest groups and political action committees who can deliver funds			2
legislators need to make sure that the party leadership in each chamber , which maintains centralized control over money through leadership political action committees , will keep the purse strings open			2
campaign money makes help certain that the parties are heard			2
without tackling core issues such as campaign finance , gridlock that @entity61 seem to dislike so much will continue			1
when he was a candidate , @entity32 constantly reminded voters about this problem			0
now he seems to have become comfortable or resigned to working within the system that he once criticized			0
at the height of the struggle over campaign finance reform in 1973 , sen. @entity221 warned that " it is a cesspool , it is a source of infection for the body politic			0
" one year later @entity228 shattered @entity61 confidence in the political system			1
the result was burst of reform that created public finance for presidential campaigns and contribution limits , as well as the @entity236			0
for almost two decades , the system worked relatively well and did produce changes until recently when both parties abandoned it			0
right now there is no scandal comparable to @entity228 to move @entity61 politicians			1
with all the attention that we pay to the horse race between @entity10 , @entity9 and @entity248 or the decline in president @entity32 's approval ratings , the fundamentals receive little attention			0
the basic ways in which politics works , the underlying sources of political influence and power that will have huge effects on whoever the next president is , are barely an issue			2
without reform , the chances that we will see huge shifts in policy to make government more efficient and more effective are slim			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity270 .			1

@entity270 : the flood of money into @entity61 politics is a scandal
he says money from powerful interests prevents rational *choices* on budget cutting
it helps *explain* why @entity45 got *bailed* out , and @entity61 homeowners did n't , he says
