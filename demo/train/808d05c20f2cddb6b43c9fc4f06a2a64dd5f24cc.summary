-- owning a professional sports franchise is my dream job			2
( i 'm willing to relocate			2
) of course , i could never afford my own team			2
there 's a better chance i 'll miraculously develop an unhittable slider , or learn to punt			1
@entity9 team owner @entity8 got his start in the paper business			1
you obviously must be exceedingly wealthy to become an owner			1
did you ever wonder how all these people made all that money ? i sure hope you did , because we went and did all this research			2
here 's a list of nine billionaire owners and how they built their fortunes			1
@entity21 , @entity22 ( @entity23 ) in 1959 , @entity21 and high school friend @entity24 started selling all - purpose cleaner			1
their business grew to become @entity28 , which now brings in $ 6 billion each year under the ominous - sounding @entity30 name			0
whether you see @entity28 as an empowering direct sales company or a something resembling a cult , it sure was good to @entity21			0
@entity36 estimates his wealth at $ 3.5 billion , making the paltry $ 85 million he spent on the @entity22 in 1991 a minor investment			0
@entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity23 ) lower on my list of dream jobs is running a cable network that caters to urban youth			0
so i 'm all kinds of envious of @entity41 , who founded @entity50 and sold it to @entity51 for $ 3 billion in 2001			0
his fortune was depleted by an expensive divorce , but @entity41 's estimated net worth is still $ 1.1 billion			1
his resume is full of firsts @entity50 was the first @entity58 owned company traded on the @entity59			0
he was the first @entity61 - @entity60 billionaire in the @entity60 and , in 2002 , he became the first african - american majority owner of a professional sports franchise			2
@entity8 , @entity64 ( @entity9 ) i 'd never given it much thought , but i 'd always assumed @entity67 bought the @entity64 with big cheese money he 'd inherited			1
but @entity67 got his start in the paper business			0
his wife , @entity72 , is the daughter of @entity74 philanthropist @entity73			0
after @entity67 finished @entity75 , he went to work with his father - in - law 's packaging company			2
in 1972 , @entity67 founded @entity78 , which is now part of the @entity80 -- a diversified collection of companies ranging from @entity83 to the @entity84 ( @entity85 ) to @entity86 ( @entity88 's largest packaging plant )			2
@entity67 is seen as a savior in @entity64 -- before he bought the team in 1994 , the @entity64 seemed destined for relocation to @entity92			0
plus he 's made them really , really good , winning three @entity94 this decade			1
another reason i 'm so keen on owning a team is the access to foreign heads of state			0
in 2005 , @entity67 met @entity100 , who walked off with one of @entity67 's @entity94 rings			1
@entity67 now claims it was a gift , but that might just be what you say when a @entity108 leader steals your jewelry			1

@entity113 , @entity114 ( @entity115 ) despite @entity60 's strong resistance to @entity118 ownership -- and despite his admitted lack of interest in baseball -- @entity113 became majority owner of the @entity114 in 1992			1
@entity113 is the man credited with transforming @entity123 from playing - card company to video game giant			0
his 55 - year tenure saw incredible growth			0
but that does n't mean there were n't a few bumps along the way			0
forays into instant rice , taxi service and short - stay hotels ( also known as " love hotels " ) did not pan out			0
@entity137 , @entity138 ( @entity9 ) @entity137 built an oil empire in the early 1970s , striking gas in the first thirteen wells he drilled			1
his father had given him a head start ; @entity144 sold the @entity145 for millions			2
an undersized guard , @entity137 was captain of the 1965 @entity148 - winning @entity147			0
@entity150 coach @entity149 was a teammate , and @entity41 's successor , @entity151 , was a @entity147 assistant			2
@entity137 bought the @entity138 for an estimated $ 140 million in 1989			0
he immediately made waves by firing @entity153 -- the only coach in @entity138 history -- and replacing him with his college buddy ( the aforementioned @entity149 , who was coaching the @entity156 )			0
after a rocky 1 - 15 start in 1989 , the @entity138 went on to win three @entity94 in the 1990s			1
@entity0 : a brief history of stadium naming rights 6			0
@entity161 , @entity162 ( @entity9 ) , @entity164 ( @entity163 ) @entity161 inherited a small jewelry repair business from his father			1

@entity161 made five previous attempts to join the elite ranks of @entity9 ownership , including a failed 1993 bid to bring an expansion team to @entity192			1
the @entity193 said @entity161 had " a reputation as a franchise window shopper , one who looks at virtually every team that comes up for sale			1
" but in 1995 , he outbid @entity199 for the downtrodden @entity162			0
under his leadership , the franchise was righted , earning a @entity94 title in 2003			1
@entity161 also bought @entity164 , and fans were n't exactly pleased			1
@entity204 , @entity205 ( @entity23 ) , @entity206 ( @entity207 ) , @entity208 ( @entity9 -- partial owner ) @entity204 is a self - made man who also married mega-rich			1
