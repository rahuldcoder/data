@entity0 -- as soon as 36 - year @entity4 veteran @entity3 finished his concession speech tuesday , he walked off the stage , out the back door and into his car			1
but he left behind something unusual and -- in the annals of politics -- somewhat extraordinary			0
@entity3 had his aides distribute a prepared statement that was part detailed defense of his ill - fated and often maligned campaign strategy , and part stark warning to both parties about the divisive state of @entity20 politics -- starting with @entity21 , the @entity22 who beat him			1
" his embrace of an unrelenting partisan mindset is irreconcilable with my philosophy of governance and my experience of what brings results for @entity32 in the @entity4			0
in effect , what he has promised in this campaign is reflexive votes for a rejectionist orthodoxy and rigid opposition to the actions and proposals of the other party , " @entity3 wrote of @entity21 , @entity44 's statement @entity21 appealed to @entity22 voters by arguing @entity3 's tolerance for compromise should be replaced by stand - your - ground confrontation			1
" he has pledged his support to groups whose prime mission is to cleanse the @entity22 party of those who stray from orthodoxy as they see it , " said @entity3 of the @entity22 opponent who beat him			1
" this is not conducive to problem solving and governance			1
and he will find that unless he modifies his approach , he will achieve little as a legislator			2
worse , he will help delay solutions that are totally beyond the capacity of partisan majorities to achieve , " said @entity3			1
@entity3 , a senior @entity22 statesman who briefed president @entity67 as a young naval officer , offered a shot across the bow to today 's @entity22			1
he said if @entity22 continue to make it difficult for legislators to find compromise , " we will be relegated to minority status			0
parties do n't succeed for long if they stop appealing to voters who may disagree with them on some issues			0
" and he did n't stop there			0
his stinging words about today 's divisive politics were reminiscent of moderate @entity84 senator @entity84 's open disgust for what the process has become when she announced she was retiring			0
" i do n't remember a time when so many topics have become politically unmentionable in one party or the other			0
republicans can not admit to any nuance in policy on climate change			0
@entity22 members are now expected to take pledges against any tax increases			0
for two consecutive presidential nomination cycles , @entity22 candidates competed with one another to express the most strident anti-immigration view , even at the risk of alienating a huge voting bloc , " said @entity3			2
the six - term @entity22 was hammered by @entity21 and outside groups for voting for president @entity107 's two @entity106 picks and supporting other parts of the president 's agenda from immigration to energy			1
@entity3 cast some votes and took positions - like defending earmarks - that he knew would be unpopular with the @entity22 base and could even lead to a primary defeat			1
many @entity22 strategists -- including close allies and longtime supporters -- were perplexed that he did n't tack right and alter his rhetoric in order to better position himself			0
in his unusual departing treatise , @entity3 said he believes his votes for @entity126 and auto industry bailouts , and immigration reforms were " the right votes for the country			1
" " i stand by them without regrets , " said @entity3			1
" ideology can not be a substitute for a determination to think for yourself , for a willingness to study an issue objectively , and for the fortitude to sometimes disagree with your party or even your constituents , " he said			0
earlier in the day , sen. @entity140 , @entity141 , a @entity3 supporter who avoided his own @entity4 primary defeat two years ago with scorched earth strategy against his opponent , told @entity1 he believes a lesson from a @entity3 loss is not to play defense			1
@entity140 was saying out loud what many @entity22 strategists had said in private : that @entity3 allowed opponents to define him and did not adequately prepare a re-election campaign in today 's anti-incumbent environment			1
@entity3 tried to dispel that			2
" the truth is that the headwinds in this race were abundantly apparent long before @entity21 announced his candidacy			2
one does not highlight such headwinds publicly when one is waging a campaign			0
but i knew that i would face an extremely strong anti-incumbent mood following a recession , " said @entity3			2
to people who whispered loudly that @entity3 simply did n't work hard enough to get back to @entity166 and prove he has n't lost touch , he insisted that " there never was a moment when my campaign took anything for granted			2
" with so many of @entity3 's moderate colleagues in both parties deciding to call it quits this year rather than face bruising re-election campaigns , it has been perplexing why the octogenarian did n't choose to cap off a stellar career by retiring on his own terms			1
he had a carefully - crafted answer for that too , saying his goals on domestic and foreign policy " would benefit from my continued service as a senator			0
" " these goals were worth the risk of an electoral defeat and the costs of a hard campaign , " he said			0
in the end , @entity3 did this the way he wanted -- the way so many of his former aides and supporters say he has always done things : his way			2
not always politically expedient or strategically smart , but , from his perspective , principled .			0

@entity3 delivers a statement that is part defense and part warning
@entity21 's stand - your - ground approach is not conducive to problem - solving , @entity3 says
he says he stands by his votes " without regrets "
