the foursome of chirpy college students warmed up in the @entity3 course tee box , focusing on loosening their legs before taking their first shot on a par - four hole			2
@entity8 ran toward his ball , almost " @entity11 " style			2
then there was that unmistakable " thump " and a well - struck soccer ball arced toward the first green and its 21 - inch diameter hole			1
welcome to the wonderful world of @entity19 , a soccer - golf hybrid played on more than 257 courses in the @entity21 , according to the @entity22			1
how @entity19 got started " it 's the same structure as golf , except you are playing with your feet , " said player @entity23 , wearing soccer cleats and baggy shorts			1
" you still have to include strategy			0
what kind of green are you playing on ? are you going to drive ? are you going to chip ? " he said			0
because soccer balls do n't travel as far as golf balls , the @entity19 holes are shorter , averaging 157 yards on the @entity39 , @entity40 , course			1
while the weekday , 18 - hole green fee for traditional golf at @entity3 is $ 38 , the fee for its ball - booting cousin is much less			1
the @entity19 green fee at @entity3 is $ 10 for adults and $ 5 for children			2
a soccer ball runs between $ 15 and $ 30 , and no tees or gloves are needed			1
" it 's really not expensive -- great when you are on the college budget , " @entity52 said while juggling his soccer ball between shots			1
" it 's a great way to spend 2Â½ hours with your friends			0
" at @entity3 , the @entity19 holes run perpendicular to and weave between regular golf holes , so both traditional and @entity62 play at the same time			1
@entity63 , a traditional golfer in pants and collared shirt , said the @entity66 can be a bit of a problem when unsupervised			0
" some are rolling around the sand traps , doing cartwheels , whatever they want , " @entity63 said			0
@entity73 @entity72 jumped up and clicked his heels like a merry leprechaun after kicking in a shot from the sand trap to make birdie			0
" chipping out ( of sand ) you are not allowed a walk - up approach , " @entity72 explained			2
" you just take one step and knock it out			0
" when word came that @entity19 might soon invade the @entity3 golf course , @entity83 , the head professional , was uncomfortable			1
" i thought it was a really crazy idea , " @entity83 said			0
" traditional golfers have had a hard time accepting this new course on their golf course			2
but it 's kind of like when the skiers had to take on the snowboarders			0
" the @entity66 represent a toehold on a new revenue opportunity in the shrinking golf business			1
there has been a net reduction of 643 golf courses in the @entity21 since 2006 because of closures , according to the @entity101			1
three reasons golf is on the decline @entity3 said that in peak summer playing months , traditional golfers accounted for an average of almost 10,000 rounds of golf and @entity62 averaged almost 900 rounds			2
" at first , a lot of other golf courses , i 'd hear them kind of teasing me about having @entity19 , " @entity83 said			1
" now they are all asking me about it			0
how do they get it ? it 's growing like wildfire			0
" it 's an inferno with its own rules and regulations , laws and language			0
as @entity8 's crushed first - tee shot landed and headed toward what he called the " sidewalk , " he held his head and grunted			2
" you mean cart path , " his fellow players corrected			0
the soccer ball rolled on the pavement hopelessly away from the hole , dooming @entity8 to a double bogie			1
that 's two over par , an agonizing score to both the club swingers and the new era kickers at @entity3 .			0

@entity19 , a soccer - golf hybrid , is being played on *hundreds* of courses across the @entity21
it is like golf , except you use your feet and a soccer ball
@entity19 could bring new revenue to courses as the golf business declines
