-- " the @entity1 are n't coming ! the @entity1 are n't coming ! " screams the headline of @entity4 's @entity3 , describing @entity1 as " normally reliable " but now a surprising let - down for @entity7 president @entity6			1
following a lengthy debate in the @entity1 parliament thursday , a majority voted against the government 's motion to militarily intervene in @entity13 in response to an alleged chemical attack by the @entity17 regime			1
the result of the emergency meeting has been described in the press as a humiliating defeat for both @entity1 prime minister @entity22 and @entity6			1
the @entity23 says @entity22 's intentions were hasty and the result of the vote was a " blow " to the @entity7 president			1
" like nearly all presidents since the @entity32 , he has relied on @entity1 to be shoulder - to - shoulder with @entity33 in any serious military or security engagement , " it said			2
writing for @entity38 's @entity37 , author @entity36 criticizes @entity7 president @entity6 's approach as slow and indecisive			1
" @entity13 's government can only feel fortunate that so grievous a violation of international norms has provoked so uncertain and disjointed a response , " she concludes			1
@entity44 reports @entity1 finance minister @entity46 's view that the result will diminish @entity1 's position in the world and fray the bond it has with the @entity7 @entity53 's weekly newspaper the @entity52 says the debate is " a stunning defeat " for @entity22			1
they also add that the @entity57 has said thursday 's @entity59 permanent member meeting , which failed to reach a conclusion , was another effort by @entity53 to not hold the @entity13 regime accountable for the use of chemical weapons			2
@entity53 's @entity66 - speaking daily , @entity65 , says there are eight issues that must be considered before carrying out an attack on @entity13			2
it says the main point is that @entity73 leaders are not thinking about the bigger picture , such as whether military intervention will actually prevent further use of chemical weapons			1
the paper also suggests pushing for diplomatic instead of military resolutions			0
the @entity81 's political editor @entity80 writes : " the prime minister has lost control of his own foreign and defence policy and as a result he will cut a diminished figure on the international stage			0
" he adds that the prime minister 's defeat will be mostly felt within his own party			0
@entity1 's daily newspaper @entity92 said @entity22 's military plans were " shot down in a dramatic commons vote " and that " foreign policy is in disarray			1
" it adds that the prime minister 's " humiliating defeat " questions his leadership			0
the paper also claimed the loss was a win for opposition leader @entity104 , who supported military intervention but then spoke firmly against it			1
according to the paper , some @entity108 ministers were quite confused			0
in the @entity1 political television program @entity111 , defence secretary @entity110 twice referred to the need to deter " @entity115 " from chemical warfare			0
@entity1 tabloid newspaper @entity116 also claims that @entity1 politicians can not pin @entity118 on a map			0
" one person picked @entity122 - hopefully they were joking , " quips the paper			0
@entity1 's @entity125 newspaper suggests @entity22 has shot himself in the foot , describing him as the " @entity130 " attempting to march his men to the top of the hill			2
" he now discovers that he has charged up his own hill while the majority of the @entity1 people and indeed a majority of their mps remain stubbornly at the bottom			0
" @entity137 reminds readers in its blog that the @entity1 government 's desire to take action in @entity13 is nothing new , including numerous warnings to @entity13 president @entity17 to stop attacks on his own people			1
@entity148 news outlet @entity148 24 expresses shock at the result of the vote , claiming that the nation 's president @entity152 will maintain his firm stance in support of military intervention			1
unlike in the @entity1 , the @entity148 leader does not need a vote in parliament to back his actions			2
@entity152 is also quoted as saying that @entity1 's agreement is not needed : " each country is sovereign to participate or not in an operation			2
that is valid for @entity1 as it is for @entity148			0
" the @entity165 in @entity166 reflects on the @entity167 -- the memory of which clouded the debate in parliament and gave rise to concerns from politicians who remember the invasion only too vividly , it says			0
however , unlike the uncertain grounds of that war , the paper points to the strong evidence of the use of chemical weapons			0
" unlike @entity183 in 2003 , the triggering event in @entity13 a decade later is not a shaky argument that the government possesses weapons of mass destruction , but a rocket assault that left hundreds of victims convulsing and gasping for breath , glassy - eyed and foaming at the mouth -- all classic symptoms of a reaction to poison gas			0
" however , some feel excluded from the debate altogether			0
the online version of the @entity199 @entity198 claims that @entity199 should have been a part of the discussion : " during the lengthy debate in the @entity1 parliament over a possible military intervention in @entity13 on thursday , @entity199 barely featured			1

@entity1 members of parliament voted against military intervention in @entity13
the decision goes against the government 's motion and @entity7 president @entity6 's intentions
