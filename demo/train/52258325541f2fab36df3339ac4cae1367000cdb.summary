there were three of them , one of them probably a child , and at least one met a gruesome end at the hands of a terrifying predator			2
about 67 million years later , a @entity9 rancher led scientists to their remains			1
now experts are digging out one of the most complete skeletons yet of a @entity15 , the three - horned , plant - eating dinosaur that was one of the last of the giant reptiles			1
" there 's only three other skeletons that will match the completeness of one of the specimens we 're excavating right now , " said paleontologist @entity19 , president of the @entity20			0
most of the remains found before now have included fewer than half of the prehistoric creatures ' bones , @entity19 said monday			1
the most complete to date , now on display at the @entity33 in @entity34 , has about 76 % of its skeleton			1
" the largest , more mature individual appears to be the most complete , " @entity19 said			2
" one is just a bit smaller , and there 's another one that by live weight is probably only half the size			0
" will mammoths be brought back to life ? liquid blood fuels cloning hopes the dig is going on near @entity48 , @entity9 , more than 200 miles north of @entity49			0
" the fact that there are three of them together is really cool , " @entity19 said			0
the trio could be male and female and their young , or they could be two females looking after a juvenile dinosaur , he said			1
and before now , there was no indication that the @entity15 moved in groups			1
the @entity20 is working with the @entity59 , from the @entity60 , on the dig. @entity19 called the discovery of a young @entity15 a " very significant " find as well , since it will give scientists an insight into how the great lizards grew up			1
newly discovered dinosaur fossil is a primitive bird triceratops lived in the twilight of the @entity70 , about a half a million years before the dinosaurs ' extinction			2
much of what is now the @entity75 and southern @entity76 was once part of a vast inland sea , and the region is rich in fossils			0
" like most of the specimens that were found , it was brought to our attention by a rancher , " @entity19 said			1
the rancher sent photos to the @entity20 , located in neighboring @entity87 , in late 2012			2
excavation began in may and is expected to take about a month			0
so far , the bones that have turned up point to a violent end , probably at the hands of the feared @entity93			1
on the largest of the three specimens , at least two of the major limb bones were " bitten through , " @entity19 said			0
" if you can imagine , this is a bone that is nearly four feet long , " he said			0
but a @entity93 " would kind of chop the carcass up with their giant , shearing jaws , " ripping through flesh and bone alike			1
" i think we also have a feeding site for @entity93 , which is very exciting , " he said			2
" this is potentially a site where we can learn the behavior of two different species			0

a rancher led scientists to the remains of three @entity15
one of the three may be the most complete skeleton yet found
a young dinosaur is among the trio
at least one may have been *killed* by a @entity93
