it 's well known that the decision to impose collective guilt on @entity3 at the end of the @entity5 was a fateful one			1
but even today , 100 years after the start of the @entity5 , the fallout from the @entity8 affects @entity11 foreign policy -- from @entity12 to the @entity13 , from @entity14 to @entity15			1
at the @entity17 , the signing of the @entity8 ended the state of war between @entity3 and the @entity19			1
@entity20 of the treaty , the notorious @entity20 , required " @entity3 ( to ) accept the responsibility of @entity3 and her allies for causing all the loss and damage " during the war			1
the treaty forced @entity3 to disarm , make substantial territorial concessions and pay reparations to certain countries			2
the total cost was 132 billion marks , or $ 31.4 billion , roughly equivalent to $ 442 billion today			2
at the time , economists , notably @entity35 , warned that the victors were imposing a brutal " @entity46 peace , " a reference to the peace imposed on @entity39 by @entity40 2,000 years before , which amounted to a complete crushing of the enemy and which also mandated the payment of constant tribute			0
opinion : how a century - old war affects you @entity3 ' feelings of victimization and hatred of @entity8 were soon exploited by @entity53			1
many analysts now conclude that this miscarriage of justice , this experience of collective punishment , backfired and helped pave the road to @entity60 the discrediting of the collective guilt imposed at @entity8 would result in a major reorientation in international law and policy , changes that we live with today			1
guilty nations have been replaced by war criminals , prosecuted and punished by international tribunals			2
after @entity60 , the @entity70 for " crimes against the peace " were justified not in retrospective terms but in forward - looking ones -- namely the peace of future generations			2
the postwar trials reflect that even individual responsibility is understood today less in terms of retribution than deterrence			0
opinion : when chemical weapons killed 90,000 this new view of responsibility has become more and more pronounced in recent years , to the point where individuals may be held responsible , but nations are absolved			2
in 1995 , at the first public indictment proceeding of the architects of the @entity93 ethnic cleansing policy , chief prosecutor @entity89 declared that the proceeding of the @entity95 for the former @entity96 would establish a " public record " to " assist in attributing guilt to individuals ... and in avoiding the attribution of collective guilt to any nation or ethnic group			1
" opinion : the mighty women of @entity5 in the words of the prosecutor in the very first case in the court against a member of the @entity118 paramilitary force , @entity119 , accused of horrendous persecution of @entity121 in the @entity123 detention camp , " absolving nations of collective guilt through the attribution of individual responsibility is an essential means of countering the misinformation and indoctrination which breeds ethnic and religious hatred			1
" ( @entity119 was convicted of , among other things , crimes against humanity			0
) such international justice via individual accountability would break " old cycles of ethnic retribution " and thus by displacing vengeance would advance reconciliation			0
the court was considered to be critical to restoring the peace in the region			0
opinion : how @entity5 gave us ' cooties ' this emphasis on individual responsibility was crowned with the establishment of the permanent @entity142 in 2000			2
deterrence is the clear goal in the @entity142 preamble			0
it declares that " during this century millions of children , women and men have been victims of unimaginable atrocities that deeply shock the conscience of humanity , " and expresses the @entity142 's determination to " put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of these crimes and thus to contribute to the prevention of such crimes			0
" the @entity161 also shifted away from collective punishment toward smart sanctions that target individuals with economic and other punitive measures , ordered by the @entity166 , and not entire countries			1
indeed , one can see how this shift affects policy today toward @entity170 over its meddling in @entity14 and toward @entity15 , where in both instances international response has taken the form of international sanctions as well as international criminal justice , both responses eschewing collective punishment			1
opinion : the ' bionic men ' of @entity5 in @entity15 , for example : this may the @entity182 sponsored a resolution to @entity166 members that would have given the @entity142 jurisdiction over crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in @entity15 during its ongoing civil war			1
the @entity11 was among the many @entity166 members to support the referral , but the action would ultimately be blocked by @entity194 and @entity170 in a @entity166 vote earlier this summer			0
likewise , the @entity170 incursion into @entity198 might in the past have raised @entity200 tensions and provoked a collective punishment on the entire nation , but the response of the @entity11 and the @entity204 illustrates the approach of individualizing responsibility : while the sanctions have been progressively expanded and tightened in response to ongoing events ( the latest being the downing of the @entity214 jet over @entity14 ) , the companies and individuals targeted have been clearly selected on the basis of their proximity -- those who may be making or supporting the specific decisions relating to @entity14			1
still , such sanctions can only work if the international community hangs together , and the temptation for the world 's major military powers to revert to the rhetoric of retribution can be almost overwhelmingâ € ” one might say even that the @entity227 administration fell victim to it late last year calling for accountability and an end to impunity for the @entity234 regime as a basis for @entity11 military intervention			0
but the anniversary of the @entity5 and its @entity238 can serve as a reminder that retribution against a people or society breeds a sense of injustice and indeed may be intrinsically unfair			0
rather than a just settlement to war , it may serve only to perpetuate conflict			0

@entity253 : @entity8 that ended @entity5 *hostilities* imposed huge cost on @entity3
this assigning of " collective guilt " likely helped @entity53 exploit @entity3 *humiliation* , *foment* @entity60
@entity261 : backfire changed how global community punishes war crimes : individuals , not nations
@entity261 : today age of " smart sanctions , " global tribunals , such as in response to @entity170 , @entity15
