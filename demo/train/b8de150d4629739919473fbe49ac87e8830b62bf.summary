on his way home from a trip to @entity5 , marriage equality advocate @entity0 discovered another way to fight for his rights			0
@entity0 and husband @entity8 stepped up to the @entity10 ticket counter in @entity11 , @entity5 , expecting to undergo a preflight security screening together , just like heterosexual married couples			1
that did n't happen , even though the @entity15 struck down part of the @entity17 in late june , allowing for some federal recognition of same - sex marriage rights			2
the @entity22 's rules had not been updated when the couple flew home from @entity5 on january 18 , a story first reported in the @entity25			1
with the exception of husbands and wives , and parents and their children younger than 13 , airlines flying into the @entity27 from certain countries have to screen travelers individually under @entity22 rules			1
that appears to be changing			2
the @entity22 is updating its language , an agency spokesman confirmed thursday			1
because they were not a heterosexual married couple , @entity10 agents refused to screen @entity8 and @entity0 together before issuing their boarding passes , @entity0 said			1
one rudely ordered @entity8 back in line , @entity0 said			0
" we knew this had happened to another couple but did n't believe it could happen to us , " said @entity0 , a partner at the @entity45 law office of @entity46			2
@entity10 confirmed the two men were screened separately			0
employees were following @entity22 security rules , said @entity54 , president of @entity55 , who consults with @entity27 on @entity57 issues			1
within hours of the incident , the couple took to @entity60 and @entity61 to report the incident			0
@entity0 also contacted the @entity64 @entity57 liaison and two members of @entity66 to ask the @entity22 to update its airline screening questions			1
" @entity22 is working to make clear any confusion in language included in the @entity73 document , " wrote a @entity22 spokesman , via e-mail			2
" @entity22 policy is for every attempt to be made to accommodate all families traveling together			2
" the agency declined to discuss any more specifics of its security procedures			0
" i 'm thrilled how quickly people decided this is wrong , " said @entity0			0
" it 's a sign of the times that @entity27 executives at the corporate level wanted to stamp this out fast			2
" the change appears to be immediate at @entity10 , @entity0 said , citing an e-mail he received from an airline lawyer : " @entity22 has communicated to our corporate security folks that they are working on a technical change to its directive , and that , pending that change , we can immediately begin screening same - sex spouses together			1
we are working on communicating this change in procedures to our stations asap			0
" @entity27 is happy to implement the @entity22 change , said @entity54			1
" for two decades , @entity10 has been a leader in @entity57 equality , and now with @entity17 's repeal , outdated rules that treat married couples differently can come tumbling down , " said @entity54			1
" a seemingly small but crucial equality milestone for all travelers			0
" it wo n't be too long before @entity0 and @entity8 will test the change			0
they have a second home in @entity5 , and they 're flying back in march for a wedding			0
" i expect us to be treated like every other legally married couple , " said @entity0			1
" when they ask , ' why are you together ? ' i will say , ' we 're legally married			0
' we expect them to give us our boarding passes , and we 'll move on			0

*gay* couple did n't expect to be separated for airline security screening
heterosexual married couples can answer the preflight questions together
@entity22 says it is changing its *guidance* for airlines flying into the @entity27
