-- @entity2 's parliamentary elections kick off sunday , with polls suggesting the center - left -- led by @entity5 -- is on track to defeat controversial three - time prime minister @entity7			1
but @entity7 's rise in the polls in recent weeks , combined with widespread public disillusionment , means that nothing about the race is a foregone conclusion			1
who are the candidates ? the two - day election is a four - horse race between political coalitions led by @entity5 , @entity7 , outgoing premier @entity19 , and the anti-establishment movement led by ex-comedian @entity21			1
polls are banned within two weeks of the elections , but the most recent ones had @entity5 holding onto a slender lead over @entity7			1
@entity21 was a distant third			0
@entity2 's political system encourages the forming of alliances			0
for example , the @entity29 has teamed with the more left - wing @entity31			0
the center - left alliance is dominated by the @entity29 , led by @entity5			1
the 61 - year - old @entity5 comes across as " bluff and homespun , and that 's part of his appeal -- or not , depending on your point of view , " said political analyst @entity40 , department chair of international relations at the @entity43			2
he described @entity5 , a former communist , as a " revised apparatchik , " saying the reform - minded socialist was paradoxically " far more of a free marketeer than even people on the right			2
" at second place in the polls is the center - right alliance led by @entity7 's @entity53 , in coalition with the right - wing , anti-immigration @entity55			1
@entity7 has given conflicting signals as to whether he is running for the premiership , indicating that he would seek the job if his coalition won , but contradicting that on other occasions			0
the septuagenarian playboy billionaire nicknamed " @entity7 " has been campaigning as a @entity64 court weighs his appeal against a tax fraud conviction , for which he was sentenced to four years in jail last year			0
the verdict will be delivered after the elections ; however , under the @entity2 legal system , he is entitled to a further appeal in a higher court			0
because the case dates to july 2006 , the statute of limitations will expire this year , meaning there is a good chance none of the defendants will serve any prison time			0
why are elections taking place now ? @entity2 parliamentarians are elected for five - year terms , with the current one due to end in april			0
but in december , @entity7 's @entity84 ( @entity53 ) withdrew its support from the reformist government led by @entity19 , saying it was pursuing policies that " were too @entity88 - centric			1
" @entity19 subsequently resigned , and the parliament was dissolved .			2

@entity5 's center - left alliance leads @entity7 's center - right alliance in polls
but @entity7 's recent *improvement* could make for a *tightly* *contested* race
elections are early because the *ex-prime* minister resigned and parliament dissolved
