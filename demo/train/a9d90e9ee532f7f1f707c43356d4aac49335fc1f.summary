-- the 86th @entity1 are in the record books			1
here are five things that struck us about sunday 's broadcast : 1			2
history for " 12 years a slave			0
" the subject matter -- the chronicle of a slave in 19th - century @entity11 -- was challenging , to say the least , more the stuff of educational documentaries than major motion pictures			2
moreover , " @entity18 " did not turn away from the brutality noted in @entity17 's memoir			1
it lacked a major star ( except perhaps @entity21 in a small role ) , was made by a black @entity24 director and starred a black @entity24 actor			2
but the searing film was rewarded with three @entity1 sunday night -- including the big prize , best picture			1
" this is for all the people who have endured slavery , and the 21 million people who still endure slavery today , " director @entity32 said in his acceptance speech			2
the most tweeted photo ever			0
@entity37 , move aside -- you 're now second to @entity39			1
during sunday 's show , the comedian and @entity1 host went into the audience to shoot a selfie featuring some of her famous friends			1
the resulting picture included @entity39 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity21 , @entity51 , @entity52 and her brother @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity57 's eye			1
( @entity55 took the picture			0
) the 2012 photo of @entity37 and @entity60 was retweeted more than 778,000 times			0
the @entity1 picture had exceeded 2 million before 1 a.m. et monday -- and put a strain on the social media service for a short time			1
the motion picture academy apologized for the traffic jam -- though its apology was retweeted " only " about 4,000 times			0
@entity52 's " golden statue			1
" there were few memorable speeches at sunday 's awards , but newcomer @entity52 -- who won best supporting actress for " @entity18 " -- gave a standout			1
paying tribute to @entity78 , the enslaved woman she portrayed in the film , the 30 - year - old actress at times struggled to keep her composure			1
" it does n't escape me for one moment that so much joy in my life is because of so much pain in someone else 's , " she said			2
" when i look down at this golden statue , may it remind me and every little child : no matter where you come from , your dreams are valid			0
a big night for " gravity			2
" " gravity , " @entity96 's film about a space mission gone wrong , did n't win best picture , but it did the best by far of any nominated film , winning seven @entity1 altogether			1
though most were in technical categories , the film won a particularly sweet prize : best director for @entity96 , who spent four years putting his heart and soul into the technically demanding film , dazzling even the special - effects community			2
@entity96 is the first @entity110 to win best director			0
one wonders what he 'll do next			0
always restless , his films have included a story set on a dying @entity115 ( " @entity118 " ) , a @entity117 film ( " @entity119 " ) , a moving drama set in modern @entity121 ( " @entity122 " ) and an adaptation of a children 's classic ( " @entity125 " )			0
incidentally , there were two films with 10 nominations			0
" gravity " was one			0
the other ? " @entity130 , " which went 0 - for - 10			0
a tame and unsurprising show			0
for the most part , the @entity1 prognosticators were right : with the possible exception of @entity52 , who beat @entity47 for best supporting actress , all the winners were expected			1
perhaps more surprising was the overall flatness of the show , which felt as sluggish as its 3Â½ - hour running time			0
there were no spectacular song - and - dance numbers and few startling moments beyond @entity52 's speech and @entity145 's impromptu performance of the gospel song " @entity147			1
" even @entity39 was n't always sharp			2
her jokes were uneven , and some of her stunts -- notably an attempt to buy pizza for the audience -- did n't quite pay off			0
however , give the host credit : she 's got that record - setting selfie			1
as best actress winner @entity156 might say to all the complainers , " suck it			1
" the list of winners			0

despite *obstacles* , " @entity18 " takes @entity1 's big prize
@entity39 sets record for tweet with a star - *studded* selfie
