@entity0 -- two influential @entity3 senators said sunday they oppose any effort by @entity5 to cut funding for @entity8 participation in the @entity10 military mission			1
the comments by conservative sens. @entity12 of @entity13 and @entity14 of @entity15 came on the 90th day of the @entity10 campaign -- which @entity18 speaker @entity17 says is the deadline in the @entity20 for the @entity22 administration to get congressional authorization it has yet to seek			1
@entity17 , @entity25 , said last week that cutting funding for the mission was an option that the @entity3 - controlled @entity18 will consider when it takes up a defense appropriations bill this week			2
he contended that president @entity22 has failed to comply with the @entity20 , and that the main tool @entity32 has to respond is to control the spending			0
however , @entity12 and @entity14 told sunday talk shows such a move would send the wrong signal and undermine @entity38 allies leading the @entity10 mission with @entity8 support			1
" if we do not continue this effort in @entity10 , if ( @entity47 ) @entity46 remains in power , it could have profound consequences , " @entity12 said on the @entity42 program " @entity43			1
" @entity14 , appearing on @entity51 's " @entity50 , " adhered to longstanding conservative dogma by declaring that the @entity20 of 1973 , which limits the ability of the president to unilaterally engage @entity8 forces in combat , is unconstitutional			1
he also said the ouster of @entity46 , the @entity10 leader , was in the @entity8 national interest , because failure to do so would undermine the @entity8 standing in the world , cause oil prices to rise and send @entity10 refugees streaming across the border into an already fragile @entity65			1
" the president 's done a lousy job of communicating and managing our involvement in @entity10 , but i will be no part of an effort to de-fund @entity10 or to try to cut off our efforts to bring @entity46 down , " @entity14 said , later adding that @entity22 " needs to step up his game with @entity10 but @entity32 should sort of shut up and not empower @entity46			1
" outgoing defense secretary @entity76 also backed the @entity10 mission , saying @entity22 was right to limit the scope of @entity8 involvement and that he believes the president has complied with the @entity20			1
" what was going on in @entity10 was considered vital interest by some of our closest allies			0
those are the same allies that have come to our support and assistance in @entity91 , " @entity76 told @entity1 's " @entity92			0
" " and so it seems to me the kind of limited measured role that the president decided on , in support of our allies who did consider it a vital interest , is a legitimate way to look at this problem			0
" in a separate interview on " @entity105 , " @entity76 noted the war powers debate dates back several decades and administrations			0
" frankly , i think cutting off funding in the middle of a military operation when we have people engaged is always a mistake , " @entity76 said , later adding : " i believe that president @entity22 has complied with the law , consistent in a manner with virtually all of his predecessors			0
i do n't think he 's breaking any new ground here			0
" in a letter to @entity22 last week , @entity17 strongly disagreed , saying the president would be in violation of the @entity20 starting sunday for failing to secure congressional authorization			0
passed in 1973 , the @entity20 gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending @entity8 forces to war , followed by a 30 - day extension to end the hostilities			0
in response to @entity17 's letter , the @entity18 sent @entity32 a 32 - page report that asserted @entity22 did n't need congressional authorization because the @entity8 forces play only a supporting role in @entity10 and do n't engage in what the @entity20 defined as hostilities			1
" we 're obviously not changing our mission , " @entity18 press secretary @entity136 said friday , later adding : " what we have said is that our role in this mission , our support role and the kind of engagement we have right now , does not meet , in our legal analysis , ... the threshold set by the @entity20 for congressional action			0
" later friday , @entity17 said he specifically asked if the @entity149 's @entity148 agreed with the administration 's legal analysis , and that the @entity18 's failure to answer that question made cutting funds for the mission a possibility			1
" @entity158 will not allow the @entity18 to continue skirting its obligations to the @entity8 people , this @entity32 , and the laws of this nation , " @entity17 said in a statement			1
" over the coming week , our members will review all options available to hold the administration to account			0
" at the @entity149 , deputy spokesman @entity166 seemed to acknowledge that opinions differed over interpreting the mission 's compliance with the @entity20			0
" our views were heard , as were other views , and the president then made the decision as was appropriate for him to do , " @entity166 said			0
on the @entity42 program , @entity12 called for passage of a resolution he drafted with @entity178 sen. @entity177 of @entity179 that supports the @entity10 mission , which he said would serve as congressional authorization under the @entity20			1
@entity18 @entity3 are n't the only ones challenging the @entity10 mission			1
a bipartisan group of 10 @entity18 members has filed a federal lawsuit challenging @entity22 's power to commit @entity8 forces to the @entity10 mission			1
congressional opponents of the @entity10 mission include liberals such as rep. @entity192 of @entity193 , who generally oppose any war effort , as well as some republicans who complain its objective of civilian protection fails to match the stated @entity8 goal of @entity46 's ouster			1
the opponents also say the @entity10 situation could become a stalemate that drains resources at a time of mounting federal deficits that must be addressed			0
the @entity18 , however , says incremental progress is occurring through increasing diplomatic , political and military pressure on @entity46 to step down			0
@entity136 repeatedly emphasized this week that @entity22 had kept his word to the @entity8 people that the initial @entity8 leadership role in the mission would get reduced to a supporting role , and no @entity8 ground troops would take part			2
@entity136 suggested that @entity17 is playing politics with the issue , noting that he previously questioned the constitutionality of the @entity20 in a 1999 debate over former president @entity221 's push to take part in @entity38 bombing during the @entity224 conflict			2
@entity17 's complaints this week " stand in contrast to the views he expressed in 1999 , when he called the @entity228 act , quote , ' constitutionally suspect , ' unquote , and warned @entity32 to , quote , ' resist the temptation to take any action that would do further damage to the institution of the presidency , ' " @entity136 noted			1
@entity236 , a former @entity237 administration lawyer now with the @entity238 , also challenged @entity17 's position on the matter			2
in an op - ed published friday by the @entity242 , @entity236 -- known for bedrock conservative views -- wrote that @entity17 and other @entity3 opponents of the @entity10 mission are playing politics by arguing about the @entity20 instead of using their budgetary authority to cut funding for the @entity10 mission			1
" by accusing president @entity22 of violating the @entity20 , @entity18 @entity3 are abandoning their party 's long - standing position that the @entity253 allows the executive to use force abroad , subject to @entity32 's control over funding , " @entity236 wrote			2
" sadly , they 've fallen victim to the siren song of short - term political gain against a president who continues to stumble in national - security matters			0
" @entity236 called the lawsuit filed by seven @entity3 along with @entity192 and other @entity178 an " utterly futile " legal effort , adding that " the @entity265 has consistently turned away every case disputing the president 's decision to start wars abroad , and there is no reason to think it will change its ways now			0
" " lawsuits only distract attention from the real weapons that @entity32 has to get its way and hold a wayward president accountable , " @entity236 wrote , saying @entity5 instead could try to de-fund military operations or other spending programs , or refuse to lift the debt ceiling until @entity22 either halts @entity8 participation in the mission or gets congressional support			1
another option would be to launch an impeachment effort against @entity22 , @entity236 said , adding that " holding hands with isolationist @entity178 out of political convenience is no way to defend the @entity253			0
" even though the @entity289 in march unanimously passed a non-binding resolution supporting a no - fly zone over @entity10 , some @entity3 now express total opposition to the @entity8 support for that effort			2
" our policy in @entity10 is substantially flawed , " rep. @entity295 , @entity296 , said during last week 's debate of @entity3 presidential hopefuls			2
she cited a litany of complaints -- the supporting @entity8 role , a lack of vital national interest , unknown elements in the @entity10 opposition being helped -- and said @entity22 " was absolutely wrong in his decision on @entity10			1
" in its report on the mission , titled " @entity312 in @entity10 , " the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through june 3 was about $ 800 million			2
it estimated the total cost through september 30 would be $ 1.1 billion			0
" given the important @entity8 interests served by @entity8 military operations in @entity10 and the limited nature , scope and duration of the anticipated actions , the president had constitutional authority , as commander - in - chief and chief executive and pursuant to his foreign affairs powers , to address such limited military operations abroad , " the report said , adding : " the president is of the view that the current @entity8 military operations in @entity10 are consistent with the @entity20 and do not under that law require further congressional authorization , because @entity8 military operations are distinct from the kind of ' hostilities ' contemplated by the resolution 's 60 - day termination provision			1
" in response , @entity17 spokesman @entity340 called the @entity18 arguments " creative , " adding that @entity22 as commander - in - chief " has a responsibility to articulate how @entity8 military action is vital to our national security and consistent with @entity8 policy goals			2
" " with @entity10 , the president has fallen short on this obligation , " @entity340 said			2
