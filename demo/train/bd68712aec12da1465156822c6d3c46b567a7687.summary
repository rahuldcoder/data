they shall grow not old , as we that are left grow old : age shall not weary them , nor the years condemn			0
at the going down of the sun and in the morning we will remember them			0
( @entity7 1869 - 1943 ) nearly a century might have passed -- but the memory of one of the most famous football matches to have ever taken place remains as strong as ever			2
some 98 years have elapsed since @entity14 and @entity15 troops on the front line emerged from their trenches on that fateful @entity18 in 1914			1
while the @entity15 lined their trenches with decorations and sang carols , the @entity14 responded by running onto @entity21 with a ball at their feet and a " @entity18 truce " was born			1
the two sides , both enduring its first winter of combat , decided an impromptu football match would be one way to create some camaraderie			0
it is an event which is still fondly remembered today with the @entity36 's @entity35 bringing the story to the next generation			1
the present this weekend , teams from @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity15 and @entity42 will take part in a competition to honor those who fell in the @entity46			1
the tournament will see some of the best players under the age of 12 compete in the @entity51 town of @entity52 in @entity40 , one of the areas to be decimated by fighting and bloodshed			1
football made its own sacrifice to the @entity46 where more than 8,000 officers and men from the 17th and 23rd @entity60 perished at the @entity61 alone			1
the " @entity68 " as it was known , included players from a whole host of clubs ranging from @entity65 and @entity66 to @entity67 , now @entity67			0
read : black pioneer 's battle against racism @entity73 's @entity72 , the first black outfield player to star in the top flight and the first black infantry officer in the @entity76 , also lost his life			0
while such facts are hard to comprehend for most adults , these 12 - year - old children are given an insight into a time where evil plagued the earth and some 20 million lost their lives			2
the plan the @entity36 has two objectives for the project -- player development and education			1
" we got a fantastic reaction from the town of @entity52 and the teams that took part in the 2011 tournament , " said @entity91 , director of youth at the @entity36			1
" we are expressing our commitment to the competition by doubling it in size this year			0
" by the time of the 2014 commemorations we hope that the @entity104 will be recognized as an established cultural event			0
" the @entity35 brings education to life			0
our work in this area has already been highlighted by @entity110 when we got our ' @entity112 ' rating ; they recognized that @entity36 clubs encourage open minds that accept and welcome other cultures			1
read : a light through addiction 's ' dark days ' " an important job for the @entity120 is to help clubs develop more rounded young men			0
" we are using the @entity35 to not only foster the development of closer relationships between @entity126 clubs but develop greater understanding of the importance of shared histories			0
" this year , reigning champion @entity130 returns with @entity132 , while @entity133 and @entity134 represent @entity15			1
@entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 provide @entity40 representation with @entity139 flying the flag for @entity41			1
poignant for @entity132 , this tournament is rather poignant			2
@entity142 , a former player at the club , died at @entity52 and is commemorated on the @entity144 along with 57,000 @entity14 and @entity146 soldiers who were killed in the @entity147 of the @entity46			2
on friday night , @entity132 's players , including a child who attends the same school as @entity142 studied at , will lay a wreath at the @entity144 along with players from @entity130 , @entity132 , @entity135 and @entity136			2
that will be followed on the saturday by a dinner , which will be attended by dignitaries from the @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity52			0
and after the games have been played and the final whistle blown , perhaps these children will have learned a lesson -- and a story to tell their children one day in the future .			0
