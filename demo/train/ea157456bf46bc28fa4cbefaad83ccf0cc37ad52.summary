@entity0 -- from a few thousand people traveling by camel in the 7th century to three million a year today : the story of the @entity5 -- the @entity7 pilgrimage to @entity8 -- is an epic journey			1
that journey is celebrated in the first major exhibition dedicated to the @entity5 , opening at the @entity12 in @entity0 on january 26			1
it includes sacred objects , pictures and the human stories of pilgrims past and present			2
" we hope to be able to get across the hardship of the journey in the old days when it was a long journey by camel or by sea and could take two years there and back , " said @entity18 , the exhibition curator			2
" now of course you can go by plane			2
" yet despite the changes over the years , it was what had n't changed which most struck @entity34			2
" the experience itself does n't seem to have changed , " she said			0
" if you read the historical accounts of pilgrims in medieval times , their rituals , how they feel and the deep spiritual significance is the same as now			0
" the exhibition falls into three sections , the first focusing on the journey to @entity8 , particularly along the major routes used through history across @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and the @entity52			1
the second section focuses on the @entity5 today , its rituals and what the experience means to pilgrims			1
finally , the exhibition takes on @entity8 itself , its origins and importance			1
@entity8 is considered the spiritual center of @entity62 because it was where the @entity63 is said to have received his first revelations in the early 7th century			1
at its heart is the cube - shaped @entity68 , built by @entity70 and his son @entity71 , according to the @entity72			2
the @entity5 takes place in the last month of the @entity62 year , known as @entity74 and includes certain rituals which must be completed			1
every muslim who can is expected to go on @entity5 at least once in their lifetime			1
it took the @entity12 more than two years to collect all the objects , which include a seetanah which covers the door of the @entity68 , archaeological material , manuscripts , textiles , historic photographs and contemporary art. also on inside the @entity52 : finding freedom behind bars the exhibition was put together with the help of the @entity93 in @entity94 , which arranged the loan of some objects which had never before been taken outside @entity97			1
the @entity97 ambassador to @entity99 , hrh @entity98 , said : " @entity5 is not just a physical journey , it 's the most extraordinary spiritual journey every @entity7 takes			1
" we leave our families and our homes to undertake this profound life - changing experience			0
" it does n't guarantee passage to @entity109 , but it focuses us on what 's important in life			0
" it 's a sensitive issue for the @entity12 to tackle and we had long discussions to make sure it was accurate			2
eventually they did an excellent job			0
" @entity34 said : " the most challenging aspect for us was to turn it from a mere collection of objects into something evocative of the strong spiritual experience			0
" the way we did it was to include quotes and voices from pilgrims			0
" to accompany its exhibition , the @entity12 invited @entity7 to recount their own experiences on its website , and hundreds have done so			1
one , @entity137 , from @entity0 , wrote : " the moment you enter the @entity139 and first lay eyes on the @entity68 feels like the day you are truly born of life , your soul , heart and eyes soften and ease to the glorious sight			0
" also on inside the @entity52 : youth march ' shows true spirit ' another , @entity144 , from @entity145 , wrote : " hajj is the journey of pureness , love , hope and optimism			0
it taught me humility , patience and justice			0
" @entity156 , from @entity157 , @entity99 , wrote : " my most memorable moment was when i just happened to sit on some steps looking out to the @entity68			0
there were thousands of people from all over the world circumambulating this sacred structure at the center of the @entity165 , all there for a common purpose of praising @entity167 , yet each engaged in private reflection oblivious of any other			0
