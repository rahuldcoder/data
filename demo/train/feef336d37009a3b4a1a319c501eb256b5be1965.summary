-- waking to another cloudless morning , you dive off your houseboat into the wild blue of @entity4 in southern @entity5			1
the water takes the edge off the heat , and you float along , contemplating a lazy day of navigating spectacular red - rock gorges and flooded canyons			1
@entity12 , founder of @entity13 , says lakes have an inherent advantage over the ocean when it comes to vacations			1
" you 'll probably prefer the feel of freshwater over salt , and you probably wo n't miss seasickness , seaweed or sharks			1
you can choose your outdoor temperatures ; lakes exist at elevations from below sea level to 13,000 feet above			1
" see more of @entity30 's best lakes and temperature is n't your only choice : @entity30 offers a lake vacation for every season and activity , and no matter where you live , even in the @entity39 desert , chances are there 's one near you			1
satellite mapping has yet to yield a precise answer , but the best guess is that there are between 3 and 4 million lakes across the @entity30 , ranging from duck ponds to wonders like @entity49 's @entity48			1
while @entity51 is most popular for winter sports and @entity54 's @entity53 reaches its windsurfing peak in fall , we associate most lakes with summer , as places to cool off and chill out			1
a recent study by @entity60 named lake vacations the most popular summer travel trend of 2012 , ahead of beach vacations , romantic getaways , and family trips			2
so spend your @entity66 , or one of the few remaining warm weekends of the season , on the lake			2
@entity70 : weigh in on the @entity30 's @entity72 survey @entity73 : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity54 best for fishing : @entity73 is so vast it could easily hold all of the water from all of the other @entity79			1
that means there 's plenty of room for fish to thrive : salmon , trout , walleye , smelt , whitefish , herring , northern pike , smallmouth bass and many other game species can be caught in abundance along the lake 's tristate shores			1
no matter what time of year , some sort of fishing is in season ; @entity98 ( @entity75 ) and @entity99 ( @entity54 ) are among the charter hubs			2

@entity70 : best of the @entity104 lakes @entity48 : @entity49 best for scuba diving : other lakes have shipwrecks or sunken towns , but only @entity48 offers the bragging rights of diving in a flooded volcano that also happens to be the deepest lake in the @entity30 ( and ninth deepest in the world )			1
without a deep - sea submersible you wo n't be able to reach the absolute bottom ( 1,943 feet )			2
but there 's plenty to explore in the crystal - clear shallows : lava formations , wildlife ( trout and salmon ) , and underwater moss meadows			1
the catch is that you have to schlep your own scuba equipment up and down the @entity129 -- 700 vertical feet			1
if that 's not your idea of vacation , try the @entity135 boat cruises around the crater 's island on that clear , calm blue water			1

the annual @entity154 in september brings the nation 's top wind - sport racers to @entity53 to face gusts of up to 40 mph			1
in winter , the lake converts to sail - powered ice racing			2
