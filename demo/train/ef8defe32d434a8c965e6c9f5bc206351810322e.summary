editor 's note : @entity2 is the daughter of @entity3 and @entity4 , who both were governors of @entity6			1
she lives in @entity7 , @entity6 , with her husband , @entity8 , a retired state @entity10 justice			1
they have two sons , @entity14 , a decorated veteran of the @entity17 war , and @entity18 , a college sophomore			1
@entity2 says her father sought absolution for his segregationist views			1
@entity7 , @entity6 ( @entity22 ) -- i heard a car door slam behind me and turned to see an elderly but spry woman heading my way			2
the night before , a gang of vandals had swept through the cemetery desecrating graves , crushing headstones and stealing funereal objects			2
my parents ' graves , situated on a wind - swept hill overlooking the cemetery , had not been spared			2
a large marble urn that stood between two granite columns had been pried loose and spirited away , leaving faded silk flowers strewn on the ground			2
i was holding a bouquet of them in my arms when the woman walked up and gave me a crushing hug			2
" honey , " she said , " you do n't know me , but when i saw you standing up here on this hill , i knew that you must be one of the girls and i could n't help myself but to drive up here and let you know how much me and my whole family loved both of your parents			2
they were real special people			2
" i thanked her for her kind words as we stood side by side gazing down at the graves of @entity61			0
after a few moments , the woman leaned into me and spoke almost in a conspiratorial whisper			0
" i never thought i would live to see the day when a black would be running for president			0
i know your daddy must be rolling over in his grave			0
" not having the heart or the energy to respond , i gave her bony arm a slight squeeze , turned and walked away			0
as i put the remnants of the graveyard spray in the trunk of my car , i assumed that she had not bothered to notice the @entity81 sticker on my bumper			1
when i was a young voter and had little interest in politics , my father would mark my ballot for me			0
as i thought about the woman in the cemetery , i mused that if he were alive and i had made the same request for this election , there would be a substantial chance , though not a certainty , that he would put an " x " by @entity81 's name			1
perhaps it would be the last chapter in his search for inner peace that became so important to him after becoming a victim of hatred and violence himself when he was shot and gravely injured in a @entity106 , @entity107 , shopping center parking lot			0
perhaps it would be a way of reconciling in his own mind that what he once stood for did not prevent freedom of opportunity and self - advancement from coming full circle ; his final absolution			1
@entity3 and other @entity120 governors of his ilk stood defiantly in the 1950s and ' 60s in support of racial segregation , a culture of repression , violence and denial of basic human rights			1
their actions and the stark images of their consequences that spread across the world galvanized the nation and gave rise to a cry for an end to the @entity140 apartheid			1
the firestorms that were lit in @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity7 , @entity146 and @entity147 were a call to arms to which the people responded			0
and now a new call to arms has sounded as @entity153 face another assault on freedom			0
for if the stand in the schoolhouse door was a defining moment for @entity3 , then surely the aftermath of @entity157 and the invasion of @entity17 will be the same for @entity162			1
the trampling of individual freedoms and his blatant contempt for the rights of the average @entity140 may not have been as obvious as an ax - handle - wielding governor , but @entity162 's insidiousness and piety have made him much more dangerous			0
healing must come , hope will be our lodestar , humility will reshape the @entity140 conscience , and honesty in both word and deed will refresh and invigorate @entity153 , and having @entity81 to lead will give us back our power to heal			1
my father lived long enough to come to an understanding of the injustices borne by his deeds and the legacy of suffering that they left behind			0
history will teach future generations that he was a man who used his political power to promote a philosophy of exclusion			0
as his daughter , who witnessed his suffering in the twilight of his years and who witnessed his deeds and heard his words , i am one who believes that the man who , on march 7 , 1965 , listened to the reports of brutality as they streamed into the @entity200 from @entity147 , @entity6 , was not the same man who , in march of 1995 , was welcomed with open arms as he was rolled through a sea of @entity140 men , women and children who gathered with him to welcome another generation of marchers , retracing in honor and remembrance the historic steps from @entity147 to @entity7			1
four years ago , the young @entity213 senator who spoke at the @entity214 mesmerized me			0
i hoped even then that he would one day be my president			0
today , @entity81 is hope for a better tomorrow for all @entity153			1
he stands on the shoulders of all those people who have incessantly prayed for a day when " justice will run down like waters and righteousness as a mighty stream " ( @entity222 5:24 )			0
perhaps one day , my two sons and i will have the opportunity to meet @entity81 in person to express our gratitude to him for bringing our family full circle			1
and today , the day after the election , i am going to ride to the cemetery so that if asked , i can vouch for the fact that the world is still spinning but my father lies at peace			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : my dad , @entity3 , might have backed @entity81
@entity240 sought absolution for his earlier views , daughter says
she says @entity81 will help heal the nation after wounds of @entity157 and @entity17 war
