@entity0 , set to stand trial in the 2012 shooting death of teenager @entity3 , on tuesday waived his right to a " stand your ground " pretrial immunity hearing			1
@entity0 's attorneys have decided they will try this as a self - defense case			1
@entity12 's deadly force law , also called " stand your ground " , was passed in 2005			0
it allows people to meet " force with force " if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant			0
under the law , a person can use deadly force anywhere as long as he is not engaged in an unlawful activity , is being attacked in a place he has a right to be , and reasonably believes that his life and safety are in danger as a result of an overt act or perceived threat committed by someone else			0
in a pretrial immunity hearing , a judge would have ruled whether @entity0 's actions were protected under the " stand your ground " law ; a ruling in favor of the defendant would have meant that no criminal or civil trial could proceed			1
@entity3 was shot and killed on february 26 , 2012 , while returning from a nearby convenience store to his father 's fianc√©e 's house in a gated community in @entity50 , @entity12			2
@entity0 , a neighborhood watch captain , acknowledged that he shot the unarmed 17 - year - old , but said @entity3 physically attacked him and he fired in self - defense			1
initially , no charges were pursued , and the case soon became the center of a national controversy			0
@entity0 was charged with second - degree murder on april 11 , 2012			2
during tuesday 's motions hearing , @entity0 defense attorney @entity58 told judge @entity60 there was nothing in the law that required the immunity hearing to take place before @entity0 's trial			1
@entity58 said the hearing could be requested after the defense has presented its case , but " we 'd much rather have the jury address the issue of criminal liability or lack thereof			0
" @entity74 , attorney for the @entity3 family , said @entity0 's decision to " merge " the hearing and the trial " is very telling of his defense , or lack thereof			1
" " we believe the defense 's decision to waive a pretrial hearing and to merge the ' stand your ground ' hearing into the trial is to prevent putting @entity0 on the stand , " @entity74 said in a press release , " and to preclude the public and the potential jury pool from previewing the many inconsistencies in @entity0 's story			1
" @entity74 said a pretrial hearing was clearly the intent of state law because the statute " grants immunity from civil lawsuits , arrests and trials , if a defendant prevails			0
" @entity74 continued : " ... the decision made by the defense to waive a pretrial hearing and to solely continue on to trial vindicates the many thousands of protesters who demanded @entity0 be arrested for the killing of @entity3			2
after all , to have a felony criminal trial an arrest must first be made			0
" after the motions hearing ended , prosecutors and defense attorneys were to meet in private with the judge to discuss jury issues for the june 10 trial .			0

@entity0 waives his right to a " stand your ground " pretrial immunity hearing
@entity0 's attorneys have instead decided to argue self - defense
