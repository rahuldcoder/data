-- increased militarization in @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 has created more insecurity , especially for women , a report spearheaded by two @entity9 laureates found			1
" the war on drugs ... has become a war on women , " @entity10 laureates @entity11 and @entity12 wrote in the report , based on a 10 - day fact - finding mission			1
" efforts to improve ' security ' have only led to greater militarization , rampant corruption and abuse within police forces and an erosion of rule of law			1
" after consulting with presidents , high - ranking officials , human rights activists and others , the team compiled statistics to illustrate the problem			0
in @entity3 , for instance , the homicide rate for women has been increasing four times faster than that of men , said @entity39 , of the @entity40 in that country			1
the report says violence against women has become a crisis			2
@entity46 called it an epidemic			0
in the three countries studied , the respective governments are facing a national security threat from drug cartels			0
to wrest control from the encroaching drug cartels and to protect citizens , these countries have responded with a strong hand			0
most are familiar with @entity2 's case , in which nearly 50,000 have been killed in drug cartel - related violence since 2006			1
more recently , @entity4 president @entity61 was elected in part because of his promises of a strong response to the violence			1
the report argues that instead of providing safety , the additional troops and police on the streets are having the opposite effect : committing abuses and stirring up more violence			0
" increasing militarization and police repression under the guise of the war on drugs has led to more violence overall and more frequent attacks on women , who lead efforts to protect their communities against threats to their lands and natural resources , and protest military and police abuses , " the report states			1
a segment of the militarized approach , the report notes , comes from @entity91 aid			0
the report found that femicides increased by 257 % in @entity3 from 2002 to 2010 , a period that saw a doubling of @entity91 money for military and police			1
using the start of @entity2 president @entity99 's term as a benchmark , the report says femicides there rose 40 % since 2006			2
in @entity4 , 685 women were killed in 2010 , compared with 213 in 2000 , the report states			1
in that time , security aid to @entity4 increased threefold , the report found			1
in all , the team spoke with more than 200 female survivors who shared their stories			0
the authors say they found another disturbing pattern : most of the crimes against women in these countries are carried out with impunity			0
" the mounting crimes of extreme violence and targeted repression against women remain largely uninvestigated , unsolved and unpunished , due to fragile state institutions , deep flaws in the political and justice systems of these countries and a lack of political will to reform policies and institutions that implicitly condone them , " the report says			2
the authors highlighted the may 11 case of four civilians killed by @entity3 police on a helicopter who mistook them them for drug traffickers			2
two of the victims were pregnant women			0
the @entity139 was aiding the police , though the agency says it did so only in a supporting role			0
" i am horrified , but the truth is , this happens over and over again to women in the region , " @entity11 said			2
the report was a collaboration between the @entity147 .			0

@entity11 and @entity12 led fact - finding trip to @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4
violence against women has increased in all three , they say
it comes at a time of increased militarization against security concerns
