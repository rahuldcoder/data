@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 passengers face the prospect of holiday season chaos after cabin crew voted to strike for almost two weeks over @entity8 and @entity9 in protest over cost - cutting measures introduced by the airline			1
more than 12,500 @entity4 employees , balloted by trade union @entity15 in november , voted by a 92.5 percent majority to walk out from december 22 for 12 days , unite deputy general secretary @entity13 announced monday			1
in a statement to customers on its web site , @entity4 said it was reworking its flight schedules for the strike period and would announce them as quickly as possible			1
it said it would inform affected customers by e-mail or text message			0
the strike ballot came after the airline introduced cost - cutting measures including a two - year pay freeze and reducing the numbers of cabin crew members on long - haul flights			1
@entity4 says the changes , introduced in the wake of a record pre-tax loss of more than $ 485 million for the six months from april to september , will save the airline $ 665 million			2
@entity13 warned that the strike would inflict " catastrophic damage " to the airline if it went ahead and urged @entity4 bosses to return to the negotiating table			1
he said union members had been pushed into a corner by @entity4 chief executive @entity41			2
" we 've been saying to mr. @entity41 this seems crazy at a time when @entity4 is suffering badly through an economic downturn that he should force us into a dispute that would have catastrophic effects on the economy of the company , " @entity13 told @entity2 following a news conference at @entity43 , southern @entity1			1
" that 's why we 're hoping that even at this late hour the strength of feeling of our members will get through to the company			0
we are available 24 hours a day to meet the company			0
if they are up for getting an agreement i 'm confident we can get one			0
" @entity13 said passengers , upset at having their holiday plans disrupted , should take their anger out on the airline			2
@entity13 said his members were not " mindless militants " but decent men and women who had been forced into a corner by @entity72			0
but @entity73 said strike action was " completely unjustified " and called on union chiefs to resume negotiations			1
he said the airline had agreed pay cuts with pilots and more efficient ways of working with engineers , while a third of managers had taken voluntary redundancy			0
@entity4 cut 1,900 jobs over the summer through reduced overtime , increased part - time working , and voluntary redundancies			1
but it plans to eliminate 3,000 more jobs by march 2010 , @entity73 said last month			0
" my admiration for the professionalism and skills of @entity4 cabin crew is second to none			1
they are an absolutely vital part of our airline , and a great asset , " @entity73 said			0
" but they have been disgracefully misled by @entity15 as to how our company - wide cost reduction program would affect them			2
" @entity2 's @entity104 said the impact of the potential strike would be devastating for @entity4 and said the consequences would be disruption for @entity4 passengers and higher prices for travelers booking on other airlines			1
" their planes are heaving and they are now about to face a strike , " @entity104 said			0
" they are going to have tens of thousands of passengers who are concerned , who are worried			0
i imagine anyone who is going away for @entity8 is now thinking about shifting their booking if they can			0
" a spokesperson for @entity124 , which represents travel agencies and tour operators in the @entity127 , said passengers booked onto @entity4 flights should wait and see what contingency plans the airline puts in place and whether the strike goes ahead			1
" hopefully the strike could be called off and if you cancel your flight now then you may not be able to claim a refund , " she said			0
@entity15 has called on the @entity137 to rule on whether @entity4 's cutbacks have breached its member 's contracts but the case is not scheduled to be heard until february 2010 .			2
