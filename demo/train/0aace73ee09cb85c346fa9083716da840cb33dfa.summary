@entity0 -- despite having @entity5 agents on the ground and @entity9 leader @entity8 's exit as stated policy , @entity3 officials continue to say the @entity12 - led military mission in @entity9 is only for its authorized humanitarian purposes			1
the seeming discrepancy is part of a delicate diplomatic posture by the @entity18 administration on the complex overseas operation that involves a @entity21 resolution , a multinational military force and the symbolism of presidential statements and actions			0
with the military mission shifting thursday to a new phase of full @entity12 control after initial @entity3 leadership , divisions among alliance partners and within @entity28 became more evident , exacerbated by the administration 's differing military and political goals			1
president @entity18 continues to insist that arming the @entity9 rebels remained an option under consideration , while @entity12 secretary general @entity39 and @entity41 defense minister @entity40 ruled it out			1
at @entity44 and @entity45 committee hearings , @entity42 grilled defense secretary @entity46 and @entity48 chairman adm. @entity47 on the @entity3 role in @entity9			2
" to say this is not about regime change is crazy , " said @entity50 rep. @entity50 of @entity51			1
" of course this is about regime change			1
why not just be honest with the @entity3 people ? " @entity18 has said the motivation for launching military action on march 19 was to prevent a massacre of civilians by @entity9 military forces descending on the rebel stronghold of @entity62			2
since then , airstrikes carried out mostly with @entity3 planes and missiles have taken out much of @entity8 's anti-aircraft capability and destroyed ground forces and supply lines			2
while @entity8 's forces have pulled back from @entity62 , they reclaimed territory from the rebels in recent days , leading to fears of a prolonged stalemate without stronger military support for the rebels			2
on thursday , @entity44 spokesman @entity77 noted the @entity3 turned over control of the @entity9 mission to @entity12 that morning -- 12 days after it began -- to fulfill @entity18 's pledge to the nation that @entity3 leadership would end within " days , not weeks			1
" while @entity77 said the @entity3 and its allies would keep up pressure on @entity8 's government , he acknowledged that it was impossible to say when the mission would end			0
regardless of when , he said , " the scope of the @entity3 involvement will be limited " and @entity18 continues to reject any possibility of sending in @entity3 ground troops			0
at the same time , a former counterterrorism official confirmed the existence of a presidential finding that authorizes the @entity5 to conduct operations supporting @entity3 policy in @entity9			1
a presidential finding is a type of secret order authorizing some covert intelligence operations , and a former senior intelligence official said such operations could include " advising on how to target the adversary , how to use the weapons they have , reconnaissance and counter surveillance			0
" top administration officials distinguished between the military mission charged with protecting @entity9 civilians and the other non-military efforts -- including sanctions , freezing assets and @entity5 operations -- aimed at hastening @entity8 's departure			1
" does the @entity3 have the capacity to unilaterally with military force produce regime change in @entity9 or another country ? it probably does			1
we probably do , " @entity77 told reporters			0
" is that a desirable action to take when you have your eye on the long game here in terms of @entity9 's future , the future ... interests of the @entity3 and the region ? no. " @entity18 's dual - track policy , with the military coalition protecting @entity9 civilians while the @entity3 pursues " as a political , diplomatic and economic policy " the end of @entity8 's rule , is the best fit for the @entity9 situation , @entity77 insisted , citing the international backing for the military mission through a @entity21 resolution and @entity143 support			1
critics complained that it is both dishonest and a mistake for the military objective to differ from the policy objective			0
at a @entity153 hearing , rep. @entity149 , @entity151 - @entity150 , said the mission 's " military and political goals are not harmonized , " while @entity156 called it " just the most muddled definition of an operation probably in @entity3 military history			0
" on the @entity164 side , liberal rep. @entity161 of @entity162 challenged @entity18 's legal power to commit @entity3 forces to a combat role without congressional authorization			2
" this is a clear and arrogant violation of our @entity171 , " @entity161 declared on the @entity44 floor			0
" even a war launched ostensibly for humanitarian reasons is still a war and only @entity28 can declare a war			0
" sen. @entity177 of @entity178 , the unsuccessful @entity42 presidential nominee in 2008 , warned that pulling @entity3 forces back to a supporting role under @entity12 control undermined the military mission at a key moment			2
" for the @entity3 to be withdrawing our unique offensive capabilities at this time sends the exact wrong signal both to our coalition partners as well as to the @entity8 regime , especially to those @entity9 officials whom we are trying to compel to break with @entity8 , " @entity177 said at a @entity184 hearing			1
" i need not remind our witnesses that the purpose of using military force is to achieve policy goals , " @entity177 told @entity46 and @entity47			0
" but in this case , not only are our military means out of alignment with our desired end of @entity8 leaving power , we are now effectively stopping our strike missions all together without having accomplished our goal			0
" while @entity18 administration officials have described the continuing @entity3 role in the military mission as supportive -- involving refueling , intelligence , surveillance and communications -- @entity46 said thursday that @entity3 strike aircraft such as @entity211 and ac - 130s could still be made available to @entity12			2
however , he added that he believed @entity12 allies had the capacity to take out @entity9 ground forces as necessary under the mission 's mandate of protecting civilian populations			1
appearing before both the @entity44 and @entity45 panels at separate hearings , @entity46 said the no - fly zone had been established and now needed to be sustained , but acknowledged " you could have a situation in which you achieve the military goal but do not achieve the political goal			0
" @entity1 's @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 contributed to this story .			0
