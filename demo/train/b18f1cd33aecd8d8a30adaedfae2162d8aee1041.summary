-- recently , @entity2 chancellor @entity1 , who is @entity3 , was bombarded with harassing tweets when she decided not to cancel classes at the @entity2 campus during january 's severe weather			0
upset over the decision , some students attacked her with racial and gender slurs			1
the harsh hashtag -- # f --- phyllis -- reinforced notions that the sexual domination and objectification of women are still major problems in our society and on our campuses			1
would the students have engaged in attacks on gender and race had the chancellor been a white man ? somehow , i do n't think so			1
there was no respect for @entity29 's position , nor her credentials -- but her high - visibility job made her stand out			1
the duality of being hypervisible and simultaneously invisible is the latest identity quagmire that some highly accomplished women must navigate			1
they are hypervisible because they are often the only one of a few in their position -- thus , they stand out			1
yet because of their gender , and sometimes their race , their presence is not the norm , and others are not used to seeing them in these roles			0
those same women who worked hard to climb the ladder to success sometimes find that they are out of place and unwelcome , rendering them invisible in certain situations			1
it 's almost as if they 're saying , " i see you , but i do n't respect you and therefore i 'm not going to acknowledge you as a human being			2
" while women have moved into positions of power , they have not moved with ease			1
it 's perplexing , given women 's accomplishments over the decades , that it continues to happen 50 years after the 1964 @entity67 , which banned employment discrimination			2
but it is also not new			0
pioneering journalist @entity70 was threatened with murder after speaking out publicly in the 1890s			0
she became hypervisible after she criticized the lynching of black men			2
when whites ransacked her newspaper office with the intent to kill her , she only escaped the attempt on her life because she was out of town			0
today , powerful , public women are not usually threatened with murder			1
but their opinions are often discounted , disregarded and dismissed -- or they are personally attacked			1
# @entity84 : join the conversation on friday march 7 at 5pm et / 10pm gmt in my research on the experiences of black women television news managers , i discovered this same dichotomy			2
on the one hand , these executives are highly recruited for their production and management skills			0
on the other hand , a little more than one - third of the 40 women interviewed described feeling invisible in editorial meetings where their ideas were not always given full credit until they came from someone else , usually a white man			2
this rendering of women 's ideas and personhood as invisible has consequences			2
psychologist @entity106 calls these subtle and not - so - subtle snubs " microaggressions " and says they can lead to higher stress levels and more illness			0
as highly accomplished women move into spaces previously reserved for men , they might face more of these microagressions , which are often magnified in a social media , internet age			0
as college classrooms become increasingly female with more students of color , how can we teach that hard work and persistence will get them noticed , when the truth is , it might simultaneously render them invisible ? how do we stop the disrespect ? first , we must acknowledge it and say it 's wrong			0
silence is not an option			0
this is what @entity1 did when she wrote an essay addressing the hateful tweets			0
" what was most disturbing was witnessing social media drive a discussion quickly into the abyss of hateful comments and even threats of violence , " @entity29 wrote in @entity137 secondly , we must continuously teach that the disrespect of women online or in person will not be tolerated			1
the @entity2 example reminds us that if cyberharassment can happen to a woman as highly accomplished as @entity29 , all women are vulnerable			0
there is an urgent need to educate			0
lastly , we must continue to see ourselves as leaders , regardless of whether others are used to seeing us in that role			0
only when women in positions of power become the norm will they be able to fully exercise that power			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			1

a recent attack on a *university* leader shows how public women are personally attacked
@entity165 writes that women have n't made easy moves into power
@entity165 : women in power have a dual existence , hypervisible and often *unseen*
disrespect can be stopped by not remaining silent , @entity165 writes
