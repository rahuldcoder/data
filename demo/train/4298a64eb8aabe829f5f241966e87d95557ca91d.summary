-- a year after the @entity2 in @entity3 , the @entity1 is at a crossroads			1
many of the agency 's proposals to ensure such a calamity does n't happen here are good in principle , but their effectiveness will depend on how well they are executed and how quickly			2
it took 10 years for the agency to fully implement security upgrades made necessary by the 9/11 terrorist attacks , and it will take at least five years to institute changes in response to @entity2 , whose anniversary is march 11			2
in the meantime , the nuclear industry is getting out ahead of the @entity1 by launching a voluntary program that might not adequately protect the public			1
what are the implications of @entity2 for the @entity27 nuclear fleet ? immediately after the accident , some argued that @entity27 reactors are not as vulnerable			2
but it became clear that @entity3 reactors and those in the @entity27 are similar in many ways			0
for example , the @entity37 @entity36 reactors at @entity2 , like the 23 @entity36 reactors in the @entity27 , had hardened vents to release heat and relieve pressure from their containment buildings during an accident			2
but the vents wo n't work without electric power			0
the @entity2 and @entity27 reactors also lack control - room instruments that would monitor spent fuel pool water levels and temperature			1
and @entity27 plant owners ' plans for managing emergencies probably would not have worked any better than those at @entity2			2
last summer , an @entity1 task force reviewed the @entity2 accident and came up with a dozen recommendations to reduce @entity27 reactor vulnerability			1
the @entity1 agreed to implement some of the proposals in the near future , but relegated the task force 's top recommendation to the back burner			1
that top recommendation called for the @entity1 to clarify its " patchwork " regulatory framework for events that reactors are not intended to withstand , such as the earthquake - tsunami combination that overwhelmed @entity2 -- an event termed " beyond - design - basis			1
" it would make the most sense for the agency to address this key issue first			0
by relegating it to last , the agency complicated how it will address other recommendations			0
for example , the task force said that the @entity1 should require plant owners to put measures into place to help workers cope with a loss of electric power and its on - site emergency backups , called a station blackout			1
the precedent comes from the @entity1 's post- 9/11 requirement that plant owners install portable diesel - fueled pumps and generators to protect their facilities from a prolonged station blackout caused by an aircraft attack			2
but because the @entity1 defines an aircraft attack as a beyond - design - basis event , it did not require that this equipment meet high quality and reliability standards , or be hardened to withstand other potential threats , such as natural disasters			2
indeed , @entity108 inspections have confirmed that some of the equipment at many plants would not survive earthquakes or floods			0
while the @entity1 deliberates , the nuclear industry has stepped into the breach with the " @entity120 " program , or @entity117 , designed as the foundation of its @entity2 response			1
under @entity117 , plant owners are supplementing and relocating the post- 9/11 equipment , ostensibly to better respond to severe natural disasters			0
plant owners are dispersing it on and near reactor sites but do n't plan to upgrade it to resist natural disasters			0
the industry is banking that enough equipment will be around so that some of it would be available in a catastrophe			0
the @entity1 proposed that plant owners provide reasonable protection for emergency equipment , but did not define how to meet this requirement			0
in the meantime , plant owners have purchased more than 300 pieces of @entity117 equipment without waiting for @entity1 guidelines , which will make it difficult for the agency to later institute standards that could force the industry to replace the equipment			1
last july , the @entity147 released recommendations for strengthening reactor safeguards			0
the @entity1 staff initially selected three of these recommendations -- enlarging emergency evacuation zones , expanding potassium iodide distribution , and accelerating the transfer of spent fuel from pools to dry casks -- for further evaluation			1
a few months later , however , the agency decided that its established approach in each area is adequate			0
for instance , the @entity1 justifies its one - size - fits - all , 10 - mile - radius emergency evacuation zone by arguing that evacuations could be expanded in a serious accident			1
but the agency has yet to explain how that would happen and will not be taking up this issue until a later date			0
the @entity1 is downplaying its task force 's most important recommendation and potentially undermining efforts to improve @entity27 reactor safety			1
the agency is not adequately addressing deficiencies in its emergency evacuation planning and spent fuel storage standards			1
all the while , the nuclear industry is outpacing the agency with a low - budget , voluntary and potentially ineffective plan			1
for the 116 million @entity27 who live within 50 miles of a nuclear plant , that 's cold comfort			0

writers : a year after @entity2 , the @entity1 is *dragging* heels on reactor safety proposals
@entity1 has taken up some of its task force recommendations , they say , but not the top one
they say the agency ignores its *inadequate* evacuation and spent fuel storage plans
writers : the nuclear industry is filling the gap with a low - budget , potentially ineffective plan
