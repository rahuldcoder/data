-- human activity and climate change have left about 75 % of the world 's coral reefs threatened , putting the livelihoods of many countries that depend on the ocean ecosystems at risk , according to a report released this week			1
local threats such as overfishing , coastal development , and watershed - and marine - based pollution are responsible for the immediate and direct threat to more than 60 % of the world 's reefs			2
add to that thermal stress from rising ocean temperatures and the number of threatened reefs jumps to 75 % , the @entity17 found in the report , titled " @entity23 , " released wednesday			2
" this report serves as a wake - up call for policy - makers , business leaders , ocean managers , and others about the urgent need for greater protection for coral reefs , " said @entity24 , administrator of the @entity25			0
" as the report makes clear , local and global threats , including climate change , are already having significant impacts on coral reefs , putting the future of these beautiful and valuable ecosystems at risk			1
" the threat is the highest in @entity44 where nearly 95 % of the region 's reefs are threatened , mainly due to overfishing and destructive fishing , according to the report			1
@entity50 , home to the world 's largest reef system , the @entity53 , had the lowest threat level at 14 %			2
the numbers represent an alarming trend : a dramatic increase in the percentage of reefs rated as threatened			0
according to the report , the level has increased by 30 % in 10 years , mainly due to a rise in overfishing and destructive fishing			1
the report attributes the rise to the growth in coastal populations in the @entity66 and @entity68 regions			0
similarly , climate change is playing an increasing role in the growing threat levels as the warming atmosphere causes ocean temperatures to rise			1
as a result , " mass coral bleaching , a stress response to warming waters , has occurred in every region and is becoming more frequent as higher temperatures recur , " the report says , noting that " extreme bleaching kills corals outright			1
" " our projections suggest that during the 2030s , roughly half of reefs globally will experience stress sufficient to induce severe bleaching in most years , " the study says			0
" during the 2050s , this percentage is expected to grow to more than 95 %			0
" many countries , especially small island nations in the @entity66 and @entity95 , rely on coral reefs for fishing , tourism and coastal protection , and the report says that " degradation and loss of reefs will result in significant social and economic impacts			0
" however , the report also notes that reefs have shown an ability to rebound from " extreme damage			1
" in order to help that recovery , " local threats must be tackled head - on with direct management interventions , while efforts to quickly and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions are of paramount concern not only for reefs but for nature and humanity as a whole , " the report says			0
former vice president @entity122 cautions in the report 's introduction that if efforts " fail to address the multiple threats they ( reefs ) face , we will likely see these precious ecosystems unravel , and with them the numerous benefits that people around the globe derive from these ecological wonders			0

causes are attributed to human activity and climate change
the threat is the highest in @entity44 , the report says
threat levels have risen 30 % in 10 years
corals are known to be resilient and have bounced back from " extreme damage "
