-- when is a touchscreen not a touchscreen ? increasingly , it 's when your smartphone reads your eyes , gestures and movements to perform basic functions without tapping the screen at all			1
that was @entity13 's point thursday with the rollout of the new @entity15 , the latest from the company 's flagship line and the first @entity19 - based phone to seriously challenge @entity21 's @entity20 for dominance in the mobile market			1
the phone will be available on all major @entity26 carriers by the end of april			0
from reading to web surfing to answering calls , the new handset will give users the ability to use the phone sometimes without even needing to hold it			2
@entity37 , after a hands - on with the device , declared that while it " falls short of being revolutionary , it brims with clever capabilities			2
" chief among those capabilities , the iconic product reviewers said , are its touch - free features			1
" you can do a lot with the @entity15 without ever touching it , " wrote @entity42 , who demoed the device			1
" the only other phones that can do this are @entity13 's jumbo - screen @entity49 , but those require you use an @entity52 , which the @entity15 does not have			1
" the non-touch feature that probably will get the most use is @entity55 , which lets you simply hover a finger ( or , we suppose , any alternate body part ) over the camera sensor to get a larger pop - up			1
it works with e-mail , photos and videos , calendars and the @entity67 's backed - in version of @entity68 , the news - aggregator app. this is similar to what users of the @entity73 can already do , but it does n't require the @entity73 stylus			1
layered on top of that is @entity79			1
users do n't even have to be holding their phone to use this			0
simply swipe a finger through the air sideways and you can toggle from screen to screen , or up and down to scroll through something you 're reading			1
air gestures also can be used to answer a phone call			0
again , all of these movements are tracked by the phone 's front - facing camera			1
@entity94 is an advance on a feature already available on the @entity97 it was rumored that the new phone would read eye movements , but instead it 's the user 's head that triggers this feature			0
it 's designed to tell when you 're actually looking at your screen , keeping its sleep mode from kicking in when you are and shutting down to save battery life when you 're not			2
now , @entity94 also will pause a video if you look away			0
" when ( you 're ) watching a video and suddenly someone calls you and you get distracted , the video automatically stops without pressing a thing , " @entity110 , executive vice president at @entity111 , said at thursday 's event			0
@entity117 builds on that feature			0
while you 're looking at the screen , you can tilt the phone backward or forward to scroll up and down			0
" while the ability to scroll by tilting a phone is a feature we 've seen on some earlier @entity19 models , its automated activation is new , " wrote @entity42 of @entity37			0
" i found this capability worked better than i thought it might , engaging quickly whenever i stared at the screen			0
" and there 's good news for owners of the @entity13 vice president @entity132 told @entity133 that they 'll be getting some of the iv 's software upgrades			1
" anything that we can do that 's not dependent on hardware like infrared , we 'll definitely bring to all the flagship devices , " he said			0
the question , of course , is whether users , even those excited about the phone and its new hardware and software , will actually use the gesture controls			0
@entity149 , managing editor of tech blog @entity151 , told @entity0 that he suspects the @entity15 's camera upgrades will be more significant			1
" it feels very gimmicky , " he said of the hands - free features			2
" the tricks about tracking your eyes and waving at the screen , i do n't think anybody 's really asking for that stuff			2
" what do you think about the new @entity67 phone 's features ? let us know in the comments .			2

@entity13 's @entity15 comes with a spate of no - touch features
@entity55 will let users *expand* content by hovering a finger over the screen
with @entity79 , scrolling or moving to new screen happens with a swipe
