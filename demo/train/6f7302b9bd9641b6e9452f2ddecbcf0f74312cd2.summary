-- two years ago , a major earthquake struck near the @entity3 capital of @entity4			1
up to 3 million people were killed , injured or displaced			2
in the wake of this disaster , aid flowed in via many channels -- including , notably , individual donations sent via text message			1
the @entity12 immediately launched a donate - by - text program , promoted heavily by the @entity14 and the mainstream media			2
relief agencies collected $ 43 million in donations via text after @entity3 quake -- sent $ 10 at a time by texting the word " @entity3 " to the shortcode 90999			1
( the donation appeared as a charge on donors ' phone bills			2
) who are these mobile givers ? what motivated them to give , and did their donations to @entity3 earthquake relief influence their future patterns of giving ? the @entity36 on wednesday released an in - depth study based on interviews with 863 people who sent donations to @entity3 via text message			1
@entity36 found that most of these donations were made on impulse -- an immediate response to media coverage of the disaster , especially on television			1
for three - quarters of them , it was the first time they 'd ever donated via text message			2
only a third of them made additional text donations to @entity3 earthquake relief			1
by and large , these donors did not research this donation beforehand			2
also , their interest in @entity3 's recovery waned quickly : more than half of the donors interviewed reported that they have not followed @entity3 relief and reconstruction efforts much or at all since making their donation			1
still , their willingness to donate to disaster relief by text did increase and that has benefited the victims of later disasters			1
according to @entity36 , " more than half of the donors surveyed have made text message contributions to other disaster relief efforts since their @entity3 donation			1
two in five of these donors ( 40 % ) texted a donation to groups helping people living in @entity84 following the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami , 27 % texted a donation to groups helping people living in the @entity91 @entity90 following the 2010 @entity93 oil spill , and 18 % texted a donation to groups helping victims of the 2011 tornadoes in the @entity91 taken together , 56 % of @entity3 mobile givers in our sample made a contribution to at least one of these events			1
" these donors reported also making donations by other channels : online web forms , by mail , and in person			1
but , interestingly , their least favorite donation channel was over a voice phone call			0
what 's special about mobile donors ? @entity36 found that they 're much like the average @entity91 , except that they tend to have more technology			1
for instance , nearly one - fourth of mobile donors own an e-reader , compared with just 9 % of @entity91 adults			2
( very similar figures apply to tablet ownership			0
) also 82 % own a laptop computer , vs. 57 % for the general population			0
mobile donors tend to do more things with their phones than the average @entity91			0
nearly three - quarters access the internet from their phone , vs. 44 % of the general population			0
more of them also use their phones to shoot photos or video or use e-mail			0
two - thirds of the @entity3 text donors were female , and they tend to be more highly educated than the general population			1
two - thirds also were white			0
@entity36 noted a significant social aspect to mobile giving -- but it 's not about social media			1
just over 40 % of mobile donors reported encouraging friends and family to donate by text to @entity3 earthquake relief			1
these efforts were surprisingly successful			0
according to @entity36 , " 76 % of these ' encouragers ' say that their friends or family members did indeed make a contribution to earthquake relief using their phones			1
@entity153 and young donors were particularly likely to spread the word among their friend networks			0
" but even though mobile donors are more likely than the average @entity91 to use social media , most of this encouraging happened in face - to - face conversations , not online			0
" of those who encouraged a friend or family member to contribute , 75 % did so by talking with others in person , and 38 % did so via voice call			0
by comparison , 34 % encouraged others to contribute by sending a text message , 21 % did so by posting on a social networking site and 10 % did so via email			0
" people can donate by text message to all sorts of causes and campaigns			0
many services such as @entity180 and @entity181 provide text - to - give services for nonprofits and campaigns			0
it 's unclear whether the patterns @entity36 spotted in the @entity3 relief text donors would apply to donations for causes other than disaster recovery -- but this field is growing fast			1
in 2012 , @entity91 should expect to be pelted with more text - to - give pleas than ever -- especially if you live in @entity194 or @entity195 , which are moving forward to allow political contributions by text			0
so far , text donations are not allowed for federal political campaigns , including the presidential race			2
in december 2010 the @entity201 ruled that those campaigns could not receive donations via text message			2
this would circumvent disclosure laws for political contributions -- currently anyone who gives more than $ 200 to a federal campaign must list their occupation and the name of their employer			0
however , the @entity215 reported on frenzied efforts under way to enable cell phone campaign donation methods that do not rely on text messages			2
stay tuned on that front			0
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity223 .			0
