-- when basketball legend @entity2 talked to the press after a @entity5 or @entity6 game , fans never got to see the superstar with sweat dripping from his brow or a towel wrapped around his waist after emerging from the shower			1
consciously aware of his image , @entity2 would dress in a side room and not in the main locker room with the other players			1
so when he emerged , he was suited and booted			0
some players would walk around naked , oblivious to the strangers standing there ; others had towel wraps on , even dressing with members of the media standing not 10 feet away			1
maybe @entity2 should put in a call to @entity25 , the @entity25 and the wife of prince @entity27 , and give her a lesson or two on what you need to do in this media - obsessed world -- now that photos of her breasts have been published by a @entity37 newspaper			1
brits are aghast at the breach of protocol , and @entity41 is threatening legal action			1
they are better off sitting @entity25 down with the same person who had to counsel @entity47 after his butt - naked romp in a @entity50 suite			1
royals to sue over nude photos look , i 'm not the least bit insensitive to the shock and horror of the young married couple seeing magazine photos of themselves sunbathing on private property in @entity37			1
yet my mama and daddy always taught me that if you do n't want someone to see your private parts , then do n't show them in public for someone to see			2
over decades now , we have become accustomed to the crazed antics of the paparazzi invading the personal space of celebrities			0
@entity74 shots of @entity75 or @entity76 getting out of cars ? check			0
no - talent celebrities like @entity79 starring in sex tapes to pave the way to the land of riches ? check			2
cell phone videos of celebs doing whatever to whomever they want in nightclubs ? check			0
our culture not only has accepted it , we revel in it			0
seriously , do you think all of those celebrity magazines and websites with photos of stars walking to the store to get coffee lose money ? no. we live in the age of voyeurism , and the long lenses of the paparazzi satisfy our insatiable desire for the garbage			0
" mindless entertainment " is what i 've heard folks call it			0
just mindless is how i 'll classify it			0
@entity113 tabloid publishes topless royal photos it would be great if celebs could be themselves			0
and it 's terrible that folks ca n't drop the pretenses and have dinner with friends without thinking someone has a phone video camera on them and is capturing private remarks			2
but that world left us long ago , and it 's not coming back			1
as long as photographers can reap six - figure pay days , and websites can rack up millions of page views and charge advertisers more money , every boob shot of a celeb will be shown			2
call it despicable and degrading , but it also creates a situation that requires common sense			0
@entity25 , unless you know for sure that no one else 's prying eyes -- or camera -- will see you , do n't sunbathe naked			1
all of the screaming and righteous indignation wo n't do a darn thing to stop the next celeb or royal family member who chooses to show up in his or her birthday suit			2
blame the photographer all day ( and it 's a job i would never want )			0
but if she never takes the top off outside , we 're not having this discussion			2
@entity158 , @entity2 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			1

@entity161 : @entity2 , aware of his image , kept *covered* up , even in locker room
he says @entity2 could advise @entity25 : in media - obsessed world , cover up
he says royals can be aghast if they want , but lurid pictures sell and *people* want to be shocked
@entity161 : the world of privacy is gone , not coming back ; if you 're famous , do n't sunbathe naked
