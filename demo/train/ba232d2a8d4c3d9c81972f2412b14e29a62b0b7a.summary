-- @entity1 continued their lavish spending spree by sealing the capture of @entity5 international @entity4 from @entity6 in a deal reportedly worth $ 37 million			1
@entity4 put pen to paper on a five - year deal with the @entity12 side as @entity13 traveled in the opposite direction			1

@entity4 's transfer was mooted long before he went to the @entity36 with @entity5 , but he played his last game for @entity6 in their 3 - 0 defeat of @entity40 on the opening day of the @entity12 season on saturday			1
he told @entity1 's official website : " it did n't take too much selling by the boss when you see the players who are already here and the plans for the club			2
" the last thing he said to me was " be ready for the next game , " and then he said " be ready to win the @entity12 , " and that 's my ultimate aim - that 's what i want to do and why i 'm here			2
" there 's a lot of competition to get there , it 's where we all want to be			0
i 'm ambitious and i want to win trophies here			0
i believe this is a great place to do that and i believe we will do it			0
hopefully , sooner rather than later			0
" the move seems to have gone on a long time - now all i want to do is get out on the field and play			2
i 'm ready and raring to go now we 've finally got everything done			0
i ca n't wait to start a new chapter			0
" @entity19 said he was delighted to finally seal the deal for @entity4 : " i am very happy to have @entity4 with us , everybody knows we have admired him for some time			1
" he is an excellent midfielder , who can play in a number of positions			0
this is important for the team , and i am looking forward to seeing him play for us			0
we have a very strong squad , and this signing is a very important one for us			2
" @entity4 is already a very good player , who has proved he can play at the very top level			2
but he is also young and a good character			0
" as for @entity13 , the 23 - year - old ended his five - year association with @entity1 to move to @entity87 , after slipping down the pecking order at @entity89			1
he told @entity6 's official website : " for me , my number one target is to work hard for my team - mates , show them what i can bring to the table , show them they can rely on me and that i am going to work hard for them week in , week out			1
