the @entity1 on tuesday resumed its participation in airstrikes against @entity5 , the country said -- its first publicly known foray against the terror group since it reportedly suspended attacks over concerns about pilot safety			1
@entity1 f - 16s stationed in @entity13 took part in morning attacks and returned safely to base , the @entity1 military said without saying where the strikes happened			1
a @entity20 - led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against @entity5 in @entity21 and @entity22 , where the @entity24 extremist group has captured territory for what it calls its @entity28 caliphate			1
the @entity1 halted its participation in the strikes in december because leaders were worried there were insufficient plans to save personnel who may be captured , a senior @entity20 military official told @entity2			0
the safety issue was highlighted by the case of @entity13 military pilot @entity38 , whom @entity5 captured in december after his jet crashed in @entity21			1
last week , @entity5 released a video showing its fighters burning @entity42 to death			0
a representative of the @entity1 government told @entity2 that no comment would be offered about the airstrike suspension			0
@entity5 declared it had established a caliphate spanning @entity22 and @entity21 last year			2
since then , it has gone on a murderous rampage that has included beheadings of foreigners			0
there are about 20,000 fighters in @entity21 who belong to terror groups such as @entity5 , the director of the @entity56 will tell a @entity57 on wednesday , according to remarks obtained by @entity2			2
" the @entity20 and our allies are increasingly concerned with the more than 20,000 foreign fighters who have traveled to @entity21 from over 90 different countries , " @entity59 plans to tell the @entity60			1
that is 1,000 higher than the number of foreign fighters in an estimate given by intelligence officials in january			0
the numbers of @entity70 -- 3,400 -- and @entity20 -- 150 -- who have gone to @entity21 are similar to numbers given by officials in recent months			0
hundreds of thousands of @entity22 and @entity21 have fled areas @entity5 has seized			2
the @entity20 , along with @entity76 and @entity77 nations , began airstrikes against the terror group last summer			0
@entity82 fighters have captured three important bridgeheads on the @entity85 near the northern @entity22 city of @entity87 , developments that further restricts @entity5 ' movement outside @entity22 's second - largest municipality , @entity20 military and @entity82 officials said tuesday			1
@entity5 took control of @entity87 in june			0
but @entity82 ground forces , as well as airstrikes from the @entity20 - led coalition , recently have tried to cut off @entity87 's lines of supply to @entity5 in @entity21 , setting up what could be an eventual assault by the @entity22 military later this year to expel the terror group from the city			1
the three captured bridgeheads are on the west bank of the @entity85 north of @entity87 , @entity104 and @entity82 officials said			2
besides hindering @entity5 ' movement outside the city , the @entity82 ' gains would protect key points through which an operation to liberate @entity87 could take place			1
@entity87 is a predominantly @entity77 city , though the @entity82 have an autonomous region to the north and east			0
few expect the @entity82 to be involved in clearing @entity87 of @entity5 -- that would be a job for @entity22 government security forces			1
but with @entity87 so close to their territory , the @entity82 do have an interest in choking off @entity5 and preventing them from advancing			2
@entity82 fighters battle equipment woes as well as @entity5 in northern @entity22 @entity22 ground forces could begin a move to retake the city as soon as april , a @entity104 official told @entity2 last week			1
