the number of aircraft near misses more than doubled last year , but @entity3 aviation officials tied the increase to new systems that report mistakes not caught previously			1
there were 4,394 cases in which planes came too close to one another in the year ending september 1 , 2012 -- up from 1,895 the year before , the @entity11 said on thursday			1
forty - one events were characterized as " high - risk events			2
" none resulted in accidents			0
the @entity11 had predicted an increase as it phased in a program to monitor radar and automatically report problems			1
the agency says it is a victim of its own success			0
with commercial aircraft accidents rare -- or non-existent in some recent years -- it is difficult to use accident data to identify trends			0
so the @entity11 has placed a greater emphasis on looking at " precursors " to accidents , such as " loss of separation " events in which aircraft come closer together than intended			1
" we are covering electronically and identifying things that we never did before , " said one @entity11 official , speaking on condition of anonymity			1
the 4,394 " losses of separation " in 2012 occurred during 132 million take - offs and landings			1
put another way , that 's 3.3 incidents per 100,000 operations , the @entity11 said			1
" if you want a measure of safety , that 's the number , " the official said			0
@entity11 has various separation standards , depending on air space and aircraft			2
at high altitudes , planes should be separated by at least five miles horizontally or 1,000 feet vertically			0
nearer to airports , planes can be closer together			0
the agency said it has worked with its workforce and the controllers ' union to change the safety culture of the agency -- emphasizing collection of data over punishment			0
under the new non-punitive reporting system , controllers are encouraged to voluntarily report mistakes and problems			2
it has buttressed that with an automated system that monitors air traffic , reporting problems to headquarters without any influence from the local facility			1
as a result of five different reporting systems , the number of reports grew 10-fold in 2012			2
officials said the new system makes comparisons with previous years misleading			0
information collected in 2012 and 2013 will create a new baseline for meaningful comparisons in the future			0
of the 4,394 " loss of separation " incidents , the @entity11 said 1,271 involved cases where the planes came 34 percent closer than allowed			1
of those , it characterized 1,048 as " low risk " events , 182 as " medium risk , " and 41 as " high risk			0

@entity11 says year - over - year increase *due* to better reporting
