-- for a comedy like " @entity2 " -- which is to say , a comedy with a message about as deep as a bowl of beer nuts -- familiarity with @entity7 's disguise plays and @entity8 is n't a prerequisite for getting the picture			2
on the other hand , familiarity with both body - switch comedies and @entity14 laffers is indispensable for understanding just where this raunchy @entity14 imitation with a heart of @entity18 goes wrong			2
the anatomy swappers here are @entity21 ( @entity22 ) , a swingin ' , irresponsible single guy , and @entity24 ( @entity25 ) , a driven lawyer / husband / dad			1
the switcheroo goes down because the two buddies - since - childhood do something stupid during a @entity32 in their hometown of @entity34 : they pee in a fountain			2
specifically , they pee in a fountain presided over by a stony statue of the @entity41 goddess @entity42 while drunkenly declaring to each other , '' i wish i had your life ! '' ( for the record , @entity42 is the goddess of counsel , advice , planning , and cunning			1
) @entity24 thinks he envies @entity21 's life of free sex and fiscal irresponsibility			1
@entity21 , a wannabe actor , thinks he envies @entity24 's successful career , his loving home life , and his cute wife ( @entity56 )			1
crash , lightning , temporary power outage , " freaky friday ! " the deal is done			2
the next day each guy wakes up in the body of the other			0
discovery of genital distinctions follows			0
here 's " @entity2 's " first mistake : as set up by director @entity68 ( " @entity72 " ) and writers @entity69 and @entity71 ( " @entity73 " ) , the game is rigged			0
@entity24 may be burned - out , so much so that he has stopped appreciating his squeaky @entity56 of a wife			1
he may even feel a pang or two of extramarital lust at the sight of his beautiful law associate @entity79 -- as played by @entity80 , who would n't ? but no one would envy @entity21 's directionless , idiotic @entity84 life -- even if @entity84 entertains the ladies in a playpen of an apartment			1
the early @entity21 is so excessively unsocialized and unlikable ( i blame the script and direction rather than @entity22 ' game performance ) that there 's no contest : @entity24 may need a little kick in the khakis to realize that he 's got it pretty good at home , but he 's clearly the movie 's winner			1
in fact , early @entity21 is so obnoxious that in the end , when the two friends regain their own bodies , having learned lessons in gratitude ( oops , did i give something away ? ) , @entity24 is more or less @entity24 again			1
but @entity108 bears little resemblance to early @entity21			1
he 's still @entity22 - y , but he 's now someone a lot more like @entity24 -- reformed by the traditional values " @entity2 " endorses -- than like a guy who previously kept a weekly sex date with a lady he described as a tigress			1
i wo n't give away more about the tigress in question ; let 's just say she bounces and veers from " @entity121 " turf into @entity122			0
and she also personifies " @entity2 's " second mistake : the movie 's scenes of id - fueled transgression are alternately desperate , trite , and an off - putting color of ugly -- as if the filmmakers were given the ingredients but not the cooking instructions for a successful crude - but - cuddly frittata			0
gross - outs involving poop -- kids of all ages usually love ' em ! -- are more humiliating than hilarious			0
( really , the old toxic - baby - diaper gag ? ) freakish - looking women are easy receptacles for disgust			0
and when jokes give way to the '' i love you , bro ! '' finale , the tone oozes past charming happiness all the way to cloying self - satisfaction			0
anyway ! there 's one consolation , and that 's in watching the stars play opposite what is often their type of guy			0
@entity25 , in particular , is enjoyably nimble and unbuttoned when he sheds his usual persona of responsible - and - exasperated guy and lets some devil out			1
quick - witted and a pro at physical shifts , he finds more subtleties in his @entity164 than actually appear in his dialogue			0
and that resourcefulness rubs off on @entity22 , a pleasant if less complex performer			1
acting here as if he were a vaguely disgruntled but resigned grown - up , @entity22 gets to escape the tonal confines of his boyish smile			2
too bad " @entity2 " has little use for such interestingness			0
soon enough it 's back to stale jokes about spousal date nights , the sight of moldy fast - food leftovers in a bachelor 's refrigerator , and the timeless male joys of sharing a whiz in an outdoor fountain after a night of drinking and bulls ---			2
