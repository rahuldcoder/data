-- @entity2 and @entity3 officials held migration talks for the first time in more than two years on wednesday			1
some saw the meeting as a sign that long - frigid relations between the two nations are slowly thawing			1
but others said that the meeting was overshadowed by the @entity3 weapons shipment to @entity13 uncovered by @entity15 authorities this week			1
@entity2 and @entity3 officials met in @entity17 for the first time since january 2011 to discuss implementing 1994 and 1995 agreements that regulate travel between the @entity2 and @entity3 , known as the @entity2 - @entity21			1
" the @entity2 delegation highlighted areas of successful cooperation in migration , including advances in aviation safety and visa processing , while also identifying actions needed to ensure that the goals of the accords are fully met , especially those having to do with safeguarding the lives of intending immigrants , " the @entity22 said in a statement after wednesday 's meeting			1
for its part , @entity3 's delegation said " the meeting took place in a climate of respect			1
" but after the meeting , it appeared that key sticking points between the two countries remained unresolved			0
the @entity22 said the @entity2 repeated its call for @entity3 to release @entity48 , a @entity22 contractor who has been jailed in @entity3 since 2009			1
and the @entity3 delegation once again criticized @entity2 migration policies toward the island			1
under migration accords with @entity3 , the @entity2 gives at least 20,000 @entity3 a year visas to immigrate to the @entity2 legally			2
but the @entity2 ' so - called " wet foot , dry foot " policy means @entity3 who reach @entity2 soil are not sent back to @entity3 , which @entity3 authorities say leads to an increase in illegal journeys			2
in a statement , the @entity3 delegation said it " reiterated its willingness to maintain these exchanges in the future , given their importance to both countries			0
" but will concerns over @entity3 's weapons shipment that @entity15 seized from a @entity13 boat this week put a stop to such talks ? @entity3 has said the 240 - metric - ton weapons stash consisted of obsolete equipment it was sending to @entity13 for repair			1
@entity15 has asked the @entity76 to investigate whether the shipment violates the organization 's @entity13 weapons bans			2
in the meantime , several @entity2 lawmakers who are critics of @entity3 's government have said the situation is a warning sign that @entity2 officials ca n't ignore			1
" while we are in these discussions ... what does the @entity87 regime do ? it is violating international laws			0
why are we having these talks ? we should suspend these talks because of this violation , " rep. @entity93 , r - @entity94 , told @entity0 en @entity96 ol wednesday			0
in a letter to @entity2 secretary of state @entity100 , sen. @entity101 of @entity94 , a frequent @entity3 government critic , described the weapons shipment as a " flagrant violation of multiple @entity104			1
" " i believe that this revelation , in addition to @entity3 's failure to address its abysmal human rights record , should finally prompt the ( @entity110 ) administration to re-calibrate its misguided and naive @entity3 policy , " @entity101 wrote			2
" the administration should immediately reverse its january 2011 decision easing restrictions on people - to - people travel and remittances sent to @entity3 ; as well as immediately halt granting visas to @entity3 government officials			0
" but others argued that it would be unwise to cut off talks over the matter			0
" i do not think it should affect the conversations , because there is much at play , and things have advanced a lot , and it is a conversation that is beneficial for the @entity2 and beneficial for @entity3 , " said @entity123 , president of the @entity17 - based @entity124 think tank			2
if anything , the seizure of the @entity13 boat shows the importance of more dialogue with countries like @entity3 and @entity13 , said @entity139 of the @entity140			0
" what creates the problem are the sanctions			0
this is part of a problem that is going to continue with @entity3 and is going to continue with @entity13 until ... they negotiate an exit so they can become part of the international community , " he told @entity0 en @entity145			0
" when one is forced to live in darkness , the same darkness creates a lack of transparency			0
" @entity22 spokeswoman @entity158 told reporters wednesday that the issue of the ship was unlikely to be a topic during the migration meeting			0
" i would say that we have told the @entity3 that we will discuss with them very soon the ship , " she said , " but we 're focused on the migration talks , specifically on migration - related issues			2
" @entity0 's @entity170 contributed to this report .			0
