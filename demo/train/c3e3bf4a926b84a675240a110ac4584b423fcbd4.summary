@entity0 -- the most emotionless society is @entity3 's despite its reputation for being among the world 's richest , a new survey has revealed			1
@entity7 looked at 150 countries where about 1,000 residents were asked whether they experienced five positive and five negative emotions a lot during the course of a day			1
the results were based on interviews taken over a three - year period			2
questions included whether people felt well - rested or enjoyment , smiled and laughed or felt worry , sadness , stress or anger			2
the 36 % in @entity3 who reported feeling anything is the lowest in the world , the @entity25 - based research and analytics organization found			1
this figure is an aggregation of data from 2009 - 2011 ; in @entity7 's latest measure taken last year , just 30 % of those surveyed in @entity3 felt anything at all			1
the findings belie @entity3 's 1.9 % jobless rate in the third quarter and per capita gdp of more than us $ 50,000 -- among the highest in the world			1
" the implications for an emotionless society are significant , " wrote @entity38 , a partner at @entity7 and director of the @entity40			1
" to continue to be competitive in today 's world , @entity3 must begin focusing on behavioral - based indicators that move beyond gdp			1
" the bottom line is that @entity3 are productive , highly disciplined citizens who are not enjoying their lives much , " he wrote in an accompanying article for the @entity48			1
" this culture has won historically , but it will not move to the next level until its leadership takes wellbeing seriously			0
" trailing right behind @entity3 were nearly half of the 15 former @entity57 republics : @entity58 and @entity59 , with 37 % ; and @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , with 38 %			1
tying at 38 % were @entity65 and @entity66			2
the @entity67 , meanwhile , registered as the most emotional nation , with 60 % of those interviewed responding " yes " to experiencing a lot of feelings daily			1
also scoring high were @entity73 nations , with 10 of its nations -- led by @entity76 -- sharing top spots with @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and the @entity81			2
absent from the list is @entity83 , whose 4th king first coined the term " @entity87 , " declaring in 1972 that it was more important than @entity88			2
the country now has a @entity87 ( @entity87 ) commission with a mandate to pursue that objective			0
the country 's latest @entity94 measures happiness based on 33 indicators grouped among nine domains : psychological wellbeing , health , time use , education , cultural diversity and resilience , good governance , community vitality , ecological diversity and resilience , and living standards			0
reflecting the growing need to address happiness , @entity109 at @entity110 published the first ever @entity113 commissioned for the @entity114 on happiness in april			0
it reviews the state of happiness in the world today , the causes of happiness and misery , and policy implications			0
the report was in answer to a resolution adopted last year by the @entity126 declaring " the pursuit of happiness is a fundamental human goal " embodying the spirit of the 2015 @entity130			0
this year the @entity126 declared march 20 of each year as the @entity131			0
last month the @entity132 , which represents 34 countries , dedicated its fourth forum in @entity135 , @entity136 , to measuring well - being			0
the @entity132 's @entity137 compares well - being across countries based on 11 topics identified as essential			0
it 's another indication that there 's more to life or success than wealth , and that measuring a nation on gdp alone can go only so far			2
still , the @entity147 has named @entity3 one of the best countries to be born in 2013			1
ranked sixth on an index topped by @entity151 , @entity3 was cited along with @entity0 , ranked 10th , as being " well - known for their wealth , stability and relatively low levels of corruption , " said @entity157 , an analyst			1
" one determining factor of future life satisfaction for their residents , which is less easy to predict , will be the trajectory of civil freedoms , " she added in a press release			0
the index looked at as many as 11 indicators , including gdp per head , life expectancy at birth , quality of family life , the state of political freedoms , job security , climate , safety , community life , governance and gender equality			0
among the 80 countries covered , @entity180 ranked last .			0
