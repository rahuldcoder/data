-- defending champion @entity1 edged towards another milestone with the 49th @entity4 title of her career on sunday , coming from behind to beat @entity6 in the final of the @entity8 in @entity9			1
the world @entity10 , who is seeking to become only the 10th woman to have reached a half - century , triumphed for the third time on the green clay at @entity8 as she won 12 of the last 14 games			2
the @entity16 , who had a similar run in vanquishing @entity19 to claim a record sixth @entity21 title last weekend , posted a 3 - 6 6 - 0 6 - 2 victory in just under two hours			1
@entity6 , herself former top - ranked player but 18th going into this event , had hopes she might repeat her 2008 @entity27 win on red clay over @entity1 as she won a 45 - minute opening set			1
but , after an argument over the @entity32 apparently trying to take her serve too quickly , the 15 - time grand slam champion stepped up a gear to control the match			2
" i felt so close in that first set			0
i felt like i could have been up 3 - 0 , " said @entity1 , the only woman to have won more than $ 40 million in prize money			1
" she was playing really , really well , but it was just a shot here , a shot there , and she played really well in the big points			0
and i had so many opportunities that i missed			0
she took advantage of that , and she went on to glory in that first set			0
" after that i just got really relaxed and was like , ' @entity1 , you have to chill out and not get crazy and if you win , great			2
if not , you 're trying			0
just do the best you can			0
' " she won despite double - faulting on her first match point and hitting the net with a forehand on her second , but still managed 27 winners against 13 unforced errors in those last two sets , having been 12 - 123 in the first			0
the 31 - year - old , who beat older sister @entity59 in saturday 's semifinals , took her career record to @entity6 to 6 - 4 and extended her record to 75 - 4 since the start of the 2012 clay season a year ago			1
@entity6 had won 14 of her last 16 matches , reaching the semis in @entity21 and winning the 13th title of her career in @entity68			2
" i thought i played pretty well in that first set -- i was holding my serve and then waiting for my chance to break , " @entity6 said			0
" in the second set i had 40 - 15 in that first game and then again in another couple of games i had 40 - 15 , 40 - 0			2
i should have focused and gotten those games			0
" meanwhile , the @entity75 became the first team through to the semifinals of the men 's @entity79 competition on sunday , completing a 3 - 1 win over @entity82 in @entity83			1
@entity84 won 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 6 - 7 ( 2 - 7 ) 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 6 - 2 over @entity85 to earn a home clash with @entity87 in september			1
it also put the defending champions top of the @entity91 nation rankings , ending @entity93 's four - year reign			0
@entity87 went through with a 3 - 2 win at home to @entity96 , as world no. 71 @entity97 upset 13th - ranked @entity99 6 - 4 5 - 7 6 - 4 6 - 4 in the decisive rubber			1
world no. 8 @entity101 had leveled the tie by earlier beating @entity104 6 - 3 6 - 3 6 - 0			1
in the other quarterfinals , @entity32 won 3 - 1 against the @entity16 as world no. 1 @entity106 battled to a 7 - 5 6 - 7 ( 4 - 7 ) 6 - 1 6 - 0 victory over @entity108 in @entity109			1
@entity106 suffered an injury scare when he twisted his ankle in the third game of the match , but was able to continue with painkillers while the usually strong - serving @entity108 struggled with his own shoulder problem			0
the @entity32 took a 2 - 1 lead in saturday 's epic doubles rubber , as @entity119 and @entity120 defeated top - ranked @entity121 and @entity122 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 7 - 6 ( 7 - 1 ) 5 - 7 4 - 6 15 - 13 in a match lasting almost four and a half hours			1
@entity32 , the 2010 champions , will next face @entity126 or @entity127			0
