@entity0 is president of @entity1 , a nonprofit advocacy group that supports equality and freedom of speech and religion			1
an attorney who has been recognized as one of the most influential lawyers in @entity8 , she appeared frequently before the @entity8 @entity9 from 1986 - 1997 , arguing in favor of retaining a legal right to abortion			0
before joining @entity1 , she was executive producer of @entity13 , a radio show about law and @entity8 life and senior research administrator with the @entity17			0
@entity0 says @entity19 's selection upset activists who supported @entity21 ( @entity22 ) -- the announcement that pastor @entity19 has been chosen to give the invocation at @entity21 's inauguration ceremony landed with a thud in my inbox			1
many people who know @entity19 as the affable megachurch pastor and best - selling author may be confused about the anger and disappointment that his selection has generated among progressive activists who worked so hard to help elect @entity21			1
here 's my explanation ; you can find plenty of other voices online			0
@entity19 enjoys a reputation as a bridge - building moderate based on his informal style and his church 's engagement on issues like @entity45			1
he took grief from some of his @entity49 colleagues when he invited then - senator @entity21 to his church for a conference on @entity45 a couple of years ago			1
and , in august he hosted presidential candidates @entity21 and @entity53 at his church			2
@entity19 has worked hard to cultivate a moderate public personality but his views are very similar to those of traditional @entity57 an email sent before the 2004 election he wrote a @entity62 message proclaiming that , for @entity69 voters , the issues of abortion , marriage for same - sex couples , stem cell research , cloning and euthanasia were " non-negotiable			1
" in fact , he said , they are " not even debatable because @entity75 's word is clear on these issues			0
" and while some @entity49 leaders were nervous that @entity19 would give @entity21 a platform to talk about poverty and the environment at the august event , @entity19 thrilled them by eschewing those issues entirely in order to emphasize issues like abortion and marriage that worked to @entity53 's advantage with the evangelical audience			1
ireport.com : your thoughts on @entity19 @entity19 also campaigned for @entity91 , the initiative that stripped same - sex couples in @entity93 of their right under the state constitution to get legally married			2
but it 's not just his support for @entity98			1
8 that is so galling to equality activists			0
it 's that @entity19 , in an interview with @entity103 , has since equated allowing loving same - sex couples to get married with redefining marriage to permit incest and pedophilia			2
and he has repeated one of the @entity49 's big lies : that somehow allowing marriage equality to stand would have threatened the freedom of preachers like him to say what they thought about homosexuality			2
that 's not remotely true , but it 's a standard tool of @entity49 leaders trying to resist the public 's increasing support for equality			2
in other words , @entity19 has been divisive and dishonest on the issues of marriage equality and religious freedom -- and on other issues important to many @entity21 supporters , as well			1
he adamantly opposes a woman 's legal right to abortion and dismisses common - ground efforts to reduce the need for abortion by comparing them to accommodating the @entity134			2
he is disrespectful of progressive people of faith , suggesting that they are tools of the @entity138 or more @entity139 than @entity69			0
so much for the values of unity and respect , not to mention the constitutional principle of equality , on which president - elect @entity21 campaigned			0
why exactly is he being given the high honor of delivering the invocation at one of the most historic ceremonies in @entity8 history ? there is no shortage of religious leaders who reflect the values on which president - elect @entity21 campaigned and who are working to advance the common good			1
rev. @entity156 , who has been selected to give the benediction , is a lifelong advocate for justice			0
there are others like him , and in our increasingly diverse nation , they are n't all @entity69			0
@entity19 gets plenty of attention through his books and media appearances and has every right to promote his religious views			1
but he does n't need or deserve a position of honor at the inauguration of a president who has given hope to so many @entity8 by rejecting the politics of division and emphasizing his commitment to constitutional values			1
i am still excited about the tremendous changes in policy that i expect under an @entity21 administration			0
but it 's the job of progressive advocates to hold public officials accountable , and to speak up even when our friends drop the ball			0
this decision , which will leave a bad taste in the mouths of many passionate supporters of @entity21 , is one of those times			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0 .			0

@entity0 : @entity19 has image of a moderate religious leader
she says his views are closer to those of the @entity49
@entity0 : @entity19 backed @entity98 . 8 and opposed abortion and stem cell research
she says he does n't deserve position of honor at @entity21 's inauguration
