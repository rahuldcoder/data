@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , @entity4 , is 5,000 miles away from @entity0 , @entity1			1
but representatives of the 192 nations gathering this week at the climate change conference need to keep the memory of a flooded @entity0 in mind			1
two years ago this month , the @entity10 was launched to help the families of @entity0 ' @entity12 rebuild their lives and community			1
that was already two years after @entity16 , and the once - vibrant neighborhood was still in ruins , failed by government and frustrated by a lack of progress			1
working with the @entity12 community , with families who lost everything in @entity16 , with cutting - edge architects and inventive builders , we learned some truths and made some discoveries we would like to share with the climate change negotiators in @entity3 : we need urgent action			1
climate change is real and happening now			0
the world already is reeling from the consequences -- rising sea levels , more violent storms , more frequent flooding and prolonged droughts			2
@entity16 , the killer heat wave in @entity45 , @entity41 's floods and the enduring drought in @entity43 are not anomalies , they are harbingers			1
it is not enough to attack what causes global warming ; we also must prepare to live with it			1
we must reduce carbon emissions and adapt to the changing climate			2
even if greenhouse gas emissions stopped increasing today , the climate would continue to change for generations because of the gases that are already in the atmosphere			2
people will go home , even if home is in harm 's way			2
the pull of family , friends and happy memories proved irresistible for many in the @entity12			0
the common history and culture of any community will keep people living in flood plains , along earthquake faults , and on shorelines , if those places are home			2
more people are moving into harm 's way			2
the number of people who live at the water 's edge will continue to grow			1
the @entity12 is not unique -- more than 50 percent of @entity83 's population lives within 50 miles of a coast , according to the @entity85			2
the same percentage applies to the world 's population			2
in the @entity83 , @entity85 predicts the number will rise as high as 75 percent by 2050 or sooner			0
governments were formed to protect their citizens -- and not just from armed marauders			0
solutions exist to protect people and allow them to live safely in their homes			1
the consequences of climate change require every community to make changes that will increase safety and survivability			0
in @entity103 , we are building affordable homes designed to use less energy , reduce carbon emissions and run on solar power , as well as weather the next storm			0
our storm - resistant features include high foundations to keep homes well above base flood levels ; hurricane - resistant fabric to protect windows ; increased structural durability to withstand 130 - mph or higher winds ; and access to the rooftop -- because so many of @entity16 's victims died trapped in their attics			1
this approach should be adopted by coastal - area builders around the globe			0
government has a unique and powerful role to play			0
individual actions add up , but they pale compared to the reach and resources of government			0
we saw firsthand after @entity16 how deadly and devastating it can be for a government to fail its citizens			1
today , we still see boarded - up houses , razed landscapes and blighted neighborhoods across @entity0 -- over four years after the @entity138 - built levees failed			1
there are large - scale solutions that only governments can provide -- such as setting emissions standards and initiating adaptation measures			0
these options are available to the participants in @entity3			1
it is time for the world 's governments to step up			1
we are facing the most serious challenge to the health and well - being of the world since @entity154 but instead of putting shoulders to the wheel , the leaders of the world are busy lowering expectations and tempering outcomes			0
instead , we ask them to act with urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and embrace solutions that will help our children survive and thrive in a changing climate			0
they have the power to put the planet on a smarter , safer path to a low - carbon future and to protect us and generations to come			0
we ask them to use it			0
to quote @entity178 , a climate - change expert from @entity180 , " this is real , this is real , this is real			0
so act now , the ball 's in your court			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			1

@entity186 directs foundation that helps @entity0 *residents* rebuild their community
he says @entity16 , flooded @entity0 offer lessons for @entity3 meeting
@entity186 : @entity197 is reeling from global warming ; effects will continue and we must adapt
solutions exist , but it 's time for the *international* community to step up , he says
