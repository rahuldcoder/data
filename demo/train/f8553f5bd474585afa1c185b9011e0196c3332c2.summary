@entity0 will likely run for president of the @entity2			0
but forgive the @entity2 's neighbors to the @entity4 for thinking the former secretary of state is considering a bid at prime minster , too			0
since leaving the @entity8 in 2013 , @entity0 has headlined six events in @entity10 and organizers in the country announced two more appearances in two different provinces on monday			1
@entity15 will speak at an event in @entity17 , @entity18 sponsored by @entity19 , a large bank in @entity10 , on january 21 , 2015 , according to this ticket page			1
that same day , @entity15 will speak at a similar event - also sponsored by @entity19 , in @entity22 , @entity23 , according to a press release			0
the opportunities in @entity10 not only allow her to make money off of speaker fees , but it gives her a platform to discuss global affairs and her time running the @entity8 , a subject she 's pretty comfortable revisiting			1
with the addition of these appearances , @entity15 has now headlined events in six of @entity10 's ten provinces ( the country also has three territories )			1
her other appearances include : june 20 , 2013 in @entity41 , @entity42 for @entity43			0
march 5 , 2014 in @entity44 , @entity45 for @entity46 's women 's @entity47 march 6 , 2014 in @entity48 , @entity49 for an event organized by @entity51 march 18 , 2014 in @entity52 , @entity53 for a speech to the @entity55 june 16 , 2014 in @entity56 , @entity49 for an event promoting her memoir " @entity60 " october 6 , 2014 for the @entity61 , @entity42 for an event organized by @entity63 ( @entity15 was interviewed on stage by @entity19 ceo @entity65 at this event ) @entity15 's events in @entity10 have run the gamut , from speeches at high priced dinners to question and answer sessions in theaters			1
most have been promoted and organized by @entity51 , a special events and conference organizer in @entity10			0
@entity76 's calls to the group went unanswered on monday			0
one thing is consistent for nearly every event @entity15 does in @entity10 : at some point , she is asked about the @entity82			1
at her june event in @entity56 , @entity15 gave hope to both sides of the debate over the 1,179 - mile - long project that would move oil from @entity10 to refineries in the @entity2 , but declined to comment on whether she would approve the project or not			2
" i do believe that both @entity10 and the @entity2 can become even richer , more prosperous , but also more environmentally sustainable by having a broad engagement over energy and climate and not focusing everything on this one decision , " @entity15 said			2
obviously , if @entity15 runs for president in 2016 , she will not be able to take money from @entity10 or win a non-existent @entity10 primary			2
but after her visit to @entity61 in october , one headline pointed to the fact that @entity15 's visit may be more than that : " @entity0 winning hearts , if not voters , in @entity61 " .			0

@entity15 announced monday two events in @entity10 that will take place early next year
after those 2 events , @entity15 will have headlined events in 60 *%* of @entity10 's provinces
the events offer @entity15 a *chance* to talk about her experience running the state *department*
