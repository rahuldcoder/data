@entity0 -- as the last @entity4 soldiers exited @entity5 and debate was raging about the nation 's future , political crisis erupted in @entity0 that raised fears of more sectarian strife to come			1
@entity11 , a powerful political bloc that draws support largely from @entity15 and more secular @entity14 , said it was boycotting parliament , a move that threatens to shatter @entity14 's fragile power - sharing government			1
the move pits the largely @entity15 and secular coalition against the government of @entity23 prime minister @entity22			1
@entity11 contends @entity22 is trying to amass dictatorial power and many believe @entity22 was simply waiting for the @entity4 to leave before making his move			1
it all makes for burgeoning political chaos and raises serious questions about whether democracy and human rights can take root in the war - ravaged nation			1
" the only country that makes @entity4 politics look like a picnic is @entity14 , " said @entity35 , the former @entity4 ambassador in @entity0			0
@entity22 , @entity35 said , is a man who perceives concessions as weakness			0
he 's a tough guy who knows what he 's doing , @entity35 said			0
he managed to forge relationships with the @entity43 and peel off some @entity15 support to build the majority he needed to put together a government , @entity35 said			2
but whether he is the man to unify @entity14 , to lead it now , without @entity4 presence , is uncertain			0
his rivals say that @entity22 still controls the country 's security ministries and all decisions go through him			2
they also say that the hundreds of people seized by the government in october for backing terrorism and supporting the banned @entity56 are @entity11 supporters			2
iraqiya spokesman @entity58 said the bloc has always warned about power - sharing and deal 's risks that @entity22 's @entity63 has been violating the law			1
" @entity11 has always expressed its rejection to the policy of exclusion and marginalization , lack of power sharing , politicization of the judiciary , the lack of balance within the government institutions , " @entity58 said			1
@entity22 is asking lawmakers to withdraw confidence from his deputy after @entity79 made controversial comments this week over @entity4 forces withdrawing from @entity14 , state media reported late saturday			2
in a @entity1 interview , @entity79 had accused @entity22 of amassing dictatorial power			2
" there will be a day whereby the @entity4 will realize that they were deceived by @entity22 ... and they will regret that , " said @entity79 , a leader within the @entity11 movement			2
also at issue were reports that an arrest warrant had been issued for vice president @entity90 for masterminding a recent car bombing targeting @entity22 and the parliament			0
@entity93 , @entity22 's media adviser , said there were confessions that linked the @entity15 vice president to the bombing			1
@entity98 dismissed the notion that linking @entity90 to terrorism was politically motivated			0
he would not confirm whether an arrest warrant had indeed been issued , saying that was a matter for the judiciary			0
but tensions were running high after the @entity11 bloc , headed by former prime minister @entity106 , made its move friday night			1
there had been fears of renewed bloodshed between @entity14 's majority @entity23 and minority @entity15 populations and that prompted @entity4 officials to work out a power - sharing agreement , bringing the @entity11 movement into the government			1
@entity119 told @entity1 that @entity120 is leaving @entity14 " with a dictator " who has ignored the power - sharing agreement , kept control of the country 's security forces and rounded up hundreds of people in recent weeks			1
he said he was " shocked " to hear @entity4 president @entity128 greet @entity22 at the @entity129 on monday as " the elected leader of a sovereign , self - reliant and democratic @entity14			1
" " @entity4 left @entity14 with almost no infrastructure			0
the political process is going in a very wrong direction , going toward a dictatorship , " he said			0
" people are not going to accept that , and most likely they are going to ask for the division of the country			0
and this is going to be a disaster			0
dividing the country is n't going to be smooth , because dividing the country is going to be a war before that and a war after that			0
" neighboring @entity145 , predominantly @entity23 and led by a @entity23 regime , views @entity22 as its man in @entity0 and has dictated the shape of the current government , @entity79 said			1
but he said @entity22 is playing games with both @entity120 and @entity152			0
@entity153 , a @entity154 member of parliament , said lawmakers discussed the @entity11 move on saturday and said it reflects " a level of mistrust between the blocs , the government , @entity11 and others			2
" the problem is that @entity22 is n't sharing any security decisions with @entity11 , he does n't trust them and this is a big problem , " he said			1
" power - sharing was never power - sharing			1
we are in a government of conflict			0
power - sharing was never successful			1
" the @entity43 do n't want to take sides , we want them ( @entity11 and @entity172 ) to get together to solve their problems			0
" he is worried that the problem could morph into fighting between @entity15 and @entity23 or violence against the government			2
" this is n't just political , " he said			0

the largely @entity15 and secular @entity11 bloc is boycotting parliament
it could unravel @entity14 's fragile power - sharing government
*critics* of @entity23 prime minister @entity22 say is amassing power
the political chaos raises fears of sectarian strife
