@entity0 , @entity1 -- after weeks of demonstrations in the state capital , @entity1 @entity3 cleared a final hurdle to a controversial proposal on thursday after the state 's @entity8 passed an amended version of a bill that would curtail the bargaining rights of most state workers			1
the vote was 53 - 42 in favor of the bill			0
" i applaud all members of the @entity8 for showing up , debating the legislation and participating in democracy , " gov. @entity17 said in a written statement			0
state senate republicans had approved the amended version wednesday night , despite the absence of 14 @entity26 senators who fled the state to prevent a necessary quorum of 20 votes			1
the amended bill stripped the spending components out of the original proposal , enabling lawmakers to pass the measure with fewer votes			1
cries of " @entity37 ! " filled the @entity39 building following thursday 's vote			0
the bill will soon be delivered to @entity17 's desk , who is expected to sign the bill into law			1
meanwhile , at least one @entity47 @entity46 said he has returned to his home state after spending weeks in @entity49 in an effort to prevent the bill 's passage			1
sen. @entity53 said the remaining 13 absentee @entity54 will be returning individually between thursday and saturday			1
but @entity55 sen. @entity55 quickly disputed that assertion , claiming absentee lawmakers have remained in @entity49			2
she added that she did not know where @entity53 was			2
the weeks - long standoff reached a fever pitch thursday after a spokesman for @entity62 senate majority leader @entity62 said the leader received two death threats , which detailed the ways in which the writer claimed @entity62 would be killed			1
both threats were e-mailed from the same address , said the majority leader 's spokesman , @entity69			1
meanwhile , throngs of protesters demonstrated outside the @entity39 building , which police had earlier closed , forcibly removing those inside who refused to leave			0
the police later reopened one entrance			0
" these arrogant actions are what i had a nightmare about last night , " said assembly minority leader @entity79 , a @entity46 , who called the lockout an " outrage			2
" the @entity8 had convened thursday afternoon to vote on the revised measure , which was left only with provisions taking away collective bargaining powers and increasing health insurance and pension fund contributions			0
placard - wielding demonstrators had blocked the building 's entrances , chanting " let us in ! " as police struggled to keep order			0
but shortly before noon , lawmakers were able to access the building through the one open entrance			0
the governor has defended the proposal as an integral measure that allows @entity1 to avoid property tax hikes and public employee layoffs in an effort to balance the budget			2
" it 's about giving local government the tools they need to make reforms , " he told reporters , saying it 's part of an effort to address the state 's impending $ 3.6 billion deficit			2
while the proposal has a fiscal impact , he said , the new version of the bill does not have an appropriations component -- something that allowed @entity47 @entity3 to approve the measure , despite the absence of @entity26 senators			1
fourteen @entity26 senators fled the state in mid-february to prevent the 20 votes necessary for a quorum on spending bills			1
" the dirty trick is what those @entity54 have played for the last three weeks , " @entity17 said to critics ' claims that the @entity47 had pulled a fast one			2
@entity47 @entity54 have called the bill an attack on the negotiating rights of state employees			1
@entity137 filed a complaint with the @entity140 district attorney 's office , claiming wednesday night 's committee hearing on the collective bargaining bill violated @entity1 's @entity143			1
" the state @entity47 and the @entity8 violated @entity1 's very strict @entity143 , by failing to give proper notice of their intended activities , " said @entity144 , an attorney for a teachers ' union called @entity146			1
" when you act in violation of the law to pass a bill , the bill itself is void			0
" nearly 200 protesters refused to leave the @entity39 after the @entity47 vote , sleeping on the floor of the rotunda and in front of the @entity8 doors			0
@entity39 police had initially allowed the protesters to stay despite a court order that prohibits people from remaining inside the building at night			0
" the @entity54 have had three weeks to debate this bill and were offered repeated opportunities to come home , which they refused , " @entity17 said in an earlier statement on the vote			1
" in order to move the state forward , i applaud the @entity176 's action today to stand up to the status quo and take a step in the right direction to balance the budget and reform government			2
" but the move drew howls of outrage from outside the chamber , where pro-union demonstrators again chanted " shame " and " you lied to @entity1 " as the bill passed			1
thousands more began to converge on the building , and a chorus of horns from passing cars echoed in the streets around the @entity39 after the vote			0
@entity197 , executive director of the @entity198 , said officers with the @entity0 police department and @entity140 sheriff 's deputies had been placed on alert ahead of thursday 's protests			0
@entity17 and @entity205 lawmakers are trying to close a $ 137 million budget shortfall with a plan that calls for curbs on public employee union bargaining rights and requires public workers , with the exception of police and firefighters , to cover more of their retirement plans and health care premiums			2
public employee unions agreed to financial concessions that they say will help meet the state 's fiscal needs , but @entity17 has said the limits on public bargaining are a critical component of his plan			2
raises would be capped to the rate of inflation , unless state voters approve			0
the legislation also would require unions to hold a new certification vote every year , and unions would no longer be allowed to collect dues from workers ' paychecks			0
unions mobilized their supporters to oppose the bill , drawing tens of thousands of workers to rallies opposing @entity17 and supporting the fugitive @entity54			1
@entity240 , president of the state @entity241 , said wednesday night 's maneuver " shows that @entity17 and the @entity3 have been lying throughout this entire process			2
" " none of the provisions that attacked workers ' rights had anything to do with the budget , " @entity240 said			0
but the @entity251 praised the developments , saying @entity17 was " holding strong " to his principles			0
" under tremendous pressure from union bosses , who have become irrelevant other than in their unquenchable thirst for power , gov. @entity17 held fast and did what was best for the people of @entity1 , " a statement from the political action committee said			0
the vote in the @entity47 on the amended measure was 18 - 1 , with @entity205 state sen. @entity265 -- who earlier had floated a compromise that neither side bought into -- the lone opponent			1
sen. @entity269 , the @entity26 @entity47 leader , said @entity3 " conspired to take government away from the people			1
" " in 30 minutes , 18 state senators undid 50 years of civil rights in @entity1 , " @entity269 said in a statement condemning the vote			1
" their disrespect for the people of @entity1 and their rights is an outrage that will never be forgotten			0
" @entity2 's @entity279 contributed to this report			0
