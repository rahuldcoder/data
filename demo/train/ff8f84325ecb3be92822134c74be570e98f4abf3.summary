@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 has not altered its search engine in @entity1 despite a court order to do so because the company has not yet received an official order from the court , a spokeswoman said thursday			1
until @entity4 is served with the injunction , the company will not remove any search results from its search engine or comment on the matter , @entity10 told @entity2			1
an @entity1 court this week granted an injunction that blocks the internet giant from " suggesting " searches that lead to certain sites that have been deemed anti-semitic , and removes the sites from the search engine 's index			1
the injunction , filed by @entity24 , an umbrella organization of @entity1 's @entity26 community , also prohibits @entity4 from advertising on the stated websites			1
the injunction names 76 sites that the organization considers " highly discriminatory			1
" @entity4 's suggested searches are a @entity4 algorithm that offers search terms similar to the one the user appears to be typing in			1
" the common denominator on these sites is the incitement of hate and the call to violence , " @entity24 said in a statement			0
" in none of these cases are there discussions or criticisms from the academic , technological , political or philosophical perspectives			0
" " it 's a slippery slope			0
i do n't think that the people of @entity1 are harmed by the inability to see anti-semitic content , but i think that the best answer is counter-speech , " said @entity50 , a researcher at the @entity51			2
he noted that @entity4 , faced with anti-semitic search results in the @entity57 , responded by posting an ad with a link to a statement that includes a link to information from the @entity63			1
" if you recently used @entity4 to search for the word ' @entity26 , ' you may have seen results that were very disturbing			1
we assure you that the views expressed by the sites in your results are not in any way endorsed by @entity4 , " @entity4 's policy statement says			1
it goes on to note that citizens and organizations have urged the company to remove links or adjust search results			2
" although @entity4 reserves the right to address such requests individually , @entity4 views the comprehensiveness of our search results as an extremely important priority , " the statement says			1
" accordingly , we do not remove a page from our search results simply because its content is unpopular or because we receive complaints concerning it			2
" @entity1 has the largest @entity26 population in @entity88			1
the jewish community there numbers more than 250,000 , with the majority residing in the capital , @entity0			0
the court ruling on the injunction notes that restrictions on freedom of speech and censorship are illegal under the @entity1 constitution , but also notes that the constitution protects people from discrimination			0
as such , the judge cited previous cases in @entity1 that establish that in some restricted cases , it is permissible to prevent the diffusion of certain publications if they infringe on someone 's personal rights			0
judge @entity112 concluded that " the terms mentioned ( in the lawsuit ) as well as the results obtained through ' suggested searches ' could be described as discriminatory acts and / or at least , incitement and / or encouragement for discrimination			1
" according to @entity24 , the suggested search complaint focused on 13 terms that led to websites that are anti-semitic , some of which deny that the @entity126 took place			2
the group did not disclose the 13 terms in question , nor the names of the websites that were blocked			0
in a statement , the group said that by suggesting these websites , @entity4 is " inducing and directing traffic to sites with offensive and illegal content			1
" in @entity1 , there have been previous cases in which individuals have sued to have certain websites removed from @entity4 's index , citing invasion of privacy , said @entity146 , research director for the @entity147 at @entity148			1
the court actions in @entity1 appear to view @entity4 more as a publisher of information than as an intermediary , he said			2
" it seems to reflect a misunderstanding of how the @entity155 works and how search engines work , " he said			0
@entity157 , director of the @entity158 at the @entity160 - based @entity159 , said the @entity1 court 's move was part of a " problematic trend " on the part of many governments			0
" at the end of the day , enlisting companies to become greater gatekeepers on content online really does shrink the range of speech that we can access			0
... it 's dangerous to try to shut down speech , because you do n't get that kind of robust public debate about what should or should not be acceptable in a democratic society , " she said			0
while restrictions on the @entity155 are usually associated with countries such as @entity185 or @entity186 , it is not uncommon for other nations to try to impose some limits on it			0
@entity191 , for example , asked @entity4 to remove @entity193 videos that showed the @entity191 king , @entity194 , with feet near his head			2
in @entity191 culture , it 's considered extremely offensive for anyone 's feet to be near someone 's head			0
a national law bans such representations , and @entity4 agreed not to show such videos within @entity191 , although they are still available elsewhere in the world			2
@entity205 bans neo-nazi content , and @entity4 has agreed to remove such sites from its @entity209 search engine in that country			2
@entity211 , meanwhile , blocks @entity193 because the company refused to take down all potentially offensive videos about @entity214 , the @entity211 political hero			0
@entity2 's @entity215 and @entity216 contributed to this report .			0
