@entity0 -- when @entity4 sen. @entity3 of @entity5 and rep. @entity6 of @entity7 unveiled their bill monday to regulate the online and mail - order sale of ammunition , they did so in a state most friendly to @entity13 -- @entity7			1
but across the country , voters might not be as receptive			0
gun control can be seen as political quicksand for @entity4 lawmakers			2
@entity3 and @entity6 , whose husband was killed and son was injured in a 1993 mass shooting on the @entity22 , said their bill will help crack down on people anonymously stockpiling ammunition bought through the @entity26			0
@entity28 police said the alleged shooter in @entity30 this month purchased thousands of rounds of ammunition online			2
still , when it comes to gun policy , many congressional democrats have " decided to keep quiet and not go there , " said @entity32 , dean and professor at the @entity34 at @entity36 's @entity35			1
they remember the 1990s , when president @entity42 was able to push through @entity43 an assault weapons ban and a required waiting period before purchasing handguns			1
but that move led to a fractious debate over gun policy that , following the columbine shootings in 1999 , ultimately helped sink vice president @entity52 's chances of winning the 2000 election , in part because of problems persuading white , rural and blue collar voters to pick him , @entity32 said			1
" you can push ( gun control ) through , then bam , @entity52 loses , " @entity32 said			2
" politically , i think that was a big mistake for ( @entity42 )			1
he got it through , and his constituency was happy with him			0
but it had consequences ... it kills you down the line			0
" chastened congressional @entity13 , especially those in competitive districts and their leaders , have since given the issue of gun policy wide berth			1
even president @entity73 steered clear of gun rights in his speech in the aftermath of the 2009 @entity78 shooting and last year after six people were killed during an assassination attempt on rep. @entity81 , @entity82 , in @entity83			1
@entity73 mentioned gun safety only in passing after the @entity83 shootings to describe the polarizing nature of the issue			1
@entity89 and @entity90 leaders are judiciously sidestepping the issue , even after @entity73 brought it up during his recent remarks on the movie theater shootings			2
" with the schedule we have , we 're not going to get into the debate on gun control , " senate majority leader @entity94 , @entity95 , told @entity1			1
" but i 'm very happy , i 'm glad the president made the statement because it 's something that needs to be done			0
but we 're not going to address gun control			2
" it would be politically unwise to do so , political experts say , especially during a fierce battle for control of the @entity90			0
with 51 seats , @entity13 hold a narrow majority			1
@entity90 @entity108 have 47 seats and independents -- @entity111 and @entity112 -- tend to vote with @entity13			1
party leaders on both sides are watching close @entity90 races in @entity116 and @entity117			2
democrats are facing tough re-election contests in @entity120 and @entity121 , and there are two open @entity90 races @entity124 and @entity125			2
three of those states -- @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity125 -- also rank among the highest for the number of background checks for guns , according to a 2010 analysis by the @entity131			0
the report compared 18 months worth of data from the @entity135 's @entity134 and compared that with state 's population data from the @entity139 's 2009 estimates to gain a glimpse at the states that are " the most armed			0
" according to the analysis , the 10 states with the highest number of background checks for guns voted for @entity146 @entity82 sen. @entity146 in the 2008 presidential election			2
the 10 states with the least number of checks voted for @entity73			0
" you can have a guy who plays well in @entity125 , but if the @entity108 paint him as somebody that ... allows liberals on @entity154 to take away your gun rights ... ( he could run into problems ) , " @entity32 said			1
" so the leadership has to say ' we 're not playing that kind of game '			0
" talking about gun policy in those states could alienate the types of voters who are motivated to cast ballots based on a single issue			1
those who fight hardest for gun ownership tend to be very vocal , single - issue voters , said @entity169 , an associate professor and co-director at @entity171 , while those who favor stricter control tend to have a range of issues they 're pushing			1
" the questions for @entity13 is whether support for gun violence prevention would truly harm their support among people who might not have voted for them anyway , " @entity169 said			1
there 's also little political incentive for those in tough congressional races to talk about gun policy since several national polls suggest voters are against stricter gun laws , and there 's actually been a downturn both in the number of people owning guns overall and gun violence , said @entity195 , an associate professor of public policy and political science at @entity198 and author of " disarmed : the @entity200 for @entity201 in @entity202			1
" for example , a @entity204 poll conducted in april , found that 55 % of independent voters feel it is " more important to protect gun ownership than to control guns , " with 40 % saying controlling gun ownership is more important			1
the poll also found that 72 % of @entity108 feel protecting gun ownership is important , while 27 % of @entity13 feel that way			1
those who advocate stricter gun control lost the messaging battle long ago , @entity195 said			0
" historically the pro-control side has struggled to come up with a compelling narrative that will help people come over to the case of stricter gun control laws , " @entity195 said			0
" for a long time , these gun violence rates and massacres spoke for themselves			0
they relied on that to make the case but were up against a very powerful and very well - disciplined and skillful army that was good at taking those arguments apart			0
" they are also skilled at how they target their campaign contributions			0
for example , during the 2010 midterm elections , fiscally moderate @entity230 in tough re-election fights represented roughly half of the top 20 recipients of contributions from the @entity237 , according to data collected by the campaign - finance website @entity240			2
the candidates -- many of whom hail from rural regions in @entity246 and @entity247 states where gun ownership is deeply cherished -- each received nearly $ 10,000 from the @entity237 that year			1
in 2008 , only one @entity250 made the top 20 list , @entity253 democrat @entity252 , who netted an @entity237 endorsement and contested the constitutionality of the @entity0 's gun ban in a @entity258 brief			1
this year so far , only three @entity13 made the top 20 list and received donations of roughly $ 5,000			2
all three either lost primaries or retired , out of the running for the fall election			0
still , in @entity7 , @entity3 and @entity6 know the political reality , but they see their fight as bigger than politics			0
" it 's one thing to buy a pair of shoes online , " @entity3 told reporters monday			0
" but it should take more than a click of the mouse to amass thousands of rounds of ammunition			0
" @entity1 's @entity276 contributed to this report			0

@entity42 aims to curb online ammo sales , though election losses make @entity13 *hesitant*
high stakes races make it unlikely for @entity13 to wade into gun policy debate
gun ownership advocates in competitive states are vocal and will vote on a single issue
the @entity237 tends to support @entity13 who vocally fight for gun rights
