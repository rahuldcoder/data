@entity0 may be a place to practice how to respond to a disaster , but that does n't mean real danger is nonexistent			1
when we headed over to see its mock subway station , complete with eight cars donated from @entity11 's @entity10 system , we were told we had a limited window to view it			2
the reason -- they were going to be pumping actual toxic gas into the building to simulate a chemical attack			2
as smoke rose from chunks of concrete representing an obliterated building , @entity18 put it this way : " as soon as you come in here , the pretend goes away			2
" he 's a fire and rescue battalion chief with @entity27 , @entity28 , and his words carry a lot of weight			0
his elite team of urban search and rescue operatives has been deployed to numerous disasters , including @entity35 , the 2011 @entity37 earthquake and tsunami , and the 2010 @entity40 quake			0
@entity41 , a two - decades - plus veteran of disaster response , agreed the @entity43 , @entity44 , facility passes muster			1
" the temperature extremes , the building extremes , the noises , the environment , are incredibly lifelike , " said @entity41 , @entity46 chief of staff and.a spokesman for the @entity49			0
the brotherhood of @entity55 from the aforementioned subway station , to a mock bridge with crushed cars , to a devastated structure made to look like the aftermath of the @entity63 bombing , @entity0 ' 830 - acre site is designed to allow a variety of responders to do a variety of drills in one location			1
this kind of " doomsday @entity70 " owes its vision to @entity73 , a telecommunications executive who was in @entity74 in the aftermath of @entity76			0
during @entity76 , he saw " what was being done there , and what was not being done			0
" from there the idea was born , and a former @entity83 missile plant became the location			0
the subway station is especially convincing , fashioned from an elongated building originally designed to be an assembly line for the weapons			0
open for less than two years , the @entity0 facility has changed the game for disaster response training			1
clients can tell @entity73 's team what their specific needs are			1
if it 's a group from the @entity97 , they can request the ground be saturated to simulate the region 's heavy rainfall			0
many agencies have " script writers " that work with @entity0 on specifications , from smoke to rebar			1
" we 're primarily just a tool , and we want to be the best tool , " @entity73 said			0
he does n't want to slight government training facilities but points out the advantages to being privately run			1
" we can adapt and provide everything the client needs almost on demand , " he said			1
and by being able to provide a number of different training types in one place , @entity73 says , he 's saving the taxpayers money			2
still , the process to create such scenarios takes time			2
a recent weeklong earthquake response drill for @entity49 and the @entity121 took months to plan , according to spokespeople			2
and things must always be changed up			0
a pair of dog handlers from a @entity127 search and rescue team pointed out that the animals are smart enough to remember where the holes in the rubble are			0
as for @entity73 , he hopes his vision will extend well beyond the rolling hills of central @entity44			1
" if we can make this entire campus successful , we would like to put one of these in ( each of ) the four corners of the @entity140 , " he said .			1

@entity0 is an 830 - acre disaster response training facility in @entity44
privately run center prides itself on realistic training scenarios " on demand "
clients work with the @entity0 to develop *customized* scenarios for training
the @entity0 *founder* hopes to expand to other parts of the @entity140
