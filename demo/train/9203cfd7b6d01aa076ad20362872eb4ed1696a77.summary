elevated hopes that @entity1 might soon be found were tempered friday , when the joint search agency said the latest signal probably is n't from the missing plane			1
the most recent acoustic signal detected by an @entity6 aircraft in the search thursday is " unlikely to be related to the aircraft black boxes , " @entity6 chief search coordinator @entity5 said in a statement friday			1
" on the information i have available to me , there has been no major breakthrough in the search for @entity1 , " @entity5 said			1
" further analysis continues to be undertaken by @entity17			0
" but @entity6 prime minister @entity18 told reporters in @entity20 on friday that authorities are " very confident " the signals picked up by acoustic detectors are coming from the black box of missing @entity1 , @entity26 affiliate @entity25 reported			1
it 's unclear whether @entity18 was referring to four signals detected earlier this week			1
as planes and boats scoured the @entity35 for more signals and signs of wreckage , a senior @entity30 government official and another source involved in the investigation divulged details about the flight to @entity26 on thursday , including new information about what radar detected , the last words from the cockpit and how high the plane was flying after it went off the grid			2
@entity1 disappeared from military radar for about 120 nautical miles after it crossed back over the @entity49 , sources say			0
based on available data , this means the plane must have dipped in altitude to between 4,000 and 5,000 feet , a senior @entity30 government official and a source involved in the investigation tell @entity26			2
the dip could have been programmed into the computers controlling the plane as an emergency maneuver , said aviation expert @entity59			2
" the real issue here is it looks like -- more and more -- somebody in the cockpit was directing this plane and directing it away from land , " said @entity26 aviation analyst and former @entity62 managing director @entity61			2
" and it looks as though they were doing it to avoid any kind of detection			0
" but former @entity74 @entity76 inspector general @entity75 was not convinced			0
she said the reported dip could have occurred in response to a loss of pressure , to reach a level where pressurization was not needed and those aboard the plane would have been able to breathe without oxygen , or to get out of the way of commercial traffic , which typically flies at higher altitudes			2
that would have been necessary had the plane 's transponder been turned off and it lost communications			1
" if you do n't have any communications , you need to get out of other traffic , " @entity75 said			0
" we still do n't have any motive and any evidence of a crime yet , " she said , adding that most radar can track planes at altitudes below 4,000 feet , so the plane 's descent may not have indicated any attempt by whoever was controlling it to hide			1
she held out hope that the black boxes hold the answers and that they will be found soon			1
new flight details revealed @entity30 sources told @entity26 that flight 370 's pilot , capt. @entity112 , was the last person on the jet to speak to air - traffic controllers , telling them " good night , @entity30 three - seven - zero			2
" the sources said there was nothing unusual about his voice , which betrayed no indication that he was under stress			0
one of the sources , an official involved in the investigation , told @entity26 that police played the recording to five other @entity127 pilots who knew the pilot and copilot			0
" there were no third - party voices , " the source said			0
the sources also told @entity26 that @entity30 air force search aircraft were scrambled about 8 a.m. march 8 to the @entity134 and the @entity135 , soon after @entity127 reported that its plane was missing			1
the aircraft took off before authorities corroborated data indicating that the plane turned back westward , a senior @entity30 government official told @entity26			2
but the air force did not inform the @entity145 or search and rescue operations until three days later , march 11 , a source involved in the investigation told @entity26			2
later thursday , communications officials from @entity30 's @entity148 denied that jets had scrambled shortly after the plane went missing , calling that claim a " false allegation			1
" possible signal raises hope the possible signal heard by a search plane was picked up through sonar buoys equipped to receive such electronic data and was detected near the @entity6 ship @entity158 , said the @entity159			1
the @entity161 source said the signal detected was not at the 37.5 khz frequency consistent with the pingers from flight data recorders but in a range that suggests strongly that it is from something that is man - made			2
commodore @entity169 of the @entity170 said wednesday in @entity171 that existing technology in @entity174 aircraft had been modified to allow the acoustic processor to pick up sounds in the frequency range			0
using the technology in this way is experimental , according to the source			0
the source said four @entity181 have been modified with this technology , with the sonar buoys expiring and sinking about eight hours after they are deployed from the aircraft			0
on wednesday , @entity169 said that each @entity174 is capable of deploying 84 buoys , laid in a pattern or grid coordinated with the @entity158			0
although @entity169 said the buoys have sensors that can detect signals " at least " 1,000 feet below the surface , the source is confident that the technology has been tested at a " much deeper depth			0
" crews have been narrowing the search area in the @entity35			1
imagining the search underwater search areas shrinks up to 12 military aircraft , three civil aircraft and 13 ships were assigned to assist in friday 's search for the @entity201 , which was carrying 239 people when it vanished march 8 on a fight from @entity204 , @entity30 , to @entity205			1
there were no sightings reported by search aircraft or objects recovered by ships on thursday , the @entity159 said			2
friday 's search area was about 18,000 square miles ( 46,700 square kilometers ) , centered 1,436 miles ( 2,312 kilometers ) northwest of @entity171			1
that 's far smaller than the search area 's size a few weeks ago			1
" it 's pretty incredible , if you look at where we started , which was virtually the entire @entity35 , now getting it down to what 's essentially a couple hundred square miles ( where the pings have been detected ) is pretty miraculous , " @entity215 said			2
the @entity158 first picked up two sets of underwater pulses on saturday that were of a frequency close to that used by the locator beacons			0
it heard nothing more until tuesday , when it reacquired the signals twice			0
the four signals were within 17 miles of one another			0
" i believe we are searching in the right area , but we need to visually identify wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of @entity1 , " @entity5 said wednesday			0
as the search continues , a @entity240 supply ship will help provide supplies and fuel to the ships that are looking for the missing plane			1
the @entity246 will help supply @entity6 naval ships involved in the search " in the coming days , " the @entity170 said in a statement			1
that 's likely a sign that search teams are preparing for a lengthy hunt , analysts said			1
tracking pings is only one early step in the hunt to find the plane 's data records , wreckage and the 239 people aboard			1
" i think they 're getting ready for the long haul , " @entity61 said			0
" even if they do get four or five more pings , once they drop the side - scanning sonar device down , that is going to be painstaking and long			0
so i think they are settling in for the long search			0
" friday is day 35 in the search			1
time is of the essence : the batteries powering the flight recorders ' locator beacons are certified to emit high - pitched signals for only 30 days after they get wet			0
" the signals are getting weaker , " @entity5 said wednesday , " which means we 're either moving away from the search area or the pinger batteries are dying			1
" as the focus narrows , more questions emerge in search for @entity30 370 the hunt for a flight 370 ping : how they are doing it how deep is deep ? imagining the @entity1 search underwater			0

search agency : the fifth signal is unlikely to be from the black boxes
" there has been no major breakthrough , " the head of the agency says
friday 's search is focused on a smaller area
a @entity240 supply ship is joining the search for the missing plane
