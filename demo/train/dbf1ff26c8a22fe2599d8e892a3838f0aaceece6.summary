@entity0 , @entity1 -- the baseball field looks like any other where people flock to play pickup games in @entity1 on the weekends			1
a few blocks from the blindingly turquoise ocean , players hustle to close out innings in between slugs of @entity15 beer			0
but this game was different from any other being played			0
it 's not just that legends of the @entity1 leagues arrived throughout the morning to play on this dusty field on the outskirts of @entity0			2
no one in the small crowd that formed even looked at them			0
instead , all eyes are on the player who should not be there : @entity29			2
a star pitcher in @entity1 , @entity29 was part of a team that won @entity33 , was named the @entity1 athlete of the year three times and , in the 1999 game between @entity1 's national team and the @entity38 , pitched eight shutout innings			1
@entity43 , himself once an avid pelotero , nicknamed @entity29 the " @entity41			2
" in 2002 , he defected while playing in @entity44			2
after years of barely scraping out a living playing in @entity1 , @entity29 was signed by the @entity46 for $ 32 million			1
sports stars who left @entity1 for mega-salaries abroad were considered traitors by @entity1 's government			1
if they abandoned the island for the lure of playing in the majors , they could be barred from their homeland , never to see friends and family again			0
that was until january , when authorities instituted long - hoped - for reforms , lifting many of the restrictions on @entity1 who wanted to travel abroad and return to the island			1
sports stars and government officials will still need special permission to leave			2
but for the first time , high - level defectors like @entity29 are allowed to come back			2
he is the first sports star to test the new law			1
" already , in the plane , i was crying			0
this is something big that i had waited 10 years for , " @entity29 told @entity2 as @entity1 fans lined up to snap photos with him on cell phone cameras			1
" it 's years of pain that ca n't be erased , but i always had the hope that some day , " he said			2
while other sports stars who left @entity1 said they were uneasy about returning -- afraid they could still be banned or might even be imprisoned -- @entity29 could n't wait			1
his mother was ill in a hospital , and he said he had been homesick every day he was away			0
other @entity1 players who had defected , like @entity84 " @entity85 " @entity83 , complained that @entity1 who live abroad still needed to ask the government for a visa to return			1
but @entity29 said it was an important sign that the door had finally been opened to allow defectors to come back			2
" they should n't be afraid , and ( sports stars who defected ) will keep continuing to return , " he said			1
" it 's the dream of anyone who lives outside @entity1 , to be able to return and be with your family and the fans here			1
" and there is no shortage of hometown pride for @entity29			0
while @entity1 's government may disavow sports stars who leave to pursue careers in the @entity104 , many @entity1 quietly root for countrymen who achieve success abroad			1
throughout the pickup baseball game , players wandered off the field to embrace @entity29 , some with tears in their eyes			0
" i am really happy to have him back and to see each other again and remember things we did together , " @entity1 pitcher @entity113 said			1
" thank @entity117 he can come back now when he wants			0
we will be seeing each other a lot more now			0
" @entity29 said he would stay in @entity1 a little while longer			1
his mother 's health has improved , and she is out of the hospital			0
he also wanted to return to the small countryside town where he grew up and was discovered by a baseball scout while working in the fields			0
then he would go back to the @entity104 and continue training with the hopes of playing professional baseball again			0
injuries sidelined @entity29 after he played with the @entity46 , @entity131 and @entity132 , but he said he was sure he still had a few more seasons in the majors			1
he said he would take the smells , sounds and memories of @entity1 back with him			0
" every time i can , i will be here , " he said			0
" this is my country			0

in 2002 , @entity1 pitcher @entity29 defected , signed with @entity46 for $ 32 million
he ran the risk of never seeing @entity1 again , as the government considered him a traitor
but @entity1 is lifting some restrictions on those who want to travel abroad and return
@entity29 , the first sports star to test the new law , returns for a visit after " years of pain "
