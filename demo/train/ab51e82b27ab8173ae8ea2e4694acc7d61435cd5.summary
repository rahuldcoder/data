-- as the @entity2 weighs possible military strikes on @entity4 in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack , it has to consider a critical question : then what ? a broad cross-section of experts on the region agree : a missile strike could worsen the war in @entity4 and usher in a host of new problems			1
" the key issue is not the tactics of the strikes , but the strategic aftermath , " says @entity19 , a former @entity20 official now with the @entity21			0
read the @entity2 government 's assessment of @entity4 most experts believe a strike would target the @entity4 regime 's weapons arsenal -- not suspected sites of chemical weapons stockpiles			1
the latter would be " the worst possible option , " and could spread chemicals downwind , says @entity34 , a former commander of the @entity37 military 's chemical defense regiment			0
@entity2 officials have said strikes on command bunkers , airfields or the artillery batteries and rocket launchers used to fire chemical projectiles are among the possibilities being considered			0
@entity0 asked analysts to discuss what could follow			1
@entity49 , extremists emboldened ? " a limited attack could suppress morale among regime forces and encourage defections and splits , " says @entity50 of the @entity51			1
the opposition would be emboldened -- including the @entity49 - linked @entity59 , analysts say			1
" supporting the opposition at this point would be like @entity64 - kissing @entity49 , " says @entity60 , a former @entity20 official now with the @entity61			1
" if the opposition wins , @entity49 will win power			1
" " there is a real risk that destabilizing the @entity70 regime could enable the jihadist and @entity49 - affiliated rebel groups , " agrees @entity73 , author of the policy analysis " arms and influence in @entity4 : the @entity77			1
" " these groups are militarily more capable than the rebels currently receiving @entity2 support			0
" it would be difficult for the @entity2 to target @entity59 infrastructure as part of a missile strike campaign because @entity59 does not operate with clear " command - and - control assets " like the regime of @entity4 president @entity70 , @entity73 says			1
what do @entity4 's neighbors think of potential @entity90 strikes ? @entity4 steps up attacks ? many analysts believe a @entity2 attack would be aimed largely at making a statement that using chemical weapons in the @entity4 civil war is unacceptable -- and that president @entity97 is serious about his " red line			1
" the attack would be unlikely to severely damage @entity70 , analysts say			1
but a limited attack brings its own dangers			2
" doing something cosmetic would be worse than doing nothing at all , " says @entity103 , senior naval analyst at the @entity104			2
it would send a message to @entity70 " that he has relative immunity from us , that he can continue to do whatever he wants short of massive chemical attacks on civilians , " @entity103 said in a @entity0 interview			2
some other analysts fear @entity70 would respond with new chemical weapons attacks			1
" damaging his air force and known military installations would force him to consider his more extreme options for regime survival , " including chemical weapons to quell rebellions , says @entity118 of the @entity119			0
" @entity4 is now a fight to the death for both sides			0
" more than 100,000 people have been killed in the @entity4 conflict -- the vast majority through conventional weapons , according to the @entity133			0
rebels officials have said 1,300 people were killed in a recent chemical weapons attack ; the @entity133 has said hundreds , perhaps more than a thousand , were killed			2
' red line ' debate : are chemical weapons worse ? the @entity2 insists @entity4 was behind the attack , but " there is no absolute certainty , " @entity118 notes in a @entity145 column			2
@entity4 insists it has not used chemical weapons , and blames rebels			0
if rebels did carry out the attack " to bait @entity2 into the conflict , then @entity2 firepower would be futile , " says @entity118			2
" no amount of surgical strikes on government facilities will prevent non-state actors from further use of these weapons			0
" bombing raises suspicion of another chemical attack retaliation -- against @entity160 ? it 's unlikely @entity4 would attack @entity2 assets , analysts say			1
" they could try to shoot down @entity2 bombers , if they are used , but have little hope against cruise missiles , " says @entity164 of the @entity165			0
" the regime 's forces are tied down against rebels , and it lacks an air force or missiles that can hit any important @entity2 targets with reliability			0
" and if @entity4 did manage to hit a @entity2 target , " it would only help shift @entity2 opinion toward war and invite greater @entity2 military involvement " -- the last thing the @entity4 regime wants			2
" it 's easier for @entity4 to target @entity160 , but @entity160 's retaliation would bring similarly dire consequences , " @entity164 says			1
" the nightmare scenario is that @entity70 will respond by launching chemical weapons into @entity160 or another neighbor , " says @entity60 , of the @entity61			1
" after all , if he has n't batted an eye at gassing sleeping @entity4 , why worry about killing @entity191 , @entity192 , or @entity193 ? " @entity160 have lined up in recent days for gas masks			1
but a more likely scenario , says @entity164 , is that @entity196 would attack @entity160			1
" the @entity193 - based terrorist militia might fire rockets into @entity160 , as they did in 2006 , in response to an attack on their @entity4 patrons			1
that could draw the @entity2 more deeply into the war			2
on the other hand , the memory of @entity160 's 2006 response might deter @entity196			1
" international ramifications : protests , unrest , attacks ? a missile strike on @entity4 could lead to new violence in other parts of the @entity214 and around the world , says @entity216 , head of @entity214 and @entity217 and forecasting at @entity219			1
in @entity193 , @entity196 supporters would be more likely to attack @entity221 " due to the increased perception that @entity221 communities are supporting @entity90 - @entity160 targeting of @entity196 and @entity4 , " he says			1
in several @entity214 countries , protests could arise -- some of them potentially violent			0
in @entity192 , @entity4 " would likely sponsor groups " to attack malls , hotels , and government targets , @entity216 says			1
and there will be a " high risk " of attacks , sponsored by @entity236 , against @entity90 assets around the world , from @entity239 to @entity240 to @entity241 , @entity216 says			1
@entity242 would also likely take action against companies based in the @entity2 and some other countries , he says			0
who wants what ? @entity4 becomes ' @entity97 's @entity248 ' ? the repercussions for the @entity2 , in the eyes of the world , could be tremendous , analysts say			2
" by intervening , @entity4 may well prove to be @entity97 's war , bequeathed to a new president in 2016			2
the images on our screens will not be @entity4 using chemical weapons to kill each other , but @entity2 bombs creating carnage and killings in yet another @entity266 country , " says @entity257			0
there would be " real and false claims of collateral damage and civilian deaths , " and at the @entity133 , @entity4 would accuse the @entity2 of " illegal aggression , " adds @entity19 of the @entity21			0
" no amount of spin and victory claims can get around these issues			0
nothing can stop critics from validly raising every past @entity2 mistake in past interventions in the region and the world			0
" " the worry here is that the @entity2 could be drawn into even more extensive involvement in @entity4 , " says author @entity73			0
" this could involve a number of things , including imposing a no - fly zone over @entity4 airspace and / or more extensive arming and training of rebels ... this would be a far more resource - intense operation than the 2011 @entity299 operation in @entity300 and would involve greater risks			2
" still , " doing nothing is not an answer , " says @entity19			0
" ... simply standing by and letting @entity4 drift into armed , violent partition will threaten every @entity2 interest in the region			0
" at the least , there should be a new international humanitarian effort , increased support for moderate factions in the opposition and a willingness to say the " @entity2 will consider collective action in terms of some no fly zone or use of airpower to both protect and empower the rebels if they can show they really have moderate leadership , can control the flow of arms and support , and will give full rights and protection to their @entity221 opponents , " he says			2
but in examining the possible repercussions of a missile strike , @entity60 of the @entity61 says , " there is no scenario that will end violence and improve the situation			1
the time for preventive medicine was two years ago			0
" " when one side finally wins , the @entity2 will have to craft a strategy to address a whole new set of problems that such a victory will bring , " he says			0
" let 's call where we are now @entity344 of the @entity4 civil war			0
we have yet to see @entity346 and @entity347 but they are coming			0
" @entity4 crisis : latest developments			0

a missile strike could worsen the war and usher in new problems
" supporting the opposition at this point would be like @entity64 - kissing @entity49 , " analyst says
