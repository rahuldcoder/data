-- q : this week the @entity2 issued preliminary guidelines for ovarian cancer screening			1
it recommends against routine screening saying that the risk of false positive diagnoses outweighs the benefits			0
how can this be and why is it so hard to find a good screening test for ovarian cancer ? a : the @entity14 , @entity13 is a group of medical experts who assess the scientific literature on an issue , such as ovarian cancer screening , before making a recommendation			1
they do influence how doctors practice medicine			0
the statement recommends against routine ovarian cancer screening because they find the evidence of harm associated with screening is greater than the evidence of benefit			1
unfortunately we do not have a good screening test for ovarian cancer , the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women			1
we need something as effective for ovarian cancer screening as pap smears are for cervix cancer screening			1
it is a surprise to many that a screening test could be considered more harmful than helpful			2
the problem is routine ovarian cancer screening starts a cavalcade of medical procedures associated with harms that are greater than the ultimate benefits			1
importantly , it is not that there is no benefit to ovarian cancer screening			1
the problem is there is not a " net benefit			0
" the blood test @entity55 is elevated in about half of women who are known to have ovarian cancer			1
if effectively treated by surgery or chemotherapy , the @entity55 level in the blood goes down			2
it has been used for nearly three decades to follow progress in treatment			0
this test was suggested for screening in the late 1980s			2
screening is doing a test in asymptomatic patients who are not suspected of having the disease but are at risk because of age and gender			2
very early on , many thought @entity55 125 would not work well as a screening test			1
a teacher gave me this example more than 20 years ago and it still holds			0
it is dense in numbers , but i think it is followable			0
it illustrates how a public health physician thinks of a screening test and the trouble with @entity55			1
a group of investigators tested the @entity55 blood test for screening in a group of 915 women average age 55 , and a total of 36 or 3.9 % were abnormal ( a level greater than 35 @entity14 / ml )			1
these women were evaluated for ovarian cancer and followed			1
ultimately none had ovarian cancer			2
what if one was to screen 100,000 women ? that means 3.9 % of the 100,000 or 3,900 women will have false positive findings			0
using @entity103 cancer incidence data , 13 women in the 100,000 would have ovarian cancer in a given year			1
given that most of the 13 women will be diagnosed with incurable advanced ovarian cancer , a fair assumption is six of the 3,900 will be diagnosed with a potentially curable ovarian cancer			1
given that @entity55 is positive in half of ovarian cancer patients , one would reasonably estimate that three of the six women with curable disease would be identified			1
that is three potential cures in the more than 3,900 women screened			0
of the 100,000 women , we expect 148 will die of cancer and nine of the 148 will be die because of ovarian cancer within a year of the screen			1
that might sound worthwhile at face value , but lets look at the harms of screening			0
most of the 3,900 women will get further testing			0
this consists mostly of ultrasounds and cat scans			0
several hundred will need to get laparoscopy or more invasive abdominal surgery for evaluation			0
this is the area of greatest concern			0
one survey shows 14 % of women over the age of 65 have complications after abdominal surgery			0
surgical complications cause death in 1 % to 2 % of women over 65 and one - half of 1 % of women over 50 , several hundred women will get abdominal surgery			2
when done as a routine test it is quite easy to see that ovarian cancer screening could actually cause the death of more women than the number of women saved			1
most of the women who have bad outcomes will not have ovarian cancer			1
the gold standard for proving effectiveness of a screening test is a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing a screened group to a group that is not screened over time			2
the @entity166 began such a study in 1993 and published the result in 2011			0
the trial included 78,216 women aged 55 to 74			0
it randomly assigned 39,105 to screening and 39,111 to usual care			0
after an average of more than 12 years of follow - up , the groups had no difference in the ovarian cancer death rate			2
this means that the trial showed no evidence of routine screening saving lives			0
@entity55 125 is not a good test for ovarian cancer screening , and ovarian cancer may not be a good cancer for screening			1
what we need is a test that flags fewer people who do not have the disease as suspicious of having the disease			1
it would be even better if the test found more than half of the women who have the disease			2
screening also works better in cancers that tend to stay localized for longer periods of time			0
many ovarian cancers spread throughout the abdomen very early in the life of the cancer when the tumor is still very small			2
it is important to note that the task force addressed routine screening			0
the test can be appropriate for screening a woman known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer because of a family history			1
the test may also be appropriate in assessing a woman who has lower abdominal discomforts			0
the opinions expressed in this article do not necessarily represent those of @entity0 , @entity223 , or @entity224 .			0

there **'s** no good screening test for ovarian cancer , the 5th leading cause of cancer deaths in women
a blood test called @entity55 is elevated in about half of women with ovarian cancer , but it **'s** not a good test
dr. @entity239 : we need a test that flags fewer people who do *n't* have the disease as suspicious
