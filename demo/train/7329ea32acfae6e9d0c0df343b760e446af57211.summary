@entity0 -- as the @entity2 negotiated with countries around the world to find new homes for the remaining detainees held at @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity10 's minister of interior had a solution for the four @entity10 citizens left in the prison			1
" you picked them up in @entity21 ; you should drop them off in @entity21 , " @entity14 is quoted as saying , " in the middle of the war zone , " where the detainees could be killed in combat			0
the 2009 cable titled " the interior minister 's remedy for terrorists : let them die , " is among the diplomatic documents posted online by @entity28			1
in it , @entity14 is quoted as expressing concerns about his country 's ability to hold the @entity7 detainees			1
" you know better than i that we can not deal with these people			2
i ca n't detain them , " said @entity14			1
" if i take their passports , they will sue to get them			0
i can talk to you into next week about building a rehabilitation center , but it wo n't happen			0
... they are rotten and the best thing to do is get rid of them			0
" the cable reflects the difficult position the @entity10 government was in regarding the detainees and its problems in " apprehending and detaining terror financiers and facilitators under @entity10 's current legal and political framework			1
" facing pressure to " bring their boys home , " as the cable puts it , @entity10 's inability to keep the suspected terrorists in custody was a difficult and embarrassing issue , as exemplified by the case of @entity67			1
@entity68 , a self - confessed jihadi recruiter and terror financier , had been sentenced to serve three to five years for " ' inciting jihad ' against a friend state			0
" but he was released on bond			0
in a different cable from the @entity75 in @entity76 there is a discussion regarding the recidivism rate of @entity7 detainees returned to @entity80 who then passed through the country 's rehabilitation program			1
of the 119 detainees who went through the program , the cable reports , the overall rate of recidivism was 8 to 10 percent , according to the 2009 cable			1
" the real story of the @entity80 rehabilitation program is one of success : at least 90 percent of its graduates appear to have given up jihad and reintegrated into @entity80 society , " the cable says			1
" the recidivists are the exception , not the rule			0
" the cable does acknowledge however , that it was more difficult to rehabilitate former @entity7 detainees than others			1
in another creative solution for the detainees , @entity80 's @entity104 proposed to implant a @entity108 - like device into former @entity7 detainees to track their movements			1
during a march 22 , 2009 , meeting between @entity2 deputy national security advisor @entity113 and @entity104 , the king suggested an " electronic chip " be implanted in the detainees to allow for tracking their movements as is done with @entity80 horses and falcons			2
according to the cable , @entity113 deflected the idea , saying , " horses do n't have good lawyers , " pointing out that such a proposal would face legal hurdles in the @entity2			2
the relocation of 17 @entity124 detained at @entity7 also was a thorny issue for the @entity2 , according to the @entity28 cables			1
attempts to find new homes for those detainees was met with resistance because of fear of retribution from @entity133			0
at one point , @entity134 considered accepting seven of the @entity124			0
but the government was " subsequently warned by @entity133 of ' a heavy burden on bilateral relations ' " between @entity134 and @entity133 if the @entity134 accepted the detainees			0
according to one cable , @entity141 and foreign policy advisor @entity142 said relocation of the @entity124 " would be ' too difficult , ' but @entity134 could probably accept ' 2 - 3 others ' from @entity7			2
the document also summarized @entity142 as saying , " if @entity134 were to take any [ @entity124 ] , it would be best to do so in combination with other @entity149 countries to prevent @entity133 from focusing its opposition on any one country			0
" in another cable , this one from the @entity75 in @entity153 , @entity154 , the @entity133 ambassador to @entity154 , @entity156 , is quoted as calling @entity2 's refusal to relocate the detainees to @entity133 a " slap in the face			2
" the missive quotes @entity156 as saying , " releasing 17 from @entity7 is an unfriendly act toward us			2
" " he then went on at length about what a ' slap in the face ' it was to @entity133 that the @entity171 detainees were not going to be returned to their homeland but instead shipped to @entity134 , where reportedly they had already been granted refugee status , " the cable says			0
it goes on to say that @entity156 " did imply that the @entity7 situation had made @entity133 look for ways to hit back at the @entity2 " the 17 @entity124 were eventually relocated to @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 .			0

a cable posted on @entity28 quotes a @entity10 official on @entity7 detainees
" we can not deal with these people . i ca n't detain them , " he says
another cable *praises* the @entity80 rehab program for former @entity194 detainees
