can you be pro-life and pro-death penalty ? it 's a question more than one person i know is asking after @entity7 's botched execution of @entity8			1
not necessarily because of the way @entity7 tortuously executed the convicted killer , but because of the hard - core way some reacted to @entity8 's execution			1
the pro-life @entity7 state representative told @entity15 , " i realize this may sound harsh , but as a father and former lawman , i really do n't care if it 's by lethal injection , by the electric chair , firing squad , hanging , the guillotine or being fed to the lions			1
" he also threatened to impeach judges who dared delay executions for any reason			2
this is from a man who is so strongly pro-life he voted for eight bills in four years to prevent women in @entity7 from terminating their pregnancies , or , as many who oppose abortion say , " killing babies			1
so , rep. @entity13 says it 's ok to kill , unless you 're a woman who wants to end her pregnancy ? as i told my friends during a heated debate last weekend , that smacks of hypocrisy			0
the only nonhypocritical viewpoint , i argued , exists in the @entity46			1
@entity46 believe in the " @entity47			1
" as @entity52 's father @entity51 puts it , " we are concerned about a person from womb to tomb			0
" " life is something that comes from @entity55 and should n't be taken away by man , " @entity51 told me			2
put simply , the @entity46 opposes abortion and the death penalty			1
except nothing in life is that simple			2
especially our collective views on the death penalty and abortion			1
if you ask a @entity69 , he or she will likely tell you the @entity46 is wrong			2
" there is no contradiction here , " @entity70 , president of the @entity71 , told me , referring to rep. @entity73 's underlying position			0
@entity73 's words were " careless , " and do n't " reflect any @entity84 ... defense of the death penalty , " he says , but it does not defy logic if @entity73 is pro-life and pro-death penalty			1
" it 's not an eye - for - an - eye kind of thing , " explained @entity70			0
" retribution is not the same as a demand for justice			0
in @entity92 9 , @entity55 speaks to @entity93 after the flood			0
when someone takes human life , they forfeit their own life			2
" so , i asked , " should a woman who 's had an abortion forfeit her own life ? " @entity70 emphatically answered , " no. " @entity8 deserved to die , he said , because the act of murder " was taken in wanton disregard of the life taken and given the nature of the crime , this individual has forfeited his right to live			2
" ( @entity8 not only raped and shot his victim , but ordered his accomplice to bury her alive			0
) do n't get me wrong ; pro-lifers could argue that pro-choice , anti-death penalty believers are inconsistent , too			2
how can you choose to end life , but adamantly oppose the death penalty ? apparently , consistency is not @entity119 's strong suit			1
according to a 2010 study , only about 8 % of @entity119 oppose abortion and the death penalty under all circumstances			1
@entity123 , professor of criminology at the @entity124 , co-authored the study			0
he expected his test results to show a consistent belief system in all kinds of premeditated death			2
in other words , if you believe in the sanctity of life , you would be opposed to euthanasia , the death penalty and abortion			1
turned out , that was not remotely true			0
" from a religious position , the catholic faith is the most consistent life ethic , " @entity123 says			1
" religion is only one factor that affects using the death penalty			1
" the other factor , he says , is politics			0
" when you get people who are against abortion and for the death penalty , that 's not as much a religious effect as a politics effect			1
" @entity155 , professor of criminal justice at the @entity157 , co-authored two studies on attitudes about abortion and capital punishment			0
she was also surprised by the inconsistency many showed toward life issues			2
of those who strongly oppose abortion , yet strongly approve of the death penalty , @entity155 says : " what seems to link those two attitudes together is related to fundamentalism , a literal interpretation of the @entity84 , and an inflexible way of viewing society in general , " @entity155 says			1
" i 'm not sure they really view it as a contradiction			0
there 's a punitive attitude toward this -- kind of like if you do n't want a child , do n't engage in risky sexual behavior ; if you kill someone , you deserve death			0
" and @entity155 says pro-choice , anti-death penalty believers also do n't see a contradiction			0
those who are pro-choice do n't " see abortion as ending a life , " she says			2
" the death penalty becomes completely separate for the pro-choice people , because it 's about a woman 's right to choose			1
" truth told , the " @entity47 , " is relatively new to the @entity46			2
for centuries , the church supported capital punishment			0
but passionate pro-life and death penalty foes , such as sister @entity198 , convinced the church that " helping to kill a defenseless person " in any circumstance is wrong			1
" what 's more innocent than an unborn baby ? " @entity198 told me			0
" it 's easy to be against that			0
" then @entity198 went for the jugular			0
the people who commit terrible crimes , " could you kill them ? if there 's a part of you who ca n't say yes to that , then you ca n't say yes to the death penalty			1
" i must admit i was humbled by @entity198 's question			0
couple that with the fact we can now lock up violent criminals for life and i , again , find myself arguing for the " @entity47			0
" as for @entity70 , the @entity69 leader , he offered me this final thought : " if i had the opportunity to trade the death penalty for the affirmation of protection of the life of the unborn , i 'd take it in a second			1
" let the debate rage on .			0

@entity233 : can you be pro-life and pro-death penalty at the same time ?
she says one @entity7 state representative is ok with executions but strongly pro-life
@entity46 has " consistent ethic of life , " opposing abortion and the death penalty
@entity233 : only a small minority of @entity119 are consistent on the two issues
