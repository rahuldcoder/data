in a victory for same - sex marriage supporters , the @entity0 struck down the @entity3 in a 5 - to - 4 decision			1
the law had denied federal recognition to same - sex couples			1
on the other side of the world , in @entity10 , the fight for gay rights is making progress			1
it is a common clich√© to say that @entity10 is changing			2
news of breakneck economic growth , however , has often overshadowed the country 's " soft " development			0
in the social arena , gays and lesbians , a once shunned minority , have become increasingly more assertive			2
when the @entity26 @entity25 center opened on @entity27 2008 , it did n't make the cover of @entity29 , however , it was a major milestone for the @entity10 gay and lesbian community			1
" we wanted to create an @entity25 friendly space , " said @entity33 , the center 's program director			0
" there were not so many @entity25 organizations in @entity26			0
" @entity33 is one of the many nicknames the 27 year old employs for her protection			0
" in @entity10 advocacy is dangerous , " she said			2
@entity46 's @entity45 approves same - sex marriage since coming to @entity26 from her native @entity48 , @entity33 has thrown herself into the world of professional advocacy			1
earlier this year , she and another female colleague staged a dramatic wedding protest by demanding a legal marriage certificate at @entity26 's @entity55			2
it was the latest in a string of similar protests which have occurred in @entity10 since 2010			2
while the same - sex marriage debate is still too exotic for most @entity10 , there have been successes on other fronts			1
in 1997 , @entity10 abolished the crime of " hooliganism , " largely used as a pretext for criminalizing homosexual and other undesirable behaviors			2
it came a full six years before the @entity0 struck down similar state anti-sodomy laws			0
in 2001 , the @entity69 removed homosexuality from its list of psychiatric disorders and most recently , an update to @entity10 's " @entity74 , " will allow foreign same - sex couples in @entity26 to apply for dependent residence permits as of july 1 , 2013			1
for the next generation of @entity10 urbanites , the wealthiest , worldliest and best educated in history , the laws are of little concern			2
it 's no big deal for @entity83 , a gay 21 - year - old software student at @entity84			1
" i knew when i was in 8th grade , " he said			0
" all of my close friends know			0
" @entity83 , a regular patron of @entity26 's thriving gay nightlife , is still not out to his parents and in many ways his primary concerns are strikingly similar to his @entity92 counterparts			2
" i wo n't let [ my parents ] know before i graduate , " he said			0
" when i have the ability to live on my own , i will probably let them know			0
" @entity97 president signs same - sex marriage bill into law while his university offers no formal resources for @entity25 students , the growth of social media has allowed young people throughout @entity10 to supersede official channels			1
catering to a mostly gay clientele , websites like @entity108 and smartphone applications like @entity110 'd serve as virtual meeting spaces for @entity10 's emerging gay demographic			1
these sites operate openly and without restriction			0
nothing better sums up the transformation than how the @entity10 language itself has adapted			2
today the most common term for gay in @entity10 is " tongzhi , " an ironic rebranding of the old revolutionary word for " comrade			1
" this has largely supplanted the more clinical and negative " tongxinglian			0
" much work remains however			0
a 2013 @entity130 poll found that 57 % of @entity10 's population was against the acceptance of homosexuality and only 21 % in favor			1
" most @entity10 still do n't have consciousness about @entity25 issues , " said @entity33 , who added that older people " think it is something from the @entity137 , or something brought over from @entity140 countries			2
" the @entity25 center itself has often been an unwelcome presence in its upscale neighborhood			0
twice their landlord has tried to evict them which @entity33 speculated was likely the result of community pressure			0
outside of the major cities too , @entity10 's gay and lesbian citizens still face many challenges			1
@entity157 , a 26 - year - old @entity26 entrepreneur is out to everyone he knows in the capital , but back home in his native @entity162 , one of @entity10 's poorest provinces , it is a very different story			1
gay marriage around the world " i would not say it is bad			0
i would say it is hard , " said @entity157 , adding that rural @entity10 " do n't have any knowledge about gays			0
" @entity157 , who like most of his generation is an only child , knows his parents want him to marry and have children			0
the pressure to wed and continue the family line is deeply rooted in @entity10 history			1
one of @entity10 's most influential ancient thinkers , @entity179 ( @entity180 ) , once opined that " of all the ways a son can be disrespectful to his parents , the worst is to have no offspring			1
" family pressure combined with the lingering social stigma has resulted in the phenomenon of " tongqi " or women who unknowingly marry gay men			1
@entity190 , one of @entity10 's most eminent sexologists and sociologists has estimated that there are as many as 16 million such women in @entity10 today			1
" divorce is difficult for women , " said @entity33 , alluding to its cultural taboo			0
she added that stories of depression and even suicide were not uncommon among tongqi once they discovered the truth			0
still , the future for gay and lesbian @entity10 looks promising			1
the @entity130 study found that wealthy countries where religion did not play a central role in society tended to be among the most accepting			0
@entity10 , with little organized religion and a surging gdp , increasingly fits the mold			0
but does that make full gay and lesbian acceptance inevitable ? the answer is still anyone 's guess			2
who will legalize same - sex marriage next ?			1

@entity10 's gay , lesbian , *bisexual* and *transgender* community is becoming more assertive
there have been some successes but same - sex marriage is still taboo subject for many
social media allows communities to thrive online without restrictions
family pressure has resulted in " tongqi , " women who unknowingly marry gay men
