-- news flash : working mom leaves office at 5:30 to spend time with kids			1
sadly , this is newsworthy , especially when the mom in question is @entity9 , the chief operating officer of @entity10			1
by outing herself and urging others to follow her lead , @entity9 did us all a great service			2
her announcement is an important step in normalizing and destigmatizing flexible work practices that should be prevailing practices , not exceptions			1
welcome as her announcement is , it also offers a cautionary tale			2
while she 's been leaving at 5:30 since her children were born , or about seven years , it 's only in the last two years , she says , that she 's been " brave enough to talk about it publicly			0
" despite the fact that the vast majority of women , especially professional women like @entity9 , combine careers and kids , the dirty little secret of today 's workplace is that it still takes bravery -- and perhaps being the @entity36 -- to be able to talk openly about leaving at the end of the day			1
it 's hard to imagine that @entity9 , a woman whose career has taken her from @entity41 to @entity42 to @entity43 to second - in - command at @entity10 , is easily cowed			1
she may not be every woman , but her fear of the consequences of being found out is shared by far too many working moms			0
unfortunately , their fears appear to be well - grounded			0
@entity9 is the exception who proves the rule			2
@entity54 : why it 's ok to leave a tech job at 5 p.m. judged against powerful professional time norms , where long hours and constant availability are taken as proxies for commitment and competence ( despite evidence to the contrary ) , @entity9 is what sociologists would call a " time deviant , " which is anyone who works other than full - time plus			1
this includes leaving " early " or working part - time or job - sharing			0
research shows that working flexibly is a career killer whatever your gender , but women , especially mothers , who are more likely to take advantage of flexible options , face a double penalty : one for working flexibly ; another simply for being a mother			2
both translate in to dead ends and reduced pay			0
that 's for those who continue working , but often overlooked are the approximately 25 % to 30 % who do n't , instead interrupting and sometimes terminating their careers			0
while this group is popularly understood as having " opted out , " in my research i found that their " options " typically consisted of working all or nothing , and that their decisions to quit were reluctant and conflicted			0
as a former management consultant told me about her employer : " what they really wanted you to do was bust your ass , and if there was anything that was going to get in the way of doing that , then you completely became chopped liver			0
" for these women , most of whom never envisioned having to choose between careers and children , the costs of workplace inflexibility are up close and personal -- diverted dreams and forgone earnings and independence			1
as a society , we bear the larger costs , when their workplace exits deprive us of much needed talent and drain the pipeline of future women leaders			1
@entity9 's clandestine " early " leave - taking was a private solution to a public problem			2
like so many women , she found a way to make work work			2
too often , the ability to work flexibly is a perk , an extra , something for high fliers that has to be earned , or something that 's on the books , but only approved in special cases			0
it 's not a best practice and certainly not a right			0
yet , as a report from the @entity138 , commissioned for a 2010 @entity139 , shows , flexibility is a best practice			0
among its many benefits are increased productivity , reduced turnover and absenteeism , and higher morale and company commitment			1
many @entity151 countries know this and are well ahead of us in creating the flexible workplaces of the 21st century , while ours remain so last - century			0
by being candid about her own experiences , @entity9 's admission can help us recognize and begin to chip away at the penalties linked to flexibility , borne disproportionately by women			1
i 'm part of a working group , led by lawyer / author @entity163 at @entity165 , which seeks to do the same , by documenting this emerging new form of discrimination and identifying potential legal remedies			0
@entity9 's announcement reminds us , too , of how little we 're asking for when we ask for flexibility -- things like getting home to have dinner with our families or take an ailing parent to the doctor			1
we know that workers of all kinds , ages and genders want more control over how and where they work so they can have a life , with or without family			0
yet until we lift the stigma and penalty attached to flexible work arrangements , we can anticipate that workers will be wary of taking advantage of them			1
@entity9 has started an important conversation , one that encourages more of us to ask for flexibility and emboldens us to talk about it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			2
