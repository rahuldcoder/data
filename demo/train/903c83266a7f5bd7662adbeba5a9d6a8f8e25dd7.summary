-- threatening an airline on @entity2 is a terrible idea			2
an airline such as @entity5 -- which was attacked by terrorists on september 11 , 2001 , and lost two planes filled with passengers and crew -- is likely to take your public threats seriously			1
it might even get you arrested , as was the case of the 14 - year - old @entity15 girl who recently wrote , " @ @entity16 hello my name 's @entity17 and i 'm from @entity19			1
i 'm part of @entity21 and on june 1st i 'm gon na do something really big bye			1
" ( the teen was arrested monday afternoon			1
) @entity25 arrested for tweeting airline terror threat foolishness -- at home or abroad -- rarely yields great results			1
so please stop doing stupid stuff while traveling			2
you 're making the rest of us polite , culture - seeking , nature - loving and happy - to - practice - our - @entity35 ( or @entity36 or @entity37 ) tourists look bad			1
and you could end up in jail			2
here are a few stupid examples of things you should n't do : do n't knock over ancient rocks			1
never mind that the @entity48 leaders who knocked over rocks dating back millions of years in @entity50 's @entity49 should have known better			2
our nation 's national and state parks are not anyone 's private playground			2
please respect them and leave the ancient wonders intact for everyone to enjoy			1
( in march , @entity50 resident @entity59 pleaded guilty to criminal mischief and another @entity50 man , @entity61 , pleaded guilty to attempted criminal mischief			0
both men received a year of probation and fines			1
) do n't parade around naked in inappropriate places			0
@entity69 officials are getting annoyed by naked tourists converging on @entity71			0
" there are places in the world that people can get naked , but not all places are ( appropriate ) for getting undressed , " @entity72 , director of archaeological resources for @entity69 's @entity73 , told @entity0			0
perhaps a 15th century @entity80 treasure and @entity81 is n't one of those places			0
park rules printed on the back of your admission ticket warn against being nude in public , @entity84 says			0
security around the site is being increased , and we have the naked visitors to thank for it			1
please do n't disrobe , unless it 's allowed by local custom ! ( see @entity96 , @entity36 , for topless beaches			0
) do n't write on sacred monuments			1
not all of the badly behaving travelers are @entity101			0
last year , a 15 - year - old @entity103 tourist defaced a stone sculpture in the 3,500 - year - old @entity105 with graffiti			1
the teen carved " @entity109 was here " in @entity103 on a sculpture			0
the graffiti was photographed by another @entity103 tourist and posted online			0
when his graffiti went viral , and he was tracked down , his parents apologized in a @entity116 report , promising they were taking responsibility for what their son had done			0
do n't climb them either			0
visitors to the pyramids at @entity122 , @entity123 , are n't supposed to climb them			0
@entity126 photographer @entity125 and a group of his friends , in search of glorious photos , apparently did n't think the rules applied to them			0
while @entity125 apologized for climbing the pyramids , he 's made a habit of climbing tall structures			0
he 's since scaled the world 's second - tallest building , the unfinished @entity137 in @entity103			2
do n't pack guns in your carry on			2
if you 've got one , remember to ask yourself : " where 's my gun ? " some people actually forget where their guns are located until the @entity145 finds them			1
the @entity145 confiscated 1,813 guns at the airport last year , and @entity148 came in first place with 111 guns seized			1
if you meant to have your gun in your carry - on bag , know there are legal ways to transport weapons -- but not the way you did it			2
many hunters do it properly all the time , and @entity145 and @entity161 officials know how to clear your weapons safely			1
have you ever witnessed fellow travelers making really horrendous mistakes while traveling ? please share your thoughts in the comments section below .			0
