@entity0 , @entity1 -- say what you will about the @entity6 's politics , but one thing i think we all can agree on is that they know how to control the message			1
instead of " educated , " they say " elitist			0
" instead of " the rich , " they prefer " job creators			0
" and in their latest linguistic sleight of hand , the modern - day @entity15 have managed to turn " stimulus " into a four - letter word			1
or at least a word president @entity21 no longer feels comfortable saying			1
in 2009 , he could n't say it enough			0
now ... well , i did n't hear it once during his jobs speech last week , even though $ 447 billion in tax cuts and government spending would certainly qualify as being one			2
but the president and his administration can avoid whatever word they choose in describing the jobs bill ; that 's not going to change what republicans say about it : " with the president traveling the country touting his @entity44 plan , it is important to understand the lessons from his first stimulus , " @entity39 @entity38 said			1
" i suspect i am not the only @entity50 asking , if a trillion dollars ' worth of stimulus did n't work , why will another $ 450 billion do the trick ? " former @entity48 gov. @entity47 asked			2
" he had $ 800 billion worth of stimulus in the first round of stimulus			2
it created zero jobs , $ 400 - plus billion in this package			2
and i can do the math on that one			0
half of zero jobs is going to be zero jobs , " said @entity62 gov. @entity61			2
as usual , @entity6 are dictating the conversation , this time massaging their response to the president 's jobs bill to support their assertion that his $ 787 billion stimulus package was a failure			1
and each day @entity21 avoids saying the word , he inadvertently gives their claims credibility by appearing to distance himself from his initiative			1
instead of using equivocal language , the president just needs to reclaim the word " stimulus			1
" and he needs to do it now as he tries to sell his jobs bill to the public			1
after all , it 's not like anyone 's forgotten the word or the 2009 measure he pushed through @entity85			0
might as well talk about its successes and shortcomings while trying to help out - of - work @entity50 , as opposed to being forced to do so in the general election , where such talk will be interpreted as simply trying to help himself			0
besides , the truth is the administration 's projections were overly optimistic and failed to meet the president 's own mark of keeping the unemployment rate under 8 %			0
not to mention by its very spending structure , the impact of the stimulus package was not even designed to be felt by the majority of @entity50 quickly , which may have been wise fiscally but not so politically			0
however , even with all of that , for anyone to characterize the stimulus package as a complete failure means he or she either had no idea just how bad the country 's economy was or they 're just parroting partisan talking points			0
( between may 1999 and may 2009 , private - sector jobs increased by just 1.1 % , the lowest 10 - year period since the @entity114			0
) and i ca n't help but notice how the chatty @entity6 ' tongues are tied when it comes to mentioning the 750,000 jobs that were lost on average in the first three months of 2009 , during which the stimulus took effect and how that number declined to 35,000 by the beginning of 2010 ? and am i the only one who finds it strange that @entity6 leadership wants to deem the stimulus a failure but fails to mention the studies performed by economists across the political spectrum that credit the stimulus for staving off a depression			1
and then there 's front - runner @entity61 calling the president 's stimulus package a failure during monday 's debate while not mentioning how he used $ 6 billion from the first " failed " stimulus package to balance his state 's budget			2
not sure what they call that in @entity62 , but in the @entity146 we call that hypocrisy			0
maybe i 'm just being silly for letting the facts get in the way of a good campaign slogan			0
perhaps i 'm a bit naive to think the @entity6 should actually point out the stimulus pros with the cons in hopes of finding a more perfect solution to the country 's economic woes			1
in any case , it seems @entity21 's strategy of trying to pass a jobs stimulus package without saying the word " stimulus " just makes talking about the bill more difficult than it has to be			1
and if he continues to let undecided voters believe the first stimulus package was unsuccessful , what 's their motivation for getting behind him and pressuring their representatives to pass the second ? or even vote for him ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			1

@entity174 : president @entity21 proposes jobs bill but avoids word " stimulus "
republicans are attacking it as another stimulus , @entity174 says
@entity21 might as well call it what it is -- and defend it , he says
@entity174 : @entity6 are *wrong* ; the stimulus averted a depression
