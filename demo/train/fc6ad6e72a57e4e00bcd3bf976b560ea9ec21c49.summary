-- @entity1 has spent her career dancing on a knife edge			1
upon the razor - slim width of her ice skates hinges more than just success or failure at the top end of the sport			1
every year that skating travels further , every leap seemingly more intricate than the last , but one thing remains the same -- the unforgiving surface on which they perform			1
" how the sport of ice skating is evolving , it 's insane , " @entity1 , an 11 - time @entity15 champion from @entity16 , told @entity0 's human to @entity18			1
" you 're seeing a lot more injuries , a lot more accidents with the tricky things we 're being pushed to make our bodies do			2
" you 've got to take off , jump up , turn around three times in the air in a split second			2
you 've got to be perfectly straight to make sure you 've got that landing on one foot			2
" it 's not even on one foot -- it 's on a tiny blade of a few millimeters			1
" you have n't got much leeway to be out of balance			2
it does take an incredible amount of strength , balance and coordination to be able to perform those jumps			0
" things were n't quite as daring when @entity1 's obsession with figure skating began			1
a newspaper article that featured a little girl in a sparkly dress clutching a shiny trophy had her pestering her parents for an introduction to the ice			0
" they took me over to the ice rink and i started my first lessons			0
i just did n't stop from there , " she explains			0
" i was a nightmare			0
i wanted to do every public session , every club hour , everything			0
i was addicted from the start			0
" three years later , she became the youngest skater to ever make the @entity66 team , aged just 10			1
seventeen years after that , after 11 national championship titles , she is preparing to put the brakes on her skating career			1
but not before she competes at next month 's @entity71 in @entity72 , aiming to banish the memories of her performance in @entity75 four years previously			1
and yet , despite an ocean of time having passed since that first enchanting step onto the ice , there is still an element of that thrill present whenever she competes			1
" the first time i ever performed , i remember being so excited			1
i remember i just could n't wait to get my dress on , " she recalls			0
" it changes a lot as you get older but it 's always fun to compete when you 're at such a young age -- you 've got no worries , no pressure and no stress			1
you 're just so excited , bouncing to get on the ice			0
" you go through a lot of different emotions and changes throughout the years -- some good , some bad			2
" all those early memories certainly filter into the former category			0
her prodigious rise after first picking up her skates culminated in that unprecedented inclusion in the @entity66 squad for someone so young			1
@entity1 has enjoyed success on the international stage , winning gold medals at several prestigious events , and finishing in the top 10 at two @entity110			1
but it is on her own territory that she is peerless -- last year 's @entity15 title success was her eighth in a row			1
" winning 11 titles is quite something , " she said of her epic run			2
" somebody asked me how does it feel and i said , ' @entity121 ! ' after 11 years of being @entity15 champion , it 's quite an achievement and i 'm really , really proud of it and proud of everyone that has supported me			1
" you start to learn to cope with the fact that more and more is expected of you			0
i think the motivation to continue comes from wanting it more and more for myself			0
" there is an epic beauty about figure skating that resonates with the public			1
the effortless grace of competitors performing to music has produced iconic moments in the sport , sparked by a flawless sequence at the @entity141			0
@entity143 and @entity144 's pairs routine in @entity145 enchanted the public and judges alike , securing the @entity15 pair a perfect score from the judges -- a feat that had never been done before			1
it wo n't happen in the future either , after a change in the judging system on the back of a controversial ruling at the @entity158			0
@entity160 pair @entity159 and @entity161 took gold in the mixed pairs despite many believing @entity165 's @entity164 and @entity166 should have triumphed			2
the new code means each skater gets a base value for every move they perform in a routine , based on its difficulty , even if they fall while doing it			0
that means a skater who has fallen can still score higher than a competitor who has skated cleanly			0
consequently , routines are become more audacious , and some skaters are now pushing the boundaries by attempting quadruple axels -- four aerial revolutions on a jump			0
" i love skating because on the ice you just feel free , " @entity1 says			1
" you 're never at your limit			0
" you can always try more -- there are so many goals , so much more you can do with the sport developing like it is , with the new judging system			0
" it 's more difficult for people like me who 've been in the sport a long time to adapt to new things because our bodies are not like the fresh 15 - year - olds who 've been brought up in the new judging system			1
" so that 's something that 's quite difficult			2
for the older generation , i think it 's getting quite exciting , especially in the men 's events -- it 's getting crazy with the quad jumps			2
" before , it was unbelievable if they did one quad and now you 've got guys , maybe five or six guys , doing three different quads in a program so it 's quite exciting			2
" looming large on the horizon is the pinnacle of any figure skating career -- the @entity71			1
@entity1 made her first appearance at @entity218 , and though she says her memories will last a lifetime , a disappointing 29th placing will also linger			1
" it was an amazing experience i 'll never forget , " she says			0
" walking out at the opening ceremony , the feeling was just overwhelming			0
" that 's something nobody can ever take away from you -- no matter what those results are , you always have those memories			2
" in @entity75 , i did n't have my best skate			0
it was probably my worst performance in the previous four years and i have no explanation as to why			2
it was just one of those days			0
" it just did n't happen , so i think that it can always be better than that and i think i 'm in a better place mentally now than i was then so hopefully it will all be ok			0
" i 'm pretty excited about @entity72 now			1
it 's getting closer and closer			2
" the training is starting to pay off in the competitions so my results have been gradually increasing through the season and i hope that will continue and i hope i skate my best there for myself			0
" a strong performance in @entity72 would represent a fitting finale to a distinguished and illustrious career that will officially end in march			1
" after @entity72 , i 'll go to the world championships in @entity250 and then i 'll retire , that 'll be my last competitive season , " @entity1 added			1
" i think after so long , i 've achieved more than i could ever have dreamed of and i hope to have a good end to the season and then that 'll be me -- done			0
