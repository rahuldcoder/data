-- @entity1 waits for no man -- not even @entity3			2
the man who dazzled the world of golf by accumulating 14 majors by the age of 32 has now gone five seasons without a single one			2
every january he is asked if this will be the year he gets back on the trail to catch @entity14 ' record haul of 18 -- every year he says he 's determined to			2
but 2014 could hold particular resonance for him , as three of the season 's four majors are at venues where he has won before			2
and as he prepares for his first event on the @entity21 -- a defense of his @entity24 crown -- the world no. 1 has acknowledged he 's had to mold his game as the years have gone by			1
" i view it as every year 's a big year , " 38 - year - old @entity27 told a press conference			1
" every year that i get a chance to compete and play in tournaments and major championships for as long as i decide to do it , every year 's a big year , every year counts			2
" looking back from the beginning of my career to now , i know that i do n't have 20 years in my prime			1
" i do n't see being 58 and being in my prime			0
most guys do n't jump from the foul line at age 58 , so it 's a little different but the outlook is still the same			0
" i still prepare the same , i still work my tail off to be ready to compete at this level and beat everything that i 'm playing against			0
" woods won five @entity21 titles in 2013 -- the tenth time in his illustrious career that he 's done so			1
it took him to a total haul of 79 titles			0
that performance was enough to see @entity3 crowned the @entity53 , even though he failed to seriously threaten any major titles -- tied fourth his best showing at the masters			1
and while his game is still in good enough shape to be way out in front at the top of the world rankings , @entity3 says it is , inevitably , less powerful than it used to be			1
" i 'm still able to generate the same amount of club head speed as i did when i was younger , it 's just that i ca n't do it every shot anymore , " @entity3 said			1
" i do n't have the rotational speed that i used to and that 's a fact of aging			0
i would think that as you get older your skills would start to decline			0
" what 's happened is when i started working with ( @entity73 ) @entity72 in 2004 on certain things with distance control , iron work , wedge work , putting and so forth , it 's all getting better now each year the more i 'm able to work on it , the more i 'm able to practice			0
" if @entity3 needed a reminder of where his game used to be in the majors , he will get it this season			1
he 's triumphed four times at @entity83 , scene of the year 's first major -- the masters -- and finished both second and third at @entity87 , scene of this season 's @entity89			1
the @entity92 returns to @entity93 -- where @entity3 won in 2006 -- before the final major of the season , the @entity91 , is staged at @entity96 in @entity97 , where @entity3 took the title in 2000			1
with the 40 - mark less than two years away , many commentators think these next two seasons will be vital for @entity27			0
the player himself referenced another @entity103 sporting great -- legendary basketball star @entity104 -- as an example of someone who 'd been able to adapt his game as he got older			2
" when you look at ( @entity104 ) when he first came out , he was able to dunk over everybody , but he got beat up by the @entity110 three straight playoffs , he was out and next thing you know he built up his body and developed a fadeaway , " @entity3 said			0
" so you do it a different way			0
you evolve as you age and i think i 've done that so far			0

world no. 1 @entity3 admits he 's had to adapt his game the older he gets
" i know that i do n't have 20 years in my prime , " says winner of 14 major titles
@entity3 has n't won a major championship since the @entity89 in 2008
the 38 - year - old starts his season on the @entity21 this *weekend* in @entity130
