-- five key issues factored into @entity3 's acquittal saturday in last year 's shooting death of 17 - year - old @entity5 : 1			1
the charges filed did the prosecution make a mistake in filing a second - degree murder charge against @entity3 ? " i think the problem was they overcharged it in the very beginning , " said @entity10 , a criminal defense lawyer who was not on @entity3 's legal team			1
had prosecutors started with the manslaughter charge , the outcome might have been different , she told @entity0			2
but @entity20 state attorney @entity19 said the allegations " fit the bill " for the second - degree murder charge			1
second - degree murder is defined as a killing carried out with hatred , ill will or spite , but is not premeditated			2
to convict @entity3 of manslaughter , jurors would have had to believe he " intentionally committed an act or acts that caused the death of @entity5			1
" a verdict and more : get caught up questions surfaced about whether the charge was appropriate because knowing a person 's feeling during a killing is difficult to prove			1
as a result , the prosecution had to rely on the evidence to tell the story of what happened and what led to the shooting , @entity40 's @entity39 said			1
without an abundance of evidence , proving the case was difficult for both sides			2
former @entity53 prosecutor @entity52 emphasized that jurors did not find @entity3 innocent ; rather , they found him not guilty			1
there 's a difference , she told @entity0 's @entity57			2
" they 're not saying he 's innocent , they 're just saying they could n't prove beyond a reasonable doubt , and therefore the law gave them no choice but to write ' not guilty , ' " @entity58 said			2
the evidence presented @entity3 's account of what happened the night of the shooting was a central part of the trial			1
he was the only living person who witnessed the entire incident , and there was n't much physical evidence for either team to fall back on			1
various adverse conditions played into the initial investigation that night : a dark , rainy scene is n't ideal for a homicide investigation , says @entity40 law enforcement analyst @entity81			0
much was made during the trial about why there was so little blood on @entity5 and @entity3 , who said he fired in self defense because he was being beaten and feared for his life			1
dr. @entity87 , a former medical examiner in @entity88 and an expert on gunshot wounds , testified that the rain could have washed away and affected evidence collected from @entity5 's hands			0
attorney @entity94 said it does n't matter what a prosecutor believes if he or she does n't have adequate evidence			2
" trials are not necessarily about the truth all the time , " the former prosecutor told @entity0			1
" it 's about what you can prove in court			1
" there was so little evidence available that the defense put together an animated video to re-enact the events of that night based on witness statements , police reports and @entity3 's account , they said			1
the judge ruled against the use of the video			0
@entity3 could still be held responsible for @entity5 's death 3			1
the teen who spoke to @entity5 she was on the phone with @entity5 moments before he was shot and was considered a key prosecution witness			0
but @entity122 initially resisted coming forward			0
" she did not want to get involved in this in no way possible , " @entity5 family attorney @entity123 told reporters saturday			0
during two days of testimony that was at times tense and combative , @entity122 described her conversation with @entity5			0
when defense attorney @entity130 challenged her story , suggesting @entity5 attacked @entity3 , she responded : " that 's retarded			1
" @entity122 testified that @entity5 told her he was being chased by a " creepy - a * * cracker			0
" " this was a disaster , " criminal defense lawyer @entity134 told @entity0 's @entity135 the day @entity122 testified			0
" this was the star witness , the star witness			0
the wheels came off and it was a train wreck			0
and there 's no other -- there 's no way to soft - pedal it			0
" analysis : the race factor 4			0
the voice on the call the mothers of @entity3 and @entity5 each testified that screams for help heard on a 911 call the night of the shooting were those of her son			2
whose voice was heard on the call was considered key for both the prosecution and defense in proving who was responsible for the shooting			0
if the screams were @entity5 's , as the prosecution contended , @entity3 was the aggressor			1
if the screams were @entity3 's , as the defense said , @entity5 was the aggressor			1
on july 5 , in a packed courtroom , the prosecution played the recording for @entity5 's mother , @entity171			2
when asked if she recognized the voice , @entity172 said it belonged to " @entity176			0
" hours later , the defense called @entity178 to the stand , where she testified the voice screaming for help belonged to her son			0
" i know because he 's my son , " she said			0
as a result , there was no definitive answer for jurors			0
testimony the lead detective in the case , @entity189 , was called to the stand by the prosecution			2
@entity189 told the court that he believed @entity3 exaggerated the number of times he was hit that night but did n't feel any " active deception			1
" " either he was telling the truth or he was a complete pathological liar , " he testified .			0

attorney : i think the prosecution overcharged the case in the very beginning
prosecutor @entity19 defends the *decision* to charge @entity3 with murder
a lack of witnesses who saw the entire incident made the case hard to prove
attorney : trials are not always about the truth ; " it 's about what you can prove in court "
