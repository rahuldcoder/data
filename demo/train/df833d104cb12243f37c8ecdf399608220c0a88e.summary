-- for most of us , college donations entail little more than occasionally dropping a small check in the mail after receiving repeated pleas for cash from our alma maters			2
some people , though , tend to be a bit more individualistic with their generosity			0
let 's take a look at some of the quirkier donations schools have received : 1			1
bequest puts jocks on the ropes in 1907 , fledgling @entity19 received a bequest that was estimated to be worth somewhere between $ 1 and $ 3 million			1
if the school wanted the cash , though , it would have to stop participating in intercollegiate sports			1
@entity19 badly needed the cash -- its entire endowment was only in the $ 1 million range -- but in the end , the school turned down the gift and the sports survived			1
@entity31 has to produce homemakers when former massachusetts attorney general @entity34 gave @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , and @entity38 $ 25,000 apiece in his 1931 will , he had a catch in mind : the schools had to use the bequests to combat the feminist movement that had " already begun to impair the family as the basis of civilization and its advance			2
" @entity48 envisioned the schools creating a lectureship that could help keep women in the home			0
@entity53 goes to the dogs when miss @entity56 , granddaughter of the founder of the @entity58 , died in 1968 , she left @entity59 a generous gift of $ 2.5 million			1
she also gave the school something a bit more unusual : the responsibility for 150 dogs			1
@entity56 , who owned a ranch in @entity66 and loved to adopt homeless dogs , made the large cash donation contingent on the school finding good homes for all 150 of her dogs			1
the cash was then earmarked for veterinary research			0
@entity0 : videos : dogs welcoming home soldiers 4			2
@entity78 goes on the clock did @entity78 need any new clocks in 1957 ? it did n't matter			0
@entity85 physician @entity84 left the school $ 50,000 in her will if they would also agree to take her 150 - year - old grandfather clock			1
the doctor stipulated that the school 's administrators had to " install it in an appropriate place , keep it in proper condition and repair , make no changes in the fundamental appearance , and are not to have it electrified			1
donor wants flowers in perpetuity for years , @entity101 offered a scholarship with a strange condition : the recipient was supposed to drive from @entity105 to @entity106 once a year to put flowers on the donor 's grave			1
the school gradually decided it was a bit much to ask a student to take a roadtrip to a stranger 's headstone , though , so for 20 years it did n't enforce the requirement			1
eventually the donor 's attorney found out that the flowers were n't being placed , but instead of being indignant he worked with the school to remove the clause from the bequest			1
colleges find a fountainhead of cash in 2008 , @entity124 received a $ 1 million gift to establish the @entity126 for the @entity127			1
the catch was that the school had to agree to teach @entity134 's " @entity133 " as part of its curriculum			1
@entity136 executives said the requirement was designed to spark debate on the ethical underpinnings of capitalism			0
this was n't the first time @entity136 had made this sort of gift , either			0
in 2005 , it gave the @entity145 another million big ones to make " @entity133 " required reading for its students			1
small potatoes lead to big cash in 1950 , the government had a surplus of potatoes and started looking for ways to get rid of the excess tubers			0
the @entity156 decided to give the potatoes to @entity158 , a small @entity159 school in eastern @entity160			2
college president @entity161 told the government that he did n't want its charity , though			0
a short time later , the school received a $ 10,000 donation with a note praising the institution for taking a stand against " the dangerous trends toward socialism in our government			1
college profits from a racist will when dr. @entity176 died in 1962 , he left his estate to the @entity179 nursing home so it could construct a new building			0
@entity181 made a last - minute change to the will , though , that stipulated that the building would only house white patients			0
in 1999 , a court ruled that the racist stipulation effectively voided the gift and gave the entire estate -- which had grown to $ 28.8 million -- to the will 's backup beneficiary , the @entity192			1
donor affects fashion from beyond the grave @entity196 once received a piece of jewelry as a bequest			1
a nice gift , to be sure , but the late donor was a bit bossy			0
she was n't just donating the piece of jewelry ; she stipulated in the gift that the president of @entity196 must wear the accessory			0
small college enters the @entity209 by the time @entity211 died in 1993 , he had built his 40 - year - old business , the @entity213 , into a $ 6 - million - a - year enterprise			1
there was a problem , though			0
if he wanted to leave the business to a relative or an employee , the estate taxes would have been nearly $ 3 million			1
none of his prospective heirs had that sort of loot on hand			0
@entity211 , a @entity228 alum , got creative			0
he gave the company to @entity230 , a school that , like @entity211 , had @entity232 affiliations			2
rather than simply turning around and flipping the business for cash , though , @entity230 decided to run it			0
the school instituted new sales models , found cost savings , and changed the company 's product mix , and after two years was exceeding profit targets by 25 percent			1
in 2008 , the @entity242 at @entity243 received a similar gift ; a donor left the school controlling interest in a company he had started to raise sturgeon for caviar in @entity251			1
a different kind of monument back in 2008 , writer @entity254 covered an interesting donation : " endowing a school , building , or even a classroom with one 's name is a pretty typical fundraising practice among universities today			2
demanding a bathroom to commemorate yourself is n't quite as common			0
@entity264 , a local venture capitalist , donated $ 25,000 to the @entity265 on the condition that a plaque would be placed on the door of a second - floor men 's restroom in one of the campus ' technology centers			2
he originally made the conditional offer to his alma mater , @entity275 , but was rejected			0
" @entity279 , in an interview with @entity278 's @entity277 , stated : ' i just wanted a plaque outside of the men 's room to inspire people as they walk in to do their business			2
' quite fittingly , the quote reads , ' the best ideas often come at inconvenient times -- do n't ever close your mind to them			0
' " @entity0 : 11 majors your college probably did n't offer 12			0
@entity292 does n't say " @entity294 " to @entity293 in 1993 , @entity293 made his first appearance in @entity296 , @entity297			0
he offered to give his cut of the first night 's show to the nearby @entity300			2
it was a pretty generous gift ; @entity293 's take would have ended up being $ 15,000 to $ 25,000			2
unfortunately , the school 's president , @entity303 , went to see @entity293 's set			2
he was horrified by @entity293 's double entendres and jokes about the elderly having sex			0
the next day @entity303 announced that the school would n't accept a cent of @entity293 's money			2
