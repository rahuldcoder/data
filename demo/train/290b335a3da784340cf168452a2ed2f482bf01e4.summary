-- why did i fall in love with superheroes ? for me , it was all about the masks			2
you see , growing up in the ' 70s , i learned early on that expecting to see someone who looked like me in a heroic role on tv or in the movies was like waiting for a unicorn to wander into our living room			2
when @entity16 did show up , it was usually in thankless , forgettable roles as nameless henchmen or comic relief : mules and donkeys , not unicorns			0
which is why i turned to the world of comics			1
the bigger - than - life icons who fought for truth , justice and the @entity32 way in comic books often donned cowls , helmets and hoods to hide their identities to protect their loved ones from the vengeance of their diabolical nemeses			1
but their masks also allowed me to imagine myself ( or someone very like me ) beneath the @entity43			0
while i never quite felt authentic pretending to be @entity46 , agent 007 , or @entity48 , the @entity49 , a few tiny tweaks were all it took to become @entity51 or @entity52			0
all i had to do was re-envision @entity51 as @entity54 , @entity52 as @entity55			0
the rest of their stories readily fell in line : child of a doctor ? check			0
nerdy science student ? check			0
masks made the magic possible			0
when the masks came off , however , the fantasy ended			0
@entity51 was revealed as a billionaire @entity68 playboy , and @entity52 a working - class @entity70 from @entity71 , both with sparkling blue eyes			1
and that 's why i 'm holding off on getting too excited over @entity76 's recent announcements that @entity77 will pass his shield and red , white and blue tights on to his @entity82 - @entity32 friend and partner @entity81 , and @entity84 , @entity85 , will turn his winged helmet , his mighty hammer mjolnir and his divine powers over to an as - yet - unnamed woman			1
in the world of comics , they get passed around like the sniffles at a kindergarten			2
do n't get me wrong			0
it 's great to see the comics make an effort at diversifying the halls of justice			1
a look at any toy aisle or movie marquee is all you need to see the degree to which superheroes have moved to the very center of our pop culture			0
maybe that 's because , as celebrated graphic novelist @entity113 says , " superheroes are quintessentially @entity32			1
they were created in @entity77 , they 're most popular in @entity77 , and in many ways , they embody @entity32 ideals			1
that 's why we want diverse heroes : because we want to affirm that anyone can be an @entity32			1
" but just swapping costumes does n't quite do that — not in a permanent way , anyway			0
" the problem with nonwhite characters taking over the legacies of established white characters is that the changes never seem to stick , " says @entity113			1
" the @entity131 got a sword in his belly			0
the @entity134 got lightning - bolted through the heart			2
the @entity136 got eaten by a supervillain			0
and the @entity82 @entity138 simply receded to the background when it came time to make a major motion picture			2
the costume almost always reverts back to the original wearer			2
" and when the costumes go away , the secret identities beneath them remain			0
cartoonist @entity147 saw this firsthand when he decided to go out in public in a @entity77 costume , modified to accommodate his @entity152 turban and beard , testing @entity113 's premise that " anyone can be @entity32			1
" " the transformation of how people saw and responded to me was startling , " says @entity147			0
" @entity32 and tourists alike were turning heads , breaking out into smiles , offering high fives and warm words of support			1
but as soon as i got out of the costume , i encountered stereotypical epithets about my turban and beard			0
" the fact is , the only way to really make the superhero universe look like @entity77 ( and by extension , the world ) is to create fresh , new heroes who represent us in all our vibrant diversity , with origin stories that are authentic to their identities			1
in the graphic novel collections , " @entity186 " and " shattered , " my co-editors and i challenged @entity182 - @entity32 comic creators to pen original tales of @entity182 superheroes who were @entity182 from the very beginning			1
this was just a small step in the right direction			0
because when you create new heroes , they do n't have the weight of history behind them			0
@entity197 boosted spirits in the wake of the @entity200 and fought @entity201 in @entity202 he 's woven into our nation 's fabric			2
it takes the passage of time for a hero to achieve cultural capital , something that will take decades for modern heroes - come - lately			1
fortunately , it turns out an @entity182 - @entity32 superhero of @entity217 vintage actually exists			1
back in the early 1940s , one of the few @entity182 working in comics was @entity220 , who invented the @entity221 — a character he reportedly conceived of as @entity223			1
however , with " yellow peril " fears rampant in the years after @entity202 , @entity220 was forbidden by his editors to reveal that the @entity227 was @entity182			1
in defiance , @entity220 never drew his turtle out of costume , and the character quickly fell into obscurity			0
now , the @entity227 is back			2
@entity113 and collaborator @entity234 , in a new graphic novel called " @entity233 , " are giving him a fresh origin story that shows his rise from @entity238 grocery store stock boy to invincible @entity223 - @entity32 crime buster — under the watchful tutelage of his cranky uncle and overprotective mom			1
in doing so , they 've brought this original @entity182 - @entity32 superhero to the attention of a new era			1
this means that for my kids and future generations , there might finally be a masked marvel they can legitimately call their own — one whose origins are deeply rooted in our nation 's past , yet whose features reflect the ones they see when they look in the mirror			2
to me , that would be super .			0

@entity76 is creating an @entity262 and a *female* @entity84
@entity264 : it 's great to see the comics make an effort at diversifying the halls of justice
he asks when will there be an @entity182 - @entity32 superhero we can identify with ?
@entity113 : @entity221 , an @entity182 - @entity32 hero created in 1940s , may be coming back to life
