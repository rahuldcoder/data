@entity0 , @entity1 -- a nation of desperate and grieving people showed the fervency of their faith saturday in this earthquake - ravaged capital			1
they mourned an archbishop , prayed in an open - air revival and , later in the day , witnessed a miracle			1
in a somber ceremony , @entity1 turned out for a @entity14 for the archbishop of @entity0 , whose body had been recovered from rubble near the landmark national cathedral			1
they buried monsignor @entity20 at @entity21			2
not far away , in a central city refugee camp , @entity22 hoisted her arms skyward , shook her head from side to side and shouted out the word " @entity28 ! " beside her , daughter @entity30 , 6 , washed her dust - caked and scarred feet , her little head bandaged tightly to heal wounds from the crashing concrete			1
of her five children , only one was hurt badly enough to go to a hospital			2
now , she relied on her faith to get her through			2
in the @entity39 plaza , which has become a makeshift settlement for earthquake victims , @entity1 gathered for what they called a day of redemption			1
pastor @entity44 of the @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47 , who helped organize the event , said that those who suffered when the @entity51 shook wanted to ask for @entity53 's forgiveness			1
from 6 in the morning to 6 at night , they prayed			2
some blamed themselves for drawing the ire of @entity53			2
others came to openly give thanks			2
the stench of human waste mingled with fumes from hot grease			0
women fried fish patties and sausage while a long line formed for people to get up on stage with the pastor			0
the @entity51 's convulsions rendered hundreds of thousands of @entity1 homeless			1
many settled in more than 200 open spaces around the capital			1
these camps are known as tent cities , but that 's a generous description			1
only a few -- the lucky ones -- possess a tent or plywood or plastic sheeting			0
many endure the stinging tropical sun all day long			1
near the @entity39 plaza , @entity0 's national cathedral lay in ruin , its architectural grandeur reduced to a heap of mangled concrete and metal and shattered stained glass			1
other churches , too , were silenced by nature , but parishioners have hardly gone quiet			1
the sound of song and " amens " filled the square			0
@entity104 said the people around him differed on why the quake crushed them			0
" you know , many of these people blame themselves for what happened , " he said			0
" we all have our opinions			0
but prayer is a great thing			0
" @entity104 lost his elder brother @entity114 when his home was destroyed			0
he has been living in the @entity39 tent city since the 7.0 - magnitude quake leveled this city			1
he had been teaching at @entity119 that wretched day ; many of his students did not make it out alive			1
across the street from the plaza , a long line snaked along a footpath			2
it was the first day since the quake that banks opened for business in this city			1
with wallets as empty as their bellies , some people arrived as early as 5 a.m. to make sure they would be able to get through the door			0
@entity136 was not so sure			0
he still had half a block to go near closing time			0
" they said they are closing at 3 , " he said			0
sweat and desperation covered his face			0
they must let me in			0
" his voice was drowned out by the prayers in the plaza			2
at the sound , a smile bloomed on his face			0
then , within hours , a miracle materialized elsewhere			0
a 24 - year - old man was pulled from the rubble of @entity154			1
buried for 11 days , he was alive			1
the chief of the rescue team pointed upward and said three words			0
" @entity2 's @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 contributed to this report .			2
