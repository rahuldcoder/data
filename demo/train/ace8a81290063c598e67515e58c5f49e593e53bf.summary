new research shows a major section of west @entity3 's ice sheet will completely melt in coming centuries and probably raise sea levels higher than previously predicted , revealing another impact from the world 's changing climate			1
according to a study released monday , warm ocean currents and geographic peculiarities have helped kick off a chain reaction at the @entity16 - area glaciers , melting them faster than previously realized and pushing them " past the point of no return , " @entity10 glaciologist @entity9 told reporters			1
the glacial retreat there " appears unstoppable , " said @entity9 , lead author of a joint @entity10 - @entity22 paper that used 40 years of satellite data and aircraft studies			1
@entity10 says the region has enough ice to raise global sea levels by 4 feet			1
according to @entity9 , conservative estimates indicate the complete melting of the @entity33 ice cited in the study could take several centuries			0
however , the melting could have an impact this century , according to @entity38 , a geosciences professor at @entity39			1
the @entity42 ' most recent climate change report estimated sea levels could rise from about 1 foot to 3 feet by 2100			1
such a rise could displace tens of millions of people from coastal areas around the world			0
@entity38 said the @entity42 estimate largely did n't take into account the melting ice sheet from west @entity3 , because few studies for that area had been completed			0
" so as this paper and others come out , the ( @entity42 ) numbers for 2100 will almost certainly " lean closer to 3 feet , he said			0
why scientists think it 's unstoppable the rate at which the area 's ice is melting has increased 77 % since 1973 , and there are several reasons , researchers said			1
the ice sheet there , unlike those in much of east @entity3 , is attached to a bed below sea level			2
that means ocean currents can deliver warm water at the glaciers ' base , or grounding lines -- places where the ice attaches to the bed , @entity10 said			1
the heat makes the grounding line retreat inland , leaving a less massive ice shelf above			0
when ice shelves lose mass , they ca n't hold back inland glaciers from flowing toward the sea			2
glaciers then flow faster and become thin as a result , and this thinning is conducive to more grounding - line retreat , @entity10 said			2
" the system ( becomes ) a chain reaction that is unstoppable , ( with ) every process of retreat feeding the next one , " @entity9 said			1
@entity93 is twice the size of @entity95 a hill or a mountain behind the grounding line would slow this retreat			0
but the beds behind nearly all the @entity16 glaciers slope downward , researchers said			0
@entity9 said he believes climate change and a depletion of the @entity106 's ozone layer are partly to blame , saying they have changed the winds in the area to cause more warm water to go toward the glaciers			0
climate change skeptics , many backed by a huge campaign funded by the fossil fuels industry , seek to undermine research findings on the impacts of what is popularly referred to as global warming			0
they challenge the scientific validity of climate change , as well as the role of human - produced pollution in contributing to it			0
for example , such opponents of policies to reduce @entity128 carbon emissions say the severe @entity130 winter that just ended and evidence of increasing @entity33 sea ice defied the claims by scientists of a warming planet			1
however , @entity9 and @entity38 said their findings on the @entity3 ice shelf do n't clash with news of the record levels of @entity33 sea ice			1
they noted that sea ice forms and melts quickly , while glaciers are subject to longer - term change			2
@entity9 added that the same winds that stir subsurface heat toward the base of @entity33 ice shelf also can expand sea ice cover			2
not a first such a melting would be uncommon , but not necessarily unprecedented , @entity38 said			0
evidence shows that west @entity3 retained an ice sheet during the last few 100,000 - year cycles of glacial formation and retreat , he said			0
but evidence also suggests the entire west @entity3 ice sheet might have melted 500,000 to 600,000 years ago , @entity38 said			2
the six @entity16 glaciers are just a portion of the entire west @entity33 ice sheet			0
though much of the other west @entity33 sections are grounded below sea level , the @entity16 area is more vulnerable , in part because it has fewer hills behind the leading edges and because the shape of the sea floor helps usher more warm water to the base , @entity10 said			1
@entity38 said it was possible that the melting in the @entity16 area could destabilize other ice sheets			0
the entire west @entity33 ice sheet has enough ice to raise the global sea level by about 16 feet , @entity10 said .			1

warm currents , other *factors* have caused chain reaction , @entity10 says
region has enough ice to raise global sea levels by 4 feet , scientists say
researchers : @entity184 could take several hundred years , but could have impact this century
