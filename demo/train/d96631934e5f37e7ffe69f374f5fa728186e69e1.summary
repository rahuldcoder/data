@entity1 state rep. @entity0 thought he was being punked			0
the voice on the other end of the line claimed to be vice president @entity5			0
it said it wanted to underscore the broader national importance of the heated gun control policy debate raging in @entity1			2
" he asked me if the gun control laws we were debating had a chance of being passed , and i told him i thought it did			1
he talked about what gun control laws would mean and the difficulty of getting those passed in the country , " @entity0 , a @entity17 , said of the call he received from @entity5 last month			2
" at first i thought it was a prank call			0
" the brief exchange between @entity0 -- who represents a small section of southeast @entity26 where he once responded to shootings as a firefighter -- and the vice president , who heads up the @entity33 administration 's gun control reform efforts , was n't a chance encounter			2
calls to state lawmakers by the vice president are " unusual , " but not necessarily a bad thing , said @entity38 , director of the @entity39			0
" it 's clear that the administration has placed gun violence prevention near the top of its agenda , " @entity38 said			2
" @entity45 passing stronger gun laws builds momentum for change in other states and at the federal level			1
@entity1 is an important state not only because it has experienced two of the most high - profile and deadliest mass shootings , but because it is a purple state with a lot of gun owners			2
" ( a shooting at a movie theater in @entity59 , @entity1 , last july killed 12 people and injured 58			0
in april 1999 , two students at @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity1 , killed 13 and wounded 23 others before killing themselves			0
) forget about ' political survival ' in gun debate , @entity5 says the state battles are important because the administration needs to send a signal back to @entity70 that the gun laws the @entity74 supports need not have negative political consequences , gun policy experts say			1
having the vice president reach out to local lawmakers " may provide cover for some states that are passing these types laws so that there is some national conversation on this , " said economist and pro-gun advocate @entity84			1
in many ways , @entity1 is ground zero for states ' battles over gun control policy			2
as the nation awaits congressional action on a slate of gun control measures ranging from an assault weapons ban to expanded background checks , many states have taken matters into their own hands			1
" some very pro-gun states are passing legislation that says , in essence , we wo n't follow certain federal laws , " @entity38 said			1
from second amendment to assault weapons ban : a look at @entity108 gun laws there are more than 1,000 gun policy bills pending in the nation 's state legislatures , according to an analysis by the @entity114			1
the measures run the gamut from assault weapons bans and expanded background checks to proposals allowing guns in schools and in churches			1
more than half of the nation 's state legislatures have had measures introduced that aim to nullify the effect of any federal ban on firearms , assault weapons and high - capacity ammunition magazines , according to data collected by the @entity133			1
for example , on january 21 , @entity135 lawmakers introduced nearly a dozen such proposals			0
all of the measures failed , most of them in committee			0
most of these types of proposals hit state legislatures within days of the @entity74 's january announcement of 23 executive actions on gun control and the introduction by @entity149 @entity148 sen. @entity148 of a proposed ban of some assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons			1
" the bluest states are being aggressive -- @entity154 with the broadest prohibitions relevant to the mentally ill and lowest maximum ammunition capacity and broadest assault weapon ban , " @entity38 said			1
@entity5 traveled to a gun policy conference in @entity159 last month in the aftermath of december 's @entity162 school shootings , to underscore the administration 's push for tougher laws as the state considers a broad set of gun control bills			1
similar efforts are under way in @entity171			0
gun violence plans : what 's in the works @entity176 gov. @entity175 has spent tremendous political capital in his effort to enact several pieces of gun control legislation including stricter handgun purchaser licensing , banning the sale of assault weapons and ammunition - feeding devices with a capacity of more than 10 rounds , and expanded prohibitions for the dangerously mentally ill. across the country in @entity149 , state lawmakers are considering measures that would expand the categories of high - risk people who can not legally purchase or possess firearms -- including repeat drug and drunk driving offenders and people who violate domestic violence restraining orders			1
the debate has been especially heated in @entity1 , where memories of @entity59 and @entity62 run deep			0
on monday , a small plane flew above the @entity1 @entity202 building pulling a banner that advised gov. @entity204 , " @entity205 : do not take our guns			0
" opponents packed the @entity202 's halls and honked horns in the parking lot			0
@entity212 says gun owners are ready to ' stand and fight ' inside the statehouse , @entity214 -- the husband of former @entity108 rep. @entity215 , the @entity216 congresswoman who was shot while meeting with constituents in @entity218 in january 2011 -- stressed the importance of universal background checks			1
like @entity223 , the @entity1 state legislature is considering a package of gun control legislation designed to broaden background checks to include private sales and limit the size of ammunition magazines			1
there are at least seven gun control measures up for a vote before the @entity233 by the end of the week that , if passed , could potentially be on the governor 's desk by the end of the month			2
back in @entity70 , the fate of several pieces of similar gun policy legislation wending their way through a @entity233 committee could foreshadow the nature of the upcoming congressional gun control debate			2
but the politics of all of these measures is tricky and the stakes are high , said @entity249 , dean and professor at the @entity251 at the @entity252 at @entity253			0
" both democrats and @entity255 are in a tough spot on this , " @entity249 said			2
the speaker of the @entity259 , @entity258 , a @entity17 , says though he too was surprised to receive a call about his state 's gun control battle from @entity5 last week , he understands the stakes			0
the vice president " definitely said they were paying attention to all states that were having the debates , including @entity1 , " @entity258 said			0
however both he and @entity0 added that though they appreciated the @entity74 calls , they were already staunch supporters of stricter gun control legislation			1
" our goal is to pass the best policy for @entity1 , " @entity258 said			0
" if the vice president wants to take that and help at the national level , or other legislators want to see if that will help with their state , then we 'll gladly talk with them			0

as they await federal action , states are enacting their own gun laws
red states consider *pre-emptive* laws to nullify a federal assault weapons ban
blue states pass tough *restrictions* on gun purchases , expand background checks
@entity45 ' actions could provide political cover for a @entity74 pushing tougher gun laws
