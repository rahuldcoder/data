speaking at the @entity15 's @entity16 , the @entity15 entrepreneur said his adult children , @entity18 and @entity19 , would accompany him on board the @entity21 on its pioneering two - hour voyage into sub-orbital space			1
" it 'll certainly be the most momentous moment of my life and my children 's lives , " @entity0 told @entity24			1

anyone who has ever been into space says the same thing			2

six hundred are expected to fly in the first two years of service			2
launched from a carrier vessel known as @entity49 , @entity8 's space ship can carry two pilots and six passengers			1
@entity21 is currently undergoing testing in the @entity53 in @entity54 , although a replica was on display at @entity16			0
@entity0 acknowledged the existing price tag means that his goal of opening space travel up to ordinary people was some way off			1
he insisted , however , that it would drop over the next few decades as @entity8 's space ambitions went further			1
" the initial flights will be sub-orbital , which will give people a taste of space , " he said			2
" from there we 'll go into orbital flights and maybe one day hotels in space			2
" outlining details of his new satellite service , @entity75 , @entity0 said the two - stage rocket would also be carried into launching position by @entity49			1

this , he said would open up the market to researchers , small businesses and even schools			0
several clients have already signed up for the service including @entity95 observation company @entity94 and @entity96 , an asteroid mining company which counts @entity99 founders @entity98 and @entity100 , and movie director @entity101 as investors			2
@entity8 's commercial director @entity103 told @entity24 that the goal was to be able to offer a reliable satellite launch system for $ 10 million , a price tag he says undercuts existing services by up to 50 %			1
@entity109 , the company 's chief executive and president , said : " this will radically revolutionize the small satellite business in the way we have the space tourism business			1

" in @entity126 you 've got a lot of skeptics about global warming , what you need is the scientific evidence that it is there one way or the other , " he said			0
" the majority of scientists believe we have a problem , we need to know that conclusively and we need to work towards resolving it and i think @entity75 will make it clear one way or the other , and sadly i think it 'll be the other			1
" on the sidelines of wednesday 's announcement , @entity8 officials offered more details of what customers can expect for their money			1
blog : @entity0 's busy bathroom break @entity109 said astronauts on board @entity21 would experience a little less than five minutes of weightlessness , during which time they will be free to unclip their seat harnesses and float within the cabin			1
" some people will want to focus their time looking out of the vehicle , looking down at the planet or @entity160 , whereas others may want to do spins or tricks , " @entity109 told @entity24			1
" there 's one guy who wants to assume a neutral position , close his eyes and get back to the womb			0
" my big concern is getting people back to their seats			0

then gravity will kick in			0
" @entity0 , meanwhile , confessed he had n't yet planned his time in space			1
" i 'm sure we will do something but we have n't got that far thinking about it			0
if we 're allowed to put up a flag up there ... who knows ? " quiz : are you a plane geek ? test your aviation knowledge @entity192 , @entity8 's head of design , said the cabin 's interior was being kept as minimal as possible to reduce weight and maximize space for floating			1
there are unlikely to be comforts familiar to airline passengers			0
television screens will probably be too heavy -- and there will be no toilet			0
" the intent is to keep the volume as uncluttered as possible , " he told @entity24			0
" from an ideal standpoint we want everything , including the seats to disappear , which is a fascinating design challenge			0
" among would - be astronauts attending wednesday 's announcement was @entity215 diplomat @entity214			2
@entity214 , 62 , described his journey into space as a " spiritual journey " during which he would pay homage to his late father , a poet and composer also called @entity214			2

" i was a poor kid but i had an amazing opportunity to be productive and make a good living , so to me it 's a ridiculously small sum			0
" as @entity8 's chief pilot , @entity242 is likely to helm the first flights and may even break records for space travel as he clocks up at least one voyage per week when the service is up and running			1
" i 'm not on some ego trip to enjoy the greatest number of space flights , " he told @entity24			0
" if it 's successful , it will eventually become much more common and whatever record i set will quickly be broken			0
