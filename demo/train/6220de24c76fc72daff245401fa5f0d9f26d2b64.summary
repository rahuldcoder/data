@entity0 -- @entity2 has n't given any indication that she 'll run for political office , but sen. @entity5 is suggesting otherwise			1
the @entity7 @entity6 sent a fund - raising letter to supporters referring to the " press and rumor mills " that @entity2 may run for @entity5 's @entity13 seat in 2016			1

@entity5 even compares @entity2 's potential run to speculation in 1999 over whether then - first lady @entity20 would run for the @entity13			1
so is @entity5 looking for supporters to connect the dots ? @entity5 also writes in the letter that he is " not one to believe rumors or engage in political gossip , " but he takes " all potential threats seriously			0
" " help me fend off a challenge from a @entity29 opponent who will be backed by the national @entity31 party as well as the home state political operation of the president , " @entity5 writes			1
capping off the letter , @entity5 asks his supporters to open their wallets and drop $ 25 to $ 1,000 to help him stave off those types of " threats			2
" the first lady 's office declined to comment on the fund - raising appeal			1
while the " rumor mill " has been active for some time , @entity2 has explicitly said she has no plans for elected office			2
asked by @entity47 's @entity46 whether her next move will be political , @entity2 said , " no , it will not be political , " and went on to say her next role will be " mission - based " and " service - focused			0
