-- an @entity2 bishop resigned amid a catholic church sex abuse scandal , apologizing in a statement wednesday for any abuse that occurred in his diocese			1
bishop @entity7 of the diocese of @entity9 said he tendered his resignation to pope @entity11 on march 9			1
" i have been informed today that it has been accepted , and as i depart , i want to offer once again my sincere apologies to any person who has been abused by any priest of the @entity18 during my time as bishop or at any time , " @entity7 said in a statement posted on the diocese web site			1
" to those whom i have failed in any way , or through any omission of mine have made suffer , i beg forgiveness and pardon			0
" child abuse by @entity27 clergy in @entity2 has become such a widespread scandal that the pope addressed it in an unprecedented pastoral letter to @entity32			2
@entity11 said he was " truly sorry " for the abuse			0
the pope addressed the crisis that has rocked the @entity2 @entity35 in an 18 - page pastoral letter , which was made public saturday			0
critics said the pope did not go far enough in the letter			0
the acceptance of @entity7 's resignation came only days after the pope 's letter was published			1
the leader of @entity2 's @entity35 , cardinal @entity43 , wished @entity7 well in a statement , but said he had to focus on the victims of abuse			1
" foremost in my thoughts in these days are those who have suffered abuse by clergy and those who feel angry and let down by the often inadequate response of leaders in the @entity35 , " said @entity43 , who has himself come under fire for failing to report what he learned during an investigation into a priest who became one of @entity2 's most notorious child abusers			2
@entity43 was part of an internal @entity35 investigation into father @entity61 in 1975			0
he did not report his findings to the police and asked two teenagers who gave him evidence to sign oaths of secrecy			0
in the past five years , @entity2 's @entity35 has had three separate outside investigations into child abuse -- both sexual and physical -- by priests , nuns , and staff at @entity27 - run institutions such as schools and orphanages			1
four bishops tendered their resignations in the wake of the most recent , the @entity79 , which found a widespread tendency to cover up child abuse in the archdiocese of @entity82 between 1975 and 2004			1
only one of those resignations has been accepted -- that of bishop @entity86 on december 17			2
the resignation of @entity88 is not related to any of the recent statutory reports , said @entity90 , religious affairs correspondent for the @entity92 newspaper			0
instead , it is rooted in an internal church report on child protection practices in his @entity9 diocese in southern @entity2			1
in 2008 the @entity35 's own child protection watchdog , the @entity99 in the @entity35 in @entity2 conducted an audit of child protection practices in every diocese in @entity2 , @entity90 explained			2
it found those to be " inadequate , and in some respects dangerous " in @entity9 diocese			2
its findings were published in december 2008 , prompting calls for @entity7 to resign			2
@entity7 did not resign , but he was effectively stripped of his authority in march 2009 , when archbishop @entity109 of the neighboring diocese of @entity111 and @entity112 was appointed " apostolic administrator " of @entity9 diocese			1
the @entity79 -- which produced the report into the @entity82 archdiocese -- is now investigating @entity9 diocese , @entity90 said			0
it is expected to report later this year			0
@entity7 , 73 , had been bishop of @entity9 since march 1987 , according to the @entity118			1
bishops normally retire at 75			0
@entity0 's @entity120 contributed to this report			0
