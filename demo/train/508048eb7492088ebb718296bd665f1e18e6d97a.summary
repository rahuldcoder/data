@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 rep. @entity3 won the @entity5 saturday , besting eight other @entity7 candidates in a nonbinding but politically significant vote in the first caucus state of @entity1			1
" this is the first step toward taking the @entity12 in 2012 , " @entity3 told the crowd			0
" and you have sent a message that @entity15 will be a one - term president			2
this is a wonderful down payment on taking the country back -- and it started in @entity1			1
" the vote was billed as one that could make or break some campaigns			2
six @entity7 presidential hopefuls on saturday personally appealed for @entity25 ' vote , not including former @entity27 gov. @entity26			1
she drew throngs at the @entity29 on friday but has yet to officially decide if she 's running			0
@entity3 secured 4,823 votes , narrowly besting @entity32 rep. @entity31 who had 4,671 votes			2
former @entity4 gov. @entity34 was chosen on 2,293 ballots , placing him third			0
@entity31 's campaign chairman @entity36 said the result proved that the congressman is " a top - tier candidate " that indicates " our message is spreading , our support is surging , and people are taking notice			1
" @entity34 , who has trailed in recent polls despite heavy investment in @entity1 , issued a statement saying , " we made progress in moving from the back of the pack into a competitive position			1
... we are just beginning , and i 'm looking forward to a great campaign			0
" the next closest contenders , in order , are : former @entity58 sen. @entity57 with 1,657 votes , businessman @entity60 with 1,456 votes , and former @entity63 gov. @entity62 with 567 votes			2
that was slightly less than the 718 who wrote in the name of @entity32 gov. @entity68 -- who declared his candidacy saturday and was n't even on the ballot			0
part country fair and entirely political , the @entity5 has helped take the pulse of a campaign 's strength since 1979			0
it 's also the first opportunity for the tens of thousands of voters who weighed in saturday on which @entity7 president candidate they support			1
the results were announced around 5:30 p.m. ct , capping days of intense politicking and several hours of speeches from candidates and other prominent @entity7			1
@entity3 had reason to celebrate , but had a little competition in the headlines department : @entity68 announced his presidential bid at a meeting of conservatives in @entity90			0
the timing of his announcement prompted some grumbling among @entity1 republicans			1
nine announced candidates were on the @entity1 ballot , although two of them -- @entity62 and former @entity99 gov. @entity98 -- skipped the contest			1
@entity98 is avoiding the @entity1 caucuses completely , while @entity62 's advisers are carefully watching the state and could pounce in the coming months if they see an opening			1
former house speaker @entity105 was on the ballot , too , but his cash - strapped campaign did not have a formal presence at the straw poll and he only got 385 votes			1
@entity112 rep. @entity111 shelled out thousands of dollars to reserve campaign space outside the straw poll venue , but -- while he played up the perils of " big government " and of ceding " the 21st century ( to ) @entity116 " -- he was not , as expected , a major factor , securing a mere 35 votes			1
@entity3 had been positioned at or near the top of most @entity1 polls thanks to the passions she has stirred among tea party activists and social conservatives who make up a large part of the caucus electorate			1
but there are questions about how strong her organization in the state is and whether she can compete with @entity34 's respectable ground game			2
like @entity132 in 2007 , though , @entity3 has a natural appeal to evangelicals and home - school activists who tend to show up at political events like straw polls			1
in her speech in @entity0 on saturday , @entity3 exuded optimism -- proudly and loudly insisting , " we are the team that ca n't be beat			1
" besides playing up her roots in @entity1 , where she was raised , the three - term @entity143 representative cast herself as a fiscal conservative and " national security conservative			1
" still , some of the most impassioned parts of her speech dealt with her stances on social issues			0
" we are social conservatives , and we will never be ashamed of being social conservatives , " @entity3 said			0
" we understand that religious liberty is the essence of the foothold of this nation			0
" another candidate who came in with high expectations was @entity31 , given his strong performances in straw polls at various conservative gatherings over the years			2
such successes are a testament to the devotion of his libertarian - leaning followers and their ability to outorganize and outhustle the competition			0
but these days , political observers and members of the media take his straw poll wins for granted			1
and these victories have yet to translate to larger ones for the now three - time presidential candidate -- who has n't broken through yet in @entity7 elections nationally			2
speaking saturday , @entity31 called for fewer government regulations and more " freedom for @entity143			0
" " @entity181 and life does not come from the government , " he said			0
" it comes from our creator			0
" as much as the vote -- a fund - raiser for the @entity190 -- could catapault some candidates , it may also eliminate those who have staked their candidacies on @entity1 but struggled to generate grassroots enthusiasm			1
they included @entity57 , who acknowledged his underdog status but promised a comeback			0
" this is the little - engine - that - could campaign , " the staunch social conservative said			0
" they told us we had no chance			0
" @entity60 , a businessman and former radio host running on his outsider image , is fading after a strong early start to the campaign			0
he had tried to manage expectations for the straw poll , but recently told a @entity208 audience that he needs to finish in the top three			1
anything less , he said , would compel him to " evaluate " his campaign			0
in a raucous address saturday , @entity60 ran through his positions on a host of economic , foreign policy and other matters while saying @entity143 " are ready to embrace a problem - solver and not another politician			0
" referring to an epiphany he had 12 years ago after his first grandchild was born , " i had to use my talents , skills and abilities to do something about this nation and get it off the wrong track , " @entity60 said			0
" this giant has awakened and is not going back to sleep			0
" @entity34 's performance in the poll was seen as especially critical			2
observers had said he must finish in first or second place and send a message to his supporters ( and the media ) that his campaign can soldier on through the fall and winter			2
the former @entity4 governor has a platoon of smart political operatives in his corner and is thought to have the best ground game in the state			2
but despite planting an early flag in @entity1 and improving his performance on the stump in recent weeks , the @entity244 remains stuck in single - digits in state polls			1
on saturday , he echoed many others in blasting president @entity15 , claiming he " has no clue " and saying " he is like a manure spreader in a wind storm			0
" @entity34 also vowed that his ability to get re-elected in @entity4 shows he has the track record to succeed in governing and also win over swing voters			0
" i do n't just talk about it			0
we got the job done , for @entity4 and @entity143 , " he said			0
the results of the @entity1 straw poll will be carefully scrutinized by political analysts , helping propel some candidates in their fundraising and campaign efforts elsewhere even as it deflates others			1
@entity1 gov. @entity272 , a veteran observer of @entity7 politics in the state , said it is critical that a candidate do well if they are to have any chance , down the line			1
" if you 're not in the top three here , your chances of getting elected are not very good , " he said			2
but history shows a straw poll win hardly guarantees future success in the state or nationwide			1
in 2007 , @entity289 gov. @entity62 won the vote , but his closest rival in the state , former @entity293 gov. @entity132 , ultimately won the @entity1 caucuses and dealt a fatal blow to @entity62 's candidacy			1
the @entity7 nominee that year , meanwhile , was @entity299 sen. @entity298			2
only one @entity7 has won the straw poll and gone on to occupy the @entity301 : @entity302 .			1

new : the congresswoman thanks her supporters , saying the vote " sent a message "
candidates earlier made their pitches for nonbinding votes at the event in @entity0 , @entity1
the @entity1 straw poll is the first major gathering of @entity7 in the first caucus state
