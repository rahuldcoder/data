@entity0 , @entity1 -- former @entity1 president @entity4 has been placed under house arrest , @entity1 media reported thursday			1
the @entity1 government said earlier thursday it would obey an order by @entity0 's @entity8 to arrest @entity4 , @entity1 's interim minister of information @entity9 said			1
the order is legally binding , said @entity9 , who is acting as a spokesman for the government			0
the government had to act within 24 hours of the high court decision or face contempt of court charges			0
local tv stations earlier showed police entering his villa compound , where @entity4 went after being quickly ushered from the court by his private security detail			1
the arrest order was made at the same time the court rejected @entity4 's request for a bail extension in a case he is facing over the detention of judges in 2007			1
the ruling set the stage for his arrest and has further undermined his political ambitions			0
@entity4 's office called the @entity0 court 's decision " unwarranted judicial activism " that was " seemingly motivated by personal vendettas , " and said it would appeal against it at the @entity35			1
but @entity38 , one of @entity4 's attorneys , told local tv reporters that they had arrived at the court too late in the day and that the @entity35 refused to accept the appeal			1
@entity38 said @entity4 's legal team would seek to file the appeal friday instead , local tv stations reported			1
since @entity4 's court appearance thursday , his spokespeople have given contradictory statements about his legal status			1
@entity4 remains in his @entity0 home			2
meanwhile , the @entity50 issued a ruling calling the inspector general of @entity0 police to court friday to explain why his officers did not arrest @entity4 in court thursday as instructed			1
the high court ruling asks the inspector what precise steps police took to arrest @entity4			1
the ruling also says that when @entity4 allegedly ordered the house arrest of senior judges in 2007 , it was an " act of terrorism " to prevent the judges from doing their job			2
@entity4 halted from running for parliament , lawyer says return from exile @entity4 resigned as president of the @entity72 nation five years ago and went into exile in @entity74 and @entity75			1
he returned to @entity1 under heavy security to contest three court cases against him and run in upcoming elections			1
but so far , his return does not seem to be going according to plan			0
this week , @entity1 election officials barred @entity4 from running for a seat in parliament , a decision his lawyer has said he will challenge in the @entity35			1
that decision appears to have emboldened members of the judiciary , many of whom have bitter memories of their treatment by @entity4 during his time in power			2
the rejection of bail thursday came in a case in which @entity4 faces accusations that he illegally imposed house arrest on senior judges during a period of emergency rule he imposed six years ago			2
it was n't immediately clear how the high court 's ruling would play out			2
@entity1 authorities also have an inconsistent track record in enforcing court decisions against prominent figures			2
a january court order for the arrest of prime minister @entity111 in connection with a long - running corruption case has yet to be carried out			0
no former @entity1 army chief has been arrested before , and former presidents have only ever been placed under house arrest , never sent to jail			1
when asked last week about his fears of arrest , @entity4 brushed the question aside			0
he had previously received bail extensions in the cases concerning him			0
and he was initially granted " protective " bail to ward off potential arrest when he returned to @entity1			1
but the judiciary appears to have taken a more aggressive line than he may have expected , stepping up the pursuit of cases against him			0
@entity4 : ' there is no case against me ' accusations over @entity133 besides the case concerning the detention of the judges , @entity4 is also accused separately of not doing enough to protect the life of @entity133 , the first woman to be elected prime minister of @entity1			1
a leading member of the opposition , she was assassinated on december 27 , 2007 , after leaving a campaign rally in @entity143 , just two weeks before the general election in which she hoped to be returned to office			0
in another case , he is charged with ordering his troops to kill @entity149 , a popular tribal leader in the volatile province of @entity151 , in 2006			0
@entity4 was disqualified from contesting elections in @entity1 because of the state of emergency he declared in 2007			1
even though he has n't been tried for that action , the move was ruled an act of treason , making him ineligible to run for office			2
@entity4 maintains he should not be barred because he has not been convicted of any criminal acts			0
some @entity1 are happy to see the return of the ex-military ruler , hoping his leadership could help restore order to a country riddled with political division and plagued by extremist violence			0
but he also made many enemies in the final years of his presidency , notably among the judges he detained			0
the @entity1 @entity170 vowed to send a death squad to hunt down the former president if he returned to the country			2
@entity4 has said he has been living under threats of death since september 11 , 2001 , when he supported the @entity177 war on terror and fought against the @entity170			0
the former general became president after a bloodless coup in 1999			0
@entity4 's popularity began declining in 2007 after he suspended the nation 's @entity35 chief justice for " misuse of authority			1
" the move resulted in protests and accusations that he was attempting to influence the court 's ruling on whether he could seek another five - year term			0
