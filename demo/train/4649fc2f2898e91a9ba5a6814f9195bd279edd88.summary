for three months , they 've staked their claim to @entity3 's @entity2 , or @entity2 , and to @entity4 itself			1
we will leave only when you pull closer to the @entity9 , when you change the constitution , when you alter the government 's power structure , they have loudly insisted			1
but why ? why have thousands of protesters staked their lives , seemingly , on their desire for political change ? and why has the government resisted their calls so vehemently ? let 's take a look : 1			1
what prompted the protests ? at the heart of the protests is a trade pact			1
for a year , president @entity26 insisted he was intent on signing a historical political and trade agreement with the @entity9			1
but on november 21 , he decided to suspend talks with the @entity9			1
what would the pact have done ? the deal , the @entity9 's " @entity31 , " would have created closer political ties and generated economic growth			1
it would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion , supporters of the pact said			1
why did @entity26 backpedal ? he had his reasons			2
chief among them was @entity45 's opposition to it			1
@entity45 threatened its much smaller neighbor with trade sanctions and steep gas bills if @entity4 forged ahead			1
if @entity4 did n't , and instead joined a @entity50 - led @entity49 , it would get deep discounts on natural gas , @entity45 said			1
were there any other reasons ? yes , a more personal one			0
@entity26 also was facing a key @entity9 demand that he was unwilling to meet : free former prime minister @entity56 , his bitter political opponent			1
two years ago , she was found guilty of abuse of office in a @entity45 gas deal and sentenced to seven years in prison , in a case widely seen as politically motivated			1
her supporters say she needs to travel abroad for medical treatment			0
what happened next ? many @entity4 were outraged			1
they took to the streets , demanding that @entity26 sign the @entity9 deal			1
the demonstrations drew parallels to @entity4 's 2004 @entity72 , which booted @entity26 , then a prime minister , from office			1
who 's heading the opposition ? it 's not just one figure , but a coalition			1
the best known figure is @entity81			0
he 's a former world champion boxer ( just like his brother @entity82 )			2
@entity81 heads the @entity84 party			0
but the oppositon bloc goes well beyond @entity81 and the @entity84			0
( more on him later			0
how did @entity26 react ? in a way that inflamed passions further			0
he flew to @entity50 , where he and @entity45 president @entity90 announced @entity45 would buy $ 15 billion in @entity4 debt and slash the price @entity3 pays for its gas			1
and then , when the demonstrations showed no signs of dying down , he adopted a sweepting anti-protest law			0
what did the anti-protest law say ? the law barred people from wearing helmets and masks to rallies and from setting up tents or sound equipment without prior police permission			0
this sparked concerns it could be used to put down demonstrations and deny people the right to free speech -- and clashes soon escalated			0
the demonstrators took over @entity117 for the better part of three months			0
but was n't the law repealed ? yes , ultimately it was			0
amid intense pressure , deputies loyal to @entity26 backtracked and overturned it			0
but by then , the protests had become about something much bigger : constitutional reform			2
what change in the constitution did they want to see ? the protesters want to see a change in the government 's overall power structure			1
they feel that too much power rests with @entity26 and not enough with parliament			2
what did the government do ? in late january , the president offered a package of concessions under which @entity87 , the opposition leader , would have become the prime minister and , under the president 's offer , been able to dismiss the government			1
he also offered @entity81 the post of deputy prime minister on humanitarian issues			0
he also agreed to a working group looking at changes to the constitution			0
why did the opposition pass on the offer ? the concessions were n't enough to satisfy them			2
they said @entity26 had hardly loosened his grip on the government , nor had he seemingly reined in authorities ' approach to protesters			0
" we 're finishing what we started , " @entity87 said			0
but over the weekend , it seemed things were getting better , were n't they ? yes			0
on sunday , protesters vacated @entity3 's @entity117 , unblocked a major street and left other government buildings in exchange for the government dropping charges against those arrested			2
but any breakthrough was a distant memory by tuesday			0
why ? what happened tuesday ? the opposition wanted to introduce amendments in parliament that would have limited the president 's powers and restored the constitution to what it was in 2004			1
but the speaker of parliament refused to allow it			0
who was to blame for the clashes ? depends on whom you ask			0
the government pointed the finger at protesters			0
the opposition , in turn , blamed the government			2
regardless , it was the bloodiest day of protests up to that point ; 28 people died			2
was n't there a truce called ? yes , the government and opposition agreed on a truce late wednesday			2
but it barely took hold -- and blood was flowing again thursday			0
what caused the fresh clashes ? gunfire erupted thursday at @entity2 , or @entity2 , which has been ground zero for anti-government protesters			2
at least 20 people died			0
it 's unclear what prompted the gunfire			2
again , finger - pointing followed : the government said protesters broke the truce ; the protesters said the government did			0
so , what happens next ? top international diplomats have been trying to resolve the crisis			0
there 's also been talk of sanctions			2
will sanctions help ? analysts warn there 's little that outside pressure could do , especially if the @entity4 military gets involved on the side of the government			1
what 's the takeaway here ? street protests that started in november over a trade pact have swelled into something much bigger -- a demand that the president loosen his grip on power and the constitution be changed			1
as a result , the eastern @entity247 country is in the midst of a wave of anti-government protests , the likes of which it has n't seen in 10 years			1
there 's something else : @entity4 , the biggest frontier nation separating @entity45 and the @entity9 , is something of a pawn between @entity45 and the @entity258			1
the @entity9 and the @entity259 think @entity45 wields a lot of influence			1
one open - ended question is how much worse it will all get			0
" my own hunch , " said @entity263 , president of the @entity264 , " is this is going to continue to escalate			2

@entity4 has been *rattled* by anti-government protests since november
the trigger then was the president 's decision not to sign a trade pact with the @entity9
@entity4 is split : some want to align more with the @entity258 , others favor @entity45
the opposition has also pushed to shift power away from the president
