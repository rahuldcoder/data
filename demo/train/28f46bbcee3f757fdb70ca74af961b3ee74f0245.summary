-- in an update to one of the more iconic " year - end " magazine editions , @entity1 has launched a " @entity7 on @entity8 " campaign to complement its " @entity7 " issue , which hits newsstands later this month			1
for the campaign , @entity1 has chosen five celebs that are n't just " sexy " ( as defined by the editors , we presume ) , but also have a big presence in social media			2
notably , the @entity17 guy is on the list , as well as @entity19 ( who we 've long noted is disproportionately popular on @entity8 ) and @entity22 social media super user @entity21			2
@entity23 and " @entity24 's " @entity25 round out the five celebrities that @entity1 's @entity8 fans can vote for through november 10			1
the winner will be revealed in the " @entity7 " issue -- the 25th edition of the feature			0
while hardly the most innovative application , we imagine it will be a win for people -- which also recently launched its @entity36 app -- as its social media obsessed nominees encourage their fans to vote			0
who do you think should take the title ? let us know in the comments			0
