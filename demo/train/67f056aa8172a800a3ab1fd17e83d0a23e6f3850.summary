editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity5 ) -- walking through the jungle in the dead of night with a group of @entity22 rebels best known for their expertise at rape and murder was n't exactly what we had planned for our first trip to the @entity28			1
all we wanted was to make a little film about the controversy surrounding the so - called conflict minerals that make our cell phones work , drop a couple @entity35 references , and drink a @entity36			1
a week earlier , our team landed at @entity38 in the capital of @entity40 , formerly leopoldville			0
the place looks like it has n't had a scrub since @entity43 dropped by for the @entity44 in the early 1970s			0
after having our yellow - fever cards checked for the first time in our well - traveled lives , we ran a gauntlet of sweaty police officers and other officials -- each with his own laundry list of infractions that we had apparently already committed			2
in an amazing stroke of luck , they were willing to overlook all these violations for a small fine , payable in person , to them			0
see the rest of vice guide to @entity28 at @entity5 we 'd come to @entity28 to try to find out more about the developed world 's thirst for coltan , cassiterite , and the other colorfully named minerals that make the electronics industry go round			1
these are part of a group of natural resources that have been dubbed " conflict minerals " because of the alphabet soup of armed groups ( @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , etc. ) who have found them a very portable and highly profitable way to fund their activities -- which mostly consist of killing people			1
since 1996 , these guerrilla insurgencies have led to the deaths of more than 5 million people , and in one 12 - month period , the rape of approximately 400,000 women			1
we knew very little about @entity28 before we came , but the one thing that had been drilled into our heads was " do not fly on @entity28 airlines			2
" conventional wisdom says that between the beat - up @entity98 planes and their drunken @entity98 pilots , and the occasional crocodile in the overhead , if you fly a @entity28 airline -- you will die			2
but what else could we do ? walk ? this is a country the size of @entity106 , with the infrastructure of rural @entity108			0
as it turned out , that flight would be the most comfortable experience of the days that followed .			0

@entity5 travels to @entity28 to do film on so - called conflict minerals
@entity28 is rich in coltan and other minerals used to make cell phones and other electronics
armed groups use the profitable ore to fund their activities , which has led to millions of deaths
