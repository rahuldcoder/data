-- years from now , historians are likely to look back upon @entity3 's second inaugural address as a rich treasure trove for understanding his presidency and possibly the course of @entity8 politics			1
it was n't as important for his rise to power as his 2004 address to the @entity14			2
that one propelled him onto the national stage			0
it was n't as elegant as his @entity20 speech on race relations in the 2008 campaign			2
that one was his rhetorical masterpiece			0
but the second inaugural was far more important than either in defining his political philosophy as president			1
politics : after inauguration , political reality returns to @entity32 here 's a first rough draft of what historians may find significant : @entity3 revealed : the @entity3 who took the oath of office this week seemed not only more confident but also liberated			1
a central point of his address was that he inherited an economic crisis and two wars but now the nation is emerging into a clearing			0
this , he believes , is a golden opportunity for fresh action -- a moment to be seized			0
left unspoken were two other reasons why he feels liberated : he clearly thinks he has shown the country that @entity50 are n't willing to compromise , so that he has no choice but to try to muscle them			1
the @entity50 has now blinked twice on the fiscal cliff and the new debt ceiling ; he plans to make them keep blinking			2
then , too , @entity3 is also freed up because he is no longer working under the shadow of the 2010 midterm elections when he was snookered			2
after his convincing win in 2012 , he is back on top politically			0
opinion : @entity3 's ringing defense of liberalism all of this has inspired the president to reveal to the world his true political philosophy : in one speech , he gave the strongest embrace of 20th - century liberalism since @entity71 and the @entity72			1
yes , he gave a couple of bows to the importance of individual initiative and private enterprise , but the heart and soul of the address was a call to collective action on a wide array of fronts			0
gone were the third way of @entity86 and the centrism of @entity88			0
he emerged as an unapologetic , unabashed liberal -- just what the left has long wanted him to be and exactly what the right has feared			0
heir to @entity95 and @entity96 : a little more than three decades ago , @entity97 moved the inaugural ceremony from the east side of the @entity100 to the west			1
for @entity97 , the symbolism was that of a @entity103 who wanted to give his inaugural address gazing out across the @entity105 , the monuments and @entity107 toward the @entity108			0
but for @entity3 , the symbolism was very different : he was the president who looked west toward the monuments of @entity95 and the rev. @entity96 and his address artfully tied him to their legacy			1
the historian @entity113 won a @entity114 some years ago with his book on @entity116 in 1863			0
@entity113 argued that for most of @entity8 's early history , people thought that the republic was born with the @entity120 of 1787 and the @entity121 was a secondary document			2
opinion : anti-government era is over along came @entity95 at @entity125 saying that the country was born " four score and seven years ago " -- in 1776 with the declaration			2
in @entity113 ' view , now widely accepted , @entity95 at @entity125 turned the declaration 's second paragraph into the founding creed of the country			1
what we must aspire to , @entity95 was saying , was to ensure that all are created equal			2
@entity96 came to the @entity137 100 years later -- in 1963 -- to go back to @entity95 at @entity125 and through him to the declaration			1
the nation , @entity96 said , must live up to the promise of equal opportunity -- and indeed , that was the dream he so eloquently expressed in the finest @entity8 speech since @entity125			1
enter @entity3 at his second inaugural , not only on @entity96 's official holiday but 50 years after " @entity146 " and 150 years after @entity125			1
the president 's address begins with a recitation of the declaration , calls it our " founding creed " and makes the aspiration of equal opportunity the central goal of his presidency			2
in the past , presidents at inaugurations have found the nation 's heroes among those who have died in battle			0
@entity3 chose a different path : he found the nation 's heroes at @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168			2
his philosophy , as we learned , is not just about government programs but about embracing inclusion and diversity			2
it was , i believe , his firmest attempt to build upon @entity95 and @entity96 -- and in effect , his address made him their modern heir			1
opinion : @entity50 , play offense in @entity3 's second term setting a new course : a president 's inaugural address often sets the tone and direction of his next four years in office and nowhere may that be more true than with @entity3 's second			1
his assertive address has heartened his supporters so that they seem ready to march into battle with him			0
they not only want him to succeed , but they now have an ambitious agenda to embrace as well			0
@entity196 , the president 's team began putting together a new citizens group , @entity198 , just before the inauguration , and his speech was in effect a call to arms			2
whether " @entity198 " , as @entity204 in @entity32 already call it , will work well with the @entity204 is open to question , but it is clear that @entity3 & co. intend to use it as an important way to rally public pressure on @entity210 for his agenda			1
on the other side of the aisle , many @entity50 such as @entity212 were respectful of the president after his address but underneath most of them were bristling			1
they had expected the president to issue a ritualistic plea for bipartisanship and then to begin negotiating with them over federal deficits			0
instead , he made it clear that he will work with them as long as they agree with him and try to run over them if they resist			0
from the @entity50 perspective , @entity3 was virtually dismissive of the nation 's fiscal threats and was n't interested in true negotiations			1
in a tweet after the speech , scholar @entity231 captured their view of @entity3 's message to the @entity50 : " together , we shall pursue my objectives			1
" opinion : world to @entity3 -- you ca n't ignore us in short , the divisions in @entity32 may grow even deeper in the near term , if that is possible , and no one knows what will actually be accomplished			1
among partisans on both sides , there is still a sense that a piece of gun control can be passed ( starting with background checks ) and perhaps a larger piece of immigration ( starting with @entity257 visas and legal status for the undocumented )			0
but serious action on climate change seems distant			0
more centrally , the parties seem even further apart on a budget agreement			0
the @entity50 is in no mood to revisit higher taxes and the president 's address gave a ringing endorsement to the basic structure of @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272			1
in short , the road ahead looks even rockier than it seemed after the elections			0
on the day before the inaugural , a @entity276 article by @entity277 reported that after the first term , @entity3 has warned possible candidates for his job that it is very difficult to get things done in @entity32 and that the president has a " contracted sense of possibility			1
" he and his team are also aware that power seeps away quickly in a second term			0
how , one wondered , is it possible to reconcile those views with @entity3 's decision to go big at the inaugural , pushing an extraordinarily ambitious agenda			1
that question still lingers after the inauguration			0
it is just possible that what he was ultimately doing in his address was to present the country with a liberal vision of the future and a legislative agenda to go with it -- something akin to what @entity305 did in 1944			0
@entity305 left behind a @entity204 with a majority coalition and an agenda that drove @entity8 politics for more than 20 years			0
is that the legacy that @entity3 really wants to leave ? @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity305 -- all rolled into one ? only historians will know the answer for sure			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity316 .			2

@entity316 says historians will look on @entity3 's speech as an important source
@entity3 seemed liberated to express his philosophy of government , he says
@entity316 says the president stressed equality in the *tradition* of @entity95 , @entity96
he says @entity50 is bristling at the speech , and it will likely deepen divisions in @entity32
