-- with a fourth video released , @entity1 is now in full swing			1
the latest caught - on - tape remarks from economist @entity5 , one of the architects of the @entity7 , has him asserting back in 2010 that the " @entity10 public " -- that 's you and me -- " does n't actually care that much about the uninsured			1
" he thinks he knows us so well			2
in another video released earlier , he said that to pass new health care legislation , the @entity18 administration successfully relied on an electorate -- again , you and me -- that did n't really understand it			1
" it 's a very clever , you know , basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the @entity10 voter , " he tells the @entity23 2012 at the @entity24			2
there appears to be a bottomless well of @entity5 's greatest hits			1
in yet another , from a speech at the @entity34 in 2013 , he explains that the very function of the law -- doing what it was designed to do -- was totally unpalatable to voters ( that is , if only we 'd turned away from our @entity42 bags and @entity44 races long enough to catch it )			2
" if you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in -- if you made it explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money , it would not have passed			0
" to hammer the point home , he admits that the sales pitch was one big cover - up operation : " lack of transparency is a huge advantage			2
and basically , you know , call it the stupidity of the @entity10 voter or whatever			0
but basically that was really , really critical to getting the thing to pass			0
" and in still another video he 's caught telling @entity67 at @entity68 in 2013 that one important provision of the bill passed " because the @entity10 people are too stupid to understand the difference			1
" let 's be clear : @entity5 did n't say any of this incredibly arrogant , deeply offensive stuff in a soft whisper at a clandestine meeting of liberal donors			1
he said these things out loud , at lectures , over and over and over again , without even an attempt at discretion			2
these videos may seem inflammatory on their face			0
here 's an @entity18 adviser gleefully insisting that the administration hoodwinked the @entity10 people to pass legislation that otherwise very few would have wanted			0
but underneath all this arrogance and hubris is a surprising amount of willful ignorance about what actually happened to pass @entity7			1
it is n't that @entity5 thinks we 're all rubes			1
it 's that he thinks his team of brilliant economists and political spin - doctors were so clever they actually got away with something			2
that just is n't the case			0
for one , it was hardly a secret that the law relied on healthy people to pay in so that sick people would get coverage			0
most of us -- even the stupidest -- know that 's how insurance works			0
and just to be sure it was clear , @entity112 and opponents of the law reiterated this fact ad nauseam during the public debate of the @entity7			1
@entity119 , even @entity7 supporters were insistent on explaining this point for the express purpose of getting healthy people to sign up for it			1
the administration spent millions on a marketing pitch to convince young , healthy millennials to invest in health insurance many did n't appear to want			0
for another , despite @entity5 's insistence that the administration maintained a necessary opacity about the law , there were plenty of warnings about its potential fundamental problems , and numerous advocacy groups , impartial economists and media outlets were steadily fact - checking the president 's rosy predictions about the law			1
from them we heard it may not reduce the deficit by $ 1 trillion			0
we heard it would not reduce health care costs			0
we heard it would reduce the workforce by an equivalent of 2 million jobs			0
we heard premiums would rise			0
we heard we might not be able to keep our health plans after all			0
of course , only time will tell whether those warnings will bear out , but opponents of the legislation were making them back then , even though @entity5 believes the administration hid them so well , and were vocal about it			1
and to pretty clear results			0
according to @entity164 tracking polls of the legislation since 2010 , the law has never cracked a 51 % favorability rating , and has at times plummeted to the low 30s			0
another point : the @entity10 people never voted on @entity7 , so i 'm not sure what role @entity5 thinks the " stupid " electorate played in its passage			1
in fact , in the first election after the @entity7 passed , @entity112 who opposed the legislation retook the @entity179 and kicked 11 @entity180 out of state houses			1
@entity7 was n't a cleverly concealed mystery package that @entity180 slipped under the noses of an otherwise bumbling idiocracy			1
it was passed by a @entity180 majority that controlled both houses , without a single @entity112 vote , pushed through by a @entity189 that cared more about scoring a political victory than if the law would ever work as intended or if @entity10 would like it			0
@entity5 's misguided sense of accomplishment reflects not so much elitism as it does the arrogance of liberal " solutionism , " or the tendency of technocrats to assume they can solve complex social problems easily			1
technology scholar @entity201 , author of " to save everything , @entity203 : the @entity205 , " writes that " solutionists err by assuming , rather than investigating , the problems they set out to tackle			2
[ they ] do not limit themselves to fixing the problems of individuals ; they are as keen to fix the problems of institutions			2
" this kind of hubris explains why someone like @entity219 believes he can solve gun crime by banning guns or obesity by banning big sodas			0
and it 's why @entity5 believed he could solve our health care problems			1
it 's not because he actually wanted to understand the problem , but because he decided what the problem was ( in this case , that healthy people were paying too little for insurance ) and assumed we were all too dumb to ask any questions			2
but we asked plenty of questions			0
we are still asking questions			0
and legislators , economists and health care scholars will be trying to fix the mess that @entity5 et al created for many years to come			1
but when this legislation finally collapses under its own weight , @entity5 will no doubt find a way to blame stupid @entity10 for failing to properly implement his vision .			1
