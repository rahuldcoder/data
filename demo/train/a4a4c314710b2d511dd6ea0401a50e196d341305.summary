@entity0 -- @entity3 's first space laboratory module launched thursday , according to state - run media , an important milestone in @entity3 's plan to build a space station			1
@entity3 's @entity8 showed a picture of president @entity10 watching the launch of @entity12 at @entity13 along with @entity15 officials			2
@entity16 means " heavenly palace " in @entity3			1
it lifted off from the @entity19 in @entity20 , northwest @entity3			0
the module was on a carrier rocket , called the @entity23			0
the 8.5 - ton lab module is part of an experiment to test space rendezvous and docking capabilities , essential for the operation of a manned space platform			1
opinion : make @entity3 our new partner in space @entity35 , spokesperson for the @entity36 , told a press conference before the launch that the effective volume of the experiment module is about 15 cubic meters , which could potentially accommodate three astronauts			1
@entity12 was originally scheduled to launch at the end of august but was postponed after the failure of another satellite launch			0
when the module successfully enters its low @entity47 orbit , an unmanned spacecraft -- @entity49 - 8 -- will be sent into space to dock with it			0
the two spacecraft will fly for about 12 days after the first docking , before conducting another docking test at an appropriate time in flight , @entity8 reported			0
after the two tests , the @entity56 will return to @entity47 and the @entity12 will rise to its original orbit to wait for the next docking test			2
@entity3 sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 , the first stage in a " three - step " strategy to develop its manned engineering project			1
the launch of @entity12 is the second step			0
if successful , it will be followed by the last phase : to build a permanent space lab that will allow astronauts to conduct long - term space experiments			1
" it is of great significance for the realization of the three - step strategy of @entity36 and the promotion of sustainable development of manned space flight			1
according to @entity8 , @entity0 hopes to build a space station by around 2020			2
@entity3 is not part of the project that maintains the @entity82 ( @entity82 ) , which currently orbits the @entity47 conducting experiments in a range of fields , from physics to astronomy			0
the @entity82 is a joint venture between @entity89 , @entity91 's @entity90 space agency , @entity93 's @entity92 , the @entity94 and the @entity96 @entity95 .			0
