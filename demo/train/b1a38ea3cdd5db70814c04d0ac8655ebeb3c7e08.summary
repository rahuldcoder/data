-- " @entity1 ! " " @entity2 ! " " @entity3 is on the warpath ! " an @entity6 sousaphone player dotting the " i. " those are some of the things you 'll hear and see during college football 's biggest games this season			2
@entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity6 are the four universities voted into the inaugural @entity18 , the selection committee announced sunday			1
no. 1 @entity14 will play no. 4 @entity6 in the @entity21 , and no. 2 @entity15 will play no. 3 @entity16 in the @entity23			1
both games will take place on january 1 , and the winners will face off in the @entity27 on january 12			1
@entity29 playoff winners , losers after saturday 's games , @entity33 champion @entity14 and @entity34 champ @entity15 were entrenched in the top two slots , and @entity38 champion @entity16 had finished the season as the only undefeated team in the @entity41 , college football 's top tier			1
but there was plenty of controversy over which team should get the fourth and final spot			0
@entity6 got the nod after stomping the @entity50 59 - 0 in the @entity52 championship game			1
here 's what you wo n't hear : any cheers from fans of @entity58 or @entity60 universities			1
one of the five major football conferences -- the @entity62 -- was left out of the playoff picture			2
its conference co-champions , @entity58 and @entity60 , finished fifth and sixth in the final rankings , respectively			1
@entity60 dropped from third last week to sixth , despite defeating @entity67 decisively , 55 - 3 , on saturday			2
@entity58 also won on saturday , and had beaten @entity60 by a field goal , 61 - 58 , earlier in the year			1
within minutes of the selection committee releasing its final rankings , @entity58 and @entity60 partisans flooded @entity72 with outrage			1
. ironically , the new @entity18 was devised to eliminate controversy over who gets to play for the national championship			0
into the 1990s , conferences were aligned with specific bowl games ( for instance , the @entity33 champion played in the @entity21 each year ) , and no. 1 rarely met no. 2 at year 's end , sometimes leading to a split decision between the two main polls , @entity85 and @entity86 , as far as who was no. 1			0
but starting in the 1990s , various incarnations of what came to be known as the @entity90 attempted to pit the top two teams in the country in a winner - takes - all finale			0
the overall rankings were compiled using a combination of human - and computer - generated rankings			0
while the game featured the no. 1 @entity90 - ranked team versus the no. 2 team every year since 1998 , often debate raged regarding whether those were actually the two best teams			0
this october , for the first time , a panel of 13 people -- including former coaches , players and university administrators -- started meeting once a week to winnow down the field to the @entity111			0
while many fans praised the new system for giving two more teams a shot at a national title , the @entity117 , the governing body behind collegiate athletics in the @entity120 , acknowledged on its website that there " almost always will be more than one correct answer			0
" many sports pundits have called for an eight - team playoff			0
it 's safe to assume @entity58 and @entity60 fans would agree , though it 's too late for this season			2
@entity72 reacts to playoff choices @entity0 's @entity131 and @entity132 contributed to this report			0

in the *semifinals* on january 1 : @entity14 **vs.** @entity6 and @entity15 **vs.** @entity16
controversy *swirls* as @entity58 and @entity60 miss out
@entity6 jumped into the @entity111 by drubbing @entity50 in the @entity52 championship game
@entity62 is the only one of the five " power conferences " not to be in a championship game
