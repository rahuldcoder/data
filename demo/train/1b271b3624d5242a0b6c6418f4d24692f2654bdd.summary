-- @entity1 , @entity2 's capital from 794 to 1868 , is one of the biggest stars on the @entity2 tourism trail , recently voted " world 's best city " by @entity7 readers			2
is it deserving of the title ? definitely			0
unless you 're a traveler under the age of 12 and do n't give a hoot about learning the correct way to whisk a bowl of matcha green tea , exploring ancient @entity18 or counting how many torii gates there are at the @entity21 ( 10,000 , for the record )			0
when traveling to @entity27 with kids , the mutinous cries of " not another zen garden , dad ! " will inevitably ring out , threatening to derail that dream family vacation			1
this is when you need to hit the @entity30 -- or @entity31 -- and spend an afternoon geeking out on some of the most familiar icons of @entity2 pop culture , from samurais and geisha to " @entity36 " and " @entity37			1
" ' the @entity38 of @entity2 ' first , you 'll need to toss your @entity39 fantasies out the sliding shoji screen door			1
there are no rides here			0
this theme park celebrates the best of @entity2 film - making , filled with huge @entity46 - period ( 1600 - 1867 ) sets you can explore on foot -- preferably decked out in a funny samurai - style wig you rented in the costume shop near the entrance			1
often overshadowed by its traditional cultural allures , @entity27 was called the " @entity38 " between the 1920s and 1960s , until its thriving film industry went into decline			1
in response , film - making leader @entity27 opened up parts of its sets to the public in 1975			1
further development followed and the theme park grew in popularity among tourists			0
today , many of @entity2 's " jidaigeki " period dramas are still filmed on these sets			2
on my recent weekday visit to the @entity30 , crowds were light and no tv shoots were taking place , but i was able to get a behind - the - scenes sample of what happens on a typical @entity2 historical drama shoot at the park 's @entity76			1
more relevant to most foreign visitors , however , is the @entity79 , filled with impressive displays , pictures and cells from shows produced by the @entity31 film company 's animation arm , including " @entity86 , " " @entity37 , " " @entity36 " and " @entity87 , " on which the @entity88 based its popular " @entity90 " series			1
in addition to @entity93 's dozens of film - related displays , the park has live ninja and samurai shows , a @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , 3d theater , maze of illusions , science museum , indoor kids play areas and a lovely @entity2 " ukiyo - e " woodcut print gallery			1
haunting , but not horrifying given that the @entity31 film company is behind some pretty terrifying horror flicks , as well as the controversial cult classic " @entity110 , " i expect something a bit more grotesque than what awaited in the @entity98			0
still , it 's pretty darn scary , in a slightly cheesy way			2
the sound effects alone left me fighting an urge to seek out an emergency " chicken " exit as i hissed aloud , " why did i come in here ? " ( @entity120 deleted			0
) an actor , playing the role of a bloodied " dead " body , popped up in silent reply			0
next , bearing in mind the words of author @entity129 -- " ninjas do n't wish upon a star , they throw them " -- i eagerly hit the @entity99 , where staff conducted a quick primer on the history of the cloaked assassins ' residences before setting me free to get out of a fun maze of false walls and doors			0
alas , no ninja stars were thrown			2
over in the @entity100 , quirky 3d anamorphic art and props made for a perfectly @entity144 experience			0
as i was traveling solo , a staff member was kind enough to accompany me through the space and take photos with my camera , doing a fine job of stifling her cringes as i struck awkward , unconvincing poses			0
though few would likely make a special trip to @entity27 to see the @entity155 , it 's definitely a kitschy and fun way to spend a few hours			1
buy the kids a souvenir ninja costume with their own set of throwing stars and you might even earn yourself an extra day of zen garden exploration			2
additional @entity164 information many of the shows are presented in @entity2 only , but inasmuch as they 're highly visual , they 're still worth watching			2
park displays include @entity169 text , while staff give out @entity169 - language maps at the entrance			2
@entity30 has multiple restaurants throughout , which serve @entity2 , @entity175 and @entity176 cuisine			1
admission is 2,200 yen ( $ 21 ) for adults			0
some attractions require an additional charge			0
@entity30 , @entity181 , 10 @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity27 ; +81 ( 0 ) 75 864 7716 @entity0 's series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile			1
however , @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0
