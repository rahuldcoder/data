@entity2 @entity1 leadership is standing by rep. @entity3 , the no. 3 - ranking @entity2 @entity1 , in the wake of a firestorm of criticism surrounding his 2002 speech to a white supremacist group			1
@entity3 's position as @entity2 majority whip has been thrown into doubt by the revelation , and the congressman had been calling members to gauge the level of support he had from his party , according to a senior @entity2 @entity1 source			1
but @entity2 speaker @entity20 , in a statement issued tuesday afternoon , said @entity3 has his " full confidence " as whip			1
" more than a decade ago , representative @entity3 made an error in judgment , and he was right to acknowledge it was wrong and inappropriate			1
like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle , i know @entity3 to be a man of high integrity and good character			1
he has my full confidence as our whip , and he will continue to do great and important work for all @entity38 , " he said			0
his message came shortly before a similar message of support from @entity2 majority leader @entity42			1
the controversy surrounding @entity3 's address to a group founded by former grand wizard of the @entity48 @entity47 had become a major distraction for @entity20 and his leadership team since the story drew national attention on monday			1
the fallout : what you need to know in a statement issued tuesday , @entity3 said he spoke to the group while he was barnstorming the district to build support for a piece of legislation — and that speaking to them was a " mistake i regret			1
" " one of the many groups that i spoke to regarding this critical legislation was a group whose views i wholeheartedly condemn			0
it was a mistake i regret , and i emphatically oppose the divisive racial and religious views groups like these hold , " he said in the statement			0
" i am very disappointed that anyone would try to infer otherwise for political gain , " he added , and decried the group 's " hateful bigotry			0
" the statement did not address how much @entity3 knew about the group at the time of the speech			1
@entity47 himself has said he does n't know @entity84			0
@entity86 's former campaign manager , who said he organized the event , also said the congressman likely was n't aware of the controversial history of his group			0
however , a @entity92 report from 1999 suggests @entity3 knew @entity86 well , and was critical of his beliefs			1
at that time , both were considered potential contenders in a @entity2 special election , and @entity3 panned him in comments to the paper			1
" the novelty of @entity47 has worn off , " @entity3 said			1
" the voters in this district are smart enough to realize that they need to get behind someone who not only believes in the issues they care about , but also can get elected			0
@entity86 has proven that he ca n't get elected , and that 's the first and most important thing			0
" in a coordinated move tuesday , @entity20 and @entity42 issued statements supporting @entity108 within minutes of @entity3 's new statement			1
there was frustration , according to the aides , that @entity3 's initial statement , in which he blamed sloppy staff work for his appearance before the group in 2002 , made it appear he was n't taking full responsibility for the incident and moving to get it passed him			1
it is unclear at this point how much blowback @entity3 will get from rank - and - file republicans , and that might now be fully visible until lawmakers return to work next week after digesting the unfolding situation			2
while the only public expressions from @entity1 to this point have been supportive , the aides predicted @entity3 still needs to work hard in the days ahead to maintain the confidence of his colleagues			1
critics of @entity3 have been bipartisan , but so have his defenders			2
he 's received strong support from @entity136 politicians , with @entity138 rep. @entity137 — the state 's only @entity139 @entity2 member — defending him from charges of racism			1
" i do n't think @entity3 has a racist bone in his body , " @entity137 told the @entity143			2
" @entity3 and i have worked on issues that benefit poor people , black people , white people , @entity152 people			2
" but national @entity139 have pounced on the episode , and as @entity20 remained silent on the issue for most of tuesday , ramped pressure on @entity2 @entity1 leadership to weigh in @entity2 minority leader @entity159 's spokesman , @entity158 , said the news of @entity3 's speech is " deeply troubling " for a @entity1 leader , but also declared that " actions [ of the @entity2 @entity1 caucus ] speak louder than whatever " @entity3 said during the forum			1
" just this year , @entity2 @entity1 have refused to restore the @entity166 or pass comprehensive immigration reform , and leading @entity1 members are now actively supporting in the federal courts efforts by another known extremist group , the @entity170 , which is seeking to overturn the president 's immigration executive actions , " he said in a statement			1
the @entity173 issued a scathing statement charging @entity3 " chose to cheerlead for a group of @entity48 members and neo-nazis at a white supremacist rally " and slamming @entity2 leadership for their silence on the development			1
" while @entity47 defends @entity3 , @entity20 and @entity183 are refusing to condemn @entity3 's choice of allies , " said @entity173 national press secretary @entity182			1
@entity182 said the incident made it " clear their leadership has a history of embracing anti-semitic , racist hate groups			0
" according to an agenda for the event and notes attendees posted afterward , @entity3 appeared at the @entity194 on @entity195 , a white nationalist organization founded by @entity47 , a former grand wizard of the @entity48			2
the appearance was first reported on sunday on @entity197 , a @entity136 politics blog run by @entity199 but @entity3 vehemently disavowed the group 's beliefs in his interview with the @entity143 , and said he " spoke to any group that called " — comparing it , as an example , to the @entity205 , a nonpartisan group known for helping to register new voters			1
" when you look at the kind of things they stand for , i detest these kinds of views			0
as a @entity213 , i think some of the things they profess target people like me			0
at lot of their views run contradictory to the way i run my life , " @entity3 added			2
@entity3 also suggested the appearance was in part due to staffing issues			2
" i had one person that was working for me			0
when someone called and asked me to speak , i would go			0
i was , in no way , affiliated with that group or the other groups i was talking to			0
" @entity230 has learned that the staffer at the time was @entity233 , who currently holds @entity3 's former state house seat			1
@entity233 rushed @entity230 off the phone monday night and declined to discuss the situation , but did not deny his work for the congressman			0
@entity233 's brother , @entity239 , is @entity3 's current chief of staff			1
neither responded to requests for comment on tuesday			0
the controversy comes just days before @entity1 take full control of @entity245 with @entity84 poised to play a key role in shepherding through conservatives ' legislative priorities			2
but even conservatives have expressed frustration with @entity3 , who they believe has n't stood strong on their priorities — pointing most recently to his vote for the government funding measure that drew heavy opposition from conservatives because it did n't address president @entity258 's immigration executive action			1
some , however , expressed support for him tuesday			0
@entity260 , the former @entity261 candidate backed by the @entity262 , has been named as a potential primary challenger to @entity3 but backed him in a statement to @entity230			2
" as congressman @entity3 has already conceded - attending this event was a mistake			2
i think we are all currently taking him at his word that this was an isolated incident that happened some 12 years ago , " @entity260 said			0
he added that if that 's true , " this is clearly an orchestrated attack designed to distract " from the real issues , including " fighting back against president @entity258 's executive amnesty , correcting a weak and feckless @entity274 and stopping the massive expansion of government growth and spending			0
" more broadly , however , the establishment silence has infuriated conservatives still smarting over their loss in the @entity283 race , when their chosen candidate , state sen. @entity284 , was narrowly defeated by sen. @entity285 after establishment @entity1 lodged racially - charged attacks against him			2
@entity284 came under heavy fire from establishment @entity1 for being billed as a headliner for a rally alongside a white nationalist , though he never ultimately attended the rally			2
in an email to @entity230 , @entity284 said that " of course there is a double standard for the @entity1 establishment			2
" he noted that former @entity305 gov. @entity304 " has a long history of despicable comments , some of them overtly racist , " pointing to a @entity303 article outlining some of the more salacious			0
" and yet , he receives a free pass from establishment politicians because of his perceived influence			0
all the while , others are forever tarnished for less serious deeds , " @entity284 said			0
he added : " the establishment wings of both parties are more hypocritical than fair , seeking to crush anyone -- friend and foe alike -- who would threaten their hold on power			0
" politicians in @entity3 's home state of @entity136 rallied to his defense on monday , however , saying they do n't believe he agrees with the white supremacist group 's ideology			1
" i know congressman @entity3 to be a good man who is fair - minded and kindhearted			0
i 'm confident he absolutely rejects racism in all its forms , " @entity136 gov. @entity325 said in a statement			0
but @entity3 's alleged appearance at the event drew a harsh rebuke from @entity333 , the conservative @entity334 blogger and former @entity136 resident who asked of the congressman : " how do you not know ? how do you not investigate ? " " how the hell does somebody show up at a @entity47 organized event in 2002 and claim ignorance ? " @entity333 wrote in a post monday			1
he said @entity342 -- the former @entity261 majority leader who was driven from his post after praising @entity345 's 1948 segregationist presidential campaign -- lost his gig " for something less than this " in 2001			0
and he pointed to @entity1 who hit @entity283 candidate @entity284 in 2014 for attending events hosted by the @entity350 and for making plans to attend a rally where he was billed along with a white nationalist .			0
