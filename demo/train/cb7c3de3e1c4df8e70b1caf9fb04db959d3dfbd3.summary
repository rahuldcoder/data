you want it desperately , but you do n't even know what it is			0
such is consumer desire for @entity9 data connectivity in mobile handsets			2
call it proof positive that the phone carriers ' marketing efforts have paid off -- this despite slow 4g infrastructure roll - outs , and actual @entity9 data rates that fall far , far below the promise of the @entity9 spec. in - @entity19 , a market research firm , recently announced that 75 % of more than 1,200 surveyed consumers listed @entity9 as one of the features that an " ideal " phone would include			1
the survey also found that most consumers do n't know which carrier offers the fastest 4g speeds -- immediately begging the question , " would a consumer even recognize a @entity9 connection if it hit him or her in face ? " @entity9 is definitely a relevant smartphone feature			1
but the disparity between consumer knowledge and consumer desire is troubling , and may stem from the way that @entity9 technology is being advertised			2
4g networks are currently underdeveloped , but carriers have been strongly pushing their networks nonetheless			1
and although carriers are marketing their 4g networks and 4g handset offerings nationwide , the actual availability of 4g services varies widely			1
for example , @entity49 's brand - new lte network is only available in five urban markets ( though the carrier does plan to cover 80 % of the populace by 2013 )			1
@entity54 's @entity48 , which currently features the fastest network speeds in the @entity56 , covers 88 markets			1
it 's a large number , yes , but @entity54 's @entity48 network is available to just 110 of the nation 's estimated 307 million people			1
that 's around 33 % of the @entity56 population , a far cry from the reported 75 % who crave a @entity9 device			1
@entity67 has compiled a useful chart of @entity56 markets that are supported by at least one @entity9 provider			2
coverage looks substantial at first glance , but for those in more rural areas -- or even metropolitan locales like @entity77 , which suffers extremely spotty coverage -- reliable @entity9 access is still a few years away			2
and spotty coverage is n't the only factor contributing to consumer confusion			0
get this : a significant portion of people who own a 3g device mistakenly think they have @entity9 hardware			2
a july survey by @entity87 found that an astonishing 34 % of @entity89 owners thought they had a @entity9 phone			1
these customers were probably confused by their @entity89 's " 4â € ³ designation , as well as the fact that the official definition of @entity9 is a moving target , and @entity96 has claimed " 4g - like " speeds			1
but @entity89 owners are n't alone in their misconceptions			0
in that same @entity87 survey , a quarter of @entity102 owners thought they had a 4g phone , when at the time of the study , there was no @entity102 handset yet available ! " to be quite frank , there is no definition for what @entity9 is , " @entity110 analyst @entity109 says			1
" most lte networks are pretty new , and there 's not much to compare it to			2
" this leads to even more confusion , particularly regarding what levels of speed users should be expecting from @entity121 ( which we 'll get into soon )			0
regardless , carriers have successfully managed to brand the term " 4g " into our brains through successful advertising techniques			2
" the industry has done a great job of associating @entity9 with the things a customer wants to do , but have n't been able to accomplish with @entity134 , " @entity129 analyst @entity128 says			2
those things include real - time gaming , streaming video and the ability to make video calls			0
" marketing has focused on what you can do with it , rather than on technology for the sake of technology , " @entity128 says			0
this approach stands in stark contrast to the confused messaging of @entity134 rollout campaigns , circa 2008			0
back then , carriers touted improved data speeds , but many consumers did n't understand what those data rates could be used for -- completely understandable considering the relatively small installed base of smartphones in that quaint era of feature phones			0
today , a boatload of @entity9 phones are now available , with new ones popping up with increasing frequency			0
this morning , @entity49 announced its first two lte handsets , the @entity166 and @entity167			0
the @entity167 has a 4.5 - inch , 540 x 960 display and a dual - core 1.2 @entity170 processor			0
the skyrocket is @entity49 's version of the popular @entity166 , which has a 4.5 - inch , 480 x 800 @entity175 display , and a 1.5 @entity177 chip			1
both run @entity180 2.3 ( @entity179 ) and will be available nov. 6			0
with consumers clamoring for @entity9 handsets , carriers must be able to follow through with their 4g promises -- and that means improving on two key 3g performance pain points : throughput and latency			1
throughput is the spec everyone usually talks about			0
measured in bits per second ( or megabits per second in the case of @entity9 ) , this spec describes just how much data can be sent through a carrier 's network in a fixed time period -- that is , a second			1
this number refers to pure network speed -- and everyone wants speedier data service , hence everyone 's preoccupation with throughput			0
@entity205 , meanwhile , describes the time delay between when a mobile device " pings " a network and when that network actually responds			0
high - latency networks cause a host of problems -- most significantly , streaming video that stutters along in fits and starts			0
when network latency is low , however , real - time applications like video chat really begin to sing			0
bottom line : even if you 've got the fastest throughput imaginable , high latency levels will prevent you from enjoying video calls and and other types of streaming video			0
current 4g throughput speeds -- whether you 're talking about @entity48 , @entity229 or the not - quite - @entity230 + -- are definitely slower than what could be theoretically accomplished , but @entity128 says that will always be the case			1
the theoretical speeds of 21 @entity235 for @entity230 + and 70 mbps for @entity48 could only be achieved in absolutely ideal conditions ( for example , if you 're standing right next to a cellphone tower , or you 're the only one using the network )			1
but that 's ok , as carriers are n't even saying they can achieve these spec - topping speeds			2
on @entity244 's wimax network , you 're promised 3 - to 6 - @entity235 download speeds ; on @entity54 's @entity48 , 5 - to 12 - @entity235 download speeds ; and with @entity230 + , 5 - to 10 - @entity235 download speeds ( @entity49 specifies 6 mbps )			1
all of these real - world numbers fall far short of @entity9 's theoretical benchmarks			1
but do n't stress out			0
as long as consumers know what they 're really getting , they can make the informed decision to upgrade to a 4g phone and network			1
