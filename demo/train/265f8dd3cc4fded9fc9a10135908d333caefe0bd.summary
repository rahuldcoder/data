@entity0 -- he is the face of @entity3 35 - year - old @entity4 , founder of mobile social gaming network @entity5 , is the world 's second youngest self - made billionaire behind @entity10 's @entity9			1
the similarities do n't end there			2
@entity4 , son of a @entity14 salaryman , launched @entity5 initially as a social network in @entity14 before moving into mobile social gaming			1
i caught up with him at his hq in the @entity19 in downtown @entity0 , one of the most desirable business addresses in the city			2
@entity14 's ' @entity9 ' leads new wave of entrepreneurs he may be flying high , but philosophically he remains down to earth , from the tips of his shaggy hair to the soles of his bright red crocs			1
what do you think when you 're compared to @entity9 ? i started my business in 2004 and @entity10 also started around 2004			1
@entity10 became such a big company and i think they are doing well in how they are changing society			1
i think we ( @entity5 ) can change society in that way too , so i want to continue making a challenge			1
how would you like to change @entity14 society ? we should change the way of thinking in the whole of @entity14			2
to do that , rather than by saying , " we should do this , " or " we should do that , " we should show what we can do by a new successful example			2
people say there is no culture of venture business in @entity14 , but actually social games and our company , @entity5 , became successful within seven years			1
so we want to have an impact on @entity14 by showing that it can be done			2
what drives you ? @entity5 originally started as my personal business using my money and my spare time			1
so of course it is good if i can make money out of it			0
however , my motivation is that i want to have an impact on society with my business			0
do you think your industry will become the most important part of @entity14 's economy ? it is true that the social gaming industry is an important industry for the @entity14 economy			0
originally there were many @entity14 game companies like @entity79 which became successful globally			0
@entity14 is an island and an industry like ours does n't have to worry about importing raw materials or exporting			0
in that sense we can do our business without having the disadvantage of being on an island , so i think it is a good industry for @entity14			0
what is the problem with older , traditional manufacturing businesses ? if they have a problem , i think it would be that they tried to compete only in the domestic market and did n't try the global market			0
that means they can only be successful in @entity14 and they need to think more globally			0
what @entity14 should do now ? of course it is easy to blame politicians but @entity14 is democratic and its citizens choose the politicians			0
so the problem does not only exist in them			0
i think the biggest problem is that so many people have not been able to accept the fact that we can not survive without trying to compete globally			0
do you think mobile game industry can be a savior of @entity14 ? i do n't know whether we can be a savior or not but i can say there are not many industries which can generate this much profit and become successful globally			1
not just our company but the whole of @entity14 should consider developing an industry like that .			1
