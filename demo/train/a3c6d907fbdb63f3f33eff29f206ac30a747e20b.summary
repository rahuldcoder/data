" " their life 's work is our security and the freedom that we too often take for granted			0
every evening that the sun sets on a tranquil town ; every dawn that a flag is unfurled ; every moment that an @entity35 enjoys life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- that is their legacy , " the president said			0
after his remarks , @entity6 and first lady @entity42 laid a presidential coin before each of the 13 battlefield crosses -- the helmet , boots and rifle representing each of those killed -- before family members and comrades filed past			1

" no faith justifies these murderous and craven acts , " @entity6 said at the memorial service			1
but he said soldiers who responded to the attack " remind us of who we are as @entity35			2
" " we are a nation of laws whose commitment to justice is so enduring that we would treat a gunman and give him due process , just as surely as we will see that he pays for his crimes , " he said			0
no charges have been filed , and authorities have not identified a motive in thursday 's attack			0
but in a statement issued monday night , the @entity113 said its investigation " indicates that the alleged gunman acted alone and was not part of a broader terrorist plot			0
