-- can you serve coq au vin made with red wine in @entity4 anymore ? nobody 's completely sure			1
confusion reigns in the upscale restaurant kitchens of the @entity9 sheikdom after a circular was sent out by @entity4 officials earlier this week stating that the use of alcohol in cooking was " strictly prohibited " since it violated the @entity17 country 's strict alcohol rules			1
arabian business , quoting the head of food inspection for @entity4 , reported that hotels had one month to stop using alcohol in food preparation or face fines ranging from $ 545 to $ 5,445 ( aed 2,000 to aed 20,000 ) , even rising to as much as $ 136,000 ( aed 500,000 ) for serious repeat offenders			1
but just as the frost was starting to develop on the foie gras ( which can come marinated in wine ) , @entity4 authorities did an apparent u-turn , with a senior official saying there had been a " misunderstanding " of the rules -- and that there was no ban			1
chefs and hotels have now been told that the @entity4 municipality will call a meeting soon to clarify the alcohol guidelines , @entity37 , president of the @entity38 and director of kitchens at the @entity40 , told @entity0			1
@entity37 told @entity0 he thought stricter rules will be brought in , but that there will be no ban			1
" i expect the change will be that all the dishes prepared with alcohol will have to be on a separate menu , " the @entity49 executive chef said , so that it 's easier for @entity51 to identify which dishes contain alcohol			2
he said he also expected stricter guidelines on storage of food prepared with alcohol and perhaps utensils used to eat food prepared with alcohol			1
at the moment , dishes that contain alcohol can be sold in the city 's restaurants if they are clearly marked on the menu			2
the drink must be stored and the food prepared separately			0
alcohol is available to drink at licensed restaurants and bars , which are usually found in international hotels , although @entity51 are not legally allowed to drink			2
@entity37 , who oversees 14 restaurants , said the @entity4 authorities were generally supportive of the emirate 's hospitality industry and were not " here to make life difficult for us			1
" but he said he thought more complaints were coming into them from local @entity51			2
he added that not all @entity4 restaurants were complying with the current regulations			1
@entity4 , not that long ago a sleepy pearling village , has unique demographics			1
a massive 85 percent of the people there come from another country , vastly dwarfing the conservative local @entity90 population			1
and that unusual population divide can cause culture clashes , like the present confusion surrounding a possible alcohol cooking ban or the recent case of the @entity97 couple appealing a one - month jail sentence for kissing and drinking in public			1
read about how a kiss highlighted @entity4 's culture clash " for them [ @entity51 ] , alcohol is a 100 percent no - no , even if it 's boiled , " @entity37 said			1
" and that has to be respected			0
we are living in a @entity17 country			0
" @entity37 said he thinks the ban confusion happened because authorities have received " more complaints " from locals			2
@entity110 quoted the director of the emirate 's food control department as saying the reason for the clampdown under the existing 2003 law was that a number of complaints had come from locals			0
@entity4 's foreign population has swelled in recent years as expatriates flocked to the booming emirate , attracted by a high standard of living , jobs , no taxes , and year - round sunshine			1
the population changes have meant that local @entity90 are vastly outnumbered , raising concerns among them that the lightning - speed modernization threatens their deeply conservative social and religious identity			0
the two populations could n't be more different			0
the tiny local @entity90 population dress in floor - length robes , shun alcohol , pray five times a day , and are rooted in conservative @entity17			2
many of the country 's @entity138 expatriates and tourists , however , are drawn to the desert sheikdom - by - the - sea 's relaxed beach lifestyle			0
expatriates who live in @entity4 said authorities are more sensitive to these types of culture clashes than in the past			2
" more people are misbehaving , " said @entity37 , who 's been working in @entity4 for 17 years , arriving when the sheikdom was just a " small village			2
" " there are more than 200 different nationalities living here , " he said			0
" if you do not respect each other 's rules and cultures , there will be clashes			0
" " in the past , you would not have seen people in very casual summer clothes here , " he said			0
we are guests in this country			0
we must behave as guests			0
" @entity168 , a culture consultant with @entity170 - based @entity169 , a consultancy group that advises both foreign and @entity90 clients on how to bridge the cultural divide , told @entity0 some expatriates need to learn more respect for their host country			0
" it 's very silly to believe that if you 're coming from country x , y and z , you 're going to create a copy of that country when you come to the @entity90 , " she said			0
" why do n't you just stay home if you need everything from home ? "			0

stricter alcohol cooking rules may be brought in
back - and - forth on ban may be result of *increased* complaints
@entity4 demographics *strikingly* unique with 85 percent foreigners
