-- federal investigators have found salmonella bacteria in chicken feed and in barn and walkway areas at @entity8 farms at the center of the nationwide outbreak , officials said			1
the feed or feed ingredients could have become contaminated after they went through heat treatment that was sufficient to kill salmonella , officials from the @entity12 told reporters			1
produced at a mill at a @entity21 facility , the feed was given to pullet chickens at both @entity21 and @entity23 , which between them recalled more than a half - billion eggs since the salmonella outbreak			1
the @entity27 @entity26 said a total of 2,403 cases of @entity30 had been reported in the @entity27 between may 1 and august 25			2
normally , 933 cases would be reported in that time period			2
the dramatic difference of 1,470 cases may be linked , at least in part , to the outbreak and the tainted eggs , a @entity26 spokeswoman said			2
officials indicated in a conference call that this is the largest salmonella enteriditis outbreak since tracking began in the mid- 1970s			1
testing at @entity21 farms in @entity8 showed the presence of salmonella in the food mill and in manure at two locations , said @entity48 of the @entity12			1
she said investigators are still drawing samples at @entity23			1
'' feed were the sources [ of the salmonella ] , but perhaps not the only sources , " @entity48 said			0
the feed could have been contaminated in a number of ways , including by birds , rodents and people 's shoes or boots , officials said			1
@entity21 , in a statement issued later thursday , said it will " work with @entity12 as they expand their review of feed ingredients purchased from outside vendors for our farm , as well as for their ongoing review of our farms			1
" " @entity12 while on our farm tested meat and bone meal that is provided by a third - party supplier as an ingredient for our feed			0
the ingredient is held separately in an overhead bin that was tested by @entity12 officials prior to being mixed in with our feed			1
" this finding obviously is of great concern to us			0
as part of our internal investigation and in response to @entity12 's initial consideration of feed as a possible source , on august 23 we pulled and sent samples of all ingredients used in our feed for further se [ salmonella enteriditis ] testing			1
in addition , today we provided @entity12 with information about our third - party supplier and immediately notified that supplier of the testing results			0
... " we have received from @entity12 three positive environmental se tests			0
it 's important to understand that a positive environmental test does not mean eggs from that barn would have @entity108			0
" @entity21 spokeswoman @entity109 said the third - party supplier and manufacturer is @entity113			1
a call to the company was not immediately returned thursday night			0
thursday 's update by federal regulators came amid rising questions of how the companies monitored their facilities and the speed of the government response			1
rep. @entity123 , @entity124 , announced a @entity126 subcommittee will hold hearings september 14 on the safety of the nation 's food supply			1
the subcommittee has requested inspection reports and notices of any violations , among other documents , from @entity21 and @entity23			1
" we are working right now to respond to the @entity138 , and we will approach it in the same forthright manner as we have in our cooperation with @entity12 to date , " said @entity135 , confirming that owner @entity136 has been invited to appear			0
@entity23 founder @entity142 also has been asked to attend , said spokeswoman @entity144 , who likewise said the company is cooperating with officials			1
dr. @entity147 , the associate commissioner for food safety at the @entity12 , said it took weeks to trace the clusters of salmonella reports to contaminated eggs			1
officials did n't believe a massive early recall made sense , nor did they want to wait for confirmed laboratory results , he said			2
" we have to strike a balance between being timely and accurate , " @entity147 said of the @entity12 's move august 11 to ask the companies to do a voluntary recall			0
@entity8 does not have an egg quality assurance program , @entity48 said			2
" we are not sure how and when this feed could have been contaminated , " she said			0
@entity12 officials said new producer egg safety rules , which took effect in july after the outbreak began , will greatly reduce the possibility of a similar salmonella outbreak in the future			1
more people are likely to report becoming sick because of the two to three weeks it takes for salmonella to manifest itself , said dr. @entity174 , acting director of the @entity175 at the @entity26			0
no deaths have been linked to the outbreak , regulators said			0
@entity174 said elderly people living in nursing homes have not fallen sick , as they might have in past outbreaks			0
increased egg safety procedures in restaurants , along with pasteurization and thorough cooking , have put a dent into the outbreak , he added			2
egg consumers had two new brand names to search for in their refrigerators			2
@entity21 , which was responsible for 380 million of the 550 million recalled eggs , said 60 - egg cases sold under the @entity194 brand in @entity195 and @entity196 were being recalled			1
eggs included in the recall are labeled with plant number 1026 and date codes ranging from 136 to 228			0
dates and codes can be found printed on the label			0
the plant number begins with the letter p and then the number			0
the @entity207 follows the plant number , for example : p - 1026 228			0
in addition , @entity210 released a statement saying it was doing a voluntary recall of @entity215 - supplied shell eggs			2
the @entity210 - branded eggs were distributed to grocery stores and food - service companies in @entity195 in 12 - egg cartons , 20 - egg over-wrapped packages , and 60 - egg over-wrapped packages with date codes ranging from 136 to 229 and plant numbers 1026 , 1413 , 1720 , 1942 and 1946			1
according to a spokeswoman for the @entity225 , the two newest " subrecalls " do n't add to the total number of eggs recalled ; both the @entity194 and @entity210 eggs were counted already as part of @entity21 's 380 million			1
new regulations went into effect july 9 requiring egg producers with more than 3,000 hens to take measures designed to prevent the spread of salmonella			2
while @entity12 inspectors typically did n't inspect farms until after an outbreak of illness , @entity147 , the associate commissioner for food safety at the @entity12 , said that under the new rule , " we will be beginning routine inspections of egg farms throughout the @entity27			1
" while the recall involves hundreds of millions of eggs , they represent less than 1 percent of the 80 billion eggs produced in the @entity27 each year , said @entity250 , director of the food safety program at the @entity225			2
but even that risk level is too high for some restaurant patrons in @entity254 , the most recently added state on the list of those receiving tainted eggs			0
" it makes you not even want to order or buy the eggs , " @entity258 , a customer at a @entity259 in @entity260 , @entity124 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity261			0
@entity259 uses eggs unaffected by the recall			0
" it makes you uneasy about buying eggs , even if they are supposed to be safe			0
" @entity0 's @entity269 and senior medical producer @entity270 contributed to this report .			0
