-- in november 2010 , i watched " @entity7 's @entity6 " and saw a piece on the hazing antics at several historically black colleges and fraternities			1
i took to @entity8 to share my thoughts on the issue			1
much of the report focused on @entity12 , and man , did the floodgates open as a number of students from the university angrily tweeted me back , cussing , yelling and screaming , with some defending hazing , while others were angry at the national attention focused on their university			1
for hours we went round and round , and were joined in the discussion by members of several black fraternities , including my own @entity28 a number of these individuals actually supported hazing , or " pledging hard " and not becoming a " paper " member who " skated " into the fraternity			1
despite the anger and vitriol , i refused to back down , making it clear that getting beaten for being in a band or fraternity was absolutely dumb			1
one year later , when news of the death of @entity42 drum major @entity43 became public , i immediately thought of that discussion and those folks who viewed hazing as a ritual worthy of continuing			1
here was a young man who went off to college , planning to earn a college degree while leading one of the nation 's most colorful and exciting bands , only to be returned home to his parents in @entity55 in a coffin			1
while hazing immediately was suspected , we could only speculate about the cause of the 26 - year - old 's death			1
that is , until friday , when the medical examiner released details of his autopsy , concluding that @entity67 " collapsed and died within an hour of a hazing incident during which he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows to his body			1
" news of the death has rocked the @entity42 campus , angering its students and alumni , triggering multiple state investigations and leading gov. @entity74 to call for the suspension of school president @entity76			1
that prompted @entity42 students to march to the governor 's mansion on friday and camp out on his lawn , demanding he rescind the resignation call			1
champion 's death is n't the first time we have seen individuals in a band or fraternity die			1
it is incredible that some folks have given their lives -- literally -- for just being a part of a student group			1
state laws have been passed , organizations have been kicked off campuses and national fraternal and sorority groups have paid millions in settlements because of hazing , but we continue to see these stories			1
" why ? " is a consistent question that is asked , and at the end of the day , it boils down to power and a desire to demand others kowtow to someone else 's demands in order for them to be accepted			1
a decision not to follow through means you can be ostracized , ignored and marginalized			1
that 's the last thing any young person wants to experience when in an organization			2
every one of these organizations is overseen by adult leaders or advisers			2
but in truth , fellow students run the show			2
normally in a band , a drum major sits at the top of the food chain , but @entity67 clearly had to bend to the band 's culture to be fully accepted as a member of @entity42 's " @entity131			1
" so what you have is a bunch of students between the ages of 18 and 22 calling the shots and making it clear who is accepted and who is n't , who gets in and who does n't			2
you aim to please them and no one else			2
oftentimes they are leading based on how they were led , and it has been indoctrinated into them that this is the way of life , take it or leave it			2
these are powerful forces that can only be changed by peers			2
hazing will only be brought to a close when members of organizations make it clear the vile hazing traditions will not go forward			1
no one today can be hazed if the student leaders make it clear that it 's unacceptable			2
yet because of the natural turnover in student organizations , that mindset has to be created and passed on for it to succeed			2
when i was about to pledge @entity28 in spring 1989 , i met with my four other pledge brothers and made it clear : i 'm not getting hit , i will never use alcohol and i will not agree to be hazed			2
even though my older brother pledged the same fraternity at @entity173 two years earlier without any nonsense , i was making it clear that such shenanigans were idiotic			2
all five of us agreed and in the four weeks , two days , 16 hours , 38 minutes and 39 seconds i was on line ( yea , having to recite such specifics was a part of our process ) , the behavior that we often heard was associated with pledging did n't exist			0
yet because of that , we were n't always as accepted by other fraternity members at other campuses			0
our chapter was called soft ; we were criticized as not " pledging the right way " and had to constantly defend our manhood			0
me , i did n't give a damn			0
i would look others in the eye and say , " in the history of our chapter , only one brother has failed to graduate , and we do nothing with him			0
are you guys on the six - or seven - year plan , and can you match our graduate rate ? " from my perspective , we were supposed to be in college to graduate , not to pledge			0
and if my fraternity was founded as a study group at @entity207 on december 4 , 1906 , why would we eschew academics ? even though we pledged the right way at @entity173 , that peer pressure was still unbearable for some			0
that summer at our national convention in @entity213 , hazing was on the agenda , and i made it clear i was going to speak			1
some other brothers in my chapter pulled my coattails and said , " do n't tell the brothers you did n't take any wood ( that 's being paddled )			0
" i yelled , " if we pledged brothers the right way , why in the hell are we afraid to say it ? " since those days , i 've never wavered from my anti-hazing position			0
it is deplorable and shameful to think that someone would beat another person for them to prove something			0
prove what ? they can take a punch ? no. i prefer to challenge his mind , his intellect			0
our goal as fraternity men is to take young men and mold and shape them to be better men			0
it is not our aim to take young men and train them to be collegiate mercenaries , hellbent on inflicting as much pain as they got onto the first person they have control over			0
is there tremendous value in fraternities , sororities , bands and student organizations ? absolutely			0
the leadership opportunities are tremendous , and the lifelong relationships are vital			0
but what has to be preached and preached and preached to every student , whether they are white , black , @entity260 , @entity261 , male or female , is that if they love that frat , sorority , drill team or band , they should n't do anything to jeopardize it for the next person			1
do we need tougher hazing laws ? yes			1
do we need universities to take punitive action , including kicking students out who break the rules ? yes			0
do we need national organizations to ban chapters for years for egregious behavior ? absolutely			0
should fellow student leaders turn in others who break the rules and haze ? of course			0
there must be a zero tolerance attitude from every state official , administrator , student leader and organization member			1
to hell with tradition , rituals and " the way we do things			0
" all that must end			0
but we also must raise a generation of young people who have enough confidence in themselves to say , " i will not take a beating just to be accepted by you			0
i 'd rather not have your affection or support if it means putting my life on the line			0
" and if that means other students calling you out or teasing you , fine			0
i 'd rather you talk about me like a dog today than be hazed and have my friends search to figure out what to say at my funeral			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity317 .			1

@entity317 says he has long been opposed to hazing
the death of a university band member has raised the topic again , he notes
a zero tolerance *policy* on hazing is needed now , @entity317 says
