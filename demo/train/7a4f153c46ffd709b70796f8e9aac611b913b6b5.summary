-- lawmakers drew battle lines for a fresh round of sparring over @entity6 sgt. @entity5 after a classified briefing monday on the prisoner swap that led to his release			1
authorities released an update about his condition			0
and more details emerged about his time in captivity			0
details about why he disappeared off a military base nearly five years ago and ended up in @entity23 hands remain murky			0
one thing is clear : the political debate over @entity5 's release is showing no signs of dying down			1
here 's a cheat sheet on the latest developments , based on @entity0 's reporting : after classified briefing , lawmakers have ' more concerns ' monday it was the @entity36 ' turn to hear the @entity39 administration 's explanation of how it handled @entity5 's case , as top @entity42 deputies tried to convince lawmakers they made the right call when they did n't notify @entity44 in advance about the controversial exchange of @entity5 for five @entity23 figures			1
but it did n't seem like many minds were changed after the classified briefing , @entity0 's @entity48 reported			2
" if anything , i have more concerns , " said rep. @entity50 , @entity52 - @entity51			2
" probably the most distressing thing or the most disturbing thing i heard was at least 80 to 90 people in the administration were aware of this proposed deal , and yet they could n't notify anyone in @entity44			1
" after monday 's briefing , @entity62 spokeswoman @entity61 said that figure was the number of people in the administration authorized to get intelligence information about the @entity23 in @entity69			1
" the specifics of the detainee exchange and the related military operation were more closely held , " she said			1
why was n't @entity44 told about the deal beforehand ? lawmakers at monday 's briefing said they were told concerns over possible leaks made the @entity42 keep them in the dark over the deal			1
rep. @entity78 , @entity79 , told @entity0 's " @entity80 : @entity81 " that the @entity42 should have told congressional leaders , even if the law gave them wiggle room			1
" i think the president had the constitutional authority ... to make this decision without consulting with @entity44 , but i think it would have been wiser , far wiser , for the administration to have notified certainly the leadership of @entity44 in the interest of having good relations , " he said			0
" most of the leaks that have taken place have come from the administration and not from @entity44 , " he added , " so they really should have brought at least the leadership within their confidence , and i think that was a mistake			0
" and that 's not all			0
some lawmakers are also steamed about the terms of the deal			2
they say they 're worried that the five @entity23 figures released could end up back on the battlefield -- a concern administration officials have downplayed in their public comments defending the deal			1
do n't expect the sparring to stop any time soon			0
a briefing of the @entity112 is scheduled for tuesday			0
and the real fireworks are expected to come wednesday , when defense secretary @entity114 is scheduled to testify before the @entity115 , where he 'll likely face questions about the administration 's decision not to seek congressional input on the deal that secured @entity5 's release			1
@entity5 has n't spoken to his parents yet @entity5 is " continuing to improve every day " as he recovers at a military hospital in @entity126 , @entity124 spokesman col. @entity123 said monday but he has n't spoken with his family yet			0

doctors at @entity135 , where @entity5 was taken after his handover , have said he 's in stable condition but not ready yet to travel to the @entity138			1

@entity0 reported friday that @entity5 has said he was kept in a small box after trying to escape , according to a senior @entity138 official , who spoke on the condition of not being identified			1
the official also told @entity0 that @entity5 suffers from psychological trauma caused by physical abuse			2
a @entity23 source with knowledge of @entity5 's captivity told @entity0 's @entity170 on sunday that @entity5 escaped at one point and was on the run for three days			1
when he was recaptured after that attempt , according to the @entity23 source , he was not punished with a cage or cell , but was taken to a more secure location where he had no chance to escape			0
a @entity138 official told @entity0 last week that @entity5 may have tried to escape his @entity23 captors on at least two occasions			2
he wants to be recognized by his old rank the @entity155 report added that @entity5 has taken walks outside his hospital room while wearing his @entity6 uniform , according to the @entity138 official			2
@entity5 , who was promoted twice on schedule while in captivity , objects to being called sergeant , the @entity155 reported			0
@entity5 said he wants to be recognized by his old rank , a senior @entity138 official told @entity0 @entity124 correspondent @entity191 on sunday			2
@entity5 was a private first class when he went missing on june 30 , 2009 , in @entity195 's @entity194 province , where he was deployed with the @entity196 , @entity197 , 4th @entity198 , @entity199			2
" in his mind , he 's a pfc , " the official told @entity191			0
his parents have received threats the @entity204 is investigating threats against @entity5 's parents , who have not been seen publicly since sending their son messages of love through a news conference days after his release			1
" we are working jointly with our state and local partners and taking each threat seriously , " @entity204 special agent @entity211 told @entity0 in an e-mail saturday			0
@entity211 declined to detail the nature and severity of the threats , and a military representative for the @entity221 declined to comment			0
@entity5 's father received threats in three messages via e-mail at his home , according to a law enforcement official familiar with the contents of the e-mail			1
the first threat came on wednesday , the official said , adding that @entity204 investigators will be tracing the messages to pinpoint who sent them			0
since @entity5 's release , critics , including a former member of his unit , have contended that @entity5 deserted			1
the @entity6 concluded in a 2009 report that he left his post deliberately			0
but the @entity6 has no definitive finding that @entity5 deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something @entity6 officials ca n't learn without talking to the soldier , a @entity138 military official told @entity0			2
@entity0 's @entity247 , @entity191 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 and @entity246 contributed to this report .			0
