-- if you 're thinking of setting up an amazing man cave or showing off a ginormous baby bump next year , think again			1
a northern @entity5 school on friday released its 37th annual list of words and phrases that it believes should be " banished " from the @entity9 language , and it suggests that some classic -- and perhaps hackneyed -- should get the ax			1
@entity11 once again solicited people online to nominate terms they consider tired , overused or simply annoying			1
based on those submissions , the arbiters at the school decided to put the following on this year 's chopping block : " amazing , " " baby bump , " " shared sacrifice , " " occupy , " " blowback , " " man cave , " " ginormous " and " the new normal			1
" " pet parent , " " win the future , " " trickeration " and " thank you in advance " also have been unofficially sentenced to linguistic exile for the crimes of excessive and inappropriate usage , according to the university in @entity24 on the @entity26 border			1
" worn - out words and phrases are the new normal this year , but with some shared sacrifice , we can clean up the language and win the future , " a school representative said in a written statement			1
" with the addition of this year 's nominations , the list of words and phrases banished over the years has become ginormous			1
" " @entity48 " -- arguably one of the most overused adjectives in the @entity9 language -- topped this year 's list of submissions , according to the university			2
" banish it for blatant overuse and incorrect use ... to stop my head from exploding , " begged @entity52 from @entity53 , according to the press release			2
" @entity62 used it three times recently in the opening 45 seconds of his program , " said @entity59 , a resident of @entity60 , @entity5 , referring to the @entity0 anchor			0
" my teeth grate , my hackles rise , and even my dog is getting annoyed at this senseless overuse			0
" i do n't even like ' @entity72 ' anymore , " she complained			0
@entity73 from @entity74 , @entity75 , insisted that not all men are enamored with the concept of the traditional man cave			1
" it is not just overused , it is offensive to we males who do not wish to hunker ( another awful word , often misused ) down in a room filled with stuffed animal heads , an unnecessarily large flat - screen tv and @entity88 memorabilia , " he said			0
" not every man wants a recliner the size of a 1941 packard that has a cooler in each arm and a holster for the remote			2
so please , assign ' man cave ' to the lexicographic scrap heap where it so rightly belongs			1
" @entity99 from @entity100 , @entity101 , had some free advice for politicians hitting the campaign trail in 2012 : dump " win the future " or you may not win the race			2
" on its very face , it 's an empty , meaningless phrase , " he explained			0
" it basically says that anyone who opposes anything meant to ' win the future ' must want to ' lose the future , ' which is highly unlikely			2
" " @entity119 " seemed particularly irritating this time around , with contributors complaining that its usage shows a lack of proper education			0
" this combination of gigantic and enormous makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck every time i hear it , " said @entity120 of @entity121 , @entity122			0
" each utterance reminds me of the high school drop - out that first used this offensive word in my presence			0
" " this word is just a made - up combination of two words , " adds an @entity135 , @entity136 , resident named @entity137 , who refused to offer his last name			2
" either word is sufficient , but the combination just sounds ridiculous			0
" as for " baby bump " -- a term used to describe a pregnant woman 's rounded belly -- this " is a phrase we finally need to give birth to , then send on its way , " declared @entity144 from @entity121 , @entity145			1
" i 'm tired of a pregnancy being reduced to a celebrity accessory			0
or worse , when less - than - six - pack abs are suspected of being one , " said @entity157 , a respondent from @entity159 , @entity160			0
@entity11 's annual " word banishment " list was first created at a @entity165 in 1975			1
the school now claims to receive tens of thousands of nominations every year .			0
