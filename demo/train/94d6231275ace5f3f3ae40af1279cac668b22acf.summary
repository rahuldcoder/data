-- smart policies are essential to @entity4 's " war on obesity			0
" the latest idea in that fight is a curious proposal from mayor @entity8 of @entity9			1
he 's planning to ban the sale of sugary drinks 16 ounces or larger in public venues such as restaurants and movie theaters			1
critics are crying that the move is an infringement on personal freedom			0
but the bigger question is : what 's the rationale behind targeting a single dietary factor in the sea of unhealthy foods and drinks that barrage us every day ? is it scientifically sound ? a typical 16 - ounce soft drink contains about 180 calories , nearly all from sugar			1
it does n't contain any fat			0
while @entity8 's ban will make it illegal to sell large - sized sugary drinks , it 's perfectly legal to sell plenty of other beverages ( milkshakes , anyone ? ) and foods ( how about some ice cream ? ) that pack far more calories per amount served as well as very high levels of fat , sodium or other laboratory - engineered chemicals			1
opinion : @entity52 's visionary move against obesity and what about the typical meal that goes along with a soft drink ? a fast food meal contains tons of calories and is loaded with ingredients that are known to increase risks for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases			0
and , it is consumed in a matter of minutes			0
if @entity52 's ban goes into effect , fast food restaurants can easily game his policy by offering a regularly portioned sugary drink that will likely come with free refills			1
many academic scientists in the field of obesity prevention support @entity52 's efforts			0
after all , the track record looks good			0
@entity9 hit a home run when it banned the use of hydrogenated vegetable oils in restaurants			2
granted , scientific evidence have consistently showed that these cooking oils are hazardous to health			0
experts have claimed that sugary drinks are a leading cause of obesity			1
if you make it more difficult for people to consume excessive amounts of these drinks , then should n't we see a drop in obesity ? overheard on @entity0 : doughnut lovers ' lament , washed down with a giant soda it seems so simple on the surface , but it 's not			2
obesity is the result of an extremely complex interplay of factors , including dietary habits , environment , genes , etc. one of the best studies available , appearing last year in @entity110 , tells a more complicated picture			2
the study shows that if you increase drinking sugary beverages by one serving per day , it will lead you to gain an additional pound of body weight over four years			1
a similar amount of weight would be gained from eating an additional serving of red or processed meat daily for four years			2
but when it comes to potato chips , there seems to be a stronger relationship with weight gain ( 1.65 pounds )			1
and @entity128 fries blew away the numbers ( 3.65 pounds )			1
does this look like good scientific evidence for banning the sale of large portions of soft drinks ? not really			2
especially since the floodgates are open for selling enormous sizes of @entity128 fries and bacon double cheeseburgers , which seem to have more effect on weight gain			1
we can argue about whether a change in body weight of a quarter of a pound per year is meaningful and how much faith we can put in these studies of self - reported diet			2
but there have been no authoritative research showing whether consuming sugary drinks is directly linked to a rise in obesity			1
so , there is really no way to draw any conclusions about the scientific basis for @entity52 's ban			0
it 's guesswork for all we know			0
controversy fizzing over @entity52 's soda ban the proposal does represent a baby step into uncharted waters that should be navigated			0
a policy aimed at changing people 's level of portion size could n't hurt in our national struggle to reduce obesity			0
if people are going to the drive - through to pick up a fast meal and the large drink they 're getting is no longer as large , then they would be consuming a little bit less sugar than they would otherwise			0
however , the high profile targeting of a single dietary factor , based on shaky obesity science , may be setting us up for disappointment if there is no measurable public health impact			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2

mayor @entity8 of @entity9 plans to ban sale of large sugary drinks
@entity192 : a ban based on shaky science may be setting us up for disappointment
why target a single dietary factor among so many unhealthy foods and drinks , he asks
@entity186 : eating @entity128 fries seems to have more effect on weight gain
