-- if that last beer made you feel a little warm and fuzzy inside , it could be because you just did some good			1
you may have just donated to a charity , just by buying a drink			1
i first noticed this philanthropy trend while enjoying a new limited release @entity8 from @entity10 called @entity11			0
the name implies having more , and the compelling flavoring of juniper berries and chocolate malts had already sold me on that proposition			1
but then i read the beer 's label and learned that it was crafted to benefit a charity called @entity20 , which helps people in the food industry going through hard times			1
this initiative was inspired by @entity26 chef @entity25 , who brought the @entity26 restaurant community together when he fought and ultimately lost his battle with cancer			1
his wife and friends decided to take the generous funds that were raised to help @entity25 and pay it forward by creating this charity			0
i admit that it got me when i read that the juniper berries were added for @entity25 , because he so enjoyed cooking with them			0
@entity38 , @entity10 's director of marketing , says that 100 % of the profits from this beer will be donated to @entity20			1
" we saw it as an opportunity to help the folks in the hospitality industry that helped build our brand through word of mouth			0
" @entity10 has sold every drop , and it is already hard to find a bar that still has any left to serve			1
trust me , i 've looked			0
@entity52 already knew their customers ' thirst for a cause - worthy beer			1
each summer they launch a @entity58 campaign with the release of @entity60			0
bar patrons annually show their support for this by purchasing paper fish that decorate the walls and ceilings of bars throughout the @entity68			1
beer lovers looking for a charitable ale available year round , can head to @entity71 and ask for a @entity72			1
the brewery boasts an @entity74 and a @entity75 which both come with a prepared toast on the label : " here 's to doing good			1
" 100 % of the profits of the @entity72 beer company goes directly into their nonprofit , the @entity81			1
this initiative purchases food from area farmers , which is distributed to food bank partners in @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			2
@entity93 ' ceo @entity92 sums it up this way : " at @entity96 's we turn beer into food			1
" @entity92 says their community 's response has gone beyond just drinking beer			1
" a lot of people follow us for our social mission			0
we have 1500 volunteers that come not for beer , but to help pack food at the food banks			2
" not to discount the bar patrons ' efforts , @entity92 quickly adds that the key to their success is still and has always been the creating of a tasty beer that gives people an opportunity to make a difference			1
just as brewers have tapped into the cause - oriented audience , bars are also finding ways to reach out to them , and to make their own impact			1
customers at the @entity126 in @entity127 , drinkers do n't have to choose a specific beer to be charitable ; they just select a cause			2
each month the bar - which is run as a joint operation by numerous @entity127 restaurateurs and bar owners - selects four local nonprofits			2
the one that receives the most votes will receive 100 % of the saloon 's profits from the next month			2
it 's like an election , but with alcohol			2
@entity126 's @entity143 explains , " when you buy a beer or some food , you are given a ticket			1
you then drop the ticket into one of the four voting boxes , whichever charity you choose			0
" this unique concept has made the @entity153 very popular			0
the competing nonprofits encourage their communities to visit the bar so they will get votes , and the winning nonprofit encourages everybody to visit the following month , because they will be getting all the profits donated to them			0
@entity143 adds that this also creates an alternative way to help			0
" it makes giving more fun , more interactive			2
if you are just writing a check you do n't feel engaged , but when you are standing at our voting booth , you feel like you are making an impact			0
" if you do n't want a vote to decide where your donation goes , then travel to @entity172 and choose one from a special menu at @entity175			0
after ordering food or drink at this bar , patrons then pick one of the six nonprofits detailed on their @entity182			2
100 % of the profit from each sale goes to the selected organization			0
@entity186 , the director for @entity175 , says this excites some of his customers who realize in that moment that they just made a difference			0
" they feel empowered , and then they start recommending their choice to other customers , and even share the nonprofit 's vision that they just read about a moment before			2
that 's not your typical bar banter , and i think it is a huge win			0
" while no one is advocating for bar fights over whose charity is better , it is exciting to see the drinking crowd engaged in philanthropy			0
these opportunities to give beer buffs an opportunity to do good is already proving to be a benefit for the industry , nonprofits and the communities they serve			1
and as more bars and breweries join this trend , the idea of giving back can be introduced and embraced with each round , as it was with me and that glass of @entity11			1
however this disclaimer is warranted : all of these organizations offer ways to help , donate and make a difference that does not require alcohol , and donating through drinking does not excuse alcohol abuse or irresponsibility			0
if you wo n't take my word for it , take heed from this satirical warning from @entity235			0
and for more ways to make a difference , alcohol free , visit @entity0 's @entity239			0

breweries and bars are giving patrons an easy way to give back , just by buying beer
@entity52 's ' second helping ' has sold out all around @entity26
proceeds from the beer go to benefit *non-profit* ' the @entity20 '
