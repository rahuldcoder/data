@entity0 -- if president @entity3 had been forthright last week at the health care summit , he would have opened the meeting by stating : " if you have health coverage , under our reform bills you are going to pay more and get less			1
if you are one of the 45 million elderly or disabled people on @entity11 , you are going to get less			0
there is no such thing as free medical care			1
somebody has to pay ! and in the end it is you			0
" those are the facts ! and as senate majority leader @entity21 stated to the @entity22 : " ... you 're entitled to your opinion , but not your own facts			1
" however , the facts , as the president has found out , are not exactly a compelling message to persuade a reluctant @entity25 and public to overhaul nearly one - fifth of the nation 's economy			1
adding 31 million people ( 45 million now do n't have coverage ) to the health care system will cost the taxpayers trillions over time			1
many of that uninsured group ca n't afford health insurance , and if this legislation passes , the government will create an entitlement program to subsidize them			1
in the end , like the entitlement programs that have gone before them , they will far exceed any cost estimates on the table today			1
just to remind you , mr. president and members of @entity25 , the taxpayers have a right to know the full fiscal consequences of this legislation			1
the @entity51 is spending this year nearly $ 2.5 trillion on health care			1
that is 17.3 percent of the @entity51 economy and it 's rising at a rapid rate			1
we spent $ 134 billion more in the past year than in the year before			0
to put $ 2.5 trillion into perspective , that is more money than the federal government received in taxes and revenues this year			0
the problem is nobody knows ( and especially the @entity25 ) what a trillion dollars really means			0
a trillion is a million million			0
still means nothing to most of us			0
if you spent a million dollars a day since the birth of @entity73 , it would n't even equal a trillion			2
if you stacked up a trillion dollars in dollar bills , it would reach 68,000 miles into the sky , about a third of the way from the @entity80 to the moon			0
those numbers are too big for any of us			0
somebody has to pay for the most expensive health care in the world			1
many experts would argue it is also the very best health coverage in the world			2
health care today is paid for by three entities			1
the government ( federal , state and local ) pays more than 50 percent of the costs			1
that is us , the taxpayers			2
the insurance companies pay about one - third of the costs			2
we pay the premiums and the insurance company pools the risk , and distributes our monies back for the medical services			0
they obviously add an overhead cost as does any business , but it 's still our money being paid out			1
the third payer is again us			0
out - of - pocket reimbursements or additional fees come directly out of our pocket and paycheck			0
health care has changed as dramatically as anything in our society in the last half century			1
first , we are living longer			0
in 2007 , @entity51 men could expect to live 3.5 years longer and women 1.6 years longer than in 1990			0
we are long past the days when you walked into a doctor 's office and the doctor -- armed only with a stethoscope , blood pressure monitor and a thermometer -- listened to our symptoms and made a diagnosis			2
maybe in a rare case an x-ray was called for			0
we paid our bill and went to the drugstore and got our prescription			2
there were no @entity135 's , no heart diagnostic tests , no ct scans or any of the wonder drugs that have extended our lives and in many cases made the quality better			2
it 's not that people are n't seeing doctors			1
in the last several years , more than 1.2 billion annual visits to a physician 's office have taken place , averaging more than three a year per person			2
certainly , some efforts must be made to provide some insurance reform -- but that also means malpractice insurance reform			0
some massive efforts need to be made to curb @entity11 and insurance fraud			0
and efforts must be made to create more competition among insurance companies across state lines			0
the president 's attempt to add some of the better suggestions from the @entity22 addressing these issues is not going to add any support from that side of the aisle			1
they are minor changes that are positive but do n't tackle the fundamental cost issues or address the new entitlements and mandates that @entity22 object to most			1
reducing costs in most cases means reducing services			2
who does n't want an mri for their child injured in a car wreck ? who does n't want tests done on a spouse or parent who has chest or abdominal pain ? but if @entity21 and @entity188 shove this legislation through @entity25 against public opinion , they and their party will pay a price			2
yet the price @entity192 will pay at the polls in november wo n't be nearly as big a price as our kids and grandkids will pay when the bill comes through years hence			1
if you 're going to have reform , make the system better			0
take your time and do it right			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

@entity206 says president @entity3 should have *explained* that health bill will cost taxpayers *dearly*
he says health care consumes 17 percent of the nation 's economy
he says costs are rising at a rapid rate , and *consumers* are *footing* the bill
@entity3 's attempt to add some @entity22 ideas does n't go nearly far enough , @entity206 says
