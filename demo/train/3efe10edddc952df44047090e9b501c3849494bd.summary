-- as the globe has become increasingly outfitted with wi - fi hotspots and cell phone towers , the skies have long been the last refuge from constant connectivity			0
that 's changing , however , as more airlines are realizing @entity10 's earning potential			1
by its own estimate , one of the fastest - growing companies in @entity13 is @entity16 , which was the first to successfully hook up planes with internet			1
it has since installed systems on several @entity13 carriers , including @entity23 , @entity13 and @entity24			1
according to its ceo , @entity26 , @entity16 's profits grew from $ 37 million in 2009 to $ 112 million in the first six months of 2012			1
" we 're now on over 1,600 commercial aviation jets , which is nearly half the @entity13 fleet			1
we 've done that in four years , which is extraordinarily fast , " says @entity26			0
" in just a few more years , it will be done in @entity13			2
" watch video : in - flight @entity10 takes off though airlines pay to install the equipment , they also reap the rewards ; @entity16 charges the customers for internet usage -- between $ 5 and $ 20 , depending on flight duration -- and shares its revenue with the carriers			1
" more travelers are aware of our service , and many of them want it , " says @entity26			0
" one in five say they will switch a flight to get our service			0
" the drawback with @entity16 's system is that it uses an air - to - ground network of cell phone towers it built across the @entity13 -- each with a 250 - mile radius of coverage -- meaning its wi - fi is n't available when flying over water			1
internet on @entity16 - outfitted planes is therefore limited to domestic flights			1
this is where @entity66 - based firm @entity65 swoops in			1
row 44 also installs wi - fi on airplanes , though unlike @entity16 , it relies on a satellite system , meaning passengers can access internet even when flying over the ocean			1
" this is a distinct advantage , given that two - thirds of the planet is covered in water , " notes @entity73 , @entity65 's ceo			1
also , satellite systems give passengers more options , due to better bandwidth			0
" air - to - ground has certain inherent limitations in terms of the amount of data that can be processed through the network of cell towers on the ground -- for example , live tv really is an impossibility , " says @entity73 , whose company also offers that service as part of its package			0
" in a satellite environment , you 're able to get much more data through the pipe			0
" see also : airplane phone calls to become standard ? but the satellite system is substantially more expensive than using cell - phone towers , and has the added drawback of taking longer to install			2
as airlines lose money for every day a plane is out of commission , this can make the process rather costly			0
some carriers , however , find it 's worth the price			0
@entity114 and @entity115 are among the airlines using @entity65 's service , with @entity118 soon to follow			2
what 's more , @entity119 , which has also joined the fray , has just this month started offering wi - fi to passengers free - of - charge -- the first airline in @entity126 to do so			1
" we had a trial period where we offered it free to passengers , and we saw increases on those routes ; it went up volumes , " notes @entity127 , head of business development for @entity119			2
" after that , we decided to keep it free			0
" at the moment , connectivity is a perk ; airlines that provide wi - fi or mobile services on board stand out			2
this will change , though , as customers increasingly start to expect the amenity , rather than merely appreciate it			0
@entity73 feels that era has already dawned			0
he says : " i was on a plane recently that was n't @entity10 equipped , and this guy sitting across the aisle opened up his laptop and he could n't find the hotspot			2
he slammed it down and said , ' i ca n't believe this , i really needed to get a lot of work done on this flight ! ' " i think we 're already at that point where everyone fully expects connectivity			0
" is it time for all flights to offer wi - fi ? would you pay for in - flight @entity10 , or should it be free ? leave a comment below			1
