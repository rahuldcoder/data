@entity0 has a bag packed , ready to join her partner of two years , a passenger on @entity3 , wherever he is			1
she has included an outfit for him			2
" because he would n't want to wear his dirty old stuff anymore , " she said of @entity6 , a 51 - year - old @entity7 executive			1
" and he probably would n't want to wear a hospital gown , if that 's the case			1
so it 's all ready			1
" she is the first to admit that some of her friends say she is in denial about his fate , but @entity0 is on a desperate search to find the man she calls her soul mate			1
she believes he is still alive and being held hostage somewhere			1
" this is a planned activity			0
somebody wants to do something and make a message out of it , " she said			0
@entity0 , 48 , said her logic tells her that there are hostages and it would serve no good for the captors to kill the passengers			1
the hijackers would look callous and brutal , and they would n't have as much bargaining power , she believes			0
" i have to believe the hostages are valuable to them , " she said			2
if there was a hijacking or other emergency , @entity6 would have been one of the passengers who steadied the ship			1
" he 's very level - headed , " she said			2
" and i think he is the kind of person who would help to calm a really chaotic situation			2
" she said she 's not ready to take the path at the fork in the road that leads to bad news , but she has prepared			2
" because no matter what , i still have to go forward , and no matter what , his family still has to go forward , " she said , standing among moving boxes			0
she and @entity6 were about to move from @entity59 to @entity60 and were going to get married this year			1
they met in 2011 at a bar in @entity59 called @entity63			0
they soon moved in together , along with her teenage son			0
@entity6 and @entity0 have new jobs in @entity60 ( she will work at a school there ) , and the movers showed up the day the plane disappeared			1
she had to send them away			0
the news said the plane was missing			0
then she just did n't believe it			0
the 10 days since have been surreal , she said			0
@entity6 was one of three americans on the plane , which went missing on march 8			1
@entity0 started a @entity79 page and a @entity81 account called " finding @entity84 " to gather and share information about the flight			1
some people are sending comforting thoughts -- " i so believe in my heart they are at out there ! ! praying for all and safe return home ! ! ! ! " writes @entity90			2
others are sharing theories and news reports			0
in one post , @entity0 writes : " @entity79 and @entity81 are resources			1
perhaps there are other useful platforms as well			0
if we keep sharing this , you never know who will see it and be able to answer some questions			0
" she told @entity107 that people ask her what @entity6 is like , and she said if you were in his presence , you 'd see him as a good , generous and thoughtful man who loves his family and friends			1
he made her feel a way that " i did n't believe was possible to feel , " she said			0
and she feels him still			2
" i genuinely feel his presence , " she said			2
" i do n't believe he has left us yet			0

@entity0 says she still feels @entity84 's presence
she writes on @entity79 : you never know who might see a post and offer help
she says she thinks her partner is a hostage and is more valuable alive
@entity6 would *remain* calm , help ease *tensions* , she says
