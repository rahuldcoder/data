-- it was a dark , windy and rainy night when @entity2 returned from work to his home in @entity5 just south of @entity6 , @entity7			1
" it was raining really bad			0
in the wind i heard something screaming with a very dark voice , " @entity2 told @entity0			1
" at first i wondered if it was the crazy neighbors , but then i heard it again and went and checked			0
i saw something really big up in a tree in my neighbors ' yard and it was a moose			1
it must have been drunk after eating fermented apples and as it was reaching out for more fruit it must have slipped and fallen into the tree			1

" we got the alarm at 9.59 p.m. on september 6 that a moose was stuck in a tree , " said @entity29 , spokesman at the @entity30			1
" when we arrived we used the winch to bend down the apple tree so the moose could get himself out of the tree			1
once free , the moose collapsed on the ground and fell asleep			2
so we let him sleep it off and went back home " @entity29 told @entity0			0
" @entity44 are attracted by the apple trees , and in the autumn when the apples have fallen off the trees we normally have at least one of these cases of intoxication			1
these apples , which ferment in their bellies , are n't part of their natural food , so they can get quite angry from this drunkenness , " @entity29 said			0
@entity2 's son , @entity56 , who is about to turn 11 , made sure to take lots of pictures of the ordeal			2
" he is saving up to buy a playstation so he thought he would take pictures that he could sell , " @entity2 said			2

" today the moose came back and walked around the yard , " he added			0
" i think it likes it here			0
