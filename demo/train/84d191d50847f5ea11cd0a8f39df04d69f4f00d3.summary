@entity0 -- " @entity2 " ca n't come soon enough			1
that is the holiday -- date still to be determined -- @entity4 hopes for as his daughter @entity5 fights off virulent flesh - eating bacteria that turned her life upside down in less than two weeks			2
her fight wo n't be over on @entity9			0
she will likely need dialysis for some time to help her kidneys function , and rehab to adjust to life without her left leg , part of her abdomen and perhaps other body parts that surgeons may still remove because of her disease			1
still , on that day , the 24 - year - old @entity21 graduate student should be able to breathe on her own , after medical staff remove a tube now stuck down her throat that is being used to regulate her oxygen level			1
and her parents and her sister should , again , hear her voice			0
" we 're going to celebrate that day forever for the rest of your life , " @entity4 told his daughter as she lay heavily medicated in an @entity31 , @entity32 , hospital bed			1
" it 's the day that my daughter was delivered from this horrible , horrible disease			1
" speaking sunday on @entity1 , @entity4 did n't go into detail about the latest on his daughter 's condition as she fights for her life beyond saying , " we 're holding up very well here			1
" yet , as he 's done in regular @entity45 posts chronicling the ordeal , @entity4 was positive about the future			1
" i have every confidence that @entity5 will be able to overcome this , " he said			0
just last month , she had a full and active life			0
@entity5 was pursuing her master 's degree in psychology , with a focus on eco-psychology -- the idea that harmonizing with nature can be a powerful tool in ensuring one 's psychological health and vitality			1
on may 1 , she and some friends were out near the @entity63 , about 50 miles west of @entity0 , when she grabbed onto a homemade zip line , her family has said			1
that led to a gash in her left calf , and ultimately it took 22 staples to close the wound , according to @entity1 affiliate @entity72			0
athough she did n't know it at the time , it was because of that cut that @entity77 contracted the flesh - devouring bacteria , @entity80			1
dr. @entity81 , an assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at @entity83 , said that @entity80 -- which is " remarkably common in the water and in the environment " -- is one of many bacteria that can cause a flesh - eating process			1
" when it gets into those deeper tissues , it has a remarkable ability to destroy the tissues that surround it in sort of this hunt for nutrition , " @entity81 said			0
" when it does that , those tissues die , and you see the inflammation and the swelling and the destruction that can be very difficult to control			0
" most humans are affected by these bacteria by swallowing them , resulting in diarrhea			0
@entity77 's case was much more uncommon , in that her wound got " infected and the infection ( ran ) wild , " explained @entity81			1
the pain continued for @entity5 after her accident and , on may 4 , a friend took her to an emergency room where she was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis and flown to @entity31 for surgery			0
she went into cardiac arrest after being removed from the operating table , but was resuscitated , @entity1 affiliate @entity114 reported			0
it was then , @entity4 recalled on his @entity45 page , that he was " told that @entity5 might not survive the night			1
" she did survive , though surgeries cost her the leg and part of her abdomen			1
a post saturday on a blog set up by the @entity21 psychology department said more operations are coming : " @entity5 will suffer the loss of her fingers , however physicians have hope of bringing life back to the palms of her hands , which could allow her the muscle control to use helpful prosthetics			2
" at one point her lungs " required 100 % pure oxygen to be fed to her through a respirator , " as the bacteria ravaged her body , her father wrote			2
by sunday , she had improved significantly to 33 % -- just 12 percentage points shy of 21 % , the level of oxygen in air around us			2
if and when it gets to that point , she can be taken off the respirator			0
and her family can mark that moment , @entity9 , on their collective calendar to celebrate this year and every year after			0
for now , @entity4 is busy standing by , conversing with medical staff and expressing appreciation for his " amazingly resilient " daughter , as well as for the medical staff , friends and complete strangers who have shown their support			0
and the entire family is staying hopeful , fueled in part by the remarkable progress they 've seen so far			2
" the words i hear from the medical professionals to describe @entity5 's continued recovery are ' astonishing , ' ' incredible , ' ' confounding , ' ' mind - boggling ' and ' unbelievable , ' " @entity4 wrote saturday on @entity45			2
" all those are fitting words			0
my favorite word is ' miracle			0
' " @entity1 's @entity173 and @entity174 contributed to this report .			2

@entity77 , 24 , was infected with @entity80 on may 1
she 's since lost a leg and part of her abdomen and may lose her fingers
her father says he was told she may not survive , but she has improved
he 's *awaiting* " @entity2 , " when she *'ll* be able to speak and breathe again
