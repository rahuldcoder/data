-- a month ago , @entity1 was hurtling down the @entity3 bobsleigh track at 150 kph on her way to winning an @entity6 silver medal			1
now the 29 - year - old has swapped the ice for a rugby ball as she sets out on her quest to be a @entity11 with the @entity13 sevens team at the @entity14 in 2016			1
it 's an ambitious bid -- @entity16 had never played the game until two weeks ago			1
" i 'm offside all the time , " she says frankly			0
" i 'm running ahead of the ball all the time			0
" the other problem is that with the bobsleigh , i was used to just running in a straight line			0
that seems to be my default setting , and it does n't work like that in rugby sevens			1
it 's a sharp learning curve			1
" @entity16 could have been forgiven for taking more time off after the @entity6			1
with a bronze from @entity31 four years ago , she had gone to @entity3 seeking gold with new partner @entity33 -- a track star who tasted success at @entity35 in the 4 x 100 meters relay and won 400m silver in 2004			1
in the end , they came agonizingly close to victory , edged out by just one - tenth of a second after four runs on the @entity6 course by @entity44 duo @entity43 and @entity45			1
it left @entity16 with her demons			1
in the following days , she wrote on her blog : " every night , i 'm haunted by that last run			0
i have n't slept much since it happened			0
i replay the skids so vividly in my head that any thoughts of the other corners are reduced to a mere hazy memory			0
" so how does it feel to feel like you choked in front of the whole world ? how does it feel to have your lifelong dream slip away literally from your fingertips ? it sucks			0
was i too exhausted ? did i just finally hit my mental limits ? i do n't know			0
" the inquest into every painstaking moment of that final run -- the @entity13 duo 's slowest by half a second -- has dissipated in recent weeks , but @entity16 concedes " you still ca n't help going through what happened , what you might have done differently			1
" she has allowed herself to increasingly dwell on the silver lining of @entity3 more often than asking " what if ? " thankfully , there has been barely been a chance to stop and think -- there were welcome - home celebrations in @entity82 before she set out on her sevens mission , and @entity16 also has a wedding to plan			1
prior to traveling to @entity87 , @entity13 @entity86 coach @entity85 invited @entity16 to the @entity13 @entity88 ( @entity89 ) in @entity90 to test herself at rugby			1
" a couple of girls on the bobsleigh team had previously played rugby and made the switch , " she says			1
" so i thought why ca n't i do it the other way around ? " the coach asked me if i was interested in coming to practice and then come out after the @entity6 for a trial			0
i 'd never tried it out before so i thought , ' why not ? ' " even though i have n't played the game before , i think they looked at me and thought i was the right build			0
i 'm a big girl -- i 'm 175 lbs and 5 foot 8 inches -- so i knew i was n't worried about doing the hitting or getting hit			0
" i think i was just worried about not knowing the rules			2
it 's been a case of out of the frying pan and into the fire , but it 's been a blast			2
" the switch of sports is nothing new for her			0
her first sporting foray of note had been in softball and there were hopes of being selected for the @entity13 team for the @entity125			2
she missed out , and the sport was duly scrapped from the @entity6 schedule			2
by then , her focus had already switched to the bobsleigh , an event she first tried out in 2007			0
it has brought her two @entity6 medals and two world titles , as well as a fiance -- fellow @entity13 bobsledder @entity137			0
the pair had been dating for two years when @entity137 took the decision to pop the question at the 2013 world championships in @entity142 , with @entity16 standing on the podium			1
@entity137 had roses in his hand when he was handed the microphone by organizers , and he dropped to one knee			0
at the time , @entity16 admitted : " it was such a shock			1
" as if mastering a new sport was n't enough , @entity16 is now planning a wedding for april 24			1
" it 's been crazy but it 's mostly planned			2
obviously the focus was on @entity3 so we were a little bit late out with the invitations but we 're steadily getting the @entity160 in , " she says			1
" i 'm getting married at my parents ' house			2
it 's already been a great 2014 whatever happens with the rugby , and i 'm pretty excited about the big day			1
" the pressure is on @entity16 to play a remarkable game of catchup with her fellow @entity13 rugby players as she attempts to marry her strengths to the requirements of the code -- a shortened version of the 15 - a - side union format			1
but as an athlete nicknamed " e-money " -- from her ability to deliver when it counts in the pressure situations -- she is confident she will get to grips with it			1
" if it goes well , it would be awesome to be part of the team in @entity14 , " she says			2
" @entity14 was the thing that got me interested and that 's the very obvious goal			1
" but that 's some way off			2
my legs were burning so much from that first week			0
it 's not that i 'm not fit but this is such a different level of fitness , there 's so much cardio			2
" but i 'm optimistic that i 'll get better ... a lot better			0
to get to @entity14 would just be super crazy			0
" in her sporting switch , she has had a useful ally in @entity33			0
" @entity33 talked about how special the @entity200 was , how huge it was , " says @entity16			1
" she talked a lot about the pressure of being on the start line for the 100m final			0
" i 've basically been asking her for as much information as possible			0
she 's given me some good advice			2
" @entity16 has oval - ball history -- her father used to play in the @entity210 for the @entity211 , though his career was coming to an end when she was young			1
" if i 'm honest , the thing i remember the most was the team mascot , @entity216 , " she says laughing			2
" i really remember there was a @entity218 's nearby and i remember eating a cheeseburger in the playground when the @entity216 appeared			2
i 'm not sure my @entity221 appreciates that being my favorite memory of him playing			0
" despite her new sporting flirtation , @entity16 is not divorcing herself from the ice track just yet			1
" as we get closer to @entity14 , i realize i may need to change my approach and focus more solely , on sevens , but i do n't want to give up the bobsleigh at the moment			0
i love it too much			0
