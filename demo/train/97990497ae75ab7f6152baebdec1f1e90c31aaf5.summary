-- when i saw the headlines about @entity3 getting into a shouting match with a @entity6 congressman this week , i assumed the combative and conservative @entity8 host had just gone off on him			1
@entity3 was trying to conduct what we in journalism call an interview			1
but from the first words out of his mouth , rep. @entity14 came prepared to pick a fight			1
it was good television , i suppose , but it 's hard to say it was enlightening			0
@entity14 began insulting @entity3 from the get - go , @entity3 pushed back , and the pugilistics were under way			1
after i criticized @entity14 in an online video , fox - bashers , hannity - haters and others started with the nasty tweets			1
but it was @entity14 , not @entity3 , who had started throwing verbal punches			1
said one tweet : " even psychotic liberal @entity32 thinks @entity14 was out of line with @entity3			1
" ( for the record , i consider myself reasonably sane			0
) go look at the video and decide for yourself			0
i 've never been shy about criticizing @entity3 for mangling the facts or spouting the @entity39 's talking points			2
but in this case , he was n't at fault			0
this was n't a situation where both sides were engaged in an argument that grew more heated			0
watch : why media are savaging @entity48 over @entity50 work policy why would the @entity52 lawmaker launch a premeditated assault ? perhaps it 's good politics for a @entity56 to force a confrontation with @entity3			1
he can brag to his base about beating up on one of @entity8 's most popular pundits			2
in fact , at least one liberal group is already trying to raise money off the incident -- another example of how unbridled partisanship can be profitable			0
@entity14 told me : " i stood up to @entity3 because of what the sequester will mean for millions of @entity70 who have already been forced to work harder while they get by with less			1
if these devastating cuts in the sequester go into effect at the end of this week , three - quarters of a million jobs will be lost			1
... " i have constituents in @entity52 who will lose their jobs because @entity39 in @entity80 are unwilling to close loopholes for yacht owners			0
the president is not being an ' alarmist in chief ' or ' president panic ' when he talks about these cuts ; he is leading			0
" watch : why @entity3 was n't a ' yellow journalist ' in face - off with congressman a person close to @entity14 , who would speak only on condition of anonymity , told me that the congressman allowed @entity3 to get under his skin because he felt the host had taken president @entity97 's words out of context			1
here 's how it got going : @entity3 had played a series of brief clips of @entity97 and began with this highly partisan comment : " if and when the @entity97 sequester takes effect on friday , it 's because the president is more concerned with fear - mongering than finding a solution to the problem that he himself created			2
" no sooner did he tell @entity14 , " welcome back , sir , " than the congressman took , shall we say , vigorous issue with @entity3 's opening			1
" quite frankly , you are the worst excuse for a journalist i 've ever seen , " said @entity14 , who then accused him of " yellow journalism			2
" @entity3 's not a journalist , he 's a commentator paid for his conservative opinions , but let 's not quibble			2
@entity14 was getting revved up again when @entity3 tried to make a factual point			1
" what the president said was dead - on accurate , and for you to say the president is to blame here is ridiculous			0
i was there august 2011 when the @entity39 , your party , which you shamelessly			0
... " watch : did @entity129 e-mail really threaten @entity130 ? @entity3 interrupted : " i 'm not a @entity39 , let me correct the record			2
" " you are nothing but a @entity39 , " @entity14 said			2
@entity3 got out that he is a conservative , not a registered @entity39 , whereupon @entity14 accused him of being " a shill for the @entity39			1
" @entity3 -- who does carry the party 's water most of the time -- allowed @entity14 to go on for a couple of minutes			1
then he tried to ask a question and the congressman repeatedly talked over him			0
that is pretty much how it went for the rest of the segment , with @entity14 at one point calling @entity3 " immoral			1
" @entity14 accepted the invitation to come on and then showed more interest in name - calling than having a dialogue			1
watch : overreaction ? conservatives rip @entity152 's @entity151 moment the shout fest was , perhaps , a microcosm of what 's become of our media and political dialogue			0
there is so much noise in @entity161 that those who want to break through sometimes feel compelled to keep boosting the decibel level			0
debate is reduced to each side yelling at each other rather than engaging on the issues			0
how different was the @entity3 / @entity14 clash than @entity129 speaker @entity169 telling the @entity170 to " get off their ass " and pass a budget ? @entity97 and the @entity39 have kept hurling accusations of bad faith at one another until the automatic budget cuts that both sides once deemed unthinkable loomed			1
the thinking seems to be : if there 's no possibility of compromise , why not just take potshots and try to win the news cycle ? most cable news anchors and political players do n't descend to that level			0
but can anyone deny that the media have contributed to a coarsening of the political culture ? @entity3 , who finds new reasons to attack @entity97 every day , is hardly the poster boy for bipartisanship			2
but in this instance he did invite a politician with liberal views and attempt to be civil			0
maybe they both end up benefiting from standing their ground against a fierce opponent			0
but it 's viewers who lost out			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity32 .			0

@entity32 : @entity3 - @entity14 dust - up made for good tv
he says @entity8 host was just doing interview , and @entity14 picked fight on spending cuts
he says escalation , name - calling a *sad* *reflection* of coarsened political *discourse*
@entity32 : each man may have stood his ground on *principle* , but viewers lost out
