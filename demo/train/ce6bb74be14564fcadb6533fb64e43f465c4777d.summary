-- even as @entity4 titles like " @entity5 " and " @entity6 " continue to attract millions of players , interest in social games may be waning			1
a rise of tongue - in - cheek parody games that poke fun at these popular outings points to rising discontent amongst both gaming fans and industry insiders			2
" there 's a general feeling of discomfort and bafflement with all of the @entity22 and @entity23 notifications you see on @entity4 and other social networks , " said @entity16 founder @entity15			1
" it 's become almost absurdist			0
" witness @entity15 's new social gaming spoof , " @entity28 , " a @entity4 game in which you click on cows to earn the right to click on more cows			1
it 's a form of biting interactive satire			0
" any cultural force that we do n't grasp but that seems to overtake us becomes ripe for parody , " @entity15 added			0
" i created ' @entity28 ' in part to give myself and others a second look at ' @entity44 ' and its ilk and force social - network games players to ask themselves what these [ titles ] are and why they 're so compelling			1
" from social - gaming protest groups to fake " @entity44 " commercials , there are plenty of signs that other social networkers share similar sentiments			1
this year has also brought " @entity60 , " a game in which players repeatedly click to complete random missions such as " ambush silk traders " or " slay dealers			0
" creator @entity62 's blog said he analyzed popular @entity4 games and distilled their gameplay into core game mechanics " to point out the pointlessness of many casual games			1
" some gaming experts claim that social - network games put business concerns before artistic ones and are specifically designed to prompt base pavlovian responses and keep players clicking away			1
according to @entity74 games researcher and theorist @entity75 , social games are " brain hacks that exploit human psychology in order to make money			1
" " there are forces that compel us humans to do incredibly counterintuitive things , " concurred @entity15			0
" ' @entity28 ' is a game in which you click a cow , and yet that simple act can still swallow us whole			0
we like to think of ourselves as rational beings with control over our faculties , but far more often , we are at the whim of things rather than master over them			0
" some professional game makers even accuse social network titles of promoting addictiveness and using shame as a motivator			2
for example , " @entity5 " players who fail to accept requests from friends or upkeep their virtual homesteads may be subject to public mockery			0
social networks like @entity4 offer gamers the ability to interact easily with millions of other users and rally support for positive causes , @entity15 says			2
but he believes that their potential is being underutilized by @entity118 tech entrepreneurs			0
" it 's not the idea of social games that are the problem			1
[ it 's that ] nobody 's talking about what would make them good art but only what would make them immensely profitable , " he said			0
naturally , social game makers beg to differ			0
@entity133 , chief designer for " @entity44 " creator @entity134 , whose games also include such @entity4 hits as " @entity136 , " believes that social games " tend to be vastly underrated by many of gaming 's opinion leaders			1
" " this is partially i think because they 're so simple , " he suggested , " and partially because people just are n't used to the business model or games being able to speak to such a large mass market audience			2
" @entity133 , the former head of @entity148 and a strategy game designer whose credited work includes contributions to the " civilization " franchise , thinks social network titles are a major positive for the field			2
" working in social games feels more like the games industry did when i started 20 years ago , " he says			1
" small , scrappy teams working on games that emphasize fun and playability , and not so much huge technology , @entity164 engines and full - motion video			1
for designers , it 's a really fertile space to be creative			0
" despite a steep drop off in popularity since @entity4 shut off social games ' ability to spam user profiles with messages and updates this year , @entity133 argues that the market for social gaming has n't peaked			1
he cautions that some user attrition is inevitable and that an ongoing evolution in social gaming is needed to stave off player boredom , and he believes that the fundamental multiplayer context of these games will ensure their survival			2
" that 's the real nuclear bomb for me , " he said			0
" unlike previous games , you 're playing light games with real friends that you have actual ' real - world ' social connections with , not meeting strangers online			2
" @entity15 believes traditional game developers are " stuck in a strange no - man 's - land " between the entertainment industry and the high - tech industry			0
" at the same time , traditional developers are understandably startled and even jealous of the massive and sudden success of social games , " he said			1
" so there 's a good deal of self - loathing at work			0
