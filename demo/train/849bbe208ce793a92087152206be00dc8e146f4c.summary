-- certain people exude such a powerful presence that they can absolutely captivate you within the very first moment of meeting them			1
when i was introduced to @entity8 at a conference , he was that kind of mesmerizing			2
a fortysomething , @entity13 - trained doctor casually dressed in jeans and @entity16 , he took the stage and spoke passionately -- with an actor 's eloquence -- about aging			1
he laid out a vast and ambitious plan for how @entity22 could transform the experience of growing older , of what it means to be well , and of how we care for people in their seventies , eighties , and nineties			2
he argued that the medical system , the elder - care system , and the nursing home system have to evolve : " aging should be conceived of as an era of continual growth and renewal , rather than a period of decline , " he said			2
he had absolute clarity in every part of his argument , and his energy was both motivating and mobilizing			2
when i talked to him after his session , i asked , " @entity44 , how do you describe your purpose in life ? " he answered , spontaneously and effortlessly , " to bring respect back to elderhood in @entity22			1
" in eight words , he captured his entire life 's work			2
@entity44 reminded me that the first step in living your purpose is to distill it			1
this very act sets an accurate compass heading			0
it shapes your choices , tells you what is important , and helps you separate the merely interesting from the truly crucial			1
how to find your company 's purpose so how might you go about finding your purpose in a way that 's as compelling as @entity44 's ? how do you find a due north course for yourself , or your tribe , or your entire company -- a course that you may sometimes veer from , but that always draws you back to center ? over the years , i 've worked with leaders from @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , and numerous other companies on making this journey			1
as we begin to imagine -- or reimagine -- the company 's purpose , the process typically begins with looking at the intersection of several key truths : - what does the world hunger for ? what does it desire ? what does it need or suffer from a lack of ? - what are the unique talents of the organization ? - who has the company timelessly been ? - and who must it fearlessly become ? a company 's purpose lies at the center of these four forces			1
to discover it , we incite debate , storytelling , self - examination , study sessions in the historical archives , musings about the future			0
we help leaders in these companies find what they truly care about			1
that work of introspection and getting to clarity is rarely easy			0
but it is almost always rewarding			0
once defined , purpose informs a company 's every move			1
it adds meaning and mindfulness to day - to - day operations and motivation that goes far beyond			0
how to find your personal purpose what 's interesting is that this method , which works so well for finding a compass heading for a company , also works for individuals			1
to define your personal purpose , start with these questions : - how will the world be better off , thanks to you having been on this earth ? - what are your unique gifts and superpowers ? - who have you been when you 've been at your best ? - who must you fearlessly become ? at the intersection of these four questions lies your personal purpose			1
the questions are deceptively simple , and you might be tempted to rush through them			1
to really do the task justice -- and to do yourself justice -- you have to peel away the layers of your self - conception			1
you have to get beyond that image you 've made for yourself that you so strongly defend			0
and you have to get at what is actually true			0
the tension among your answers reveals as much as the commonalities			0
this process may take days			0
it may obsess your thinking for weeks			0
for some , it takes years to unfold			0
there is no magical timeline			0
move at your own pace			0
the same process holds true whether you 're a leader doing the hard work of articulating a purpose for your organization or you 're an individual ready to live a more directed life			1
so let me return to my story about @entity8			0
at the end of our conversation , he said to me , " what would you say your purpose is , @entity172 ? " i thought about it a bit , then started to talk : " i work with companies as they go through deep , formative periods of transformation			1
i work with @entity178 to help mobilize people during those times of change			0
along the way , i help them see things from new vantage points , and then help those institutions rise to the challenge ... " i kept talking , but @entity44 politely interrupted			0
" @entity172 , way too much ! it does n't sound like you 're very clear about what your personal purpose is			1
his reaction made me reflect			0
i consider myself a fairly self - aware and mindful person ( do n't we all ? ) , and i thought i was pretty clear about why i 've been put on this earth			0
but @entity44 pointed out something powerful			0
the work of introspection is put into action only once you 've succinctly put your purpose into words			1
after leaving the conference , i spent a few weeks crafting what i believe my purpose is			1
" to help people aspire , then be , great			0
" and then , coincidentally -- or perhaps there are no true coincidences -- @entity211 asked me to write this essay			1
putting purpose into action once you 've vocalized your unique purpose , how exactly does it play out ? how do you put it into action ? i like the way @entity221 , one of the world 's foremost experts on purpose , describes how to approach the next step			2
he defines purpose as being in the right place with the people who matter to you , doing your life 's work			2
so the endeavor becomes , in @entity221 's words , to " pack " and " repack " one 's life -- discarding ideas , thoughts , duties , old baggage about relationships , in favor of packing the things you truly need to be at your best in life			2
i am constantly humbled at how purpose drives the people and companies i admire : @entity250 served as the ceo of outdoor clothing pioneer @entity252 for a decade			2
in his post , he was responsible not only for the financial health of the company but also for charting its positive impact in the world			0
his personal purpose is about helping people live a mindful existence -- that is , to bring thoughtfulness and intentionality to their work and play			1
meanwhile , @entity252 's purpose is to " build the best product , cause no unnecessary harm , and use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis			2
" with both his personal and business purposes aligned , @entity250 created a company culture that continues to make @entity252 the proof of concept for a different kind of compassionate business			0
ask : how can your personal purpose align with your organization 's purpose to create the conditions to do good in the world ? @entity284 -- the sui generis thinker behind the cradle - to - cradle design approach -- demonstrates a commitment to his personal purpose of creating a sustainable planet in how feverishly he lives it out			1
he 's in @entity293 one day helping to build sustainable cities , and speaking to young architects about how to rethink energy efficiency on the next			0
one day he 's with the ceo of @entity298 discussing different kinds of transportation , and the next he 's researching the chemical composition of building materials to create ones that are healthy for the planet			0
ask : can you live your purpose in a more all - encompassing way ? artist , architect , and activist @entity309 's purpose shows up not only in what she makes but also in what she chooses not to make			1
she spends her time focused solely on the projects and causes that allow her to grow and contribute			0
she says " no " to the rest			0
restraint and discipline come to those who are clear about their purpose in life			2
ask : what does your purpose reveal about what you should stop doing ? in the start - up realm of @entity330 , companies live or die by how quickly they move and act			1
but for @entity333 -- one of @entity72 's most impactful early employees and today the founder of mobile social network path -- smart is more important than fast			1
in order to help his company live up to its purpose of creating technologies that bring us closer to the people we love , he has started a " slow product movement " -- a mindful practice that is not about speed of product development but the quality of the things he develops			1
ask : what does your purpose imply you must be patient about ? purpose drives impact , impact rewards purpose purpose compels you to act			2
it brings into focus the things that matter most			1
i asked @entity8 how he 's made so many strides in advancing his cause over the years			0
his response : " i entertain the conversations , meetings , relationships that are most in line with my purpose over any other activity			2
frankly , life is simply too short to fritter away your time chasing things that do n't matter to you			0
" and here is the most interesting bit : the impact you have in the world also affirms your purpose			1
it empowers you to live your purpose more boldly every day			1
this is how everyday people can achieve extraordinary things			0
we listen to that purpose			2
we achieve things because of our purpose			2
and that in turn makes each of us hungry to live by our purpose even more			1
in our own humble way , this is how people become great			0
will you take the next step ? will you invest the time to find your personal purpose ? will you gather your colleagues to define the purpose of your organization ? in that move , greatness emerges			1
