-- a federal judge ruled thursday that the @entity2 is liable for a coal ash spill in eastern @entity4 in which a massive mixture of toxic ash and water blanketed approximately 300 acres			1
" ... had @entity2 followed its own mandatory policies , procedures , and practices , the subsurface issues underlying the failure of @entity10 would have been investigated , addressed , and potentially remedied before the catastrophic failure of december 22 , 2008 , " @entity15 district judge @entity14 wrote in his 130 - page decision			1
plaintiffs have three weeks to file briefs recommending how the court should proceed in the next phase -- in which they must show they are entitled to relief			1
from the archives : months after ash spill , @entity4 town still choking in a statement , @entity2 said its " commitment has not wavered -- to clean up the spill , protect the public health and safety , restore the area , and , where justified , fairly compensate people who were directly impacted			1
" it added , " @entity2 remains committed to the full restoration of the community directly impacted by the spill , while being mindful of our responsibility to manage ratepayer dollars			1
" @entity2 said it has bought more than 180 properties , settled more than 200 other claims from area residents and gave $ 43 million to the @entity43			1
it predicted the recovery project will continue through 2015			0
the spill began before dawn when the walls of a dam holding back more than 1 billion gallons of coal ash waste stored in a retention pond at @entity2 's @entity51 , 35 miles west of @entity52 , trembled and crumbled			1
the mixture of water and ash , enough to fill nearly 800 @entity57 - sized swimming pools , fouled the adjacent @entity58			0
there were no deaths , but three homes were destroyed and about a dozen others damaged			0
the spill contained toxic materials such as arsenic , selenium , lead , chromium and barium			2
but the @entity2 and the federal @entity70 have reported that air and drinking water in the area were safe and that the levels of toxic substances did not exceed federal standards			1
thursday 's decision was followed closely by nearby residents			0
" i 'm absolutely thrilled , " said @entity79 , who lives on the banks of the @entity58 , about a mile from where the spill occurred			2
" it 's just a huge accomplishment for our community and for other communities much like ours that are sitting in coal ash zones			0
" the ruling not only sets a precedent , she said , " it also allows people to hope that what happened to us will never happen to them			0
" @entity79 , 56 , said property values have sunk for the 40 - acre farm that has been in her family for generations			0
" would you spend your money to live here ? " she asked			0
" the possibility of long - term health effects remains a concern from the disaster , she said			2
" it 's infiltrated so much of our lives you start to become numb to it : the water 's not good , do n't swim in the river , do n't eat the fish , if you fall overboard , hurry up and get back on your kayak			0
" in 2010 , @entity116 state officials slapped the @entity2 with $ 11.5 million in fines after the state 's @entity118 determined that the authority had violated state clean - water and solid waste disposal laws			2
the @entity2 itself agreed to pay $ 40 million for economic development projects in @entity51 in 2009 as part of a larger fund set up for cleanup efforts .			2
