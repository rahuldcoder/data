@entity0 -- as speaker of the @entity4 , @entity2 faced battles on two fronts during his first term : fights with president @entity9 on a series of high - profile fiscal issues , and internal skirmishes with conservative rank - and - file republicans who openly defied him because they did n't think he was doing enough to cut spending			1
and as @entity9 takes the oath of office and begins to address the challenges of his second term , his on - again , off - again negotiating counterpart faces his own set of challenges in the coming weeks			1
days after the bruising fight at the end of 2012 to avert the fiscal cliff that divided the @entity4 @entity28 conference -- as well as his own leadership team -- a dozen @entity31 broke with @entity2 by not supporting him for speaker in the public vote on the @entity4 floor			1
@entity2 was reelected with the vast majority of his conference sticking with him , but the episode demonstrated his weakened position and raised questions about whether he could lead his members in new fights ahead			1
@entity4 @entity42 pledge to back @entity2 but after a three - day retreat of all @entity4 @entity42 last week at a resort in @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity28 members appear to be regrouping and putting the messy squabbles behind them			1
leaders are shifting their strategy away from one of aggressive confrontation to giving some ground to show they can govern			0
@entity2 succeeded at tamping down the public splits among @entity31 -- at least for now -- and adjusted the expectations for his members			2
two years ago , a large freshmen class backed by the tea party handed @entity2 the gavel as speaker			2
this group pushed for massive spending cuts and changes to how the government operates			0
but the dysfunction and gridlock after those demands hit a wall with a majority @entity71 @entity70 and @entity9 , sending @entity73 ' approval ratings plummeting			2
polls show the @entity28 got the bulk of the blame			0
for @entity2 , just getting the bare minimum done on @entity78 turned into a herculean task			0
@entity73 faces a trio of major legislative battles in the first 90 days of 2013 -- the need to raise the debt ceiling as early as mid-february , automatic spending cuts kicking in at the beginning of march , and another threat of a government shutdown at the end of march			0
but instead of arguing as they have -- that their majority in the @entity4 is a mandate from voters not to compromise -- @entity28 leaders decided to start the year taking smaller steps to achieve their goals			1
@entity4 @entity42 to vote on three - month debt ceiling extension at the retreat , @entity2 tapped former 2012 @entity28 vice presidential candidate @entity97 of @entity98 , popular among conservative ranks , to walk members through the big fights ahead			1
@entity28 faces realities of divided government @entity97 , the @entity104 chairman , said the @entity28 was still determined to force @entity73 to take up major deficit - reduction measures , but summed up his message to reporters after a session with all @entity4 republicans			1
" we also have to recognize the realities of divided government that we have , " he said			0
acknowledging that another contentious face - off with the @entity4 over the debt limit was n't likely to end well for them , @entity2 worked with a small group of members that included @entity97 and other leading conservatives to come up with a plan to postpone that fight			1
as the retreat ended friday , @entity4 @entity28 leaders announced the @entity4 would vote next week on a bill to extend the nation 's borrowing authority for another three months			1
but their plan removed a hardline demand for spending cuts that @entity4 @entity42 previously insisted had to be attached to any measure to increase the debt ceiling			1
that so called " @entity2 rule " -- any increase in the debt limit had to be accompanied by spending cuts of the same size -- was only going to run into another public clash with the @entity4			1
instead , their legislation conditions the increase in the debt limit on a requirement that the @entity70 pass a budget -- something conservatives complain the upper chamber has failed to do the past four years			0
and their proposal also includes a provision that says if @entity73 does n't pass a budget by the mid-april deadline , its members wo n't get paid			0
@entity4 @entity28 aides maintain that the @entity2 rule is still in place as they negotiate measures down the line , but taking it out of the mix for now was a major acknowledgment that the fight had become unwinnable			1
@entity157 rep. @entity156 , one of the dozen @entity31 who did n't vote to reelect @entity2 speaker , told reporters after the retreat that he agreed it was better to push off the most contentious battle			2
" why would n't we deal with the smaller ones first , maybe build up a little momentum , build up a little credibility -- not only with the credit markets but also with the folks back home -- that we can actually deal with these things , " @entity156 said , adding , " i think it makes perfect sense			0
it 's a rational , reasonable thing to do			0
" another conservative member , rep. @entity175 of @entity176 , who noted that he 's never voted for a debt - ceiling increase , said he supported the approach			0
he also pointed out that the move reflected a commitment by @entity2 to avoid one - on - one - negotiations with the president on these issues in the future , and instead chart a course internally first			2
@entity2 puts onus on @entity9 " i do n't see the divisions now that maybe we 've seen in the past [ among @entity42 ] and i think the process has improved , " @entity175 said			1
different tone coming out of @entity28 retreat the tone coming out of the retreat signals that leaders convinced many of those pushing for broader changes that they need to rethink how realistic it is to send proposals out of the @entity4 only to hit a wall in the @entity70			1
but the cease - fire between conservatives and @entity2 may not last long			2
@entity156 noted that most of the newly elected @entity31 backed his effort to force @entity73 to offset the disaster aid package for victims of @entity207 -- a departure from congressional precedent to give immediate emergency money to states without any strings			0
although that proposal failed , @entity156 argued the strong support for it was evidence that conservatives would have more power internally to pressure leaders			0
@entity218 : ' shame on @entity73 ' for not voting on @entity207 aid " maybe the freshmen might be a little more fiscally conservative than people expect them to be , " @entity156 said			0
rep. @entity222 of @entity176 , who heads the @entity223 , a group of fiscal conservatives , was part of the group @entity2 tapped , along with @entity97 , to devise the three - month debt - ceiling extension			2
while he helped @entity28 leaders generate buy - in from conservatives for moving away from their insistence for spending cuts now , @entity222 summed up his role going forward : " i need to pull our leadership to the right			2
" it 's unclear how the debt - ceiling battle will play out			0
some democrats saw the move to as encouraging , but argue revisiting the issue in three months causes instability for financial markets			0
and @entity4 @entity237 called the requirement for @entity73 to pass a budget a " gimmick			0
" fiscal debates will again dominate @entity73 ' agenda for early 2013 , but other contentious battles such as immigration reform will also split @entity4 republicans and could test @entity2 's hold on the speaker 's gavel			1
after the shootings at an elementary school in @entity255 in december that killed 20 children and six adults , @entity9 has urged @entity73 to make legislation with new restrictions on guns and ammunition a top priority			2
@entity2 told @entity4 @entity42 at the retreat he 'll look at what the administration is proposing , but he does n't plan for the @entity4 to take any action until the @entity70 passes something , and that could be an uphill battle			1
the @entity28 retreat also featured a panel with pollsters who showed internal numbers highlighting the party 's deficit of support among women and minorities			1
both @entity47 gov. @entity279 and former @entity281 gov. @entity280 urged members to step up efforts to show it welcomes those groups			0
attracting minority voters a key @entity28 goal rep. @entity288 , who runs the @entity28 campaign operation to retain and expand their majority , told reporters he tapped rep. @entity292 , the youngest female @entity4 member and a @entity293 , to help with outreach			1
but @entity288 admitted @entity42 need to step up that effort as the @entity293 community was increasing its voting numbers			0
" we recognize that @entity42 have good answers , we just have bad communications in many cases			0

house speaker 's failed negotiations with @entity9 weakened him among his own caucus
@entity4 @entity42 come out of three - day retreat looking like internal squabbles being settled
@entity2 still faces divisive fiscal fights between now and march
other challenges await : gun legislation and attracting women and minorities to @entity28
