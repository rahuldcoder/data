-- the latest release of @entity5 tapes from the @entity6 shows how @entity7 increasingly consumed @entity8 as his second term was getting underway , the library 's director said thursday			1
much of @entity8 's tapes about @entity7 have long been made public , but on thursday , the library released additional @entity5 recordings from february 1973 to march 1973 , plus some from early april 1973 , director @entity10 said			1
the @entity7 political scandal , resulting from a break - in at the @entity17 headquarters , eventually led @entity8 to resign , the only president to ever do so			1
" @entity7 is truly heating up for the administration by the end of this particular release of tapes , in march of 1973 , and you can see it taking more of the president 's time , " said @entity10 , who was a @entity19 and presidential historian before joining the @entity21 , which runs the @entity8 library			1
" the tapes are a magnificent aural history of two very busy and important months in the life of president @entity8 's second term , " @entity10 added			2
on thursday , the library opened a trove of records at the facility and online , and the new information includes 265 hours of @entity5 tapes			2
the library , in @entity41 , @entity42 , also released more than 140,000 pages of presidential records and 75 hours of video oral histories			1
about 2,500 pages of formerly classified national security records have also been made public , and some of them have been posted on the library 's website ( www.nixonlibrary.gov ) , including one about covert actions in @entity53 and another about an understanding with @entity56 prime minister @entity55 on the use of @entity56 bases and @entity60 nuclear weapons			1
" i am agreeable to the amendments as proposed and shall consider the understandings existing between our governments with regard to consultation on the use of nuclear weapons , as so amended , to remain fully in effect , " @entity8 said in a letter to @entity55			2
one memo is written january 17 , 1973 , by current anchor and former @entity8 aide @entity72 , who says she understands that a decision is forthcoming on the " fate " of @entity75 as administrator of veterans affairs ( now @entity76 )			2
@entity75 resigned in 1974 under pressure from @entity78 and veterans ' groups for alleged mismanagement			0
" do you have information which would enable us to provide the @entity85 with a leak ? " @entity72 wrote to @entity87 , assistant chief - of - staff			0
the memo contains handwritten notes stating " approve saying ... " or " disapprove because ...			0
" the newly available materials are pieces to a larger mosaic about the @entity8 presidency , @entity10 said			0
" this release is significant for people interested in how our government thought about the @entity99 cease - fire and its durability , and it 's very significant about the release of @entity60 pows from southeast @entity103 , " @entity10 said			0
" it 's sort of the first release that has materials relevant to the @entity60 government 's handling of the @entity110 incident , " when followers of the @entity112 seized the @entity114 town for 71 days starting in february 1973 , @entity10 said			0
