-- when @entity3 was diagnosed with complex @entity5 syndrome , his life changed			1
having this neurological disorder -- which causes repetitive , involuntary movements and sounds called tics -- led to frequent teasing and eventual bullying			1
it motivated him to lead the charge to stop childhood bullying by addressing students across the country with his @entity3 's @entity17			1
@entity0 : how did this all get started ? @entity3 : in second grade , i was getting bullied a lot for my tics			1
a lot of my friends got bullied , too			2
when my mom made the decision to pull me out of that school , i felt like i was leaving behind all the kids that were being bullied , too			2
i figured if that was just my little second - grade class being bullied , what about the whole world ? so i went to my mom and we made @entity36			2
we talk about @entity5 syndrome , how bullying is n't good , and how you can prevent bullying			1
@entity0 : so how can you prevent bullying ? @entity3 : you always have to tell an adult			1
maybe you need to find new friends			2
a bully might pick on you , but he 's not going to pick on four or five kids , you know ? bullies do n't like " different			2
" i used to get asked a lot of questions , and a lot of the time , i would be too embarrassed to tell them about my @entity5 's , or i just did n't want to , because it 's a long story			1
so they start imitating my tics or just think i was trying to freak them out or be the class clown			2
i remember putting on a fake smile and trying to act like i was laughing at them instead of them laughing at me			2
they would copy me , and it would really hurt			2
that 's how the bullying started			1
actor : i hid @entity5 's from @entity67 but , you know , i really ca n't blame them for being confused or scared , because i was n't even sure of what was going on myself at the time			1
if i did n't have @entity5 's and somebody came up to me and started twitching or making weird noises , i would n't really know what do think about it , either			1
@entity0 : i 've heard all that extra attention can actually make your ticcing worse			0
was that the case for you ? @entity3 : yes ! it helps when i 'm not stressed or when you accept it			1
when you accept my @entity5 's , i do n't tic as much			1
but when you stare or ask lots of questions , i get really stressed and the @entity5 's gets worse and i go all over the place			1
a lot of the time , it really stinks , because i ca n't do anything			0
i like to go to a room and go off by myself			0
but if that 's not an option , i try to be really quiet and concentrate on something that keeps me focused			0
i play a game in my head or think about something			0
i have to distract my mind from things that set it off , like stress or bullying			1
@entity0 : can you hold the tics in sometimes ? that 's one thing that confuses people			0
you can actually control them , but only to a certain extent			0
@entity3 : sometimes i can control it , but a lot of times , it 's just kind of like a rocket ship			1
you know how it fills up with fire and the gas and then finally it 's just like , " @entity120 ! " so if i have to hold them back , it usually comes out a lot more than it would 've if i did n't hold it in			0
it feels good to finally release it and just get it out			0
@entity0 : is there anything you ca n't do ? anything you feel like you 're missing out on , because of your @entity5 's ? @entity3 : i used to not be able to go to the movies , but i 've learned to focus on the movie and they just go away for a while			1
plus , no one is staring at me			0
they 're watching the movie			0
i can ride my bike , skateboard , run			0
' @entity144 ' favorite overcomes @entity5 's , @entity145 's but i have to do a lot of things most kids do n't do , like having meltdowns and taking medications			1
everything else is easy for me , except being quiet			0
i ca n't play hide - and - seek			0
when i try to trick people or fake sleep , i have to turn the other way so people ca n't see my facial expressions , because my face tics when i try to keep my eyes closed			0
i can only win if i 'm at a high point at least 20 feet away , when i 'm not within hearing distance			0
this one time , i gave myself up , because i was on top of my mom 's shelf and somebody was walking past			0
they were about to walk right by and i let out a little squeak and they got me ! i was so frustrated .			0
