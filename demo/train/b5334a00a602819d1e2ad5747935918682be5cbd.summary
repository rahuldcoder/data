a new report suggests adult women are nearly half of all video game players			1
that 's a number that can be read in the changing tone of some of today 's top games			1
but it 's also one that some female gamers say is n't really as close to even as it should be			1
according to the " 2013 @entity11 " report , produced by the @entity13 , 45 % of all game players , and 46 % of the most frequent purchasers of games , are female			1
adult women make up 31 % of the game - playing population			1
" this new data underscores the remarkable upward trajectory for video games			2
it is an entertainment form enjoyed by hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide , " said @entity22 , president and ceo of @entity13 , the trade association that represents the @entity25 video game industry			1
" a diverse and energized consumer base , remarkable new hardware , and outstanding software all combine to foster growth for our industry			0
" female gamers are obviously a diverse group			1
millions enjoy the shooters , strategy games and other titles favored by " hardcore " enthusiasts			2
millions more have eased into the gaming world via social and smartphone games , or through family interactions			2
one of the top reasons why people buy video games is an interesting storyline , according to the report			1
and some women have pointed to a rise in the number of games with complex themes and more scenarios that call for decision - making , not brute force , as a selling point			2
and it does n't hurt that many of those same titles have begun to include female protagonists , or at least the ability to create your own			1
' lady game creators ' meet up on @entity66 " today 's game characters are much more customizable than years ago , " said @entity67 , 26 , from @entity68 , @entity69			1
" this is part of overall game development , but every female gamer i 've met appreciates being able to style her character and make it more unique			1
" @entity77 , a television and web show host whose work has appeared on gaming site @entity81 , the @entity83 and elsewhere , said the industry has been taking notice of the rise of female gamers , and that the inclusion of female characters in meaningful roles is no accident			1
" in a lot of ways , it was the perfect storm for change , " said @entity77 , who is also a writer for the @entity93 game , " @entity94			2
" " the gaming industry 's awareness of having to appeal to a wider audience -- one that included women -- has been reflected with the addition of stronger female characters			1
" the 2013 re-vamped ' @entity106 , ' ' @entity108 's female version of @entity109 and ' @entity110 '' s @entity111 and @entity112 are just a few examples that come to mind			2
" other strong female characters , like @entity116 in " @entity117 " or @entity118 in " @entity118 , " show the range developers are willing to put in their games to attract a wider audience and provide a different experience from games in the past			1
upcoming games like " beyond : two souls " and a new " @entity132 " appear that they 'll continue to put women in the forefront of gaming action and narrative			2
but , sometimes , it 's the little things that can help draw more women into the gaming fold			2
" control schemes need to do more to take into account people who did n't grow up with a controller in their hands , " said @entity137 , a senior editor for the website gamers with @entity139			2
" i 'm not saying make the game easier ; i 'm saying give people who need to learn those basic skills a path to learn that does n't belittle or sideline them			2
" the sustained and growing pop - culture presence of video games also has been a boon for developers looking to add women to their player bases			2
" i think this issue is cultural , " said @entity155 , 28 , from @entity156 , @entity69			0
" since being a geek has become something to be proud of , instead of something to hide , more of my female friends are becoming gamers			1
but they do n't see a lot of games they are interested in , because mostly when you see games advertised it is ' @entity170 ' or ' @entity171			0
' " a majority of gamers play games with their family -- 16 % play with parents , 32 % play with other family members and 16 % play with their spouse or significant other			2
that widening acceptance of gaming is also helping women feel like they belong			0
" i 've noticed the biggest difference in attitude coming from non-gamers , especially other women , who once found my pastime silly , " said @entity186 , from @entity187 , @entity188			0
" now , they seem more accepting			0
it has become the norm			0
" but despite those cultural shifts , talk to many female gamers and you 'll hear stories about a darker side of the hobby -- a persistent " boy 's club " mentality that sometimes manifests itself in ugly ways			1
story after story recounts female gamers who , once they ventured into gaming circles beyond family and friends , faced mockery , dismissive attitudes and even abuse from their peers			1
in one recent story making the rounds in online gaming circles , a girl went into a certain game 's online community , asking about its mechanics			1
the first response she got was from a male player , telling her he 'd answer if she performed a sex act on him			0
harassment of women in online gaming forums is prevalent enough that there 's even a derogatory term -- " white knight " -- for male members who step up to defend them -- the suggestion being that they 're only doing so to gain favor with the woman involved			0
" age of the other gamer makes quite a difference , " said @entity67			0
" older gamers tend to be respectful of female gamers ...			1
anyone 15 or younger does n't get it , but i blame that on maturity			0
" @entity77 says that kind of attitude is beginning to fade , but that it " has n't quite changed just yet			0
" " more and more women can be found in high profile and strong roles within the industry , " she said			0
" yet , just recently , the comment was made to me , ' you 're just a host , right ? you do n't really play games			0
' " @entity262 , of @entity263 with @entity139 , said she thinks the way games are marketed plays a role			0
" there are more women over 18 playing games now than boys under 17 , " she said			0
" but you would n't be able to tell by the contents and comment sections of most game publications , the language / behavior of their fellow players online , or the game design , marketing materials and tactics of most game publishers and developers			1
" @entity155 said trolls will be trolls , especially during competitive , multi-player games			0
however , she does think game companies could do more to crack down on the abuse			0
" i realize these trolls set out to mock any and all gamers and it 's not solely focused on female gamers , " she said			1
" but it certainly feels as if i am being singled out			0
" there 's no reason to think the gaming industry wo n't have more and more of those female gamers to think about in the years to come			1
the @entity13 shows that 35 % of parents are playing computer and video games with their children every week and 58 % are playing with them at least once a month			0
the computer and video game industry as a whole had $ 14.8 billion in sales in 2012 , according to the @entity13 report			1
given that women are 46 % of that purchasing audience , there is a great incentive for game developers to keep women in mind			0
they say they are n't looking for special treatment , are n't asking for female - only games and , in many cases , do n't even like to be differentiated as " girl gamers			1
" instead , they say , they want to be entertained , to be challenged , to have fun -- just like the guys			0
" more women are getting involved , both behind the scenes and as educated consumers , " @entity77 said			0
" @entity328 attitude in gaming needed to stop yesterday			0

report : almost half of video game players in @entity25 are female
gamers cite a rise in strong female characters in top titles
in gaming circles , though , some say " boys ' club " mentality persists
marketing *overwhelmingly* still targets young males
