screams like a woman ? @entity32 took the stand after an acoustics expert , @entity66 , was cross-examined about sounds on the night of killing			1

" the report added that " mr. @entity5 was capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act			0
" had the doctors deemed @entity5 mentally incapacitated during the shooting , the trial would have immediately ended in a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness			2
verdict at the trial 's conclusion , judge @entity118 will have to decide whether @entity5 genuinely made a mistake or killed @entity7 intentionally			1
if she does not believe the athlete thought there was an intruder , she will find him guilty of murder and sentence him to at least 15 years in prison and possibly life			0
@entity1 does not have the death penalty			0
if @entity118 accepts that @entity5 did not know @entity7 was the person he was shooting at , she could find him guilty of culpable homicide , a lesser charge than murder , or acquit him , according to @entity2 legal analyst @entity132			1
