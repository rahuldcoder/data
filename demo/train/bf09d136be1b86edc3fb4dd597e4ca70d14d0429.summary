@entity0 -- president @entity2 complained tuesday that he does n't get out much			2
then he noted he does n't have to when @entity3 and @entity4 come to play a concert at his house			1
the blues and rock legends were at the @entity9 for a @entity11 performance series in the @entity12 honoring the history of blues music			1
a lineup of top blues performers past and present offered a selection of standards that displayed all the raw elements of a distinctly @entity21 musical genre originating from the days of slavery			0
@entity2 even got in the act			2
when goaded by blues giant @entity24 , he sang a verse of the rollicking finale " @entity28			1
" earlier , @entity2 described the genre as a form of oral history that bore witness to the struggles of @entity34			2
" the blues reminds us that we 've been through tougher times before , " @entity2 said			2
" that 's why i 'm proud to have these artists here not just as a fan but also as the president because their music teaches us that when we find ourselves at a crossroads , we do n't shy away from our problems			0
we face up to them			0
we turn them into art. and even as we face the challenges of today we imagine a brighter tomorrow			0
" @entity54 music , @entity2 said , " speaks to something universal , " because " no one goes through life without joy and pain , triumph and sorrow , " and the blues encompasses all of that " sometimes with just one lyric or just one note			1
" " in performance at the @entity9 : @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity54 , " scheduled in february as part of @entity80 , featured longtime blues greats @entity3 and @entity24 playing with contemporary musicians @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 the evening also recognized the @entity73 blues invasion of the 1960s with performances by rock pioneers @entity4 and @entity76			1
renowned rockers @entity82 and @entity83 of the @entity84 also took part , along with @entity86 , a blues guitarist and singer who is married to @entity88 and forms a @entity90 - winning band with him			0
most of the assembled performers took the stage for an opening rendition of " let the @entity95 , " after which the 86 - year - old @entity3 -- playing ringmaster from his seat at center stage -- offered his encouragement for the president 's re-election bid			0
" mr. president , i 've been praying for you for three years , and i want you to keep your job , " @entity3 said to applause			0
@entity107 candidates blast @entity2 the event was emceed for @entity11 by actress and singer @entity110 , who commented on the somewhat surreal juxtaposition of the evening 's lineup and setting			1
" i never dreamt in a million years that i would ever say these next five words , and certainly never thought that i 'd be saying them right here at the @entity9 , but , ladies and gentlemen , @entity4 , " @entity110 said in introducing the original @entity114			1
in appropriate rock star fashion , @entity4 ran onstage to dance and sing " @entity121 " backed by the " house " band led by @entity123			0
before his second number -- a cover of the @entity128 song " @entity129 " performed with fellow @entity130 -- @entity4 talked about his introduction to the blues as a young man in @entity134 with the music of @entity136			1
recounting how @entity136 visited @entity137 and even dressed the part in bowler hat with umbrella in hand , @entity4 added : " he said those @entity134 boys , they want to play the blues real bad , and they do -- real bad			2
" @entity145 and @entity86 then joined @entity4 to provide background vocals on his @entity147 hit " @entity148			0
" in a tribute to the roots of the blues , @entity145 and @entity71 performed a moving version of " @entity152 , " and @entity71 followed with " @entity54 " and @entity153 ' did a solo version of " @entity155			0
" @entity86 , trucks and @entity82 played a tribute to @entity158 with a powerful rendition of her classic " i 'd @entity161 , " and @entity4 returned to join @entity24 , @entity76 and @entity71 for blues standard " @entity163 , " originally written and recorded by @entity164			1
the finale brought the entire ensemble on stage one more time to serenade the president and first lady with the tribute to their hometown , with @entity2 welcoming them as the " @entity174			2
" the roughly 200 guests , including @entity178 members @entity176 , @entity179 and @entity180 , stood and clapped at @entity2 's prompting , then shrieked when the president took the microphone after @entity24 called him out about his recent impersonation of singer @entity184			1
" i heard you singing @entity184 , " @entity24 said , waving for @entity2 to indulge him			1
you got to keep it up			0
" @entity2 did , a bit hesitant at first and then gaining gusto , offering the microphone to @entity3 at one point to help him finish the verse			1
while @entity2 's voice may have lacked the power of the other performers , it was a presidential musical performance unseen since @entity198 on the saxophone .			0

@entity9 tribute ends with @entity2 singing along to " @entity28 "
@entity3 , @entity4 , @entity24 and others perform in the @entity12
@entity2 says blues music " speaks to something universal "
