-- books , movies , magazines and newspapers repeatedly refer to addiction , usually concerning drugs or alcohol			2
it is only recently , in the modern realm of celebrity addictions that the public discourse has added sex to the list of potential afflictions ( see : @entity15 , @entity16 ) and the general public is still rather slow on acceptance			2
how can something as fun as sex be an addiction , you ask ? the answer is , any addiction is potentially destructive , turning something enjoyable , like a pint of beer or an intimate evening into something entirely different			1
feeling compelled can take the joy out of anything			0
" @entity36 , " the excellent and profoundly disturbing sophomore film ( following 2008 's highly - regarded " hunger " ) from @entity40 director @entity39 , is basically a character study of two damaged souls and their relationships both with each other and the world around them			1
it 's a penetrating and deeply unsettling look at addiction , obsession and self - destruction			1
@entity45 ( @entity46 ) is an upwardly - mobile , thirtysomething @entity47 who just happens to spend every waking moment that he 's not otherwise occupied with work , engaged in some sort of sexual activity			1
pornography , escorts , random encounters , group sex , masturbation ... all are fair game			2
he is an addict by any definition of the word and lest you consider sex addiction as a comparatively harmless addiction compared with , say , drugs or alcohol , think again			1
it 's as if he 's constantly in pain and sex is the only way to stop the agony , to shut his emotional life away in a box			1
it 's routine self - numbing , and however charming or chatty @entity45 may be in public , it 's all just a means to an end -- the search for sexual release			1
maintaining a tenuous balancing act between his work life and his life as an addict , @entity45 is thrown off the rails by a visit from his equally but differently damaged younger sister , @entity86 ( @entity86 )			1
the two have a past			0
something has happened in their childhood that has shaped their lives and their relationship and each has dealt with it in a different way			0
while we might be able to read into their behavior somewhat , we are largely left to imagine what that past might contain			0
while @entity45 has buried his emotions in sexual release , @entity86 is the opposite and wears hers on her sleeve , along with scars from a past of cutting and perhaps , suicide attempts			1
she is all externalized emotions , a gadabout to @entity45 's stoic			1
she 's a nightclub performer and extrovert , the exact opposite of her brother 's bottled - up persona , and her visit upsets his apple cart completely			0
in this oil - and - water sibling relationship , all he wants is for her to take life seriously and exhibit some responsibility , while she 's trying to get him to loosen up and have some fun			0
it seems as though neither is capable of doing what the other wants and both are eminently self - destructive			0
he is used to his solo sex life : he has an extensive porn collection , uses escorts frequently and visits internet sex sites , all of which are interrupted by @entity86 's visit			1
she has no idea of his addiction and when she stumbles onto it , things go pear - shaped , but fast			0
@entity46 's performance is not entirely unlike the one he gives in @entity141 's " @entity140 " in that much of his character 's emotional life goes on beneath the surface			1
however , in " @entity36 " it 's reversed			1
while his portrayal of @entity147 in the @entity141 film came alive when he was with @entity149 ( @entity150 ) , @entity45 shuts down when he 's in sexual situations and the only person who can coax an emotion out of him is @entity86 -- and that emotion usually is anger			1
@entity86 , on the other hand , is just looking for some love , caring and protection from her big brother			0
it 's clear the two do n't see each other very often , otherwise she 'd know that @entity45 is the last person to go to for those things and the last to understand what she needs			1
@entity86 more than holds her own against yet another impressive 2011 performance from @entity46 , giving one of the best female performances in a year rife with them			1
a decent shot at a best supporting actress @entity171 nomination , her @entity86 is an open wound , raw and emotionally unguarded and working without a safety net			0
for his part , @entity46 inhabits @entity45 like a less - homicidal version of @entity177 ( " @entity178 " )			1
cool , calm and collected , his emotions buried ... until they are n't and they leap out of him in a torrent			0
like any addict , he 's forever searching for something to soothe his pain			0
the third major character in " @entity36 " is @entity47 , and @entity39 shows its cold , bleak and rather lonely side			2
if you 've lived there for any length of time , you ought to understand : for such a large and vibrant city , it can make you feel like you 're the last person on earth			0
@entity39 uses the subways and dark , outer borough streets , bars and clubs to great effect , leaving most of the city ( and most of its occupants ) outside a tight frame and out of focus			0
no sweeping , glorious views of the skyline , but rather tight shots of @entity45 on the subway or in a club			2
even many of the sex scenes are shot as a collection of limbs and faces and breasts and other various body parts so you often are n't exactly sure where one person ends and another begins			0
as for said sex scenes , they are anything but sexy			0
by the time the most graphic of @entity45 's encounters occurs , arousal does n't even enter the mind			2
much how " leaving @entity225 " was unlikely to cause most people to reach for a vodka on the rocks , " @entity36 " is not going to be the cause for much late - night pillow talk			2
on the other hand , it may just make you reach for that drink			0
" @entity36 " is rated @entity232 - 17 ( no one under 17 admitted )			2
there 's a lot of graphic sex , all sorts of nudity and the subject matter is pretty damn dark .			0

" @entity36 " is a penetrating , deeply unsettling look at addiction and obsession
@entity45 ( @entity46 ) is constantly in pain ; sex is the only relief
he is thrown off the rails by a visit from his equally but differently damaged sister
