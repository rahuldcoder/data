-- where " global knowledge " was once essential for leaders , @entity3 's 2010 global ceo study cited " creativity " as the most important leadership quality for the future			1
this is one of many signals that the business world is evolving out of the " @entity12 , " where left - brain technical skills , knowledge and expertise were king			1
in " a @entity17 : why @entity27 will rule the @entity28 , " @entity18 asserts that current global conditions -- abundance , @entity22 outsourcing , and automation -- are setting the stage for a brand new era : the " @entity26			2
" as employees chart their route to the top in this new era , it 's important to know the skills that companies are looking for			1
in the @entity26 , right - brain skills will be key			1
given the velocity of change and the complexity that results from this , we need to go beyond just knowledge or expertise			1
the best employees of the future will excel at creative problem solving and different ways of thinking -- synthesizing seemingly diverse things together for better solutions , using metaphors to explain new ideas for which no context yet might exist			1

tomorrow 's companies will need to take a creative - thinking approach to the sea of knowledge , bridging the gap between analytical , left - brain functions and creative , right - brain capabilities			1
my new book , " @entity71 , " identifies the most critical skills of the @entity26 -- and simple ways to cultivate them before it 's too late : 1			1
strategic imagination refers to " dreaming with purpose			2
" today 's employee is so mired in busywork that their ability to think long - term has waned			1
but employees of tomorrow must learn to actively imagine future possibilities and create scenarios to act on them			1
seek out resources that fuel future thinking , such as @entity86 , @entity87 , and @entity88			1
challenge yourself to envision your business unit in the year 2020			2
even better , draw your vision -- create a magazine cover , an organizational chart , etc. -- as a visual representation of what the future might look like			1
the ability to ask smart and often unsettling questions is known as @entity99			2
transformative power lies in asking questions that make us rethink the obvious			0
in the healthcare industry , for example , it can be seen in the shift from curing illness to preventing it via wellness services			0
to unearth new answers to existing business problems , learn to ask better questions -- ones that make other team members really stop and think			0
for example , " what are the unshakable beliefs about client / customer needs in our industry ... what if the opposite were true ? " and " which competitors could eat our lunch tomorrow and what are we doing about it ? " by encouraging curiosity , you fan the fires that create new ideas and improve current offerings			0
the quick and obvious strategy will not survive the fierce competition of the @entity26			0
employees will need to continually exercise their @entity136 skills , the application of best practices from unexpected sources to create fresh solutions			1
in the consumer product category , @entity142 exemplifies this skill			0
@entity142 applied the mechanics of a local sawmill -- a giant cyclone - shaped dust collector -- and invented the best - selling vacuum in the @entity150			0
@entity152 this reflex by utilizing an exercise called " re : think			0
" take an everyday object ( paper clip , scissors , etc. ) and pretend you 've never encountered it before			0
what does this new product do ? what are its benefits and who would use it ? activities like @entity167 can strengthen your ability to approach problems in unconventional ways			2

keeping pace with change is a challenge , yet meeting unexpected situations with quick thinking and resourcefulness is the very definition of @entity182			0
in a world where change is the only constant , a @entity183 -- and @entity184 , @entity185 , and @entity186 -- is truly critical			0
cultivate the mindset of preparedness by creating " @entity191 " scenarios			2
using a current project you 're working on , challenge yourself to meet your current goals despite wild cards that might occur -- such as " 50 % less budget " or " half the r&d time " or " severely restrained resources or technology			0
" planning for success under constraint helps you learn agility and prepare for change before it is forced upon you unexpectedly			0
building on agility , employees will also need to demonstrate resilience , which translates to tenacity and courage in the face of obstacles			2
people who are undaunted will give their organizations a competitive edge in the @entity26			0
learn to overcome barriers by practicing the art of " impossible to possible			0
" write answers to these questions : what would a customer say we should do for them but never would ? what would make us the industry leader -- although hell would have to freeze over for it to happen ? what impossible thing would make your job infinitely better ? once you 've made a list , find a way to turn the list of impossible things into possibilities			0
this exercise truly awakens the competitive spirit and gives rise to a solution - driven mindset			0
the business world is at a critical inflection point and to compete in tomorrow 's market , today 's companies must demonstrate more than knowledge or technical expertise : they must cultivate new skill sets			1
the valued leaders and successful employees of the @entity26 will be firing on all cylinders -- and many will involve right - brain functions			1
to avoid extinction , employees must embody the kind of daily future thinking that will enable their teams and organizations to conceptualize -- and handle -- the blessings and burdens of a new era			1
