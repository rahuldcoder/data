an appeals court ruled thursday that " the record suggests no special circumstances or other factors that would justify a reasoned discretionary decision to deny pretrial release			0
" on friday , judge @entity24 -- who wrote in his ruling that the court was " hesitant to announce in open court ... the specific enumeration of reasons to deny bond , " -- adopted the appeals court ruling			2

the former police officer must also " surrender all firearms in his home to either the @entity39 or to his lawyer , @entity40 , " according to the order			0
@entity40 said @entity0 is " a wonderful family man " and " a church - going man " who is " coming home to resume his life and help prepare his defense			1

" " he ripped her family apart and now he can be home , be in his own bed , and see his children and grandchildren , " said @entity53 , @entity54 's attorney			0
" it is unbelievably unfair			0
" heated argument escalated the hearing in february that resulted in @entity0 initially being denied bond served almost as a mini-trial			1
over 12 hours of testimony was heard over two days from witnesses who had also gone to see " @entity67 " that day			0
one patron , @entity68 , testified he overheard @entity0 and @entity10 talking , and at one point , the latter said , " i 'm just texting my 2 - year - old daughter			1
" soon after that , a " very agitated " @entity7 left the theater , then returned a few minutes later			0
at that point , a fairly calm @entity10 asked aloud whether he could check a voice mail from his daughter 's babysitter , according to @entity78 , a retired @entity79 veteran			2
the situation devolved after more words were exchanged			0
@entity82 , an off - duty @entity85 's corporal , said he heard @entity10 say , " i am trying to text my f * * king daughter , if you do n't mind			1
" popcorn flew in @entity0 ' direction soon after			2
" and almost immediately , " recalled @entity78 , who said @entity10 threw the bag , " the gun comes out and there are shots fired			2
" @entity40 said friday that @entity0 " used the law of self - defense to preserve his life just like every citizen has the right to do , " and described @entity10 's conduct in the theater as violent			1
but @entity53 warned friday that with @entity0 back on the street , it could happen again			2
" @entity0 is an absolute danger to society , " said @entity53			0
