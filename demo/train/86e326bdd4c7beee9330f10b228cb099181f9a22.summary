-- there 's no sign hanging on the front door of the @entity5 law school that reads " republicans need not apply			2
" but @entity7 got the message			0
@entity9 , an @entity5 law school alum who had worked for the @entity10 and the @entity11 , worked part - time at the law school 's writing center			0
twice , she applied for full - time positions			0
twice , despite positive reviews and being the most qualified applicant , she was rejected			1
in a federal case heard this week , @entity9 claimed that the state school violated her first amendment rights by rejecting her because she 's a @entity22			1
her claim reads : " @entity24 guarantees individuals the right to associate and express themselves on matters of public concern without fear of reprisal from their government			0
" this guarantee prohibits the government , when acting as employer , from firing , refusing to promote and / or refusing to hire citizens because of their political views or affiliations			0
" the prospect of ideological discrimination in higher education should n't come as a surprise			1
a 2005 study showed that 72 % of college professors identified as liberals			1
only 15 % described themselves as conservative			1
former @entity49 president @entity48 , who served as director of president @entity52 's @entity51 , has compared the paucity of conservative professors to the early days of racial integration in baseball			1
sure , there are conservative professors , just like there were black baseball players in the 1950s			1
" but it appeared ( then ) that there were not any african - american .250 hitters , " @entity48 has said			0
" the only ( black ) players who played were stars			0
" there is a similar lack of conservative professors who are n't " stars			1
" this distortion has left @entity71 wondering whether there is a bias against conservatives in higher education			0
certainly , some of the stats are due to self - selection , with more liberals choosing to go into academia			0
but that was n't the case with @entity9			1
and if she was rejected because of her political views , taxpayers in @entity84 are funding not only an ideological lemming herd but a mob that casts out anyone who questions the groupthink			1
still , is it unconstitutional ? the @entity92 has stated clearly that the @entity93 prohibits a state from basing hiring decisions on political beliefs or associations			2
this rule , though , is not absolute			0
imagine if @entity52 were to be prohibited from rejecting @entity99 for a post in his administration for ideological reasons			1
so the court has recognized limited exceptions for political appointees			2
however , the court has not extended a discrimination exception to academia			2
in fact , the court has said that academic freedom is of special concern to the @entity93			2
and the test set by numerous appellate courts for ferreting out political discrimination is whether someone 's political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind the adverse employment action			0
how would someone like @entity9 meet that test and prove that she was discriminated against because of her ideas on abortion or gay marriage ? the university claims that she lost the jobs because she performed poorly in her interview			0
@entity9 's evidence includes e-mails from the law school 's associate dean , warning her to hide a job offer from @entity132 , which is perceived to be conservative			1
during the faculty meeting to vote on whether @entity9 should be hired , it was mentioned that she holds conservative beliefs			1
and after her rejection , the same associate dean sent an e-mail to the dean , asking whether @entity9 's political beliefs had been considered in the vote			0
@entity9 points out that of 50 faculty members at @entity144 , only one is a registered @entity22 , and 46 are @entity146			1
one of those faculty members , @entity148 , testified this week that he had worked with @entity9 , that she was a " superlative writer " and that the university 's liberal leaning " corrupts everything it touches			1
" meanwhile , the two people hired at the school 's writing center instead of @entity9 were less qualified and less experienced and had received lower student evaluation scores			0
@entity148 said the school 's policies are " unconstitutional and morally indefensible			2
" it 's no pretty solution to have courts interfering in the hiring decisions of universities			0
and as @entity48 has said , it would be " a real horror " if , to avoid discrimination claims , @entity49 's astronomy department were forced to hire an astrologer			0
but that example , like the need for agreement among policymakers , speaks to the merits of the candidate			0
what do @entity9 's views on abortion have to do with her ability to teach legal writing ? for that matter , does liberalism have exclusive claim to righteousness so that competing views can be discriminated against and discarded as unmeritorious ? if @entity9 was discriminated against because of her political views , the law school 's rejection of her was most likely unconstitutional			2
more important , though , it was ignorant			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			1

court heard case of woman who says she was rejected for job for being conservative
@entity194 says evidence showed her qualifications were superior to those of others
she says 46 of the 50 faculty members are @entity146 ; one is @entity22
@entity194 says that rejecting her for ideological reasons is unconstitutional and ignorant
