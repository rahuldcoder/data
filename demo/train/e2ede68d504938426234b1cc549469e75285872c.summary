@entity0 -- with his budget approved by the @entity4 , @entity2 is turning his attention to @entity6 to headline a high - profile @entity9 event that will only fuel speculation he 's laying the groundwork for a potential presidential run in 2016			1
lawmakers approved the @entity16 @entity9 's 2015 spending plan on thursday			0
but there were notable conservative defections , making his appearance at friday 's @entity20 in @entity21 more interesting			0
the question that confronts @entity2 is whether his budget , dubbed the " path to prosperity , " will help pave a path for him to compete in the early contest state in two years			1
or will it prove a political liability when @entity30 choose their next @entity4 nominee ? @entity2 's role as the chief fiscal expert in the @entity34 is the main reason he was tapped as @entity37 's running mate in 2012 , and remains his main calling card in a potential national campaign			1
since @entity30 took control of the @entity4 in 2010 , top @entity34 leaders have deferred to the @entity43 chairman to construct the party 's blueprint to address the growing national debt			0
he has shepherded four budgets through the @entity4 and brokered a deal with @entity49 last fall to avoid another government shutdown and possible default on the nation 's credit limit			0
@entity55 details some say not aggressive enough but that resume has not won over some tea party groups who believe @entity2 is n't ' being aggressive enough about slashing the size of the federal government			2
the group of fiscal conservatives in the @entity4 introduced an alternative budget that balances the federal budget in four years , instead of the 10 years in @entity2 's plan			1
former 2008 @entity9 vice presidential candidate @entity68 , who previously backed @entity2 's budgets , called this version " a joke			1
" in all , a dozen @entity30 voted against his bill , a mix of conservatives who wanted the swifter cuts and moderates in competitive seats who may be worried about political fallout			0
" i do n't think it helps him at all , " @entity80 , @entity81 director for the @entity82 , a conservative group , told @entity1 when asked if @entity2 's record crafting @entity34 budgets could be a basis for 2016 presidential campaign in @entity6			1
@entity80 is n't ready to endorse any @entity34 candidate in the next presidential race yet , but she says there are other activists who will attend friday 's dinner who share her view that @entity2 is n't conservative enough to win the party 's nomination			2
" @entity2 seems like a very nice man , someone i 'd love to have like a next door neighbor , " @entity80 said , but she grouped him in with " @entity101 " who she said " have no clue what 's going on in real world @entity106			2
" @entity107 , president of @entity108 ( @entity108 ) , a conservative grassroots group in @entity6 , said he supported most of what @entity2 had in previous proposals , but he admitted he has n't focused on the details of @entity2 's latest plan			1
@entity2 's dilemma @entity6 conservatives he told @entity1 that conservatives in @entity6 are determined to get the federal budget in balance , and although he understands it may take some time , " you 're going to have some people that are never happy			1
" @entity122 @entity9 sen. @entity9 , who has been making his own trips to @entity6 to drum up interest in a likely presidential campaign , told @entity1 he is " a fan " of @entity126 's			2
but he said voters in @entity6 would have to decide about the political consequences of his budget			2
when pressed on whether he backs @entity2 budget blueprint , @entity9 declined to answer , saying his focus was on the @entity132			1
but some @entity6 @entity30 say @entity2 's willingness to tackle tough issues appeals to conservatives there who are especially concerned about the nation 's debt			1
@entity139 hold the lowest credit card debt in the country , according to @entity142			0
" there is a tremendous amount of affection among @entity30 i talk to , especially with the small business and donor community , " former @entity6 @entity34 chair @entity143 , who is not affiliated with any potential 2016 candidate , said of @entity2 in a phone interview			2
" they appreciate he is n't just saying no , he 's attempting to demonstrate that he 's a solution oriented conservative			0
" @entity2 's poverty push other issues energize voters @entity9 activists and strategists say right now @entity6 voters are energized about issues other than cutting federal spending			1
the backlash to the @entity163 's surveillance program is pulling people toward @entity34 sen. @entity165 , who has seized on the issue , and is tapping into his father @entity167 's infrastructure in the state			0
and the base 's continued zeal to roll back @entity172 is something that @entity9 has highlighted during his visits to the state			0
but these same @entity30 also say the kitchen table issues that @entity2 's budget addresses will generates enthusiasm among caucus goers when the election comes around in 2016			1
" @entity6 @entity30 like somebody who is put forward serious proposals			0
" @entity183 , a former aide to @entity34 gov. @entity184 , told @entity1			0
he believes @entity2 's budget will be an asset and shows " he 's a thoughtful , smart leader , unafraid to make tough decisions and put together tough proposals that do n't necessarily endear him to the east coast elite			1
" @entity183 suggests that it 's time though for @entity2 to move beyond the spreadsheets and the numbers in the budget plans and demonstrate how his proposals will work in people 's lives			2
" if he can explain to @entity200 how it helps them help their pocketbook then he 'll be successful			0
" @entity2 well known veteran @entity6 @entity204 sen. @entity204 told @entity1 that he expects @entity2 to have a " good following " when he visits the state			2
he pointed out that some " economic conservatives and libertarians " within the @entity211 may not be exactly on the same page with @entity2 's approach , but said these groups " do n't necessarily disagree with him but it 's a matter of emphasis for them			1
" @entity30 agree that @entity2 is well known in the state from the 2012 campaign and it helps that he comes from neighboring @entity16 , and shares @entity221 love of the outdoors			0
but friday 's visit is only @entity2 's second to the state since the 2012 presidential campaign ,			1
@entity167 , @entity9 , former senator and 2012 @entity34 candidate @entity228 have been to the state more often , and @entity34 strategists say if serious about running for president @entity2 needs to start spending more time cultivating support there			0
@entity49 are n't waiting until 2016 to put @entity2 's budget proposal front and center in the november midterms			1
while congressional republicans insist the fallout from @entity172 will help them regain control of the @entity132 and increase their majority in the @entity4 , @entity49 believe @entity2 's budget is key to their election prospects this fall			1
they say its proposed spending cuts and changes to entitlement programs are issues that will energize their base which has been deflated because of the series of problems with the health care law			0
dems to highlight @entity2 budget @entity49 sen. @entity252 has called the focus on the @entity2 budget this spring " a turning point " and a " gift " to @entity49			1
in @entity6 @entity49 rep. @entity256 , who is running to replace retiring @entity49 sen. @entity257 of @entity6 , told @entity1 the @entity2 budget will be a major focus as he talks to voters			1
" no matter who my opponent is going to be they 've all been out at public meetings talking about where they stand on these issues - and where they stand on these issues is not very different from what 's contained in the @entity2 budget			1
they 're going to have to own up to whether they stand behind this philosophy of governing , " @entity256 said			0
@entity49 sen. @entity275 of @entity276 may be one of the most vulnerable candidates seeking re-election this fall , and points out that her likely opponent , @entity34 rep @entity279 , has repeatedly voted for @entity2 's budgets			1
" i most certainly plan to point out how my opponent has advocated to raise the retirement age to 70			0
i most certainly plan to point out how some of the proposals in that budget undercut the support for the middle class in @entity276 so i think there are just any number of things , " @entity275 told @entity1			0
another @entity132 @entity290 facing a tough race , @entity293 sen. @entity292 , said " elements " of the @entity2 budget will play prominently in his race			2
he told @entity1 that those @entity9 candidates vying to defeat him have already linked themselves to the " pretty draconian cuts " to education and entitlement programs that he believes will alarm voters in his state			0
dems to focus on @entity2 budget could attacks strengthen @entity2 ? but @entity6 @entity30 believe that attacks from @entity49 could strengthen @entity2 going into 2016			1
" if anything the howls coming from @entity49 are an asset , " @entity143 told @entity1 , adding , " even those conservatives who would want to see more cuts , quicker , when they see @entity2 being attacked , those @entity30 and conservatives will rally			0
" while three @entity30 competing for the @entity34 nomination for a @entity132 seat in @entity315 opposed the @entity2 bill , seeking to show conservative primary voters they wanted deeper cuts , @entity34 senate leader @entity319 , who is battling his own tough re-election campaign in @entity322 , said earlier this week he supported it			0
" my personal view is - i think the @entity2 budget is a step in the right direction , " @entity323 said tuesday			2
he also indicated that most @entity327 backed the plan			0
@entity204 maintains that it 's too early to tell which potential @entity34 candidate has an edge with potential 2016 @entity6 caucus - goers , and he said based on discussions with @entity30 " of all stripes " in the state @entity2 is on equal footing with others in the field			2
but referring to some of the other potential @entity9 candidates who have executive rather than congressional experience , @entity204 said right now there is an " anti-washington feeling which i think gives some edge to governors			0

@entity2 headed to @entity350 dinner in @entity6
