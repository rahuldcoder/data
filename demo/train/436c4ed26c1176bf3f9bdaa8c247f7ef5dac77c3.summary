@entity0 -- most of the world 's 1.57 billion @entity3 know that the @entity5 states quite clearly that , " anyone who kills a human being ... it shall be as though he has killed all of mankind			1
... if anyone saves a life , it shall be as though he has saved the lives of all of mankind			0
" accordingly , it should come as little surprise to any reasonable observer that when @entity19 maj. @entity18 recently committed his shocking acts of mass murder at @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity25 's @entity3 community of over 7 million felt an added sense of horror and sadness at this senseless attack against the brave men and women of the @entity25 armed forces			1
true to form , many conservative media pundits wasted little time in pointing to reports that @entity18 had said " @entity37 " ( @entity38 for " @entity39 is great " ) at the start of his murderous rampage			1
news coverage continuously showed the looping convenience store black - and - white videotape footage of @entity18 wearing traditional white @entity44 garb			1
first of all , someone simply saying " @entity37 " while committing an act of mass murder no more makes their criminal act " @entity44 " than a @entity50 uttering the " @entity51 " while murdering an abortion medical provider , or someone chanting " @entity55 " while bombing a gay nightclub , would make their act " @entity50 " in nature			1
simply put ; murder is murder and has no religion whatsoever			0
professor @entity61 of the @entity62 once wrote that , " one most certainly does insult @entity3 by tying their religion to movements such as terrorism or fascism			1
@entity3 perceive a double standard in this regard : @entity69 and @entity70 would never be called ' christian terrorists ' even though they were in close contact with the @entity73			1
no one would speak of @entity75 as the @entity76 [ s ] ... speak of islam - o - fascism			0
... [ many people also ] point out that [ it was ] persons of @entity50 heritage [ who ] invented fascism , not @entity3			2
" according to @entity85 statistics , there were over 3,400 @entity25 muslims serving in the active - duty military as of april 2008			0
the @entity88 reported that many officials believe " the actual number of [ @entity25 ] @entity3 soldiers may be at least 10,000 higher than the @entity85 statistics			2
" thus , with thousands of patriotic @entity94 women and men proudly serving in our @entity19 in places like @entity98 and @entity99 , perhaps it would behoove our army leaders to consider sending a strong message of @entity25 unity by appointing an @entity94 to be a part of the prosecution team against @entity18			2
this would help show that the mass murders allegedly committed by @entity18 have nothing to do with the teachings of our religion			0
the @entity19 can send a resounding message to all @entity25 and the rest of the world that the social fabric of our country will never become unraveled by murderous ( and irreligious ) gun - wielding felons -- whether it is a @entity3 in @entity22 , @entity23 , or a non-muslim on a shooting rampage in an @entity120 , @entity121 , high - rise less than a day later			1
by appointing a multicultural ( and multireligious ) legal prosecution team made up of military lawyers of all races and religions , we can set a good example to show the rest of the world that our @entity25 legal justice system is truly equal for all people , regardless of their race , religion or socioeconomic status			0
the larger point is that @entity3 in @entity25 completely disavow and wash our hands of any acts of murder ( or terrorism ) claimed to be performed in the name of our religion			2
acts of mass murder , regardless of their time or place , are simply ungodly criminal acts that have no religion whatsoever			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity146 .			0

the @entity22 killings were not a religious act , says @entity146
he says reports shooter said " @entity37 " do *n't* make slayings an " @entity44 " crime
@entity146 says @entity44 *forbids* the taking of human life
thousands of patriotic @entity3 serve in the @entity159 , he says
