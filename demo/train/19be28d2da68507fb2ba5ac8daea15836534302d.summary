@entity0 -- @entity2 and four fans are suing the @entity4 for designating the rap duo 's followers as gang members			1
@entity4 analysts , using law enforcement and media reports of crimes committed by people wearing " @entity14 " tattoos and clothing , concluded in the 2011 @entity16 that they are a " loosely organized hybrid gang			1
" " @entity14 are a ' family ' of people who love and help one another , enjoy one another 's company , and bond over the music and a philosophy of life , " said the lawsuit filed in @entity23 wednesday			1
" organized crime is by no means part of the @entity14 culture			2
" the gang designation violates fans ' constitutional rights , including free speech , freedom of association and the right to due process , the complaint argues			1
people with " @entity14 " tattoos and clothing have been illegally targeted by police and denied jobs because of the @entity4 's gang designation , the complaint contends			1
" among the supporters of almost any group -- whether it be a band , sports team , university , political organization or religion -- there will be some people who violate the law			2
inevitably , some will do so while sporting the group 's logos or symbols , " the filing said			2
" however , it is wrong to designate the entire group of supporters as a criminal gang based on the acts of a few			1
unfortunately , that is exactly what happened here			0
" the group has been battling with the @entity4 in court since 2012 for the release of any information the analysts used to make their determination			1
most of the documents released were online news stories detailing robberies and violence in which " @entity14 " were suspects			0
the @entity2 lawsuit claims that its followers identify with their songs , which " have hopeful , life - affirming themes about the wonders of life and the support that @entity14 give to one another			1
" @entity2 : hate us , do n't hate the fans " many people view @entity14 as nonconformists because of their musical tastes , their practice of painting their faces to look like clowns , and the distinctive @entity14 symbols -- including the ' hatchetman ' logo -- that they often display on their clothing , jewelry , body art and bumper stickers , " the suit said			1
" yet when @entity14 come together at concerts or their annual week - long gathering every summer , they know that they are in a community where all people are equal and where they will be accepted and respected for who they are			2
" the wide distribution of the gang report to law enforcement agencies around the @entity114 " has caused real harm to ordinary @entity14 from coast to coast			0
" the four fans who joined the lawsuit -- from @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 -- include a truck company owner who said he was detained by a state trooper in @entity123 because he was driving a truck with a " @entity14 " symbol on its side			0
another man has been repeatedly stopped and questioned by @entity118 police because of his visible " @entity14 " tattoos , the suit said			0
a third fan was told by an @entity134 recruiter that he could not join the military because of his " @entity14 " tattoo , it said			0
he was denied entry into the @entity134 even after they were removed , the lawsuit said			0
the fourth plaintiff is an active - duty soldier with " @entity14 " tattoos			0
the gang designation " places him in imminent danger of suffering discipline or an involuntary discharge from the @entity134 , " the lawsuit said			1
a @entity148 , @entity149 , theater canceled an @entity2 concert -- known as " @entity152 " -- at the request of police , the suit said			1
the @entity155 has not yet filed a response to the lawsuit			0
" we do n't comment on pending litigation , " @entity4 spokeswoman @entity157 said when contacted by @entity1			2
" we 're aware of the lawsuit , " said @entity155 spokesman @entity160			0
" we 'll decline to comment			0
" @entity1 's @entity161 and @entity162 contributed to this report .			0
