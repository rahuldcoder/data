circumstantial evidence is in dire need of a public relations agency			0
often described as weak and unconvincing , it is continually bashed by criminal defense attorneys as being synonymous with reasonable doubt			0
it enjoys none of the glamour of its attractive twin sisters dna and scientifically based forensic evidence , who even get their own tv shows			0
in truth , though , circumstantial evidence can sometimes be compelling and highly reliable			1
when combined with a touch of supporting direct evidence it can be the strongest of all cases as it does not rely on frequently unreliable eyewitnesses			1
as prosecutors often say in their summations , circumstantial evidence has no motive to lie and no problem with its eyesight			1
in a @entity30 ' courtroom , the murder trial of former @entity27 tight end @entity31 in the death of @entity33 may prove to be a textbook study of circumstantial evidence and its struggle to overcome reasonable doubt and celebrity status			1
prosecutors are meticulously building a case using surveillance video and other evidence to link @entity31 to the killing			1
surveillance video already publicly disclosed depicts a pre-homicide meeting between @entity31 and his friends @entity46 and @entity48 , also charged in the case , at the @entity31 home in @entity51			1
@entity31 is seen walking around with a gun and then departing with his two pals in what appears to be a @entity55			2
later video shows @entity31 , @entity48 and @entity46 making a fuel stop where driver @entity31 purchases what will later prove to be a very important pack of bubble gum			1
prosecutors assert that a trail of text messages and more surveillance video , this time from a vantage point across the street from @entity33 's apartment , show @entity33 entering the vehicle in response to a @entity31 invite			1
later at a time consistent with the time necessary to travel from @entity33 's apartment , a vehicle is seen entering a remote industrial park approximately a mile from the @entity31 home			2
roughly three minutes after shots were heard by workers in the vicinity , the @entity75 with no @entity33 in sight pulls into the @entity31 garage			2
a jury visit to the scene demonstrates the distance from the industrial park to the @entity31 home can be covered in three minutes			2
three men exit the vehicle and the driver , @entity31 , pulls what prosecutors say is a gun from his waistband			1
the video is unclear , howls the defense ; it might be a cell phone			0
@entity33 's body , riddled by .45 caliber bullets , is found in the industrial park			0
prosecutors say they have more video showing @entity31 's fiancée throwing out a trash bag under suspicious circumstances			1
they say she was ditching the murder weapon to help the father of her child			0
and for the coup de grace , the bubble gum reappears			0
a chewed piece of the gum is found in a rental car company trash container stuck to a .45 caliber shell casing consistent with the ammunition used to kill @entity33			0
the defense asserts problems with how this evidence was recovered but the jury may believe that the gum and @entity117 link @entity31 to the murder weapon , which was not recovered			1
prosecutors say dna testing links the bubblegum bullet casing to @entity31			1
both the gum and casing were recovered by a rental car employee during a cleaning of the rental @entity55 allegedly used in the killing and then placed in the trash container			0
and by the way , the car had dirt on its tires and side panels consistent with the dirt in the industrial park			0
under @entity30 ' joint venture law , all those acting in concert to assist in a murder are guilty			0
no need to prove who was the triggerman -- or even a motive , which is conspicuously missing in the prosecution 's pile of evidence			2
prosecutors promise even more evidence hinting that this is a slam dunk circumstantial case			1
but is any circumstantial murder case a " slam dunk " case ? here is what @entity30 ' judges customarily tell the jury about circumstantial evidence at the end of a criminal case : " you have direct evidence where a witness testifies directly about the fact that is to be proved , based on what he claims to have seen or heard or felt with his own senses , and the only question is whether you believe the witness			1
... " in the case of circumstantial evidence , the jury is asked to draw " reasonable inferences " from facts presented			2
the " mailman analogy " is used in @entity30 to demonstrate the concept : " your daughter might tell you one morning that she sees the mailman at your mailbox			0
that is direct evidence that the mailman has been to your house			1
on the other hand , she might tell you only that she sees mail in the mailbox			0
that is circumstantial evidence that the mailman has been there ; no one has seen him , but you can reasonably infer that he has been there since there is mail in the box			0
... " @entity196 and several other states use variations of the rain analogy , which goes as follows : " suppose ... the witness testified that it was clear as she walked to the subway , that she went into the subway and got on the train and that while she was on the train , she saw passengers come in at one station after another carrying wet umbrellas and wearing wet clothes and raincoats			0
that testimony constitutes direct evidence of what the witness observed			1
and because an inference that it was raining in the area would flow naturally , reasonably , and logically from that direct evidence , the witness ' testimony would constitute circumstantial evidence that it was raining in the area			1
" ( from @entity196 model criminal jury instructions ) the judge , in a @entity30 case , then will warn the jury to be careful : " there are two things to keep in mind about circumstantial evidence : the first one is that you may draw inferences and conclusions only from facts that have been proved to you			2
the second rule is that any inferences or conclusions which you draw must be reasonable and natural , based on your common sense and experience of life			0
in a chain of circumstantial evidence , it is not required that every one of your inferences and conclusions be inevitable , but it is required that each of them be reasonable , that they all be consistent with one another , and that together they establish the defendant 's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt			0
if the @entity254 's case is based solely on circumstantial evidence , you may find the defendant guilty only if those circumstances are conclusive enough to leave you with a moral certainty , a clear and settled belief , that the defendant is guilty and that there is no other reasonable explanation of the facts as proven			2
the evidence must not only be consistent with the defendant 's guilt , it must be inconsistent with his ( her ) innocence			0
" it 's still early in the @entity31 trial , but with surveillance video , the evidence of dirt from the industrial park on the @entity31 car , the bullet - riddled body of @entity33 , the alleged removal of the murder weapon from the @entity31 house in a trash bag by his already perjury - indicted fiancée , it appears that rain may be in the forecast when the trial concludes in the coming weeks			1
in the absence of some defense - produced sunshine , @entity31 may soon discover that the mailman also delivers to the @entity289 state prison at @entity290			2
note : an earlier version of this article incorrectly described details of the bubble gum recovered at a rental car location and cited as evidence in the case .			0

@entity300 : prosecutors can often make compelling cases without direct evidence
surveillance video is key to the prosecution case against @entity31 , @entity300 says
