@entity0 , whose portrayal of " @entity6 's " logic - driven , half - human science officer @entity5 made him an iconic figure to generations , died friday			1
@entity0 died this morning in @entity9 , @entity10 , his son @entity11 told @entity1			1
according to his granddaughter , @entity12 , the cause of death was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease			0
his " @entity6 " co-stars , including @entity18 and @entity19 , expressed sadness at his death			1
" we return you now to the stars , @entity24			0
you taught us to ' @entity25 , ' and you indeed did , friend , " @entity19 wrote			0
fans honor @entity0 with tweets , @entity30 salute @entity0 's career in show business spanned more than six decades and included stints as a stage actor , television guest star , series regular and movie veteran			1
he also directed a handful of films , including the box - office hit " @entity42 " in 1987			2
he was a singer ( of sorts ) , a published poet and an accomplished photographer			0
but his lasting claim to fame remains @entity5 , a native of the planet @entity30 whose pointed ears , unemotional manner and frequently uttered " fascinating " endeared him to millions			1
astronaut @entity51 remembered him as an " inspiration			2
" he felt a close connection to the character			2
" @entity5 is definitely one of my best friends			1
when i put on those ears , it 's not like just another day			0
when i become @entity5 , that day becomes something special , " he told @entity58 in 1989			1
still , as an actor , he wrestled with the typecasting that came with his close association with @entity5			1
he titled a 1975 memoir " @entity64			0
" though the book was less a rejection of the character than what he went through to develop him , fans took umbrage			2
twenty years later , he called another memoir " @entity73			0
" he maintained a sense of humor about being confused with a 23rd - century space voyager			2
" i had an embarrassing experience once , many years ago , " he told the @entity77 in 2009			0
" i was invited to go to @entity79 and was introduced to a number of very brilliant young people who were working on interesting projects			0
... and they 'd say to me , ' what do you think ? ' expecting me to have some very sound advice			0
and i would nod very quietly and very sagely i would say , ' you 're on the right track			0
' " to the stars @entity0 was actually born in @entity89 , far from @entity30 , on march 26 , 1931			1
( his longtime " @entity6 " colleague , @entity18 , was born four days earlier in @entity91			1
) his parents were @entity93 immigrants , and he was raised in an @entity95 family			0
he incorporated some of his religious heritage into the " @entity6 " character , most notably the hand gesticulation accompanied by the phrase " live long and prosper			1
" it was adopted from a blessing given by a @entity104 priestly class called the kohanim			0
@entity0 credited writer @entity106 for the phrase " live long and prosper , " a variation of a spoken blessing			2
@entity0 continued to use the phrase long after his " @entity6 " days : on @entity111 , he would close his tweets with the abbreviation " @entity25			1
" upon graduating from high school , @entity0 acted in small productions			2
after encouragement from other actors , he applied to the @entity118 in @entity10 and was accepted			0
he moved to the @entity119 when he was 18			0
his early years were bumpy ; he found the playhouse " disappointing " and left after a few months and , in between roles , served in the military and took jobs such as driving a cab			0
@entity0 eventually gained steady work as a character actor , taking parts on such series as " bonanza , " " @entity130 " and " @entity131			1
" it was a 1964 appearance on a show about @entity134 , " the lieutenant , " that brought him to the attention of @entity137 , the show 's producer			0
@entity0 in 2010 : " i feel very fulfilled " with my work @entity137 had pitched a science - fiction series as " ' @entity142 ' to the stars " and liked the idea of casting @entity0 as the series ' science officer , an alien originally with red - tinted skin			1
@entity0 got the part in the show , which was called " @entity6			1
" ( @entity137 drew several other " @entity6 " performers from " @entity152 , " including @entity153 , @entity154 and future " @entity6 " guest star @entity155			2
) " @entity6 " was never a major hit during its original broadcast run			2
it lasted just three seasons and got the third partly because of an intense viewer lobbying campaign			0
but the characters became indelible : @entity18 's gung - ho capt. @entity163 ; @entity165 's wisecracking doctor , " bones " @entity167 ; @entity169 's chief engineer , @entity170 ; and all the rest of a diverse and -- with the exception of the half - @entity173 -- all - too - human crew			1
according to the @entity175 , @entity0 made $ 1,250 an episode for " @entity6 's " first season			1
though always popular with audiences -- @entity18 remembered being disappointed that @entity0 got more fan mail than he did -- @entity5 was n't a hit with network executives , at least at first			1
his pointed ears made him look satanic , the executives said , and his character was dry and logical , as opposed to the energetic @entity163			0
but @entity0 brought a much - needed humor to the character , with selectively raised eyebrows and deadpan delivery , and he quickly became a favorite of " @entity6 " fans			1
@entity0 even put out a few albums of songs			2
the character has entered the culture as an archetype of an unemotional intellectual ; when @entity77 columnist @entity197 wants to criticize president @entity198 as being distant , she refers to him as @entity5			1
opinion : @entity0 is @entity5 , @entity5 is @entity0 into the movies after three years , " @entity6 " went off the air			1
@entity0 quickly rebounded by joining the cast of " mission : impossible " as @entity205 , part of @entity208 ' secret - agent team			1
in the ' 70s , he made a few movies -- the most notable being the 1978 remake of " @entity211 " -- and a handful of tv guest appearances			2
he also hosted the syndicated show " @entity215 " and appeared in a number of stage plays			0
but @entity5 was never far away			2
despite its short original run , " @entity6 's " 79 episodes had become rerun gold after the show 's cancellation , creating hardcore fans nicknamed " @entity225 " and bringing the voyages of the starship enterprise to a new generation			1
the show was revived for a cartoon series in the mid- 1970s			0
then @entity231 came calling with a theatrical feature , 1979 's " @entity6 : the @entity233 , " which reunited the original cast			2
though the film garnered mixed reviews , it was a box - office success and led to a series of sequels , under the " @entity6 " banner , that continue to this day			1
the " @entity6 " movie series also gave @entity0 a chance to direct			1
he helmed both the third and fourth films , 1984 's " @entity244 " ( which takes place after the @entity5 character dies in the second film , though he 's eventually revived ) and 1986 's " @entity248			1
" following " @entity248 , " @entity0 directed the biggest box - office hit of 1987 , " @entity42			1
" as a director , his other films include 1988 's " @entity252 " and 1990 's " @entity253			0
" though @entity5 kept @entity11 busy and well - employed , he found plenty of time for other endeavors			1
he received an emmy nomination for the tv movie " a woman called @entity260 , " where he appeared with @entity262			0
he lent his voice and appearance to one of the best - loved " @entity265 " episodes , " @entity267 and the @entity268 , " in 1993 ( and later was in 1997 's " the @entity269 " )			0
he narrated documentaries , provided voice - over for video games and sent up his image in some commercials , including @entity276 ads with his old friend @entity18 and an @entity279 commercial with his movie successor as @entity5 , @entity281			1
" my heart is broken , " @entity281 tweeted friday			0
he also took roles in a few other tv series , notably in the paranormal series " @entity287 " as dr. @entity286			0
he lent his voice to @entity289 in 2011 's " transformers : @entity291			0
" @entity11 : " @entity287 " cast impressed me the most and he immersed himself in photography , a hobby he 'd taken up as a teenager			0
his works include " @entity298 , " a controversial series of female nudes , and " the @entity301			0
" ' i would choose @entity5 ' for all that , @entity0 knew how he 'd be remembered			1
he had n't left @entity5 behind , after all : he acted in the first two of the rebooted " @entity6 " movies , playing @entity5 in 2009 's " @entity6 " and 2012 's " @entity305			1
" he and the character were now on very good terms			0
" i am not @entity5 , " he wrote			2
" but given the choice , if i had to be someone else , i would be @entity5			2
if someone said , ' you can have the choice of being any other tv character ever played , ' i would choose @entity5			1
" @entity0 married his wife , @entity314 , in 1989			2
she survives him , as do his two children by his first wife , @entity316			0
