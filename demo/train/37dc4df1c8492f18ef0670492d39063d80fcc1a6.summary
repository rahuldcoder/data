-- a maverick @entity2 artist has filled the main hall in @entity5 's famous @entity4 with 100 million sunflower seeds			1
around 150 tons of seeds have been used to make an inches - thick carpet that visitors to the gallery will be encouraged to play in and crunch under foot			1
the enormous installation , which opens tuesday , is the work of artist @entity15 , known as @entity2 's " @entity16			2
" the work is the 11th commission in the internationally acclaimed @entity20 at the gallery , an annual series kicked off in 2000 by @entity23 's spiders and mirrors			1
@entity15 's seeds are porcelain , each one individually handcrafted by laborers in the @entity2 city of @entity28			1
each tiny piece has been individually molded and hand - painted , according to the gallery			0
sunflower seeds are a popular @entity2 street snack and one of the country 's most famous exports , according to the gallery			1
but they hold greater significance for @entity15 , who spent his childhood in @entity40 as the son of a celebrated poet exiled by the @entity2 communist government during the @entity44			2
he told @entity0 : " it was very poor and rural there , we had nothing else to enjoy			0
sunflower seeds were something basic that everyone could have			0
every holiday , wedding or even just going to the movies , we would all share sunflower seeds with one another			0
i think it 's a very common , very inconspicuous object , but it also has a special relationship to our daily lives ... of course , during the cultural revolution we all knew that the @entity62 symbolized the leader , and sunflowers represented the people			0
so i think these seeds carry multiple meanings			0
" @entity15 is a well - known and controversial figure in @entity2 , probably best - known today for the design -- in collaboration with @entity71 -- of @entity73 's " @entity75 " stadium , built for the @entity74			1
shortly after , @entity15 -- who is one of @entity2 's leading social activists and bloggers -- distanced himself from the @entity78 calling for a boycott and saying the @entity2 government was using them as propaganda			1
in the 1990s , @entity15 came to international attention when he helped establish the avant - garde @entity83 in @entity73 where a group of artists took up residence in impoverished migrant workers housing on the city 's outskirts			2
it became a mecca for radical @entity2 contemporary artists like @entity94			0
other notable large - scale artworks that have filled the @entity97 's @entity96 include @entity99 ' slides which had visitors shouting with excitement as they slid down ; @entity103 's giant projection of the sun in " @entity105 " and a huge crack in the floor courtesy of @entity109 's " @entity108			0
