@entity0 sought to clarify her " dead broke " comment that generated a critical reaction in social media and energized her detractors , saying simply that she and her husband have known periods in their lives when they struggled financially to pay off debt			0
in another interview as her new memoir , " @entity12 , " hit bookstores on tuesday , @entity9 found herself again talking about her immediate post @entity15 years when the former first family owed millions to lawyers and had nothing in the bank as they transitioned to a new life			1
in an interview with @entity24 's @entity23 that aired on monday , mrs. @entity0 said she and former president @entity9 were " dead broke " and " struggled to piece together the resources " for mortgages in pricey @entity27 and the @entity29 suburbs and their daughter @entity32 's tuition at prestigious @entity33			1
@entity9 made the comments in defense of the hefty speaking fees she now commands as she weighs a presidential bid			1
@entity9 told @entity39 on @entity24 's " @entity40 " that she understood the critical reaction to her comments , but remembers that they were " something like $ 12 million in debt " in the winter of 2001			1
" let me just clarify that i fully appreciate how hard life is for so many @entity48 today			0
it is an issue that i have worked on and cared about my entire adult life , " said @entity9 , who later noted that getting out of post-white @entity15 debt " was something that we really had to work hard " to accomplish			1
she also said that she and @entity9 had to support themselves at a young age and pay for college , too			1
" we understand what that struggle was because we had student debts , both of us , we had to pay off , we had to work , " @entity9 said			1
" we have a life experience that is clearly different in very dramatic ways from many @entity48 , but we also have gone through some of the same challenges as many people have			0
" the @entity68 righted their financial circumstances reasonably quickly by capitalizing on the expected post-presidential windfall of book deals and speaking fees			1
the new book " @entity12 " is about @entity9 's years as president @entity76 's first secretary of state , which she stepped away from early last year			1
in her @entity24 appearances , she honed what is likely to be her book tour message -- one of a thoughtful diplomat who is prepared to reintroduce herself to voters , especially women			0
with her book lining the walls of booksellers nationwide , @entity9 stopped at a @entity89 in @entity90 for her first book signing of the two - week tour			2
flanked by @entity9 devotees , many of whom waited overnight to get a copy signed by the former first lady , @entity9 said she wrote the book " for anybody who wants to think about and learn about what is happening in the world today , why @entity48 matters , and why the world matters to @entity48			2
" she was forward looking in her brief remarks , telling that audience that " we have a lot of hard choices ahead of us in our country to make it as great and strong as it should be			0
" outside @entity89 , many in line saw themselves not just waiting for the first event of a book tour			0
instead , they saw this as the kickoff to @entity9 's new political future			2
" i see it as the beginning of her campaign , and i think a lot of people do , " said @entity118 of @entity119 , who waited with her daughter overnight to be one of the first in line			0
" i think everybody is hopeful that that 's what it is			0
so it 's nice to be here at the beginning			0
" security was tight at the event and attendees were warned beforehand that @entity9 would not be personalizing each book and would not pose for photos			2
book buyers , however , were happy to wait as long as they got to meet the former senator			0
" i would love to get a picture , but i understand , " said @entity144 as she waited in line			0
@entity147 , @entity148 , presidential politics on monday , @entity9 was asked by @entity23 about @entity150 , the one time @entity15 intern whose affair with the president in the mid 1990s set the stage for his impeachment and launched a wave of books , tv specials , and yet another chapter of scandal			1
@entity150 resurfaced last month because of a @entity163 essay in which she reflected on her infamy and her life after the saga			2
" she is perfectly free to do that , " @entity9 said about @entity150 's essay			1
" she is , in my view , an @entity48 who gets to express herself however she chooses			0
but that is not something i spend a lot of time thinking about			0
" @entity9 added that she has " moved on " and if she had the chance to talk to @entity150 she would " wish her well			1
" " i hope that she is able to think about her future and construct a life that she finds meaning and satisfaction in , " @entity9 concluded			2
much of the @entity23 interview focused on @entity9 's tenure at the @entity187 , including her relations with @entity190 , sanctions imposed on @entity192 and the 2012 terrorist attack that killed four @entity48 in @entity148 , @entity194			1
@entity9 , as she has done before , portrayed herself as someone who moved the ball forward on diplomatic issues , not someone who fixed everything			1
" let 's talk about what was accomplished and then talk about the continuing threats , " @entity9 said when pressed about her @entity187 record			1
on @entity148 , @entity206 contend that the attack that killed ambassador @entity208 and three other @entity48 illustrates @entity76 administration foreign policy failures			2
@entity211 say ongoing @entity206 - led scrutiny is political and designed to undercut any potential @entity9 candidacy			2
" i view this as really apart from -- even a diversion from -- the hard work that the @entity219 should be doing about the problems facing our country and the world , " @entity9 said , noting that the @entity48 should be " in the majors " on world affairs			2
@entity9 has taken responsibility before for what happened in @entity148 , and she did so again in the interview			1
she also defended herself by saying she " was not making security decisions " for the @entity148 compound			2
@entity39 pressed @entity9 tuesday about her record at the @entity187 and whether she will distance herself from @entity76 if she runs for president			1
" where i disagree with president @entity76 , i will be clear , " @entity9 said			0
" but in many areas , he and i worked together and i think we saw positive results			0
i am very proud of what we did during the time that i was there			0
" @entity206 have seized on a number of comments from @entity9 's interviews and book rollout , but none more than her comments about the family 's finances			0
@entity248 , the pro-republican opposition research shop that , along with the @entity249 , takes the lead in criticizing @entity9 , was quick to ping her over her comments to @entity24 , saying they " reveal someone who is extremely out of touch with financial reality facing @entity48			0
" and on running , @entity9 told @entity23 she would " decide when it feels right for me to decide			1
" she also entertained the idea of not running			0
" i like what i am doing , " she said			0
' @entity12 ' recalls memories , regrets from @entity9 's state years @entity0 in 2001 : we were ' dead broke '			1

@entity9 defends her tenure at @entity187 , pushes back on @entity148 critics
on the subject of @entity150 , @entity9 says she has " moved on "
she says the @entity68 were broke when they left the @entity15 in 2001
she will decide on presidential run " when it feels right for me to decide "
