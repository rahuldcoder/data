@entity17 , whose mother asphyxiated herself in 1963 by putting her head in a gas oven at her @entity1 home while her two children slept in the next room , hanged himself at his home in @entity25 , his sister @entity16 told the @entity27 newspaper			1

" he had been battling depression for some time			0
" she added : " his lifelong fascination with fish and fishing was a strong and shared bond with our father ( many of whose poems were about the natural world )			0
" he was a loving brother , a loyal friend to those who knew him and , despite the vagaries that life threw at him , he maintained an almost childlike innocence and enthusiasm for the next project or plan			0
" @entity5 was only a baby when his mother killed herself , and his father tried to shield his children from the intense public interest in the family			1
some feminist groups blamed the death on @entity5 , who had left @entity6 for @entity70 , the wife of another poet			1
six years later , @entity70 gassed herself and their daughter @entity72 in an apparent copycat suicide			2

as i fed him in his high white chair			0
" @entity35 has written about her parents and her own battles with depression but a family friend dismissed the idea that @entity105 's death fitted into a family trend			0
" @entity83 was n't just the baby son of @entity6 and @entity5 and it would be wrong to think of him as some kind of inevitably tragic figure , " said the unnamed friend			1
