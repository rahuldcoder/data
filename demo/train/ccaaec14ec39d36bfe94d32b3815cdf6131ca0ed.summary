-- @entity2 's fall from grace has left one of the cyclist 's former sponsors not only " sad " -- but also without one of its biggest marketing tools			1
premier sports eyewear firm @entity10 was one of several companies -- including @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 -- to end lucrative deals with the @entity17 when he was stripped of his seven @entity19 titles after refusing to answer charges of systematic drug use			1
@entity10 said the 41 - year - old had been a " symbol of possibility " when he signed up , having inspired millions when he returned to competition after recovering from testicular cancer and then won cycling 's blue riband event from 1999 - 2005			2
he also raised hundreds of millions of dollars for charity through his livestrong foundation before a report by the @entity32 this year left his legacy in tatters			2
@entity36 @entity2 effigy causes outrage " the @entity2 story is a sad one , with our emotional connection with that athlete , " @entity10 chief executive @entity38 told @entity0			1
" we have been very consistent in how we view cheating and we 've always stuck with this over the 16 years i 've been with the brand , so that if the governing body rules that an athlete has broken the rules , we ca n't be a sponsor			0
" i do n't think we 'll change any of our strategic views of who we want to promote the brand , but how that person behaves is critical to having a positive relationship			0
" many people who once backed @entity2 , following years of allegations about his potentially being a drug user , have now expressed their anger at his apparent duplicity but @entity38 said there was no point in recriminations			1
" for me personally , it 's an emotional response			0
i 've never found anger to lead to anything constructive in life -- it 's just a disappointment , " @entity38 said			2
" i can be angry , but it wo n't change the situation , so i 'm just left with the grief of what was a great story			1
" @entity38 said there had been no question of @entity10 dropping @entity2 until he was officially stripped of his titles			1
" we 've had athletes fall in the category before and still followed the same rule			0
once the recognized governing body rules against them , we follow that governing body 's recommendations , " he said			0
" i feel like we 're not responding to emotion , we 're not responding to the story of the day -- we 're following the law			0
" cycling 's governing body has told @entity2 to return a reported $ 5 million in prize money he won at the @entity19 , though it will not reallocate his victories			1
@entity90 company @entity89 is also seeking the return of $ 12 million it paid @entity2 , but @entity38 said @entity10 would not be following suit			1
the company , which has been endorsed by the likes of basketball legend @entity95 , tennis star @entity96 and now golf 's rising star @entity97 , will have to plug the gap left by the fall of one of its most marketable names			0
" i like to think of us as a premier sports performance company and we do really extreme product development -- and sometimes the products we develop are unique and it requires somebody in what we call ' the front row ' to explain to the masses that this is the best , " @entity38 said			2
" so any athlete that we 're targeting to have a relationship with has to be perceived as the best			0
there 's a reason he 's choosing our products -- it 's not because we pay him to do it , it 's because it pays to do it			0
