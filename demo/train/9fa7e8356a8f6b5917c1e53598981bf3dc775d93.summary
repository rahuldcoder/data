-- as riots sweep several @entity4 cities , the @entity1 is cautioning @entity5 in the @entity4 to avoid areas of civil unrest , monitor local media reports and not engage in any debates that might turn violent			1
the guidance , carried on the website of the @entity12 in @entity13 , is part of a well - oiled warning system the @entity1 has used for decades to alert @entity5 living or traveling in countries around the world of everything from terrorist threats to hurricanes			1
monday , the @entity1 issued an updated travel warning on @entity22 , cautioning @entity5 citizens that @entity5 in the country have been " arrested , deported , harassed , and detained " for visa violations and noting that the number of @entity5 citizens arrested , detained and prosecuted for overstaying their @entity22 visas " increased markedly across the country			1
" how does the @entity1 decide when to issue a travel warning as opposed to simple guidance ? @entity33 , managing director of the department 's @entity34 , said " it 's all premised on the ' no - double - standard ' policy			1
" if we have threat or security information that is specific , credible and noncounterable , " she said , " and that we 're warning our own personnel about , we have an obligation to share that information with the public so that @entity5 citizens residing or traveling abroad can make informed decisions about their activities			0
" some people in developing nations have questioned whether the @entity1 pulls its punches in issuing travel warnings for @entity53 countries , especially when those warnings might scare off @entity5 tourists , creating economic problems for the given country			1
" not at all , " @entity33 said			0
" we issue emergency messages , formerly known as warden messages , around the world			2
we issued them routinely in @entity62 , for example , " this summer over demonstrations in several cities			1
" it has nothing to do with the political situation ; it has nothing to do with bilateral relations with the country			1
our primary focus is to get information about a security situation to the @entity5 public			2
" right now , the @entity1 website includes 35 countries in its list of travel warning countries			1
several of them -- @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 , for example -- have been torn by violence during @entity87 demonstrations			0
travel warnings are issued , @entity33 explained , when situations in a given country could pose a risk to @entity5 citizens living or traveling there			1
americans might not be deliberately targeted but they might be caught up in the violence , for example , in drug violence along the @entity5 - @entity98 border			2
" we monitor what is going on , " she said , " in consultation with security experts in the @entity103 , with counter-terrorism experts , with embassies and consulates on the ground who have first - hand information			2
" travel warnings usually are issued in situations that the @entity1 considers to be a long - term , chronic threat , such as crime or terrorism			1
but the @entity5 also issues warnings whenever it pulls out @entity5 government staff or dependents from a mission abroad , even though the turmoil or crisis might be relatively short - lived the next level down in the @entity1 's warning system is travel alerts			1
they are issued in the case of short - term problems , such as hurricanes or upcoming elections in a country that might turn violent			0
travel alerts have expiration dates , @entity33 said			2
" as we approach that expiration date we review the situation and say ' what 's going on now ? is there something that 's continuing ? ' or maybe the local government has it under control			0
we can let it lapse or move that information into the country - specific information			0
" country - specific information , she says , is on the department 's website and includes every country in the world			0
" it 's our version of the @entity151 , " she laughed			0
things like what travelers need to know before they set out for a given country : crime information , road safety , special requirements , unusual criminal penalties , health conditions , entry - exit requirements , dual - nationality information			0
to get the word out the @entity1 uses everything from the latest social network sites to the radio			2
" we leave it to our embassies abroad to determine what is the best way , the most efficient way to disseminate information to the @entity5 community , given the technological capabilities of that country , " @entity33 said			0
in @entity13 the embassy uses @entity176 , @entity177 and other social networking sites			0
in other countries @entity5 embassies may use email or texting			0
in some developing nations they may use ham radio -- " communicating with missionaries out in the brush , " she said			1
issuing warnings and alerts , @entity33 said , can have economic and political implications			1
we " recognize that the host country may not appreciate whatever the message is , " she said			0
" nonetheless , we make sure that the no - double - standard policy is adhered to , explaining to the host government this is not a reflection of our bilateral relationship , this is simply a statement of the security situation as we have assessed it			2
and as we have determined that we need to put this information out			0
our message is our message			0
" the @entity1 's warning system is on their website : @entity207			1

decades - old system used to issue travel warnings , alerts
official : " it has nothing to do with the political situation "
@entity1 says alerts also target @entity62 , not just developing nations
