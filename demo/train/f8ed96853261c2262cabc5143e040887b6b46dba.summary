the @entity1 's new ban on many types of ethnic hairstyles has @entity5 women who wear their coifs in dreadlocks , braids and cornrows in a twist			1
the @entity1 's regulations stipulate such guidance as hair " must be of uniform dimension , small in diameter ( approximately ¼ inch ) , show no more than 1/8 ( inch ) of the scalp between the braids			1
" dreadlocks " against the scalp or free - hanging " are banned			0
" @entity23 " or " matted " braids and cornrows are also considered dreadlocks and " are not authorized , " according to the regulations that were updated this month			2
it 's that type of language , words like " unkempt " and " matted , " that read to some @entity5 , as code for racial bias			2
" these new changes are racially biased and the lack of regard for ethnic hair is apparent , " sgt. @entity33 of the @entity34 wrote in a @entity36 petition she started in late march asking the @entity38 administration to reconsider the policy			0
currently , the petition has more than 13,000 signatures			0
@entity36 petition " we feel let down , " @entity33 told the @entity46			0
" i think , at the end of the day , a lot of people do n't understand the complexities of natural hair			0
a lot of people , instead of educating themselves , they think dreadlocks and they think @entity57 , or they see women with really big afros and they think that 's the only thing we can do with our hair			2
" the updates in appearance standards were crafted , in part , with the help of @entity5 female soldiers and are intended to clarify the professional look of soldiers , said @entity70 , an @entity1 spokesman			1
previous regulations did not specifically address things such as braid widths or numbers , or the definition of twist styles			0
" many hairstyles are acceptable , as long as they are neat and conservative , " @entity70 said , noting the @entity1 has banned dreadlocks since 2005			1
if soldiers are n't happy , they can go through a formal process to request changes to the hairstyle regulations , the @entity1 said			2
" we encourage soldiers to make use of this process by sending recommendations and examples of hairstyles which could present professional appearances and conform to the regulation , " @entity70 said			1
the rules ' conciseness is n't the problem , say some @entity5 - @entity5 women and black studies scholars			1
the problem , they say , is a perception that ethnic hair that is " natural " or not straightened with heat or chemicals is somehow unruly , unkempt and must be carefully regulated to fit within white cultural norms			0
black female soldiers say new grooming reg is ' racially biased ' " in a broad sense , it 's just another example of @entity108 institutions policing black style , " said @entity103 , an african - american studies professor at @entity104			1
" and it 's not that there are n't other examples of such policing among other racial and ethnic groups			0
but , given the fraught relationship between black identity and culture and what some @entity5 might perceive as ' normal , ' it strikes a particularly dissonant chord among some blacks			2
" mandating what should be done with black hair is a particularly sensitive matter			2
during slavery and for generations after , hair texture , along with skin complexion , was used to classify which slaves were more valuable , given jobs in the master 's house rather than the field , and — by default — deemed beautiful			0
straighter hair , lighter skin and features that looked white were considered preferred traits , @entity5 - @entity5 scholars noted			1
those values were internalized and perpetuated within the black community for years in a way that was particularly damaging to the self - esteem of black women , @entity5 scholars said			1
" the gender dynamic here is also important ; hair is so tied to the idea of black womanhood and self - esteem , " @entity103 said			2
" there have been many stories , for example , of the extra scrutiny black women with locs or dreads face going through airport security			0
the @entity1 's ban is just another knock from the dominant society that somehow black women are out of step with the so - called status quo			1
" black pride and natural hair movements have emphasized that all hair types and the rainbow of skin hues are all beautiful			0
however , the @entity1 's regulations , some natural hair advocates and @entity5 scholars fear , might suggest to black soldiers that their tresses must be straightened or closely cropped in order to fit in and be valued			1
@entity1 : female focus group helped determine new hair rules that type of pressure is " both unfair and racially biased , " said @entity181 , an african - american studies professor at @entity182			1
" while it is reasonable for the military to expect some degree of conformity and neatness in hairstyles , those expectations ought to take into account the variety of natural hair textures people have , " @entity183 said			0
" for many @entity5 - @entity5 women who have tightly curled , coily or kinky hair , cornrows braids and locs are styles that allow for ease of close to the head grooming			1
hence , banning those hairstyles puts black female soldiers in a difficult bind with respect to the requirement			0
" that type of pressure is " both unfair and racially biased , " @entity183 said adding that the @entity1 conformity is n't absolute because female soldiers are allowed to wear their hair long			1
" likewise , consideration ought to be made for different textures of hair , " @entity183 said			0
" otherwise , a burden is placed disproportionately upon some soldiers due to an immutable characteristic , natural hair texture that is tied to race			0
