-- our country is obsessed with the perils of attractive young white women , as this week 's trio of high profile crime stories about @entity7 , @entity8 and the @entity9 kidnapping victims demonstrates			1
we do n't see breathless coverage of the disproportionately large number of @entity14 men tried for crimes in our system			1
we see almost no coverage of missing boys , or missing children of color , or crimes against nonwhites			1
this week an @entity14 man in @entity25 , @entity24 , was about to be executed , though he was denied access to dna testing			2
@entity24 , convicted of murdering two college students in 1994 , maintains his innocence and requested the scientific testing , which has exonerated many convicted murderers , including some on death row			0
the @entity33 denied that request and ordered his execution			0
at the last moment , @entity37 letters tipped the balance in favor of a reprieve			0
few media outlets considered the monumental constitutional issues , or even the dramatic ticking clock toward his execution , worthy of mention			1
is n't the fact that we still execute @entity49 without giving them access to dna testing a stunning , significant story ? yet it got next to no attention			0
instead , in the last week thousands of hours of attention have been devoted to every detail of just three crime stories			1
in @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity8 ( whose father is @entity61 ) was convicted wednesday of first degree murder , after the jury unanimously found that she intentionally and with premeditation killed her former boyfriend , @entity8			0
the trial was covered live on @entity68 and followed closely on social media and other television networks			0
the next phase of the trial is scheduled to begin may 15			0
in @entity9 , @entity74 , @entity75 reportedly screamed for help , a neighbor came to her aid , and she , her 6 - year - old daughter , and two women , @entity75 ( who is @entity80 ) and @entity75 were freed after a decade of captivity			1
@entity75 was charged today with kidnapping and rape			0
@entity7 , the @entity14 college student who was convicted , then acquitted of the murder of her roommate in @entity86 , has given tearful interviews in connection with her book tour , as an @entity86 court has reversed again and held that she should stand trial again for the charges			0
each of these cases includes salacious allegations and high - stakes outcomes			1
the @entity9 victims were reportedly raped and beaten countless times over the years			1
@entity7 is accused of killing her roommate as part of a drug - fueled sex game			0
@entity8 posed nude for photos and had sex with her victim just before she murdered him			0
while each of these crime stories is worthy of news coverage -- especially the @entity9 story , which involved serious questions of alleged law enforcement lapses -- many others are equally worthy yet receive little or no attention , even as every detail of the high - profile stories is pored over and rehashed			1
missing children websites carry pictures of many african - american and @entity61 kids who have disappeared , and photos of little boys who have vanished			0
news outlets rarely feature their stories			2
their families grieve their absence and yearn for media coverage that could help find their children and energize law enforcement			2
and the biggest @entity14 crime story of all receives the least mention : that we now incarcerate more of our own people than any other country on earth , or in human history , and that minority males are disproportionately policed , arrested and convicted , and sentenced to harsher sentences			0
@entity14 - @entity14 juveniles are six times as likely as whites to be sentenced to prison for identical crimes			2
in @entity143 , three out of every four black men can expect some time behind bars in their lifetimes			1
in @entity148 and @entity149 , the majority of young black men are currently under the control of the criminal justice system			1
in sheer numbers , more african - americans are under correctional control today than were enslaved at the time of the @entity156			2
our disastrous war on drugs has devastated inner - city communities , and led to large numbers of african - americans being legally barred from voting , jury duty , public housing , food stamps , student loans , and many other civic rights and benefits , often for life			2
we can not fix these problems if we are unaware of them			0
we can not get a groundswell for reform if we are distracted by titillating outlier stories			1
the media choose which stories to make high profile , driven by public interest in those stories			2
we can not call ourselves a nation of equals until we pay equal attention to all those in our criminal justice system whose stories merit our attention , regardless of their race or gender			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			1

@entity192 : americans are obsessed with the perils of young , attractive white women
she says titillating stories such as the @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity9 cases draw coverage
she says a huge number of black men tried for crimes ignored , as are crimes against nonwhites
@entity192 : a nation of equals must focus on worthy cases regardless of race or gender
