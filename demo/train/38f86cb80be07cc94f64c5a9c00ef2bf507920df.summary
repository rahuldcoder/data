-- it 's been a very swift turn of events			0
until a few days ago @entity4 , wanted for war crimes and for crimes against humanity , was at large			1
then , in a surprising move , the @entity9 army general and ex-rebel leader turned himself in at the @entity12 in @entity13 after spending the past few months in hiding in @entity14 in the @entity9 ( @entity9 )			1
for over six years , @entity4 has been sought as a suspect for crimes under international law that include murder , rape and the use of child soldiers			2
on tuesday he was in front of the judge at the @entity24			2
some of us at @entity26 who work on the @entity9 were in the @entity28 to see the proceedings get under way			2
we arrived at the courtroom early			0
@entity4 sat before the presiding judge of @entity33 , accompanied by his defense counsel , which is being led by @entity36			2
@entity24 prosecutor @entity37 was across the courtroom			2
the public gallery 's 170 places were soon packed with members of the diplomatic corps , the press , representatives from several other @entity45 , and various units of the court			0
we sat between representatives of the prosecution and the defense , following the trilingual hearing via simultaneous translation			0
presiding judge @entity54 led the hearing in @entity56 , the defense counsel answered in @entity57 and @entity4 replied in @entity58			2
the judge asked @entity4 to confirm his identity , occupation and that he had been informed of the charges against him , as well as his rights as a defendant			0
" yes , i have been informed , " @entity4 stated quietly			0
he affirmed he was born in @entity13 in 1973 and that he was a member of the military before his transfer to the @entity28			0
from leader of an armed group to a general in the @entity9 army , @entity4 has appeared in eastern @entity9 in various incarnations over the years			1
he is famously known for wining and dining in restaurants frequented by @entity76 staffers and international journalists			0
despite an existing @entity24 arrest warrant , @entity4 was promoted within the army in 2009			1
@entity4 was first named in an arrest warrant by the @entity24 more than six years ago			1
he faces charges for 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for crimes allegedly committed in @entity9 's @entity86 between 2002 and 2003			1
but his decision to turn himself in on march 18 , and the exact reasons behind his " self - referral , " remain unclear			1
though neither the @entity90 nor @entity13 are parties to the @entity92 , which established the @entity24 , @entity26 welcomes both states ' cooperation with the court in ensuring @entity4 's transfer to the @entity28			1
in april 2012 , following mounting pressure from the @entity9 authorities to arrest him , @entity4 allegedly led a mutiny and created the @entity101 armed group			1
we have documented numerous human rights abuses by @entity101 fighters between march and september 2012 , including unlawful killings , forced recruitment of children and rape			0
this first court appearance of @entity4 hopefully provides a glimmer of hope for victims who have long awaited an opportunity for justice for crimes committed in @entity86 in 2002 and 2003			2
in court , @entity4 stated he did not believe the allegations against him			0
before he could go any further , judge @entity54 politely interrupted him to state that this hearing was not meant to address questions of innocence or guilt , but was an initial appearance before the court			0
in his closing remarks , defence lawyer @entity36 said he planned to request provisional release for his client , pending trial			0
@entity4 will join @entity129 in prison , who was his former commander in the @entity132 for the @entity133 ( @entity134 ) before @entity4 went on to create @entity101			0
@entity129 is currently serving a 14 year sentence after being convicted by the @entity24 last year			0
@entity4 's initial hearing marked the beginning of what may become a long process -- the next hearing is scheduled for september 23 , when it will be determined whether or not the case will proceed to trial			1
it is , however , just one step towards bringing justice to victims and building sustained security in eastern @entity9			0
ultimately , it remains the responsibility of the @entity9 authorities to bring all suspected perpetrators of crimes against international human rights and humanitarian law to trial			2
the @entity9 government must fulfill the promise made by @entity9 minister of information @entity160 to fully cooperate with the @entity24 during its investigations into crimes committed in @entity14			1
they must also commit to apprehending @entity165 , the military commander of the @entity166 ( @entity166 ) , who has faced an @entity24 arrest warrant since july 2012			1
however , the alleged crimes of these two individuals represent only a fraction of the human rights abuses committed in eastern @entity9 over the past two decades			1
it is up to the @entity9 authorities to urgently rebuild the national justice system to ensure that justice and reparation are available for all victims , instead of relying solely on the @entity24 .			1

@entity9 general @entity4 appears at @entity24 for first hearing
@entity4 surprised world by turning himself in at @entity12 in @entity13 on march 18
@entity24 issued an arrest warrant for @entity4 in 2006 for his alleged role in crimes
@entity9 government called in april 2012 for @entity4 's arrest for war crimes
