" broadly speaking , his place in history is going to be a positive one , " said @entity56 , a political science professor at @entity58 's @entity57 who specializes in politics and foreign policies of the two @entity61			2
" while it is true that his presidency ended in a cloud of controversy ... he did have a very significant impact in two ways : he took over at a time when @entity1 was on its knees and pulled it out from a tremendous economic downturn			2
and he helped in significantly changing public opinion and popular thinking of @entity1 toward @entity7			0

under a deal with then - @entity136 president @entity159 's administration , @entity5 boarded a plane to the @entity136 in 1982			1
when he returned to his homeland a few years later , however , the @entity136 could not help him			0
as soon as he stepped off the plane in @entity0 , @entity5 was knocked down by @entity1 security officers and dragged back into house arrest			2
@entity5 made two more failed bids for president -- in 1987 and 1992 -- before declaring that he was quitting politics			1
his retirement did not last long and he was elected president in 1997 , at the height of the @entity172 economic crisis			2
his inauguration marked the first peaceful transfer of power between rival parties in 50 years			0

thousands answered , trading in gold rings for cash as a symbol of their desire to revive their country			0
the watershed moment of @entity5 's presidency came in june 2000 when he met @entity7 leader @entity42 , grasping hands and beaming			1
but rapprochement talks between the countries hit a wall after conservative @entity1 president @entity198 took office in early 2008 , with a tougher stance toward the @entity7 than @entity5 and his successor , @entity201			1
in an interview with @entity2 in 2006 , @entity5 looked back on his long political life , secure in the belief that -- despite setbacks -- his convictions were worth fighting for			2
" after i was sentenced to death , people from the military regime came up to me and said , ' if you cooperate with us , we will let you live			0
if you do n't cooperate , you will die			0
