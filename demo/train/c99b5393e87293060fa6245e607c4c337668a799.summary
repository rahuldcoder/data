throughout the @entity1 , the @entity0 relied on the theory of deterrence for protection against nuclear attack			1
@entity0 leaders believed that so long as the @entity0 maintained nuclear forces able to survive a first - strike and retaliate with devastating power against the @entity12 , @entity8 leaders would be deterred from mounting a nuclear attack			1
in retrospect , this arms race was incredibly costly , wasteful and dangerous			0
if war had started , the two superpowers would have destroyed each other and probably all of humanity			0
and the @entity0 never attacked the @entity12 or any other nation to stop them from becoming nuclear powers			1
so , why does it seem that the @entity0 has a different strategy toward @entity26 and @entity27 ? in response to @entity26 's recent threats to launch nuclear attacks , the @entity0 announced it would bolster missile defenses in @entity32 and @entity33 and speed the deployment of missile interceptors to @entity36			1
with respect to @entity27 , president @entity37 said as recently as march 20 : " we will do what is necessary to prevent @entity27 from obtaining the world 's worst weapons			0
'' @entity43 currently has about 5,000 nuclear weapons			0
even though it could retaliate against a hypothetical @entity27 or @entity26 nuclear attack and obliterate both nations while utilizing only 1 or 2 % of its arsenal , the @entity37 administration is acting as if the theory of deterrence no longer applies			1
why ? nuclear weapons : who has what ? it appears that the @entity0 is treating @entity27 differently than other countries trying to go nuclear because it perceives @entity27 leaders as aggressive religious fanatics willing to sacrifice everything for their goals			2
after all , @entity27 supports terrorist organizations , conducts assassinations and bombings , seeks to subvert neighboring countries , and makes fearsome threats against @entity67 and the @entity0 similarly , the @entity0 seems uncertain about @entity26 's young and untested new leader			1
@entity69 not only has a history of provocative verbal threats , but it has taken reckless military actions as recently as two years ago , when the @entity26 sank a @entity74 naval vessel and shelled an island occupied by the @entity74			0
but wait -- did n't the @entity12 spout dangerous rhetoric and take deadly actions ? did n't some of their leaders threaten to " bury " @entity43 and nuke @entity81 and @entity82 ? and let 's not forget that @entity84 launched proxy wars against @entity0 friends in @entity43 , @entity87 and @entity88			2
yet the @entity37 administration seems to think that while @entity12 leaders were deterred from using their massive arsenal , the @entity27 and the @entity26 might not be deterred from using a nuclear force of no more than a handful of weapons at best			1
@entity26 's missile capabilities but if deterrence theory is valid , then this double standard is invalid			1
both @entity27 's and @entity26 's supreme leaders will be deterred , just as were successive generations of @entity12 leaders			1
both would not authorize the use of nuclear weapons , for fear of seeing their nations destroyed , their people wiped out , and their ambitions for themselves and their countries turned to dust			0
if deterrence theory is no longer valid , the @entity0 had better work harder to achieve president @entity37 's @entity113 - winning goal of a world in which no nation possesses nuclear weapons			1
no one can say with great confidence what @entity26 's @entity118 will do			2
while the @entity0 needs to be prepared for @entity26 to act on @entity118 's threats of nuclear war , unless he has lost his mind , it seems doubtful that he would follow through and commit national suicide by inviting devastating nuclear retaliation			2
reaching an agreement with @entity27 seems possible			0
such an arrangement would permit @entity128 to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , but not to build nuclear weapons			0
this is @entity27 's right as a signatory to the @entity134			2
the question is whether @entity27 and the @entity0 can get past decades of conflict , mistrust and suspicions			0
but president @entity37 's threats to use military force to prevent @entity27 from acquiring nuclear weapons do not facilitate talks			0
they only reinforce @entity128 's suspicions that @entity43 's real goal is to bring down the @entity27 regime			0
opinion : @entity26 endgame -- 3 scenarios with a deterrent strategy in his hip pocket as " @entity153 , " a less threatening posture by president @entity37 might help him bring about a peaceful resolution in future negotiating rounds with @entity27 .			2

@entity159 : @entity0 never attacked another nation to stop it from becoming a nuclear power
@entity159 : why does it seem that the @entity0 has a different strategy toward @entity26 and @entity27 ?
he says if deterrence theory worked in the @entity1
@entity169 : @entity27 's and @entity26 's supreme leaders will be deterred , just like the @entity12 leaders
