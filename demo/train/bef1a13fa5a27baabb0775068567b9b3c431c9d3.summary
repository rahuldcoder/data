-- while gearing up to take poison on tour with @entity4 this summer , @entity1 found time to assemble an all - star cast of guests for his new lp , " @entity1 and friends : get your rock on , " due out in september			1
" every song on it is a collaboration with other musicians , " says @entity1			1
" and it 's such a diverse range of people , from @entity17 and @entity18 [ who play on a reworking of the @entity20 hit " @entity21 " ] and @entity22 to @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , all the @entity27 guys , guys from .38 special and @entity29 and @entity31 ' @entity30 [ @entity32 ]			1
these are friends and people i 've played with , partied with , jammed with throughout the years			1
" a new rendition of @entity37 " unites @entity25 , @entity24 and @entity23			1
" @entity25 is the real deal , " says @entity1			1
" he laid down this amazing solo and then @entity24 came in , he did the backups , and i was like , ' just play some @entity24 licks			2
' he did , and that 's what made magic on the song			2
" while many of the featured artists are now friends of @entity1 , they started off as his rock & roll heroes			1
that 's most apparent on his rendition of " @entity52			2
" " i did [ it ] with all the guys from @entity27 , the guys from @entity29 and @entity56 , " he says			2
" that was amazing because probably my first foot in the door as a child was traditional country , then i got turned onto the @entity62 and @entity63			0
then i immediately fell in love with @entity66 rock , which was kind of a perfect mixture of country and rock			2
" @entity1 is n't done recruiting collaborators			1
he hopes to get @entity70 to come in and redo " @entity71 , " the theme from @entity73			0
and after checking out @entity74 in concert recently , he got another idea			0
" i 'd like to get @entity77 to come in to play on ' @entity78 , ' " he says			0
" i think that 'd be great to have him come in and put his style on a song that i remade in an over-the - top , punk - metal fashion			0
" though @entity1 says , " this could be the never - ending record , " he 's focused on finishing the lp and ca n't help but get excited about the prospects of future collaborations			1
" if i was to do another one of these records , it 's overwhelming the amount of possibilities , " he says			0
" i 've been onstage with @entity95 , he 's come and played with poison in @entity97 , @entity98 , and it was an amazing night			0
and last year , i played with @entity100 and partied with him			0
