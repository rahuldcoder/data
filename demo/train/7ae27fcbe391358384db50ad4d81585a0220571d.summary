-- theological conservatives estranged from the @entity2 in the @entity3 and the @entity4 in @entity5 formed a rival @entity7 " province " wednesday			1
the consecration of rev. @entity9 as bishop of @entity11 left many conservatives disaffected			1
leaders of the new @entity15 unveiled a draft constitution and a set of canons for the province -- or ecclesiastical territorial division -- at an evening service at the @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , the group said in a written statement			2
" some of us have been praying for this for decades , " said @entity26 , who attended the service , according to the statement			2
" instead of focusing on things that divide us , we as orthodox @entity30 are focusing on the things that unite us			1
" " the public release of our draft constitution is an important concrete step toward the goal of a biblical , missionary and united @entity15 , " bishop @entity34 of the @entity35 , @entity36 , diocese said in a statement released wednesday ahead of the service			2
the move comes after years of debate over several issues , ranging from interpretation of the @entity47 to homosexuality			1
tensions reached a boiling point in 2003 , when the @entity2 consecrated an openly gay man , rev. @entity9 , as bishop of @entity11			1
the decision rankled traditionalists , and since then , four dioceses and several parishes have left the @entity56 , including the diocese in @entity35			1
the others are in @entity59 , @entity24 ; @entity60 , @entity61 ; and @entity62 , @entity63			0
not all parishes in those dioceses have left the @entity56			1
in all , the @entity15 will take in about 100,000 members , including those from the secessionist dioceses and parishes , said @entity70 , a spokesman for the group			1
" this constitution brings them back together under one church , all aligned together , " @entity70 said			0
" this is all these folks coming back together			0
" the preamble to the provisional constitution says the leaders are " grieved by the current state of brokenness within the @entity4 prompted by those who have embraced erroneous teaching and who have rejected a repeated call to repentance , " the group said			0
@entity70 said wednesday the draft constitution states the province 's core beliefs and doctrine			0
he said it will not lay out definite policies for issues the leaders disagree on , such as ordaining women			0
he said it is " safe to say " @entity34 will lead the nascent province			0
an assembly is likely to be called next year to determine additional leadership , he said			0
a spokesman for the archbishop of @entity103 issued a statement noting the lengthy process of creating a province , adding that in the case of wednesday 's service , the process has not yet begun			0
" there are clear guidelines set out in the @entity115 ... detailing the steps necessary for the amendments of existing provincial constitutions and the creation of new provinces , " said @entity110 , canon to archbishop @entity112			0
" once begun , any of these processes will take years to complete			2
in relation to the recent announcement from the meeting ... the process has not yet begun			0
" the rev. dr. @entity127 , canon to the presiding bishop of the @entity2 , @entity130 , issued a statement wednesday ahead of the meeting , saying the church would not hazard a guess as to the consequences of the breakaway group 's action			1
" we will not predict what will or will not come out of this meeting , but simply continue to be clear that the @entity2 , along with the @entity139 and the @entity140 , comprise the official , recognized presence of the @entity4 in @entity7			1
" he added , " we reiterate what has been true of @entity144 for centuries : that there is room within the @entity2 for people with different views , and we regret that some have felt the need to depart from the diversity of our common life in @entity154			1
" the @entity2 is part of the @entity4 , which is composed of 38 provinces around the world			2
it was not immediately clear which of the other provinces would recognize the @entity15 , but @entity70 said a meeting last year in @entity160 indicated that some would do so .			0
