-- the giant @entity1 , once painted in bright colors , remained silent sentinels as they reacquired the hues of the sandstone cliffs from which they were carved			2
the statues , which looked upon a visually stunning region of central @entity16 for about 1,500 years , have been gone for 10 years , victims of the @entity7 , who destroyed them as part of its campaign to destroy @entity13 artifacts considered an assault on the faith			1
the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) on wednesday will begin three days of meetings in @entity21 about a long - range plan for preserving the snow - capped valley 's cultural heritage and the remains of the @entity27 , which overlooked a @entity29 monastery			1
" they were destroyed in the context of the conflict devastating @entity16 and to undermine the power of culture as a cohesive force for the @entity16 people , " said @entity19 director - general @entity30 in a statement monday			1
a @entity40 professor believes reconstructing the smaller figure is possible			2
@entity19 , which is nearing the completion of an effort to preserve the @entity45 niches in @entity1 and wall paintings , does not favor rebuilding the figures			1
but it does want to protect the 5,000 fragments of what were once among the world 's great artistic and religious treasures			0
today , the massive caves where the @entity27 once stood are huge , empty pockets carved into cliffs that dominate the countryside			0
the recovered pieces -- many the size of large boulders , others as tiny as pebbles -- are stored in several shelters			0
the smaller female @entity45 stood around 10 or 11 stories tall			1
professor @entity64 of the @entity65 , @entity40 , said reconstruction of the female @entity45 is possible , using remaining parts and other materials , according to the university 's website			1
it would not necessarily resemble the ancient statue			0
the scientist said the work would require a small factory to be built in the @entity76			1
otherwise , 1,400 rocks , some weighing 2 tons , would have to be sent to @entity40			2
@entity64 will present his findings at the @entity19 conference			2
the @entity16 government will have the final decision on any such steps			2
the statues survived the ravages of @entity86 conqueror and warrior @entity87 , centuries of wars and the natural wear and tear of the elements			0
in march 2001 , @entity7 militants , using explosives and tank fire , spent weeks blowing up the two colossal figures			1
one was 55 meters ( 180 feet ) high , the other 38 meters ( 125 feet )			0
the @entity65 analyzed fragments of the statues and determined they were once painted in brilliant shades of blue , pink , orange and red			0
they had been repainted several times , possibly because of fading , @entity64 said			0
in 2003 , with the support of the governments of @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , work was begun on restoring the destroyed artifacts			0
@entity19 that same year placed the cultural landscape and archaeological remains of the @entity76 on its @entity116 and list in @entity118			1
" the site testifies to the region 's rich @entity121 school of @entity29 art that , during the 1st to 13th centuries , integrated different cultural influences from @entity127 and @entity128 , " according to @entity19			1
@entity0 's @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report			0
