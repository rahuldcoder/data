@entity0 is a political opportunist			1
his job is to pack as much powerfully charged meaning into every sentence as he can , which makes him a working poet			1
so he knows full well that calling someone a " food stamp president " brings up the working person 's fear , looming reality , and in some cases the actual experience , of unemployment -- while making a shout - out to racism and affixing a stigma to poverty			1
all the while hiding behind the symbol of a flag			2
it is the bane of @entity22 and @entity22 that too often , those who best grasp the language of hatred and fear are those who are most likely to lead			1
this is simply because tacticians like @entity30 are well - versed in the traditional battle - cry and have no fear of the outcome of political civil war			1
why should they be afraid ? they will never be down in the streets suffering with the people			1
@entity30 says his words were misinterpreted , that anybody who criticizes his characterization of president @entity42 is attacking the very fiber of @entity22 democracy			1
he sounds like a lawyer explaining away a crime by influencing the point of view of the jury with doubletalk			0
" it is not that my client is n't guilty but that you can not prove that he is			1
" woe be it to @entity22 when our lawyers become our poets			0
it is the job of the lawyer , poet and politician to stir the emotions of their audience			1
but where literary poets speak of love and loss , the lawyer vindicates and the politician aims to take the reins of power			0
characters are assassinated and whole groups of people are vilified in order that new blood ascend the throne			2
what is most revealing about @entity30 's statement is the nature of the comment , rather than who said it or even what it means			1
we see , at the beginning of the race for president , that our contestants for the greatest power in the world are limited in their choice of tactics , that they must destroy their opponents and , later , those that stood against their campaign			2
how do i know this is true ? because mr. @entity0 is a political poet and good political poets always have their finger on the jugular vein of the nation			1
mr. @entity0 has told me in three words that the battle line will be drawn by fear - stoked hatred			1
hatred and fear have deep roots in the @entity22 heart			2
the original colonists came here to escape religious , cultural and political oppression			2
sadly , these idealistic refugees brought those social banes along with them			0
there was once a time when only white male property owners participated in the democratic process of @entity22			0
there was a time when we slaughtered the original inhabitants of these shores			0
but it was not the landed gentry that made up the rank and file			0
our senators and congresspersons , our millionaires and gentlemen farmers did not have to bleed for the crimes we 've committed and the freedoms we 've attained			0
all our leaders had to do was to locate our fear and greed and hatred			2
these feelings were exhorted in speech and song and catchy phrases			0
once this was accomplished we , the people , standing on sodden streets and dressed in rough cloth , marched off to die for another man 's dream			1
that was then and this is now			0
we -- americans of every stripe , gender and race -- are brothers and sisters in that great and ever - changing experiment of democracy			0
if someone has a better plan he or she should ascend to our presidency			0
if they have lied we should know it			0
if they are corrupt it must come out			0
but we can not allow our emotions to be ignited by hidden messages of fear and hatred			1
this election is about us working together to implement our brightest potentials , not our basest natures			2
join the conversation on @entity179 .			0

@entity181 : @entity30 called @entity42 the " food stamp president , " knowing its impact
a political poet like @entity30 , he says , chooses each word for its *punch* and meaning
@entity181 : in 3 words , he 's sown fear in working people , evoked racism , stigmatized poverty
@entity181 says we ca n't allow our emotions to be ignited by hidden messages of hate
