-- the @entity1 says it is too late to remake uniforms that sport " @entity6 " labels for the @entity5 , though vowed @entity7 would march in clothing made in @entity9 during the opening of the @entity11			1
the announcement friday was an about face by the @entity1 a day after it defended the use of the @entity16 designer uniform , which were widely condemned by lawmakers who questioned why the work was not given to the hard - hit @entity9 textile industry			1
" we take seriously the concerns we 've heard from members of @entity25 and the @entity9 public regarding the @entity1 's @entity28 ceremonies uniforms , " @entity20 , the @entity1 chief executive officer , said in a written statement			1
" with athletes having already arrived in @entity30 , and the apparel distribution process beginning this weekend , we are unfortunately not able to make a change for @entity30			1
we are absolutely committed , however , to working with our sponsors to ensure that the concerns voiced are addressed			0
" what 's really ' @entity35 ' in the statement , @entity20 said that @entity16 would domestically manufacture the uniforms to be worn at the opening and closing of the @entity11 in @entity40 , @entity41 , in two years			2
@entity16 's sponsorship as the official outfitter of the @entity9 olympic team began in 2008 and runs through 2020 , according to @entity1 profiles of its sponsors			1
the controversy cast a spotlight on the plight of the @entity9 textile industry , which has been hit hard in recent years by outsourcing and the economic downturn			2
" @entity16 promises to lead the conversation within our industry and our government addressing the issue of increasing manufacturing in the @entity9 and has committed to producing the @entity28 and @entity61 ceremony @entity7 uniforms in the @entity9 that will be worn for the 2014 @entity63 , " the fashion company said in statement released friday			1

last month , that number was 147,300			0
in testimony before @entity25 last year , the @entity69 said that 98 % of all apparel and 99 % of all footwear sold in the @entity9 are manufactured abroad			2
the news the uniforms were made in @entity75 broke the same week @entity77 @entity76 introduced a " @entity79 " jobs bill , striking a raw nerve with some lawmakers			0
senate majority leader @entity82 , @entity83 , said the @entity1 " should be ashamed " and called for the uniforms to be " burned			0
" initially , @entity1 spokesman @entity85 took to @entity86 to describe the uproar as " nonsense			0
" in a statement on thursday , he said : " unlike most @entity63 teams around the world , the @entity1 is privately funded and we 're grateful for the support of our sponsors			0
" public pressure , though , mounted with thousands taking to @entity97 and @entity86 to demand the uniforms be made in @entity9			1

a short time later , the @entity1 and @entity16 issued statements			2
@entity115 said he happy to hear the @entity63 committee will require future uniforms be domestically manufactured " but disappointed no @entity9 - made uniforms in @entity30 , " he tweeted			1
@entity121 , a former @entity9 @entity63 swimmer who won 12 medals in a span of 20 years , said the @entity16 uniforms -- with their blue berets and blazers and off - white pants and skirts -- looked great but would be better if they were produced domestically			1
" wearing the @entity9 uniform , going out there to represent the @entity9 , it would be nice if it was actually made in the @entity9 , " she told @entity0			0
the @entity1 is no stranger to controversy over its sponsorships , with questions being raised over why it opted last year to extend @entity137 's sponsorship through the 2016 @entity138 , following the @entity140 oil spill in 2010			0
it was questioned as early as the 2002 during the @entity11 in @entity141 about why @entity9 athletes donned berets made by roots , a @entity146 company			2
headlines also were made this year in @entity148 when it was revealed its uniforms for the @entity63 also were made in @entity75			0
the @entity151 responded to critics by saying it was not financially viable to make the outfits at home , according to local media reports			0
some @entity146 lawmakers became irate in 2008 , when it was learned that @entity146 uniforms for the @entity63 in @entity159 were made in @entity75			0
