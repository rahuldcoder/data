-- @entity1 never met a ratings controversy that he could n't massage into a publicity campaign			0
he did it in the ' 90s , when he turned up the heat on the teensploitation psychodrama " kids , " all because the film received a rating of @entity9 ( which it probably deserved )			1
he did it two years ago , when the downbeat - sexy " @entity15 " got slapped with the same scarlet letter ( which it did n't deserve at all )			2
but in the case of " @entity17 , " @entity1 is n't just mounting a pr blitz -- he 's fighting the good fight			1
the movie is a sensitive and eye - opening documentary about the epidemic of bullying in @entity26 public schools			2
it 's a film that would do well to be seen by as many teenagers as possible , and @entity1 had wanted to show it in schools			2
yet " @entity17 " received an r rating , all because the f - word is used in it a handful of times			1
the @entity36 has now decided to release " @entity17 " unrated			1
this does n't solve the problem , since some theaters refuse to show unrated movies			0
so the very audience that @entity17 was made for still might have a hard time getting near it			1
@entity1 hired @entity43 and @entity44 , the attorneys who helped overturn @entity47 's @entity46 , to take on the @entity48			2
the @entity48 , with its famously fusty , punitive , and -- some would say -- arbitrary ratings system , defended the r rating for " @entity17 , " stating that it would n't be fair to make an exception just because of the movie 's good intentions			1
i agree that they should n't just make an exception : they should do a heck of a lot more			0
that the @entity48 is content to keep a film as humane and as deeply unsensational as " @entity17 " away from most of the adolescents whose lives it could possibly help is a folly and outrage			1
" @entity17 , " directed by @entity75 , takes a sympathetic , insightful look at five anguished kids from suburban and rural communities around the country and how the bullying that they 've endured has shaped their lives			1
@entity76 , 17 years old , was so mocked by his peers that he hanged himself			0
@entity78 , 12 , born prematurely ( at just 26 weeks ) , is a sweet , smart kid singled out because of his " fish face			0
" he has been slammed into lockers , sat on during bus rides , called " b * * * * " and " f * * * * * " -- and after all that , it was only really clear how bad the problem was when he stopped complaining			0
( being bullied had become his only reality			0
) @entity89 , a 16 - year - old lesbian , suffered abuse to the point that she tried to commit suicide three times			1
why are these kids targeted ? some of it is based on looks and prejudice , but much of it represents nothing more -- or less -- than the ostracization of those who are lonely or shy			2
they 're viewed as " outsiders , " and then vilified for it			0
" @entity17 " is a portrait of good kids reduced to shells of themselves by a climate of toxic hate and fear			1
there 's only one thing missing from the movie , and that 's an in - depth look at the bullies themselves			1
we 're forced to guess at what has made them into junior sadists			0
my own conjecture is that their almost complete lack of empathy represents the channeling of a larger current of intolerance now at loose in the culture -- the kind you see increasingly in politics , not to mention all over the @entity133			0
arguments against the ratings system have , of course , been made many times before : by directors , producers , and film critics -- and , in 2006 , by @entity141 in his documentary " this film is not yet rated , " which opened the door on the @entity48 's antiquated maze of codes and restrictions			1
as @entity141 powerfully argued , what 's fundamentally broken about the @entity48 is n't the system so much as the thinking behind the judgments			2
the ratings - board members , swathed in their shadow of anonymity , insist on a nearly @entity156 double standard for sex and violence : anything associated with the former ( like the word " f --- " ) is treated as taboo , whereas horror and action films that feature over-the - top violence routinely get a @entity9			1
this outdated distinction may be a reflection of " @entity26 values , " but that does not make it right			0
and the fact that the board tends to go easier on big - budget blockbusters may be the shoddiest double standard of all			2
it 's an indication that too many questionable agendas are guiding these judgments			2
a film like " @entity17 " makes it clear that there 's something deeply wrong with this picture			1
for this is an urgent and moral movie ; there should n't be a puritanical roadblock standing between it and its audience			0
as long as the @entity48 is issuing its cavalier decrees , though , they 're the ones acting like bullies			0
