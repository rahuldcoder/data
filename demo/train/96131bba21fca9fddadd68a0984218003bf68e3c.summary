during the half century since president @entity1 was assassinated , you may have heard about a few conspiracy theories			1
decades of investigations , hearings , documents , records , books and interviews have failed to satisfy conspiracy theorists with a definitive answer to the question : did @entity12 act alone when he shot the president ? at one time or another , doubters of the lone gunman theory " have accused 42 groups , 82 assassins and 214 people of being involved in the assassination , " said author @entity14			1
that 's a lot of paranoia			0
so , when reporters , producers , or amateur historians are looking to check out the latest @entity30 conspiracy theory , they call @entity31			1
" people think i 'm an anti-conspiracy guy , " @entity31 said recently at his @entity33 - area home			1
but there 's one theory that he 's not ruling out			2
we 'll get to that in a minute			0
@entity1 assassination conspiracy theorists , @entity31 said , come in all degrees of interest and levels of obsession			1
they may believe that the government was behind the 9/11 attacks or that the moon landings were fake			0
those folks comprise the " @entity50 " crowd			0
the others , he says , read the books , watch the documentaries and come to less extreme conclusions			0
related : secretary @entity56 thinks @entity30 assassin had help ahead of last november 's 50th anniversary of the assassination , a flood of books about the tragedy were re-released , along with the publication of new books examining various conspiracies			1
the king of @entity1 conspiracy films , @entity69 's " @entity30 , " has also was re-released on disc			1
related : why @entity69 thinks it was a conspiracy conspiracy theorists have been gathering to compare notes at special symposiums , like one last year at @entity76 's @entity75			1
the event , which included @entity69 as a panelist , seemed more like a revival meeting at a sunday house of worship than an academic conference , according to a reporter who was there			1
" replace ' @entity86 ' for ' that 's right ! ' and it would have basically been a church , " recalled @entity85			0
@entity85 said the crowd ranged from those who believed the government was involved in some kind of cover - up , to extremists who appeared to think " everything the government tells you is a lie			0
" she said many still blame the media for failing to uncover the truth			0
and @entity31 , a 70 - year - old retired former insurance claims adjuster from @entity103 , has been digging through @entity30 assassination records since 1976 to address those skeptics			1
doubters ask him to check out the odd stories that pop up : somebody claimed to be the @entity110 shooter			0
nope , he was n't			0
@entity31 says he located and verified the authenticity of @entity12 's long - lost wedding ring			1
" i do n't do the sexy stuff , " @entity31 said			1
" i do n't come out and say , ' i know who the @entity110 assassin is ! ' i 'm the guy that goes into the county records building and looks up deed records			0
most people do n't get too wound up over that			0
" related : still paranoid after all these years over the years he 's come to know several people who found themselves embroiled in the investigation , including @entity125 detective @entity124 and @entity12 's co-worker @entity126			0
@entity31 guesses he spends a " couple hundred hours " each october and november doing research and consulting			2
after all that , you can imagine he 's heard a lot of theories			2
the @entity133 where @entity12 shot @entity1 is now the @entity134 , featuring exhibits surrounding the tragedy			2
" the conspiracy theories are still around because people do n't know what to believe , " said museum curator @entity137 , who admits he 's " not satisfied with the official story			1
" if @entity12 did n't act alone , who was behind the shooting in @entity33 's @entity144 on november 22 , 1963 ? some conspiracy theorists believe " the oil people " may have organized a hit on the president ; others suspect " people who did n't like the way @entity1 handled civil rights			1
" @entity31 shared five conspiracy theories he believes rank among the most popular : 1			1
" @entity155 had it done " @entity31 has shot this one down			1
" it 's based primarily on statements made by @entity158 , " who @entity31 described as a " crackpot			1
" @entity158 -- who died in 2002 -- claimed to have had an affair with @entity155			2
she also claimed that @entity155 had attended a party with @entity164 president @entity163 , fbi director @entity165 and others the night before the attack			1
according to @entity31 , @entity158 said @entity155 whispered into her ear , " after tomorrow , those @entity169 will never embarrass me again			1
" " that 's absolutely not true , " said @entity31 , who said his research proved @entity155 could n't have been at the alleged party that night , debunking @entity158 's story			1
" a lot of @entity177 did n't like @entity155 -- they thought he was a crook -- so as a result , they started creating this fiction after the assassination where he wanted @entity1 out so he could be president , " @entity31 said			1
" but we 've found no evidence , and we know that all the stuff that @entity158 said was contrived			0
the " military industrial complex " did it nope , that does n't wash either , said @entity31			1
" the claim is that @entity1 was going to pull ( @entity192 ) troops out of @entity193 ( and that ) the military wanted to pour more people into @entity193			2
that 's technically not correct			0
he talked about trying to resolve the situation , but he never made a claim that he was going to pull out of there			0
" the mob " did it sorry , said @entity31 , no veracity to that			2
" there 's at least three different groups that they claim independently did this : there 's the @entity210 mob , the @entity212 mob , and the @entity214 mob			2
but it 's all hearsay			0
" @entity12 acted alone as part of an unknown conspiracy " it 's possible there were individuals who helped @entity12 , but who were n't part of any larger group or perhaps unaware of what he was planning			2
" remember @entity226 shot @entity227 and four were hung , including the first woman ever to be hung ( by the federal government , ) @entity230 , " he said			0
" the @entity231 did it " this is the conspiracy theory that interests @entity31 the most			1
" the problem is , of all of them , this is one i ca n't debunk , " he laughs			1
" @entity238 was fed up with the shenanigans that the @entity231 was pulling , " @entity31 said			1
" he found out the @entity231 was trying to kill ( @entity241 leader @entity240 ) @entity240 , which is a fact			2
so the argument is that the @entity231 felt that @entity1 was going to disband them			1
and as a result of that , they were the ones that ordered the killing of @entity1			2
" @entity31 points out that a former head of the @entity231 , @entity248 , was a member of the @entity249 , the special @entity155 - appointed panel tasked with the official investigation of the assassination			1
the commission determined that @entity12 acted alone			0
@entity12 was a supporter of @entity253 - backed @entity241			0
" we know @entity12 was in the @entity256 embassy in @entity257 , " @entity31 said			2
" we even know who he talked to			0
but we do n't know what was said			0
then a few weeks later , he shoots @entity1			2
" " it may have been something that they overheard involving him and the @entity256			0
or , maybe the @entity231 had oswald on the payroll			0
he might have been a double agent			0
" is it possible that @entity256 ordered @entity12 to do it ? not likely , said @entity31			0
the @entity256 would never have ordered @entity12 to kill @entity1 because of his well - known links to @entity256 and his pro-cuban sympathies			2
@entity256 's leaders knew they would have been the first suspects if they 'd engineered an assassination by @entity12			0
it would have been an act of war , which could have triggered a nuclear attack			0
" we need to know what happened in @entity257 , " @entity31 said			0
the answer , he said , may be contained in still - classified @entity231 documents			1
the @entity278 currently holds a number of unreleased @entity231 documents related to the assassination			2
those papers are scheduled to be made public in 2017 as part of the 1992 @entity284			0
" @entity231 has followed the provisions of the @entity287 , and the @entity278 has all of the agency 's documents and files on the @entity1 assassination , " said @entity231 spokesman @entity285			1
" the classified information contained in the files remains subject to the declassification provisions of the @entity284			0
" so , either we already know the truth , @entity12 acted alone , or -- worst - case scenario -- we may never know the whole truth , prompting one more question surrounding the killing of @entity30 : would @entity192 be ok with that ? five things you might not know about @entity30 's assassination @entity30 assassination a collective memory for @entity192 children			1

since 1976 , @entity31 has been researching @entity1 's killing
top conspiracy theories include the @entity231 , the mob and then - vice president @entity155
event in @entity76 drew @entity69 and hundreds of conspiracy theorists
@entity31 ca n't debunk a @entity231 conspiracy theory ; many @entity231 @entity30 documents still classified
