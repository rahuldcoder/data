-- thirty years ago , on the basis of " @entity3 " and " @entity4 , " @entity1 looked as if he might become the most important sci - fi director of his time			1
no matter that @entity8 played @entity9 in " @entity4 , " the way @entity1 made that picture it was as if " @entity12 " never happened			1
of course " @entity4 " flopped on its initial theatrical release , and ever since @entity1 has restricted his time - travelling to the other direction : period epics like " @entity18 , " " @entity19 " and " @entity20			1
" until now that is , when the 74 - year - old has decided to go back to the future , with a movie that 's a prequel , sort of , to his first big hit " @entity3			1
" ironically " @entity35 " starts in the far - distant past , and though the opening shots look like another world it turns out we 're seeing a primordial @entity31 , a remote outcrop off the coast of @entity34			1
flash forward several millennia , 77 years from today			2
cave paintings discovered at this location convince an aging businessman to bankroll a wildly ambitious interstellar mission			2
it 's said that " @entity43 " creator @entity42 only ever had one story idea , the one where @entity45 and crew met their maker			2
it 's giving nothing away to say that @entity42 would have liked " @entity35			1
" so too @entity51 , whose " @entity53 " is an obvious influence			2
as in " @entity3 , " a small crew wakes up from cryogenic sleep			1
the ship has been tended by a humanoid robot , @entity59 ( @entity58 ) , who 's been boning up on ancient languages and rewatching " @entity63 " during transit			0
if he models his forelock on @entity67 , it seems like a good bet he 's modulated his soft , impassive vocal pattern on @entity71 , the ship computer in " 2001			0
" you may not believe it , but next to nothing happens in the movie 's first hour and more			0
and this is probably the most effective and impressive part of the ride			0
the slow , atmospheric ascent to the top of the roller coaster as scientist @entity82 ( @entity83 ) and colleagues ( they include @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 ) explore the mysterious planet @entity90			1
not many filmmakers have the nerve to make us wait these days , but @entity1 knows his audience is primed for exploding chests and toothy extraterrestrials , and he enjoys playing on our trepidation while showing off the stunning production design			1
even so , before long the movie feels rushed			0
when things start to slide for @entity101 and her partner ( @entity102 ) it 's like watching a drag racer spinning its wheels , kicking up dust to hit the checkered flag at 90 miles per hour			0
screenwriters @entity109 and @entity110 have devised some ingeniously nasty set pieces , but after that deliberate build - up it 's disappointing that it still feels like corners are being cut			0
there is nothing to match the shocking biological horror that erupted in " @entity3 , " but you could n't accuse them of giving up without a fight			1
@entity1 has assembled an engagingly rough and ready , workmanlike cast , but does n't give them anything interesting to say for themselves			1
@entity127 's brittle executive officer is just too close to caricature , and she 's not the only one either			0
although she 's likeable enough i ca n't see @entity83 's @entity101 proving as durable as @entity131 's @entity130 either			0
the movie 's stand out is clearly @entity58			0
so it 's too bad @entity59 's actions do n't make a lot of sense , at least not to this perplexed viewer , who could n't be sure if the robot was following orders or following his own agenda			0
the more you think about this movie , the less it stands up			0
@entity1 's philosophical grandstanding is just that ; there 's less here than meets the eye			1
mind you , it is spectacular			0
@entity154 's visuals are lustrous to behold , the @entity152 is amazing , and @entity1 proves adept at handling @entity155			1
this is one sci - fi movie with a palpable sense of space			0
and i 'll say this : even if the movie 's logic ultimately spirals down into a vortex of hysteria , horror and hokum , i enjoyed the bulldozer intensity of the climax , which barely keeps a lid on the crackpot cult movie that 's wrestling for the soul of this multimillion dollar blockbuster			2
it may not be quite the " @entity3 " resurrection we were all hoping for -- wait ! they already used that one ! -- but it 's at least as good as the second and third sequels .			2

in " @entity35 " @entity82 and colleagues explore the mysterious planet @entity90
@entity1 knows his audience is primed for exploding chests and toothy extraterrestrials
there is nothing to match the shocking biological horror that erupted in " @entity3 "
