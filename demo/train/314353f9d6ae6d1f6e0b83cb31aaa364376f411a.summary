-- @entity2 ' franchise reboot boldly went where no @entity4 movie has gone before , grossing a stellar $ 72.5 million from friday through sunday , according to early estimates by @entity7			1
in the film , @entity8 ( @entity9 , left ) and @entity11 get off on the wrong foot			0
that 's the second - best opening of 2009 ( after @entity14 's $ 85.1 million last weekend ) , and it includes a whopping $ 8.2 million earned in @entity17 showings , a new one - weekend record for the large format ( beating @entity19 's $ 6.3 million )			1
what 's more , if you add in the $ 4 million that the movie starring @entity23 and @entity9 earned in late - thursday showings , @entity4 has banked an impressive $ 76.5 million so far -- well ahead of most expectations			1
this result is highly logical			0
considering all the hype and buzz and strong reviews that @entity4 has garnered , it 's no surprise that this film 's opening sum is by far the biggest of any @entity4 movie : of the 10 previous flicks in the franchise , 1996 's @entity4 : @entity36 bowed best , with ( only ) $ 30.7 million over three days			1
moreover , a look at the movie 's @entity39 report card reveals some potentially good news			0
while it drew an expected crowd mostly comprised of older males , @entity4 's solid - a grade shows that word of mouth could be strong enough to bring in fans outside of the franchise 's usual demographic ( i.e. people who were n't alive in the 1980s ... and women ) as the weeks go on			2
unless said folks are too distracted by @entity53 , @entity54 , and all the other big flicks on tap , of course			0
x-men origins : @entity14 ( no. 2 ) was next with $ 27 million on a 68 percent decline			1
fanboy - driven films always fall hard , but this drop is particularly hefty			0
nevertheless , @entity63 's franchise flick has already banked $ 129.6 million in 10 days			2
fellow holdovers @entity64 ( no. 3 with $ 10.5 million ) , @entity65 ( no. 4 with $ 6.6 million ) , and @entity66 ( no. 5 with $ 4.4 million ) rounded out the top five			2
and the comedy @entity69 failed to take off , grossing just $ 4 million at no. 6			2
and in limited release , neither @entity70 nor @entity71 made much of a mark , as each averaged well under $ 7,000 per theater			0
overall , the box office was up nearly 22 percent from the same frame a year ago ( when the infamous @entity78 hit a bump in the road )			1
and , really , what could be a better @entity83 gift than that ? @entity85 , @entity86 ! have a great day ! click here to try 2 risk free issues of @entity0 copyright 2009 @entity0 and @entity90 all rights reserved .			0
