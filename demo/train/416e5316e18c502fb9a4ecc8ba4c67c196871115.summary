-- " the name 's @entity1 , commander @entity1			1
" words uttered by the world 's most famous secret agent who is adored by his country , feared by the bad guys and trained by @entity8 's @entity7			1
i have just spent three years with the @entity7 and written the " @entity10 " commissioned by the commander in chief of the @entity7 and issued to 15,000 personnel			1
i spent long spells at sea on all types of vessel ; i followed officer training with the @entity18 and with the @entity19			0
never have i found a more cheerful , consistent and yet flexible and innovative working environment			1
the @entity7 is expert at planning , measuring and executing -- the key management disciplines ; it does these things highly professionally as it moves throughout the 140 million square miles of the world 's oceans			1
here 's the surprising thing : the @entity7 runs on " soft skills " ( and never on shouted orders )			1
these are the qualities of character and culture that are remarkably resilient and , most importantly , instilled in all @entity7 personnel			1
they understand the uses of commitment , loyalty , integrity , respect and cheerfulness in ways that the commercial and public sector can only dream of			2

and where two groups attempt the same thing , the successful group will be the one whose leaders understand how to use those soft skills in motivating their people and maintaining their effort			1
the soft skills are pretty easy to identify and pretty hard to learn			1
they are a form of emotional intelligence			0
produce a workplace with the soft skills , and your people will flourish			1
and remember that half the @entity7 at any one time might be working in an office ( even at sea or on land deployment ) , so their workplace is much more like yours or mine than you think			1
are you happy at work ? happy with what you are being told to do , or with what you are asking your people to do ? happy that your commitment and hard work are being nourished ? do you work for someone cheerful ? or are you happy to follow a pessimist ? read more : neurotics at work are n't all bad here is the opportunity			2
there are over 1.5 million people employed in @entity95 companies in the @entity8 ; a further 13.8 million in small and medium - sized enterprises nearly three quarters of a million in @entity98			0
all contain managers , whose job it is to do things right , and leaders , whose job it is to do the right thing			1
improve leadership at work , and you improve the lives of over 15 million people			0
and in this current uncertain and fast - moving global environment , there is even more need for leadership of the right kind			0
doing the right thing means three things : looking after your shareholders , looking after your customers , and looking after your people			0
and it 's in the latter where leaders fail			1
they tend to lack the emotional intelligence , the subtlety of character to elicit the best from their people when times get tough			0
these are not matters for management but for leadership			0
so here is the take - home -- or better , take - to - work -- advice for leaders			2
this is military philosophy applied to everyday working life			2
first , develop soft skills and see how employees who are trusted , valued , respected and treated cheerfully actually begin to flourish and prosper			1
in a recession , if money is not the first reward , then improving the individual 's relationship with work should be			2
your people will achieve more with fewer resources			0
second , figure out your ethos or culture -- " it 's the way we do things around here			2
" if you achieve this , then customer service becomes a reality rather than a hopeful promise ; innovation is inculcated into the way everyone thinks all the time ; honesty is not a matter of compliance but a matter of fact			2
third , be clear in your thinking and you will be more efficient			0
the @entity7 works with what the military call @entity173 , which sets out the intent , strategy , resources , contingency and inspiration for any large - scale activity ( it actually derives from @entity181 's order of battle set out a month before @entity182 )			1
the simplicity is compelling because it works			0
and it has been tested in all manner of fast , dangerous , uncertain and difficult conditions for hundreds of years			0

@entity197 never lost a man in the @entity202 , despite being marooned there in 1915 , because he understood his people , got them to make sacrifices for the common good , and earned their love and respect			0
the love and respect found in @entity197 's crew really count commercially			2
a @entity211 survey in the @entity212 last year found that half of @entity212 employees were unhappy at work , and that a third were thinking of leaving their organization ; even worse , 20 % of @entity212 workers were disgruntled and yet loath to move on			2
the declines in productivity from ignoring the soft skills are huge			1
conversely , high - performing teams tend to have high levels of employee engagement and satisfaction			0
they depend on shared culture , goals , and methods ; which is precisely what makes the @entity7 so good at getting things done			1
a survey by @entity234 last year found that employee engagement must be over 67 % if a company has any hope of success : the average @entity8 level is 57 % ( the lowest since 2008 )			0
the soft skills that create happiness at work are not expensive to develop			1
yet we know ceo tenure is short and therefore leadership / business culture -- the vital essence that carries continuity -- is suffering			0
it takes time to develop something worthwhile			0
yet it is a formula understood instinctively by every navy captain , every galley chef , every officer of the watch			0
how people are at work affects how they work			0
if businesses can get this right , like the @entity7 , it will be revolutionary			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity261 .			0

@entity7 runs on soft skills more than shouted orders
soft skills are easy to understand but hard to learn
half of @entity7 may be working in an office at any one time
leaders and managers could learn much from navy 's way of operating
