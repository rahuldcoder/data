" it 's a challenge to local leaders to follow the evidence and to use the resources to see what works on our kids , " the president said			2
" we need to help our communities , our law enforcement build trust , build understanding , so that our neighborhoods stay safe and our young people stay on track			0
" the operation was originally launched with the plan to have leading foundations and businesses donate at least $ 200 million over five years toward mentoring programs aimed at boys and young men of color			0
@entity3 also thanked attorney general @entity91 , who announced his retirement last week , for his continued effort to improve race relations and advance civil rights			1
