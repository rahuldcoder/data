@entity0 , the @entity1 -- a debate is stirring in the predominantly @entity5 country of the @entity1 : should the government provide contraceptives to the public ? @entity9 , a 25 - year - old maid with five children , said she would not use contraceptives			1
more than 100 members of the @entity12 have co-authored a bill that would allow government funds to be used to promote artificial contraceptives -- which is now prohibited in the @entity17 nation			1
" the bill is not about religion			1
it is not about morality , " said @entity20 , a congressman			0
" it 's about rights , health and sustainable human development			1
" some one - third of the country 's 90 million people live in poverty			1
the @entity30 said that problem will persist until the country curbs its birth rate -- one of the highest in the world			1
the nationwide @entity36 found nearly two - thirds of people support the bill			1
but the @entity5 is fiercely opposed , and is pressuring lawmakers to vote against it			1
" why should we use contraceptives , teaching our children the use of contraceptives , " said @entity42 of pro-life @entity1			1
" it 's totally against the teaching of the @entity5			2
the poverty is really caused by other issues , moral values			2
" " when you talk about natural family planning , it needs discipline , that 's where many couples fail			2
" abortion is illegal in the @entity1 , except in cases to save a mother 's life			2
but the @entity67 estimates that half a million illegal abortions are performed in the country every year			1
@entity9 , a 25 - year - old maid earning $ 2 a day , has five children			2

i had my first baby by the time i was nineteen			0
then the babies came , one after the other , " she said			0
" life is so hard , kids get sick easily , prices of goods are so high			0
that 's one of the reasons why i do n't want them to have too many kids , " she said			0
still , @entity9 said she would not use contraceptives			0
" even if they say you 'll end up with too many kids , i do n't get swayed by their persuasions , i wo n't use those contraceptives , " she said			0
the legislation will go before the nation 's @entity89 in the next few months			1
" this bill , once it becomes a law , it will give information and access to those who want it , " @entity20 said			0
" but i will also underscore that central to this bill is the freedom of choice			0
... ( @entity101 ) e compel women to make their own choices			0
" " ( @entity106 ) he government should be there to give them free information and free access to the products , particularly to the poorer of the poor , " he added .			0
