-- when most people look at @entity3 , they see the incarnation of evil			1
among its many horrific acts , the @entity7 militant group beheaded @entity10 journalist @entity9 and posted the video this week in retaliation for @entity10 airstrikes in @entity14			0
the @entity15 typically protests violence , but he implied that he supports the use of military force to combat @entity3			1
even @entity19 says @entity3 is too violent			1
across the political spectrum , public officials and pundits have characterized them as " savages , " a " cancer " and the " face of evil			2
" is @entity3 evil ? the problem with that question is that the answer is as easy as it is useless			1
yes , @entity3 is evil and must be stopped			1
saying so over and over again could very well make it harder to stop them			0
there is only one good reason to denounce a group as evil -- because you plan to injure them , and calling them evil makes it psychologically easier to do so			2
" @entity44 " is the most powerful word we have to prepare ourselves to kill other people comfortably			1
the flip side is that " evil " is also a word that stops us from thinking			1
there is no point in trying to understand evil because it is , in the most typical phrasing , " inhuman , " " senseless " or " beyond comprehension			1
" it is a fool 's quest to analyze the local realities and strategic imperatives of unthinking savages			2
there is something almost offensive about trying to understand such evil			1
@entity60 's @entity59 tried to shame those who are trying to think seriously about @entity3			1
in a recent tweet , he mocked the attempt to understand @entity3 in its social and political context , suggesting that we should focus instead on one fact : " they 're evil			1
they do obviously evil things for evil ends			2
" the fact is , there are few things more dangerous now than allowing ourselves to think that way			0
to resist @entity3 and , perhaps more importantly , the larger social forces it represents , the @entity10 will need more than a collective psychological readiness to injure , and more than bombs			1
the @entity79 editorialized that this evil ideology will only be stopped when " enough of its fanatics have been killed			2
" but if we 've learned anything as a nation since our " shock and awe " campaign in @entity14 , it is this : while invasions and bombing can be effective in the short term , they are not durable solutions to terror - based violence			0
even if @entity10 military force could effectively destroy @entity3 , there will be similar groups waiting in the wings			1
if we are to have any hope of preventing the spread of extremist ideologies , we must do more than bomb the believers			0
we must be willing to continue thinking			0
how is @entity3 able to achieve the support it needs ? what drives people into its ranks ? what social pressures and needs , what political and regional vacuums , make it possible for a group like this to thrive ? we can choose to answer these questions in two ways			1
we can say they are evil people doing evil things for evil ends			2
or we can do the hard work of understanding the context that made them , so that we can create a context that unmakes them			0
we can analyze the ways its violent tactics are effective for its purposes given the local power dynamics , so that we can also better understand its weak spots			0
and we can ask how it is that normal men -- men who were not born evil -- get turned into monsters , so that we can work to change the structures that produce terrorists over the long term instead of locking ourselves into an endlessly repeated , short - term policy of " killing fanatics " until they are gone			0
trying to understand something is n't the same as trying to justify or excuse it			0
that 's a basic mistake , and a costly one			0
as @entity146 , president of the @entity147 , recently wrote : " we ca n't counter radical narratives if we do n't understand the motives of the radicalized			0
" nonetheless , trying to understand evil is an offense			2
it is an offense to everything we hold dear , because understanding -- that is , true and effective understanding -- must bring us close to the other , must help us see the world through their eyes			0
that is a painful , offensive process , and that is exactly what we must do .			0

@entity165 : evil is the strongest word we have to prepare ourselves to kill others
@entity170 : but the flip side is that it 's also a word that stops us from thinking
he says even if we can destroy @entity3 , there will be other groups waiting in the wings
@entity170 : if we want to prevent spread of extremism , we must understand the people
