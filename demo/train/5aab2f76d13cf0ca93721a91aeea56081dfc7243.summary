-- @entity1 announced a new platform wednesday for its business - focused social networking site -- offering websites and developers easy tools to embed " recommend " buttons , company - profile boxes and contact widgets on third - party websites -- as well as a way to log in to other sites using @entity1			1
calling it " a new platform for building the professional web , " @entity1 is seeking to challenge @entity14 's growing control over online identity			1
once just a site for sharing photos and updates with friends , @entity14 has woven itself into the fabric of the net with its open graph platform , that lets other websites embed @entity14 widgets , install " like " buttons , plug - in a commenting system , and let users log in with their @entity14 credentials			1
though @entity1 's new platform does n't mention @entity14 by name , the term " professional web " clearly shows the company trying to position itself as a more mature and respectable alternative to @entity14			1
the new tools rely on @entity38 and the oauth 2.0 system for logins ( the same as used by @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , among others )			0
among the offerings : -- a share button that posts a link to a page or news story to the user 's feed on @entity1			0
-- a recommend button to give a vote to a product you like			0
wired : linkedin scores $ 53 million -- member profile widgets that show the @entity1 profile of a company executive or website owner			2
@entity1 's share button joins a growing number of plugins that try to get users to spread the news about a site or news story , a pantheon that includes @entity69 , @entity43 's @entity43 button , and social voting and submission widgets from @entity73 and @entity74			1
for those who run their own blogs or websites , @entity1 is making it simple to show off a snippet of your @entity1 profile and for visitors logged into @entity1 , they 'll see thumbnails of connections they have in common			0
companies can also embed widgets that shows off employee profiles or profiles of companies featured on their site or in a news story , showing off the ones that are " in " your network			0
the box can also be configured to show off key information about the company -- and a link to its official @entity1 page -- instead of employee profiles			0
wired : @entity1 to lay of 10 % of staff it 's a powerful challenge			2
@entity1 has a solid and growing user base , one that 's shown it 's willing to pay for extra features			0
the company is preparing for an ipo , and extending the power of @entity1 's focus on business , not pleasure , outside of its online walls could help the company grow into a powerful competitor to @entity14			1
wired : let ipos bloom again -- @entity1 files with @entity117 it would be the " real world " site that people graduate to , from the college fun of @entity14			2
unfortunately , @entity1 's platform faces the tough challenge of coming almost a year after @entity14 debuted its @entity126 button and its @entity127			1
in social networking years , it feels like almost a decade , and @entity1 will have to work hard to convince websites and busy developers that it 's worth their time to graduate to the " professional web , " as well			2
