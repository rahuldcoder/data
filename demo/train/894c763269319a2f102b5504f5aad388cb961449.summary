@entity0 , a @entity8 who starred for the @entity10 for 17 seasons , and 14 other former players filed a civil lawsuit in federal court that says the league knew for years there was a link between concussions and long - term health problems			1
the document asks for monetary damages to be determined at a jury trial and for medical monitoring for the former players			0
each player submitted a short - form complaint that contained standard language that they suffer from brain injuries and exhibit symptoms that have developed over time			0
@entity0 joining lawsuit changes everything the document does n't specify the nature of @entity0 's injuries			1
the @entity4 did n't immediately respond to @entity37 's request for comment			2
@entity0 , 52 , was considered one of the most durable quarterbacks in the @entity4 and once started 99 games in a row			1
known for a quick release , @entity0 still holds several @entity4 records			2

@entity0 and 14 other players are the latest group to sue the @entity4
they say the league knew concussions came with health consequences
the lawsuit does n't list what *happened* to @entity0
in january , a judge *ruled* a settlement between @entity4 , other *ex-players* was inadequate
