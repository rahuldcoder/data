-- " @entity1 " had some fun recently at the expense of undecided voters			1
@entity5 took it a step further on his @entity9 show " @entity10 , " calling those who have yet to make up their minds in the presidential election " ignorant			2
" the jokes may be funny , but both campaigns are taking the final phase of the election season very seriously			1
the stakes are high in the first debate between president @entity20 and @entity21 , set for wednesday night in @entity22			1
as @entity25 gov. @entity24 said so aptly over the weekend , " this whole race is going to be turned upside down come thursday morning			0
" opinion : @entity20 , light a cig ; @entity21 , throw deep that 's not just @entity25 bluster			1
both @entity20 and @entity21 are hoping to land a knockout punch -- a moment where they can break through for good			1
for viewers everywhere , expect great drama			2
undecideds the notion that the final month of the election may not matter is , well , ignorant			0
presidential debates can make a difference			1
opinion : swing voters want to hear specifics let 's look back to 2000			0
the final debate was " enough to turn a neck - and - neck race into a solid lead for @entity49 @entity48 gov. @entity47 " over @entity50			0
what did it ? " the debate appears to have made @entity49 more enthusiastic about voting while turning some @entity54 away from the polls , " according to a @entity0 poll at the time			0
after the second presidential debate of the cycle , @entity0 wrote that @entity65 sen. @entity64 " appears to be holding the ground he gained against president @entity47 after the first presidential debate			2
" it tightened a race that was at one point looking like a @entity47 runaway			0
( true , @entity47 won most of electoral votes , but the difference in popular votes was within 3 percentage points			0
) @entity5 and @entity1 can poke fun at the undecided voters , but these people matter -- especially in a tight race like the one between @entity20 and @entity21 -- since they make up a small but solid percentage of the electorate			1
the undecideds will have three more chances to make a decision , including a debate on october 16 that will be moderated by " @entity84 " anchor @entity83			2
@entity85 recently , 40 % of @entity90 " say they are not too or not at all satisfied , marking the lowest level of candidate satisfaction since the 1992 presidential election			0
" that 's a lot of @entity90 who are n't ready to enthusiastically embrace a candidate or start convincing their friends that their choice is the right one			0
what about the last presidential election ? in 2008 , 72 % of voters said they were satisfied with the choices , perhaps because both @entity20 and @entity100 were dynamic			1
what does this mean for 2012 ? namely , that a big voting bloc is waiting for the candidates to prove their worth			0
opinion : why debate is crucial for @entity20 , too the unsatisfieds are voters who feel their needs are not being met by the campaign stump speeches and talking points			1
@entity0 's @entity113 took a look at these " slivers " of voters			0
@entity117 profiled a man who voted for @entity20 in 2008 but has grown disillusioned			2
this man has a specific list of items that he finds politically appealing , but neither campaign has satisfied him so far			0
he plans to tune in to the debates which may sway him			2
late deciders like the unsatisfied voters , there is a group of voters who have n't started to pay attention to the race			1
they 're not glued to the 24 - hour news cycle of cable tv or the blogosphere			0
they 're not remotely as invested as the inside - the - beltway crowd			0
but they do vote , and the debates are a critical last - minute stop for them			0
opinion : will candidates let returning troops fall off the fiscal cliff ? in the 2004 election , which at first looked like a big @entity47 victory before the debates in the last month , 10 % of voters said they decided in the final 30 days , and @entity64 captured 54 % to @entity47 's 44 % of this group			1
similarly , in the 2008 race , 15 % of the voters made their decision in the last month , with more than 50 % going for @entity20			1
in 1996 , @entity156 received more of the last - minute deciders			0
@entity158 there 's one more category of people who @entity20 and @entity21 will be looking to lock up during the debates			1
these are the persuadable voters			0
they are voters who lean one way or the other but are n't sure whether they will cast a ballot			0
in the latest @entity0 poll , a large percentage of respondents fell into this category			0
among @entity20 supporters , 26 % of likely voters " moderately " support him while 30 % of registered voters " moderately " support him			1
among @entity21 supporters , 28 % of likely voters " moderately " support him and 35 % of registered voters support him			1
these numbers are not insignificant			0
in a race that involves both rallying the base and attracting independents , especially in the swing states , turning moderate support to strong support as well as registered voters to likely voters can be a key to victory			0
2012 finale like any election , this one is defined by key moments			2
certainly , @entity21 's victory in the primary was one			2
@entity21 and @entity193 's speeches at the @entity194 -- and , likewise , @entity20 and @entity195 's at the @entity196 -- were as well			1
since the conventions @entity54 have gained ground and a secretly taped video of @entity21 's offhand comments about 47 % of @entity90 not paying taxes has surfaced			2
it would be surprising if @entity20 does n't allude to @entity21 's comment in some way , even if in passing			1
opinion : @entity21 's best bet is to be mr. fix - it on the foreign policy front , a terrorist attack in @entity210 on september 11 left a @entity90 ambassador dead , and questions remain glaringly unanswered regarding the @entity20 administration 's handling of security in @entity210			1
@entity21 is expected to bring up this issue			2
back in late february was the " season finale " of the primary debates , which in retrospect seemed like the ultimate reality show with more twists and turns than a " @entity224 " reunion			1
now we get the season premiere of the general election debates with four highly anticipated episodes before the 2012 series finale			1
the comedy shows can have their fun -- but the real drama begins tonight in @entity22			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			0
