-- i went out on a limb the other day and said @entity3 should not be behind bars			1
you would think i had issued a declaration of war			0
and maybe , the way some folks look at it , i had			0
my defense of the " @entity11 " moderator followed the much - publicized spectacle in which he brandished on the air a high - capacity magazine during an interview with the @entity17 's chief executive			1
this was , to be sure , something of a stunt			0
it made for a great visual			0
it gave @entity3 a prop as he asked @entity25 whether , if 30 - bullet magazines like the one in his hand were banned , " is n't it just possible that we could reduce the carnage in a situation like @entity30 ? " next , as you 've probably heard , came word that the police department in @entity37 was investigating @entity3 for a potential violation of the city 's gun laws			1
possession of high - capacity magazines is illegal in @entity37 , even if they are empty			1
it did n't help matters when the police said that @entity47 had asked for permission to show the ammunition on the air and was turned down			2
nor has @entity47 's silence on the matter aided @entity3 's case			1
watch : is @entity54 a ' pretend journalist ' for @entity47 ? but let 's get real here			0
@entity3 's only intent was to commit journalism			1
why are the cops wasting time on this , other than as a @entity62 gesture to demonstrate that they 're somehow on the case ? it 's fine to lambaste what @entity3 did on the air			2
he walked right up to the line , and some would say crossed it , of pushing @entity25 to acknowledge that some form of gun control would be sensible			1
and maybe holding up ammunition for the cameras was grandstanding			0
watch : twitter filled with sickening death wishes for @entity76 but there is a vitriol in the many messages , tweets and posts accusing me of not understanding that a journalist is n't above the law			2
on that point , i could n't agree more			2
but would a regular person be prosecuted for carrying a magazine with no bullets if no violence was involved ? even the @entity91 's conservative editorial page agrees that going after @entity3 makes no sense			1
what 's striking here is that gun enthusiasts often make the argument that they just want government to leave them alone , yet seem perfectly comfortable unleashing it against a member of the mainstream media , supporting the @entity101 by trashing the @entity102			2
the same kind of animus has been directed at @entity0 's @entity105 , an outspoken advocate of gun control			1
for no other reason than that they do n't like his views , more than 90,000 people have signed a petition calling for the @entity114 journalist to be deported			1
watch : should @entity47 's @entity3 be jailed for waving ammunition on air ? the petition is meaningless , except in this respect : as a demonstration that so many people would support kicking someone out of the country for purely political reasons , without even the fig leaf of a technical offense			1
can @entity105 be overbearing ? it was not his finest hour when he questioned during an interview whether gun rights advocate @entity128 is an " unbelievably stupid man			1
" he 's fair game for equally strong criticism in return			0
but deportation is way out there as a remedy for media advocacy			0
@entity105 has handled the situation with humor , tweeting : " still only 90,000 @entity139 have signed the @entity141 petition to deport me			1
that leaves 310,910,000 who presumably want me to stay			0
" emotions are obviously raw in the aftermath of the @entity147 tragedy , which saw 20 young and defenseless children gunned down			0
watch : from @entity149 to @entity150 , a 2012 media report card those who believe that guns are being unfairly blamed , led by the @entity17 , are lashing out at politicians , video game makers , entertainment conglomerates and , of course , the media			0
to the extent that leading journalists are in the forefront of this debate , they are feeling the sting of that anger			0
the uproar against the @entity168 newspaper for printing a map of gun permit owners in two suburban @entity172 counties , which i view as violating their privacy without a good reason , can attest to that			2
it 's hardly surprising that things are getting heated , given the emotional intensity of the gun issue			0
but proclamations about locking up and banishing journalists deserve to be seen as little more than outlandish chatter			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2

@entity186 : emotion over gun control battle is *trumping* reason
he says it makes no sense to arrest @entity3 for possessing a high - capacity clip
@entity105 is target of a deportation petition signed by 90,000 people
@entity186 says journalists should n't be *threatened* for doing their job
