-- @entity2 's three eldest daughters looked at her with concern			1
they were beautiful , she thought , with their slim , athletic builds and porcelain skin			1
she had n't wanted them to deal with the pain of being overweight , so she had taught them to eat nutritious foods and stay active			1
now they were throwing those lessons back in her face			1
@entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 tried to pitch their " intervention " like a fun plan			1
they bought their mom a gym membership and some new workout clothes			1
they tried to avoid talking about her weight problem directly , but eventually the truth came out			1
" it was terrible , " @entity13 remembers			2
" it 's never something you want to bring up , especially to your mom			2
but really it was just hurting us to see her like that			2
we did n't want to have to worry about her dying			2
" their mother was 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighed more than 200 pounds			1
she had become isolated and never wanted to participate in family get - togethers			2
the older girls were worried their youngest sister @entity41 , 5 at the time , would n't get to know the wonderful , energetic mom with whom they had grown up			2
i was crying , " @entity2 says			1
" it really hurt my feelings			2
... i was like , ' i know i 'm heavy			2
i know that , but i 'm not unhealthy			2
i 'm just supposed to be that weight			2
' " they were like , ' @entity49 , i do n't think that 's true			2
' " ' i was trying to lose weight ' @entity2 is n't sure how she put on so much weight			1
she was chubby as a child , and her weight fluctuated throughout adulthood			2
she did n't eat a lot of bad foods , staying away from fast food and fried fare			2
but she rarely exercised and says she has a slow metabolism			2
shortly after @entity64 's birth , @entity2 and her husband divorced			1
stress , combined with an unusual work schedule and a new baby , kept the pounds on despite multiple attempts at dieting			1
" it was discouraging because i was n't just pretending like i did n't know i needed to lose weight , " she says			0
" i was trying to lose weight			0
i wanted something to change			0
" unfortunately , her daughters ' intervention did n't work			1
it was n't until @entity14 and @entity13 's college graduation nearly six years later that she really took a good look in the mirror			0
she was thrilled for her daughters and proud to be their mother , but she was n't proud of the way she looked			1
she weighed close to 230 pounds			1
she dreaded meeting their college friends and taking a million photos			0
on the way home -- embarrassed and miserable -- @entity2 thought about what she could do			1
a few years earlier , her new husband had bought a @entity89			0
it was sitting in their @entity92 house , practically unused			0
she promised herself she would start walking on it three times a week , for 20 minutes			1
and that 's what she did			0
at the end of september 2011 , she met her daughters at @entity99 , an amusement park in @entity100 , for an annual trip			1
the girls noticed she had lost a bit of weight and complimented her			0
" i was excited , but i did n't really want to ... make a huge deal of it because i did n't want her to feel like we were adding pressure , " @entity13 says			0
the girls ' comments encouraged @entity2			1
she added another day to her routine , then another			0
soon she was walking for 45 minutes , six days a week			1
the more she exercised , the more she was conscious of what she was eating			0
she started writing down her meals in a journal to get an idea of how much she was consuming each day			0
her goal was to go from a size 20 to a size 12			1
by may 2012 , she was a size 2/4			1
she had lost more than 110 pounds in about 10 months			1
" she was ready to take on the world , " @entity13 says			1
" she wanted to go out and do all these things			0
... it was like having our old mom back			0
" have you lost weight ? share your story on @entity130 raiding daughters ' closets fun when she was overweight , @entity2 says she never felt bad physically			1
" i did whatever i wanted to do , but i did n't want to do that much , " she says with a laugh			0
today she says she feels " 100 % better			0
" " she has more energy than we do now , " @entity13 says			0
" she 's just very inspiring , and she just keeps going , and i love her for that			0
" @entity2 was laid off before she jumped on the @entity137			1
she went on multiple job interviews that amounted to nothing			0
but her first interview after losing the weight resulted in a job offer			0
she 's not sure if it was her new body or her newfound confidence , but she knows people treat her differently now that she 's slim			0
" they see you as maybe having something to offer , " she says			0
perhaps her favorite part of losing weight is borrowing her daughters ' clothes			1
before , she hated to go shopping to buy new clothes			0
now when she visits , she does n't even bother to pack -- instead preferring to raid their closets			0
@entity41 just turned 13 , and @entity13 is happy her youngest sister will get to experience @entity2 as the mom she remembers			1
" she 's very free - spirited and encouraging and happy , " @entity13 says of her mother			0
" and that was being covered up by all that extra weight she was carrying around			0
" follow @entity161 on @entity162 @ jdwilson2 or @entity164			0

@entity2 weighed more than 230 pounds at her heaviest
she went from a size 20 to a size 2/4 by exercising six days a week
