-- a day after @entity3 forces overran the @entity5 neighborhood of @entity5 , opposition groups said friday that government forces had executed 14 civilians there and the @entity8 said an aid convoy seeking to deliver food and medical care was turned back			1
" it is unacceptable that people who have been in need of emergency assistance for weeks have still not received any help , " said @entity13 president @entity12			0
" we are staying in @entity5 tonight in the hope of entering @entity5 in the very near future			1
in addition , many families have fled @entity5 , and we will help them as soon as we possibly can			1
" amid claims by opposition groups that @entity3 officials were keeping aid workers out of @entity5 to conceal atrocities , @entity25 @entity24 ban ki - moon cited reports of summary executions , arbitrary detentions and torture and called for an immediate end to the violence and for humanitarian aid agencies to be granted unfettered access			1
@entity3 's @entity25 ambassador , @entity39 , said his government has been the victim of " extremely virulent rhetoric " based on " hearsay " from the opposition			1
" we are not claiming that the situation in those regions is perfect ; we do not deny that there has been a deterioration in the quality of services provided by the state in those regions , but the primary reason for this is the armed attacks , " he said , alluding to repeated government assertions that foreign terrorists are behind the violence			0
at least 75 people died , including the 14 civilians reportedly executed in @entity5 and 16 others who died in @entity62 when a shell fired by @entity3 forces exploded in a crowd of demonstrators , according to the @entity67 of @entity3 , an opposition group			1
deaths were also reported in @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , according to the @entity67			0
@entity77 spokesman @entity76 decried what he called the " trigger happiness " of @entity3 president @entity81 's regime , saying that " the brutality being carried out in the city of @entity5 in the last 24 to 48 hours is disgraceful and horrific			1
" " the @entity86 remains determined to ensure that those responsible for the atrocities being committed in @entity3 are held accountable for their actions , and we 'll coordinate closely and assist those working to document these appalling crimes , " council president @entity84 said			1
a convoy of @entity8 trucks and @entity8 ambulances reached @entity5 friday after receiving authority from the @entity3 government to enter @entity5 on thursday , a spokesman for the @entity13			1
but after waiting for hours outside the @entity5 district , @entity13 officials said they were told they would not be allowed to enter			1
" we reiterate the appeal we made several days ago , for a daily 2 - hour halt in the fighting to allow humanitarian assistance , " @entity12 said			0
together with the reports of continuing violence in @entity3 , the refusal to allow aid trucks into @entity5 paints a " very , very alarming " picture , " said @entity106 , a spokesman for he @entity107			1
" it 's just going from bad to worse , " said @entity106			0
@entity116 prime minister @entity115 called the situation in @entity3 " absolutely appalling , " and demanded that humanitarian aid be allowed wherever it is needed			1
" above all , " he said , " what i think matters is building the evidence and the picture so we hold this criminal regime to account , and to make sure it is held to account for crimes that it is committing against its people			1
" he spoke to reporters outside a meeting of leaders of the @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity134			0
@entity136 president @entity135 announced friday that @entity136 would close its embassy in @entity138 and the @entity132 recognized the opposition @entity139 as the legitimate representative of @entity3 people			1
" the @entity86 remains determined to ensure that those responsible for the atrocities being committed in @entity3 are held accountable for their actions , and we 'll coordinate closely and assist those working to document these appalling crimes , " council president @entity84 said			1
the @entity132 issued a statement demanding @entity81 's regime bring an immediate end to " the massive violence and human rights abuses inflicted to the civilian population			0
" @entity155 , the former @entity25 secretary - general , who has been tapped by @entity156 to serve as joint special envoy with the @entity158 on @entity3 , was to travel next week to regional capitals , including @entity138			1
the @entity160 unanimously called on @entity81 to grant immediate access to its humanitarian chief , @entity162			0
@entity163 was denied access this week by the government , according to @entity156			0
but on friday afternoon , @entity39 said she would have been welcomed			1
" i personally sent information to the secretariat staff to say that the @entity3 government accepted the principle of mrs. @entity162 ' visit and we requested a date for the visit and that to be communicated via diplomatic channels			1
how can it be claimed now that @entity3 refused to welcome mrs. @entity162 and did not allow her to visit @entity3 ? " the statement by the @entity160 was signed by its 15 member nations , including @entity179 and @entity180 , a @entity182 - era ally and arms dealer to @entity3			2
those nations previously blocked a @entity186 resolution condemning the violence and calling for a transfer of power			0
@entity190 's ambassador to the @entity25 , @entity191 , turned up the heat on friday saying his country and other members of the @entity206 " are fully prepared to be at the forefront of any joint effort aimed at saving the @entity3 people and bolstering its ability to protect itself from authorities that have lost their legitimacy by shedding the blood of their own people			2
" he likened the lack of an international response to the attack on thursday in @entity5 to other failures to act to halt killing			2
" it is as if we were witnessing a new @entity214 , as if the international community learned nothing from the lessons of @entity218 , @entity219 or @entity220			0
" that provoked anger from @entity39			2
" to liken that to the massacres of @entity214 , @entity218 or @entity220 , this is a disrespectful , misleading statement when it is issued by an @entity228 voice in this international organization , " the @entity3 ambassador said			2
" this is a misleading statement that serves only @entity232 and the enemies of the @entity228			0
" also on thursday , a @entity235 resolution condemned @entity3 's " widespread and systematic violations of human rights " and called on the regime to permit aid groups in to distribute relief			1
despite pressure from the @entity25 , the @entity186 , the @entity132 and member nations of the @entity158 to end the violence , @entity81 has continued to push forward with the crackdown			0
the conflict erupted in march of 2011 , when @entity81 's @entity248 minority - dominated government launched a crackdown against a predominantly @entity251 anti-government protest movement that eventually devolved into an uprising with an armed resistance			0
@entity254 is an @entity248 , an offshoot of @entity256			0
the @entity25 estimates more than 7,500 people have died , while @entity3 opposition group @entity67 says more than 9,000 people have died during the conflict			2
the @entity3 government says more than 2,000 security personnel have been killed in the violence			2
@entity264 , citing local sources , said 700 people had died in @entity5 alone since the @entity3 military began its most recent campaign there in early february			1
@entity0 can not independently confirm reports of casualties because @entity3 has severely restricted the access of international journalists			2
much of the attention recently over the violence in @entity3 has focused on @entity5 , a neighborhood of five square miles that endured 26 consecutive days of shelling before rebel forces announced a " tactical retreat " on thursday			1
the @entity277 's retreat from @entity5 leaves civilians vulnerable			2
" there is nowhere to go , " said @entity116 journalist @entity279 , who was wounded in his stomach and leg and then smuggled to @entity282 in a six - day journey from @entity5			1
" the area is ringed by snipers so any attempt at leaving the neighborhood is met by active sniper fire			0
i think most people in @entity5 had to unfortunately accept their fate			2
" though he has reported before from war zones , @entity279 said he considers the situation in @entity5 to be unique			2
" this is a medieval siege and slaughter			0
i would say quite categorically that 's the most ferocious , vicious , and unnecessary that i 've seen and there are actually no military targets within @entity5			2
all of the intense shelling is directed at the civilian population			0
" @entity3 forces , backed by tanks , surrounded the neighborhoods of @entity306 and @entity307 , the @entity302 of @entity5 said			1
intense fighting was reported in the two @entity251 - dominated neighborhoods , and a video posted by an opposition activist purported to show smoke rising from @entity313 after a shelling attack			0
on friday , @entity3 authorities handed over the bodies of journalists @entity318 and @entity320 to the @entity321 and the @entity13 , a @entity8 spokesman said			0
@entity322 and @entity320 were killed last week when a makeshift media center in @entity5 came under attack by shelling			0
@entity136 journalist @entity325 was wounded in the attack			0
@entity325 and journalist @entity326 , who was trapped in @entity5 with her , returned friday to @entity136			1
the opposition group @entity328 said it helped @entity325 and @entity326 to escape			0
@entity0 's @entity329 , @entity330 , @entity331 , @entity332 , @entity333 and @entity334 contributed to this report .			0
