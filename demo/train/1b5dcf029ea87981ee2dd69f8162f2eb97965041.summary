openly gay youths will be allowed to join scouting , a historic decision the @entity3 says will keep it unclouded by " a single , divisive , and unresolved societal issue			1
" more than 60 % of the group 's 1,400 - member national council voted thursday at an annual meeting in @entity8 , @entity9 , for the change , which takes effect jan. 1			1
" no youth may be denied membership in the @entity3 on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone , " says the resolution			1
the @entity3 , however , will maintain its ban on gay adult leaders			1
" the resolution also reinforces that @entity24 is a youth program , and any sexual conduct , whether heterosexual or homosexual , by youth of @entity24 age is contrary to the virtues of @entity24 , " the 103 - year - old organization said in a statement after the vote			2
the @entity3 said there are no plans for further review of the issue			1
@entity3 president @entity34 said the vote came after " an extensive dialogue within the scouting family ( that ) was exhaustive and ... very respectful			1
" " no matter how you feel about this issue , kids are better off in scouting , " @entity34 told reporters			0
" our mission is to serve every kid			0
" reaction from interest groups to thursday 's vote was swift			1
the @entity48 said the @entity3 took a " historic step forward			1
" " unfortunately , the new policy does not go far enough , leaving adult @entity52 , scout leaders , and parents behind , " the group said			1
@entity56 and @entity57 lauded the @entity3 's " commitment to creating a more inclusive organization			1
" @entity60 , an @entity61 mother who was ousted as a den leader in april 2012 because she 's lesbian , called thursday 's vote " incredible			0
" opinion : @entity3 ' decision makes no sense " they 've never been raised to discriminate against anyone regardless of sex or color or anything , so they ca n't understand why people care so much , " she said of her children			1
" ... definitely , one day , i hope they look back and think that we 're part of something amazing			0
" @entity82 , in an interview with @entity81 affiliate @entity80 , said that the vote energized her for her next push -- to change @entity87 policy so that gays and lesbian adults , like herself , can serve as leaders			1
" when we used to exclude women from things , when we used to exclude black people from things , and that never has ever worked , but we continue to do it , " she said			2
" i 'm going to be around to make sure that that 's not the case			0
we 're definitely not going to go away			0
" conservative groups and some religious organizations argued against making any change in the membership policy , saying it would dilute the @entity87 message of morality and potentially destroy the organization			2
@entity106 , founder of @entity107 , which opposed the resolution , called the vote a " sad day for @entity24			0
" @entity106 claimed that @entity87 officials did n't foster a " robust discussion , " did n't provide " honest information " and " hid information from the delegates			0
" he claimed that scouting groups now have two options : to " segregate " gay scouts from heterosexual ones by putting them in separate tents , or " put homosexual boys with other boys and put them at risk			2
" " we would n't put boys and girls sleeping together			0
why ? because they 're attracted to each other , " @entity106 told reporters			0
the conservative @entity129 tweeted : " sadly , the @ boyscouts ' legacy of producing great leaders has become yet another casualty of moral compromise			2
" @entity3 conducted a survey on the issue the vote followed months of intense debate among interest groups and within the ranks of @entity24 itself			2
in february , the @entity3 ' national executive board postponed a vote on the issue and ordered a survey of its members			2
that survey showed an organization divided by age and , in some cases , by region			0
" while a majority of adults in the @entity24 community support the @entity3 's current policy of excluding open and avowed homosexuals , young parents and teens tend to oppose the policy , " the survey said			1
survey : should gay and straight boy scouts share a tent ? a @entity3 spokesman at the time called the issue " among the most complex and challenging issues facing the @entity3 and society today			1
" " @entity3 will not sacrifice its mission , or the youth served by the movement , by allowing the organization to be consumed by a single , divisive , and unresolved societal issue , " the group said after thursday 's decision			1
chief scout executive @entity176 said , " our goal through all of this was to put kids first ... it allows us to serve youth who want to be part of scouting			0
" a long time grappling with a polarizing issue the @entity3 for years has been at the center of the debate over gay rights			1
a recent @entity189 showed that 63 % of @entity190 said they would support allowing gay youths to join the @entity3			1
the vote comes more than a decade after the @entity193 ruled that the organization has the right to keep out gays but also at a time of declining participation in the organization			0
membership in @entity3 has declined nearly 20 % since 1999			2
about 2.7 million young people now participate nationwide			0
the @entity202 , after the vote , said it will continue to work with the @entity3			2
" sexual orientation has not previously been -- and is not now -- a disqualifying factor for boys who want to join @entity209 troops , " it said in a statement			1
it was too early to tell what impact the decision might have on scout troops , and whether some families may join other organizations			2
the impending vote did spur action by a new organization called @entity218			0
@entity219 , an official from that group , said applications will be accepted starting in august for youth members and group leaders			0
" christian churches and organizations will use this program to continue serving @entity229 by training young men to have good character through service to their communities , " @entity225 said thursday			0
" the profound need for a nationwide program like this has now been realized and the relevance of such a program will only become more important as time goes on			0
" @entity240 , the @entity3 's national commissioner , said there have been ongoing talks with churches and others opposed to the inclusion of gay scouts			1
that said , he echoed other @entity87 officials in saying they believe that thursday 's vote ultimately helps advance the cause			0
" we 're accepting youth , " @entity240 said , " and we 're excited about where we are			0

reaction to decision -- both *positive* and *negative* -- is swift
under rules , @entity3 will not exclude youths for sexual orientation
the scouts will maintain a ban on openly gay adult leaders
