@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is glad to be back in business months after january 's devastating earthquake in @entity1 shut down his large athletic complex in the heart of @entity0			1
although he was unharmed , his father nearly lost his life when cement blocks fell on his car , injuring and trapping him for hours			2
on this particular afternoon six months after the quake , customers worked out at @entity15 ' main gym , some hitting the weights , others at the @entity20 table , a welcome break from all that still plagues @entity1			1
still , just footsteps away , stands a tent city erected by 7,000 homeless @entity1 on the complex			1
" this is a 400 - meter track , and this is my soccer field ; it 's my land ; it 's part of the same property , " @entity15 told @entity2			2
he said that on the night after the quake , desperate @entity1 climbed over collapsed walls and found refuge on his land			1
at first , it was understandable , he said			0
but six months later , it 's clear he has become frustrated			1
" all the government officials we sent letters to , all the letters went unanswered , " @entity3 said			1
@entity1 prime minister @entity41 says the government is working on a resettlement plan , not only to solve land disputes , but also to provide housing for all displaced			1
but he says the government 's hands are tied until billions of pledged funds for @entity1 come through			1
" even if we do n't have the money , we should have a calendar , " says @entity41 , stressing the need for a disbursement calendar			0
and there 's also the matter of priority			0
" we have to understand that right now , the priority of the government is to protect the population from the next hurricane season , " @entity41 said			2
" most of our force is going in that direction			0
" meanwhile , tent camps , thought to be temporary living arrangements in the aftermath of the quake , have become permanent fixtures all over the capital			1
more than 1,300 have sprouted -- hot , muddy from the rains , lacking water and proper sanitation , and in some cases breeding grounds for turf wars			0
an estimated 1.5 million people are homeless and living in such conditions in @entity1			1
many are on private property and the crisis is pitting landowners against the desperate			2
at another tent camp pitched on private property , @entity81 washes clothes by hand in a plastic basin that sits on a dirt floor			2
she has lived in this camp since the night of the quake			0
her daughter , @entity90 , was born here just weeks later			0
recently , a judge showed up at the site , warning the homeless it was time to go and that the owner was fed up			1
they missed the deadline to leave , and still they are waiting without a place to go			0
at a nearby camp , another landowner successfully evicted a group of homeless			2
" it was 52 families , " said @entity105 , showing a lot that once housed quake victims who have now resettled in other camps			0
asked whether there will be a change six months from now , @entity112 humanitarian spokesman @entity111 was blunt			1
" it will take time to get 1.5 million people back into the kind of long - term living arrangements that they want and need , " she said			1
for @entity123 -- whose athletic complex once boasted tennis and basketball courts , a soccer field and other recreational areas that have now become squatting areas -- news that this will take even longer does not sit well			0
" there 's a barbershop			0
there 's a cyber cafe			0
there 's a hotel in one of the tents , where people pay to stay there for the night -- i swear to @entity141 , " he said			2
so far , @entity15 has found a way to make peace with the homeless on his land , waiting for a solution to come to salvage his business that 's taken a 50 percent hit since it became the site of a tent city			1
asked whether he can keep his business afloat , he replied , " @entity141 give the strength			0
@entity141 give me the strength			0
" @entity2 's @entity154 contributed to this report .			0
