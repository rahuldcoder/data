@entity0 -- @entity3 supporters were never that trusting of his son , @entity5			1
to ardent @entity3 legions who energized his bid for the presidency around his libertarian principles , @entity5 reflected a corrupt , business - as - usual political system -- one that asked people to compromise their beliefs in the quest for power			1
they saw @entity3 , a former @entity18 congressman , rising above that until this week when @entity5 , the @entity20 senator who is viewed as a potential presidential candidate in 2016 , blazed his own path toward their hearts and minds			1
he appealed to civil libertarians at their core by challenging the @entity29 nominee to head the @entity30 , and pushing the @entity32 administration to clarify -- not once , but twice -- its policy on targeting @entity35 in counter-terror operations with lethal force			0
he threw the faithful a healthy portion of red political meat with a 13 - hour filibuster over @entity42 , who was confirmed to the @entity30 post on thursday			1
@entity42 was president @entity32 's chief counter-terrorism adviser			0
@entity5 highlighted his dissatisfaction with the response of the administration to his question of whether it could use a drone to kill @entity35 on @entity35 soil			2
the issue resonates with both libertarians on the far right and liberals on the far left by challenging what they consider to be excessive government powers			0
in particular , @entity5 sought clarity that only a war enemy -- even if a @entity35 citizen -- could be targeted			2
his @entity60 marathon amounted to a libertarian clinic			0
he quoted libertarian thinkers , emphasized the infallibility of the @entity64 and elevated the drone discussion			0
" i think this definitely scored him some points , " said @entity67 , the former chair of the @entity68			0
" i was getting a lot of messages from people saying ' wow , @entity5 is stepping up			2
' people were really positive about it			0
" " you have to give credit where credit is due and when someone does something that is clearly fighting for the people 's liberty , then regardless of how you feel about that person , you have to take notice , " @entity76 , an ardent @entity5 supporter and musician for the campaign said			2
" @entity5 , these days , is the lone senator standing up against injustice			2
" during the 2012 campaign , @entity3 wielded great of influence among a small , but fervent , group of supporters			1
that passion turned into a fundraising operation that even establishment @entity98 candidates envied			0
when @entity3 withdrew from the @entity98 race , more establishment members of the party saw @entity5 as the inheritor of his father 's following			1
many in the @entity3 movement challenged that assumption			0
then @entity5 began to speak shortly before noon on wednesday			0
" i rise today to begin to filibuster @entity42 's nomination for the @entity30			0
i will speak until i can no longer speak			0
i will speak as long as it takes , " he said			0
blogs dedicated to the liberty movement , a nickname for the @entity3 , began to blow up with posts about the filibuster			1
radio shows dedicated to @entity3 scrapped their original programming and covered @entity5 live			1
and the hashtag # @entity119 , a tag that has long been used by libertarian supporters of @entity5 , began to trend worldwide			2
as the hours ticked by , @entity5 's image among @entity3 supporters began to change			1
even those who ardently opposed @entity5 during his father 's 2012 campaign for president began to soften			1
" i was skeptical of @entity5 from the beginning , " said @entity129 , a radio host and event organizer for the 2012 @entity3			1
" i appreciate what @entity5 did last night and i think it sent a very strong message			0
i have a much higher opinion of him than i did before			0
" the distrust of @entity5 stems from @entity60 votes and decisions he made during the 2012 campaign			2
in particular , @entity3 supporters have pointed to @entity5 's support of @entity143 and use of economic sanctions , which they see as overstepping the bounds of @entity35 power , as a few of the many reasons they were skeptical of the junior senator from @entity20			1
" the reason why @entity3 got such a following was because he was pillar with his principles , " @entity152 , a @entity153 - based @entity3 organizer said during the 2012 campaign			1
" i do n't see that in @entity5			0
" @entity159 deepened when @entity5 endorsed @entity160 for president last july			0
many @entity3 supporters were still angling for influence at the @entity164 and were appalled at the decision			1
they felt the senator betrayed his father , cementing long held skepticism			0
" @entity160 was the straw that broke the camel 's back , " said @entity169 , a @entity3 supporter who organized events for the presidential campaign			2
@entity169 , who supported @entity5 throughout @entity3 's presidential campaign , said that the @entity160 endorsement was incredibly difficult to defend			1
he said he took heat from outspoken @entity3 supporters			1
@entity169 said that @entity5 's filibuster provided some vindication			1
" what last night did for me was it affirmed everything that i had done even when it was hard for me to go out and defend @entity5 when he endorsed @entity160 , " @entity169 said			0
" last night was the shining jewel of what @entity5 is all about , to play politics where his father may have not			2
" hammered by conservatives on @entity189 to # @entity190 , a number of more establishment senators streamed into the @entity60 to relieve @entity5 of his speaking duties and support his cause			1
they included sen. @entity197 , who many see as the frontrunner for the 2016 @entity98 presidential nomination and someone who @entity3 supporters view as anointed by the establishment			1
senate minority leader @entity204 , the personification of " establishment " to many @entity5 supporters , also took part			1
to many @entity5 supporters , that sort of high - profile backing was icing on the cake			1
" everybody use to say there is no point in working with the @entity98 because of the mindset that there is no way that you can get @entity204 and @entity197 to stand on the ... floor like that , " @entity169 said			0
" last night changed things			0
" and although @entity5 has said he wo n't make a decision about a 2016 race until next year , his prolonged filibuster has warmed the mood among once doubtful libertarians			2
" i would n't mind if @entity5 was president , " said @entity129 , a voter who said he is n't sure he even support the idea of the presidency			2
" it would certainly be better than @entity197 or @entity160 or any of the other goons that the @entity98 will put up for the nomination			0

@entity5 's 13 - hour filibuster helped him gain respect from father 's 2012 supporters
@entity3 's supporters were distrustful of his son , who they see as the establishment
blogs and media that supported @entity3 voiced support for @entity5 during filibuster
some @entity3 supporters who were wary of @entity5 say they *'re* changing their mind
