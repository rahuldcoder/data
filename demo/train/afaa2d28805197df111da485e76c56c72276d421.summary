@entity0 , @entity1 -- over four decades in power in @entity1 , @entity4 portrayed himself as a revolutionary battling @entity6 colonialism , the leader of a united @entity8 and the " king of kings " of his oil - rich desert nation and beyond			1
he died a fugitive in his hometown , hunted down thursday by the forces that toppled his iron - fisted rule two months ago			0
his death was cheered by throngs of his countrymen in @entity0 , who let loose with celebratory gunfire and the honking of horns at the news			0
@entity4 's death puts an end to the career of the strongman who came to power in a bloodless coup against @entity29 in 1969			1
the 27 - year - old army captain soon adopted the rank of colonel , by which he was known for most of his career			0
he had a gathering of tribal leaders declare him " king of kings " of @entity8 in 2008 , but the title never quite caught on			0
he cut a flamboyant figure in comic - opera military uniforms or tribal robes that played up his @entity42 roots			0
he sported trademark sunglasses , surrounded himself with an eye - catching female security detail			0
on a 2009 visit to @entity47 , he invited 200 models to his ambassador 's house , paying each $ 75 to listen to lectures on @entity52 and giving each a copy of the @entity54			0
@entity55 , a former legal adviser to the @entity1 government , said @entity4 's mercurial public image was a calculated ploy , aimed at appearing foolish or mad			1
but as the " @entity64 " revolts erupted in neighboring @entity65 and @entity66 , toppling long - serving authoritarian leaders , @entity4 " was completely out of touch of the realities of the new world around him , " @entity55 said			1
upon assuming power , he fashioned himself as an @entity70 nationalist			0
the @entity71 tried to work with him at first but quickly found out that his brand of nationalism included opposition to the @entity75			1
by 1972 , he was urging muslims to fight @entity6 powers			0
he backed @entity71 black militant groups and supplied arms to @entity81 factions battling @entity82 , as well as to @entity84 fighters battling @entity86 rule over @entity87			2
his " @entity93 , " first published in 1975 , envisioned a radically simple system of " @entity89 " that would replace political structures from tribes to parliaments			0
but @entity94 , a former @entity86 ambassador to @entity1 , said the effect of @entity4 's rule was to leave himself as the nation 's sole authority			1
" he has destroyed every institution in the country , " @entity94 told @entity2			1
" there is no real civil society in @entity1			2
" @entity4 said he wanted to unite the @entity70 world , and even proclaimed a merger of @entity66 , @entity1 and @entity105 in 1972			1
that merger plan fell apart , as did a later attempt at a union with @entity65			0
@entity70 leaders largely shunned him , seeing him more as a " buffoon " and a " clown " than a potential regional leader , said @entity113 , a @entity1 expert at @entity114			2
that rejection from @entity70 and @entity8 leaders , combined with his growing anti-western sentiment , left him to turn to terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s , @entity113 said			0
in 1986 , @entity1 was implicated in the fatal bombing at a @entity121 nightclub that left one @entity71 service member dead , prompting @entity71 president @entity123 to dub the @entity1 leader the " mad dog of the @entity126			2
" @entity123 ordered the @entity71 to bomb @entity1 and imposed economic sanctions against the @entity8 country			1
two years later , @entity1 was implicated in the 1988 bombing of @entity130 , which killed 270 people when it exploded over @entity132 , @entity133			1
years later , @entity4 appeared to moderate and seek rapprochement with the @entity75			1
in 1999 , he turned over suspects in the @entity132 bombing , and in 2003 the country agreed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction			2
those moves paved the way for the lifting of economic sanctions , the restoration of diplomatic relations with @entity146 in 2006 and @entity1 's removal from the @entity71 list of state sponsors of terrorism the following year			2
in the years before the current rebellion started , @entity4 even hired a public relations firm to burnish his global image as a statesman and a reformer			2
starting in 2006 , the leader spent about $ 3 million a year to execute a public relations strategy that included paying think - tank analysts and former government officials to take a free trip to @entity1 for lectures , discussions and personal meetings with @entity4			1
then - @entity71 secretary of state @entity164 met with @entity4 in 2008 and " thought he was serious " about @entity1 's turnabout			1
" he said at one point it has taken too long , that the lessons of history had to be learned , " @entity167 later said			0
in 2009 , @entity4 became chairman of the @entity173 , aiming to turn the now - 54 - member organization into a group of " @entity8 united states			1
" he had been working to build his influence in the region for decades , building a gleaming mosque in @entity181 's capital , @entity182 , in the 1970s and another popular mosque in @entity184 , the capital of neighboring @entity185			0
@entity4 also poured money into @entity187 and @entity188 as well			2
he addressed the @entity189 for the first and only time in 2009			0
in his 96 - minute ramble , he denounced the @entity191 as a " terror council , " suggested the @entity194 swine - flu virus was a military tool and called for renewed investigations into the assassinations of @entity198 and the rev. @entity199 but critics called his plans for a united @entity8 impractical , and he lost his bid for a second term as @entity173 chairman in 2010			0
the bell began to toll for @entity4 in february after people around the @entity126 and @entity8 started challenging their leaders in the so - called @entity64 movement			1
@entity4 found himself a target following the ouster of @entity66 president @entity211 , whom the @entity1 leader had supported , as anti-government demonstrations began			1
the eastern city of @entity215 fell to rebel forces swiftly as @entity4 blamed outsiders and " armed gangs " for the violence			2
he told his people the @entity71 was giving young @entity1 " hallucination pills " to fuel the revolt			1
he vowed never to leave @entity1 and to " die as a martyr at the end			2
" but his reputation and his fate were largely sealed by his crackdown on protesters and attacks against rebels and civilians alike			0
the rebels were soon backed by @entity233 airstrikes , launched in march under a @entity191 resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians from reprisals			0
over the summer , revolutionary fighters edged closer to @entity0 , cutting off key supply routes for @entity4 's remaining forces			1
by august 21 , they had broken through into the capital ; two days later , they ransacked @entity4 's @entity244 compound			1
members of his family , including his wife and three grown children , soon decamped to @entity249			0
the " king of kings " remained behind , broadcasting occasional defiant messages by radio and television to his shrinking band of followers			0
" all along , he was telling them that he is in a safe place and that he is going to bring them back to power , " former aide @entity256 told @entity2			1
" for the past few months , that 's basically the message that he was sending			0
but , of course , in reality , he was hiding and running for his life			1
" @entity2 's @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269 contributed to this report .			0
