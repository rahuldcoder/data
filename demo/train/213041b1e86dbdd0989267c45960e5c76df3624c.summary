-- after age 60 , we are all likely passengers on the @entity3			0
these days it 's overcrowded with baby boomers and is predicted by 2050 to claim 115 million victims worldwide , including 13.5 million @entity7 ( up from 5.1 million today ) , bankrupting our health care system			1
that will happen , says a recent @entity11 report , unless we slow down this terrible disease			0
the good news is : most of us can			0
it 's true that pharmaceutical drugs have failed miserably to stop or reverse the disease			0
a cure is not on the immediate horizon			0
" maybe not for 100 years , or ever , " says dr. @entity20 , a prominent @entity21 's researcher at the @entity23 - funded @entity22 in @entity24			1
" the answer , " he says , as do thousands of other @entity21 's researchers , " is prevention , " the same strategy we use against other chronic diseases of aging , such as heart disease			1
the evidence that we can cut our risk of @entity21 's is compelling and mounting constantly			1
it is true that your vulnerability to @entity21 's and other dementias is definitely influenced by your genes			2
early onset @entity21 's , before age 60 , is caused by genetic mutations and is thus quite strongly inherited			2
but in late - onset @entity21 , which appears after age 60 and accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all cases , genes are not destiny ; they simply make us more susceptible			0
i have the major " susceptibility gene " known as @entity49 , that triples my risk of developing @entity21 's in late life			2
seventy - seven million other @entity7 ( 25 percent of the population ) also carry it			2
but @entity21 's is more of a personal and public health choice than most people realize , as shown by thousands of scientific papers on the subject			1
" a lot of @entity21 's is about lifestyle -- what you do and even who you are , your personality , " says prominent @entity21 's researcher @entity58 at @entity60 's @entity59			1
effective deterrents to @entity21 's , according to @entity58 : a higher education , staying mentally active , eating the right foods , exercising , muscle - building and being conscientious , easy - going and an extrovert			1
much research ties @entity21 's to the same lifestyle factors that cause heart attacks and strokes : high cholesterol , blood pressure , high blood sugar , insulin resistance , diabetes , obesity and physical inactivity			1
" taking care of your heart protects your brain , " says @entity82			0
he urges preventing @entity21 's by screening for and treating cardiovascular disease in middle age , years before signs of memory loss and dementia appear			1
two other striking ways to ward off @entity21 : stop smoking and avoid heavy drinking , especially binge drinking			0
smoking doubles your risk of @entity21 's , according to a recent @entity101 , @entity100 analysis			2
excessive alcohol brings on @entity21 's two to three years earlier , @entity103 scientists found			1
bottom line : most @entity21 's , like heart disease and cancer , is a slowly developing chronic disease of aging that takes a decade or more to produce memory loss and dementia			2
its progression is accelerated or slowed by diet , personality , lifestyle factors and other health conditions , such as treatable thyroid abnormalities and depression			0
thus , we all have many years in which to stall this disease and perhaps outlive its devastating symptoms			0
if we could delay the onset of @entity21 's by only five years , 1.6 million @entity7 now expected to get @entity21 's by 2015 , and 6 million by 2050 , would be spared , according to the @entity11 projections			1
estimated @entity127 savings would be $ 33 billion in 2020 and $ 283 billion by midcentury			0
we can each help save ourselves by intervening as early as possible before the disease seizes our brain and memory loss is irreversible			0
the older we get , the greater our risk			0
about half of all people over age 85 have @entity21 's			1
our best hope for defeating the looming global tragedy of @entity21 's , due to the rapid growth of an aging population , is to keep millions of people from boarding the @entity3 in the first place , or at least to show them how to jump off before the final destination , which offers no hope of a round - trip ticket			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 .			0

@entity148 says by 2050 13.5 million in @entity7 projected to have @entity21 's
she says research shows most @entity21 's can be held off a few years with lifestyle choices
education , eating right , exercise , being conscientious and easy - going can help , she says
@entity148 : delaying @entity21 's by 5 years would spare 6 million people by 2050
