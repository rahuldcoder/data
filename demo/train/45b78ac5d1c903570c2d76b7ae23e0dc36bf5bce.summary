-- it is unfortunate that @entity2 lied about @entity4 's labor practices on " @entity5 " by fabricating some harrowing details about the suffering of workers in @entity9 who make @entity10 and iphones			1
but this revelation should not divert attention away from the very real , pressing issue of labor abuses in @entity9			1
the public radio episode that aired @entity18 's falsified account helped set in motion a series of news reports and close scrutiny from the media , forcing @entity4 to acknowledge that conditions in its supplier factories can be improved and that workers should be treated better			1
now , because of @entity18 's lies , some people might dismiss the problem of @entity9 's labor abuses			1
@entity18 should not have lied , even if he were doing it to serve a bigger purpose			1
@entity18 's bigger point -- that workers in @entity9 are mistreated -- is true			1
analysis : @entity4 , @entity9 , @entity37 and the fabulist @entity40 abuse in @entity9 is hardly confined to @entity4 's supplier , @entity37			1
in some ways , the working conditions in foreign - invested factories such as @entity37 is better than that of domestic factories			1
compared with workers in large foreign - invested factories , workers in domestic factories often encounter delayed payment of wages , lack of safety measures and no health care			1
in an incident in 2003 , @entity9 premier @entity57 helped a migrant worker reclaim her overdue wage from her employer			2
to date , unpaid and delayed wages remain one of the most serious problems for migrant workers			0
outside of factories , workers such as miners or construction laborers fare even worse since they forgo written employment contracts and face substandard working conditions			0
in the event of injuries or wages withheld , they can not even file for legal protections			0
@entity9 has about 153 million migrant workers			2
according to a 2006 nationwide survey conducted by the government , 86 % of them work more than 8 hours every day and more than half of them can not receive their monthly wages on time			0
a study from an academic group last year shows that these conditions have not improved			0
of course , @entity9 workers have not suffered in silence			2
wage disputes are on the rise			0
so has the number of distraught workers who threaten to jump from the top of factory buildings or skyscrapers that they have just built			0
the plight of @entity9 workers is rooted in the skewed power relations between business and labor			1
in the 1980s and 1990s , local governments often colluded with businesses to keep down labor costs			2
in the past decade under president @entity106 , the government has sought to improve conditions for laborers			2
a labor contract law was enacted and overt discrimination against migrant workers was lifted			2
but they are not enough			0
migrant workers with little experience or few connections are in a very weak position in large cities			0
they often take whatever job is available just so that they can survive			0
businesses , on the other hand , incur little or no cost when they engage in unfair labor practice			0
many existing laws are only good on paper , and businesses face no severe penalty for flouting them			0
in a country where the government often considers a partial recovery of overdue wages as a success , it 's an upward battle for workers			0
despite a more tolerant attitude by the government toward labor protests in recent years , no channel exists to translate that into political energy for change			0
the @entity9 government outlaws independent unions so that workers can not organize or strike collectively			2
even if workers have the advantage of people power of their side , they are simply not on par with businesses in terms of political clout			0
in this context , the spotlight on @entity9 's labor problem raised by @entity18 and others is important			1
if multinational corporations follow high standards in their home countries , they should abide by similar rules abroad			0
and if more of them follow @entity4 's example in allowing independent groups to inspect their suppliers ' labor practice , it will go a long way to helping @entity9 workers			1
improving conditions in factories such as those owned by @entity37 will affect @entity9 's labor market as a whole and help workers gain bargaining power in dealing with domestic factories			1
we hope that with continued international attention on the plight of @entity9 workers , the government eventually will enact meaningful reform that will guarantee workers basic labor rights			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 and @entity189 .			1

@entity2 lied on " @entity5 " about @entity4 's labor practices in @entity9
@entity188 and @entity189 : @entity18 should *n't* have lied , but his bigger point is true
they say labor abuse in @entity9 is a serious , widespread problem
@entity199 : if foreign - invested *companies* improve , it will help the @entity9 labor market
