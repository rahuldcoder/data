-- @entity2 driver @entity1 summed up the dawn of a new @entity5 era in three juicy words -- weird , mind - blowing and challenging			1
after 12 days of intense and drama - filled preseason testing , the elite motor racing series is promising more of the same when the 2014 campaign opens with sunday 's @entity13 @entity12			1
@entity14 looks back at the lessons learned in testing -- and forward to what lies ahead as @entity5 embraces one of the biggest rule changes in the history of the sport			1
engine anxiety the introduction of new engine technology in 2014 was never going to be easy and so it proved in preseason testing as all three engine suppliers -- @entity27 , @entity2 and @entity28 -- had teething problems with their power units			1
turbo power is back in the form of 1.6 - liter @entity34 engines that are allied with two @entity35 , which have proved particularly temperamental during testing			0
@entity27 , which supplies engines to @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , is in the biggest trouble ahead of the @entity44 opener			2
its engine covered the least distance over the three preseason tests , ticking off 5,432 miles compared to 11,181 miles for @entity2 and the 6,346 miles covered by @entity28 , which powers just three teams			1
" some preparations are incomplete , " conceded @entity51 , who heads up the @entity54 company 's engine program			0
" @entity44 will be an anxious weekend			2
" just to make things even harder , a new green initiative means the cars must get to the end of the race with 100 kilos of fuel in the tank			2
the drivers will have to manage their car 's fuel consumption , and that 's a race craft some may have to learn			2
ugly cars some critics are calling 2014 's chunky cars the ugliest in the history of the sport , with the droopy " anteater nose " seen on the @entity74 and @entity41 cars ranked as a particular design horror			2
aesthetics aside , new rules on aerodynamic design have had teams puzzling about how to recover downforce -- which delivers speed and grip -- in different places			0
for example , last season many teams , and especially four - time champion @entity38 , eked out extra speed by using the exhaust gases to increase downforce at the rear of the car			1
those days are now over as the 2014 rule change means there is just a single exhaust exit from the side of the car -- and the good news for @entity5 fans is you will never hear the phrase " exhaust - blown diffuser " again			1
unreliable @entity38 @entity38 's achilles heel -- a lack of reliability -- sneaked back into the garage to haunt the @entity107 marque during preseason testing			2
on the penultimate day of the final @entity112 test , the problems with the car were so bad that four - time world champion @entity113 was n't able to complete a single lap. " reliability is still a big question mark , " said the @entity115 , who set the 18th fastest time on the final day in @entity112			1
" i 'm not calling us favorites -- for that we have n't done enough laps and the speed is not there compared to some other teams			0
" but it is still too early to write off @entity38			0
the last time the rules were changed in 2009 , the team was initially dogged by reliability issues -- but recovered to finish that year with the fastest car before going on to win the next four world titles			1
@entity1 has given the @entity38 his vote of confidence , calling @entity135 's 2014 design " stunning			0
" he also told reporters in @entity112 : " once they get the engine sorted ... as always , they 'll be very hard to beat			0
" quick silver could @entity1 be the title favorite for the 2014 world championship ? the early signs are looking good for the 2008 winner			1
the new @entity2 has shown it has both speed and endurance , completing the most laps over the three winter tests and consistently finishing at the top of the timesheets			1
but there have been reliability glitches , and @entity1 will want to forget his crash on day one of testing in @entity153			0
" the goal is to win the championship , and this year i 'm more pumped than ever , " said @entity1 , who is also rumored to have rekindled his romance with singer @entity155 over the winter break			0
but @entity2 teammate @entity159 , who won two races in 2013 , is taking a more cautious approach			2
" i certainly do n't see us as the top team , " the @entity115 said			0
" it may seem from the outside that we are in a slightly better position than our rivals but we wo n't know for sure until we get to @entity44			2
" best of the rest @entity169 is within a whisker of a return to its glory days after a very encouraging winter			0
the nine - time constructors ' champion set the fastest time at the final test thanks to @entity28 recruit @entity177 and also ran its car over several race distances			1
the team 's @entity181 driver @entity180 summed up the team 's excitement , saying on @entity185 : " think we are well prepared and made the most out of testing			2
ca n't wait for @entity44 to go racing ! " the big guns at @entity28 and @entity189 have had a relatively low - key buildup			1
both teams have gone the distance but are yet to show they also have the pace			0
@entity194 , who is paired with @entity195 in @entity28 's intriguing lineup of world champions , was amusingly mysterious about the @entity200 team 's chances			1
" i ca n't say if we will be at the front or behind someone else but we will definitely be up there at the top among the best , " the @entity201 said			0
there are no such guarantees for @entity39			0
the team skipped the first test in @entity153 and then saw drivers @entity211 and @entity213 set the slowest times of all 22 cars at @entity112 's final warmup			2
" there will be some long days and nights before the first race , " warned @entity39 head of trackside operations @entity219			0
new faces , old friends there are three rookie drivers joining the @entity227 in 2014			0
@entity229 's @entity228 , the 21 - year - old son of former @entity5 driver @entity230 , makes his debut with @entity189 , @entity233 @entity232 , 23 , lines up for @entity41 and @entity236 teen @entity235 , who has looked pretty handy so far , makes his bow with @entity40			1
he may not be a rookie , but @entity13 @entity240 will come under increased scrutiny in 2014 as he steps up from @entity40 to replace @entity242 as @entity113 's teammate at @entity38			1
fans of daredevil @entity246 driver @entity245 will be pleased to see him back in the fold with @entity41			0
the @entity5 community is continuing to support its most successful driver , @entity249			1
the seven - time world champion remains in hospital more than two months after he sustained a serious head injury in a skiing accident			1
organizers of the @entity255 recently announced they had renamed a corner of the @entity257 in honor of @entity249			0
the @entity107 @entity12 returns to the calendar in june , with a new @entity236 race due in october on the site of the @entity262 and @entity263 in @entity264			0
changes at the top the new season also brings some changes on the pit wall as @entity189 team principal @entity270 and @entity2 boss @entity271 were both victims of restructuring			1
former @entity39 team principal @entity274 arrived at @entity189 as racing director , following the return to power of ceo @entity278 , but there is still a senior position available at the eight - time constructors ' champion amid rumors that @entity284 could ultimately fill the gap			2
former @entity189 technical chief @entity286 now shares leadership responsibilities at @entity2 with @entity288			0
the sport 's chief executive @entity289 is also considering his future as he prepares to go on trial in @entity115 on charges of bribery			0
double or nothing despite criticism from teams and drivers , @entity289 's plan to award double points at the final race in @entity300 comes into force in 2014			1
the driver who takes the checkered flag on november 23 will win 50 points instead of 25			0
as well as double points , there is double jeopardy for the racers who , just like regular road users , will be slapped with penalty points on their @entity314 for bad driving -- 12 or more points and they will receive a one - race ban			0
the looming season will also see drivers use race numbers they have chosen for the rest of their @entity5 careers , with no. 1 reserved for @entity113 as the defending champion			1
into the unknown there are new drivers , new rules and temperamental new engines to get used to in the looming @entity5 season			1
but , as the saying goes , the more things change the more they stay the same			0
after three winter tests , @entity38 is on the back foot ; @entity2 and @entity169 may be favorites , but just who will win in @entity13 remains , as always , a race into the unknown .			1

@entity5 is entering a new era , with the opening race of the new season in @entity44
teams will line up on sunday with *uncertainty* over reliability of much - changed cars
world champion @entity113 faces *battle* after problematic series of tests
@entity2 is early favorite while @entity28 's new driver *partnership* is intriguing
