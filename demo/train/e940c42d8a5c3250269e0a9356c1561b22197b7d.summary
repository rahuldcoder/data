@entity0 @entity2 , the good news : @entity4 is in decline			1
2014 was a year of profound fear for communities living with -- and dying of -- the disease ; of health workers making the ultimate sacrifice , dying as they tried to save ; of apocalyptic forecasts as to the disease 's possible spread			2
with 8,810 dead , governments and aid agencies are now giving a timeline on when they might reach zero cases -- and they 're saying that could be in just a few months			2
that there are just a handful of cases left now in @entity0 is an incredible feat , but it has come at an equally incredible cost			1
and @entity4 is still critically dangerous			1
@entity27 has 65 confirmed cases , most in the west of the country around the capital and @entity32 where the disease spreads through overcrowded slums			1
the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) said last week that only half the cases in @entity0 and @entity37 came from known @entity4 contacts , which suggests that hidden cases are causing outbreaks			1
even as states of emergency and quarantine restrictions are lifted , there is a chorus of warnings against complacency			2
" a single new case is enough to reignite an outbreak , " says @entity48 , director of operations at @entity49 ( @entity49 )			2
" until everyone who has come into contact with @entity4 is identified , we can not rest easy			1
" and getting to zero ca n't be the end of it			0
@entity57 is calling for " a massive @entity58 , " saying the world " can not dither on recovery as it dithered over @entity4			1
" their plea comes as the @entity35 and other agencies engage in intense soul - searching : what went wrong ? why did it take so long to turn the corner on this disease ? could it happen again ? admitting to organizational shortcomings @entity70 , the @entity35 's director general , has asked the world 's wealthier nations to step up to the plate and support poor countries ' fragile health care systems			1
" well - functioning health systems are not a luxury , " she insists			2
" well - functioning health systems are the cushion that keeps sudden shocks from reverberating throughout the fabric that holds societies together , ripping them apart			2
" @entity0 , @entity27 and @entity37 have never had well - functioning health systems			1
they have always had some of the lowest ratio of healthcare workers to patients in the world			0
@entity0 had just one doctor for every 100,000 people in 2013 according to @entity35 figures			1
that works out at around 40 doctors for the whole country			0
@entity27 had two per 100,000 people			1
and there were n't even statistics for @entity37			1
then @entity4 destroyed what little healthcare they had , taking the lives of 488 health workers and leaving people too terrified to go through the doors of clinics they saw as harbourers of the disease			1
children were n't vaccinated against other critical diseases			0
centers distributing anti-retrovirals to the tens of thousands of people with @entity113 were closed			0
mothers gave birth at home			0
now trust in the region 's decimated health care system is beginning -- albeit painfully slowly -- to return			0
at a clinic in @entity122 , mothers fill a waiting room			0
they 've brought their babies in to be vaccinated -- there are no @entity127 immunization issues here			0
" we know that during the height of the epidemic immunization rates collapsed by some 70 % , " says @entity128 , @entity129 's country representative in @entity0			1
" now we 're trying to climb back up but it will take time			0
" placing preliminary healthcare within the community has also been a success			0
@entity137 and @entity138 ( @entity139 ) have been followed by @entity140 , or @entity141			0
the first were built in november in @entity27			1
now there are dozens in @entity27 and @entity0			1
their basic aim is to provide a place within the community where people can be isolated and provided with preliminary care -- pain relief and oral rehydration -- in an environment which is safe and humane			0
@entity152 , project director of the @entity153 at the @entity154 at @entity155 , has just spent three weeks assessing the impact of these cccs in @entity27			1
she thinks they 've played a huge role in restoring people 's faith in ebola - related care			2
" we saw some amazing innovation , " she explains			0
" where the family members can see their loved ones who have @entity4 , so they 're not taken behind a blue fence and never seen again			1
and even if the person does n't survive they saw the care that was provided , they saw the attempts to save the life			0
" the original idea behind the @entity141 was to train local volunteers in infection control procedures and have them man the units			0
but it turned out there were better options			0
" what the various partners found when they went into these communities was that there were people , there were nursing students , there were retired nurses , there were nurses who had left the profession but had the skills , the ability and the desire to help , " says @entity152			0
and for all the fear , the heartache and the stigma around the disease , there 's a clear sense of pride amongst those who are leading the charge against @entity4 at a community level			1
@entity204 is from @entity37 's @entity205			1
aged 18 years old , he survived @entity4 and now he goes from village to village spreading the word about the disease			1
" even elders will listen to me more than they would to you because i have been a victim of @entity4 , " he says , beaming with pride			2
@entity213 says she is " happy " to be working as a nurse at the @entity215 in @entity27			2
" my conscience -- if i saved one person here , i 'm thinking that i have saved the whole nation			0
that makes me feel good			0
" the @entity4 outbreak has helped create some hastily pulled together infrastructure which could form the building blocks of a more robust healthcare system in these three traumatised countries			2
and the disease leaves behind people galvanised for action as a result of their ordeal			0
now the question is how to use these resources to transition from an emergency response situation to more sustainable healthcare provision in the future .			0

who says fight against @entity4 has *shifted* from slowing transmission to ending epidemic
