a man slips behind someone else into a packed elementary school with an @entity4 - type weapon			2
he goes into the office and shoots at the ground , then darts between there and outside to fire at approaching police			2
so what do you do ? if you 're @entity12 , who works in the front office at @entity14 just outside @entity15 , you do n't run			0
you divulge your personal struggles to the gunman , you tell him you love him , you even proactively offer to walk outside with him to surrender so police wo n't shoot			2
and then the nightmare ends with the suspect , later identified as @entity21 , taken into custody and no one inside or outside the @entity25 school even hurt , despite the gunfire			1
" let me tell you something , babe , " @entity27 tells the dispatcher , @entity28 , at the end of the dramatic 911 call that recounts her minutes of valor and terror			1
" i 've never been so scared in all the days of my life			0
" this brief outburst of emotion , moments after police entered the school tuesday , was in stark contrast to her cool , calm demeanor as heard earlier on that 911 call			1
as a go - between , she relayed his demands that police refrain from using their radios and " stop all movement , " or else the suspect would shoot			1
" he does n't want the kids , he wants the police , so back off , " she said in the call			1
" what else , sir ? he said he do n't care if he die , he do n't have nothing to live for , and he said he 's not mentally stable			2
" by the end -- with police themselves having never directly talked to him -- @entity27 and the gunman were talking about where he would put his weapon , how he 'd empty his pockets and where he 'd lie down before authorities could get him			1
" it 's going to be all right , sweetie , " she tells @entity21 at one point in the call			1
" i just want you to know i love you , though , ok ? and i 'm proud of you			0
that 's a good thing that you 're just giving up and do n't worry about it			2
we all go through something in life			0
" @entity27 then let the gunman know that she 'd been down before herself , but she 'd picked herself up			1
" i thought the same thing , you know , i tried to commit suicide last year after my husband left me , " she said			0
" but look at me now			0
i 'm still working and everything is ok			0
" that day , for everyone at that school , everything did turn out ok			0
shots were fired , but no one got hurt			2
the gunman never made it to the classroom area , deciding instead to give up and lay down			0
this ending is thanks largely to @entity27 , said @entity28 , the woman who fielded her 911 call			1
echoing president @entity98 -- who called @entity27 on thursday to thank her -- and many others , @entity28 described @entity27 as a " true hero " for being courageous , calm and personable			1
" you did a great job , " @entity28 said , shortly after the two met in person for the first time thursday for an exclusive interview with @entity108 's @entity107			2
" you made my job a lot easier			0
" @entity27 , others ' thought it was a drill ' @entity27 had training in how to deal with such a scenario			1
school staff regularly train for dangerous situations involving trespassers and emergency protocol , school district spokesman @entity114 said			0
@entity27 and two other staff members -- a cafeteria manager and a media specialist -- were specifically trained in hostile situations			1
" the training is so often and extensive , they thought it was a drill " at first , said @entity114			0
while @entity27 worked to keep the gunman calm and spoke with him , she signaled a code to her two counterparts , who immediately triggered a phone tree to tell teachers to lock doors and send children to safety , @entity114 said			1
" her name , @entity12 , says everything about her , " said @entity135 , the school principal			0
she has always been that way , from the first time i met her			0
" he describes her as a strong leader whose authority everyone respects			2
the past eight years , @entity27 has been with the @entity146 school -- the past three at @entity147			1
and she almost was n't there tuesday			0
@entity27 was scheduled to be off that day , but because of a shift change , she ended up right where the school needed her to be			1
the school 's existing safety procedures will remain the same while the investigation takes place , @entity152 said			2
but he promised any needed changes will happen			0
" we will do everything humanly possible in our power to keep this next generation of learners safe			0
" counseling was made available to the kids , and the school understands that some children might not be ready to come back right away , he said			0
inside the suspect 's mind on wednesday night , @entity21 , 20 , was in a @entity146 jail awaiting a still undetermined initial court appearance			1
authorities are still hammering out exactly what charges he will face			0
@entity174 spokeswoman @entity173 has said they would include aggravated assault on a police officer , terroristic threats and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon			2
@entity182 , the lead detective on the case , added that false imprisonment and " several weapons charges " probably will be included as well			0
whenever the charges come down , @entity21 will waive his initial court appearance , said @entity188 , public defender for the @entity189			1
she said members of her office 's mental health division are handling his case and declined to make any further comment			1
this week 's incident is not @entity21 's first run - in with the law			1
he has a criminal history in @entity199 and neighboring @entity200 that , while not " lengthy , " does include violence , @entity182 said			0
specifically , @entity21 pleaded guilty in july to making " terroristic threats and acts " against his brother			1
@entity146 school shooting suspect was arrested in march @entity200 court records show that , in addition to three years of probation , he was ordered to attend anger management classes			2
but that county 's district attorney , @entity210 , said wednesday that there 's no indication that @entity21 completed them			1
as to any connection to @entity14 , why he might have gone into it armed , and what he planned to do once there , authorities have not outlined a motive or a detailed plan			0
being from @entity199 , @entity21 " possibly had been there ( at the school ) before speaking with some people in the administration , " @entity182 said			1
but " there 's no indication he had a grievance with the school			2
" before he entered the school , the suspect took a picture of himself with the assault rifle -- which he 'd taken " from the house of an acquaintance , " said @entity182 , who did not say whether the weapon was stolen			1
so did @entity21 go in intent on killing people ? @entity182 responded : " i believe there was something else , but i do n't want to go into detail			1
" some clues about his mindset are evident in the dramatic 911 call			1
with @entity27 acting as the intermediary on the call , the suspect said that " he should have just went to the mental hospital instead of doing this , because he 's not on his medication			1
" chief : it ' absolutely ' could have been ' another @entity253 ' while @entity27 seemingly kept her cool inside the school , a swarm of law enforcement was springing into action outside			1
police reacted " very , very quickly " -- including some officers who took up positions with long rifles -- " to engage the threat " and prepare for the worst , said @entity265 , the @entity199 police chief			2
" we can all make a reasonable assumption that he came there to do some harm , " he said , recalling last year 's school massacre in @entity267 that ended with 20 students , six adults and gunman @entity270 dead			0
" he entered a school , an elementary school with children in it ... to do one of two things : either to do harm to those children and / or any first responders			0
" thankfully , that did n't happen			0
in fact , the suspect never went beyond the school 's offices and never near its classrooms			2
while he fired some rounds at police -- and one officer shot back at him -- no one was hit outside either			0
and while there initially were fears that the suspect also had explosives , further tests indicated that was not the case : he came in with the rifle and a bag of ammunition , but no explosives			0
community members and leaders are offering praise for @entity27 and police , as well as gratitude that the story did not turn tragic			1
" was the potential there to have another @entity253 ? absolutely , " admits @entity265 , the police chief .			0

the woman who fielded @entity27 's 911 call describes her as a " true hero "
on a 911 call , @entity27 acts as a go - between between police , the suspect
she *quotes* him as saying he 'd wished he 'd have gone to a mental hospital instead
the ordeal ends with @entity21 's arrest and no one killed or hurt
