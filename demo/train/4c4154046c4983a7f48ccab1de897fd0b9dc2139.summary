@entity0 , @entity1 -- after rubbing shoulders with @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity4 celebrity gossip columnist @entity3 jetted off to " one of the dullest towns in @entity15 , " according to her latest column , to sniff out politically - inclined celebs in @entity0			1
" i would n't know [ @entity18 ] from an @entity20 salmon ! " columnist @entity3 says			1
what does @entity21 running mate @entity18 have in common with an @entity20 salmon ? and who will win november ? just a few of the five questions we put to the woman famous for knowing famous people over dinner at the @entity31			1
@entity2 : first things first : @entity35 , does the @entity34 convention compare to @entity11 ? @entity36 : it does n't			1
it ca n't compare , because @entity39 is very left - wing			2
and there were so many celebrities in @entity11			1
everywhere you looked , you fell over somebody who thought they were important			1
@entity2 : is that a good or bad thing ? @entity36 : it makes for more excitement			1
it makes for more media attention			2
@entity52 , you got @entity53 , you got @entity54			0
they 're all schlepping around thinking they 're saving the world , see , thinking they 're saving mankind			0
you do n't have that here			0
@entity2 : what do you hope to accomplish by attending this convention ? @entity36 : i would like to help @entity21 have a fine election			1
i would like to wave my flag			0
i 'm a patriotic red , white and blue flag - waving @entity65			0
if this is our system , then i want it to work			0
and i just want @entity21 to have an equal shot just like [ @entity72 ] @entity71 did			1
@entity2 : what are your thoughts on @entity21 's running mate , @entity18 ? @entity36 : i do n't know ! i do n't know this woman ! i mean i would n't know her from an @entity20 salmon			1
none of us knew her			0
it 's going to take six months to figure out what she does other than make mooseburgers ! i do not know this lady			2
i 'm sure she 's wonderful			2
i 'm not bright enough to have made a vice presidential pick			0
but it 's going to take us six months to know who she is			2
right now , i do n't like the fact that she mispronounces " i " - raq and " i " - ran			0
if she would say @entity96 and @entity97 , i would be happier			0
@entity2 : any thoughts on who will win in november ? @entity36 : of course , i 'm right here at the @entity101 , and i 'm picking up [ on ] what they 're saying , obviously			1
i sort of think that when it finally gets down to it , not everybody in @entity15 is going to press the lever for @entity71			1
i just do n't think he 's ready			2
i sort of think there will be upset			0
but i 'm picking up the vibes from the @entity34 convention .			0
