@entity0 -- in a congressional version of hot potato , the @entity2 on friday passed a short - term spending plan that would prevent a looming government shutdown and sent it to the @entity7 for a weekend showdown between @entity10 tea party conservatives and their more moderate party leaders			1
the 54 - 44 vote on strict party lines came after @entity14 pushed through an amendment to restore funding for @entity17 that @entity7 @entity10 had eliminated in their version of the spending measure , which would prevent the start of a government shutdown on tuesday			1
now @entity7 speaker @entity22 must decide whether to urge his divided @entity10 caucus to vote with @entity14 to pass the @entity2 plan , or yield again to a hardline conservative wing that demands making continued government funding contingent on undermining @entity17			1
@entity27 loses filibuster bid the @entity2 began its votes friday by easily overcoming a filibuster led by @entity10 sen. @entity27 of @entity31 against the spending plan			1
@entity27 waged a 21 - hour floor speech this week against @entity17 , but 25 more moderate @entity34 rejected his tactics in voting with @entity14 on friday to move ahead on the measure			2
all but two of the other @entity34 then joined @entity27 in opposing the @entity39 amendment to restore @entity17 funding , as well as in the vote for final approval			2
the other two republicans -- sens. @entity44 of @entity45 and @entity46 of @entity47 -- were out of town			0
@entity22 indicated thursday the @entity7 could revise the @entity2 's version and send that back , a move that @entity2 majority leader @entity52 warned would result in at least the start of a government shutdown because of the time it would take to reconsider the proposal			1
@entity27 said friday he expected his @entity10 colleagues in the @entity7 to continue the fight by revising the spending plan , which would mean " this issue is coming back to the @entity2			1
" in friday 's votes , @entity14 facing re-election next year in conservative - leaning states such as @entity63 of @entity64 , @entity65 of @entity66 , @entity67 of @entity68 and @entity69 of @entity70 all resisted @entity10 pressure to buck their party over the @entity17 funding			1
after the @entity2 vote on the spending plan , president @entity74 criticized republicans for using the threat of a government shutdown as leverage in trying to defund @entity17			1
" @entity81 are so concerned with appeasing the tea party that they have threatened a government shutdown or worse unless i gut or repeal the @entity17 , " @entity74 said , adding : " that 's not going to happen			1
" he noted new exchanges for private health insurance under the law will open next week as scheduled even if there is a government shutdown , calling it " a done deal			0
" exclusive : @entity95 disagrees with @entity10 tactics the revised spending measure approved by the @entity2 -- called a continuing resolution -- would fund the government through mid-november , more than six weeks into the new fiscal year that begins tuesday			1
@entity39 sen. @entity101 said the goal now was to work out a broader spending plan for the rest of fiscal 2014 that would ease the impact of forced cuts to the military and other government programs			2
@entity7 @entity10 split @entity10 leaders in both chambers do n't want a shutdown now over the spending issue , for political and negotiating reasons			1
they fear the optics of @entity10 being blamed for a shutdown , and also want to exert as much leverage as possible for the @entity10 's agenda at the upcoming deadline to raise the federal debt limit			2
however , @entity22 needs backing from the 40 or so tea party conservatives in the @entity7 in order to have a spending plan pass with full support from his @entity10 caucus			1
their opposition to the @entity2 version that had included funding for @entity17 would mean the measure could only pass the @entity7 with support from all @entity14 and some @entity10 , which would further weaken @entity22 's already shaky leadership of his caucus			1
the brinksmanship highlights the division within the @entity10 over how best to attack @entity74 's signature domestic policy achievement , which was pushed through @entity138 by majority democrats in 2010 and upheld by the @entity140 last year			2
@entity142 conservatives want to halt @entity17 now , just as full implementation of its individual health care exchanges begins in the new fiscal year starting tuesday			0
in the @entity2 , veteran @entity10 conservatives such as @entity147 of @entity31 oppose the @entity149 strategy of linking the @entity17 funding to a possible government shutdown			1
" there are some people across @entity161 that are so upset with @entity17 -- and i understand their frustration -- that they say we ought to shut down the federal government , " @entity147 said , adding that the @entity151 had determined the health care reforms would be funded even if there was government shutdown " because there are alternate sources of revenue that could be used to keep it going			0
" so i say to my friends who say we ought to shut down the government to get rid of @entity17 that it wo n't work , " he said			0
@entity14 slam @entity10 tactics @entity39 sen. @entity170 of @entity171 called on @entity81 to " be responsible and forget about kid 's games like picking up their marbles and going home or throwing a temper tantrum or shutting down the government because you ca n't get your way			1
" on thursday , @entity22 had to delay their plan to introduce a bill to raise the nation 's debt limit after conservatives complained the proposed package failed to include enough budget cuts and significant changes to entitlement programs			2
the @entity74 administration says the debt ceiling must be increased by october 17 to ensure the government can pay all its bills			2
@entity22 signals @entity10 focus now on debt ceiling @entity22 and his top lieutenants initially hoped to move ahead with their proposal to permit @entity0 to borrow more money to pay its bills as soon as friday			1
the initial proposal by @entity7 @entity10 leaders , which would raise the debt ceiling for a year , included a lengthy list of @entity10 priorities including a one year delay of @entity17 , provisions to roll back regulations on businesses , tax reforms , and approval of the @entity212 oil pipeline			1
however , conservatives wanted more			0
" it definitely has a lot of goodies in it , things that arguably would grow the economy and would arguably would generate more revenue , " @entity10 rep. @entity214 of @entity215 told reporters , adding he was undecided on whether to support it			0
" @entity0 has a spending problem and this debt ceiling bill does not address the problem			2
" another @entity10 , rep. @entity226 of @entity227 , told @entity1 that she was also undecided but wanted to see deeper budget cuts on the measure			0
" i came here to cut spending and to reduce the size of the federal government , so when those opportunities arise i want to take advantage of them , " @entity226 said			0
when asked thursday about the scope of cuts , @entity22 told reporters that " in this bill , we have spending cuts and we have issues that will help spur more economic growth			0
we think the balance is correct			0
" @entity74 said friday that the @entity10 strategy amounts to threatening to " burn the house down simply because you have n't gotten 100 % of your way			2
" " that 's not how our democracy is supposed to work , " he said , repeating his past insistence that he will not negotiate under threat of a @entity161 default because @entity138 failed to increase the debt ceiling			0
@entity7 spokesman @entity257 told reporters on thursday a one - year delay in implementing @entity17 's individual mandate for people to obtain health insurance would undermine a key provision of the program that prohibits the denial of coverage due to pre-existing conditions			0
" the fact is you have to make the system work , " @entity257 said , adding people with pre-existing conditions wo n't be denied insurance under @entity17 " because of the expansion of the number of people who will be covered and participate in these marketplaces provided by the @entity17 through the individual mandate			0
" some @entity7 @entity10 questioned the strategy of proceeding to the debt ceiling fight before @entity138 resolved the question on spending and the possible shutdown			1
they argued the @entity10 still had some leverage to force a change to @entity17 on that measure			0
@entity1 chief national correspondent @entity286 said thursday that focusing on the debt ceiling was where @entity81 " wanted to wage this fight all along			0
" " they did n't want to get bogged down in the government shutdown fight , but a conservative revolt within the @entity7 @entity10 ranks forced them to get there , " @entity286 said			2
analysts warn of severe economic impact from any doubt cast over whether the @entity161 would fail to meet its debt obligations			0
a similar bout of congressional brinksmanship over the debt ceiling in 2011 led to the first - ever downgrade of the @entity161 credit rating			0
@entity1 's @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 and @entity306 contributed to this report .			0
