-- bagpipes are n't a sound one readily associates with @entity3			2
yet along with the menacingly slow beat of a drum , they 're the soundtrack of one of the country 's more unusual historic tours			1
a small group , illuminated by gas lanterns , is standing at the foot of a medieval moat at the entrance to one of @entity18 's best - preserved medieval cities and a @entity19 -- the @entity20 in @entity21			1
a guide dressed as one of the @entity24 is leading the tour , dredging up some of the island 's more sinister history , including how @entity28 used fallen bodies from his own army to cross the moat during the @entity32			1
experiencing the ' new ' @entity3 perhaps even more surreal than this somewhat kitsch historical re-enactment is the fact that it was conceived by one of the island 's most exclusive resorts : @entity38 ( @entity21 ; +30 22440 35900 ; rooms from $ 213 ; @entity40 $ 203 per person )			1
this year , the property launched a series of unique offerings under the heading " @entity3			2
" other excursions include a fishing expedition on a caique ( a traditional wooden fishing boat ) , beauty treatments performed with natural @entity51 products ( yogurt , honey and lemon ) and wine tastings from small vineyards in the surrounding @entity58 islands			1
@entity59 , the hotel 's managing director , says the idea came to her during the six - year economic crisis that brought much of the country to its knees			1
" the whole of @entity3 , it was like a small war , " she tells @entity0			2
while many properties on the island reacted by pushing out all - inclusive packages -- essentially keeping tourists indoors and away from local businesses in dire need of cash -- @entity59 decided to take the opposite approach			1
she launched " @entity3 " to get guests out of the hotel , and to promote sites that , though deserving , had remained under the radar for far too long			2
" i wanted to show that there was more to @entity3 than that , and more to @entity3 than feta cheese , " she says			2
" the crisis forced us to change the way we were thinking , and to get creative			1
before , we could be a bit arrogant			0
now , we have to be the best			0
" nothing to lose @entity59 is n't alone			0
throughout @entity3 , the recession is changing tourist offerings , giving them a new slant			0
" the crisis is the best thing that happened to me , " says @entity92 , founder of @entity93 ( +30 6948 405 242 ; tours from $ 60 per person )			1
@entity92 worked in marketing for a multinational corporation before she was laid off in 2010			1
two years later , she launched her own tourism company			1
like @entity59 , she noticed that tour offerings in @entity102 had been stuck in a rut			0
" i looked around at what existed in @entity102 in terms of tourism and it was all very standard , very stereotypical , all ' ancient @entity102 ' , " she says			1
" there is so much more to @entity102 than just the ancient part			0
" it 's a very complicated city and you have to get under its skin to understand it and appreciate it			1
so that was the concept			0
" in addition to its quirky walking tours ( among the most popular are a graffiti tour and a guided walk through the " enchanted forests " outside the city ) , the company pairs visitors with @entity102 gourmets , who host four - course supper clubs in their apartments			1
she now hosts two tours a day , attracting up to 25 visitors at a time			1
if it were n't for @entity3 's economic slump , she says she might never have found the courage to start the venture			1
" it was the kick in the butt i needed			0
i could either go back to the corporate world , which does n't have a future in @entity3 any more , or i could do this			0
" so i just jumped in and did it , because there was nothing i could lose			0
" beyond the package vacation there are many regions in @entity3 that package tour operators miss , regions that are only recently starting to find their voice			0
the island of @entity151 is a case in point			1
sure , it 's home to @entity155 , a bronze - aged settlement that lays claim to being one of @entity18 's oldest cities			1
it also possesses a history of mineral extraction that would set any geologist 's heart aflutter and is where the @entity165 was uncovered			2
yet it has been largely overlooked by tour operators , low - cost airlines and visitors alike			0
" we 're not that kind of destination			0
we have small family - run hotels that focus on service and quality rather than volume , " says @entity173 , who runs boutique travel agency @entity174 to @entity151 ( +30 22870 41008 ; packages from $ 40 per person per day )			1
" we do n't have hotels where you can go in and sell , sell , sell			0
" that 's why tour operators do n't like us that much			2
@entity173 started his company in 2011 after leaving a lucrative position at an insurance company to return to his home island			1
" the majority said , ' are you crazy ? you 're leaving a very good , well - paying job for something like this ? ' " @entity173 recognized that @entity151 had a lot to offer travelers : ancient thermal baths , underwater caves , an old pirate lair , third - century catacombs decorated with @entity202 murals			1
he also recognized that no one was talking up the island 's assets , or making them accessible			1
" it 's easy to go online and get a cheap room			2
it 's not easy to get in - depth knowledge of a destination			2
" if someone contacts us , we can tell them where to go , or which way the wind is blowing that day			0
" @entity173 supplies more than weather updates			1
his specialty is archeology and geological tours , which highlight some of the island 's incredible scenery			1
he 's also teamed up with other vendors on the island to offer a range of sailing and hiking expeditions			1
he recently introduced cooking lessons that showcase the island 's local cheese and produce			1
" as a young boy , i 'd remember seeing the odd , small @entity235 group walking around the island , but that was it			2
now , we have something more organized , we 're reaching more markets , and we 're seeing progress , " he says			0
other tours other examples of off - the - beaten path experiences abound , many introduced by local companies launched in the last few years			2
