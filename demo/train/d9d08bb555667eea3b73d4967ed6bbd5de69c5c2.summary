@entity0 , @entity1 -- it has been a long and cold winter in @entity4			1
you might think an invitation to spend a weekend in @entity1 with more icy weather would be the last thing anyone would have wanted			1
not a bit of it			2
when the invitation came to attend the @entity14 deep in the @entity15 i jumped at the chance			0
@entity1 's pm @entity17 and @entity4 minister @entity18 , host the retreat and this year invited the prime ministers of @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , along with the president of @entity25 , the deputy pm of @entity27 and the @entity4 minister from @entity29			1
several more including a member of the @entity31 and ministers from @entity33 and @entity34 pulled out at the last moment			1
this is an eclectic group of countries : two hardline @entity39 members , ( @entity1 and @entity21 ) , a country about to join in july ( @entity22 ) , one in the middle of a bailout ( @entity29 ) and one on the outside wanting to join but so far spurned ( @entity27 )			1
read quest : @entity47 disastrous decision the idea was to avoid being bogged down in the crises du jour , this year , @entity47			2
rather , think @entity50 about the future of @entity4 while wearing slippers , wrapped up in blankets in a remote log cabin			0
it is a quixotic goal since the very future of @entity4 depends on its ability , or failure , to handle crises , such as @entity47 ; which frankly it has spectacularly failed to do			0
the reindeer at the welcome family photocall managed to poop all over the ground , which was quickly shovelled over with fresh white snow in time for the pictures ... like the euro crises , covered up but still smouldering underneath			0
looking at the reindeers antlers was imaging leaders impaled on the horns of euro - dilemmas			1
oh i could go on			0
read quest : @entity47 bailout is nothing more than usual @entity78 nonsense it was striking how strident these leaders were about what needs to be done			1
" austerity with growth , " said @entity1 's prime minister , in other words , just as his country has done			1
@entity1 incidentally has just had a tax - raising budget , cutting spending but still managing to lower corporation tax			1
it can be done , came the satisfied shrill from the north			0
" follow the rules , " said @entity21 's @entity92			2
she returned to the theme again and again			0
if countries had done what they were supposed to do , we would n't be in the mess we are			0
whatever sympathy there may be for the people of @entity47 froze like the lakes outside when they spoke of the @entity47 banking system			0
@entity104 such as " unique , " " unusual , " " unprecedented " were used when what they wanted to say was " out - of - control - @entity108 - money - laundering banking - industry			2
" oh yes , with @entity112 money ( you can always rely on the @entity1 to put the boot in , ever so politely , to @entity112 )			2
read quest : @entity116 economy to dominate @entity117 2013 the @entity1 pm rejected the idea he was a hardliner ( he is ) preferring to call himself a pragmatist			1
@entity1 is one of those countries , along with @entity124 , that has had enough of bailouts			2
@entity18 , its @entity4 minister , made clear the future for @entity4 rescues is bailing in with investors ' money not bailing out with @entity1 's taxpayer cash			1
attending the @entity133 retreat was fascinating			1
not because of the reindeer i ate ( it really is a delicious meat ) or because the snow this far north is , well , really white			0
but because i got to see leaders at their most honest : all the @entity139 had taken their own hard decisions , for instance @entity22 preparing for euro membership and terrified about @entity144 's chaotic economy on its doorstep ; @entity25 , dealing with multi-year recession ; @entity1 with its own @entity148 factions			1
so they have had enough			0
they want the 27 member countries to get on with it			0
concentrate on issues like digital single market , growth			0
the only problem , everyone says , is that change comes as quickly as a @entity133 thaw			2
just as with the reindeer poop , which as far as i know is still there , covered up , like the euro crises .			0

@entity1 's political leaders held an *informal* *summit* in @entity0 , @entity133 this weekend
policy - *makers* from @entity33 and @entity34 pulled out at the last minute
quest : retreat was an opportunity to see leaders " at their most honest "
