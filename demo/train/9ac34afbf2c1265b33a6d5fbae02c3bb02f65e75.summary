-- @entity1 was too angry to talk to the press after @entity5 's @entity4 exit , and @entity6 was feeling very much the same way after a shock defeat surely ended his side 's @entity10 title defense on saturday			1
@entity12 crashed 2 - 0 at @entity13 , which allowed @entity5 to march 15 points clear with just nine games to play following a functional 1 - 0 win over second - bottom @entity17			1
@entity6 's ire was raised not only by a controversial refereeing decision late in the match -- mirroring @entity1 's frustration after @entity23 's red card against @entity24 -- but also by his team 's capitulation against a side thrashed by struggling @entity28 last time out in the @entity30			1
@entity13 even had @entity31 sent off with half an hour to play , but the key moment came when @entity34 's handball inside the area was penalized with a freekick outside of it as @entity12 trailed 1 - 0 with four minutes left			1
" he is a bit angry , as you can imagine , " @entity6 's assistant @entity37 said after the match			1
" he is just taking stock of the situation and calming down			0
he does n't want to come out here and say anything that might get him in trouble			0
" @entity37 later told @entity12 's website : " from where i was down on the touchline i did n't know if it was inside or not , but we quickly had a message come through to us that it was inside -- having now seen it myself , it was well inside the box , but it 's not gone for us			1
" but even then we probably created enough decent chances to get something out of the game			0
" @entity13 also had an appeal for a penalty turned down when @entity34 fell , and @entity57 had an effort ruled out for offside			2
even so , goals from midfielder @entity61 and substitute @entity62 kept @entity64 ' team in sixth place , three points ahead of city rivals @entity67 with a game in hand as the club 's manager celebrated 11 years in charge			0
more importantly in terms of the @entity76 title race , it left @entity5 in pole position to claim a record - extending 20th @entity10 crown at the expense of their bitter rivals			2
@entity1 made eight changes following last weekend 's @entity30 draw with @entity83 , but it was two of the players who retained their places that made the difference against @entity89			0
center - back @entity90 charged upfield and directed the ball towards @entity93 , who teed the ball up and then saw his volley balloon over goalkeeper @entity96 after taking a big deflection			2
that 21st - minute effort -- @entity93 's 12th goal in the league this season and 16th overall -- was enough to see off a visiting team which had sacked manager @entity103 last monday			1
@entity90 has been called up into the @entity105 squad for the first time since 2011 , and @entity1 confirmed that the 34 - year - old would be available for this month 's @entity109 qualifiers against @entity110 and @entity111 despite earlier expressing fears about his fitness			0
@entity90 was omitted by @entity114 for @entity115 as the coach cited " footballing reasons " -- though it was widely reported that the @entity5 defender missed out due to the fallout from his younger brother @entity121 's racism case against @entity123 , who was selected for the tournament in @entity125 and @entity126			2
" it was n't a great performance but where we are now is not down to today , but the last six months , " @entity1 said			0
" the team has shown great consistency and played a lot of great football			0
our goal difference is big over @entity12 now -- 13 goals			2
" the problem i 've got is a lot of players are away on international duty and play two games			0
they come back and then we 've got a lunchtime game against @entity145 on saturday ( march 30 ) and then it 's lunchtime again against @entity83 on the monday			0
we have a squad to use it and that 's what we did today			0
" fifth - placed @entity150 bounced back from the club 's midweek @entity4 exit with a 2 - 0 win at @entity154			1
left - back @entity155 scored his first goal since leaving @entity158 side @entity157 on january 's transfer deadline day , and @entity160 forward @entity161 also netted as @entity163 's team moved to within two points of fourth - placed @entity83 -- who host @entity167 rivals @entity166 on sunday			1
seventh - placed @entity67 crashed 3 - 1 at @entity168 , who moved seven points clear of the relegation zone			1
@entity172 could have climbed above @entity175 ' former @entity174 champions , but drew 0 - 0 at midtable @entity176			1
@entity177 won for the second match in a row to establish a six - point buffer over the teams in the relegation zone , beating bottom club @entity183 3 - 2			2
in sunday 's other matches , third - placed @entity184 will look to bounce back from successive defeats against @entity67 and @entity187 in the @entity167 derby at home to @entity190			0
third - bottom @entity28 host @entity191 , while @entity145 will seek to halt a slide down the table at home to 14th - placed @entity195 .			1

@entity6 *snubs* media after @entity12 's 2 - 0 defeat at 10 - man @entity13
shock loss allows @entity5 to move 15 points clear with nine games to go
@entity6 was angry after controversial decision *denied* @entity12 a late penalty
@entity93 scores only goal as @entity5 beat second - bottom @entity17
