in a newly released audio message and written statement , purportedly from the official spokesman of @entity13 , the group called on @entity43 to swear allegiance to the caliphate , which means @entity101 state			1

but residents in the city nestled along the @entity126 , about 140 kilometers ( about 87 miles ) northwest of @entity10 , gave a different account sunday			2
" there are no @entity3 troops here , " one woman told @entity8 by telephone from @entity115			1
the only presence , at least in her neighborhood , is the " @entity101 state , " she said , referring to @entity13			2
the woman , who asked not to be identified over concerns for her safety , said she could hear the sounds of a fierce battle , in the form of shelling , being carried out by both sides			0

a man gives a tour of the city to show , he says , that there were no @entity3 security forces on the streets on saturday , the day @entity3 forces said they launched the offensive			1
in the video , the man can be heard repeatedly saying " june 28 , 2014 , " presumably to offer evidence of the date			0

a video the ministry released monday showed the jets , with wings unattached , being pulled toward hangars			0
" these jet fighters will contribute to increase the combat capability of the air force and the rest of the armed forces in eliminating terrorism , " the ministry said			0
the su - 25 has been in service for more than three decades and was part of the @entity3 air force under @entity119 's regime			2
the announcement follows a comment by @entity45 that recent militant advances might have been avoided if @entity3 had proper air power in the form of fighter jets that @entity3 has been trying to get from the @entity1			1
" i 'll be frank and say that we were deluded when we signed the contract " with the @entity1 , @entity45 told the @entity226 in the interview last week , which was released friday			2
@entity3 has now turned to @entity195 and @entity230 to buy fighter jets , he said			2
" @entity160 willing , within one week , this force will be effective and will destroy the terrorists ' dens , " he said			0
@entity1 officials were quick to reject @entity45 's complaints			0
@entity1 fighter jets have not been slow in coming , @entity18 said			0
the first two promised f - 16s " were n't expected to be delivered until the fall , which is still months away , " @entity18 said			0
" and we were in the process of working towards that delivery			0
" the advance of the @entity113 splinter group " could n't have been stemmed through the use of two particular fighter planes , " he said			0
@entity45 's statements about the need for air support came as @entity1 and @entity251 diplomats told @entity8 that the @entity1 is unlikely to undertake any military strikes against the @entity13 and its allied fighters before a new government is formed in @entity3			1
mass graves reported @entity256 has reported the discovery in @entity115 of two mass graves believed to contain the bodies of @entity3 soldiers , police and civilians killed by @entity13 and its militant allies			1

the few @entity60 villagers who remained in @entity283 and @entity284 told those who fled that at least some of the kidnapped @entity273 had been killed , the rights group said			0
however , they had not seen bodies and could not give more information			0
