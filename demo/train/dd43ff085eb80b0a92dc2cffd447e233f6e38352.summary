-- " do you want to hit this ? " a man asked president @entity2 in a bar in @entity4 tuesday night			1
the president laughed but did n't indulge			1
it was n't the only time @entity2 was offered weed on his night out			2
that 's apparently what happens in @entity13 , which recently legalized recreational marijuana			1
the man posted the exchange on @entity17 for the world to see			2
@entity2 has admitted to smoking pot as a young man			1
he was an active member of the " @entity21 " in high school , which perfected all sorts of techniques for getting high			0
the president has since spoken about those times in more serious settings , saying as recently as this year that he made " bad choices " without considering " the harm it could do			1
" earlier in the evening , the presidential motorcade passed a bearded man holding a sign : " @entity34 weed 4 @entity2			0
" a sign outside a marijuana dispensary offered the same thing			0
the motorcade did n't stop			0
and @entity2 waving off the offers did n't seem to ruin the fun			1
his boys ' night out with @entity13 gov. @entity43 at the bar the governor used to own consisted of , well , things that take place in bars			1
" did you see how many balls he still has on the table ? " the president joked after a game of pool			1
@entity43 had five , while the president sunk the @entity55			1
a patron offered to buy the president a beer			1
" it 's too late , man			1
i just got one , " @entity2 said			0
while @entity2 the bear was loose , the entire night was not all jovial			0
a woman stopped the president , telling him that her brother died in @entity65 four years ago			1
@entity2 gave @entity66 , from @entity67 , @entity68 , a challenge coin usually reserved for veterans , who collect them			0
her brother , @entity73 sgt. @entity72 , was killed in @entity65 in 2010			0
" i 'm so sorry , " he told @entity66 , hugging her			0
presidential meet - and - greets rarely veer so far off script			0
by the time @entity2 sat down at a pizza joint with people who had written him letters , the president had loosened his blue tie and rolled up his sleeves			1
a teacher , a couple who own a small business , a college student , and a furniture store worker sat @entity2 down at the head of a table crowded with plates and pizza trays			1
" where do you all want me ? " asked the president			2
" right at the head of the table			2
" " @entity96 , that 's so formal			2
" later , he walked down the streets of downtown @entity4 , giving fist bumps , shaking hands and slapping high fives			2
he refused a selfie and resisted holding a cute baby			0
but he did find himself shaking hands with a man in a horse mask			1
" one onlooker wore a large horse head , " the pool report on the visit said , " but it 's unclear what message he hoped to convey			1
" @entity2 also stopped to talk with a father and son			0
the boy said he was a skateboarder			0
" i see you got a little scab here , " the president told him			2
" you got scuffed up a little bit			0
if you 're 10 and you do n't have a scab you 're not having fun			0
" the president ended the night with a picture and a fist bump with a gorilla statue and was back at his hotel by 9 p.m. tuesday was just the first night of a three - day road trip			1
@entity2 is holding a fundraiser for sen. @entity132 wednesday and will give a speech focused on the economy to promote his policies to help workers			0
then he 'll head to @entity68 , which has been the center of a political sparring match between he and gov. @entity139 over the deluge of immigrant children crossing the border			2
what can the @entity68 possibly do to top one night in @entity4 ? immigration reform probably is n't going to do it			0
opinion : @entity2 has n't hit rock bottom yet			0

the president gets *multiple* offers of free pot
there 's brew and *billiards* with the @entity13 governor
he gets to fist bump with a gorilla
and there 's a *guy* wearing a horse head mask
