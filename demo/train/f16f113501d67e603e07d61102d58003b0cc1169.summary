jockey @entity24 made the most of his late call - up as replacement for @entity28 , who broke his ankle on wednesday , as the 46 - year - old captured his third @entity9 -- and first since 1994			1
" it was a different era when i was riding for @entity32 and i 'm just pleased to show i can still be effective , " @entity24 said			2
