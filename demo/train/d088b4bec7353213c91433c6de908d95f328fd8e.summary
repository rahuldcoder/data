@entity0 -- @entity3 , when an elected official has to make difficult choices , balancing ambition with practical concerns , it boils down to a personal decision			0
but when the official is a political rock star who might just be the first member of his community to become president , the whole decision - making process plays out in public			0
take the case of @entity15 , the @entity16 mayor who has now thrown political observers a curveball by accepting an offer from president @entity20 to join the @entity21 as secretary of housing and urban development			1
@entity15 has been talked about before as a potential 2016 candidate for vice president			1
the idea of his moving to @entity27 , if he 's confirmed at @entity25 , is sure to keep tongues wagging for the next couple years			1
it will also provide plenty of opportunity for unsolicited advice			0
it seems many people have an opinion on whether @entity15 has made a shrewd career move or derailed an otherwise promising political future			1
i 've known @entity15 for about 12 years , and he 's a friend			2
i want what 's best for him			0
i 'm just not sure this is it			0
why should others care about this choice ? well , for starters , because you ca n't begin to understand @entity44 in the 21st century without an appreciation for the footprint being left by 52 million @entity47 -- a demographic estimated to account for 25 % of the @entity44 population by 2040			2
two - thirds of that population is @entity52 or @entity52 - @entity44 , and @entity15 is the most prominent politician they have			1
if there was any doubt about that , it evaporated when @entity20 chose @entity15 to give the keynote address at the @entity59 and launched him as a national political figure			2
people should also care because , in the short term , @entity15 's selection could energize @entity47 voters in time for the midterm elections and help efforts by @entity67 to avoid losing more seats in the @entity69 or even to retain control of the @entity71			1
it certainly puts @entity73 -- who are already smarting from the beating they took from @entity47 voters in the 2012 election , and who have been trying to make amends -- in a tough spot			1
if they attack @entity15 during his confirmation hearing , they 'll inflame @entity81 who will then turn the @entity73 into a pinata during the midterms			1
finally , people should care because so much of our politics has become boring and predictable , and this surprise selection -- and @entity15 's willingness to accept it -- is neither of those things			2
on @entity1 's " @entity92 , " pundits speculated about why a big city mayor would come to @entity27 midway through the second term of an unpopular administration			0
the answer , they agreed , may have something to do with the assumption that it might be hard for a @entity67 presidential nominee to tap a mayor for a running - mate position coveted by governors and senators			1
the thinking is that , if nothing else , moving into the federal arena makes @entity15 more attractive to @entity107 or whoever the party 's nominee in 2016 turns out to be			1
the 39 - year - old would replace @entity112 , who would move over to take the helm at the @entity115			1
but why would @entity15 accept the nomination ? @entity25 is small potatoes			1
there are four major @entity21 posts : @entity120			0
on the prestige meter , @entity25 is much further down the list			2
along with the @entity124 , it is one of those outposts in the federal bureaucracy where the minorities almost always end up in charge			0
there is no barrier being broken ; another @entity16 mayor , @entity132 , in 1993 became the first @entity47 to be housing secretary			1
and @entity15 seems content in his hometown of @entity16 , a base from which he can fly around the country delivering high - paying speeches and where he 's finishing a memoir which had been due out next year and which may now be released even sooner			1
he has never struck me as someone who is desperate to go to @entity27			0
and yet , now @entity15 is ready to start packing			2
the more i think about it , the more i think i understand why he feels compelled to make this move at this point in his political career			0
for one thing , @entity15 knows the subject matter			2
big - city mayors deal with housing and urban development , along with economic renewal , on a regular basis			0
he 'll be comfortable at @entity25			2
and it does n't hurt that , if @entity15 needs guidance , he can turn to @entity132 , a friend and mentor who knows the department very well , since he ran it for four years during the @entity159 administration			1
for another , @entity15 's political options in @entity161 -- a dependably red state -- are limited			0
he could run for re-election as mayor next year , and serve out what would be his final term until 2017			0
then what ? he could enter the private sector , and make a comfortable living practicing law , giving speeches , and writing books			0
but his political career would be over , just like those of many @entity161 @entity67 before him			0
his decision to join the @entity21 is a wild card , but one that might just keep him in the game .			0

@entity16 mayor @entity15 *slated* to head @entity25 department
@entity182 says the move could better position him to be 2016 running mate
he says @entity67 could gain , and @entity73 could lose , points with @entity47 voters this year
@entity182 : @entity25 secretary could turn out to be a dead - end job
