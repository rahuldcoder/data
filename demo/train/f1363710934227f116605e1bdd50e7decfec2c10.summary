-- @entity2 's @entity1 has rejected a plea from @entity4 , the @entity5 pharmaceuticals group , to patent its cancer drug @entity7 , in a landmark ruling that health activists say will allow @entity2 's generics industry to keep making cheaper versions of newer medicines			1
the judgment will infuriate multinational pharmaceuticals companies , already frustrated at the way @entity2 's 2005 patent law -- which @entity17 had to adopt in order to join the @entity19 -- has been repeatedly interpreted to permit @entity2 generics companies to override their patents			1
the @entity7 case has been closely watched by both the global pharmaceuticals industry and activists for access to affordable drugs , who say it will set a precedent			0
for years , @entity2 did not recognise patents on drugs , which allowed @entity2 's generics drugs industry to flourish -- and become the prime supplier of affordable generic drugs to many developing countries			1
@entity2 's generics drug industry is valued at about $ 26bn			1
in a statement issued following the ruling , @entity4 called the decision " a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options "			1
@entity2 's 2005 patent law recognises patents on innovative drugs , but sets a higher - than - usual threshold for granting them , especially for updated versions of existing drugs			2
the @entity2 law states that if a drug company wants a patent on a modified version of an existing patented drug , it must show improved efficacy of the compound			0
@entity4 , which had sought a patent on @entity7 , had argued that the original compound it patented was too unstable for human use , and thus it should be granted a patent for the newer form of the drug			0
however , @entity2 's patent office ruled that it was not eligible for a patent as it was not a new drug , a decision upheld by the @entity1			2
@entity4 has threatened that if it lost the case , it would not introduce its newest generation of medicines to @entity2			1
the @entity5 company sells @entity7 for about rs120 , 000 ( $ 2,200 ) per patient per month			0
@entity2 companies sell generic versions of the cancer drug at a 15th of that cost , at @entity77 , 000 per patient per month			0
the company said that few @entity2 cancer patients have been purchasing @entity7 , and most of the medicine used in the country has been provided by the company through a donation programme			0
but in a previous hearing , @entity2 's @entity1 judges have described the donation programme as " a complicated scheme " , and suggested the company should reduce the prices			2

for years , @entity2 did not recognise patents on drugs , which allowed @entity2 's generics drugs industry to flourish
in a statement issued following the ruling , @entity4 called the decision " a setback for patients "
@entity4 has threatened that if it lost the case , it would not introduce its newest generation of medicines to @entity2
