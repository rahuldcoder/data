in what might be a first , a woman in @entity1 received a traffic ticket for wearing @entity4 while driving			1
@entity5 was pulled over for speeding on tuesday in @entity6 and given an additional citation for driving while wearing her @entity4			1
the officer considered the head - mounted display a monitor that was visible to the driver			0
shocked , @entity5 posted a copy of the ticket on @entity14			0
traffic laws vary state by state , but many now have broad distracted - driving laws or bans on certain monitors that could easily apply to @entity4			1
the @entity1 law cited in @entity5 's case is meant to prevent people from watching television while driving			0
@entity25 prohibits televisions and similar monitors from being turned on and facing the driver			1
there are exceptions for gps and mapping tools and screens that display camera feeds to help the driver navigate			1
if a device has a safety feature that limits its display to approved uses while driving , it can be allowed			0
" i think the law is broad enough to say it violates the law , " said @entity6 attorney @entity41 , also known as " mr. ticket			1
" @entity41 has been working in traffic law for 25 years and said this is the first case he 's heard of involving @entity4			2
@entity5 says her @entity4 was not turned on when she was pulled over , and that the officer said the screen was blocking her view			2
the @entity4 display is located slightly above the right eye , not directly in front of the eye			2
@entity55 does warn users about running afoul of traffic laws in its @entity58 : " most states have passed laws limiting the use of mobile devices while driving any motor vehicle , and most states post those rules on their department of motor vehicles websites			1
read up and follow the law ! " however , in another section on navigation , it says @entity4 can give turn - by - turn directions , " whether you 're on a bike , in a car , taking the subway , or going by foot			2
" glass fans defended the technology in comments on @entity5 's post , saying that a voice - activated screen close to the eye could actually be safer than trying to check a smartphone or other monitor while driving			0
" @entity4 is far safer than any other means of information delivery			2
it is out of your view and not distracting , " said @entity88 , who compared it to checking speed and other information on a car 's dashboard , which requires taking your eyes off of the road			0
the turn - by - turn directions on @entity4 can be turned on with a voice command			2
the display will show a map view , but for extra safety the screen can be turned off while driving so there 's only voice navigation			0
a @entity4 spokesperson did n't address the ticket directly but emphasized responsible @entity4 usage , saying , " as we make clear in our help center , @entity111 should always use @entity4 responsibly and put their safety and the safety of others first			1
more broadly , @entity4 is built to connect you more with the world around you , not distract you from it			2
" @entity5 could take the case to court and try to get the @entity4 portion of the ticket dismissed			1
" how can this officer prove that this display was being activated or was actually on at the time and what kind of signal she 's getting ? " said @entity41			0
state laws are always adapting to new technology , and @entity4 is still a somewhat rare sighting			1
the device is only available as part of a beta program and is not yet sold commercially			0
according to @entity41 , new technology is a tempting target for law enforcement looking for new ways to bring in money			0
" there 's a wealth of revenue to be generated from technology			0
the traffic law enforcement is coming and saying wow , we 've got this new incredible device and we want our piece too , " said @entity41			0
with a mandatory minimum fine in @entity1 is $ 162 , this is just the beginning of more tickets for @entity4 wearers according to @entity41			0
law enforcement is increasingly enforcing distracted driving laws			1
during the month of april , there were more that 57,000 distracted driving tickets issued in @entity1 as part of @entity155 , according to the @entity156 .			1
