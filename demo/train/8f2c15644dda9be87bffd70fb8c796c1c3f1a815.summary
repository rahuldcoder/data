could be sold to pay down the city 's debts prompted a @entity11 state senator to propose legislation to protect the masterpieces			0
under the bill presented wednesday by sen. @entity15 , any art museum in the state must adhere to a code of ethics set forth by the @entity20 , which prohibits the sale of pieces unless the money is directed to improving the museum 's collection			1
the @entity5 has a similar policy with the city , but the government 's emergency manager has the power to cancel or modify it			1
the bill came about after @entity33 emergency manager @entity32 asked the @entity5 for an inventory list so that its 60,000 pieces could be appraised			1
the move sparked alarm among residents and museum administrators that the @entity5 's collection would be sold to settle the city 's massive $ 15.8 billion debt			1
" they basically let us know that the collection was not off the table , " said museum director @entity43			2
gov. @entity48 in march declared a financial emergency exists in @entity33 and announced the appointment of @entity32 to get the city back on solid footing			1
although @entity33 owns the art displayed in the @entity5 , @entity15 's bill would provide an extra layer of protection , so that if the city were to file for bankruptcy , none of its art could be sold to satisfy creditors			1
" we 're talking about cultural influence for the city of @entity33			2
it 's a part of the community and part of what makes @entity33 , @entity33 , " said @entity15			1
" it should n't be sold for monetary use			0
" @entity69 , a spokesman for @entity32 , told @entity0 that any concern for the art being sold is premature and that the request for an inventory list is simply a precaution			1
" there is no plan on the table to sell any asset of the city			0
the emergency manager continues to look at all options that will help solve the financial crisis the city faces , " @entity69 wrote in an e-mail			1
@entity69 conceded that while the city has not made any plans to sell assets , " it is possible that the city 's creditors could demand the city use its assets to settle its debts			0
" @entity43 maintains that @entity5 's collection is among the top six in the @entity93			2
while he could not specify a value , @entity43 said it would likely be in the billions of dollars			0
to sell off its pieces would mean dismantling a collection that has set precedents in the @entity100 , he contends			0
" it would be a tragic irony -- the first @entity100 museum to acquire a @entity1 in 1922 and then 90 years later , we sell it ? it 's terrible			2
" the news that the @entity5 's collection may face dismantling prompted response from other museum directors across the country , including @entity111 , director and ceo of the @entity113 in @entity114			1
even in the darkest days of @entity114 's economic woes , the " cultural treasures closely identified with [ @entity114 ] ... were never considered an asset that might be cashed in during a crunch , " @entity111 said in a statement			0
" i am sure that many museum directors around the country would join me in condemning the @entity33 emergency manager 's consideration			1
art for the public is not interim , fungible , or liquid , " @entity111 said			0
@entity128 president @entity127 is flatly against any such move , arguing that selling a masterpiece to pay bills does not address the city 's long - term needs			0
" if we sell art , it 's a one - time fix			2
we sell that @entity1 for $ 30 million , it 's a one - time fix			0
we did n't fix the structural problem , " said @entity127			0
@entity140 , a bankruptcy law professor at @entity141 in @entity33 , said she believes @entity32 is just doing his job and that it would be irresponsible for him not to consider what assets @entity33 has and what they are worth			2
" i do n't think anyone argues that @entity33 does not have the legal authority to sell something that @entity33 owns			2
it 's a question of whether @entity33 will -- and if @entity33 should , " said @entity140			1
gov. @entity48 has been working with @entity32 to try to ward off the city 's bankruptcy and the sale of the @entity5 's art. however , @entity48 admitted that he is not legally empowered to declare the collection hands - off			1
@entity43 said he will do anything in his power to protect the art from any kind of depletion			0
we will do everything we can to defend the integrity of this collection , " he said			0
the @entity5 was founded in 1885 and houses more than 100 galleries , a lecture and recital hall , an art reference library , and a state - of - the - art conservation laboratory , according to the museum 's website			1
@entity0 's @entity174 and @entity175 contributed to this report .			0
