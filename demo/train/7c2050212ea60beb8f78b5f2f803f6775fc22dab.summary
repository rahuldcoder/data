@entity1 's " @entity2 " venture is being rightly attacked for all the wrong reasons			1
she 's been drubbed for being too privileged and too powerful			2
what could a @entity5 mba who hopped from the @entity7 to @entity8 to @entity10 's @entity9 know about the lives of " real " women ? so much of the flap -- pro and con -- over @entity1 's attempt to jump - start a women 's revolution has less to do with the attempt than with resentment over her class status			1
her antagonists ca n't get two sentences into their critique without invoking her net worth and the square footage of her house ( $ 500 million and 9,000 , respectively )			0
and her proponents ca n't get two sentences into their defense without telling us how marvelous she was at that @entity33 at that five - star restaurant or that world power brokers ' summit that they had the good fortune to attend			0
economic envy is the skunk at @entity1 's book release party			1
we hate her for being so anointed , or we love her because we were deemed anointed enough to rub shoulders with her at some post-ted - talk party -- " we " being the comfortable middle - to - upper class women fueling this media debate			1
either way , what 's been missed is a real opportunity that @entity1 's proposal unintentionally spotlights : the opportunity to talk honestly about feminism and class			1
the unmentionable issue of class @entity56 are notoriously averse to discussing class			1
we want to believe the prime barrier to socioeconomic advancement is ourselves			0
@entity1 believes that , too			1
" we can reignite the revolution by internalizing the revolution , " she writes in " @entity2 : women , work , and the @entity64 to lead			1
" all we need to do is " lean in " to our ambitions , and up , up and away we go			0
the handpicked positive stories posted on the lean in website all attest to the same ethos : " you are the boss of you , " writes @entity73 , " @entity75 , @entity76 " or , as @entity74 , " actress & @entity79 , " puts it : " just jump ! " what we need to do , @entity1 tells us in her book , is jettison our fears : " fear of overreaching			1
... and the holy trinity of fear : the fear of being a bad mother / wife / daughter			0
" in this feminist - sounding riff on " the only thing we have to fear is fear itself , " the only fear not raised is the one @entity93 was addressing : economic			0
it 's remarkable oversight in the wake of the worst economic crisis since the @entity100			2
but @entity1 is n't alone in her silence			2
mainstream feminist debate , for all the lip service paid to the " intersectionality " of race , class and gender , has also left economic divisions on the cutting - room floor			2
it 's more marketable to talk about sex or pop culture			2
the recoil from class issues came early , when @entity56 feminism began retreating from its examination of root causes			1
in a 1972 article in the feminist newspaper , @entity121 , @entity118 observed : " early in the women 's liberation movement , i saw class as an issue that men in the @entity126 used to put down feminism			1
later it became an issue that many women said we had to discuss , " but never seriously did			0
and yet , we wo n't ever productively confront women 's secondary status without confronting class			2
our economic framework is founded on women 's subjugation			2
the power structure that @entity1 wants to feminize was built to cement the power of ( some ) men , and on the backs of ( most ) women , who would not only stay out of the power suites but would make all the power plays possible by assuming every backstage duty , from minding the kids to handling the least glamorous and lowest - paid work			2
it 's in capitalism 's dna , and no cosmetic paste - ons at the top are going to change the dynamic without significant change on the bottom			0
@entity156 , whose sane voice on so many feminist questions deserves more notice , limned that connection years ago in her essay , " class and @entity163			0
" " class distinctions are an outgrowth of male domination , " she wrote , " a political mechanism for maintaining not only capitalism but also patriarchy and white supremacy			0
" you ca n't change the world for women by simply inserting female faces at the top of an unchanged system of social and economic power			0
" you ca n't , " to quote @entity156 again , " just add women and stir			0
" could @entity1 's book have launched such a necessary discussion ? well , actually , yes , if you skip the many pages devoted to variations on her exhortation to " have the ambition to lean in to your career and run the world , " and linger instead on one sentence that should be at the forefront of such a conversation : " the number of women supporting families on their own is increasing quickly ; between 1973 and 2006 , the proportion of families headed by a single mother grew from one in 10 to one in five			1
" breadwinners and barely staying afloat since 2000 , as many households depend on a single mother as the breadwinner as depend on a traditional male breadwinner			0
one fourth of mothers are single , and at least half of children will spend some time in a single - mother home			2
in short , single mothers are now a huge demographic and a potential force for change			1
and they 're a subjugated majority			0
most single mothers operate under extreme social and economic impediments -- triple the poverty rate of the rest of the population , the highest rate of low - wage employment , the worst wage gap , the lowest net worth , the highest risk of bankruptcy -- that add up to a massive inequality in @entity56 society			1
and this is n't because of a lack of lean - in self - confidence			0
the @entity56 provides the worst support structure for single parents of any economically comparable nation , a recent major study by @entity234 found			1
and it 's only getting worse , as politicians aim to slash welfare programs , enforcement of child support , child tax credits and anything else they can think to deny single mothers , as they blame them for all that 's wrong with society			1
nor is their plight because of a lack of lean - in commitment			0
the study found that @entity56 single mothers work more hours than single mothers in any developed nation			1
and many of them work for subsistence wages for the same companies that have signed up to sponsor @entity1 's lean in campaign for executive equality			1
@entity260 , a lean in " partner , " is facing sex discrimination claims from 2,000 female employees in 48 states			0
@entity1 's book mentions single mothers in passing			1
but what if she were to champion them ? what if the lean in community or any group of feminist - minded women were to organize around the cause of single motherhood instead of the cause of their own self - congratulation ? it would involve , first of all , a change in @entity1 's rules			1
testimonials on her lean in website must be inspirational , not troubling : " share a positive ending , " its story guidelines instruct			0
the flip side of the view that women can do anything if they " just jump " is the assumption that anyone who does n't should remain invisible			0
that message is the precise opposite of feminism			0
consider instead the benefits of a campaign that bore down on the causes behind the negative endings that mar so many single mothers ' lives			1
it would not only be confronting a problem that affects huge numbers of women , it would be mounting a significant challenge to a system that will otherwise continue to stand between women and full emancipation			0
because what does a single mother signify ? she is an adult woman with responsibilities who is not supported by a man			0
symbolically , she stands for the possibility of women to truly remake the patriarchal structure			0
that would require a movement built not around corporate bromides , but a collective grassroots effort to demand the fundamental social change necessary to grant independent mothers a genuine independence			2
single mothers can only be insulted by the advice to " lean in " -- they could n't lean out if they wanted			1
and any brand of feminism that leaves them out is a faux liberation			2
liberating single mothers requires more than showing other women of privilege how they can be queen of the system			1
it means following the advice of @entity156 , and changing -- even destroying -- the system that the lean in women are so happy and eager to run .			0

@entity342 : @entity1 's *detractors* and supporters focus on her class
" @entity2 " movement is missing the chance to talk about feminism and class
@entity342 : @entity56 single mothers have massive *disadvantages* and no support systems
feminism that leaves out single mothers is a false campaign that misses mark , she says
