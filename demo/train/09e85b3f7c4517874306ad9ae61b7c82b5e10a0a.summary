-- last week , i joined the board of a new organization to oppose marijuana legalization : smart approaches to @entity6			1
the group is headed by former @entity9 rep. @entity8 and includes @entity10 , a veteran of the @entity11 under president @entity12			2
the new group rejects the " war on drugs " model			2
it agrees that we do n't want to lock people up for casual marijuana use -- or even stigmatize them with an arrest record			1
but what we do want to do is send a clear message : marijuana use is a bad choice			1
there are many excellent reasons to avoid marijuana			1
marijuana use damages brain development in young people			1
heavy users become socially isolated and perform worse in school and at work			2
marijuana smoke harms the lungs			1
a growing body of evidence suggests that marijuana can trigger psychotic symptoms that otherwise would have remained latent			1
it 's possible to imagine a marijuana rule that tries to respond precisely to such risk factors as happen to be known by the current state of science			1
such a rule might say : " you should n't use marijuana until you are over 25 , or after your brain has ceased to develop , whichever comes first			1
you should n't use marijuana if you are predisposed to certain mental illnesses ( most of which we ca n't yet diagnose in advance )			1
be aware that about one - sixth of users will become chronically dependent on marijuana , and as a result will suffer a serious degradation of life outcomes			1
as yet , we have no sure idea at what dosage marijuana will impair your ability to drive safely , or how long the impairment will last			1
be as careful as you can , within the limits of our present knowledge ! " yet as a parent of three , two exiting adolescence and one entering , i 've found that the argument that makes the biggest impression is : " marijuana is illegal			1
" i think many other parents have found the same thing			2
when we write social rules , we always need to consider : who are we writing rules for ? some people can cope with complexity			1
some people will snap back from an early mistake			1
" just say no " is an easy rule to follow			2
" it depends on individual risk factors , many of them unknowable in advance " -- that rule is not so easy			2
@entity92 : @entity93 a trillion - dollar failure over the past three decades , and in area after area of social life , @entity9 have replaced simple rules that anybody can follow with complex rules that baffle large numbers of people			1
consider , for example , the home mortgage			2
once the mortgage was a very simple product			1
put 20 % down , then sign up for a fixed schedule of payments over the next 30 years			2
in the space of a single generation , these 30 - year fixed - rate amortizing mortgages turned what had been a nation of renters into a nation of homeowners			2
for more sophisticated buyers , however , the standard mortgage was a big nuisance			0
for them , bankers developed more flexible products : no money down , no documentation , interest - only , adjustable rate			0
these products met genuine needs			0
but as they diffused down - market , they became traps for people who did not understand the risks they were accepting			1
consider how we finance higher education			0
once , state governments subsidized their universities to offer a low tuition fee to all comers			0
fee increases at private universities were constrained by the lower fees at the public institutions : @entity143 can raise its price only so high above the @entity145			0
the universities soon realized , however , that by setting their tuition fees low , they were forgoing revenues that might be collected from the most affluent students			0
universities rapidly raised their tuition fees , then offered discounts and aid to students in need			0
@entity10 : legalize pot ? no , reform laws but while anybody could understand a $ 500 per semester tuition bill , the new system of rebates confuses the very people who most need help			1
a few days before @entity166 , @entity164 of the @entity165 reported a depressing example of the toll modern financial aid exacts upon students from less sophisticated backgrounds			0
he told the story of three bright girls from poor families who had recently tried -- and failed -- to gain college degrees			0
one of them was admitted to @entity176 , a prestigious school with a full - ticket price of $ 50,000 , but one that grants very generous financial aid -- if the student can figure out how to make the financial aid work for her			0
the trouble was that students who most need aid are often precisely those who have nobody around them who has ever successfully navigated a complicated bureaucratic institution like a university financial aid office			0
" though @entity176 sent weekly e-mails -- 17 of them , along with an invitation to a program for minority students -- they went to a school account she had not learned to check , " @entity164 wrote			0
" @entity194 reported that her mother made $ 35,000 a year and paid about half of that in rent			0
with her housing costs so high , @entity176 assumed the family had extra money and assigned ... an income of $ 51,000			0
... ( @entity204 ) discovered what had happened only recently			0
" unable to cope with the school 's e-mail system or to decrypt its rules for imputing family income , @entity204 finally dropped out of @entity176 , burdened by $ 61,000 in student debt			1
in 1943 , vice president @entity211 published a book celebrating the coming " century of the common man			0
" that century did not last very long			0
we have transitioned instead into the era of the clever man and clever woman			0
we have revised our institutions , our programs , our rules in ways that offer profitable new chances to those with cultural know - how -- and that inflict disastrous consequences on those who are overwhelmed by a world of ever - more - abundant and ever - more - risky choices			1
opinion : the end of the war on marijuana we 're not going to uninvent the no - money - down loan			2
universities that receive applications from all over the planet can not finance themselves like an old - fashioned state land - grant college			0
but we need to recognize that modern life is becoming steadily more dangerous for people prone to make bad choices			2
at a time when they need more help than ever to climb the ladder , marijuana legalization kicks them back down the ladder			2
the goal of public policy should not be to punish vulnerable kids for making life - wrecking mistakes			0
the goal of public policy should be to protect ( to the extent we can ) the vulnerable from making life - wrecking mistakes in the first place			0
there 's a trade - off , yes , and it takes the form of denying less vulnerable people easy access to a pleasure they believe they can safely use			1
but they are likely deluding themselves about how well they are managing their drug use			0
and even if they are not deluded -- if they really are so capable and effective -- then surely they can see that society has already been massively re-engineered for their benefit already			0
surely , enough is enough ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity277 .			1

@entity277 : casual use of marijuana should n't be a reason to lock people up
he says there are serious risks to brain development , mental health in using marijuana
@entity277 says it 's better to send simple message that marijuana is illegal
he says too often social rules become so complex many people ca n't navigate them
