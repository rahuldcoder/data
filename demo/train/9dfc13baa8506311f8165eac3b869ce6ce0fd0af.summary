-- two women died saturday -- one of them after being swept away moments after being inches from her would - be rescuers -- due to raging floodwaters in @entity8 , which braced for yet more drenching rains			1
at one point saturday , a storm and subsequent floods had knocked out power to about 12,000 customers and spurred the closure of dozens of streets in the @entity19 city and the surrounding county , authorities said			1
scores of people had to be evacuated due to floods and other issues , and fire chief @entity25 noted there had been about 250 water - related calls -- in addition to ones for things like medical emergencies , accidents and more -- in the first 15 hours of saturday			1
the greatest concern had to do with people getting too close to fast - moving , deceptive and unpredictable floodwaters			0
" we 're asking folks to observe low - water crossing ( warnings ) , to use common sense and to stay off the road if possible , " mayor @entity36 said			2
the first confirmed fatality -- a woman around age 30 -- was reported around 7:30 a.m. ( 8:30 a.m. et ) , and her body was about three hours later , police chief @entity43 said			0
some time later , an older female driver went into water that was 4 feet above flood markers			2
firefighters got to her vehicle and broke a window -- with one firefighter cutting his hand -- @entity25 explained			0
then , as the would - be rescuers tried to get her from her vehicle , " the currents changed and washed that vehicle away , " the fire chief said			2
the woman 's car had rolled on top of rescue boat , forcing out the firefighters who 'd been in it , fire department spokesman @entity61 later explained			1
by the time the firefighters were able to climb back into the boat , her car had become submerged in about 25 - foot deep water and was gone			1
@entity25 characterized authorities ' subsequent efforts to find this woman as " a body recovery			0
" described as being in her late 60s , the victim was found dead inside her vehicle around 6:45 p.m. , @entity61 said			1
" you can imagine how emotionally spent you are to try to rescue somebody , you 're face - to - face with them , and then they 're washed away , " @entity25 said of his distraught firefighters , who 'd gotten so close to rescuing the woman only to lose her			1
the chief warned more people may be missing and perhaps dead			0
firefighters happened to spot this woman going into the water before they rushed to rescue her ; there may be others , @entity25 pointed out , who firefighters or others do n't see get trapped in floodwaters			1
" turn around and do n't drown , " multiple officials repeated at a saturday news conference			0
the problems began with torrential rains late friday that continued into saturday , triggering flash - flood warnings across @entity19			1
the weather was windy and wet and included a reported tornado on friday in @entity104 , just west of @entity8 , that knocked down trees and power lines and caused " minor building damage , " according to the @entity108			2

" i came over here			0
i own the property , and my daughter said that she could n't get to her car			0
her car 's all flooded			2
the property -- the water 's all swarming through the whole house			2
i just came over to check to see what i could do , but there 's nothing that i can do right now			0
" @entity136 does n't have flood insurance because she " never imagined this would happen , " she said			0
" but it 's not stopping			0
i thought it was gon na stop , " she said about the water damage			0
@entity8 's previous record flooding in 1998 was devastating , caused by heavy rains throughout south @entity19 and by a plume of moist air from @entity160 off the @entity162 west coast			1
