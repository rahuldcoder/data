-- how can it be ? the @entity3 and @entity4 , sworn enemies for 35 years , are talking about working together to quell the @entity6 - inspired insurgency sweeping northern @entity7			1
they are fierce adversaries on issues such as terrorism , @entity4 's nuclear ambitions and @entity14 's civil war			0
@entity4 leaders call the @entity3 the " @entity19 , " while former president @entity16 labeled @entity4 as part of an " @entity18			1
" it was headline news last year when their leaders spoke briefly by phone , the first contact at that level since the @entity22 in 1979 drove the @entity3 - backed @entity25 from power			0
but should we be too surprised by this latest version of strange bedfellows , now known as " frenemies " in the modern vernacular ? there 's even an old saying of uncertain origin to define it -- the enemy of my enemy is my friend			0
what 's going on ? this time , the common enemy is the threat of a regional war based on sectarian battle lines , pitting @entity44 and @entity45 governments and peoples against each other across the @entity48			1
only the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) and its @entity6 backers would want that , it seems			0
they seek to establish a @entity44 - dominated @entity49 state stretching from @entity7 to northern @entity14			1
" we are now closer than ever to a regional war in the @entity48 , " @entity54 © rgio @entity53 , who heads the @entity55 on @entity14 , said tuesday			1
" events in neighboring @entity7 will have grave and violent repercussions for @entity14			0
the most dangerous aspect of these developments has been the rise of the sectarian threat , a direct consequence of the dominance of extremist groups like @entity49			0
" @entity45 majority @entity4 seeks to protect @entity45 interests and power in @entity7 , while the @entity3 wants to see a stable @entity7 after pulling its troops out of the country in 2011 to end its eight - year campaign that began by toppling @entity73 from power			1
also , @entity4 has sounded a more positive tone toward the @entity76 since last year 's election of president @entity78 to succeed the more volatile @entity79			0
where do things stand ? on monday , the @entity3 and @entity4 held " very brief discussions " about @entity7 and the threat posed by @entity49 on the sidelines of nuclear negotiations in @entity88 , @entity83 spokeswoman @entity82 said			1
secretary of state @entity89 suggested possible collaboration with @entity4 on monday , telling @entity91 that " we are open to discussions if there 's something constructive that can be contributed by @entity4 -- if @entity4 is prepared to do something that is going to respect the integrity and sovereignty of @entity7			1
" a senior @entity83 official said while @entity105 was open to engaging the @entity4 , " these engagements will not include military coordination or strategic determinations about @entity7 's future over the heads of the @entity7 people			2
" the official said on condition of not being identified that the discussion concerns the @entity49 threat to " many countries in the region , including @entity4 , " as well as the need to support a more inclusive approach by the @entity7 government than the sectarian efforts by prime minister @entity115			1
meanwhile , @entity117 foreign secretary @entity116 announced plans on tuesday for @entity117 to reopen its @entity120 embassy , which has been closed since an attack by protesters in 2011 triggered a dramatic breakdown in relations			0
what 's in it for the @entity3 ? even a conservative member of @entity128 who once advocated military strikes on @entity4 said @entity105 needs @entity120 's help			2
" the @entity4 can provide some assets to make sure @entity134 does n't fall , " sen. @entity131 of @entity132 told @entity0 on sunday			0
a host of experts agree , including @entity137 , a former deputy national security adviser during the @entity7 war			0
" there is a political solution here that i think could be both in @entity4 's interest and the @entity3 interest , " @entity137 said			2
whether the @entity3 likes it or not , working with @entity4 on the @entity7 crisis might be a necessary evil , retired maj. gen. @entity144 said			1
" there are necessary steps that we have to take with @entity120 that we 've probably never taken before , and would prefer not to take , " @entity149 said			0
what 's the downside ? teaming up with @entity4 could certainly have its pitfalls			0
the @entity3 is wary of furthering @entity4 's already considerable influence in @entity7			1
the @entity45 @entity4 regime is @entity115 's closest ally in the region , and a @entity3 - @entity4 partnership could alienate @entity7 's @entity44 population as well as @entity44 nations in the region such as @entity164 that are @entity3 allies			1
meanwhile , the @entity3 does n't want to jeopardize international talks on @entity4 's nuclear program that resumed this week			2
the talks are intended to prevent @entity4 from developing a nuclear weapon , and the @entity3 and @entity169 have repeatedly said they would use military means if necessary to achieve that outcome			2
will @entity4 and the @entity3 work together on the ground ? a senior security official in @entity134 said @entity4 has already sent about 500 @entity176 troops to help fight the @entity49 militants			1
@entity78 then denied that happened , but said he would be open to helping if asked , according to @entity4 state tv			0
a @entity181 spokesman said monday that military coordination with @entity4 was not in the cards , similar to what the senior @entity83 official told @entity0			0
back to @entity7 : what can -- and should -- the @entity3 do now ? @entity0 's @entity187 and @entity188 contributed to this report .			2
