@entity0 , @entity1 -- track star @entity3 broke down in court thursday , the fourth day of his murder trial , as a neighbor described the grisly scenes when he tried to save the athlete 's girlfriend after a fatal shooting on @entity11 2013			1
the amputee sprinter , 27 , nicknamed " @entity3 , " has pleaded not guilty to all four counts against him , saying the killing of model @entity15 , 29 , was a tragic error and he mistook her for an intruder			1
in graphic testimony , witness @entity19 , a doctor who lived close by , said he went to @entity3 ' residence after hearing shots fired			1
he said he saw @entity15 mortally wounded , her brain tissue mixed with blood and @entity3 praying for her to live			1
" i remember the first thing he said when i got there was , ' i shot her , i thought she was a burglar and i shot her , ' " @entity19 told the court in @entity0			1
he said he had arrived and found @entity15 's body lying at the bottom of the stairs			1
@entity3 was bent over her body with his left hand over her right groin and two fingers of his right hand in her mouth as he tried to clear her airway			1
@entity19 tried to assist and said he found no signs of pulse in her neck , no peripheral pulse nor breathing movements			0
as the doctor described the details of her injuries to the court , @entity3 broke down with his head in his hands			1
he was also seen convulsing but then recovered and wiped his face and nose with a handkerchief			0
@entity19 , who said he had trained in the army with assault rifles and 9 mm pistols -- the gun that killed @entity15 -- said he had been surprised to hear no ambulance had been called when he arrived			1
he left after it did			0
lawyers are battling over whether the world - famous athlete killed his girlfriend on purpose or by mistake when he fired four bullets through a closed bathroom door at her			0
' he wanted her to live ' @entity19 told the court he did not realize @entity3 lived in the house until the day after the shooting when his wife told him			1
the doctor was later cross-examined by defense attorney @entity76 , who has been working toward establishing that @entity3 was the one heard screaming after the shots were fired			1
@entity76 said he had consulted three specialists and the autopsy and asked @entity19 : " that person after the shots would not have been able to scream			0
that person would be nonresponsive , does that make sense to you as a medical doctor ? " " it does , " @entity19 replied			0
the prosecution interjected , saying @entity15 could have screamed after the first shot			1
earlier in the week , prosecutor @entity91 , reading a report from an expert , told the court that of the four bullets fired toward @entity15 " the fourth bullet hit her in the head			1
" @entity3 sat impassively during the exchange between @entity76 and @entity19			1
he leaned forward , his head down in his hand , as his attorney asked @entity19 if the athlete had wanted @entity15 to live			1
" he definitely wanted her to live , yes , " @entity19 replied			1
" he looked sincere to me			0
he was crying ; there were tears on his face			0
" after the court adjourned for the day thursday , @entity3 was in tears as his sister consoled him			1
witness grilled over notes earlier @entity76 had cross-examined another neighbor who testified that he heard shouting from @entity3 ' house before the shooting			1
@entity114 , husband of the trial 's first witness , was back on the stand after the defense team wanted to retrieve notes he had taken in the weeks after the shooting			1
@entity76 grilled @entity114 about the notes such as " the screams did not sound like fighting but more like the panic and distress calls of being attacked			2
" @entity76 established that @entity114 and his wife , @entity126 , thought they were hearing noise from a house break - in and not from an act of domestic violence			2
@entity91 said @entity76 was taking individual sentences out of context			0
@entity114 also testified he owns the same caliber gun as the one that killed @entity15 and he has fired a firearm before and knows what it sounds like			1
when @entity76 asked if he has heard it from the distance of one house to another , he said did not have a similar experience to relate it to but was convinced he knew what the noise sounds like regardless of distance			0
defense pokes holes the prosecution has put up several witnesses who live near @entity3 and say they heard shouting before the four gunshots that night , while his defense attorney has grilled them relentlessly to raise doubts about their version of events			1
@entity76 on wednesday said he had no doubt that @entity114 believed what he was saying -- but that whether what he was saying was true was a different question			0
the defense only has to show that there is reasonable doubt @entity3 intentionally killed @entity15			1
judge @entity164 will decide whether @entity3 is innocent or guilty			1
@entity1 does not have jury trials			0
@entity114 and his wife have testified to hearing shouts from @entity3 ' house before a series of gunshots around 3 a.m. @entity114 told investigators he and his wife did n't discuss their versions of events with each other			1
but on the stand , @entity114 said he did discuss how many shots he and his wife heard and the timing of those shots			0
" you and your wife could just as well have stood together in the witness box , " @entity76 remarked			0
for witnesses to be considered reliable , they have to maintain independent versions of events , @entity76 said			0
" you failed , mr. @entity114 , " he said			0
the lawyer then questioned @entity114 on whether what he heard that night was indeed gunshots			0
@entity76 said the sounds could have been @entity3 trying to break down the bathroom door with a cricket bat			1
pleading not guilty lawyers had briefly detoured wednesday into another of the four charges @entity3 faces , related to the discharge of a gun he was holding in a crowded restaurant in @entity199 about a month before the killing			2
@entity3 pleaded not guilty monday to one charge of murder and a firearms charge associated with @entity15 's killing as well as the two gun indictments unrelated to her death			1
the trial is expected to take at least three weeks			0
in @entity1 , premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence , with a minimum of 25 years			0
@entity3 also could get five years for each gun indictment and 15 years for the firearms charge			2
if he is n't convicted of premeditated murder , the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide , a crime based on negligence , and could be looking at up to 15 years on that charge , experts said			0

moments before , @entity3 said , he had pointed his 9 mm pistol toward an upstairs toilet room and fired four bullets through the locked door			2
in court documents , @entity3 has said he heard a noise from the bathroom in the middle of the night and -- feeling vulnerable without his prosthetic legs on -- charged toward the bathroom on his stumps			2
he has said he shot through the toilet door to protect himself and @entity15			1
" i felt a sense of terror rushing over me , " he said in his court affidavit			0
" there are no burglar bars across the bathroom window , and i knew that contractors who worked at my house had left the ladders outside			0
" it filled me with horror and fear of an intruder or intruders being inside the toilet			0
i thought he or they must have entered through the unprotected window			0
as i did not have my prosthetic legs on and felt extremely vulnerable , i knew i had to protect @entity15 and myself			2
" prosecutors are painting a different picture			0
they say the pair had an argument and that @entity15 locked herself in the toilet			2
at last year 's bail hearing , the state said @entity3 put on his prosthetic legs , collected his gun from under the bed and walked down the hall leading from the bedroom to the bathroom before unloading a flurry of shots through the door			2
