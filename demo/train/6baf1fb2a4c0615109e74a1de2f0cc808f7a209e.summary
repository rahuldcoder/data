take a look at ingredients for some varieties of @entity4 's bread and you 'll find a chemical that may seem unfamiliar and hard to pronounce : azodicarbonamide			1
to say this word , you would emphasize the syllable " bon " -- but the attention the chemical has been getting has not been good			1
besides bread , the chemical is also found in yoga mats and shoe soles to add elasticity			1
but it 's not long for bread at @entity4 : the company says it 's coming out			1
" even though this ingredient is safe , we are removing it from @entity4 bread			1
this process began last year and is nearly completed -- we have already developed an improved bread formula , conducted extensive performance and consumer testing on it , and pending final government approvals we should complete the entire conversion process within the coming weeks , " @entity4 said in a statement			1
@entity4 said azodicarbonamide is " an extremely common bread ingredient that is fully approved and recognized as safe by the @entity34			1
" the controversial chemical has been used by commercial bakers for the purpose of strengthening dough but has been poorly tested , according to the @entity39			1
one of the breakdown products , derived from the original substance , is called urethane , a recognized carcinogen , the organization says			0
using azodicarbonamide at maximum allowable levels results in higher levels of urethane in bread " that pose a small risk to humans , " @entity39 said			0
another breakdown product is semicarbazide , which poses " a negligible risk to humans " but was found to cause cancers of the lung and blood vessels in mice , @entity39 said			2
@entity39 advocates for reducing the amount of the chemical that is allowed to be used			2
" we urge the @entity34 to consider whether the @entity63 amendment , which bars the use of food additives that cause cancer in humans or animals , requires the agency to bar its use , " @entity39 said			2
the @entity34 has said that the additive can not exceed 0.0045 % by weight of the flour when used in as a " dough conditioner			1
" the @entity75 told @entity76 : " past @entity34 sampling results have indicated appropriate low level use in products			2
as a dough conditioner it has a volume / texture effect on the finished loaf			2
it is a functional ingredient that improves the quality of bread and any substitutes are likely not to work as well as @entity88 ( azodicarbonamide )			0
" food blogger @entity89 , of the popular food blog @entity89 , originally drew public attention to this issue , @entity39 said			1
she has written about @entity4 ingredients several times since 2012 , this week she launched a petition urging @entity4 to stop using azodicarbonamide			2
more than 67,000 people signed			0
grocery store breads and restaurant breads also contain this chemical			0
other major fast food chains have products with the ingredient too , including @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 's			0
@entity108 's has also responded to concerns about the chemical with regard to its @entity113 sandwich buns , but continues to use the chemical in that product			0
@entity108 's notes on its website that a " variation of @entity120 has commercial uses and is used in the production of some foamed plastics , like exercise mats			1
but this should n't be confused with the food - grade variation of this ingredient			0
" @entity120 is not legally allowed to be used as a dough improver in the @entity129 , according to the @entity130			1
it is also banned in @entity132			0
a 1999 report from an international group of health experts , published by the @entity136 , says some studies suggest that the chemical can induce asthma , based on evidence from people with symptoms and employees of facilities where the chemical is manufactured or used			0
but use of the chemical in the workplace is very different , and carries much greater exposure than eating a tiny amount in bread			0
the report notes that the concentration required to produce asthmatic reactions is unknown			0
" the level of risk is uncertain ; hence , exposure levels should be reduced as much as possible , " who said .			0
