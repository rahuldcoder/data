-- nearly four years after the @entity4 president was deposed in a coup , the country 's congress will add an impeachment process to its constitution , hoping to deter future political crises			1
a decree to reform the constitution on the matter of impeachment passed tuesday night with overwhelming support			2
an impeachment process will help prevent authoritarianism , said @entity16 , a writer who also is former congressman and presidential candidate			1
in june 2009 , the @entity4 military carried out an order from the country 's @entity20 to remove president @entity22 from office			1
@entity22 had been at odds with the other branches of government over his desire to to run for another term , and the court determined that the president had violated the constitution			0
without a clear interpretation of the constitution , the military ended up sending @entity22 into exile , and the country fell into a political crisis that other nations simply called a coup			2
the episode was a black eye for the country , and to this day , a minority still question the legitimacy of the current government			0
the 2009 coup and ensuing crisis could have been avoided if there was a clear impeachment process , @entity16 said			1
" from my point of view there is a hole in this area and as long as this hole is not closed , it can be filled by special interests , whims and authoritarianism , " he said in a statement posted on the congressional website			0
the decree , which aims to " make effective the principal of public servants ' responsibility , " still must pass through some hoops before the constitution is modified			0
the reform must be voted on again once the next congressional term begins this month			0
once ratified , new laws detailing the impeachment process must be written			1
as written , tuesday 's decree envisions precisely the situation that @entity4 faced with the @entity22 debacle			2
the impeachment process would be used when there are " grave accusations against a person 's post by acting contrary to the constitution or the national interest , and by negligence , incapacity and incompetence , " the decree states			1
these are the same things that the @entity20 and congress accused @entity22 of during his attempt to run for another term			0
impeachment would require a three - fourths majority in congress			2
the measure is not without its critics , who question whether @entity4 ' legislative branch is mature enough to wield such power without abuse			1
the first movement toward a decree came last summer , immediately after @entity100 's president , @entity99 , was removed from office through an impeachment proceeding			2
while @entity100 's solution for ousting a president was legitimated by the country 's laws , many cite it as an example of how impeachment can be abused			0
@entity99 was removed from office in a matter of days , with hardly a chance to defend himself			0
the process that removed him may have been legal , but it caused a stir all the same because it seemed to have been used as a political weapon			0
an impeachment process for @entity4 " is very risky and is unacceptable , " a former president , @entity116 , told @entity118 newspaper last year			1
knowing the political divide that exists in @entity4 and the vengefulness that dominates the traditional parties , the advent of impeachment will generate chaos , he said			1
but the legislation is popular among the public , and it follows a suggestion made in 2011 by a truth commission appointed to examine the political turmoil of 2009			0
to avoid a repetition of the institutional fights that led to the capture and expulsion of @entity22 , an impeachment process is necessary , the commission 's final report said			1
journalist @entity138 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity4 congress passes a decree to create an impeachment process
supporters say it is needed to avoid political crises
a 2009 coup and *subsequent* *fallout* could have been avoided with such a law , some say
others wonder if @entity4 institutions are mature enough to handle such power
