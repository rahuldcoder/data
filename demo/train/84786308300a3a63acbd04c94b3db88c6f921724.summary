@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity0 's @entity5 organizers needed a knockout venue that would wow the @entity7 and hold the world 's attention , they turned to @entity10 , a provocateur who critics have described as " the @entity14 of architecture "			1
@entity16 - born @entity10 is one of the greatest architects alive			1
in 2004 , she became the first woman to win the @entity19 , architecture 's greatest honor			1
the year prior , she was awarded the @entity23 @entity22 for a tram station in @entity25			2
besides art museums and opera houses , she has designed temporary pop - up structures -- such as a handbag - inspired mobile pavilion for @entity31 -- a ski jump in @entity33 , furniture , door handles , a tea and coffee set and vase for @entity39 , and plastic high heels for @entity43 shoe brand @entity41			1
not all of her work is exclusively for the wealthy			2
she also won last year 's @entity46 for redesigning a state school in @entity48 , @entity0			1
@entity10 's @entity49 is the first venue you see when you enter the @entity5 village			1
a £ 269m facility that houses two swimming pools and a diving pool , and seats 22,500 , critics have pronounced it the @entity5 " most majestic " space			1
but for decades , @entity10 languished in the shadows , her work dismissed as " unbuildable " and her atelier rarely commissioned in her adopted city			1
" i will always have two regrets , " she told leading women			2
" i do n't have a presence in @entity0 , and i would have liked to have done more work in the @entity68			2
" more from leading women : @entity71 astronaut who inspired women architecture was a dream of @entity10 's since she was a young girl and , in @entity76 , where she lived until a teenager , it was all around her			1
" many of the great architects of the time like @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 and @entity83 all designed projects for @entity76 , " she says			2
@entity10 's father headed the @entity86 , a progressive force in @entity16 in the 1930s and 1940s			1
" in the @entity92 world , like @entity43 and in @entity90 , it was about nation building in that period and also about identity , " @entity10 recalls			1
" there was a moment of renaissance , of trying to build a new era and adopt some of these modernist ideas like they did in @entity101 ( a renowned example of urban planning in northern @entity104 ) or @entity105			2
that was an incredible moment of excitement and that 's also why i think it intrigued me at the time			1
" after an education at the @entity112 , @entity10 studied architecture at @entity0 's @entity114			1
it was the 1970 's , a time when , she says , the 1968 student uprisings had invigorated experimentation			1
" there were so many different ideologies ... there was a lot of focus on drawing at the time , and the idea of the school was really to pick your way through some labyrinth ideas			2
looking back , it was very exciting			0
" among @entity10 's teachers was radical @entity134 theorist @entity133 , with whom @entity10 worked upon graduating in 1977			1
two years later , though , she founded her own practice near @entity136 in @entity137			0
today , it employs more than 300 people and brings in around $ 50 - 75 million annually			1
deploying the ideas that galvanized her in architecture school has not been easy , and acceptance has come slowly for @entity10			1
after winning a 1994 competition to design an opera house for @entity146 in @entity147 , her modernist design was derided by critics and locals , and ultimately rejected in favor of a stadium			1
it was a slap in the face for @entity10 , who still describes the experience as " traumatic "			1
" it became a cause celebre , " she recalls			0
" everyone was trying to prove a point , which was not to allow people to win a major project who are not known , who are not part of the establishment			1
they did n't like the fact i was not @entity167 and i think ( being a ) woman was also a factor			1
" " after that , " she says , " we were stigmatized			0
people remembered there was a problem but they do n't know what happened "			0
@entity10 's major breakthrough came in 2003 , when she designed the @entity177 and @entity178 , in @entity179			1
describing her as " a cultish figure who has built very little of note " , one critic nevertheless pronounced this building " a virtuoso composition "			0
the @entity19 followed , and attitudes toward her wild , avant - garde aesthetic softened			1
@entity189 : six life lessons from @entity192 ceo today , @entity10 is internationally feted			1
her work is found in @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199			0
she is a @entity200 of the @entity201 and a @entity202 in @entity203			0
she is an honorary member of the @entity204 and an honorary fellow of @entity206			0
she has honorary degrees from @entity208 and the @entity209 , and has been named one of @entity212 's 100 most influential people			1
in part , she is also celebrated for breaking ground , as a woman in a male - dominated field			1
it 's an accolade she is begrudgingly happy to accept			1
" i used to not like being called a woman architect : i 'm an architect , not just a woman architect , " she says			2
" guys used to tap me on the head and say " you are okay for a girl "			0
but i see the incredible amount of need from other women for reassurance that it could be done , so i do n't mind that at all			0
" @entity10 was awarded this year 's @entity229 prize for her contribution to the status of women in architecture , something confirmed in a poll of her peers conducted by the @entity237			1
some poll respondents argued that she could not be considered a role model for working mothers , but @entity10 says although she has no children , this was n't a conscious decision			1
" i just did n't have them			0
people think i made a sacrifice , but it was n't the case			0
i do n't think people should do things because you know " i am turning this age , i must go have a husband "			0
if you find somebody and it works out then have kids , it 's very nice			1
but if you do n't , you do n't			0
" @entity260 ceo : ' having it all ' is pure nonsense in the world of architecture , a classic juncture on the career path involves building a tower , something @entity10 did not achieve until 2004 , when she designed the offices for a @entity271 shipping firm			1
her take involved a peculiarly striking base			0
" we got this idea of the building having a skirt , " she told @entity212 , " maybe because i 'm a woman , so i know how to wear one — who knows ? — but also because it swirls at the bottom to accommodate public areas on the ground , the lobbies			2
" despite having achieved so much , @entity10 still believes her outsider status as a @entity286 woman in architecture , particularly in @entity0 , as a mixed blessing			1
" being a woman , i do n't have a stereotype			2
they let you get away with things they would not let someone else get away with , " she says			0
" on the other hand , because you are not a woman , not a @entity300 guy , there are certain territories that , no matter what you do , you can not enter			2
i 'm not part of the brotherhood			0
i will never be golfing with these guys or on a boat trip			0
i mean , it 's not going to happen			2
" " in @entity310 , it 's different			2
relationships between men and women professionally are more normalized ... but not so much ( in @entity167 )			0
" " contrary to popular view , i 've never been patronized in the @entity68 , " she adds			0
" men maybe treat women differently but they do not treat them with disrespect			0
they do n't hate women			0
it 's a very different kind of mentality			2
" she attributes much of her current success to two unlikely sources : simmering resentment over her failed @entity146 design , and to sleeplessness			1
" after the whole @entity146 mess , everyone thought i would give up			0
there was no reason for me to carry on , but i had to , " she says			0
" i made a very conscious decision in 1996			0
i thought , i am not going to let them get away with this , and i have to move on			0
it was n't only me -- there were another 10 , 15 , 20 people in my office who knew there was no work			0
we were all desperate and they carried on as well			0
" shared excitement over the work they were doing kept @entity10 's team going , she says , and from the communal suffering of pulling all - nighters , genius emerged			1
" when you are overworked and exhausted there was a sense of delirium			2
i remember doing four nights in a row with no sleep			0
unless you are crazy , nobody would do that , but you are totally focused on the project			0
nothing else matters , things could be falling around you -- and that 's what induces great ideas			2
you are semi-isolated with a bunch of people and it 's very exciting			2
" these days , she says , " we are slightly more relaxed " , and she is now driven more by a simple desire to do good work			0
" i really think that things can be done much better generally , " she says			0
" i have lots of ideas and , of course , just like everything else , you have to edit them , but as an architect you just want to make better and better spaces			0

@entity16 - born @entity10 is the first woman to win architecture 's @entity19 .
her @entity382 is considered the @entity5 's most *important* venue .
as a woman and @entity286 , @entity10 still feels an outsider , but this sometimes works in her favor , she says .
she attributes her drive to past failures and the delirium of sleeplessness .
