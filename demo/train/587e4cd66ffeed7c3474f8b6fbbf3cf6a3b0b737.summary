-- it 's the question @entity2 is constantly asked			1
" you ask me again about war ... " sighs the 28 - year - old , rolling his eyes and smiling as he enjoys a rare moment of peace outside @entity8 's team hotel in the picturesque suburb of @entity10			1
perhaps the line of questioning is understandable given that just a short drive away is @entity2 's home city of @entity18 , where the national hero lived throughout the @entity20 which raged between 1992 and 1995			1
the war in @entity8 left tens of thousands dead , and hundreds of thousands displaced			1
but just as the bullet holes which still riddle this land represent a gruesome past , @entity2 and his teammates have become symbols of a different more optimistic future			1
for the first time in its short history , @entity8 is off to the @entity31			1
" i never thought i would be where i am now , " @entity2 , who played a key role in @entity35 's 2013 - 14 @entity34 title triumph , told @entity0			1
@entity2 's early years were played out against the devastating backdrop of the consequences of a brutal internecine conflict			1
" i started to play football when i was about 10 , my father brought me to one school because there were more pitches where we could play			2
everything was destroyed after the war			0
" in previous interviews @entity2 has spoken of how his family home was destroyed and he was forced to live in his grandparents ' house with 15 of his relatives			1
his mother once inadvertently saved his life , calling him inside seconds before the land he was playing on was hit by bombs			0
the siege of @entity18 followed the break - up of the former @entity58 , with conflict erupting between the ethnic groups which make up @entity8 -- chiefly @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			2
modern - day @entity8 is an independent state , although still under international administration			2
" i was here all the time during the war and i know what it is , but i think we came out stronger , " explains @entity2			1
" we want to show the world that even if you go through some bad periods , you always have to think positive just to go forward			0
" some people had a very hard life , we are still making positives and i think that 's amazing			0
" amid the bombs and bullets , @entity2 forged an unlikely path to the top			2
after signing his first professional contract in @entity8 , the young striker earned a move to @entity84 in the @entity85 before getting his big break with @entity87 in the @entity89 @entity88			1
he became one of the hottest properties in @entity93 football during a prolific spell which saw him score 67 @entity88 goals in three - and - a - half seasons , with @entity35 winning the race for his signature after paying @entity87 a reported $ 45 million in january 2011			2
while @entity2 carries echoes of the fighting wherever he goes , other members of the @entity8 squad had a different experience			1
@entity104 and his family left @entity106 , 80 miles south of @entity18 , and headed to @entity89 before immigrating to @entity107			0
aged four when his family relocated , @entity104 has no memories of the conflict which engulfed his homeland			0
" and it 's probably better so , " the 26 - year - old goalkeeper , who plays in @entity114 for @entity115			0
" i mean it 's obviously very bad memories , very bad experiences for some of my other family members who have been around and stayed for the war			0
" i left when i was a boy , so i really do n't remember much from the past			0
" as i 've gotten older i 've educated myself a little on the situation and what happened , drawn on experiences from my family members and friends , who lived through it and it was just a very unpleasant experience as people can imagine			0
" for our quality of life as a family , just being able to be safe in a different country meant a lot to us			0
" although @entity104 's life abroad has left its mark on his voice -- he speaks perfect @entity141 with a slight @entity143 accent -- he insists his upbringing was distinctly @entity8			2
" i 've always been very close to the country , " he says			0
" when the opportunity came it was a fantastic thing for myself and my family to do , i could n't wait to put on a @entity8 shirt and i have n't really looked back since			2
" neither has @entity8 's national football team			1
since an inauspicious first official international match in november 1995 -- a 2 - 0 reverse away to @entity153 -- " the @entity154 " have gone from strength to strength			0
bids to qualify for the @entity158 and the 2012 @entity159 fell agonizingly short , with @entity160 ending the team 's hopes at the playoff stage of both qualification competitions			2
but , on october 15 , 2013 in the @entity168 capital city of @entity169 , a goal from striker @entity166 sealed a 1 - 0 win for @entity171 's @entity8 and passage to @entity173 2014			1
cue wild celebrations on the streets of @entity18 , with the team flying home to be greeted by 50,000 ecstatic @entity8 football fans			1
" i am proud of this team that we achieved some great things , that we did some things that nobody could do it before us , " said @entity2			1
" when you see 50,000 there waiting for you , then you know you did something good			0
" " we 've learned from our past , we 've learned from our failures and i think we 've definitely grown as a team and we 've been able to overcome that final hurdle now , " added @entity104			0
" to receive such an ovation and such a reception from our people , being able to celebrate with them is what qualifying and being able to qualify for major tournaments is all about			0
" it 's something we have all accomplished together			0
" now @entity201 's iconic @entity200 awaits			0
at the arena first built for the 1950 @entity31 and lavishly redeveloped for @entity173 's second hosting of the tournament , @entity8 will take its bow against a @entity207 - led @entity206			1
@entity210 winners @entity208 and @entity211 are the other two teams which make up a tough @entity213 " i 'm very much looking forward to it , " says @entity104 , who will be trying to keep out four - time @entity214 winner @entity207			1
" that 's what football is all about , being able to work your whole life to get to a @entity31 and then playing against one of the biggest football countries in the world in the opening game			1
" obviously we 're massive underdogs , so we 've got nothing to lose in that game , we can go there with an open mind and see how we can beat them			0
" it 's going to be a huge challenge , but i believe in the quality of our team and we can cause @entity206 problems			1
" with players like @entity104 and @entity2 , not to mention @entity238 playmaker @entity237 , @entity8 have players capable of upsetting the odds			1
and in @entity2 , they also have a leader who is determined to show how far his country has come in the last 20 years			2
" i love this country , i love my country , " he said			0
" i am very happy that i am born here and i am very happy that i know that i will always , always come back here			0
" i think we all just ca n't wait for this @entity31 to start			2
" interactive : take the pulse of the @entity249			0

@entity8 will play at the @entity31 for the first time in its short history
first major tournament the team has played at since gaining independence in 1992
@entity35 striker @entity2 is the biggest star in a team
@entity8 will play in @entity213 , *alongside* @entity206 , @entity208 and @entity211
