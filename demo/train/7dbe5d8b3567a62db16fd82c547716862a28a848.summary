@entity0 , @entity1 , which was formed last year by president @entity10 , said the preliminary results will be announced saturday in @entity12 in @entity1 and on february 2 in @entity0 , @entity1 's capital			1
" if there is no appeal , the final results will be announced on february 7 , " said justice @entity13 , deputy chairman of the commission			1
" but if there is an appeal or appeals , they have to be discussed , and the final announcement will then be on february 14			1
" @entity1 voted in a weeklong referendum in early january on whether to form an independent state			1
preliminary results show 99 % voted for independence with most of the count in the south completed			2
the commission faced three challenges during the referendum process : the legal aspect of the referendum itself , time and finances , according to commission chairman @entity35			2
" in these kinds of situations , where there are political negotiations , there is a lot of give and take , " @entity35 said , " and this reflected on the law			0
" " the law itself was framed in an unclear way with much repetition			0
... it was shaky , " he said			0
nevertheless , @entity35 said , the referendum commission , which includes southern @entity1 and northern @entity1 members , worked easily together , " making decisions in accord			1
" @entity35 said the commission did not have much time to conduct its work			0
" it was conceived by those who signed the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) that the referendum process would take 42 months , " he said			2
" by the time the referendum commission was established , we had four months			2
" the referendum on whether to declare independence from the government based in the north is part of a 2005 peace agreement that helped end a two - decade - long war			1
the war pitted a government dominated by @entity70 in northern @entity1 against black @entity71 or animists in the south			1
the conflict left about 2 million people dead			0
@entity76 was also a challenge for the referendum , @entity35 said			2
" the international funding was generous but not made available for @entity1 expertise , " he said			1
" if we had more funding , we would have included more @entity1 experts to give the referendum an added national face			1
" both the federal government of @entity1 and the government of south @entity1 had committed themselves to funding the referendum with 400 million @entity1 pounds ( about $ 160 million ) , @entity35 said , but the commission only received 26.6 million sdg in the north , and 60 million sdg in the south			1
@entity13 also pointed to " logistical difficulties " in the south during the referendum			0
" we used human porters who delivered material on their heads to transport the materials and kits to the counties			0
" however , @entity13 said , the high turnout was historical			0
" it is something that has never happened in @entity1 ; in fact some say it never happened anywhere			1
" @entity13 said once the counting is done , the rest will be up to the politicians			0
issues such as borders , the future of the oil - rich border district of @entity113 , citizenship rights and how to manage international debts are yet to be resolved			0
" we were able to finish in five months what was supposed to be done in three years , " he said			0
" so unless we are told to come back ... we we would like to take a beautiful vacation			0

the @entity8 was formed last year
it organized a referendum on whether to split @entity1 from a government based in the north
final results are *expected* in early february
