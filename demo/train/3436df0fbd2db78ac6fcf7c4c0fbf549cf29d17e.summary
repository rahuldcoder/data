-- president @entity1 once famously said , " the most difficult job in the world is not being president			0
it 's being a parent			0
" as mothers , we both know this well , but we wonder if president @entity1 's fellow democrats share his respect for parents , particularly those who choose to stay home with their children ? yesterday on @entity0 , @entity15 , a @entity16 insider who has advised many prominent @entity17 , made the ill - advised decision to attack a fellow parent , a stay - at - home mother , by accusing her of having " never worked a day in her life			1
" the stay - at - home mother targeted maliciously by @entity15 has successfully raised five boys , who all have their own families now and constructively contribute to society			2
this particular mother has battled cancer and multiple sclerosis			0
this particular stay - at - home mom travels the country and speaks up on issues of importance to her and for her children and grandchildren 's future			1
this particular stay - at - home mother is also a @entity38 , her name is @entity40 and her message is resonating			2
therein lies the reason for @entity15 's vicious attack			1
after calls for her to apologize from both the left and the right , @entity15 initially refused			2
but she caved to the building pressure today			0
in her apology she said , " let 's declare peace in this phony war and go back to focus on the substance			0
" we could n't agree more -- so let 's look at the substance , and the facts , which is what @entity40 and many other women have been doing all along			1
comment on @entity61 's wife keeps campaign 's focus on women as her husband moves toward locking up the @entity38 nomination , recent headlines have screamed that @entity40 is the " @entity61 that @entity17 fear most			1
" and for good reason			0
pundits point out that she is passionate , attractive , charismatic and elegant -- all true -- but we would argue that what @entity17 truly fear is her message and the impact it is having with women of all walks of life			1
recently , @entity61 made headlines when she said , " women care about jobs			1
women care about the economy , they care about their children , they care about their debt			0
they 're angry , they 're furious about the entitlement debt we 're leaving our children			0
meanwhile , @entity17 preen on about the phony " war on women " and are increasingly desperate to lure attention away from their disastrous policies			1
the women we know are smarter than this and realize this is merely a smokescreen meant to distract women voters from the true legacy of the @entity104 administration : failed economic policies that adversely affect women			1
in her stunning comments , @entity15 claims @entity61 " never really dealt with the kind of economic issues that a majority of women in the country are facing			1
" moms all across this country look to the unemployment numbers , which have disproportionately affected women , and worry about their families ' immediate future and security			0
moms look to record high gas prices as they begin to plan summer road trips			0
women make 80 % of all health care decisions in our country , so it 's no wonder a consistent majority of them oppose @entity129			2
moms know how to make and maintain a budget and are left wondering why it has taken @entity133 over 1,050 days to pass a budget in the male - dominated , @entity136 - led @entity135			0
moms know the crushing legacy that debt can leave and are outraged that , as of today , each of our children owes $ 50,017.33 of the national debt			0
this is the legacy of the @entity104 administration , and this is why liberals like ms. @entity15 make personal attacks on mothers like @entity40 , rather than debate the issues most important to women			1
more and more women like @entity40 are standing up and speaking out			1
women are joining the political arena in droves , both as activists and as candidates			1
moms like @entity159 and @entity160 have put their name on the ballot in opposition to the @entity104 agenda			2
this november , we could elect five new conservative women -- @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 -- to the @entity135 , ending the do - nothing - but - harm reign of @entity133			1
the tea party movement has been fueled and run by " just moms " like @entity175 who are scared for their children 's future and are taking a stand			0
the left 's war on moms exposes their true feelings towards women -- that we are the victims , the proverbial damsels in distress waiting for @entity16 to come riding in atop its white horse named bureaucracy to fix our families , prescribe our medications and send our children the bill			2
what the left will learn over the next seven months is that those women are n't victims , they are fierce warriors who fight for their principles			0
the election of 2012 promises to be fought on the issues and it will be won by women			2
