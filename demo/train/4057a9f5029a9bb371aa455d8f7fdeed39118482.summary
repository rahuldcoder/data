in the intraparty battle for the @entity1 , score round 1 for the @entity1 establishment over the tea party			1
@entity5 projects that @entity7 house speaker @entity6 has won the state 's @entity9 primary			1
@entity6 , who was backed by many mainstream republicans , topped 40 % of the primary vote tuesday , avoiding a runoff in july			1
@entity6 beat a bunch of more conservative candidates for the chance to face off this november against first - term @entity18 sen. @entity17 , who is considered very vulnerable in the general election			1
flipping her seat and five others held by @entity18 would give @entity1 control of the @entity9			2
in his victory speech , @entity6 slammed @entity17 's record , tying her to senate majority leader @entity26 and calling them " an echo chamber for president @entity30 's worst ideas			1
" " we need to be clear , it 's not the end of a primary , it 's really the beginning of a primary mission , which has been the mission all along and that is to beat @entity17 and to make @entity26 irrelevant , " he said			1
@entity39 stumbles and four other takeaways from election night " you know , their failures , both @entity30 's and @entity17 's , are obvious , " @entity6 added			1
" we know a lot of them -- our government is borrowing too much money and it 's dangerously in debt to @entity50			0
and @entity30 and @entity17 's left - wing political agenda is driving up our energy prices and making our country less safe			2
" for six years , she 's voted with @entity30 and against @entity7 , " he said			2
trailing @entity6 is @entity56 activist @entity55			2
he enjoyed the support of many tea party groups , other influential conservative organizations and endorsements from the likes of sens. @entity62 of @entity63 and @entity39 of @entity64 , who joined @entity55 on monday at a rally in @entity66			1
@entity67 , a prominent baptist minister who helped drive the 2012 passage of a constitutional amendment that strengthened the state 's same - sex marriage ban , is on his way to a third - place finish			0
@entity67 was backed by a high - profile fellow pastor , former @entity76 gov. @entity74 , a 2008 @entity1 presidential candidate who may run again in 2016			0
since the birth of the tea party movement in 2009 , primary challenges from the right have produced major headlines and headaches for the @entity1 and hurt the party 's chances of winning back the @entity9 from @entity18 in the past two election cycles			1
candidates backed by the tea party movement and other grass - roots conservatives effectively cost the @entity1 five winnable @entity9 elections the past two cycles in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			1
the establishment strikes back this election cycle , mainstream republicans do n't want another sequel			0
in @entity7 , @entity6 won recent endorsements from two high - profile @entity1 : 2012 presidential nominee @entity101 and former @entity103 gov. @entity102 , a potential 2016 @entity104 hopeful			1
more importantly , while none of the candidates in the @entity1 primary , including @entity6 , raised or spent a lot of money in the campaign , the state house speaker won the backing of the @entity114 @entity113 and @entity115 , two outside groups that combined have spent millions this cycle to run ads in support of @entity6 and other establishment picks that they feel are " electable " come november			1
last week , in what was described as a major buy , the pro-business @entity113 launched a television commercial that described @entity6 as " a bold conservative who balanced our budget and reduced regulations			0
a businessman who delivered tax relief			0
" and @entity115 , the big - spending outside group co-founded and steered by @entity132 , says it has spent nearly $ 2 million in support of @entity6			0
that spending dwarfed the money shelled out by outside conservative groups that backed @entity55			0
" it was clear from the start that @entity6 is the only proven conservative who can defeat @entity17 and take on president @entity30 's liberal agenda , and tonight 's victory is the first step toward making that happen , " said @entity115 president and ceo @entity137			1
@entity39 was quick to back @entity6			0
" now that the primary is over , it is time for our side to unite to defeat the @entity150 who cast the deciding vote for @entity51 , @entity17 , in november			1
i endorse @entity6 and look forward to working with him in the @entity9 , " @entity39 wrote on @entity152			0
and a top tea party leader who had backed @entity55 sounded conciliatory			1
" while we obviously are n't happy with the outcome , we congratulate speaker @entity6 for his win , " said @entity156 ' @entity155			2
" the important thing now is to pick up a @entity161 seat that 's been in liberal hands for the last six years			0
" national democrats argue that the competitive primary pushed @entity6 too far to the right for the more mainstream electorate in november			2
" @entity6 spent this primary moving far to the right , embracing positions that , paired with his record , make him a deeply flawed candidate , " said @entity167 , @entity168 press secretary			2
@entity174 has slim edge in @entity7 primary more rounds to come the voting tuesday in @entity7 , as well as @entity94 and @entity179 , kicks off five straight weeks of primary contests that should give a clearer indication of whether establishment @entity1 have gained the upper hand against the tea party movement for control of the party			1
two more showdowns between establishment and grass - roots conservatives come on may 20 , as the action moves to @entity191 and @entity64 , where @entity192 leader @entity192 faces a long - shot challenge from businessman @entity194 , who is backed by many tea party groups and by some influential conservative organizations			1
in @entity191 , there 's a wide - open , free - for - all fight to succeed retiring @entity1 sen. @entity198			0
the candidates considered to be more moderate are polling ahead of the more conservative candidates			0
two weeks later , on june 3 , the establishment - vs. - tea party faceoff shifts to @entity203 , which is one of eight states holding primaries that day			1
six - term sen. @entity207 is facing a serious challenge from state lawmaker @entity209 , but private polling indicates the incumbent has a comfortable lead			0
victories by the more moderate mainstream candidates improve the @entity1 's odds of recapturing the @entity9 this november			2
@entity18 hold a 55 - 45 majority in the chamber but are defending 21 of the 36 seats up in november			0
half of those @entity18 seats are in red or purple states , such as @entity7			0
tea party leaders say they 've ' changed the narrative ' leaders of the grass - roots movement disagree that their defeat in the @entity228 primary suggests that the tide has turned against them			1
" i think the establishment is taking its victory lap a little early , " said @entity230 , spokesman for the @entity231			0
and regardless of the outcome of the primary contests , @entity234 says the tea party is already victorious			1
" the tea party has already won because we have changed the narrative and the political landscape in @entity242			1
now , both sides of the aisle express concern about our ballooning national debt , " said @entity234 , who just stepped down as chairwoman of the @entity244 and is now helping @entity194 in his bid to unseat @entity246 in @entity64			0
' @entity252 ' star holds slim lead while the @entity9 contest in @entity7 landed in the national spotlight , some @entity104 primaries also grabbed attention			1
two - term @entity1 rep. @entity258 faced a primary challenge from a conservative talk radio host because of her being open to considering some limited immigration reform			2
but she cruised to victory in the @entity1 primary in the state 's 2nd @entity264			1
her re-election bid may grab even more national attention if former " @entity252 " star @entity174 wins the @entity18 nomination in the district			2
the race between @entity174 and two other @entity18 candidates is still too close to call			1
with all precincts reporting , @entity174 has 40.83 % of the vote , with @entity274 just behind at 39.4 %			0
if the margin holds up , @entity174 would exceed the 40 % threshold needed to avoid a runoff			2
and while only 369 votes separated them , @entity174 's tiny advantage is still outside the 1 % margin to stave off a recount			0
@entity174 told supporters tuesday night that he was " confident " his campaign would be victorious			0
" i said earlier tonight , i sort of preferred when they just open the envelope , " he said , a reference to his days on the " @entity252 " stage			0
in the state 's 3rd @entity264 , @entity5 projects that 10 - term @entity292 rep. @entity292 , an anti-war libertarian , has won a hard - fought primary against establishment pick @entity296 , a former @entity297 administration official who also had a senior role in @entity102 's 2004 re-election campaign			2
@entity179 showdowns in @entity179 , @entity302 executive @entity301 won the @entity18 gubernatorial nomination			0
@entity301 , a former @entity304 agent , mayor and assistant county prosecutor , easily topped @entity307 , a former tow - truck driver from the @entity309 area			0
@entity301 will now face off in november against @entity310 gov. @entity310 , who 's running for re-election			0
the contest could turn into a marquee gubernatorial battle			0
house speaker @entity314 easily won his primary			2
the 12 - term @entity1 lawmaker , who represents @entity179 's 8th @entity264 , a @entity1 stronghold in the southwest part of the @entity179 , topped two tea party - backed challengers			1
primaries a key test of @entity1 establishment - tea party battle			1

@entity6 says the " primary mission " is " to beat @entity17 "
