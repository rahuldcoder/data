@entity11 's reigning champions are proving just as formidable opposition this year as they were last with @entity14 's men stealing all three points in @entity7 's backyard for the second successive season			1
@entity18 gave @entity4 the lead in the 10th minute redirecting @entity21 's corner past @entity22 to silence the home crowd before parity was restored from a familiar source 16 minutes later			2

@entity7 proceeded to dominate the rest of the half but @entity4 weathered the storm with @entity35 pulling off a notable point - blank save from a @entity43 header in the 38th minute			1
the deadlock in an evenly contested second half was finally broken by the visitors with 14 minutes remaining when a @entity48 dummy left subsitute @entity49 ( who replaced captain @entity51 in the 60th minute ) to sweep home a low shot into the left corner of @entity22 ' net			2
