-- champion jockey @entity1 has vowed to " rebuild his reputation " after accepting a six - month suspension , having been found guilty of using a banned substance			1
@entity1 , who will be 42 this month , tested positive in @entity6 on september 16 for a drug that has widely reported by @entity9 media to have been cocaine			1
he was cautioned by police for possession of the drug in 1993			2
@entity14 , the country 's horse racing ruling body , announced on wednesday that the @entity18 will be banned from november 20 to may 19 , though it did not reveal the substance in question			1
it has asked other horse racing authorities around the world to enforce its decision			2
" for similar cases , @entity14 has never revealed the substances found and will therefore not reveal the substance for this specific case , " spokesman @entity24 said			0
@entity1 's legal representative @entity29 said the jockey had accepted the punishment			1
" he also accepts that he has let down the sport he loves and all those associated with it , as well as the wider public , " @entity29 said in a statement			2
" but most of all , and this is his greatest regret , he has let down his wife and children			0
" @entity1 , who has five children with wife @entity41 , is one of the world 's most successful jockeys			1
he is most famous for riding seven successive winners in one meeting at prestigious @entity48 course @entity46 in 1996 , and has more than 500 group - level victories in his career so far			0
he is a household name in @entity9 , where one bookmaker announced odds of his chances of success in next year 's premier meetings immediately after the @entity6 authority 's decision was announced			1
@entity1 revealed in october that he will be ending his fulltime role at the @entity60 stable next year , and last month news broke about his positive test during a race meeting at the @entity65 course in @entity66			1
" @entity67 has been good to @entity1 and he knows that his privileged position brings with it responsibility , " @entity29 said			2
" for this reason he is determined to rebuild his reputation when he returns to the saddle			1
" @entity14 said @entity1 will have to undergo further drug testing from april 20 before he is allowed to return to racing			1
@entity29 said the three - time @entity9 champion , who has admitted taking weight - loss drugs in the past , is taking full responsibility for the failed test			2
" he is clear that the responsibility for his current situation lies squarely with him , " @entity29 said " from the start of @entity14 's inquiry he has acknowledged to them he has made a mistake and that the fault was his			2
" finally , he has asked me to thank everyone for the many messages of support he and his family have received			0
" the @entity9 professional @entity90 said it would support @entity1 's rehabilitation , but denied there was a widespread problem of drug use among its members			1
" from 2,607 in - competition urine tests and 3,697 breath tests since 2005 , there is no evidence to suggest that there is a fundamental drug problem with jockeys , " @entity98 chief executive @entity97 said			0
" 0.3 % of urine tests were positive for drugs and 0.2 % of both urine and breath tests were positive for alcohol			0
" the @entity98 said from 2005 - 11 it had recorded four positive tests for cocaine , one for cannabis and two for diuretics ( water shedding drugs ) -- both of which were for amateur riders			0
one alcohol positive was above the drink driving limit , and five were below			0
@entity97 said the @entity98 was aiming to raise awareness about the issue of jockeys ' mental wellbeing			0
" as well as all the normal pressures that other sportsmen and women have to contend with , unlike many other sports jockeys have the added pressures of massively reduced calorific intake and are constantly at very real risk of serious injury , " he said			0
" when it comes to mental wellbeing , racing perhaps lags behind other sports particularly when it comes to raising awareness of the issues and the support that is available , and it is overdue that more was done			0
