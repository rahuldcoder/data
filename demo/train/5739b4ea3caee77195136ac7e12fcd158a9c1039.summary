-- in 1907 , @entity1 banned corporate contributions to federal candidates in the wake of the robber baron - era scandals			0
in 1947 , the ban was formally applied to corporate expenditures and extended to cover labor unions			1
in 1974 , @entity1 enacted limits on individual contributions to federal candidates and political committees in the wake of the @entity15			0
in 2010 , the @entity17 @entity16 in the @entity19 case declared the corporate expenditure ban unconstitutional , holding that independent expenditures could not be constitutionally limited in federal elections , and implicitly that corporations could give unlimited amounts to other groups to spend , as long as the expenditures were made independently from the supported candidate			1
subsequently , the @entity28 in the @entity30 case held that the limits on individual contributions to groups that made independent expenditures were unconstitutional			0
thus was born the super pac			0
and thus was born the national campaign finance scandals that are unfolding daily in the 2012 elections			0
@entity37 are federally registered political action committees that raise unlimited contributions from the super rich , corporations , labor unions and other entities and spend these funds to make " independent " expenditures in federal elections			1
they are an unmitigated disaster for the @entity17 people			0
a recent study by @entity50 and the @entity17 @entity51 found that , as @entity55 reported , " @entity37 raised about $ 181 million in the last two years -- with roughly half of it coming from fewer than 200 super-rich people			1
" the study also found that 93 % of the itemized contributions raised by super pacs came in contributions of $ 10,000 or more , with more than half of this money coming from just 37 people who each gave $ 500,000 or more			1
@entity37 are a game for millionaires and billionaires			1
they are a game for corporations and other wealthy interests			0
meanwhile , citizens are pushed to the sidelines to watch the corruption of our democracy			1
in the 2012 presidential election , an even more insidious version of the super pac was born -- the candidate - specific super pac			1
every significant presidential campaign has had a super pac -- created and run by close associates of the candidate -- that raises unlimited contributions to spend only to support that presidential candidate			1
presidential candidate - specific super pacs are simply vehicles for the presidential candidates and their supporters to circumvent the limits on contributions to candidates enacted to prevent corruption			2
most of the super pac money has been spent on attack ads. we already have seen @entity96 and his wife give $ 10 million to the presidential super pac supporting @entity99			1
one couple ! $ 10 million ! the claim that these presidential super pacs are operating " independently " from the presidential candidates , as is required by law , is absurd and has no credibility			1
last week , president @entity106 reversed course and agreed to send @entity109 members , @entity112 staff and campaign officials to speak at and participate in fundraising events for @entity114 , the allegedly " independent " super pac supporting @entity106 's re-election			2
days later , @entity117 's campaign announced that senior @entity117 campaign aides would do the same and appear and speak at fundraising events for @entity120 , @entity117 's allegedly " independent " super pac			2
sound independent ? according to the @entity16 's view , a corporation that spends $ 30 million to elect a senator will not be able to buy corrupting influence over the senator 's positions because the corporation has not " coordinated " its expenditures with the senator			1
democracy 21 believes these super pacs are indeed engaging in illegally coordinated activities and is requesting the @entity133 to investigate			0
@entity37 corrupt our political system in two ways			2
first , super pacs allow a relatively few super-rich individuals and other wealthy interests to have greatly magnified and undue influence over the results of our elections			2
second , super pacs allow the super rich and wealthy interests to buy influence over government decisions , in the event the candidate wins			1
the @entity16 decision in the @entity19 case that unleashed this is built entirely on a fiction : that " independent " expenditures by corporations can not have a corrupting influence on federal officeholders			2
this is fantasy , not reality			0
important steps can and must be taken to deal with candidate - specific super pacs within the boundaries of the destructive @entity19 decision			2
rep. @entity163 , @entity164 , has introduced the @entity165 to close gaping loopholes in the disclosure laws			0
it requires super pacs immediately to disclose their donors and campaign expenditures , and requires the @entity37 ' top five donors , and the amounts they gave , to be listed on each of their ads. this legislation is essential to inform citizens about who is providing the money to influence their votes			1
in addition , @entity130 is preparing legislation to shut down super pacs that are closely tied to the candidate they are supporting			0
the legislation would treat these super pacs legally as arms of the candidate 's campaign and subject to the contribution limits that apply to the candidate			1
five @entity16 justices have done enormous damage to our country with one of the worst decisions in the history of the court			0
this will not be allowed to stand			0
citizens will rise up to demand and achieve fundamental reforms , as we have before when threatened with the systemic corruption of our government and officeholders			0
join the conversation on @entity211			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			0

@entity37 get unlimited funds from super rich , corporations , unions to spend in elections
@entity214 : @entity37 reportedly raised $ 181 million in two years , half from 200 people
@entity37 push citizens to sidelines , he says , by buying a candidate 's election
@entity37 must be required to disclose donors and expenditures , @entity214 says
