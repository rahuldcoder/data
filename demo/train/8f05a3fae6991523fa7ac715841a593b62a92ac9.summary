-- the stars may finally be aligning for a comprehensive immigration overhaul			1
whatever the reasons -- and there are many -- it 's about time			0
during my two terms as governor of a border state , there were times when i was hopeful for a breakthrough			2
but political fear - mongering often ruled the day as immigrants and drugs illegally crossed into the @entity16 and weapons flowed to the south			1
with every border flare - up , the @entity16 public -- and their elected leaders -- put immigration on the back burner			1
i am encouraged by the news that a bipartisan group of senators has crafted a plan and is working on building consensus toward a political way forward			2
the @entity31 is also taking an active role and showing leadership on this issue			0
my hope is that we end up with a truly comprehensive solution that does not tear families apart			2
opinion : worker visas are the key to immigration reform a comprehensive plan should create a path to earned citizenship , enforceable border security , a realistic guest worker plan , accountability for employers that hire illegal immigrants and passage of the @entity52			1
we have a window of opportunity now that did n't exist before because immigration is at a low point , and addressing the issue makes more sense politically			2
our struggle to recover from the financial crisis does n't just mean fewer jobs for @entity16 ; the lack of work has also deterred many would - be immigrants , especially those who come to @entity16 to find construction and manufacturing jobs			2
the @entity68 estimates that we have nearly 1 million fewer illegal immigrants living in @entity16 than we did in 2007			0
census officials say the economy is the primary reason for the decline			0
the aging population and the growing middle class in @entity76 may also be factors that explain the new trend			0
while nobody is celebrating the poor economy and the lack of jobs , the reality that illegal immigration is n't seen as a " crisis " at the moment , gives us the opportunity to have a reasoned debate , without the unnecessary rhetoric , and finally enact a comprehensive immigration plan			1
with a stable and reasonable immigration system in place , i believe we 'll have more opportunities for bilateral economic growth and trade between the @entity16 and @entity76			0
that will mean more jobs on both sides of the border			0
politically , the results of the recent election strongly suggest this is the moment for reform			0
first , president @entity105 is following through on his promise to make an immigration overhaul a priority , using the good will he earned with the @entity111 constituencies , and will announce his proposals tuesday			1
second , many @entity113 in @entity114 realize that they need a new political strategy if they have any hope of bouncing back from the devastating losses they are experiencing with @entity111 voters			1
@entity120 : under deportation , above fear hispanics of all ethnic backgrounds are embracing @entity125 candidates and their message of inclusiveness and opportunity for all			0
opposition to immigration overhaul , including the demonization of foreign - born families that look to @entity16 for opportunity , is hurting republicans at the polls			1
third , the @entity137 ruled emphatically that immigration is the responsibility of the federal government , not the states			0
while i am certainly sympathetic as a former governor with the issues that states must deal with as a result of illegal immigration , the onus is on @entity114 to pass an immigration plan			1
unless we come to grips with all aspects of the immigration issue , we are going to end up with the same impractical , expensive and ineffective solutions we have had for years			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .			1

until now , fear - mongering drove immigration policy and overhaul was ignored
@entity157 : with illegal immigration down , @entity113 realizes it needs to address @entity111
he says we need path to citizenship , border security , guest worker plan , @entity52
@entity157 : the onus is on @entity114 to pass a comprehensive immigration plan
