-- like all online businesses , the marketing industry is being radically changed by the creeping ubiquity of mobile devices			1
this shift to the smaller screen will inevitably have profound implications on both global marketing companies like @entity9 and @entity10 as well as on @entity12 companies like @entity13 and @entity14 whose revenue is mostly derived from online advertising			2
it was no surprise , therefore , that one of the major themes his weekend at @entity20 , the annual @entity9 " unconference " about digital advertising and marketing , was the growing importance of mobile			2
held each september in the delightful @entity29 seaside resort of @entity30 , @entity20 is distinguished by the audience - generated content from the 400 entrepreneurs , and advertising and marketing executives invited to the event			2
talks by participants this year at @entity20 thus had titles like " monetizing social discussion , " " banners are dead , " " mobile payments at scale , " " who will own your mobile wallet " and " unlocking $ 50 billion in digital brand spend			0
" yet for all the talk about mobile , @entity20 was , in part , characterized by a deep uncertainty about its impact on the industry			1
as sir @entity54 , @entity9 's long - time ceo , said in response to a question about whether @entity14 can successfully monetize mobile technology : " we do n't know the answer			1
" but i had a simpler question for the @entity20 attendees that i met in @entity30 over the weekend			0
is it possible , i asked , that the digital marketing industry could be destroyed by mobile ? could the shift to smaller screens actually kill online marketing ? " the small screen will disrupt but not kill the advertising industry , " @entity68 , a serial @entity69 internet entrepreneur and a regular @entity20 attendee , explained to me			1
but that disruption , many people at @entity20 acknowledge , will be deeply challenging			0
it 's a challenge , @entity76 chief revenue officer @entity75 told me , is to " create big moments on a small screen			1
" @entity75 describes himself as an " inventor of new ad models in mobile			0
" but those new ad models being developed by @entity75 at @entity76 are still , at best , in their infancy			0
and as @entity86 , the global director of analytics at the pr agency @entity88 , told me , mobile will only successfully monetized when the advertising industry understand that mobile is n't just a smaller screen version of traditional internet media			1
" we need to rethink advertising , " @entity86 insists			2
we need to think about it , she says , as a personal service to mobile users			0
many @entity20 attendees agreed with @entity86 that both the challenge and opportunity of mobile lies with its intensely personalized nature			1
" the days of dumb advertising are over , " @entity104 , the president and ceo of the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) told me over breakfast at @entity20			0
@entity75 's " big moments " must then , in fact , be big " personal " moments if the marketing industry is to successful transition to mobile media			1
perhaps the best description of the challenge was expressed to me in @entity30 by the legendary investor and @entity9 board member @entity119 , who said that the advertising industry needed to " deliver value rather than just describing value			1
" because we look at our mobile devices all the time , @entity124 told me , this media should be " every advertisers dream			1
" but the industry needs to learn to create useful products to consumers , such as @entity134 airline 's bag tracking app , rather than just gratuitously impersonal advertising			0
mobile advertisers , @entity124 explained , need to distinguish between media as a mirror and a painting			1
in the old days of television or desktop internet advertising , advertising was like a painting that we could all admire without seeing ourselves			0
but today , @entity124 says , advertising has a mirror with personalized information unique to us if we are to pay for information or products			0
@entity86 sees three promising models for a mobile marketers and advertisers			1
the first is way in which @entity155 is enabling consumers to scan products in stores with their mobile devices to get their online price			0
the second is @entity162 initiative to enable their customers to pay for their coffee via mobiles			0
and the third is the geo - targeted and content - targeted advertising that @entity168 has developed specifically for mobile devices			2
no event like @entity20 would , of course , be complete without the radical optimists -- the " unlocking $ 50 billion in digital brand spend " crowd - who believe that mobile will trigger a unique cornucopia of opportunities for the advertising industry			1
but , as the @entity107 's @entity104 told me , the funny thing about the advertising industry is its constancy			0
from 1917 onwards , he explained , advertising has always made up around 2 % of @entity69 gdp			2
so , while - to borrow some words of wisdom from @entity9 's @entity54 - " we do n't know the answer " to how exactly the small screen revolution will change advertising , mobile probably wo n't radically alter the size of the industry			1
the more things change then , the more they stay the same			0
which is why it is probably appropriate that @entity20 is held each year in @entity30 - the little town outside @entity198 that knows all about the unchanging and challenging nature of the long distance race .			2

@entity202 is changing the face of marketing but no one is sure what the long - term impact will be
@entity69 entrepreneur @entity68 says small screen will disrupt , but not kill the industry
but pr agency director @entity86 says the industry still does n't get mobile media
mobile advertisers need to deliver value , not just describe it , says investor @entity119
