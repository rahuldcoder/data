-- @entity1 approved the use of military force in @entity4 on saturday , despite warnings of consequences from the @entity7 , and @entity4 responded by saying any invasion into its territory would be illegitimate			1
the acting prime minister has gone so far as to say that a @entity1 invasion would mean war and an end to his country 's relationship with @entity1			1
but there are so many questions as to how @entity4 arrived at this point : why is @entity1 so interested in happenings there ? why does the @entity7 want to prevent @entity1 intervention ? how did we get here ? why have thousands of protesters staked their lives , seemingly , on their desire for political change ? and why has the government resisted their calls so vehemently ? let 's take a look : 1			1
why has @entity1 gotten so involved ? @entity4 and the @entity31 have closer ties to @entity1 , while @entity33 is more friendly with @entity34			1
many eastern @entity35 still speak @entity1 , and the 2010 presidential elections divided the country with @entity4 voting heavily in favor of @entity40 prime minister @entity39			1
on saturday , the @entity41 issued a statement that @entity1 president @entity43 told @entity45 president @entity44 that @entity1 approved military action in @entity4 because it " reserves the right to defend its interests and the @entity1 - speaking people who live there			1
has n't @entity39 stepped down ? the @entity4 @entity50 voted him out of power and he has fled to @entity1			1
however , in a press conference friday , the former president said -- in @entity1 rather than @entity35 -- that he was not overthrown			1
he insisted he was still the boss and that he wants nothing more than to lead his country to peace , harmony and prosperity			0
while it 's unclear if he could return to power , @entity1 's ambassador to the @entity60 blamed members of the @entity64 for the bloody demonstrations that led to @entity39 's ouster			1
what will happen in @entity4 if @entity1 sends troops there ? top @entity35 officials , including the acting president and prime minister , have said they are prepared to defend the country			1
they 've also said that any invasion would be illegitimate , a response echoed by the @entity45 , which has told @entity1 to respect @entity4 's sovereignty			1
would there be international backlash to a @entity1 incursion ? the @entity60 has warned @entity1 against military action , while @entity80 ban ki - moon told @entity43 " dialogue must be the only tool in ending the crisis			1
" international leaders have also denounced the prospect of @entity1 involvement , while @entity44 has warned there would be consequences if @entity1 acted militarily			1
what sort of consequences ? @entity44 has n't been specific other than to say @entity1 could face " greater political and economic isolation " and that the @entity45 " will suspend upcoming participation in preparatory meetings for the @entity93 " in @entity94			1
several @entity96 leaders in @entity97 have called on the president to take a tougher stand			2
what are @entity44 's options ? sanctions , of course , top the list of options , but the @entity45 will need to prepare for the backlash			2
former presidential adviser @entity107 says @entity43 would consider any sanctions " small potatoes " compared to keeping control of @entity31 , while @entity43 could pull his support for @entity44 's initiative to reduce nuclear threats in the world , including in @entity115			2
@entity116 , former @entity45 ambassador to @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 , says imposing sanctions also raises the risk of alienating a superpower			0
" that means 20 years of trying to work with @entity1 down the drain , " he said			2
what started the turmoil in @entity4 ? protests initially erupted over a trade pact			1
for a year , @entity39 insisted he was intent on signing a historical political and trade agreement with the @entity64			1
but on november 21 , he decided to suspend talks with the @entity64			1
what would the pact have done ? the deal , the @entity64 's " @entity133 , " would have created closer political ties and generated economic growth			1
it would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion , supporters of the pact said			2
why did @entity39 backpedal ? he had his reasons			0
chief among them was @entity1 's opposition to it			1
@entity1 threatened its much smaller neighbor with trade sanctions and steep gas bills if @entity4 forged ahead			1
if @entity4 did n't , and instead joined a @entity151 - led @entity150 , it would get deep discounts on natural gas , @entity1 said			1
were there any other reasons ? yes , a more personal one			0
@entity39 also was facing a key @entity64 demand that he was unwilling to meet : free former prime minister @entity157 , his bitter political opponent			2
two years ago , she was found guilty of abuse of office in a @entity1 gas deal and sentenced to seven years in prison , in a case widely seen as politically motivated			2
her supporters say she needs to travel abroad for medical treatment			0
what happened next ? many @entity35 were outraged			0
they took to the streets , demanding that @entity39 sign the @entity64 deal			1
the demonstrations drew parallels to @entity4 's 2004 @entity173 , which booted @entity39 , then a prime minister , from office			1
who 's heading the opposition ? it 's not just one figure , but a coalition			2
the best known figure is @entity182			0
he 's a former world champion boxer ( just like his brother @entity183 )			2
@entity182 heads the @entity185 party			0
but the opposition bloc goes well beyond @entity182 and the @entity185			0
how did @entity39 react ? in a way that inflamed passions further			0
he flew to @entity151 , where he and @entity1 president @entity43 announced @entity1 would buy $ 15 billion in @entity35 debt and slash the price @entity193 pays for its gas			2
and then , when the demonstrations showed no signs of dying down , he adopted a sweeping anti-protest law			0
what did the anti-protest law say ? the law barred people from wearing helmets and masks to rallies and from setting up tents or sound equipment without prior police permission			0
this sparked concerns it could be used to put down demonstrations and deny people the right to free speech -- and clashes soon escalated			0
the demonstrators took over @entity218 for the better part of three months			0
but was n't the law repealed ? yes , ultimately it was			0
amid intense pressure , deputies loyal to @entity39 backtracked and overturned it			0
but by then , the protests had become about something much bigger : constitutional reform			2
what change in the constitution did they want to see ? the protesters want to see a change in the government 's overall power structure			2
they feel that too much power rests with @entity39 and not enough with parliament			0
what did the government do ? in late january , the president offered a package of concessions under which @entity188 , the opposition leader , would have become the prime minister and , under the president 's offer , been able to dismiss the government			1
he also offered @entity182 the post of deputy prime minister on humanitarian issues			0
he also agreed to a working group looking at changes to the constitution			0
why did the opposition pass on the offer ? the concessions were n't enough to satisfy them			0
they said @entity39 had hardly loosened his grip on the government , nor had he seemingly reined in authorities ' approach to protesters			0
" we 're finishing what we started , " @entity188 said			0
who was to blame for the clashes ? depends on whom you ask			0
the government pointed the finger at protesters			0
the opposition , in turn , blamed the government			0
what 's the takeaway here ? street protests that started in november over a trade pact swelled into something much bigger -- resulting in the former president fleeing to @entity1 for safety while still claiming to be the official leader of the country			1
with @entity1 troops rumored to be preparing for hostilities in the @entity31 , the future of the region and the resulting effect on @entity45 - @entity1 relations appears shaky			2
@entity0 's @entity291 and @entity292 contributed to this report			0

@entity7 threatens consequences as @entity1 approves military action in @entity4
@entity4 has been *rattled* by *anti-government* protests since november
the trigger then was the president 's decision not to sign a trade pact with the @entity64
@entity4 is split : some want to align more with the @entity7 , others favor @entity1
