-- costume designer @entity1 can create eras with fabric			1
for " @entity5 " and " blow , " he evoked the 1970s			2
" @entity6 " showcased the early ' 90s			0
" @entity7 " went back to gritty early 20th century @entity8 , and " @entity9 , " " @entity10 " and " @entity11 " offered a range of contemporary looks befitting their locales -- and characters			0
with " @entity16 , " a black - and - white silent film , @entity1 brings back that golden @entity19 age -- both the peak of its glamour and pit of its shabbiness			1
he earned an @entity26 nomination for his work -- his first , perhaps surprising given his work on some of the most notable films of the past 15 years			1
he spoke with @entity0 about how his job combines the best of all worlds , and what ( or " who , " for those who prefer the favored @entity26 pre-show word ) he 'll be wearing on the red carpet			1
the following has been edited and condensed from the original transcript			0
@entity0 : i understand you have a fondness for silent - era pictures			1
@entity1 : ever since i was young			1
i have book reports from when i was in fifth grade or seventh grade on silent movies			1
my mother used to take us to revival houses because i was interested in it , so it 's always been a lifelong interest of mine			0
and it combines with my vocation , and i was really , really excited with the possibility of doing this film			0
@entity0 : how did you go about getting the look of the time ? bridges : without the color to communicate the language of telling the story , i was trying to tell the story through textures , whether it be @entity69 © , sequins and beads for @entity19 , or very flat rough textured wools to communicate down - on - your - heels , or the elegance of satin lapels for evening wear , or the shimmer of a beautiful nightgown			1
it became a story of textures telling the story			1
@entity0 : how did working with director @entity83 compare with working with @entity84 ( who directed " @entity5 , " " @entity7 " and " @entity10 " ) or @entity85 ( who directed " @entity6 " ) ? bridges : i do n't see any difference , because my position remains the same : they give me the material , and i propose a way to contribute to the visuals of the story			2
same thing when i read one of @entity84 's original scripts			0
i read it , we discuss it , then i go out and try to figure out what language of clothing are we making this story			2
it 's always about how do i reveal this character , how do i reveal this moment through the character 's external appearance			0
@entity0 : actors say that it 's getting into costume that allows them to become another person			2
it 's like a personality change			0
bridges : it 's interesting when that happens in a fitting room			0
we start out with me and an actor , and then with the right combination of clothes or a talk about how a moment might be played or illustrated , suddenly there 's this third person there who was n't there when we started , and then we know we 're on to something			0
@entity0 : how did you get into the business ? bridges : i was always involved in theater and drama			0
as a child , i loved movies , i always drew , i always loved fabric , i loved clothes , i loved color , i loved telling a story			2
so it 's an amalgam of everything i enjoy , and it happens to be called costume designer			1
@entity0 : what are you going to wear ? bridges : i 'm going to wear a single - breasted , peak - lapel @entity147 tuxedo , which is very throwback to the period , and a custom tuxedo shirt from @entity152 of @entity153 .			2
