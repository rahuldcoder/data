-- @entity2 's early own goal gave @entity3 a historic first win at @entity5 on tuesday and left @entity6 in danger of finishing outside the top eight in the @entity10 top flight for the first time since 1954			1
with saturday 's @entity15 final against @entity16 in mind , @entity13 manager @entity12 rested a host of first - choice players , including @entity20 , @entity21 and goalkeeper @entity22			0
the home side made the worst possible start when @entity2 headed in former @entity6 defender @entity26 's cross , and could n't recover against a @entity3 team that had won only three previous away games this season			2
the @entity31 club moved level on points with eighth - placed @entity6 , while @entity34 edged closer to finishing above their @entity36 rivals for the first time in seven years with a 1 - 1 draw at @entity40			1
an own goal by @entity40 striker @entity42 -- the 1,000th goal of this @entity45 season -- gave @entity34 the lead after 44 minutes before fellow forward @entity47 came off the bench to snatch a point in the 69th minute			0
@entity34 lost to @entity6 in the @entity15 semifinals , but the draw left @entity53 ' side three points above the @entity13 with two league games to play			2
@entity6 were booed off by their home fans , having won three of the last 13 league games and only five times at home in the @entity45 all season			0
" our attitude was n't right , and if you go in with a bad attitude you 're going to get a bad performance , " said @entity12 , whose team won the @entity64 in february			0
in @entity69 on tuesday , @entity68 secured a vital 3 - 2 win at @entity71 that moved them closer to safety and all but condemned the opposition to the second division			1
@entity77 put the visitors 2 - 1 up from the penalty spot just before half time and @entity81 added a third in the 56th minute before a late consolation from @entity83			2
the end of the game was marred by the home fans throwing objects onto the pitch as they saw their team slump to a loss that leaves them needing to win their last two games and hope @entity93 lose both theirs			0
@entity68 will be safe if @entity94 do not beat @entity95 on wednesday , as will @entity96 who beat @entity98 2 - 1 thanks to a first - half double by @entity101 striker @entity100			1
@entity102 could only draw 1 - 1 at home to relegated @entity104 to damage their chances of qualifying for the @entity106			1
in @entity108 , @entity107 seem destined to miss out on @entity110 qualification after playing out a 0 - 0 draw in torrential rain at @entity113			1
if they are to finish third , @entity107 need to win their last two games and hope neither @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 nor @entity117 take more than three points from their final three matches .			0

@entity3 beat @entity6 1 - 0 for the first ever win at @entity5
@entity34 draw 1 - 1 at @entity40 to move three points clear of @entity6
@entity68 edge closer to safety in @entity126 with 3 - 2 win over @entity71
@entity107 's @entity110 hopes suffer after 0 - 0 draw at @entity113 in @entity108
