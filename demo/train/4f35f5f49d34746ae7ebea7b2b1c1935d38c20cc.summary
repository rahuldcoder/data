@entity1 , @entity0 -- a historical society in @entity0 , where slavery began in the @entity7 colonies in 1619 , has discovered the identities of 3,200 slaves from unpublished private documents , providing new information for today 's descendants in a first - of - its - kind online database , society officials say			1
many of the slaves had been forgotten to the world until the @entity17 received a $ 100,000 grant to pore over some of its 8 million unpublished manuscripts -- letters , diaries , ledgers , books and farm documents from @entity26 dating to the 1600s -- and began discovering the long - lost identities of the slaves , said society president and ceo @entity31			1
the private , nonprofit historical society , the fourth - oldest in the nation , is assembling a growing roster of slaves ' names and other information , such as the slaves ' occupations , locations and plantation owners ' names , said @entity31			1
the free , public website also provides a high - resolution copy of the antique documents that identify the slave			1
the database , which went online last september with 1,500 names , sets itself apart from the few other existing slave databases -- which limit themselves to specific plantations or to ship manifests that list the captives by their native @entity55 names , society officials said			1
the " unknown no longer : a database of @entity60 " website is the first online resource listing slaves ' names across all of slaveholding @entity0 , the nation 's oldest state which had the largest enslaved population , numbering a half million people , at the outbreak of the @entity69 in 1861 , society officials said			1
" most slaves were by their owners ' design and eventually by law forbidden to learn how to read and write , so they did n't leave us material that so many figures in the past did , " @entity31 said			2
" that 's when you have to be creative			2
" so using a $ 100,000 corporate grant from @entity83 , one of the nation 's largest producers and transporters of energy , society researchers began examining some of its 8 million manuscripts that @entity0 residents have been giving to the historical society since its founding in 1831			1
those @entity0 families found the old , handwritten papers in attics , basements or desk drawers , @entity31 said			1
the society stores the documents in an archive spanning thousands of square feet , he said			1
the antique papers turned out to mention slaves			2
" often they appeared in the records of the owners who owned slaves as human property , which to us sounds so obscene and alien , " said @entity31 , who 's also a historian			1
" but these people were writing down their inventory as if you would for insurance purposes			0
that 's the kind of things that owners did with slaves			1
this was the most valuable property they owned , and they wanted to make sure it was recorded			0
" often there was a human connection , and they grew up with these people , and they recorded their birth dates and deaths			0
it 's an incredibly complicated and tragic institution that we 're just beginning to understand the dimensions of , " @entity31 said			2
documents citing slaves go back to the 1690s : " that 's when slavery starts to grow fast in @entity0 and other @entity141 colonies , " @entity31 said			1
" sometimes it 's a real detective work			2
you have to read between the lines : oh , they mention @entity146 in a letter , and then you have to read another letter in the collection to realize that @entity146 is a slave and not a family member , " @entity31 said			2
the society saturday held the first of four community workshops on how to use the online database at the organization 's headquarters in @entity1 , @entity0			1
while the online website is intuitive on how to use , the workshops are being held for users who need more guidance , @entity31 said			0
some 80 people came to saturday 's workshop , including @entity163 , a high school history teacher who flew in from @entity164 , @entity165 for the event			2
@entity163 said the original documents digitized on the site will help her uncover more of her own family 's history in @entity0 , as well as help her students learn about the era			1
" i 'm going to use this not only personally , but professionally , " she said			0
it 's a model and i hope the rest of the states catch up real quickly			2
" amateur genealogist @entity179 of @entity1 said she hopes the sites will help her trace her roots back to the 1800s			0
" i need to know my history , " she said , adding the site may help her prove or disprove many of the things she 's heard about her family 's past			2
" i wanted to really know			0
i wanted to be able to see and connect the dots			0
" when the @entity7 banned the importation of slaves after 1807 , @entity0 became the largest provider in the nation 's internal slave trade , @entity31 said			1
slavery was eventually abolished at the conclusion of the @entity69 in 1865			0
that means many @entity7 families with slave ancestors could have roots in @entity0 , @entity31 said			0
" @entity195 in @entity0 is not just a @entity0 story			0
it reaches across all of the slave @entity204 , " @entity31 said			0
" so you may not know you have @entity0 ancestors , but you could			0
" the database features a public message board , filled with notes posted by users searching for ancestors who may have been slaves			1
the advanced search fields include the slave 's first name or last name ; gender ; occupation ; owner 's last name ; date range ; and record type			1
one user named " @entity223 " wrote last september : " well , i think i found the slave owner that owned my great , great , great grandfather but that is as far as i got			1
nothing on my great grandfather and great grandmother who lived in @entity231 , @entity0 this was good for me , however			1
" elsewhere in the database is a stark description of the sale of slaves and goods in a february 11 , 1858 , typed letter from slaveholder @entity240 of " @entity241 " in @entity242 , @entity0 , to his wife , @entity243			1
" the corn we sold yesterday brought 3.15 $ per barrel			2
we sold all the negros 43 in number at astonishingly large prices -- the whole amounting to $ 32016			1
nearly every one of the negros were satisfied as they were bought by people in the country mostly , going ahead of the prices given by the traders , " @entity243 wrote his wife			1
the letter continued : " @entity258 and three children brought $ 2795			2
and @entity260 and three children $ 2505			0
my father gave $ 25			0
to mr. @entity264 and then allowed mr. @entity265 to take @entity260 as he owned her husband			0
old mr. @entity265 bought @entity258 and children			0
@entity258 's husband exclaimed just as she was knocked out to his master " glory to @entity272 on high , peace and good will to men on earth " and it seemed to pop from his very soul			0
and was bought for @entity279 of @entity280			0
" @entity281 , who attended saturday 's workshop , said he 's been researching his family for the past 15 years , but finding information about his ancestors was n't easy			0
he 's hoping his 12 grandchildren can benefit from his work			0
" researching black folk is difficult , so anytime you can find a new resource it 's always good to investigate , " he said			0
" it 's a database for the ones that are coming up			1
they 'll be able to take it and grow from that			0
" @entity2 's @entity296 reported from @entity1 , @entity0 and @entity297 contributed from @entity298 .			0

the @entity17 finds 3,200 slaves named in private documents
the unpublished documents are from @entity26 ' attics , basements and desk drawers
" we sold all the negros 43 in number at astonishingly large prices , " an 1858 letter says
one user of the society 's free database of slaves finds the owner of his great - great - great - grandfather
