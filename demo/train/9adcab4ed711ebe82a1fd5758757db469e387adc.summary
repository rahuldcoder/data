@entity1 , @entity0 -- it was the stench			0
that was what really hit @entity6 the first time he went into a slum in @entity9			1
in " @entity11 " a poor man wins a place on @entity9 's version of " @entity14 ? " " there 's this smell you get first of all , " recalls the @entity16 director			1
" this incredible mixture of our excrement -- it belongs to all of us -- and then saffron			0
it 's just this mixture of sweet and sour			2
" @entity6 's experiences shooting in the teeming , chaotic port city of @entity25 could also be described as sweet and sour			1
the director , who is renown for films like " @entity31 " and " @entity32 , " had never even been to @entity9 before he and his crew traveled there to make the critically acclaimed @entity35 contender " @entity11			1
" " it 's pretty mad , " admits @entity6			1
it 's too hot , the tea is too sweet ; everything is kind of too much			2
" but , he adds : " that 's wonderful for drama , absolutely wonderful			2
" he and his crew threw themselves into shooting their drama in the streets and landmarks of @entity9 's " city of dreams " using passers - by as extras			1
they also shot in the @entity54 -- @entity56 's largest slum -- and @entity58 slum which can be seen from the city 's airport			1
" @entity11 " is a classic rags - to - riches story about a young boy from the slums , @entity64 ( played by @entity16 actor @entity65 ) , who beats millions of other @entity9 to bag a coveted place on the country 's version of tv game show " @entity14 ? " through the timely story of the young " slumdog , " @entity6 illuminates the contradictions of present day @entity9 -- the nuclear power that does not provide public sanitation for its population -- and @entity25 was the ideal city in which to do it			1
" @entity25 is a city of extremes , " @entity6 explains , " life is raw			1
it 's incredibly powerful and rich because their economy is expanding , the richest men in the world are there ... but then there is also this enormous poverty as well			0
" do you think @entity6 has captured @entity9 in " @entity11 " ? tell us below in the @entity89 box			1
@entity6 's film shows these extremes with great realism			1
he takes the audience from the cheerfully money - grubbing micro-commerce of the slums where young boys charge slum dwellers to use filthy latrines , to @entity64 's job as a " chaiwallah " ( tea boy ) in one of @entity9 's much - publicized call centers , and later , to the @entity9 game show phenomenon , " @entity93			1
" @entity6 achieved this realism by immersing himself , his crew and actors in the @entity25 sprawl , and shooting as much as possible in real locations			1
" i wanted to feel really involved in the city			0
i did n't want to be looking at it , examining it			0
i wanted to be thrown into the chaos as much as possible			0
" there 's a period of time between about 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. where it all stops and just the dogs move around , but other than that , the place is just a tide of humanity			0
" with limited time in @entity9 , @entity6 made the decision to travel to the places he intended to shoot and film the cast 's rehearsals there			1
this was something the film 's star , @entity65 , found challenging at first			2
" it 's daunting at first doing these scenes outdoors with loads of people watching , but they just warm to it and everybody is , like , laughing and they start clapping at the end of the scenes , " @entity65 laughs			0
his co-star @entity144 , who plays love interest @entity145 , was born and brought up in @entity25 and knows the city well			2
watch @entity65 and @entity144 talking about the making of " @entity11			2
" " you ca n't stop the bystanders in @entity25 , " she explains , " it is something that you attract anyway , especially if you have a camera out there and a foreign crew and a song and dance			2
" you are definitely going to attract a huge crowd and you ca n't do anything about it			0
the only thing you can do is enjoy it			0
" for @entity6 and the crew , on the other side of the camera , the energy and chaos was a pretty intense experience			1
" you just do n't have any control in @entity9 , " he explains			2
" if you seek it , it will drive you insane			0
you 've got to go with it really and just see what happens			0
" but they did have some tricks up their collective sleeve			0
@entity6 and veteran cinematographer @entity178 shot crowd scenes , like the chase through @entity181 at the beginning of the film , using the people who happened to be passing by on the street for added realism			1
they wanted to draw as little attention to themselves as possible to keep the crowds looking natural			0
to achieve this feeling of being right in the middle of everything without disturbing the local communities too much , they used a variety of small digital cameras and digital stills camera			0
" [ we used ] a @entity201 stills camera , which takes 12 frames per second			0
if people see a stills camera , they do n't think it 's recording live action , " he explains			0
for @entity6 , who believes his first film , " @entity210 " ( 1995 ) is still his best , because " you have n't a clue what you are doing " and " you have n't learnt the tricks yet , " he says , shooting in @entity25 was a way of recapturing that early originality			1
" you arrive and you feel a bit vulnerable and naked again , and that 's a really good thing , because you are not tempted to just step in your own footsteps all the time			0

@entity6 had never been to @entity9 before shooting " @entity11 "
the @entity16 director shot the film in the streets and slums using passers - by as extras
@entity6 on shooting in @entity25 : " it 's pretty mad . everything is extreme . "
" @entity11 " has been critically acclaimed and is hotly tipped for @entity35
