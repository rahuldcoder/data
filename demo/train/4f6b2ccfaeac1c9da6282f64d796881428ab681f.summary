-- on friday march 11 , @entity2 's @entity1 will become available for purchase online and in retail stores			1
early trade - in activity surrounding the original @entity1 suggests that that the @entity1 will be in high demand			2
as with last year 's original @entity1 and the @entity8 , we anticipate crowds and long lines at various @entity2 retail stores across the @entity12			1
are you interested in buying an @entity1 2 this weekend ? here 's what you need to know			1
online or in - store with the original @entity1 and the @entity8 , @entity2 allowed individuals to place pre-orders online or to reserve a device for in - store pickup			1
with @entity1 2 , @entity2 is eschewing the pre-order game			1
instead , the @entity1 will be available via @entity2 at some point early friday , and in retail stores starting at 5:00pm			1
online reports indicate that @entity2 sales will start at 12:01am pst on march 11 , 2011			1
@entity27 buyers , set your clocks for 3am			0
at @entity2 , users can choose between white or black variants in @entity32 or @entity32 + @entity33			2
users can select either @entity35 or @entity36 for their @entity32 + @entity37			0
@entity2 promises " fast , free shipping , " which indicates they are using 2 - day @entity39 or @entity40			2
depending on when an order goes through , it 's possible users could get units on monday march 14 , 2011			2
we 'll be realistic and expect that most users who place an order on friday will receive their packages on tuesday march 15 , 2011			0
like @entity50 , you 'll need to watch for the @entity51			0
@entity2 retail stores will begin selling the @entity1 2 at 5:00pm			1
typically , @entity2 shuts down its stores for a few hours prior to launch in order to get signage , inventory and staff in place			2
lines may start at some outdoor @entity2 stores as early as friday morning ( if not thursday night ) , but indoor mall locations may start later , depending on mall policies and general shopping traffic			2
retail partners in addition to the @entity2 retail stores , the ipad 2 will also be available at @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			1
@entity72 will also be selling the @entity1 2 on friday march 11 , 2011			1
none of the retail launch partners have specified if sales will take place both in - store and online , but we expect that in - store sales will not begin until 5:00pm			0
it is n't clear if @entity36 will be carrying the @entity1 2 at launch ( we 've reached out to them for comment ) , but 3g variants from both carriers should be available at retail partners like @entity70 and @entity68			1
neither @entity36 nor @entity35 will be carrying the @entity32 only models			0
models , colors , carriers there are eighteen different @entity1 2 units : the nine listed below , available in either black or white			1
-- @entity1 2 @entity94 : $ 499.00 -- @entity1 2 @entity95 : $ 599.00 -- @entity1 2 @entity96 : $ 699.00 -- @entity1 2 @entity94 +3g @entity35 : $ 629.00 -- @entity1 2 @entity95 +3g @entity35 : $ 729.00 -- @entity1 2 @entity96 +3g @entity35 : $ 829.00 -- @entity1 2 @entity94 +3g @entity36 : $ 629.00 -- @entity1 2 @entity95 +3g @entity36 : $ 729.00 -- @entity1 2 @entity96 +3g @entity36 : $ 829.00 unlike the white @entity8 debacle , @entity2 promises that white ipad 2 units will be available on launch day			1
it 's really anyone 's guess as to the breakdown between color choices			0
@entity2 retail stores will likely have the most white units in - stock , with retailers like @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 carrying mostly black units			1
tips from @entity112 veterans having covered -- and waited in -- numerous @entity114 in the past , these are my suggestions : -- @entity68 , @entity69 or @entity70 stores near an @entity2 retail store are likely to be less crowded			2
customers who want the fastest purchase experience should check the retail locations closest to the @entity121			0
-- if you have a color / size preference , order online			0
waiting in line for a few hours only to find out that the model you want is out of stock is no fun			0
if you want a specific color / capacity , reduce your stress level and order online			0
-- plan for @entity132 shoppers			0
wireless stores get pretty busy on friday nights even without the ipad 2 -- keep that in mind before heading to the local @entity35 or @entity36 store			1
-- avoid the @entity140 - area @entity2 stores			2
@entity141 coincides with the @entity1 launch , meaning thousands of geeks will be in town and may descend on the store			0
locals and visitors alike should steer clear			0
just thinking about it makes me queasy			0
-- check @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 for line reports and information on how busy particular locations are			0
it is n't uncommon for stores like @entity68 and @entity70 to get friday deliveries			0
we imagine that at least some ipad 2 inventory will be delivered for the weekend , which means that saturday mornings are a good time to try local stores -- and if you 're brave -- the @entity121			1

@entity2 's @entity1 will become available for purchase on march 11 online and in stores
with @entity1 2 , @entity2 is eschewing the pre-order game
