-- a @entity2 player embarrassed himself monday with his crazy decision to use his head the wrong way and he got panned for the way he lashed out at an opponent			1
that , and @entity2 's play in a humbling 4 - 0 loss , were two of the lowlights on the fifth day of play in @entity14			1
as was a 0 - 0 draw that produced very little excitement			0
but then there was the stunning goal by a @entity20 player whose inclusion in the game was a surprise to many			2
here are a few of the day 's big developments			2
that 's not nice @entity27 , @entity27 , @entity27			1
bad boy ! it is generally frowned upon to headbutt anyone , anytime -- unless it 's @entity32 ! but if you 're gon na do it -- and again , shame on you for thinking about it -- at least do it right			1
that 's not us , that @entity39 , who slammed the @entity41 player after he tapped @entity43 forward @entity42 in monday 's match with the crown of his head			0
" the only man that can pull of a headbutt with class is @entity59 , " wrote @ @entity47 , referring to the memorable 2006 @entity49 incident in which the @entity51 great slammed his head into the chest of an @entity54 player			0
" i 'll rate that headbutt 1 # zidane out of 5 # @entity63 # @entity64 , " said @ @entity60			0
" calling that a head - butt by @entity27 is an insult to @entity59 ...			2
. and ( boxer @entity67 ) @entity68 , " wrote â €			0
