while many of you may breeze out your office door , throwing around claims like " i 'm leaving my laptop at home ! " " no cellphone on this trip ! " and " i might just stay and become @entity22 ! " it 's highly unlikely that you 're going to completely divorce yourself from the technological realm the minute you pull on your fanny pack			1
why ? well , with the rise of the smartphone and the growing ubiquity of in - flight @entity31 , we 're about as addicted to tech as your average hipster is to heartache and broken dreams ( read : very )			2
case in point : according to research from @entity38 and @entity39 , 72 percent of people in the @entity42 check e-mail during their time off			2
although we 're not advocating logging in to @entity45 or entourage while sunning on @entity47 ( that 's just indicative of a bleak , coffee - stained future ) , we 're all for staying at least a little plugged - in whilst unplugging			1
just remember , there 's a fine line between sharing your vacation with your associates at home and becoming that annoyingly tan , infuriatingly - drunk - at - 3 - p.m. layabout who texts pictures of sun - drenched beaches to her cubicle - shackled friends			1
read on for three ways to keep your clock - punching compatriots abreast of your holiday goings - on -- without making them want to leap down the elevator shaft			0
share snaps wisely remember the good old days when , after a vacation , @entity67 would get out the projector and invite the neighbors over for a @entity72 mold , cocktails and an endless parade of awkward photos of you and your sister blinking into the sun in front of the @entity81 ? well , we 've moved past the days of such outmoded projectors ( unless it 's a bad - ass @entity85 and you 're screening " @entity90 " while trying to seduce that cinephile chick you picked up at the indie film fest last week ) , and we really should move past the practice of photographic torture			1
to facebook as soon as you get home , take your time selecting the most interesting and relevant shots			0
we 're assuming that since you 're putting your photos online , you want people to look at them , and no one wants to look at 15 identical pictures -- sans captions -- of your aunt standing in front of the @entity106 with her arm around the dude dressed as @entity109			0
also , now that @entity110 has launched drag - and - drop functionality , making it easy to reorder you albums , you have no excuse for shirking chronology			2
put your photos in order so that your friends can witness the progression of your vacation - induced joy and abandon -- from slightly bedraggled relief to hugging - the - redwoods - in - @entity123 - @entity122 ecstasy			1
for those among you who have just returned from a group vacation replete with inside jokes ( " she started singing in her sleep ! " " hot drinks , really gets you going ! " " the body fit in the trunk perfectly ! " ) and shared experiences , there 's a ton of places you can view and trade snaps with your traveling companions without boring / perplexing your excluded pals			1
@entity110 recently revamped its groups feature , making it a more private , personal place to trade stories and pictures			2
there 's also a new social network called the @entity145 where you can create private groups that can only be seen by invitees			0
such venues are probably a better place to share those naked photobooth shots than , say , @entity151			0
create a guidebook via location - sharing you know that chick ? the one who 's always updating her status about her wondrous vacation experiences ? yeah			1
especially when things are slow at the office and we click over to @entity163 , where she 's describing in vivid detail the delicious goat cheese , avocado and walnut crepe she just ingested in @entity169			0
although some of you may be hesitant about location - sharing , if you 're smart about it ( i.e. only letting friends follow you on @entity175 , having a closed @entity163 account and @entity110 profile , etc. ) , @entity175 and the like can be great for sharing your experiences with your friends			1
instead of just broadcasting how much fun you 're having at that bike - punk bar in the @entity182 , check in via @entity175 and tell your friends about the awesome jukebox chock - fulla obscure polka tracks			1
that way , they can learn a little about your getaway locale of choice and perhaps get some tips for future trips			0
and , bonus for you : you 'll have a detailed record of everywhere you visited -- which comes in handy when , months later , you 're trying to remember where you met that dude who keeps texting you about seeing his metal band play when he 's in town next week			2
let people know you 're gone this may seem obvious , but , um , you should probably tell people when you go out of town for a week or so			0
yeah , you 've probably already set up your vacation responder at work ( make sure you spell everything right in that sucker ; you do n't need clients thinking you 're an idiot when you 're not even around to mess up in person ) , but your friends and relations probably wan na know your whereabouts at as well			1
you know , so they do n't think you hate them			0
we suggest putting up a non-annoying @entity110 status announcing that you 're taking off , as well as shooting off a quick mass e-mail			1
you can also use this opportunity to crowdsource your pals and ask them what to hit up while you 're off the clock			0
yeah , this level of digital checking - in might seem a little excessive , but we live in a world in which you can will your digital assets to loved ones via services like @entity226 so a quick , " hey , i 'm out of town " tweet really ai n't that extreme			0
come to think of it , you should probably check out @entity226 before that bull - running / wine - tasting trip to @entity231			0

there 's a fine line between sharing your vacation and becoming an annoyance
put up a non-annoying @entity110 status to say you 're taking off , and send a mass e-mail
@entity175 and the like can be great for sharing your experiences with your friends
