" @entity6 has the power to change the world , " @entity0 once said -- and the @entity3 prisoner - turned - president also provided perhaps the most eloquent supporting evidence for his claim			1
" it has the power to inspire , " he said			0
" it has the power to unite people in a way that little else does			0
sport can create hope where once there was only despair			0
it is more powerful than government in breaking down racial barriers			0
" that last sentence was the closest @entity0 came to referencing his own role in using sport to unify @entity3 , a country that had been separated by skin color and the warped political ideology of apartheid for nearly half a century by the time he became its first black president in 1994			1
a year after winning @entity3 's first multiracial elections , and five years after his release from prison after nearly three decades of incarceration for his anti-apartheid activities , the then - @entity33 leader revealed his acute political antennae as @entity3 hosted the @entity41			1
the sport had long been seen as the white man 's game in @entity3 , and many non-whites identified the national team , the @entity47 , as being synonymous with minority rule			1
the team 's antelope emblem had been proudly worn by the country 's whites - only sporting teams during apartheid			2
as the onetime pariah state found itself in the unusual position of welcoming the world , there were widespread fears of a racial bloodbath			0
some groups were keen to avenge the years of racial oppression , while some right - wing whites were plotting violent protests against the new black majority rule			0
despite their readmission in 1992 to international rugby , after years of apartheid - enforced sporting isolation , @entity3 used home advantage so well that the debutants reached the @entity72 final			1
the sporting , political and human drama was told in @entity76 's book " @entity0 and the @entity77 " and was made into the movie " @entity78 , " with @entity79 playing @entity0			2
@entity76 tells the story of the moment on the day of the final when white @entity3 took a man they once considered a terrorist into their hearts			2
" the day 's crowning moment came before the game had even begun , when @entity0 went out onto the field , before a crowd of 65,000 that was 95 % white , wearing the green @entity47 jersey , the old symbol of oppression , beloved of his apartheid jailers , " he wrote			2
" there was a moment of jaw - dropping disbelief , a sharp collective intake of breath , and suddenly the crowd broke into a chant , which grew steadily louder , of ' @entity0 ! @entity0 ! @entity0 ! ' " two hours later , the day 's images adopted iconic status as the " @entity105 " beat @entity106 to win the tournament , precipitating widespread celebrations , increased harmony and a mixture of both pride and hope to a @entity3 in desperate need of reconciliation			1
the photo of team captain @entity116 receiving the trophy from @entity0 , who was wearing the no. 6 jersey associated with the @entity47 ' @entity120 skipper , now takes a place of pride at the @entity123 in @entity124			2
nonetheless , dr. @entity125 , a university lecturer , sociologist and specialist in @entity3 's racial history , believes that the impact of the moment was short - lived and began to crumble within a few months of the final			1
" @entity133 and @entity0 's legacy was supposed to be about the erosion of racial categories , but that has not happened , " said @entity125			2
" this idea that sport can harmonize a nation is a clich√© that @entity3 use -- but we also know that sport can divide			2
the kindest thing to say about the dream of the @entity105 is that it has been deferred -- more realistically though , the dream has been shattered			0
what we have now is deepening racial division , with racial categories being pre-eminent again			0
" yet one of the most celebrated pages in modern race relations would never have been written had @entity0 not saved the @entity47 emblem , which was labeled " deeply offensive " by the @entity153 in the mid- 1990s because of its use in the racially divisive past			2
recognizing that whites had lost both their national flag and the elevated status of their national anthem , @entity0 understood their need to retain some identity -- and so the pacifier persuaded his colleagues that the @entity47 ' survival was key to building the new @entity3			1
@entity0 won the argument despite the @entity47 ' history of breaking the international sporting ban that the @entity33 had successfully forced on many @entity3 teams during apartheid			1
even though he had backed the boycott from his prison cell on @entity172 , @entity0 was aware of the sacrifices imposed on his nation 's best sportsmen			0
" i wanted my people to know that i became president sooner because of the sacrifices made by our athletes during the years of the boycott , " he replied when asked why he was at a soccer match involving @entity3 , rather than a politically themed event , shortly after his inauguration in may 1994			1
two years later , @entity0 and @entity3 repeated the trick -- this time with soccer , the game that was the main preserve of the country 's black community			1
with @entity0 now draped in the football jersey , @entity3 used home soil to win the @entity192 , the continent 's premier football event , at the first time of asking			1
yet @entity0 's true football legacy came when @entity3 was awarded the honor of staging the 2010 @entity72 finals , beating favorites @entity199 14 - 10 in the final vote			1
" the presence of @entity0 when we were making our bid was very , very powerful , " said @entity125			0
" we were up against some big , powerful nations , such as @entity199 and @entity206 , so to beat off @entity199 meant there had to be an extra player on the team -- and certainly the major game - changer was @entity0			1
" " it is thanks to @entity0 that the world could finally trust us to deliver this event at a world class level , " @entity211 told the @entity213 website			1
" he gave us a momentum and self - belief that we could achieve what many thought was impossible and we , and this country , will be forever grateful			0
" despite a personal tragedy on the eve of the finals -- his great - granddaughter @entity227 , 13 , died in a car crash -- @entity0 was ultimately rewarded with a tournament that shone with color , originality and , to widespread surprise outside @entity3 , fine organization			1
within @entity3 , many said they felt an increased sense of belonging as the football @entity72 , which dates back to 1930 , finally arrived in @entity3 -- the first time the continent had hosted a global event on the scale of the @entity240			1
@entity213 president @entity241 hailed @entity0 as an " extraordinary person " on thursday and recalled the ecstatic scenes at the 2010 @entity72 's closing ceremony in what proved to be @entity0 's final public appearance			1
" when he was honored and cheered by the crowd at @entity124 's @entity249 on 11 july 2010 , it was as a man of the people , a man of their hearts , and it was one of the most moving moments i have ever experienced			0
for him , the @entity72 in @entity3 truly was ' a dream come true , ' " @entity241 said in a statement on @entity213 's website			1
" @entity0 will stay in our hearts forever			0
the memories of his remarkable fight against oppression , his incredible charisma and his positive values will live on in us and with us			0
" former @entity3 international , @entity266 also paid a moving tribute			0
" the sports history books in @entity3 will show statistics and victories			2
what they wo n't show , however , was that it was @entity273 that forged those results and performances ; and united a country and its people along the way			0
no doubt , that @entity273 will live on			0
thank you @entity0 , " @entity266 wrote on his website			0
this sense of belonging is one that @entity0 maintained with his foundation , the @entity284 , which started the @entity6 for good program with the aim of using sport as a way of improving the lives of children in both @entity3 and @entity291			1
this sporting philosophy had served @entity0 himself exceptionally well during his time in prison			0
in his biography , " a @entity299 , " he explained how he followed a highly disciplined exercise regime in a bid to stay both physically and mentally healthy			0
" i have always believed that exercise is a key not only to physical health , but to peace of mind , " wrote the once - keen boxer and long - distance runner			1
" exercise dissipates tension , and tension is the enemy of serenity			0
" " in prison , having an outlet for my frustrations was absolutely essential			0
even on the island , i attempted to follow my old boxing routine of doing roadwork and muscle - building from monday to thursday and then resting for the next three days			0
" the efficacy of his discipline -- which also included 45 minutes of running " on the spot in my cell " and extensive anaerobic exercise four times a week -- was clear to see in the energy he brought to life as a free man -- keeping together the fragile , new @entity3 , visiting world leaders and becoming one of the political icons of our time			2
after 27 years behind bars , where he was allowed just one visitor a year , perhaps it was only fair that the world then came to visit @entity0 in later years -- with @entity337 , @entity338 , @entity339 , @entity340 , @entity341 and @entity342 prominent among the sporting luminaries to meet the icon			2
like the wider world , sport is unlikely to forget @entity0 , not just because of the tournaments and stadiums already named in his honor , but primarily for a day in 1995 when the anti-apartheid activist stole the show during the defeat of a team called , ironically enough , the @entity106			2
