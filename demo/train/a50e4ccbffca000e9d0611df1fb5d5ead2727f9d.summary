-- although @entity4 striker @entity3 scored nine goals in the 1966 @entity6 and @entity8 's @entity7 booted four goals to lead the home team to victory , neither of them was the real most valuable player of that year 's @entity6			1
that distinction went to an @entity8 pooch named @entity14			1
as part of the ramp - up to hosting the 1966 @entity6 , @entity8 soccer officials had been displaying the @entity18 that went to the @entity6 's winner in various places around the country			1
that march , the trophy had been residing in @entity23 in the @entity25 area of @entity26 under the watchful eyes of five guards			0
@entity0 : 7 really tiny towns something went awry on the morning of march 20 , though			0
the guard who normally stayed at the trophy 's side had the day off , and at some point when the other four members of the security detail were enjoying their coffee or a quick trip to the bathroom , thieves broke in a back door of the hall and swiped the trophy			1
as you might imagine , this theft did n't reflect too well on @entity8			1
hosting the @entity6 is a complex , logistically difficult operation , and while everything may not go totally smoothly , @entity48 at least expects host countries not to lose the trophy itself			2
the theft immediately became the biggest story in the @entity56 press , and crackpot theories and false leads soon inundated @entity59			0
@entity0 : weird stolen items like @entity62 's toilet seat eventually , the police received a ransom demand : the thief would return the trophy in exchange for £ 15,000 in small bills			2
@entity59 and soccer officials reluctantly went along with this plan , but a trailing police van spooked the thief before he led them to trophy			0
after police apprehended the suspect , a petty grifter named @entity75 , he claimed he was only a middleman who was working for a shady , possibly fictitious character known as " the pole			0
" @entity0 : 10 stars who started on @entity83 the police had their man , but they were still short one @entity18			0
that 's where @entity14 , a four - year - old mutt , entered the picture			2
on march 27 , @entity14 was out for a walk with his owner , @entity91 , in @entity26 when something under a hedge distracted the pup			1
@entity14 insisted on investigating this hedge and eventually pulled out a newsprint parcel tied together with string			2
when @entity91 opened the parcel , he realized that @entity14 had found the @entity18			1
it 's still not clear how the trophy ended up under the hedge in the first place			2
@entity0 : look what the dog swallowed ! @entity91 ran the trophy to his local police station , but the cops thought the story of @entity14 miraculously finding the trophy in a hedge was a bit far - fetched			1
they initially thought @entity91 was a suspect for the theft ; detectives even questioned him until 2:30 a.m. and made him stand in a lineup before clearing his alibi for the day of the burglary			0
once @entity91 was cleared , the media got the story , and @entity14 became an international star			0
offers to visit foreign countries rolled in for the heroic hound , and he received a free year 's supply of dog food			0
@entity14 even starred in a feature film , " the spy with the @entity127			0
" at the height of @entity14 ' popularity , he was earning £ 60 a day for @entity91			2
@entity0 : why do hockey fans throw things on the ice ? better still , when the @entity8 team won the @entity6 that year , the players asked for @entity14 to attend the celebratory banquet and even let him lick their plates clean			1
@entity91 received a £ 3,000 reward that he used to buy a house in @entity139			0
sadly , @entity14 did n't live to see the next @entity6			1
and the @entity18 was n't much luckier			2
when @entity140 won the @entity6 for the third time in 1970 , it earned the right to keep the trophy in perpetuity ; the familiar @entity146 someone will win next month made its debut in 1974			1
thieves stole the @entity18 from a locked case in @entity140 in december 1983			1
tell your pups to keep their eyes open ; the purloined trophy still has n't been recovered			0
