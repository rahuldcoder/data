voters in @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 have voted to approve sweeping pro-marijuana legalization , according to a @entity6 projections			1
the three wins have pro-legalization activists enthused and many are already looking towards 2016 , when ballot initiatives in states such as @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 are likely to be put to voters			0
in @entity1 , the law legalizes personal possession , manufacture and sale of marijuana for people 21 years of age and older			1
mimicking similar plans in @entity27 and @entity28 , the @entity1 law will also create a commercial regulatory system for the production , distribution and sale of marijuana			1
@entity2 's law is similar to @entity1 and would tax and regulate the production , sale and use of marijuana , making the use legal for people over 21 years old @entity3 's proposal , while scaled back compared to the others , allows for a person over 21 years old to posses up to two ounces of marijuana for personal use and grow up to six cannabis plants in their home			1
it also allows people to transfer up to one ounce of marijuana to another person , but not sell it			2
the issue is not fully resolved for the @entity3 , however			2
because of its unique status as a district , not a state , @entity55 has the authority to overrule @entity3 laws and some lawmakers have signaled that they would likely work to overrule the popular vote			2
pro-marijuana activists heralded the victories as " huge " on tuesday			0
' i like weed , and i 'm a good person ' : pot smokers fight stereotypes " it 's always an uphill battle to win a marijuana legalization initiative in a year like this , when young people are so much less likely to vote , which makes today 's victory all the sweeter , " said @entity69 , executive director of the @entity70 said about @entity1			1
" the pace of reform is accelerating , other states are sure to follow , and even @entity55 is poised to wake from its slumber			0
" wins in @entity3 also have activists hoping for federal recognition			2
" with marijuana legal in the federal government 's backyard , " said @entity85 , chairman of @entity86 , " it 's going to be increasingly difficult for national politicians to continue ignoring the growing majority of voters who want to end prohibition			2
" not all news was positive , however , for marijuana activists on tuesday , however			0
voters in @entity99 gave the thumbs down to medical marijuana in the the @entity99 earlier in the night , according to a @entity6 projection			1
the measure - which is one of many on ballots in 2014 - would have legalized the use of medical marijuana in @entity99 and would have tasked the state 's @entity108 with regulating it			1
because the measure would have altered @entity99 's constitution , supporters needed 60 % for the question to pass			1
only 57 % of voters voted yes , compared to 43 % who voted no with 91 % of vote reporting			0
marijuana has been a surging issue of late			0
in 2013 , according to @entity121 , more @entity120 supported legalization than those who opposed it			0
just 14 years earlier , those who opposed it had over a 2 - to - 1 advantage			0
a 2014 @entity128 poll found that 54 % of @entity120 supported making marijuana legal			0
ever since voters in @entity28 and @entity3 allowed the sale of legalized marijuana in 2014 ( after voters decided to legalize years before ) , the push for more marijuana legalization has become a popular nationwide effort			1
the laws in @entity1 and @entity2 are similar to what @entity28 and @entity27 passed and would allow recreational sale and taxation of the drug			1
both votes are expected to be close , with polls mixed on the results .			0
