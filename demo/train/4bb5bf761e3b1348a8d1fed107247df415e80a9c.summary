@entity0 -- the security video system in @entity4 's mansion could be the best witness to the teen pop star 's alleged egg attack on a neighbor			1
" it was extensive , " @entity10 's lt. @entity9 said of the system			2
" i believe it was installed very well and covered all areas of mr. @entity4 's house			1
his security system was well operated			2
" a dozen deputies , armed with a search warrant from a judge , seized the hard drives that hold the security video from last week			1
detectives are scouring the video frame - by - frame for clues as to who tossed eggs from @entity4 's property onto the house next door in the exclusive @entity31 , @entity32 , community last thursday night , @entity9 said			1
" it will either prove or disprove , or maybe neither			0
" if video from that night is missing , detectives will call for help , he said			2
" we have a high - tech crew that works on such things , depending on what we find they can tell if it 's been deleted , altered or stopped at a certain time or turned off , " @entity9 said			1
" if it 's 24 - hour security video and it does n't show a particular day , you can make your own conclusions			1
" while the neighbor who accused @entity4 of launching the egg assault does not have a similar video system , @entity49 did obtain video of the incident recorded by the accuser			1
while the attackers ca n't be seen , they are heard			0
detectives could use test that audio to determine whether there 's a match to @entity4 's voice			1
@entity4 and his representatives have stayed silent about the incident , declining to comment when contacted by @entity1			2
although the singer spoke to deputies during their search -- telling them who was in the house , for example -- he has not talked to investigators about the felony vandalism allegations , @entity9 said			0
his lawyer would need to be present for that to happen , he said			0
@entity4 's bad year : a guide @entity4 's wake up call @entity4 was asleep when investigators knocked on his door wednesday morning , @entity9 said			1
the security staff answered and let them in			0
the warrant allowed deputies to go room by room through the sprawling estate , which is how they busted @entity88 -- real name @entity89 -- who was a house guest			0
they found suspected @entity92 -- aka @entity92 -- and @entity93 near the 20 - year - old rapper 's bed , @entity9 said			2
@entity88 was arrested on a felony drug charge			0
he was later charged with felony vandalism for allegedly busting a jail phone while waiting to be bailed out			0
despite all the egg jokes dished out , this is a serious case , @entity9 said			0
the neighbor 's house suffered an estimated $ 20,000 in damage , which makes the alleged vandalism a felony			1
it could land the offender in jail , but at the every least a long probation term and community service			0
add to that the legal bills and time attending court hearings			0
deputies at the @entity115 , which serves an affluent section of @entity117 just east of @entity118 , have become familiar with @entity4 , 19 , since he moved into a $ 6.4 million home in @entity121 neighborhood two years ago			2
neighbors have dialed 911 several times to complain that the teenage multimillionaire was speeding down their residential streets in his high - performance cars			1
one neighbor accused @entity4 of spitting in his face during a heated confrontation last march			2
deputies have responded to complaints about loud parties at @entity4 's place			1
except for warnings , nothing was done			0
the @entity137 's office concluded that they could n't prove the spitting or speeding cases in court , so they declined to prosecute			0
prosecutors also rejected a misdemeanor battery complaint from a photographer who accused @entity4 of attacking him in the parking lot of a @entity31 shopping center as he was taking photos of @entity4 and his then - girlfriend , @entity147 , in may 2012			1
" we did n't do this search warrant to send a message , " @entity9 said tuesday			0
" that 's not what we do , but we hope maybe that understanding the gravity of this will change some of the behavior			1
" if detectives find evidence that @entity4 attacked his neighbor with eggs , they will present their findings to the district attorney for possible prosecution			1
this could happen in a few days or weeks , @entity9 said			0
until then , @entity4 is free to roam the world , he said			2
" i do n't feel that he 'll flee in any way			0
" @entity4 's @entity166 adventures : truth or idol gossip ?			1

security *cameras* " covered all areas of mr. @entity4 's house , " investigator says
a " high - tech crew " could help detectives if security video was erased
detectives will take any evidence of @entity4 's *involvement* in egging to the da
maybe the egg probe will change @entity4 's behavior , detective says
