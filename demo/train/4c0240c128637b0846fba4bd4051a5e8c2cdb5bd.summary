-- a @entity3 teenager 's unique prom proposal at his school 's entrance , which resulted in him being banned from the event , is garnering legislative attention , according to one state representative			1
state rep. @entity9 said he and fellow @entity11 state rep. @entity10 are drafting legislation that would allow school administrations , along with the parents and the student , to create a community - service option to determine the best course of discipline			2
this legislation comes after @entity20 , @entity3 , high school senior @entity21 , along with two friends , received an " in - house " suspension on tuesday for pasting in large letters a prom invitation on his high school 's entrance			1
the message read , " @entity31 , will you go to prom with me ? @entity33 ( hit me up ) - @entity21			1
" @entity31 accepted @entity21 's invitation			1
however , according to @entity40 officials , any student who receives an in - school or out - of - school suspension for any reason will not be allowed to attend the prom , thereby banning @entity21 and his two friends			1
" this regulation is reinforced over the course of the spring by daily ... announcements , posted signage in common areas of the building , and in classrooms , as well as information letters and automated phone messages to parents , " @entity43 , the school 's headmaster , said in a statement thursday			1
" these communications are intended to remind our students and parents of the high school expectations and consequences			0
this unfortunate situation is a result of one of those consequences			0
" @entity21 told @entity0 that the invitation " was a harmless , fun , thoughtful and creative way to ask a girl to prom			1
" " she 's my best friend , " he said of @entity31 , " and i wanted to give her something special			2
" @entity20 mayor @entity72 admited he was surprised about the amount of attention the story has received , but he said he thinks that the prom ban deserves a second look			2
" we put regulations in place that are inflexible and that do not allow for us to apply some common sense or have flexibility , " said @entity72			0
" their regulation says if a kid gets suspended after april 1st , they can not go to the prom			0
" @entity21 's prom ban is causing an outpouring of support for @entity21 and @entity31 on @entity92 ; over 110,000 people have " liked " the page " let @entity95			1
" one message reads , " this punishment does not fit this crime at all ! ! ! , " while another says , " let @entity99 to prom ! " t - shirts with the slogan " @entity103 " are also on sale			0
a website called " @entity21 senior prom 2011 " is asking supporters to make donations to help him get the " prom he deserves			2
" meanwhile , state legislator @entity9 told @entity0 , " i do think punishment is necessary but i do n't think the punishment fits the crime			0
" " it perhaps was n't smart , but creative , " @entity21 's mother @entity115 said			2
" i think they could have handled it differently , something more appropriate , " she added			0
calls to @entity40 , the @entity121 and the @entity20 school superintendent 's office were not returned			0
@entity0 's @entity123 contributed to this report .			0
