botulinum in its purest form is a deadly poison , but it can help stroke victims with pain			1
@entity5 is considered a poison with a purpose			1
millions of @entity8 use it to help smooth their wrinkles			0
as more people use @entity5 as the ultimate wrinkle remover , doctors are realizing that its benefits go far deeper than the skin			1
now it 's being used to help stroke victims			1
a study showing these benefits was released in october 2005			0
what is @entity5 ? dr. @entity22 , @entity23 chief medical correspondent : @entity5 is a brand name for botulinum toxin type a. it 's produced by the bacterium clostridium botulinum			1
in its purest form , botulinum is one of the deadliest poisons known to humans			0
it can cause death by paralysis			0
what does @entity5 do ? @entity22 : in 1989 , long before physicians injected @entity5 into faces to smooth wrinkles , the @entity36 approved it for patients with debilitating neurological diseases such as dystonia			1
in these conditions , faulty connections between brain and muscle cause parts of the body to spasm			0
muscles are locked into uncomfortable , often excruciating , positions			0
amazingly , @entity5 liberated many of these patients by actually chemically allowing their muscles to relax			1
on a basic level , that is what 's happening with @entity5 for wrinkles -- the muscle is loosening its grip on facial skin			2
this ability to stop the brain from triggering the muscle malfunction led researchers to use @entity5 for a whole host of other conditions			2
up to four in 10 stroke survivors suffer from spastic disability			2
you may recognize it as stiffness on one side of the body , often seen in a club - like hand or foot			0
these people lose their independence -- the ability to wash themselves , to eat , even walk			0
@entity5 has been used for years in these stroke patients in combination with physical therapy			1
it allows some of them to gain back mobility and function in their muscles			0
is @entity5 the perfect solution ? @entity22 : @entity5 is n't a cure - all			2
it can have minor side effects and more studies need to be done on long - term use			0
but for many patients , @entity5 provides the muscle relief that will allow them to better move their muscles			2
does it matter how much time lapses between the stroke and the patient getting @entity5 treatment ? this is definitely a case where the sooner the patient can receive the treatment , the better , so that they can regain mobility and function of their muscles .			1

bottom line : @entity5 can help stroke victims ease a painful side effect
