-- a vulture captured by @entity3 authorities is actually an @entity5 spy on a secret reconnaissance mission , a pro-government newspaper in the east @entity9 nation has claimed			1
government sources say the vulture , found in western @entity3 , was tagged with a gps - equipped camera to take and send pictures back to @entity5 , according to a december 8 story in the @entity17 newspaper			1
the bird also wore an ankle label reading " @entity20 , " " @entity21 " and the contact details of an @entity5 avian ecologist			0
the ecologist , @entity24 of the @entity25 , has rejected the @entity3 government claims -- saying the vulture , which can fly up to 600 kilometers in a single day , was tagged with gps equipment to study its migration pattern			1
" the @entity3 accusations are untrue , " @entity24 told @entity0			2
" the gps gear on these vultures can only tell us where the birds are , nothing else			0
" he said : " this is ordinary equipment that is used around the world to detect movement of wildlife			0
there are hundreds of studies using this technology on everything from butterflies and sea turtles to sharks and whales			0
" @entity24 also cast doubt on the practicality of using vultures as secret agents : " i 'm not an intelligence expert , but what would be learned from putting a camera onto a vulture ? you can not control it			1
it 's not a drone that you can send where you want			0
what would be the benefit of watching a vulture eat the insides of a dead camel ? " the griffon vulture is an endangered species in the @entity71 , according to @entity20 professor @entity72			1
his students , @entity74 and @entity75 , tagged more than 100 vultures -- 25 of them with gps trackers -- as part of a project to observe the behavior and movement of younger vultures			2
@entity24 says the data from the tagged gps vultures is n't transmitted solely back to @entity5 , but to the animal - tracking website @entity86 , where other scientists can analyze the data			1
the @entity5 scientists first knew something was amiss in early december , when the @entity91 ( pictured above ) indicated the vulture was on the ground and was moving along a road in western @entity3			1
the griffon vulture is not a migratory bird , but it is n't uncommon for them to make their way into northern @entity9 , according to @entity24 , who says the vulture 's wing tag included a message asking anyone who found the bird to contact him or the university			2
" my email address is on the vulture , " he told @entity0 , " but i never got a message			0
" the @entity5 government declined to comment on this story , and repeated calls to @entity3 officials went unanswered			2
@entity24 says that the real danger of claiming that gps - tagged birds are spies is that it could prompt government officials to kill animals they capture			1
" there is nothing new about birds tagged for studies , and if governments will not reject these types of rumors , then others will grab their weapons and hunt down wildlife -- the exact opposite of what conservationists want			0
" @entity0 's @entity132 contributed to this report .			0
