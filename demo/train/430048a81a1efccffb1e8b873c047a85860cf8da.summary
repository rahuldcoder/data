-- in @entity3 movies , they 're often portrayed as danger - dodging men with dark glasses , smoothly working behind the scenes to protect the president at any cost			0
but a group of @entity11 members drew worldwide attention over the weekend for a different reason -- accusations of misconduct involving prostitutes			1
the incident -- which allegedly occurred when agents and officers brought prostitutes to a hotel in @entity24 -- violates strict behavior rules in an agency that aims to stay out of the spotlight , and usually succeeds , experts and officials said			1
" the main problem here for the @entity11 agents is not so much a criminal violation , but really it is a dereliction of duty , not doing their job , " said @entity29 rep. @entity28 , who chairs the @entity30			1
security clearances yanked while soliciting prostitution is legal in some parts of @entity24 , it 's a breach of the agency 's conduct code , @entity29 government sources said			1
high - level officials in the @entity11 and the @entity46 were outraged over the incident , the sources said , noting that the investigation indicated the prostitutes were brought to a hotel that had been secured for the @entity51			1
but officials and analysts disagreed about how great a threat the alleged misconduct posed -- and how common it could be			0
" this is really the biggest scandal in the history of the @entity11 , " said @entity56 , a former @entity57 reporter who has written a book about the agency			1
@entity62 , a former @entity11 agent , said such allegations have never surfaced before , arguing that this is " a very isolated type of incident			1
" " the president , since the beginning of the presidential protective division ( of the @entity11 ) in 1902 , has been on hundreds and hundreds of overseas trips			1
now , this is the first time anything like this has come up			0
... in my 21 - year career , this was certainly not the norm , and i think this is certainly out of the ordinary , " @entity62 said			0
president demands ' rigorous ' investigation authorities have released few details about the allegations			0
there was a dispute over payment between at least one @entity11 member and a woman brought to his hotel , @entity29 government sources familiar with the investigation have said			1
at least one of the women brought to the hotel talked with police , and complaints were filed with the @entity29 embassy , the sources said			2
@entity29 government sources said the agents and officers under investigation were not part of the president 's personal protective detail , and stressed that there was no threat to the president			2
such details indicate that the @entity11 agents allegedly involved would not have been " in close proximity to the president , " @entity62 said			1
" a presidential advance team that goes overseas is literally a cast of hundreds , " he said			0
" you have the people who are going to be doing the various sites , the motorcade routes and so on			0
most of these people are not in direct access to the president			0
" @entity62 dismissed speculation that the @entity11 agents and officers allegedly involved could have been easy targets for blackmail			1
" in the world of espionage and foreign intelligence services , anything is possible			0
however , i just do n't see it in this case , " he said			2
" these particular individuals , i do n't believe they would have been targeted			2
... they just simply do n't have the information that would be valuable			2
" but @entity28 , who was briefed on the investigation , said there were still security concerns			0
" their job is to protect the president of the @entity29			0
they ca n't put themselves in a compromising position where they could be blackmailed or threatened , " he said			2
" nor should they bring prostitutes into a security zone 48 hours before the president of the @entity29 is arriving			2
" lawmakers say they 're troubled by scandal @entity56 , who first broke the story to the @entity57 but did not reveal his sources , said some of the @entity11 agents involved are married and could have been easy blackmail targets			1
" as a result , they could have let terrorists into secure areas and that could have resulted in assassination , " he said			2
@entity29 rep. @entity163 told @entity165 's " @entity164 " that he was n't satisfied with repeated reassurances that the president was n't in danger			1
" the investigation ... will be about how did this happen and how often has this happened before			0
things like this do n't happen once if they did n't happen before , " said the @entity173 congressman , who chairs the @entity174			1
@entity11 members sent home after incident the investigation into the allegations has stretched beyond the @entity11			1
the @entity29 military has said five @entity29 troops who were working with the @entity11 are under investigation for missing curfew and alleged misconduct at the @entity24 hotel where @entity11 agents are said to have brought prostitutes			1
on monday , @entity191 spokesman @entity190 said the number of troops involved " may be more than five			0
" speaking to reporters in @entity24 sunday , @entity29 president @entity193 said he would wait for the investigation 's results before passing judgment			0
" i expect that investigation to be thorough and i expect it to be rigorous			0
if it turns out that some of the allegations that have been made in the press are confirmed , then of course i 'll be angry , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 contributed to this report .			0
