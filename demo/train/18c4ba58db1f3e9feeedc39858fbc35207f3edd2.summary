@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 will rule thursday on the constitutionality of the sweeping health care law championed by president @entity6			1
the high court announced a series of other decisions on monday , but not the most anticipated one			0
it announced that all remaining rulings for the year will come in three days			0
the stakes can not be overstated -- what the justices decide will have an immediate and long - term impact on all @entity3 , both in how they get medicine and health care , and also in vast , yet unknown areas of " commerce			1
" saving this ruling for the final day " may not be political , but they understand drama , " said @entity21 , a @entity22 constitutional law professor			2
he added , " it 's also the most difficult case , the most important case , so they may want the extra few days to make sure that they 're happy with their written opinions			0
" the nation 's highest court heard three days of politically charged hearings in march on the @entity35 , a landmark but controversial measure passed by congressional @entity37 despite pitched @entity39 opposition			1
the challenge focused primarily on the law 's requirement that most @entity3 buy health insurance or pay a fine			1
supporters of the plan argued the " individual mandate " is necessary for the system to work , while critics argued it is an unconstitutional intrusion on individual freedom			0
all sides preparing for political fallout from health care decision four different federal appeals courts heard challenges to parts of the law before the @entity2 ruling , and came up with three different results			1
courts in @entity63 and @entity0 voted to uphold the law , while the appeals court in @entity66 struck down the individual mandate			0
a fourth panel , in @entity69 , @entity70 , put its decision off until penalties for failing to buy health insurance take effect in 2014			1
the polarizing law , dubbed " @entity35 " by many , is the signature legislation of @entity6 's time in office			2
after a lengthy and heated debate marked by intense opposition from the health insurance industry and conservative groups , the law passed @entity84 along strictly partisan lines in march 2010			1
when @entity6 signed the legislation later that month , he called it historic said it marked a " new season in @entity3			0
" while it was not the comprehensive national health care system liberals initially sought , supporters said the law would reduce health care costs , expand coverage and protect consumers			1
the law establishes a staged series of reforms over several years , including banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions , forbidding insurers from setting a dollar limit on health coverage payouts , and requiring them to cover preventative care at no additional cost to consumers			1
it also required individuals to buy health insurance , either through their employers or a state - sponsored exchange , or face a fine beginning in 2014			1
supporters argue the individual mandate is critical to the success of the legislation , because it expands the pool of people paying for insurance and ensures that healthy people do not opt out of buying insurance until they needed it			0
critics said the provision gave the government too much power over what they said should be a personal economic decision			0
twenty - six states led by @entity133 say individuals can not be forced to buy insurance , a " product " they may neither want nor need			2
and they argue that if that provision is unconstitutional , the entire law must go			0
the @entity140 countered that since every @entity3 will need medical care at some point in their lives , individuals do not " choose " whether to participate in the health care market			1
the partisan debate around such a sweeping piece of legislation has encompassed almost every traditional hot - button topic : abortion and contraception funding , state and individual rights , federal deficits , end - of - life care , and the overall economy			2
during arguments on march 27 , justice @entity158 said the law appeared to " change the relationship between the government and the individual in a profound way			2
" @entity84 ready for high court 's health care decisions -- then it gets tricky chief justice @entity168 argued that " all bets are off " when it comes to federal government authority if @entity84 was found to have the authority to regulate health care in the name of commerce			1
liberal justices , however , argued people who do n't pay into the health system by purchasing insurance make care more expensive for everyone			2
" it is not your free choice " to stay out of the market for life , justice @entity181 said during arguments			0
" i think the justices probably came into the argument with their minds made up			0
they had hundreds of briefs and months to study them , " said @entity191 , publisher of @entity192 and a prominent @entity0 attorney , though he conceded that " the oral arguments ( in march ) might have changed their minds around the margin			0
" @entity3 are largely split over the reform effort and its legality , according to polling			0
a march poll for @entity1 by @entity203 found that while support for the law appears to be growing , 50 % of @entity3 opposed the law , 43 % supported it and 7 % had no opinion			2
nearly three - quarters of respondents said they wanted the @entity2 to overturn at least some of the law 's provisions , although the poll did not specify which ones			2
the law , which helped spur the creation of the conservative tea party movement , is likely to be a centerpiece of the presidential election campaign			0
@entity6 's presumptive @entity39 opponent , @entity218 , has promised to repeal the measure if elected			0
but 76 % of respondents in the march @entity1 / @entity203 poll said a @entity2 ruling against the law still would n't change their minds about whom to vote for in november			1
the 2010 passage of the @entity35 came after months of bare - knuckled fights over politics and policy and a century of federal efforts to offer universal health care			1
the legislation signed by @entity6 reached 2,700 pages , nine major sections and 450 - some provisions			0
the first lawsuits challenging the health care overhaul began just hours after the president signed the legislation			1
