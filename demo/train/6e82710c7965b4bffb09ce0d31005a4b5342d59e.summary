-- what do @entity2 , @entity4 film studios and @entity5 venture capitalists have in common ? all have , at one stage or another , sought out @entity9 -- the @entity10 - born inventor of @entity11 , a hand - held digital camera that aims to revolutionize photography and simplify the art of taking pictures			1
@entity11 works by employing a micro-lens array to capture the entire light field -- every ray of light traveling in all directions through a scene , which regular cameras can not do -- before focusing the information captured onto a sensor			1
collecting all light data enables users to alter a picture 's focus and perspective long after the image has been taken			1
the technology caught the eye of the late @entity2 , who invited @entity9 to his @entity33 home to demo the device , and attracted a cool $ 50 million start - up cash from eager venture capitalists			1

@entity9 took time out to speak to @entity0 about his invention and how he transformed @entity11 from a @entity45 phd project into a potentially lucrative commercial reality			1
@entity0 : what makes lytro such a revolutionary invention ? @entity9 : it lets you focus pictures after you take the shot and this really enriches your creativity as it makes a totally new kind of interactive picture			1
it also lets you share that creativity online with your friends and family ... ( and ) can be embedded fully into social networks such as @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			0
@entity0 : what was the inspiration for the @entity11 camera ? @entity68 : i am a very keen photographer			1
i have enjoyed taking pictures since i was a kid with my family , but i became more serious about it at university			2
from the academic side , i was studying pictures from a computer graphic stance and the theory of the light field			2
on the personal side , i was rock climbing and taking pictures with my friends			2
we took all sorts of portrait and action pictures and i was thinking at the time that these are inherently difficult to focus correctly			1
that made me ask questions about the computer graphics of the light field that i was studying academically , and if those could be applied in commercial photography			0
@entity0 : how long has the process of invention to market taken you ? @entity68 : i started the company in 2006 and i had been working on research for about three years before that			0
personally , i 've been working on it for about nine years			0
we 've gone through about three rounds of venture capital with some of the best venture capitalists in @entity5			0
in total we 've raised approximately $ 50 million in investment			0
see also : how the @entity107 took over the world @entity0 : you made a prototype when researching your dissertation , did you realize you were sitting on a multi-million dollar invention ? @entity68 : the idea to try and commercialize came very late and it is something that is not very natural to me being an academic			0
there were two eureka moments during the phd , if you will			0
the first was taking these equations ( about the optical architecture of the light field ) and starting to simulate them on a computer			0
the second was very similar except it was more physical			0
we built a prototype camera where you could take a picture using the software developed during the simulation stage			1
@entity0 : does @entity11 make skilled photography redundant ? @entity68 : i think it 's a very compelling idea that you 'll never take a bad picture anymore , but that 's not what this camera is about			1
it 's not a magical device ... but it does let you take pictures very rapidly and without having to worry about things like focus , like you do with a regular camera			1
basically , with a regular camera you have to take time or allow the camera to focus before you take the shot			1
because we can allow you to focus after you 've taken the picture by capturing the full light field , we can trigger the shutter instantly without delay			1
and people find that very helpful			2
@entity0 : what was it like being invited to meet @entity2 ? @entity68 : it really was an incredible experience			0
not too many people have the chance to do that			2
like many people out there i 'm inspired by the level of attention to detail , design and execution of @entity169 products			2
getting to meet him was exciting as he 's a very inspiring person			2
we discussed a range of topics and it was terrific to [ meet ] like that in a one - on - one setting			2
see also : teach young people to be innovative @entity0 : has it been easy combining the business and science side of things ? @entity68 : it was the hardest thing i 've ever done , for sure			0
entrepreneurship is a very full body immersion into a very diverse skill set			0
being able to execute technically through to a vision of a product that can be compelled to people and then being able to communicate that			0
i had to develop a lot of these very different aspects , but more importantly i have also met a lot of people who have joined @entity11 , invested in @entity11 or become partners with @entity11 that have helped us to grow this vision of bringing computational photography to consumer cameras			1
@entity0 : from your experiences with @entity11 , is commercial savvy something that modern inventors require just as much as a scientific or creative mind ? @entity68 : i think so , absolutely			1
more importantly , the company that intends to commercialize an idea will need to have all of those skill sets ( technical , business and commercial ) represented			0
i still definitely have n't mastered all of those skills			0
we have over 100 people working on this to bring it up to market and bring it forward now			0
but i do think that technical inventors will have to prove their vision of how those technologies will move into products that make sense for markets and for customers			0
@entity0 : and finally , what would your advice be to would - be inventors wrestling with tomorrow 's big ideas ? @entity68 : think big and have perseverance .			1

@entity9 is the @entity10 - born inventor of the @entity11 camera
@entity9 hopes the hand - held digital device will come to revolutionize how people take pictures
