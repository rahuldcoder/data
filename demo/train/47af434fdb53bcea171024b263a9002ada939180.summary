@entity1 , @entity0 -- the view will be one unlike any other			2
climbing up through the clouds at a rate faster than the speed of sound , the sky will darken to a deep blue and then to black			2
below , entire mountain ranges , coastlines and cities will shift into focus as the horizon bends around the curvature of the @entity15 - the thin veil of its atmosphere shimmering against a backdrop of stars			2
an emerging space tourism industry may give thousands of travelers a new view of @entity15			1
and then , of course , there will be the feeling of weightlessness			2
" it is just life changing , " said col. @entity27 , a retired @entity28 shuttle commander			2
" to be outside the atmosphere and see the curvature of the @entity15 and see so much land area at once , it gives you a sense of separateness but connectedness			0
" the view of @entity15 from outer space is a sight that in the history of mankind only a few hundred people have ever seen			1
but that could soon change as what was once an almost nonexistent space tourism industry slowly matures into what some analysts predict could be a billion dollar enterprise with thousands of passengers by the end of the next decade			1
" this is just the beginning of the golden age of space flight , " said @entity52 , chairman of the @entity53 , which awarded the $ 10 million @entity54 in 2004 for the first privately funded human flight to the edge of space			1
" looking back a thousand years from now , this will be the period of time when the human race irrevocably moved off the planet			0
" look back roughly ten years , though , and the idea of sending tourists into space seemed more like science fiction than a viable business plan , said @entity70 , executive director of the @entity71 , a trade association representing the space travel industry			1
" no one ever thought this was real at all , " said @entity70			0
" it was just completely unthinkable			0
" but that perception began to change in 2001 when @entity78 multimillionaire @entity77 became the world 's first so - called space tourist , traveling aboard a @entity82 soyuz capsule to the @entity83 for a price of around $ 20 million			1
four more tourists have since made the trip			0
another major milestone for the industry has been a growing interest and investment from entrepreneurs like @entity93 co-founder @entity92 , who financed the development of @entity95 , winner of the @entity54 , and @entity98 billionaire @entity97 , founder of the space tourism company , @entity101			1
" since then the activity has been more evenly spread and steadier and more consistent and more determined , " said @entity70			0
" now you have a number of companies working on multiple fronts to get people into space			1
" there are now at least a dozen space tourism endeavors worldwide , offering experiences that range from a flight to the fringe of space to astronaut training on a tropical island			1
while the companies make up a varied landscape of technological know - how , financial wherewithal and enterprising ideas , they all share one common goal : the desire to conquer what is widely considered to be the final frontier of mankind -- the universe			0
" the human species is about evolution and is about moving forward , " said @entity128 , president of @entity129 , the @entity130 - based company responsible for arranging civilian trips to the space station on the @entity133			1
" @entity129 is filled with infinite resources that can make our lives better			0
" this october , @entity139 , a computer - game developer and son of former @entity28 astronaut @entity142 , is scheduled to become @entity129 ' sixth client to leave the planet followed by a seventh yet - to - be identified passenger next april			0
@entity129 is also planning to build commercial spaceports near @entity147 and in @entity148			1
but @entity128 said the next big step involves something slightly further afield - a trip to the @entity152			0
with a price tag of $ 100 million per seat , two tourists and a pilot would spend around two weeks board a modified @entity82 spacecraft with the chance to see an @entity15 rise from lunar orbit and cruise around the @entity161			0
the excursion will launch when contracts are finalized with travelers , @entity129 said			1
suborbital space tourism is also set to take off soon			1
for $ 200,000 , @entity101 passengers will undergo several days of training before taking a two - hour flight to the fringe of space - 70 miles above sea level			1
from there , the company says , passengers will experience the feeling of weightlessness and see a view of the @entity15 that spans a 1,000 miles in any direction			1
@entity178 , president of @entity101 , said the company has collected $ 35 million in deposits from 250 would - be space tourists			1
another 80,000 have registered interest with the company , he said			1
" that figure has been growing month by month the past year , especially as we get finished building the technology , " said @entity178			0
@entity101 will begin testing @entity185 this summer , said @entity178			0
the carrier vehicle will ferry suborbital craft @entity187 , modeled after @entity54 winner @entity95 , 50,000 feet in the sky before releasing it			0
" once we have tested that sufficiently , we will put the spaceship underneath it , " said @entity178			0
other companies are also jumping in the suborbital space race			2
in march , @entity198 - based @entity197 announced plans to build the @entity200 , a two - seater rocketship that will carry passengers up into the atmosphere for about $ 100,000			0
the vehicle will be the size of a small business jet , capable of making several flights a day , the company said			2
and last year , @entity210 aerospace giant @entity209 announced plans for its astrium space division to develop a line of suborbital jets to satisfy a space tourism market that it predicts could grow to as many as 15,000 passengers a year by 2020			1
" the market is there , " said @entity218 , chief technical officer of @entity219			0
" the question is how to build the planes that can satisfy that market and to understand what profits at the end we can make out of it			2
