a review by @entity126 for the @entity128 talks of how the book gives " glimpses of this immense human tragedy in @entity3 's characteristically plain - spoken narrative " but is also " tinged with odd nostalgia for the ephemeral moment when @entity114 seemed to birth a national culture			2

he was a gift to the world , " he said			0

the most fitting is the simple and elegant phrase , ' a great tree has fallen			0
' " in an interview for the @entity210 in 1994 , @entity3 spoke of how his early love of stories made him realize that they only reflected the point of view of the white man			0
