@entity0 -- five years ago , not many people knew of @entity3 or sequestration or had seen a tricorne hat			1
today , all are familiar in the political arena because of the tea party movement that emerged in 2009			1
for better or worse , the coming together of frustrated conservatives fearing @entity11 ruin due to rising debt has altered the national discussion to raise the profile of people and policies previously relegated to the right - wing fringe			0
@entity18 fear tea party challengers in primaries			1
@entity21 complain about the tea party caucus			1
the fiscal conversation focuses on reducing deficits and even reforming entitlement programs that make up the social safety net			0
here 's a kind of " greatest hits of the tea party , volume one " : 1 ) protesting patriots never in the past 200 or so years have so many worn tricorne hats and other @entity34 - era garb to make their political point			1
at protests and rallies that began in february 2009 to spawn the tea party movement , the overwhelmingly white , middle - aged and older participants dressed the part of past patriots protesting against taxation without representation			1
they also adopted the @entity46 flag of the the 18th century -- a coiled snake warning " do n't tread on me			0
" it reflected the movement 's link to the @entity52 of 1773 that helped launch the @entity53 , while some note that the word " tea " in the label is a backronym for " taxed enough already			2
" top tea party group celebrates five years such romanticism ignores the private funding from big conservative donors , such as the billionaire @entity63 , that helped amalgamate scattered local organizations into a more coherent movement with national focus			1
2 ) @entity70 fury @entity72 headlines scream with @entity18 rage over president @entity75 's signature health care reforms that passed in 2010 with zero @entity77 votes			2
the roots of such fury emerge from the origins of the tea party movement -- conservative anger over the stimulus bill that contained more than $ 800 billion in tax relief and spending to help the economy recover from recession			1
tea party zealots as well as mainstream republicans and independents also disliked the auto industry bailouts and financial sector rescue started under the previous administration of @entity18 president @entity94			1
that anger helped @entity75 and @entity21 win big in 2008			0
with control of the @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 , @entity21 pushed through the stimulus bill in 2009 and the @entity70 bill a year later			0
anyone who attended or watched ca n't forget how opponents of the health reforms flooded public hearings on the proposal to spew full - throated attacks			0
supporters got shouted down , shoving matches occurred , and the resulting perception was that middle - class @entity11 would never accept @entity70			0
today , @entity18 and conservative groups try to maintain that perception with mixed results			2
3 ) @entity18 control of the @entity99 @entity117 anger over the stimulus bill and @entity70 translated to a conservative campaign onslaught in the 2010 congressional elections , with private groups freed from previous funding restrictions because of the @entity124 decision by the @entity125			2
@entity3 angers @entity77 colleagues -- again republicans won back the @entity99 by gaining 63 seats in a major shift , with dozens of tea party - backed newcomers joining the @entity77 caucus			1
advocating showdown politics and brinksmanship over federal spending and raising the federal borrowing limit , the @entity18 - led @entity99 forced a rightward shift on fiscal issues that resulted in more austere policies , more fights between the parties and mounting public disgust with dysfunction in @entity0			0
4 ) @entity21 control of the @entity98 " i 'm not a witch , " declared @entity145 , a moment that symbolized how the tea party movement doomed @entity18 chances to gain control of the @entity98 in 2010			1
a conservative activist , @entity145 entered the @entity18 primary to fill the @entity98 seat vacated by vice president @entity154			0
so did former @entity156 gov. @entity155 , a nine - term @entity11 congressman , who was heavily favored to win and refused to debate her			0
with strong tea party support , @entity145 beat @entity155 by 6 percentage points with strong backing from conservative southern @entity156 , but she proved too inexperienced and downright flaky for the pressures of a full - fledged @entity98 campaign			1
comedian @entity164 unearthed a 1999 clip from a tv show he hosted in which @entity145 talked about dabbling in witchcraft , and she responded with a commercial that opened with her flat - out denial			0
@entity98 passes debt - ceiling plan in blow to tea party it went downhill from there , and @entity173 easily defeated @entity145 by 57 % -40 % in november			1
a similar scenario occurred in @entity175 , where conservative @entity176 defeated favored lt. gov. @entity177 in the @entity77 @entity98 primary , then lost to @entity180 @entity179 in the general election			0
two years later in @entity182 , @entity18 @entity183 beat veteran sen. @entity184 in the primary , then lost the race for the seat @entity184 had held for six terms to @entity21 rep. @entity189			0
5 ) @entity3 and @entity190 who had heard of either politician back in 2009 ? today , both are household names after @entity190 used her status as a tea party favorite to run for president in 2012 and @entity3 rode @entity117 backing to get elected as a senator from @entity200 the same year			1
@entity190 railed against @entity70 and federal spending in her energetic but short - lived campaign best remembered for her frequent outlandish and accuracy challenged statements			0
she won the @entity206 straw poll in august 2011 to get an early jump on the crowded @entity77 field , but her novelty flamed out and she finished sixth in the @entity206 caucuses the following january			0
@entity190 dropped out of the race shortly thereafter , and now is leaving @entity211 altogether at the end of 2014			0
@entity3 is on an opposite trajectory			0
more than any of the other tea party stalwarts elected in recent years , he has walked the talk by repeatedly taking on the @entity0 establishment of both parties in quixotic escapades that gain him notoriety at the expense of @entity77 clout			1
@entity200 tea partier wants @entity77 on @entity3 control last september , @entity3 waged a 21 - hour filibuster against a government spending extension , at one point reading aloud the dr. @entity229 book " @entity232 " to his children back home , as part of his crusade against @entity70			1
his tactics led to a 16 - day government shutdown in october that failed to gain @entity18 anything but public scorn for the political shenanigans involved			2
@entity240 , @entity3 recently forced fellow @entity18 in the @entity98 to join @entity21 in overcoming his filibuster of a measure to raise the federal borrowing limit so the @entity11 would n't default on its bills			2
@entity77 leaders wanted to let the measure pass with no @entity18 support so they could blame @entity21 , but @entity3 's filibuster threatened an impasse that could have rattled financial markets and possibly brought a downgrade of the @entity11 credit rating			2
fearful that @entity18 would again be blamed for @entity0 dysfunction , @entity77 leader @entity253 led a dozen aisle - crossers who voted with @entity21 to end the @entity3 filibuster , then rejoined fellow @entity18 in opposing the measure in the final vote that only needed @entity21 support to pass			2
afterward , @entity3 complained that such political " show " votes hurt the party much more than his ideological purity of trying to wring more spending cuts out of @entity21 in order to pass the debt ceiling hike			2
in the end , it remained unclear whether such antics will hurt or help the freshman senator considered a possible @entity77 presidential contender as soon as 2016			0
6 ) new vocabulary who had heard of sequestration five years ago ? today it is part of the political - policy vocabulary , thanks in part to the way that the tea party changed the conversation through its laser focus on issues such as the national debt , the federal budget and entitlement spending			1
the refusal by tea party @entity18 in the @entity99 to accept business - as - usual compromises on federal spending caused a series of showdowns with @entity75 and @entity21			1
one brought a compromise that included sequestration -- across - the - board cuts in government spending , including the military			0
while sparing entitlement programs such as @entity302 , @entity303 and @entity304 , the sequester cuts came closest to the @entity117 goal of shrinking government to lower deficits			0
now @entity211 has started undoing the sequestration limits , angering tea party conservatives and putting pressure on @entity18 candidates in november congressional elections who supported the december budget compromise			1
7 ) poor @entity315 few sights have been as politically expressive as @entity99 speaker @entity317 repeatedly having to drop legislation he supported because he was unable to get his own caucus to back him			0
the ability of tea party @entity18 to undermine compromises with @entity21 pushed by @entity317 demonstrated the @entity77 split between the mainstream leadership and more extremist newcomers			1
@entity52 sotu response : ' @entity70 is an inequality godzilla ' after the government shutdown in october , @entity317 adopted a tougher stance by criticizing tea party tactics that harmed @entity18			1
earlier this month , he joined 27 other @entity18 to vote with 193 @entity21 in passing the debt - ceiling hike over the objections of 199 republicans			0
even @entity317 's long - time political foe , @entity99 minority leader @entity333 , sounded sympathetic on thursday , calling on republicans to " take back your party " from what she described as extremists			2
" i think ( the tea party ) considered it a success when they shut down government and i do n't think that was for the good of the nation , " @entity333 said , adding that the tea party " hijacked the name @entity18			1
" 8 ) @entity348 targeting without a tea party movement , there would have been no tea party groups for @entity348 officials to screen out when checking applications for tax - exempt status			1
it turns out that liberal groups also were targeted for extra scrutiny , based on specific words in their names , as the @entity348 tried to figure out if new organizations were trying to skirt election funding limits by claiming they were 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) social welfare organizations			0
conservative @entity18 continue crying foul , but investigations so far found no deliberate political machinations by the @entity348			2
@entity1 's @entity367 , @entity368 , @entity369 and @entity370 contributed to this report .			0

for better or worse , the tea party movement has made a *difference*
who heard of @entity3 or sequestration back in 2009 ?
protesting patriots or political *obstructionists* ?
mainstream @entity18 are pushing back
