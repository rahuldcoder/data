-- @entity1 is n't just one of the world 's most influential people			1
she 's also the world 's most powerful celebrity , according to @entity6			1
the publication has released its annual celebrity 100 list and has named @entity9 @entity1 to the top spot			2
when you consider the year she 's had , there 's little reason to wonder why			0
after giving what many viewed as a virtually flawless performance at the @entity17 , @entity1 has n't paused , embarking on a grand global tour while also readying the release of her self - titled visual album , " @entity1			0
" when that disc arrived to fans ' pleasant surprise in december 2013 , the singer notched her fifth no. 1 on the @entity28 chart , and sparked a platinum hit with the lead single , " @entity21			0
" ( @entity31 referenced the record when talking about her past with former president @entity34			0
) and yet , as @entity6 notes , @entity1 's empire is n't limited to the music business			2
while she 's setting out on joint tours with her husband -- they 're currently crossing the country with their " @entity43 " trek -- @entity1 's also managing her clothing company , line of perfumes , and collaborations with brands like @entity49 and @entity50			0
all told , @entity6 estimates that @entity1 earned roughly $ 115 million between june 2013 and june 2014			1
by comparison , her husband made an estimated $ 60 million , enough to put him in sixth place behind @entity53 ( no. 4 at $ 82 million ) and @entity54 ( no. 5 , at $ 70 million )			2
so who 's the person standing directly in @entity1 's shadow ? that would be basketball star @entity59 , who arrived at no. 2 on @entity6 ' celebrity 100 list , having made an estimated $ 72 million as of june 2014 .			1
