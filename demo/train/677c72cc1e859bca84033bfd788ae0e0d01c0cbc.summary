-- @entity1 wakes up at 5am for morning prayers with her family , gets the kids off to school , and then charges off to work on the several other jobs she is actually paid to do			0
" most people only have dreams and dreams are goals without a deadline , without any action			0
so that does n't work , if you want to dream something , you dream big and then you make it into a goal and so you set a deadline , when you want to have it and how you want to achieve it , and then you start working on it , " @entity1 said			0
she does n't just dream big , she executes and that is exactly what she advises her clients at @entity26 to do			0
in her late 20 's @entity1 went from being a stay at home mom to running her own company that now boasts hundreds of clients			2
" it took time and after thirteen clients i ran out of cousins to contact ! so i said to my partners at that time , ' we need to expand to different areas here , ' " said @entity1			2
she ended up marching down to a local radio station in @entity40 and throwing out an idea			0
" i said to them , ' i want this to be an honest radio talk show [ host ] ; if one company wants to sell their products and if i think that product sucks , i get to say it on air			0
' and they loved it ; they were like , ' oh like @entity54 ? ' ' yes , yes , like @entity54 but with the hijab , ' i said			0
" @entity1 is a practicing muslim and one of @entity59 's young movers and shakers			1
she says when her traditional @entity56 husband wanted her to stay at home and be a mother and housewife , she agreed			0
with the pressure of having to make money off her shoulders @entity1 said it gave her the ability to dream and try out different businesses			0
she tried seven different business , all failed			0
then she found her passion by remembering what she loved doing when she was in school			0
" actually when i was in high school , i actually wrote down when i grow up i wanted to become a businesswoman who works with people 's money			2
i did n't even know that there 's a profession as a financial planner , " she said			2
the @entity59 government is banking on people like @entity1			1
@entity59 is betting on its young minds to help its economy boom in the coming years			1
half of @entity59 's population is under 29 - years - old			1
" we call this the ' demographic dividend ' , which i think will put us in good shape to have productivity increases for the next ten , fifteen , even 20 years in the future , " @entity89 , @entity59 's trade minister , told @entity0			1
@entity95 fits into that demographic			2
at 26 - years - old he capitalized on something he thought was missing from @entity59 's marketplace			1
" they did n't really believe yogurt was going to be a big hit , " @entity95 said			1
investors did n't believe then but they do now			0
in two and a half years , @entity95 's " @entity104 " brand yogurt has gone from one store to 26 in @entity59 and it 's about to go international opening its first store in @entity109 in december			1
but there are still hurdles for @entity59 's young people			1
about 14 percent of the population still lives below the country 's poverty line and poverty is most concentrated among those with little or no formal education			1
@entity89 warns the education system needs to be improved to give its up - and - comers the tools to compete			2
as for young ceo 's @entity1 and @entity95 they brought back business know how from universities abroad and have been experiencing the taste of success ever since			1
" because i started young and i 'm still young i think success is not just a destination for me , " @entity95 said			1
" success is a journey , and so it 's never ending			0

around half of @entity59 's population is under 29
young *entrepreneurs* are helping to fuel the country 's economic boom
some like frozen yogurt chain owner @entity95 looking to expand abroad
poverty and lack of education for wider population still a problem
