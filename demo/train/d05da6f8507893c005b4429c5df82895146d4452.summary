@entity0 has executed two imprisoned jihadists in retaliation for the murder of its pilot , @entity5 , by @entity6			1
the executions follow @entity0 's initial agreement to release one of the jihadists , @entity9 -- a demand made by the group through a video statement by one of its @entity16 hostages -- in return for the pilot			1
the release of a gruesome video by @entity6 , which calls itself the @entity22 , on february 4 , showing @entity5 being burnt alive triggered the @entity0 decision to carry out the executions few hours later			2
in doing so , @entity0 has dragged itself deeper into the @entity27 conflict and exposed further weaknesses in the strategy followed by the @entity31 - led international coalition set up to fight @entity6			1
neither of the jihadists executed by @entity0 are connected with @entity6 in its current incarnation , but with @entity35			1
for example , one of them is @entity39 , an @entity40 national linked with the @entity41 in @entity40 leader @entity42 and who had been detained in @entity0 on death row since 2006			0
through their execution , therefore , @entity0 has inadvertently strengthened the link between @entity6 and @entity35			1
this is significant because the two groups have been engaged in a battle over resources and legitimacy since the start of the @entity27 conflict			0
@entity6 has been trying to present itself as the " true " @entity35 , causing the latter to increase its military activities worldwide as well as within @entity27 to affirm its influence			1
despite initial condemnation of the brutality of @entity6 , @entity35 's @entity27 offshoot @entity56 has recently begun engaging in similar activities itself , such as beheadings and other forms of public violence			1
one reason behind this is that @entity56 has felt upstaged by the @entity22 and has escalated its violent acts in order to assert its presence in the face of its rival			0
but another reason is that the actions of the international coalition set up to fight @entity6 have pushed the two groups together			0
the coalition airstrikes in @entity27 have targeted both @entity6 and @entity56 , thereby presenting the groups with a common enemy			2
the @entity27 regime 's attacks on @entity6 following the organization 's advance in @entity40 in june 2014 also shifted the position of @entity6 away from the regime , aligning the organization with @entity56 , which still regards fighting the @entity85 regime as its primary objective			2
in the @entity89 area bordering @entity27 and @entity87 , @entity6 and @entity56 have begun cooperating against the @entity27 regime and @entity91			0
the coalition 's mediocre support for the moderate @entity27 opposition in southern areas of @entity27 not only contributed to the @entity97 's vulnerability to attack by @entity56 brigades but also pushed some members of the two entities to maintain a working relationship based on material necessity and backed by sharing the mutual goal of fighting the @entity85 regime			1
today , several towns along @entity27 's south - western border witness @entity56 presence			0
in the north , a number of towns have shifted their alliance from @entity56 to @entity6 due to a number of reasons , from fear to coercion to seeking material gains			0
now that @entity6 and @entity56 have been pushed towards one another even more as a result of the @entity0 executions , a similar shift of allegiance is likely in southern @entity27 towns as well			1
if that were to happen , @entity0 , which has borders with southern @entity27 , would find itself with @entity6 on its doorstep overnight			1
this bears bad news for the coalition			0
the south is where the @entity97 retains more control than anywhere else in @entity27 , and where the coalition is planning on empowering the moderate opposition through training and weapons provision			0
being confronted with @entity6 in the area derails this plan			0
the presence of @entity6 in the south would also push @entity0 to escalate the level of its engagement in the @entity27 conflict			1
it will be forced to change from a supporter of its patrons , the @entity31 and @entity148 , in their fights against @entity6 and into a participant in frontline warfare with the organization			0
this will in turn trigger further entrenchment by not just those two countries but also other members of the coalition in the war as they scramble to aid their @entity0 ally in its fight against @entity6			1
such a development would heighten the reactive nature of the coalition 's strategy towards @entity6			0
@entity0 's executions have already demonstrated that countries within the coalition do not have a uniform strategy for dealing with hostage crises and act singularly and in haste			2
all this is playing into the hands of @entity6 , which has been calculating its moves carefully -- the @entity0 pilot had been executed weeks before , @entity0 authorities believe , during which time it had been fooling the @entity0 government by demanding the release of @entity9 , in a build - up towards the final planned humiliation that came with the release of evidence of @entity5 's murder			2
@entity0 's revenge , then , marks a major shift in the war against the @entity22			2
it is a shift that is likely to change the nature of the actors in the @entity27 conflict as @entity6 and @entity56 move closer to one another			2
it is also a shift that will trigger wider regional repercussions , and drag members of the @entity198 coalition into an open - ended confrontation on a wider scale than before			1
in the midst of all this , the moderate @entity27 opposition risks becoming extinct			0
the international coalition therefore simply can not afford to continue to act in the @entity27 conflict without having in place a harmonized , long - term , and proactive strategy that takes into account the urgent need to end the conflict through a political - military plan rather than a reactive one based on irrational retaliation and limited military activity .			0

@entity0 's execution of two jihadists will strengthen link between @entity6 and @entity35 , says @entity218
@entity218 : shift of allegiance in southern @entity27 could mean @entity0 has @entity6 on its doorstep overnight
move will drag members of @entity198 coalition into open - ended confrontation , she adds
