-- i 'm not a violent man			1
short , self - doubting gingers tend not to be the fiercest of creatures			1
but if you are sitting next to me on a plane i will absolutely fight you for the armrest			1
mind you , when i say " fight , " i mean " create a mental checklist of things i would do to you in the event that i suddenly ceased to be a short , self - doubting ginger			1
" so , you 're safe			2
sadly , when it comes to hand - to - hand combat , my signature move is silent resignation			1
thus , when it comes to armrests , i resort to strategy and the early boarding benefits bestowed upon me by virtue of having an airline credit card			2
do n't scoff at early boarding			2
i 'd sooner give up my pants than @entity26			2
truthfully , though , you can just have my pants			2
of course , there are a number of other great reasons for boarding early -- the big one being that i 'm able to quickly secure my bag in an overhead compartment before they all fill up with the four - wheeled shipping containers some of you now feel qualify as a small personal item			1
but it 's definitely also about getting seated and into the ready position			2
which is to say : body wide			2
" claimed ! " nothing greedy			0
just simply taking what 's rightfully mine in accordance with the rules			0
in @entity50 ( episode four ) of the brilliant tv series " @entity53 , " comedian @entity49 perfectly details these rules from his middle seat as he battles another passenger for the right to be mildly more comfortable			0
" you do n't know plane etiquette , " @entity49 shouts to the man sitting to his left			1
" window gets an armrest and a wall			1
aisle gets an armrest and a little bit of extra leg			1
we 're not animals ! we live in a society ! " so , those are the rules			0
not that any of you are going to follow them			0
fortunately , however , there 's a new armrest design that may settle the matter once and for all			1
it 's called the @entity82 , and throughout the week it seemed to be popping up all over the @entity84 and social media			0
apparently armrest inequality is quite the hot - button issue , so it struck a nerve with anyone who 's ever had a boarding pass that included the letter b or @entity93 the @entity95 - based team at @entity96 claim their innovation solves the " perennial problem of fighting for elbow room in high - density seating " by using " double - deck geometry			1
" the basic idea is this : paperclip 's armrest extends out as normal but then , at the end , it curls up several inches and fishhooks back for several more , making use of the " vertical space " to create a second deck			1
so , one person gets the lower			0
and one person takes the upper			0
sadly , this does not qualify you for the @entity115			0
all that said , i still think the design has a critical flaw			1
you see , while the person using the upper deck is mostly getting support for his or her forearm , the person using the lower deck gets to position the entirety of his or her elbow directly on the rest			0
@entity131 starts in the elbow			0
later , in the same scene from that episode of " @entity53 , " the man arguing with @entity49 eventually says , " i am only taking the back of the armrest			1
you can have all the rest			0
" @entity141 drives home the importance of the elbow by replying , " you take the back , you take the whole damn thing			0
" so , the @entity82 might not be a perfect design -- i 'm certainly not convinced -- but it does seem to be a start			1
however , until we finally sort it out , we 're just going to have to obey the rules and force them upon those who act like animals			0
which is to say : body wide			0
follow @ @entity157 on @entity158 .			0

@entity96 envisions an armrest that can be *shared* by airplane passengers
the design incorporates " vertical space " to create a double - decker armrest
@entity167 : until we have a solution that works , we all need to abide by airplane etiquette
