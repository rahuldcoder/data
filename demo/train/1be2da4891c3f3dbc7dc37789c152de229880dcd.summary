@entity0 -- he came to @entity3 as a young man who loved the @entity6 lifestyle , wanted to make money and have fun			1
" @entity14 style , " smiled @entity9 as he began his testimony wednesday in his federal trial on terrorism charges			1
the 56 - year - old @entity15 - born @entity9 worked as a bouncer and strip - club manager before bits of @entity20 teachings from friends began to penetrate his mind , he testified			1
the hypocrisy of his lifestyle hit him like a slap in the face			0
@entity27 would go on to become the high - profile imam of a @entity3 mosque and allegedly inspired several notorious terrorists with his sermons , including failed shoe bomber @entity32 and 9/11 hijacker @entity33			1
@entity27 testified he has n't spoken before a crowd since his 2004 arrest and said a decade in solitary confinement has eroded his memory and grasp of language			2
the trial has been reinvigorating , said @entity9 , and the preacher drew laughter from the courtroom wednesday afternoon as he used examples of marital spats to illustrate the practical application of @entity20 truth			1
@entity27 will continue his testimony thursday morning			2
attorneys for @entity9 have said he may be their only witness			2
the @entity50 cleric pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of terrorism - related charges in 2012			1
he was extradited to the @entity14 after a lengthy legal battle			2
the charges against @entity9 involve supporting efforts to establish an @entity57 training camp in rural @entity58 , sending a young recruit from @entity3 to fight alongside @entity60 on the front lines in @entity62 , and aiding kidnappers in @entity64 with the 1998 abduction of a tour group			1
" he was a trainer , a terrorist , and he used the cover of religion so he could hide in plain sight in @entity3 , " said assistant u.s. attorney @entity67 in his opening statement			1
weapons and gas masks were found at @entity9 's @entity3 mosque , the prosecutor said : " tools of war stockpiled in a place of worship			1
" the government 's three - week case has been an effort to connect the dots between @entity9 and events thousands of miles away from hi , through key witnesses who often had never met the defendant and are testifying as government informants in deals with the prosecution			1
defense lawyer @entity91 told the jury in his opening statement that no evidence links the cleric to the alleged crimes -- " not in @entity64 , not in @entity58 , not in @entity62			1
" @entity91 said his client " never gave directions or orders to people " and served merely as a " commenter on events and issues " when he lauded the @entity104 leader @entity103 and celebrated the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			1
" these are ideas , not acts , " he said			0
" these are expressions , not crimes			0
" prosecutors called their final witness wednesday morning to testify about the 1998 kidnapping of 16 tourists in @entity64			0
@entity114 traveled with the tour group on the morning of december 28 , 1998 , when a large group of men in two pickup trucks blocked the road and abducted the travelers			0
@entity121 managed to flee after wrestling an @entity123 assault rifle from one of the captors , according to opening statements			0
@entity121 testified that she decided to write a book about the ordeal and traveled to @entity3 to do research and conduct interviews for the project			2
she approached @entity9 outside his mosque one friday morning in the fall of 2000 , because he 'd stated publicly that he knew the kidnappers , and he agreed to speak to her			2
when she explained that she was one of the kidnapped tourists , the cleric leaned back in his desk chair and gazed at her , she said			0
@entity121 says he told her , " i 'm surprised you would come here			0
" @entity27 is alleged to have provided the kidnappers with a satellite phone to use in the incident			2
in a conversation she recorded at his @entity3 mosque , @entity121 asked if he had provided the phone			2
" yeah , perhaps , " @entity9 says on the recording , which was played for the jury			2
in other excerpts of the recorded conversation played in the courtroom , @entity9 can be heard telling @entity121 that she and the other hostages were intended as ransom for prisoners held by the @entity64 government , possibly including @entity9 's own son and stepson			1
the leader of the abductors was a " softhearted person , " said @entity9			2
while @entity9 would not confirm to @entity121 that he 'd known about the kidnapping ahead of time , he did tell her that the perpetrators did n't expect the deadly shootout with government forces			2
" we never thought it would be that bad , " he said			0
one of @entity121 's fellow travelers , @entity171 , testified tuesday about the harrowing kidnapping experience , saying the travelers were used as human shields during a gun battle between her captors and the @entity64 military that left four tourists dead			0
@entity171 was shot in the leg , and walked with a significant limp as she took the stand			0
a @entity50 telecommunications company employee , @entity183 , testified tuesday that he sold a satellite phone to the defendant several months before the kidnapping			0
another pivotal witness against @entity9 was the @entity188 man who conceived the idea for a pay - as - you - go jihad training camp on a large patch of barren land outside @entity194 , @entity58 , in 1999			1
@entity195 testified he pitched the idea for the camp to the defendant in a fax. " it looks just like @entity62 , " @entity195 wrote to the prominent preacher , asking for trainers in both the physical and spiritual aspects of holy war to be sent from @entity3 so fighters could be readied for the @entity62 front lines			1
@entity195 testified that his note promised scores of eager recruits who 'd already pledged their loyalty to the preacher , along with a hillside hiding place and personal security detail when he arrived at the camp			0
they were amassing stockpiles of weapons , and building living facilities and even a mosque , wrote @entity195			0
these were lies , he testified ; there were no recruits or weapons , and the ranch 's only living structures were two run - down trailers			2
" if he accepted it , i 'd know i had a buy - in and i 'd start building			0
" @entity27 's presence was crucial to getting the cash flow started , @entity195 testified : " he 'd be the star attraction			1
" two men were allegedly sent by @entity9 to aid with the effort , carrying cash and training materials , but left once they realized @entity195 's promises were empty , according to testimony			1
@entity195 later worked for @entity9 at his @entity3 mosque and ran the website of supporters of @entity242 , an organization the defendant headed , he testified			1
in 2000 , the defendant ordered him to deliver a young man , @entity246 , to a front line commander in @entity62 , he testified , along with envelopes of cash to a girls ' school and widows of holy warriors			0
he instead abandoned @entity246 in a @entity253 guesthouse			0
@entity195 admitted on the stand that his past is marred by a range of criminal endeavors , including selling stolen laptops and knock - off watches he picked up in @entity0 and passed off as expensive brand originals			0
he spent approximately six years in prison for his role in the defendant 's alleged endeavors and testified as part of a deal with the government that allowed for a significant reduction in jail time			0
another witness , @entity270 , testified to later seeing @entity246 at an @entity62 training camp and gave jurors a glimpse into the world of recruits there ; a world where @entity103 himself handed out awards for target shooting , and classmates included future 9/11 hijackers			1
@entity270 , who reached a deal for leniency with @entity50 prosecutors in exchange for his testimony , took the stand via closed circuit television from @entity3 because of his steadfast refusal to risk traveling to the @entity14 , where he faces additional charges			1
the charges against @entity270 both in the @entity50 and the @entity14 center on his plan to join @entity32 in a suicide mission to take down commercial airliners with shoe bombs			1
@entity270 testified he backed out of the mission after reconnecting with his family			0
the prosecution also called terrorism expert @entity301 to introduce jurors to the key figures of @entity60 and the @entity305 regime , and to testify about the crucial role non-al @entity60 members like @entity9 play for the organization , providing financial support and spreading its message			1
@entity311 cuts an unusual figure in the courtroom ; missing one eye and both hands , he wears an occasional writing prosthesis on his right forearm rather than the infamous hook - like device he 's often seen sporting in photographs			0
opting for comfort , he asked his attorneys for sweat pants and t - shirts for the proceedings , rather than a suit			0
he could face life in prison if convicted .			0
