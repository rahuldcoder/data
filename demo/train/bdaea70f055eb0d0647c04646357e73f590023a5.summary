@entity6 , the man accused of committing the biggest intelligence leak in @entity9 history			1
on wednesday , @entity6 's defense attorney spent a brief 35 minutes questioning two witnesses before resting his case			1
@entity6 's @entity14 hearing is part of the military 's process of determining whether he should face court martial			1
the first defense witness called was sgt. @entity21 who served with @entity6 in @entity22 and witnessed one of several angry outbursts witnesses have described			1
@entity26 blog : @entity6 and the need to share @entity21 was the senior enlisted man on the night shift in the intelligence office where @entity6 worked			1
he testified that in december 2009 , @entity6 was late for duty and they sat down in a conference room so @entity21 could counsel him			1
@entity21 said when they began talking , @entity6 was calm , but that he began to change			2
at some point , said @entity21 , @entity6 grabbed the conference room table and turned the table over , knocking a computer and radio to the floor			2
because there was a rifle in the room , @entity21 testified that he did n't want @entity6 to get his hands on it , so " i coaxed him away from that , put my hands on his shoulder and coaxed him away			2
" at that point another soldier came in the room , subdued @entity6 , sat him down and @entity21 continued counseling him , @entity21 testified			2
when asked by @entity6 's attorney @entity52 if @entity21 remembered master sgt. @entity53 , the senior enlisted man in the unit , talking with him about the incident , @entity21 said " vaguely			1
" @entity21 testified that he did not discuss the outburst with the major who oversaw the intelligence analysis officers , the company 's first sergeant nor the company commander			2
@entity6 was not moved out of the intelligence office after the outburst and did not lose his security clearance as a result of the outburst			1
@entity52 has argued that the @entity66 should have known about @entity6 's emotional issues and kept him away from classified materials			1
@entity6 is accused of stealing and leaking nearly three - quarters of a million classified documents from the @entity70 and the @entity71 to the @entity73 website , which published many of them			2
the leaks occurred while @entity6 was serving as an intelligence analyst in @entity22 in 2009 and 2010			2
prosecution witnesses testified that @entity6 downloaded and leaked 400,000 @entity71 field reports from @entity22 and 90,0000 similar documents from @entity81			1
there was also evidence presented that he downloaded and leaked more than 250,000 @entity70 cables			0
@entity86 's second witness , capt. @entity85 , testified by phone about his time with @entity6 's unit			1
for a short time in december 2009 , he was an officer in the intelligence analysis office where @entity6 worked			0
@entity85 said he often saw soldiers listening to music in the office where classified materials were analyzed			0
at first he thought it was not proper , but he was told it was " an accepted practice " that was " tolerated because it helped soldiers be more productive			0
" in news reports before the hearing , @entity6 is said to have bragged in a chat room that he was able to download materials onto a cd while pretending to listen to @entity102			1
@entity85 told the hearing , " i do feel like he wanted to be a good soldier			0
he did good analytical work			0
" even though he called only two , @entity52 had requested 48 witnesses , 10 of whom were already on the prosecution witness list			0
the investigating officer overseeing the case granted those 10 and two other defense witnesses who were not on the prosecution list			0
he rejected other requested defense witnesses , including president @entity115 and secretary of state @entity116			0
@entity117 , a national security attorney , said the fact the defense called only two witnesses is not surprising			0
" for one thing , an @entity14 ( hearing ) serves as an opportunity for the defense to obtain pre-trial discovery , and particularly information they do not know			0
additionally , the likelihood of stopping charges from going forward is non-existent in this case so there is little value in telegraphing to the prosecution information the defense may possess but might not yet have revealed , " said @entity117 .			0
