-- one day after joining more than a score of other women accusing @entity4 , famed model @entity5 told @entity0 that the legendary comedian 's reputation for such acts was a secret in @entity11 -- one she only wished she knew about 30 years ago			1
@entity5 detailed her own story about @entity4 in @entity13 on thursday , claiming he drugged her during a meeting at his @entity16 residence in the 1980s			1
she said in that article -- and again friday on @entity0 's " @entity18 " -- that she does n't believe he sexually assaulted her then , but she yelled obscenities at him before he dragged her outside and put her into a taxi			1
as more women have come out against @entity4 in recent weeks , many of whom say the comedian did rape them , @entity5 said she began talking to people in the entertainment business about her own story			1
" the response was , ' oh yeah , we know he has been doing that for quite a while			0
' it was like , everyone knew , " @entity5 said			2
" but people like myself , i most certainly would n't have gone to @entity4 's brownstone if i knew the reputation he had with assaulting women			1
" @entity4 facing litany of allegations including @entity5 , at least 23 women have spoken out to various media outlets with accusations against @entity4			1
this number includes 20 who have spoken with @entity0 , spoken on camera about their allegations or been the subject of responses from @entity4 's attorneys			1
@entity0 has reached out to @entity4 's attorney @entity54 about @entity5 's allegation , but has not heard back yet			1
but overall , the comedian 's camp has strongly and persistently denied these allegations			0
@entity5 : all of @entity59 was a @entity4 fan @entity5 burst onto the scene as a model in 1970s , becoming the first @entity64 - @entity59 woman to appear on the cover of @entity66			1
but she was in a rough patch in mid- ' 80s , coming off a rough divorce that included a difficult custody battle , when her agent called to say that @entity4 wanted her to audition for " @entity71			0
" @entity5 said that -- as someone trying to get more roles as an actress -- she was " very excited " by the prospect of appearing on tv 's no. 1 show headlined by one of the nation 's most revered figures			2
" there was n't a bigger figure in the entertainment industry than @entity4 and i was a big fan , " she said			2
" i do n't know anyone in white @entity59 or black @entity59 that was not a fan of @entity4 and ' @entity71			1
' " @entity5 met up with @entity4 , including one meeting in which she took her young daughter to @entity4 's brownstone			1
" he was very charming , very nice to my daughter and i , " she recalled			0
" he suggested that i come back in a couple of days to rehearse the scene in ' @entity71			0
' " claims she cursed comedian so @entity5 did go back , this time alone			0
as she recalled to @entity0 , @entity4 offered her a cappuccino and was " very insistent " she take it , promising that it would " be the best coffee that i 've ever had			2
" " the first sensation was a little woozy , and so then i took another sip , " @entity5 said			0
" after that second sip , i knew i had been drugged			0
it was very powerful , it came on very quickly			0
the room started to spin			0
" steadying herself on @entity4 , @entity5 claimed she " just kind of cocked my head , because at that point i knew that he had drugged me , " and told him , " you are a ( motherf * * * * * ) , are n't you ? " " i knew that he had drugged me , and i wanted him to know that he had drugged me , " she said			1
" and the only word i could get out was ( that expletive ) , and i kept saying it to him louder and louder			0
" @entity5 admits her recollection at this point were hazy , though she remembered @entity4 becoming angry , grabbing her by one arm , dragging her outside and flagging down a taxi for her			2
" all i remember after i got into that taxi cab , and somehow telling ( the driver ) my address ( was ) saying , ' did i just call @entity4 an @entity119 ? ' i was concerned about him , rather than me			0
" @entity4 a ' powerful man ' in the industry in the @entity13 article , @entity5 wrote that she tried a few days later to call @entity4 on a private number so he could " come clean and explain why he 'd done what he had			2
" @entity4 's wife , @entity126 , answered the phone			1
when @entity5 asked to speak to @entity4 , @entity126 told her it was late and they were in bed			1
@entity5 said she 'd call back , but never did			0
talking to @entity0 about why she did n't go public then with her story , @entity5 explained that she was drugged but did n't think she was sexually assaulted and also spoke of beinging ashamed of speaking out			1
the fact the man she 'd be accusing was @entity4 also factored in			0
" ( he was a ) powerful man in an industry that i would like to be a part of , " she said			0
" that went through my mind			0
" in her live interview with @entity0 , @entity5 said she did n't " want to see anything happen to @entity4 " by sharing her story			1
what she does want -- besides showing solidarity with other @entity4 accusers , like her longtime friend @entity143 -- is for her speaking out to encourage others who have been the victims of sexual assault by any perpetrator to speak up			2
" this , to me , is not about @entity4			0
this , to me , is about violence against women , " @entity5 said			2
" ... what i want to see happen is that women come out and speak their truth			2

new : @entity5 : everyone in " @entity156 " and " black @entity59 " were @entity4 fans
new : she recalls cocking her head , cursing at @entity4 , believing he drugged her
she says @entity4 's *sordid* reputation was a secret in @entity11 , but she did n't know
the famed model tells @entity0 : i want more women victims to " speak the truth "
