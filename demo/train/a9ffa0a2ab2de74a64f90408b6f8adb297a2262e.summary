-- one thing did shock me on my visit to @entity4 last month : the immigration officer at @entity6 smiled as he stamped my passport			1
this rare travel incident set the tone for the rest of my trip			2
you would n't know it for all the diplomatic sound and fury that surround the country , but possibly the most exceptional thing about @entity4 compared with the other @entity19 countries i 've been to -- and i 've visited them all , as a roving travel correspondent and @entity19 specialist -- is how almost manically welcoming everyone is			1
other than that , its extraordinary archaeological wealth , palaces dripping with former regal indulgence , elaborate @entity27 gardens and urban skylines bristling with minarets deserve to place it alongside @entity34 and @entity35 on the international tourist circuit			2
whether the election of @entity38 to the presidency earlier this month will spur more travel to the country remains to be seen , but his moderate political stance at home and abroad at least bodes well for tourism			1
@entity46 immersion sure , there are things you might not be used to in @entity4			1
the country follows @entity46 law , of course , but it 's not as sinister as some people think			1
women must cover their heads with a shawl ( including in the photo they send in with their visa application ) and alcohol is prohibited			0
but most of the obstacles to travel in @entity4 arise before you get there			1
no doubt your acquaintances will try to put you off , for a start , made wary by the overwhelmingly tense news that emanates from the country			0
tourist visas , too , can take up to a month to obtain			2
on the bright side , most are -- eventually -- issued without question			2
then there are the typically dire but , in my experience , exaggerated @entity78 government travel advisories on the country			2
curiously , while @entity81 advises " against all travel " to @entity4 , the @entity80 merely suggests its citizens " carefully consider the risks " of a trip			1
those ultra-cautious advisories , like an overprotective aunt , also risk invalidating your travel insurance -- so be sure to check the fine print of your policy if you have one			1
but perhaps the greatest risk of visiting this member of the former " axis of evil , " as @entity96 memorably described it , is being profiled by your own government			1
zoroastrian fire temple am i putting you off yet ? well , let 's consider what you 'll miss out on if you do n't one day slot @entity4 into your travel itinerary : most travelers who do take the plunge come away raving about the place			1
among the highlights of my recent visit was the zoroastrian fire temple in the city of @entity112 , whose flame is said to have burned since 470 ad			2
nearby , i climbed to the hilltop @entity116 , where the @entity118 dead were picked clean by vultures to avoid contaminating the earth right up until the 1960s			0
then there 's the @entity124 ( @entity125 ; +98 21 6446 3785 ) in @entity6 -- where most travelers start their @entity4 trip -- located in a vault beneath the @entity129			1
among its treasures are the 182 - carat @entity133 diamond , so chunky and iridescent it virtually constitutes its own light source			0
there , too , you 'll find the emerald , sapphire and pearl - studded @entity139 , stolen by one of the shahs from a @entity143 emperor			0
fancy a further glimpse of @entity4 before the january 1979 @entity145 , which sent the last shah into exile and turned the country into one of the @entity151 's biggest bad boys ? there 's the grand @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 palaces , unchanged since that seismic political event			1
they 're all worth visiting			0
what you wo n't find in @entity6 are surly crowds chanting anti-western slogans or hustlers similar to those cruising the streets of @entity166 and @entity167			1
@entity168 @entity169 is the next stop on many @entity4 itineraries , with its @entity168 said to be the second largest such urban space in the world after @entity174 in @entity175			1
facing this immodest expanse are the gloriously tiled @entity178 and @entity179 mosques , the seven - story @entity180 and the entrance portal to the huge @entity183			0
nearby , the 16th - and 17th - century frescoes of the @entity185 are alive with color and incident			0
frescoes also illuminate the @entity190 south of the @entity191 , itself crossed by three massive 17th - century stone bridges			0
in @entity194 , in south - central @entity4 , wine production may have dried up but some of the finest gardens , historic homes , mosques and markets in the country remain			1
most people stop by @entity194 en route to ancient @entity203 , less than an hour to the northeast			2
the ruins of this ancient @entity207 capital , built by @entity208 in 520 @entity209 and sacked by the equally great @entity210 200 years later , were buried under sand until the 1930s and are well preserved			0
@entity208 and @entity213 a short drive from @entity203 is @entity215 , with the cliff tombs of the @entity207 kings @entity218 , @entity213 and @entity219			0
finally , @entity112 , on the @entity220 toward @entity221 , has one of the largest and best preserved medieval quarters in the @entity19			0
the portal of @entity225 ( 1324 ) is the highest in the country with towering twin minarets , a hallmark of the @entity230 faction of @entity27			0
there , again , is that eerie zoroastrian fire temple , with its apparently unquenchable flame			0
these sights stay with you as markers of a great , enduring civilization			2
but perhaps the most enduring memory is how universally friendly ordinary @entity4 are			1
in a world in which jaded attitudes about tourists reach from @entity244 to @entity245 , it may take a while before it stops feeling strange			0
@entity247 has written guidebooks for @entity249 and @entity250 .			0

travel to member of former " axis of evil " may increase with election of new president
biggest *surprise* of @entity4 travel is people 's overwhelming friendliness
most obstacles to a visit arise beforehand -- visas can be slow
*architectural* and historic sights rank with @entity167
