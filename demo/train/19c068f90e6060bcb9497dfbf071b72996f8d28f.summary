he had been on the run for four decades			2
he escaped from prison when @entity3 was in the @entity4 , joined the @entity5 in @entity6 , hijacked a plane and ( in ) famously demanded that @entity9 agents deliver ransom money in bathing suits			1
now , after a manhunt spanning three continents that often appeared to run cold , the @entity9 has finally found @entity15			1
at age 68 , he was living quietly in the resort of @entity18 near @entity19 in @entity20 when he was arrested monday			1
the @entity21 is seeking his extradition from @entity20 to serve the remainder of a 15 - to 30 - year sentence for murder			1
@entity20 judicial authorities could not be reached tuesday for details of the extradition process			1
@entity15 is fighting extradition , a @entity21 federal agent said , and his next court appearance in @entity20 is in about two weeks			1
@entity15 's life story reads like an international crime novel			1
in 1962 , at the age of 19 , he and three associates carried out a series of robberies in @entity38			0
@entity15 and another man shot and killed a @entity41 veteran in a gas station robbery in @entity43			2
he was arrested soon afterward and , after pleading no defense , was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison			1
but in 1970 , @entity15 escaped from @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity38 , reportedly stealing the warden 's car to make his getaway			1
@entity15 made his way to @entity6 , then a hotbed of militant black politics , and joined the @entity5			2
( he is also reputed to have made some money during this period as a part - time model , using an alias			0
) on july 31 , 1972 , @entity15 and four other members of the @entity5 went to @entity6 airport and boarded @entity60 for @entity61			2
@entity15 was dressed as a priest and carried a handgun in a hollowed - out @entity64			1
airport security was different in those days			0
various @entity67 groups were hijacking planes regularly , as were individuals keen to go to @entity70			0
altogether , the @entity21 @entity71 recorded 364 hijackings worldwide between 1968 and 1972 : more than one a week on average			0
the hijackers of @entity75 -- three men and two women accompanied by three children -- seized the plane as it approached @entity61			0
the @entity9 says " subsequent investigation identified @entity15 as one of the hijackers			2
" once on the ground , the hijackers demanded that @entity9 agents dressed only in bathing suits deliver $ 1 million ransom to the plane			0
they wanted to be sure the agents were not carrying guns			0
the money was duly delivered by the scantily clad agents			0
the hijackers allowed the 88 passengers off but kept the flight crew on board and ordered that the plane fly to @entity95			2
with the addition of an extra navigator ( wearing swim trunks and a shirt ) , the @entity96 was refueled there and flew on to @entity102			0
@entity103 in the early 1970s was run by a hard - line socialist government that was no friend of the @entity21 and allowed various dissidents , militants and alleged terrorists to take sanctuary there			1
a leading member of the @entity112 , @entity111 , had been welcomed as a political refugee there in 1968 after jumping bail in @entity116			0
the @entity103 government confiscated and returned the $ 1 million in ransom money to the @entity21 , but @entity15 and his associates melted away			1
some of the hijackers were arrested in @entity121 in 1976 , but for decades , there was no trace of @entity15			1
then , nine years ago , a fugitive investigator with the @entity38 @entity125 working with the @entity126 got a lead			0
officials wo n't comment on reports that @entity15 had begun to contact relatives in the @entity21			2
@entity131 , @entity21 marshal for the @entity132 , said : " over the course of nine years , their tenacious resolve has proven to be very powerful in seeking justice and closure for the victims			0
" and in a press release tuesday , @entity138 of the @entity9 's @entity139 said the case should " serve notice that the @entity9 's determination in pursuing subjects will not diminish over time or distance			0
" at the time of the hijacking , there was limited screening of passengers at @entity21 airports			1
this screening system did not require every passenger to be examined , only those who met a profile established by the @entity157			0
after the @entity102 flight and several hijackings that turned violent , the @entity3 administration instructed the @entity157 to adopt emergency regulations to improve screening			0
at the end of 1972 , the @entity157 ordered airports to ensure that all passengers and their carry - on baggage be inspected before boarding .			1

@entity15 , 68 , arrested monday in @entity20 resort town
he escaped from prison in 1970 and hijacked plane to get to @entity103
there was no trace of him for decades afterward
