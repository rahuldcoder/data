-- @entity1 stood on the back porch of his newly rented @entity3 , @entity4 , home , thankful for his @entity7 landlord and worried that his previous home , parked in the driveway , would n't get him to work the next day			1
@entity1 and @entity10 stand next to their camper with baby son , @entity13			1
his 1977 @entity15 camper , which @entity1 rescued from a salvage yard , had carried him , his wife , @entity10 , and 4 - month - old son , @entity13 , from @entity19 to @entity4 earlier this summer , a cross-country sojourn in search of work			1
he was uncertain it could handle the 14 - mile commute the next morning , but he 'd make do			2
" i 'm gon na get up extra early every morning like i have been , and if it [ the camper ] does n't get to work , i 'm gon na hitchhike , " @entity1 said last week			1
" i have a wife and a son to support			1
" @entity1 had been making $ 12 an hour plus commission at his information technology job in @entity31 , @entity19			1
@entity10 was working part - time in a candle shop , and between them they pulled in a little more than $ 2,500 a month			1
but @entity10 , 21 , quit to have the baby , and they moved into a bigger , more expensive house to accommodate their larger family			1
as june approached , @entity1 , 36 , was told his hours and commission were being cut as @entity19 's economy sank			1
" it got to the point where $ 6.50 an hour with a house just ai n't gon na happen			1
i was trying to do good for my family , but what can i do ? " he asked			2
his last day of work in @entity19 was june 30			1
with @entity19 's unemployment rate at 10.6 percent in june , according to the @entity51 @entity50 , he investigated where prospects might be better , settling on @entity4 ( 7.6 unemployment ) , and if things did n't work out there , @entity56 ( the nation 's lowest unemployment at 4.2 percent )			1
the @entity1 family prepared for the trip by holding a yard sale a few days before they were set to leave @entity31 , a town of 1,800 near @entity63			2
they dutifully cleaned up the home they rented but could no longer afford			0
" you 're not going to pay the rent , you get out of the house , you know ? " @entity1 said			1
they hit the road with $ 1,000 in cash , a cell phone , some food and what clothing they could fit			1
the rickety old camper required some minor repairs along the way : a new battery strap after being bounced around on a rough @entity83 highway , some brake work after one stuck near @entity85 , @entity86			1
@entity1 said he sold wire art in taverns during the journey to earn extra money			0
he was teased by opportunities that did n't pan out			2
" i never actually saw this before , but some towns are actually putting billboards up that say ' this town has jobs , ' " he said of his travels through the nation 's heartland			2
" i actually went to check it out , " he said			0
" they 've got a couple jobs , but nothing really great			0
they 've got some jobs i 'm not qualified for , in the medical field , " he said			0
still without work after arriving in @entity4 , the @entity107 lived " out in the woods " for a few weeks			1
they did n't consider themselves homeless , @entity1 said , " just camping			2
" using computers at a local office supply store and the library , @entity1 and his family have been able to tap private and public assistance to care for themselves			1
a local church has taken care of some day - to - day needs			2
" i went down and talked to them and said , ' hey this is what the situation is , if there 's any help available			2
' they said they could probably help us out with food , baby needs , " @entity1 said			0
" and we 're actually going to apply for medical assistance			0
" as for food stamps , @entity1 said he 'd rather the program be used on the infirm than someone like himself who could provide -- no matter how meager the fixings -- for his family			0
" i 'm sure there 's other people out there that do n't have the motivation or the ability [ to work ] that can use the food stamps , " he said			2
@entity10 does n't fret about the family 's circumstances either			1
she said she leaves " all the financial details up to @entity1			0
" " my main job is to take care of @entity13 , " she said			0
life got a bit easier on july 20 , when @entity1 landed work at an auto parts store			1
a person he connected with through an online forum offered the @entity156 for $ 350 a month rent , a $ 400 discount off the normal price			2
the home 's owner is working a temporary contract construction job on the other side of @entity4 , @entity1 said , enabling the deal			1
but the " @entity170 " sign out front and real estate agent 's lockbox on the front door remind @entity1 about how temporary his lodgings may be			0
while he 's grateful for the auto parts job , nothing is certain there either			1
a national chain is trying to take over the independent retailer , he said			0
" it 's a struggling company , " @entity1 said			0
" at the same time , he 's busy enough to where he needs three people behind the counter			0
" he 's making $ 10 an hour			2
but he knows that wo n't keep his family housed when the cheap rent goes away			1
" at this point we have a place to stay for two or three months			0
he said ' maybe three , probably two , ' " @entity1 said , recounting his landlord 's words			0
" i like it here			0
i just need something better - paying , " he said			0
if he did n't find something soon , he said , " at this point , i 'll be right back into the same scenario			0
" but for the moment , the @entity107 are enjoying what they have			0
" the house is great			0
it 's a one - bedroom , it kind of looks like somebody decided to build an @entity199			2
it has a really , really nice view , " @entity10 said			0
drinking in the surroundings on the back porch , @entity1 agrees			0
" i have the most awesome view , " @entity1 said , looking at the foothills of the @entity205			0
" i ca n't bring myself to walk off the back porch			1

@entity19 *man* 's pay is reduced until he ca n't support his family
he fixes up rickety camper and with wife , baby and $ 1,000 , sets off for @entity4
they camp in woods until someone offers a reduced - rent house
he finds a job at an auto parts store , but still fears for future
