-- the two men vying to lead @entity2 is a study in contrasts : a self - made furniture salesman who has sprang into contention for the country 's top political job , and a former general with a long military history who projects a strongman image			1
in the fourth election for the young @entity2 democracy , @entity13 and @entity14 are in contention to lead a country with a slowed economy and rising voter concerns about corruption in government			1
one of them will become the head of the most populous @entity26 nation for the next five years when voters make their choice on july 9			0
@entity13 commonly known by his nickname " @entity13 , " @entity13 , 53 , has been compared to the 2008 vintage of @entity31 in part for his charisma and focus on change , and also because he represents a break from the political establishment			1
styling himself as a man of the people , @entity13 eschews business suits for checkered shirts with his sleeves rolled up			1
as a self - made businessman turned @entity45 governor , @entity13 would be the first president without a connection to the military or the country 's traditional elite			1
" in order to resolve problems in @entity2 related to rule of law and fighting corruption , it can only be done by a new figure , not by someone who 's been taken hostage by the past , " @entity13 told @entity0			1
much like @entity31 's sprightly first campaign , @entity13 relies heavily on his personal history and his image as an outsider			1
that appeal helped @entity63 charge ahead in opinion polls earlier this year , when he appeared to be a virtual lock for the presidency			0
but much of his lead has eroded following smear campaigns suggesting that he is of @entity70 descent or even a @entity71 -- a deal breaker for many in this @entity26 - majority nation			0
the attacks have sidetracked his campaign and prompted @entity13 to release evidence of his upbringing and photos of his haj pilgrimages to @entity81			2
the smear campaigns have " forced @entity13 on the defensive on issues of his personal identity , " instead of being able to put up a progressive vision for the country , said @entity82 , an analyst with @entity83 , based in @entity45			2
born in the central @entity90 of @entity91 , @entity13 grew up in a slum on the banks of the @entity94			2
his family lived in illegally - built shacks , in which they were evicted by the government			0
this background has helped his appeal among the country 's poor			0
" @entity13 is very popular among farmers and the common people , " said @entity104 , a professor at @entity105 who specializes in political psychology			2
" his image is that he is part of the people			0
" @entity13 worked in his family 's furniture business before starting his own export company , which he made a huge success			1
in 2005 , he was elected mayor of @entity91 and became known for his spontaneous visits to slums , which drew media attention , and unannounced drop - ins at government offices to catch under - performing workers			0
he rose to become @entity45 governor in 2012 , where he piloted new healthcare and education programs			0
but critics say @entity13 is too inexperienced and has n't finished his work in @entity45 after only 18 months in the governor 's office			1
several major projects , including a new railway , remain behind schedule			0
@entity63 's policy platform tends to be grounded by his own experience as a businessman			0
he speaks on the campaign trail about the difficulty of licensing and regulations , and the need to simplify the bureaucracy to help businesses succeed			0
@entity13 says to help @entity2 's economy , the government has to tackle corruption			1
" we will issue a decree related to strengthening a bureaucracy that is clean and always there to serve , " he said			0
" this way , we can attract more investment to @entity2 and consequently create more jobs			2
" @entity14 @entity14 has framed himself as the strong , decisive leader , calling for more nationalistic policies			2
in a nod to both his military background and his @entity26 faith , @entity14 styles himself in a khaki military - style shirt and fez , much like his former father - in - law , @entity163 , the country 's second president			1
a hulking presence , @entity14 even arrived to campaign events mounted on a @entity168 horse -- a famed breed used in dressage			2
" he 's the most experienced presidential candidate in @entity171 , " said @entity82			0
" he 's been doing this for at least a decade			0
" @entity14 ran for president in 2004 and for vice-president in 2009			2
he has never held public office			0
as leader of the @entity178 ( @entity179 ) party , he has touted his military service and projected the image of a decisive man capable of taking charge			1
most voters " have aspirations for a strong leader who will turn @entity2 to have a stronger position in @entity171 , " said @entity184 , managing director of @entity185 , a @entity45 think tank			1
very much part of the country 's traditional establishment , @entity14 , 62 , is the son of the nation 's leading economist			1
he also became part of one of the most influential families when he married @entity163 's daughter , @entity200 in 1983			0
they have since divorced , but his ex-wife backs his candidacy , even appearing publicly in his campaign events			0
@entity163 , who passed away in 2008 , led a dictatorship in @entity2 for 32 years , which was marred by allegations of corruption , repression and the politically - motivated killings of an estimated 500,000 to a million opponents and dissidents			1
his downfall in 1998 ushered in an era of democracy in @entity2			2
@entity14 's military service during the time of @entity163 's reign has cast doubts over his human rights record , having served in controversial campaigns in @entity222 and @entity223 , which have both had independence movements , with @entity223 achieving nationhood in 2002			1
@entity14 , however , has played up his military record -- he became a lieutenant general in the army -- which has proven to be both a blessing and a curse for his campaign			1
he is accused of several human rights violations , including the kidnapping of activists during the 1998 mass protests that led to @entity163 's downfall			0
@entity14 has denied allegations , while human rights activists say he has not been held to account for his alleged actions			2
@entity14 was removed from his military post in 1998			1
@entity14 's former military boss , @entity243 who supports @entity13 in the presidential race , said in a televised press conference that @entity14 had been discharged for ordering the abduction of pro-democracy activists			1
in 2000 , @entity14 was denied a visa to the @entity249 , believed to stem from his human rights record			1
a @entity252 spokesman said it 's not taking a position on @entity2 's presidential candidates but added that " we do , however , take seriously allegations of human rights abuses , and urge the @entity2 government to fully investigate the claims			1
" the spokesman declined to comment about whether @entity14 's visa denial would be reversed if he were to be elected			1
when asked about the @entity249 visa issue by @entity263 , he replied , " @entity264 was blacklisted from the @entity249 at one time			0
am i not in good company ? " @entity14 's representatives did not get back to @entity0 regarding an interview request by the time of publication			2
regarding the allegations , @entity14 has maintained that he was following orders			0
" i am the staunchest human rights defender in this country , " he said during a televised debate in early june			0
@entity0 's @entity275 contributed to this report from @entity45 .			0

@entity2 's voters to choose between military man or self - made furniture salesman
@entity13 has drawn comparisons to @entity31 for his image as an outsider seeking to *reform*
