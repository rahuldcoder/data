-- when @entity2 took one small step onto the moon in 1969 , it seemed only a matter of time before the advent of thriving space colonies and summer vacations on distant planets			2
but after an initial flurry of moon landings , manned lunar expeditions dwindled : the last time an astronaut left his footprints on the moon was in 1972			2
plants such as lettuce , peppers and tomatoes will be on the menu at @entity21			0
then , in january 2004 , president @entity22 announced @entity24 's intention to return humans to the moon by 2020 , and in 2006 , @entity24 announced plans to set up a manned lunar outpost by 2024 , with the @entity30 and @entity31 space agencies now planning bases of their own			1
after years in limbo , the dream of living in space is alive once more			2
sustaining long - term space habitation presents space agencies with a whole new set of technological and logistical challenges			1
currently , the @entity40 supports three astronauts in a low @entity43 orbit , with food supplied periodically by space shuttle			1
but , just as home cooking is cheaper than getting takeout , when it comes to more permanent settlements , this kind of supply voyages would be prohibitively expensive : we will need to grow our own food in space			1
@entity55 , a plant physiologist at @entity56 , explained to @entity0 , " in the near term it 's not needed , for example on the space station and initial short sorties to the moon , but as you go further and stay longer , regenerative systems become much more cost effective			1
" @entity55 sees this development of space farming as a gradual process in which space outposts become increasingly self - sufficient			1
" it would probably be evolutionary , " he said			0
" the first human missions to @entity72 might set out with everything stowed , but they might set up the beginnings of an in - situ production system -- maybe a plant chamber -- that you could use to grow perishable foods			2
you would n't be providing everything , but in subsequent missions if you returned there you could expand the infrastructure			0
" of course , this means growing plants in conditions very different from those on @entity43			0
yet research has shown that plants are surprisingly adaptable			0
for example , while plants normally use gravity to direct the growth of their stems and roots , in low gravity conditions they can use light to orient themselves			0
and research suggests that plants can grow well even at very low atmospheric pressures			0
that reduces the leakage of oxygen and carbon dioxide from their growth chamber out into space , but crucially , it also reduces the structural requirements of a " space greenhouse , " meaning less construction material needs to be shipped into orbit			1
nor is the absence of soil a problem			0
many supermarket vegetables are already grown hydroponically in nutrient - enriched water , and research indicates this technique could work well in space			1
some have even suggested the loose rock regolith on the surface of the moon or @entity72 as a growing medium , although additional minerals would need to be brought from @entity43			0
so what 's on the menu at @entity21 ? well , initial crops would need to be small in stature and grow well in controlled environments with artificial light			0
plants such as peppers and tomatoes are already extensively grown hydroponically , while lettuce , with its short lifecycle , would yield fast returns for pioneering space colonists			2
but again , @entity55 sees the choice of crops as part of an evolutionary process			0
he tells @entity0 , " the first things you might grow would be perishable foods -- maybe vegetables or fruits -- things that do n't keep very well if you 're on a journey to @entity72			0
even though you 're not providing a lot of calories , these things could have a strong impact in terms of adding color , flavor and texture to the diet			0
" " the other reason for considering freshly consumed foods on early missions is that they do n't require any processing , " he continued			2
" if you were to grow grains , like wheat , you 'd have to thresh the seed out of the head , then clean it and mill it to make flour			0
@entity174 crops like wheat , soy bean , rice and potato -- things that would provide carbohydrates , protein and fat -- they 're the final end point			2
" crops need a sheltered environment , protected from the extreme temperatures and frightening levels of radiation found on the moon 's surface , with water , carbon dioxide and light			2
researchers at the @entity196 's @entity195 ( @entity195 ) , in collaboration with @entity198 ( @entity199 ) , have come up with one solution : to house plants and astronauts in an inflatable habitat			1
they are working on a full - scale prototype @entity205			1
space - worthy inflatable structures have been around since the 1960s and are lightweight , compact in transit and easy to assemble on landing			1
but what 's novel about the @entity195 design is that it incorporates a bio-regenerative life - support system -- the kind of technology that could one day not only feed an outpost on the moon or @entity72 , but also provide it with oxygen and recycle its water			1
@entity221 , director of @entity195 , told @entity0 , " if people get to @entity72 we want to be able to feed them , but maybe even more importantly revitalize the atmosphere -- allow the plants to consume the carbon dioxide as they do so well here on @entity43 , and provide oxygen			1
" in the prototype designed by @entity232 ( @entity199 ) and evaluated by @entity221 and graduate student @entity233 , plants are grown hydroponically			1
as water evaporates from their leaves , air moisture is condensed and re-used for irrigation			0
the inedible bits of plants , the stems and leaves , are fed into a composter that breaks down the biomass , releasing carbon dioxide that can be re-used by growing plants			0
in a working moon base , waste water from the astronauts ' showers and laundry could also go into the composter , where it would be cleaned by microbes and then used in the plants ' hydroponic system , before being condensed and re-used by the astronauts once again			1
the @entity195 team intends to test the finished prototype in @entity258 , a harsh and remote environment that provides a realistic analog of conditions on the moon			1
the team has already provided a food growth chamber for the @entity264 and the time @entity232 and @entity233 have spent there has provided a unique insight into some of the other benefits that bio-regenerative life support might provide for inhabitants of a space base			1
" it 's not just oxygen , fresh water and food that it provides , but it 's also the green , living plants that psychologically become so important to people living and working in a confined , harsh , black and white space at the @entity281 or in a moon or @entity72 base , " says @entity221			1
@entity233 adds , " @entity284 , high humidity , green plants and the fragrance as well -- these are things that are missing in that environment			0
those things should n't be underestimated			0
" the @entity195 project offers a tantalizing glimpse of the kind of habitat that may house settlers in the space colonies of the future			1
and perhaps one day , as you relax in your inflatable villa by the @entity300 , plants will provide much more than just your dinner			0

do you think farming on the moon will be a reality by 2024 ? should man be developing stations on the moon ? send us your thoughts by using the " @entity310 " below .			2
