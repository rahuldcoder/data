-- it 's not surprising there 's speculation that @entity4 might run for the @entity5 â € ” although one should note that at this point , that 's all it is : speculation â € ” made mainly in a @entity10 article written by @entity11 , editor of the website @entity13			1
the fact is , however , @entity4 is a highly effective and popular public figure and would make a gifted elected leader			2
we should remember that before @entity19 's presidency , @entity4 was perhaps even more of a superstar than her husband			2
an accomplished attorney , she was an assistant to the mayor of @entity24 in the early 1990s , as well as an assistant commissioner of planning and development for the city			2
after running the @entity24 branch of the nonprofit @entity30 , which gets young people engaged in nonprofit and government leadership , @entity4 moved to the @entity33 , eventually rising to be vice president of the university 's extensive hospitals network			2
in our unequal country where so many people are vastly and unfairly underpaid , income certainly is n't an accurate measure of talent			0
but it certainly is often a good measure of power			0
in 2006 , sen. @entity19 reported a salary of $ 157,082			0
the same year , @entity4 's salary was $ 273,618			1
as first lady , @entity4 has managed to be both iconic and accessible , a hard - to - achieve but quintessential balancing act for the greatest of political leaders			0
she has taken on the important issues of child nutrition and obesity , as well as the challenges facing our nation 's military families			1
and on both issues , her unflagging leadership and unimpeachable achievements have been clear			0
but no doubt the speculation about @entity4 's next steps is partly related to this : voters who enthusiastically supported her husband 's campaign have been disillusioned by the messiness of governance , largely due to the unprecedented hostility of the @entity70 , but certainly made worse by president @entity4 's inability to outmaneuver his opponents either in rhetoric or in legislation			2
all that hope and change can fizzle in the face of reality , but @entity4 still seems full of the same optimism that once drove voters to the polls			0
moreover , those of us who often long to see president @entity4 be more confrontational , or even angry and aggressive , sometimes see more of that raw fighting spirit in his wife			0
should she someday choose to run for office , @entity4 may prove an even more gifted politician than her husband , especially when it comes to dodging the incoming attacks and getting things done			0
all the buzzing around @entity95 's potential presidential run ca n't help but encourage the speculation about @entity4 , the prospect of another first lady running for the @entity5 and maybe , someday , a higher office			1
it 's worth noting that @entity4 's approval ratings are higher than @entity95 's were when she was first lady			1
@entity4 's approval ratings are also higher than her husband 's			1
the political stars might certainly be aligned : sen. @entity103 of @entity104 is a @entity70 in the @entity107 ' @entity106 home state and would be up for re-election in november 2016 , just as the @entity4 @entity13 would be drawing to an end			0
should @entity4 choose to run , she would be a formidable candidate in every way , from public speaking to fundraising to policy to media and more			1
but either way , just the fact that anyone is speculating sends a flattering signal to a beloved first lady who @entity119 would clearly like to keep in the public eye .			1

@entity122 : @entity123 notes @entity4 's recent higher profile . does it presage @entity5 run ?
why not ? she says . before becoming first lady , she was accomplished attorney
@entity122 says she 's been effective *advocate* on nutrition , military families ; her approval rating high
@entity122 : she *'d* be a formidable candidate , and @entity119 seems to like to see her in public eye
