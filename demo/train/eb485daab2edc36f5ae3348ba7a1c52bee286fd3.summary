a man who @entity4 authorities tried to have indicted in connection with the kidnapping and killing of a nursing student has committed suicide , his attorney told @entity9 on tuesday			1
the investigation into the killing of @entity13 has not been smooth			1
the suicide of @entity15 is the latest twist			1
@entity17 , a 20 - year - old nursing student , disappeared in april 2011			2
her remains were not found until last september , in @entity20			2
@entity15 was never indicted , but was in prosecutors ' sights and was threatened with possible charges			1
two other men -- @entity25 and @entity26 -- are charged with especially aggravated kidnapping and first - degree murder in @entity17 's killing			0
both have pleaded not guilty			0
@entity32 's role in the case , according to attorney @entity34 , was to cooperate with authorities in exchange for immunity from prosecution			1
days after @entity32 was granted immunity in march 2014 , the state tried to void the deal and tried at least twice to indict @entity32 , his attorney said			1
as a result , @entity34 filed a civil breach of contract suit against the state , asking the court to enforce the immunity deal as well as a restraining order to prevent the state from further attempts at indictment			1
that case is pending in circuit court , @entity34 said			0
the state said it revoked the immunity agreement because @entity32 was not being truthful or fully cooperative , @entity9 affiliate @entity54 reported			1
@entity34 told the affiliate that his client always maintained that he had nothing to do with @entity17 's death			1
@entity17 's brother told authorities he saw a man in camouflage leading @entity17 away from their home in @entity66 in april 2011			0
volunteers from at least five counties searched for the student , and donors raised more than $ 450,000 in reward money to help find whoever was responsible			0
investigators ruled out early reports that @entity17 had been dragged away from her home , but they did n't believe she left of her own free will , either			0
" we feel she was in fear of her life so she was compliant with his demands , " a @entity80 ( @entity81 ) special agent said at the time			0
@entity17 was on her way to school when she disappeared			0
@entity89 and @entity26 were indicted in march 2014			0
information from " several witnesses " led to charges against them , the head of the @entity81 said then			0
investigators " believe there are more people with information and possible involvement , " the @entity81 said			0
months later , in december , the @entity81 announced that it was withdrawing from the investigation			2
in a statement , the agency said that the district attorney accused the tbi of misconduct , along with other law enforcement agencies			2
at the district attorney 's request , the @entity81 stopped its investigation			1
but shortly afterward , the @entity81 resumed its work on the @entity17 case after the district attorney took himself off the case and appointed a special prosecutor to handle it , according to the @entity114 @entity9 's @entity115 contributed to this report .			2
