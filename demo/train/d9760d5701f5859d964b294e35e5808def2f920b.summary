the sinkhole -- about 20 feet wide and 50 to 60 feet deep -- was still expanding , they said , and the suburban @entity62 house could collapse at any time			1
authorities made the heartbreaking decision to stop the search for @entity56 after the odds against his survival became abundantly clear			1
" we just have not been able to locate mr. @entity56 , and so for that reason , the rescue effort is being discontinued , " @entity27 told reporters saturday evening			1

... this is one step at a time , because we really do n't know what we 're dealing with here , " @entity27 said sunday morning			0
sinkholes are common in the state , according to the @entity165			0
@entity5 lies on bedrock made of limestone or other carbonate rock that can be eaten away by acidic groundwater , forming voids that collapse when the rock can no longer support the weight of what 's above it			1
@entity28 , on @entity5 's west coast , is part of an area known as " sinkhole alley " that accounts for two thirds of the sinkhole - related insurance claims in the state , according to a @entity5 state @entity183 and @entity185 report			1

nearby homes were evacuated friday as a precaution			0
the family that lived next door was given about 30 minutes to grab belongings before abandoning the house , which was compromised by the sinkhole , fire department spokesman @entity196 said			1
though the risky search for @entity56 has ended , the danger has not			1
@entity27 said workers were dealing with a " very unusual sinkhole " -- deep , wide and extremely unstable			2
" it 's underground , it 's unseen and we 're uncertain as to what 's under there , " said @entity207 , the county 's director of public works			1
" so we 'll be very cautious going in			0
" contractors will finish demolition work on monday , he said			2
" they 'll pull out the rest of the structure , load it up and take it away			0
" but authorities said @entity56 's body will remain in its final resting place , trapped underground where the house his family lived in for generations once stood			1
