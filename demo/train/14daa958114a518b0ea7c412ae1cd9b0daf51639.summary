@entity0 -- " hurry up , " one of my rivals curtly warns me , as i clumsily try to decide which tile to add to my deck			2
@entity7 does n't seem to realize that part of my dawdling is because i 'm learning to play the @entity11 game @entity12 for the very first time			1
coached by my colleague , @entity1 producer @entity14 , i reach for a number			0
then , in an effort to create some goodwill , i buy a glass of @entity11 tea and send it over to @entity7 's side of the table			1
" thanks , " he writes			0
but i still proceed to lose the game			0
instead of playing @entity12 the traditional way , shuffling plastic numbered ties on a green - felt table in a smoky cafe , @entity30 and i are exploring the game digitally			1
this online version of @entity12 lets you win digital dollars and play with your friends via @entity35			1
it is definitely designed for a @entity11 audience : among the gifts you can send people are @entity11 coffee , a nargila water pipe , and even a belly dancer			1
there is also a function called " flÃ ¶ rt " that lets you flirt with other players			2
it is a fairly simple formula that the game 's online designers say has been wildly successful			0
since @entity11 start - up company @entity50 released @entity12 less than two years ago , the game has attracted more than 19 million users , with an average of more than 3 million players a month			1
" we 're only 2 years old , " says @entity54 , one of @entity50 ' founders			1
the @entity57 - educated former investment banker then rattles off accomplishments that would make any entrepreneur jealous			0
" we started with three people , and now we 're with 200			0
five offices around the world , 10 million daily and 30 million monthly active users , to be the third - largest gaming company in the world			1
" an intense work force @entity67 speaks in the company 's offices , which overlook @entity0 's @entity70			0
ferry boats glide past the window , as employees stare intently at banks of computer monitors			0
the age of the work force here looks to be in the mid- 20s , and the dress code is casual			0
but the atmosphere is pretty serious			0
i 'm struck by how clearly i can hear the sound of clicking mouse buttons			0
it is n't easy to independently confirm some of @entity50 ' claims			1
the young company does not reveal its revenues			0
as @entity89 , a @entity91 gaming industry consultant and columnist explains to me , there is a culture of secrecy within the online gaming industry			2
" this is a very young market , and there are people who are treating it as a gold rush and there are others who are saying ' listen , you have to build something sustainable , ' " @entity89 says in a phone call from @entity91			2
regardless where @entity50 falls in this ongoing debate , it is clear that the @entity11 start - up has quickly become a significant player in the online gaming industry			1
according to the application tracker @entity114 , @entity113 's 23 games have a total of more than 22 million monthly active users			1
that puts @entity50 within the world 's @entity120 most popular application designers			1
targeting an overlooked market part of @entity113 's successful strategy appears to be that it has focused on a region apparently overlooked by many of the world 's more established game designers			2
" we just saw there were huge opportunities around the @entity11 and @entity133 speaking market , " explains @entity67			1
" we realized that there was so much demand , so much usage and internet consumption , but not enough local content and local games			0
" with more than 31 million users , @entity11 is the world 's seventh - largest @entity35 country , according to @entity142 , another social media tracking company			1
@entity50 first targeted this enormous @entity11 market by " localizing " games that had been designed for foreign audiences and converting some @entity11 traditional games such as @entity12 to the digital realm			1
statistically , @entity113 claims one in five @entity11 @entity35 users has now played @entity12			1
less than a year after its launch , @entity50 expanded its operations to the @entity153 world			1
the company established an office in @entity156 , @entity157 , and this year acquired a @entity160 online game designing company			0
half of the company 's millions of consumers now log on from the @entity133 speaking world			0
bridging a cultural divide @entity89 , who writes columns for @entity167 , credits the ambitious @entity11 start - up with getting a head start in @entity171 markets			1
" the rest of the world does n't really engage with these markets because it 's hard			0
selling games to @entity178 or @entity91 or @entity179 people is very easy , because it was figured out in the 1990s , " @entity89 says			0
" if you 've got a country that can organize a revolution over @entity188 and one of the first things the government does when people get grumpy is it turns off the @entity193 , " @entity89 adds , referring to the 2011 revolution in @entity182 , " that should have been a wake - up call for business people			0
" @entity67 agrees it is n't always easy to translate games designed for @entity178 teenagers for an audience in , say , @entity160			0
" the @entity133 region and @entity133 culture is even more difficult than @entity11 to understand and penetrate , because of the cultural differences , religious differences , even the way that the alphabet works and the language works is different , " she says			2
to avoid triggering religious taboos in @entity153 markets , for example , @entity50 had to transform a game character named @entity210 from an ancient @entity182 deity to a " hero			1
" on the other hand , @entity50 has gambled that online gaming will likely grow in the @entity153 world , in part because it provides conservative @entity171 societies with an easy , alternative way to socialize			1
" it 's not as easy in a lot of these countries to go up to a bar or a cafe and meet someone and have a meaningful conversation , " she says			2
" these games provide a platform and a medium to talk to others without being shunned or looked down upon			0
" barring linguistic divisions , the online gaming world effectively has no borders			2
as a result , designers at @entity113 's @entity0 offices have made some cultural observations , while monitoring game play of participants from different countries			2
in the hard - core , empire - building strategy game @entity243 , for example , designer @entity241 said @entity179 players tended to focus on teamwork within their alliances , whereas @entity153 players were " the most competitive " and @entity11 were " in the biggest rush to make the biggest army			1
" @entity113 is now in the process of designing a new strategy game , " @entity253			0
" its slightly cartoonish cast of warrior characters includes a @entity257 sapper , a @entity259 hunter , an @entity261 janissary and the legendary @entity261 aviator @entity262			0
tailing @entity264 : 007 locations muslim for a month : tourists take @entity270 ' pray - cations ' turning social activism into a game more on gaming at @entity1 's @entity273 ! @entity1 's @entity14 contributed to this report			2

@entity50 released @entity12 less than two years ago ; it has more than 19 million users
@entity12 lets you win digital dollars and play with your friends via @entity35
@entity50 is attempting to turn @entity11 and @entity153 countries into a *lucrative* gaming market
