-- answers remain in short supply as to why an unarmed teenager was shot and killed two weeks ago			1
@entity4 , 17 , was walking toward the home of his father 's fiancee in a gated community in @entity9 , @entity10 , around sunset on february 26			1
the neighborhood watch captain , 28 - year - old @entity12 , saw the teen on the property and called 911			1
according to @entity0 affiliate @entity15 , @entity12 , who is white , described @entity4 to a dispatcher as a suspicious black man			1
@entity9 police chief @entity19 said the 911 dispatcher told @entity12 not to confront @entity4 , but by the time police arrived , the teenager lay dead with a gunshot wound in the chest			1
he was carrying a small amount of cash , some candy and an iced tea			0
@entity12 told police he shot @entity4 in self - defense , but that does n't sit well with @entity4 's parents			1
" when you add it up , it just does n't even make sense , " said @entity32 , the @entity4 family 's attorney			1
" @entity4 , a kid , has a bag of @entity39			1
( @entity12 ) had a 9 mm gun			0
@entity4 did n't approach @entity12 , @entity12 approached @entity4			1
so how can he now assert self - defense ? " police say a gunshot can be heard on the 911 calls recorded that night			1
@entity9 police said monday the calls will not be made public until the investigation is complete , but the @entity4 family is pushing for the tapes to be released sooner			2
" it will tell us why ( @entity12 ) just disregarded , just ignored the police instructions when they tell him to stay put , they 'll be there in a few minutes			0
on those 911 tapes is going to tell you why he said he 's not going to follow their instructions			0
and most importantly , it 's going to tell us his mentality when he confronted this 17 - year - old kid , " @entity32 said			2
numerous attempts to contact @entity12 by @entity0 were unsuccessful , and it is unclear whether @entity12 has retained an attorney			0
under intense pressure from the community , city officials in @entity9 held a press conference on monday			2
" we are going to complete a thorough and fair investigation and present all the information to the state attorney 's office so justice can be rendered , " @entity19 said			0
police said they have not charged @entity12 because there are no grounds to disprove his story of what happened			0
" the evidence and testimony we have so far does not establish that mr. @entity12 did not act in self - defense			1
we do n't have anything to dispute his claim of self - defense , at this point , with the evidence and testimony that we have , " @entity19 said			1
@entity19 said the directions the 911 dispatcher gave @entity12 to not accost @entity4 when the incident arose were not mandatory instructions			2
" that is a call taker making a recommendation to him			0
he 's not under a legal obligation to do that , so that is not something we can charge him with			0
but it would have been a good outcome ... if @entity4 and @entity12 never came in contact with one another			2
" tensions are swelling in the black community over why @entity12 is free			0
" you 've got a little dead black boy , and the community sees you protecting the shooter , " one man said			0
an outraged woman said , " i 'm sure you 've heard the phrase , taking candy from a baby ? but this person , i 'm talking about every child , not just @entity4 , whether he 's black , white , blue , yellow or green , it is easy to take a candy from a baby			2
it 's been said over and over and over again , but this person did n't take the candy , he took the life and left the child			0
" @entity122 city manager @entity122 said he had personally extended condolences to the @entity4 family			1
" we see this as a tragedy			0
we are doing a full and thorough investigation , and certainly the guilty parties ... will be punished			0
