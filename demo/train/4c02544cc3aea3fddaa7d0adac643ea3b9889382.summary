@entity0 -- @entity3 foreign secretary @entity2 pledged thursday to help @entity4 improve human rights and boost stability , as rights groups and analysts warned that urgent action is needed to tackle the problem of lawless militia groups			1
@entity4 has achieved much in the year since the start of the popular uprisings that helped bring @entity15 's 42 - year rule to an end , @entity2 said in a statement , but challenges remain			1
chief among them is how to deal with the many armed groups that took part in the uprising and now continue to exercise power , analysts say			2
rights group @entity25 said in a report thursday that armed militias are committing human rights abuses with impunity , threatening to destabilize the country and hindering its efforts to rebuild			1
detainees at 10 facilities used by militia in central and western @entity4 told representatives from @entity25 this year that they had been tortured or abused , and at least 12 detainees held by militias have died after being tortured since september , the human rights group said			1
the @entity4 authorities have not effectively investigated the torture allegations , it added			1
@entity2 said @entity3 would host a conference in the spring to look at ways the government " can take urgent steps to implement commitments made on upholding human rights and ensure reports of detainee abuse are being addressed			1
" it will also provide " practical expertise to promote the rule of law , " he said , with @entity3 experts offering advice to the interior ministry , @entity4 police and lawyers			1
@entity3 will also fund a six - month program to engage young people in civic society , @entity2 said			2
" the work to rebuild @entity4 is just beginning and there are undoubtedly challenges ahead			1
but it is important to remember what has been achieved , " he said			0
however , the armed groups -- mostly made up of young men without regular jobs -- are showing little inclination to give up their weapons , analysts say			0
@entity71 , an analyst for the @entity0 - based think tank @entity72 , said the militias were one of the main challenges the @entity76 , the country 's transitional government , now faces as it tries to extend its authority			1
" they are far more important than alleged remnants of @entity84 forces -- there are more of them , they can legitimately claim that they helped in the revolution , and indeed they can argue that they did more to remove @entity15 in practical terms than the lawyers and academics that are running the @entity76 , " she told @entity1 via e-mail			0
@entity71 said militia members now need jobs if they are to be integrated into civic society			0
" most of those jobs will probably have to come from the public sector in the first instance , as @entity4 is an extremely state - dominated economy , " she said , adding that an estimated 70 % of the workforce is employed by the state at present			2
" of course , westerners are advising @entity4 to focus on diversifying the economy away from oil and reduce dependence on the public sector , but realistically the experience of other oil exporters in the region suggests this will take a long time , " she said			2
however , the government has made faster progress than many expected in terms of restoring the functioning of the economy , she said , and oil money could help with the reintegration of former fighters			0
@entity119 , a senior analyst at the @entity120 and a former leader of the @entity122 , which aimed to overthrow @entity15 , said everything he has heard suggests the militia groups have no real intention of laying down their arms			0
the thousands of militia members countrywide do not view the @entity76 as being a legitimate political entity , he said			0
as a result , they argue that they need their weapons to ensure the future security of @entity4			2
meanwhile , the transitional government has done too little to speak to the @entity4 people and instill confidence in the mostly good work it is doing to establish a functioning state , @entity119 said			1
some militias are forming powerful coalition blocs , making it even harder for the defense and interior ministries to deal with them and enforce the rule of law , he said			0
@entity145 , a senior fellow at the @entity146 and former senior adviser on the @entity148 at the @entity149 , agrees that some of the competing regional militias have more power than the government itself			2
they are using that power " for extortion , for settling scores , tribal or personal , or otherwise generally for asserting their control over parts of the country , " he said			0
he believes the @entity4 government needs to strengthen the centralized military , while at the same time devolving some civic power to the tribal and regional groups and spending oil money to aid development outside the capital			1
this would help to defuse the long - standing tensions that exist between @entity171 and regional power bases , he said			0
the authorities ' efforts to integrate militia members into a regular national army were a good step , he said , but much harder to achieve in practice than in theory			2
@entity145 also points out that while any abuse is unwelcome , the large - scale atrocities committed under the @entity15 regime were far worse than what is now being reported			0
@entity185 , an associate fellow at the @entity186 ( @entity186 ) , a @entity3 - based think tank , argues that the transitional government had few options when it assumed power			0
it lacked the military capability or the cohesion to take on the militias after the fall of @entity15 's regime , he told @entity1 , and still lacks the capacity to force them to disband			1
" it 's obviously a major problem that we have abuses committed on this scale ... but at the same time there 's nothing @entity4 can really do , " he said			1
" all they can really do at the moment is take on some of the most egregious violations , some of the people who have committed abuses on the biggest scale			2
" a form of post-conflict justice is also needed , so that those militia members who have committed major abuses do not end up in positions of power , he said			0
the dangers of allowing armed leaders to assume power in a new government can be seen in the experiences of @entity221 and @entity222 , @entity185 said			2
" @entity4 should n't allow these people to have a free pass , " he said			2
" even if they ca n't be taken on or disarmed , they can at least be disempowered			0
" the @entity227 , @entity228 and other international bodies could aid the @entity4 authorities by imposing financial and travel sanctions on those who commit abuses , he added			1
the international community is guilty of taking its eye off the ball in @entity4 , @entity145 said , and must ensure it backs up the struggling ntc or risk watching @entity4 " tip toward more violence instead of getting gradually better			2
" a spokesman for the @entity241 told @entity1 wednesday that civilian leaders in @entity4 must do more to assert their authority , holding accountable militia members who perpetrate abuses			1
" if the @entity4 state is being built , these guys who committed this need to be brought to justice , whether they are revolutionary fighters or not , otherwise the whole world will ask , ' what changed in @entity4 ? ' the same systemic abuse and torture is continuing , and this is dangerous for the new @entity4 , " council spokesman @entity246 said			1
" the only solution is for the government to take over			0
you can not let these guys keep holding the prisoners			0
" civilian authorities have been slow to step in , @entity246 said , even though some prisoners have been held for months without facing official charges			0
" when you talk to the government they say , ' keep them , we do n't have time yet , ' and this is wrong , " he said			0
a process for government takeovers of prisons has begun , @entity4 's interim prime minister said in a televised address last month			1
@entity4 's ambassador to the @entity274 , @entity273 , told the world body last month that @entity4 does not approve of any abuse of detainees and was working to stop any such practices			1
@entity4 interior minister @entity279 told @entity1 this month that the country 's interim government had not yet succeeded in integrating militias from different cities into a national security force			1
other organizations have also raised concerns about the militias			0
the medical charity @entity288 said last month it was halting its work in detention centers in @entity291 because detainees were tortured and were denied urgent medical care			0
@entity294 said earlier this month that the torture and killing of detainees is an ongoing practice among @entity4 militias and will continue unless the militias are held to account			1
@entity1 's @entity301 contrbuted to this report .			0
