@entity0 told an audience in @entity3 on monday that her new mission in life was to end cyberbullying			1
her speech -- and her goal -- come as the former @entity10 intern steps into the public eye after years of trying to live privately			1
" having survived myself , what i want to do now is help other victims of the shame game survive , too , " she told the audience at @entity13 ' 30 under 30 summit			1
" i want to put my suffering to good use and give purpose to my past			2
" @entity0 , who as an intern in 1995 had an affair with president @entity23 , said she was " patient zero " of online harassment			1
" there was no @entity27 , @entity28 or @entity29 back then , " she said			1
" but there were gossip , news and entertainment websites replete with comment sections and emails which could be forwarded			2
of course , it was all done on the excruciatingly slow dial up			2
yet around the world this story went			2
a viral phenomenon that , you could argue , was the first moment of truly ' social media '			0
" @entity0 became emotional when describing the months after her 1998 scandal with the president , when national attention was fixed on her			1
" staring at the computer screen , i spent the day shouting : ' oh my god ! ' and ' i ca n't believe they put that in ' or ' that 's so out of context , ' " she said			0
" and those were the only thoughts that interrupted a relentless mantra in my head : ' i want to die			0
' " @entity0 also recapped her affair with @entity23			2
" sixteen years ago , fresh out of college , a 22 year old intern in the @entity10 -- and more than averagely romantic -- i fell in love with my boss in a 22 - year old sort of way			0
it happens , " @entity0 said			2
" but my boss was the president of the @entity66			0
that probably happens less often			0
now i deeply regret it for many reasons , not the least of which is that people were hurt			0
and that is never okay			0
" the former @entity10 intern -- who since has received a masters from the @entity75 and tried her hand as a purse designer -- said the affair was " my everything			0
" @entity0 , however , struck a resilient tone , according to @entity13 , and focused on what she wants to do going forward : end cyberbullying			1
the former @entity10 intern has said in past interviews and essays that she feels a connection with people who have been caught up in online scandals that forever changed their lives			0
in a may @entity90 piece , where she discussed life after her affair with @entity23 , @entity0 cited the 2010 @entity94 case as the reason she was going public with her cause			1
@entity98 was a freshman at @entity99 who committed suicide after his roommate secretly used a webcam to stream his sexual encounter			0
" my own suffering took on a different meaning , " @entity0 wrote about her reaction to the @entity98 case			1
" perhaps by sharing my story , i reasoned , i might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation			0
the question became : how do i find and give a purpose to my past ? " in the piece , @entity0 said her new goal was to " get involved with efforts on behalf of victims of online humiliation and harassment and to start speaking on this topic in public forums			1
" @entity0 's speech comes on the same day that she joined @entity28 , a move that is just the latest step in @entity0 's re-entry into public life .			1
