-- you could have gotten very good odds had you predicted at the beginning of 2013 , when @entity4 took office as secretary of state , that he would end up having the most successful year of anyone in the @entity10 administration or , indeed , @entity11			1
@entity4 was an old familiar face , a man whose moment had come and gone with his presidential candidacy in 2004			2
he was following in the footsteps of the most popular politician in @entity18 in an administration not famous for giving its @entity21 members much of the limelight that was jealously guarded for the president			2
he also was going to be thrust into an international situation in which the problems ranged from intractable to almost incomprehensible at a time when the people of the @entity18 had precious little interest in overseas engagement			1
yet here we are a year later and @entity4 is widely regarded as having transcended himself , his job , the limitations placed on him by the @entity33 , and the challenges of the world scene			1
he is viewed as a man who has effectively built on the work @entity38 did to restore diplomacy to the center of @entity18 foreign policy and , in fact , as a greater risk taker than she was			1
he has shown creativity , tenacity , the courage to stand up to leaders overseas and his would - be minders in the administration and has won widespread kudos for it			2
one very senior @entity54 diplomat on tuesday described him to me as a " national treasure " for the @entity18			0
and this is someone who has many issues with the @entity18 ' handling of crises in @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			1
another leader from the same region described the @entity69 peace process as the " most remarkable effort i have seen in my lifetime			0
" within the @entity75 , while he is not given top grades as a manager of that big bureaucracy , he is seen as a force of nature , as someone who is willing the department into the central role that for the past decade was primarily occupied by the @entity81 in shaping @entity18 international priorities			1
some of the change in the role of diplomacy is , of course , a result of shifting away from a war footing in @entity64 and @entity88 , withdrawing our troops and thus making military action less central to our initiatives in the @entity54			2
but that could just as easily have created a void			0
yet @entity4 stepped in and from the beginning astonished everyone with his appetite to tackle the @entity99 - @entity69 issue , his nimbleness in turning missteps in @entity63 into a chemical deal that would have been hard to imagine months earlier and his stewardship of the administration 's @entity65 nuclear negotiations			1
some characterized him as a dreamer early on , a @entity108			0
but with the progress that has already been achieved on all three fronts , it is impossible not to see him as making a significant impactâ € ” largely by virtue of his tireless travel schedule , his mastery of the facts and his force of personality			0
of course , it is just a year that has transpired			0
while expectations for the @entity4 tenure at @entity75 may have started low , he has raised them considerably			0
now all eyes are on these three deals to see what happens			0
will there be an @entity65 deal ? if so , will it be a good one that the @entity129 and our allies can accept or will it strengthen @entity65 without gaining real peace of mind for the @entity18 and our allies in the region ? will the @entity63 chemical deal , which the @entity18 has complained is not resulting in the elimination of weapons fast enough , ultimately deliver on its original goals ? or will it continue to serve , as president @entity10 's own top intelligence official recently asserted , to strengthen the regime of @entity144 ? opinion : are @entity63 , @entity65 playing @entity10 for a fool ? and what benefit will a chemical weapons deal achieve if @entity63 continues to fester and serve as both a killing field and a training ground for an unprecedented number of extremists ? can progress be made between @entity99 and the @entity154 ? even with the sniping that @entity4 is receiving from top officials in the @entity99 government ? even with the divisions among the @entity154 ? and what of the decay in @entity64 ? the possibility that the same will occur in @entity88 when the @entity18 leaves or that in leaving there , we will also become less capable of fighting terrorism in @entity166 ? what of the shape - shifting and spread of @entity170 and similar extremist groups ? and what of the rest of the world that feels that the @entity18 is once again focused almost exclusively on the @entity54 even as large emerging markets are buffeted by crisis , @entity172 is rocked by wars , and our alliances are in desperate need of modernization ? no , while @entity4 has had a remarkable year and has been an invaluable asset for the @entity18 , he and his team know well that their toughest work lies ahead			1
his legacy and that of the president he serves will be determined less by the considerable progress of the past year and much more by whether the opportunities he has helped create can be capitalized upon in the time between now and the end of 2016			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			0

@entity195 : many *doubted* @entity4 would succeed against tough odds
but after a year as secretary of state , he 's had *surprising* success , says @entity195
he says @entity4 made progress on restoring diplomacy as central to @entity18 role overseas
@entity195 : @entity209 legacy is whether @entity65 , @entity63 , @entity99 - @entity154 talks bear fruit
