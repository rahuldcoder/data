@entity0 , @entity1 -- health and safety concerns about @entity5 nuclear power plants after this month 's earthquake and tsunami have @entity8 wondering what could happen across the street from her own house in her @entity13 suburb			1
@entity8 , who is a registered nurse , has lived for nearly a decade with her husband and two children in the shadow of the @entity18 nuclear energy facility in @entity0 , about 20 miles northwest of @entity13			2
since long before the @entity5 disaster , @entity8 's unique neighborhood landmark has been the source of family jokes			0
" we kid around when we get really big flowers ... we 're under the power plant , and i kid around that i glow , " laughed @entity8 as she held her baby @entity23 in sight of the plant 's giant twin cooling towers			1
in all seriousness , she said , all the @entity33 are happy and healthy			0
" we have nothing going on different " from anyone else despite their nuclear neighbors			2
but @entity8 did express concern when she learned that new scientific data show a slightly higher risk that the plant may be damaged during a powerful earthquake , according to a report by the @entity45			1
" should something occur , they would warn us , " @entity8 said			1
" i kind of figure we 're all in the same boat			0
" radiation : what you need to know the power plant has sent information to surrounding residents that shows how to prepare for a nuclear emergency , @entity8 said , but she admitted her family has not prepared an at - home emergency kit			1
" we would just sort of put them together if we had to evacuate , " @entity8 said			0
the risk of a quake - related nuclear accident , experts say , is comparatively low because the facility is rated to withstand levels of seismic movement that are rare for the region			1
based on @entity71 seismic data from 1989 , the @entity45 report estimated the annual risk of quake - related damage to the nuclear core at the @entity18 plant to be relatively remote -- once in about 50,000 years			1
but updated research increased the chances of quake damage slightly			1
according to the @entity45 report , 2008 seismic hazard estimates from the @entity71 indicate the annual risk of damage to the core at about once in 20,000 years			1
" the chances of damage are extremely remote , but engineers compare two very remote risks to understand their relative meaning , " said @entity82 , a consulting engineer with the @entity45 and the @entity83 for the firm @entity84			2
" getting into your car and driving on a freeway poses a risk that everyone realizes could result in a fatal crash , but the chances are so remote that we decide to take that risk			0
" how close are you to a @entity100 nuclear plant ? @entity18 operator @entity101 released a statement recently expressing confidence that its " nuclear facilities are equipped with numerous and redundant safety systems designed to protect them against earthquakes , flooding and other natural disasters			1
" although @entity8 's concerns about earthquakes have risen after the march 11 disaster , the troubles with @entity5 's @entity112 nuclear power plant are n't directly blamed on the quake , but on the devastating tsunami that followed it			1
after the 9.0 - magnitude quake hit , the tsunami cut off power to systems that cooled nuclear fuel			1
virtually landlocked @entity1 is not in a danger zone for tsunamis			2
@entity126 geoscience professor @entity125 said a similar quake in this region is very unlikely			2
" there 's very , very little earthquake activity here , " he said			0
" in some areas , there are lots of very , very small earthquakes , but the energy they release is very , very minimal			0
" on wednesday , the @entity45 announced it would review programs and regulations in light of the @entity5 troubles to ensure protection of public health and safety			2
@entity100 nuclear agency launches safety task force as for @entity8 , she does n't anticipate an earthquake near her home anytime soon			1
but if something does happen , she said , " we 're going to be the first ones to find out			0
" for some , @entity18 's towering structures provide a reliable directional beacon for @entity0 's 22,377 residents , as they make their way to the local outlet shopping mall with its @entity159 and @entity160 stores and a new @entity162 grocery store not far away			0
but the towers also remind residents that nuclear power comes with risks that are very different from traditional fossil fuel - burning plants			1
in a national @entity2 / @entity170 poll of @entity100 who live near nuclear power plants , nearly 60 % said it 's unlikely that a disaster or accident would put their families in immediate danger			1
in addition , nearly 60 % of poll respondents said they did n't think local emergency services were prepared to handle that kind of situation			0
see details about the poll the same poll also suggests that most @entity100 living near nuclear power plants have n't prepared disaster supply kits			1
tour a @entity189 nuclear power facility @entity8 said she 's generally comfortable with her community 's preparedness			1
" all the local schools , they all have evacuation plans and they tell you where your child will be evacuated to			0
" but public reaction to an emergency is something that gives @entity8 pause			0
" i honestly would be afraid that there would be some mass panic -- mass exodus -- and the highways and the roads would get pretty congested and blocked , and i think it potentially could be chaotic			0
" nukes protected from big disaster costs the @entity18 plant , which first went online in 1986 , can keep electricity flowing to more than 2 million homes , its website says			2
it 's awaiting @entity45 approval to increase its capacity , and the plant 's owners intend to apply for a 20 - year extension to its operating license			2
in a statement , @entity222 , @entity101 chairman and ceo , said his company 's " plants are safe , particularly given the different seismic patterns in our regions and the absence of tsunami - type events where we have operations			2
" congressional supporters of nuclear power , like sen. @entity234 , @entity235 , have expressed interest in slowing down the permitting process for new nuclear power plants in the @entity100 until more information is known about the troubles at the @entity5 facilities			1
nuke lobbyists scramble on @entity243 @entity222 's statement said , " ... we watch , we learn , and we will work with the @entity45 and other policymakers , as well as industry colleagues , on what , if anything , should be done to apply what can be learned from " events in @entity5			0
far from @entity243 , perhaps nowhere is the nuclear reminder taller and more in - your - face than at @entity8 's home , which is dwarfed by @entity18 's twin towers			0
when she looks out the living room window of her cozy home , they are just a couple of football fields away from her front door			0
@entity8 says she 's not planning any major changes in light of the @entity45 report and the events in @entity5			0
" let 's just say i 'm not gon na pack up and leave tomorrow			0

@entity1 mom concerned about a nuclear power plant across the street
agency : chance of yearly quake core damage *upgraded* to 1 in *18,868* , *vs.* 1 in *45,455* before
new data also affects other @entity100 nuclear power plants ; officials reviewing regulations
owner : plant is safe ; mom : " should something occur , they would warn us "
