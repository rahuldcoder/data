@entity1 officials have asked the @entity3 @entity2 to immediately block enforcement of a federal judge 's ruling allowing same - sex couples to be legally married in the state			1
an emergency appeal was filed on tuesday with justice @entity10 , who could rule herself or ask the rest of the court to weigh in			1
any action from the high court would be limited and temporary and would not be the final word on the constitutionality of the state 's ban on same - sex marriage			1
a @entity21 - based federal appeals court will take up the larger issues on an expedited basis in coming weeks , but in the meantime has allowed those marriages to take place			0
@entity10 told lawyers for a group of gay and lesbian couples who brought the initial legal challenge to respond to the state 's latest appeal by noon friday			0
the @entity2 could then issue an order on the enforcement question			0
@entity3 district court judge @entity35 struck down @entity1 's ban on same - sex marriage on december 20 , saying the law conflicted with equal protection and due process guarantees under the @entity3 @entity41			1
@entity1 voters approved a law banning same - sex marriage in 2004			1
@entity35 's ruling drew national attention partly because @entity1 is viewed as being among the more conservative states and because the @entity3 @entity2 just ruled this past summer on separate issues involving same - sex marriage			1
in june , the nation 's highest court cleared the way for same - sex marriages in @entity52 to resume after it ruled private parties did not have " standing " to defend @entity52 's voter - approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state - sanctioned wedlock			1
the justices also rejected parts of the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) in a 5 - 4 decision , concluding same - sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits such as tax breaks			0
in the @entity1 case , the state argued tuesday that numerous same - sex marriages " are now occurring " daily in @entity1 as a result of the district court decision			2
" and each one is an affront not only to the interests of the states and its citizens in being able to define marriage through ordinary democratic channels , but also to this ( high ) court 's unique role as final arbiter of the profoundly important question it so carefully preserved " in the @entity60 case , the state said			0
the federal judge 's ruling prompted a rush of same - sex couples to courthouses in @entity1 where they obtained marriage licenses , despite the state 's ongoing legal challenge			1
@entity1 gov. @entity95 had criticized @entity35 's ruling , calling him " an activist federal judge			2
" @entity35 , appointed to the bench last year by president @entity98 , said the state 's " current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and , in so doing , demean the dignity of these same - sex couples for no rational reason			0
accordingly , the court finds that these laws are unconstitutional			0
