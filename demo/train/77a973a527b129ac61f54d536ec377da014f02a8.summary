-- @entity1 converted a penalty in time added on to give holders @entity5 a dramatic 4 - 3 win over @entity7 who filed an official complaint after their @entity11 opener at @entity12 on monday			1
@entity1 celebrates after his last - gasp penalty gives holders @entity5 an opening win in their @entity11 victory			1
substitute @entity17 was red - carded after handling on the goalline in a desperate attempt to deny @entity5 -- and @entity24 's recent $ 92million signing @entity1 rifled home from the spot for his second goal of the game			1
but the decision by @entity27 referee @entity26 to award the penalty upset @entity30 winners @entity7			2
they were unhappy that @entity26 initially blew for a corner but changed his mind after the fourth official , @entity35 's @entity34 , spoke to him after reportedly seeing television replays			0
" since when do the regulations say it is a penalty based on the monitors or on the television ? " asked @entity7 's deputy coach @entity37			2
" @entity7 is going to file a complaint against the penalty			2
" @entity5 coach @entity44 saw nothing wrong with the decision			0
" it was a clear case of a penalty , " he said , adding that his team let a two - goal lead slip because they were tired			0
" we had two tough ( @entity53 ) qualifiers , 23 hours of travel and the time difference			0
the players have not been sleeping well so obviously we are quite happy with the win			0
" substitute @entity58 scored a brace to help world champions @entity60 stage a second - half recovery against 10 - man @entity62 and claim a 3 - 1 victory in their tournament debut in @entity65			1
@entity66 are staging the tournament as a warm - up for next year 's @entity53 finals -- with @entity7 struggling to qualify for 2010 after their recent 3 - 1 defeat against @entity72			1
but it looked as though @entity7 were going to deny five - times world champions @entity5 an opening victory in their defense of the @entity11 crown after a fightback that saw @entity80 also score twice			1
@entity5 were leading 3 - 1 at halftime with first - half strikes from @entity1 ( 5 minutes ) , @entity83 ( 12 ) and @entity84 ( 37 ) with @entity80 heading home @entity87 's cross on nine			1
it was all change early in the second half when @entity7 drew level with two goals inside a minute			0
the first came when @entity93 pulled the ball back from the left to @entity96 who blasted a superb strike beyond @entity98			0
and @entity5 were left reeling when @entity80 pulled @entity7 level seconds later			2
@entity5 coach @entity44 took off @entity101 pair @entity100 and @entity102 soon after and replaced them with @entity105 midfielder @entity104 and @entity107 striker @entity106			0
and @entity1 had the final say in a match played in front of thousands of empty seats despite @entity114 president @entity113 's criticism that organisers had not done enough to sell tickets for @entity118 's game with @entity119 on sunday			1
@entity5 next face @entity121 winners @entity62 on thursday before facing world champions @entity60 on june 21			1
@entity7 play @entity60 on thursday before meeting the @entity124 with the top two from each group go through to the semifinals			2
@entity60 were trailing 1 - 0 against the @entity62 at the interval after @entity130 forward @entity129 fired his side ahead from the penalty spot after 41 minutes			1
the @entity124 were already down to 10 men following the dismissal of @entity135 who was given a straight red card after 33 minutes for a foul on @entity139			0
but the introduction of @entity58 just before the hour mark turned the game			0
the @entity144 striker blasted home from 30 yards to equalise on 59 minutes before @entity146 put @entity60 in front with 18 minutes left			0
@entity58 then added the finishing touch in injury time as the @entity60 moved joint top of @entity151 alongside @entity5 .			2

@entity1 converts penalty to give holders @entity5 a 4 - 3 @entity11 win over @entity7
substitute @entity17 was red - carded after handling on the goalline
@entity7 lodged complaint with @entity114 claiming 4th official influenced ref 's *verdict*
