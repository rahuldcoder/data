@entity0 -- a " pocket dial " mistake can result in an unwanted phone call , annoying for the recipient and potentially embarrassing to the caller			0
but a new study found a staggering number of those apparently accidental calls in @entity0 are made to emergency responders , jamming up 911 lines in a city that has prided itself on its ability to respond in a crisis			2
nearly 4 million of those calls were made to the city 's emergency call centers in 2010 , according to a recent @entity19 report , commissioned by the city after a massive blizzard delayed first responders and left mayor @entity23 open to criticism			1
that 's more than one - third of some 11 million emergency calls made in @entity0 each year , the study found , which was released friday			1
those calls were 19 seconds or less			0
authorities determined that they were likely accidental and say unnecessary communications add an increased burden on emergency response systems			1
" the increased proliferation of cellular telephones has caused a dramatic increase in the number of accidental 911 calls made , " the report said			2
in 2011 , the @entity38 issued a report estimating that 70 % of all 911 calls -- intentional or mistaken -- were made from wireless devices			0
the consulting firm recommended implementing a citywide information campaign to alert the public of the issue and to streamline systems between the police and fire departments , among other recommendations .			0
