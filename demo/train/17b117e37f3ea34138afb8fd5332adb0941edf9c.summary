-- @entity2 's loose - lipped overseas partners are exchanging whispers about the next - generation @entity4 , claiming it will come in three different versions , one of which would work with @entity10 's network			1
the ipad 2 will support three different wireless configurations : @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 only , according to " industry sources quoted by @entity14 " citing component makers			0
that 's up from the two versions @entity2 currently offers : @entity16 plus @entity18 , and @entity18 only			2
to explicate the alphabet soup , @entity16 is the standard used by major 3g carriers such as @entity24 and @entity25 , while @entity17 is compatible with @entity10 and @entity27 networks			2
currently the @entity4 ships with a @entity30 card slot , and in the @entity31 , the only carrier that uses @entity30 is @entity24			1
customers who want to connect to non-at&t 3g networks must either buy an external wireless hotspot device such as the @entity36 ( @entity10 already sells a @entity36 plus @entity4 package ) or trim a standard sim card down to @entity30 size , like @entity41 's @entity40			1
the current @entity43 model of the @entity4 is not tied to a contract : customers pay a flat monthly rate for data and can opt out whenever they please			0
so if this rumor is true , it means that when the @entity4 2 ships , you 'll have to pick a 3g model based on your carrier preference			0
if you do n't plan to be on the road a lot , there 's still the @entity18 option			0
support for both major wireless standards in the @entity31 will make the @entity4 2 available to a much larger potential audience , whereas before it was only available in the states from @entity24			1
wired : with @entity4 , @entity2 still has fatal attraction for @entity24 whether @entity2 hammers out sales agreements with @entity10 or @entity27 remains to be seen			1
recent rumors suggestion that the @entity66 will hit stores april 2011 , one year after the original @entity4 's release			0
some third - party protective cases for a purported " @entity4 23 have been cropping up in @entity70 , hinting at the possibility of a bigger speaker and a rear - facing camera			0
persistent rumors -- so far unsubstantiated -- have also pointed to a @entity10 - compatible @entity76 to be released in early 2011			2
if @entity10 gets the @entity76 and the @entity4 , it would greatly expand @entity2 's potential market , and would also likely deal a severe blow to @entity24 , which has been roundly criticized for the inability of its 3g network to keep up with @entity76 - induced demand			1

next generation @entity4 could come in three different versions
currently @entity4 ships with a @entity30 card slot , which is only used on @entity24
if @entity10 gets @entity76 and @entity4 , it would greatly expand @entity2 's potential market
