-- @entity2 sen. @entity1 , @entity3 , is asking the @entity4 to look into additional questions about unintended acceleration of @entity8 cars			1
citing unidentified whistle - blowers critical of " too narrow " federal investigations , the ranking member of the @entity10 asked the @entity4 in a letter to look into the phenomenon of " tin whiskers " -- or crystalline structures of tin -- that theoretically could lead to the unintended acceleration			1
the whistle - blowers also provided @entity1 with documentation about the investigations by @entity4 and @entity22 into the @entity8 vehicles , including one @entity22 report that stated : " because proof that the ( electronic throttle - control systems ) caused the reported ( unintended accelerations ) was not found does not mean it could not occur			1
" @entity1 's letter to the safety agency 's administrator , @entity30 , asks the agency to provide the committee with all information relating to tin whisker testing and for the agency 's position on tin whiskers ' possibly causing the unintended acceleration			1
@entity30 and his agency did n't immediately respond thursday to a @entity0 request for a comment			0
a @entity8 spokesman told @entity0 thursday that " so - called ' tin whiskers ' are not a new phenomenon and do not represent a mysterious or undetectable problem in a vehicle 's electronics			1
" last year , a federal investigation into possible causes of the unintended acceleration in @entity8 cars found no fault with the automaker 's electronic throttle - control systems , the @entity49 said			1
so far there are three known causes of unintended acceleration in @entity8 vehicles : improperly installed floor mats , sticky pedals and driver error			2
@entity8 spokesman @entity64 said thursday that " all the scientific evidence " confirms there 's no problem with the electronic throttle - control systems in @entity8 vehicles			2
" indeed , no data indicates that tin whiskers are more prone to occur in @entity8 vehicles than any other vehicle in the marketplace , " @entity64 said in an e-mail to @entity0			1
" further , no one has ever found a single real - world example of tin whiskers causing an unintended acceleration event , nor have they put forth any evidence of unintended acceleration occurring in a @entity8 vehicle because of tin whiskers forming inside an accelerator pedal position sensor , " @entity64 said			1
" @entity8 's systems are designed to reduce the risk that tin whiskers will form in the first place and multiple robust fail - safe systems are in place to counter any effects on the operation of our vehicles in the highly unlikely event that they do form and connect to adjacent circuitry , " @entity64 said			1
in @entity1 's letter dated july 12 and released publicly thursday , the senator asks @entity30 why his agency relied on @entity22 engineers and whether the agency lacks " the sufficient expertise to conduct such investigations and why			0
" said @entity1 in the letter : " this is a serious issue			0
from 2000 to 2010 , @entity22 concluded there were 9,698 identified @entity108 ( unintended acceleration ) customer complaints and @entity4 concedes that this is likely only a fraction of the actual incidents of @entity108 : ' @entity4 assumes that not all incidents are reported and that , accordingly , each complaint represents a greater number of unreported real - world failures			0
' " @entity1 asks the agency how many of the 9,698 vehicles were inspected for tin whiskers			1
in march , @entity0 reported that @entity8 engineers found an electronic software problem that caused " sudden unintended acceleration " in a test vehicle during pre-production trials , according to a company engineering document obtained by and translated for @entity0			2
the 2006 document , marked " confidential , " recounted the results of an adaptive cruise - control software test in a model internally designated the @entity130 , a vehicle later sold as the @entity132 in @entity133 and @entity134			0
the document says a " fail - safe overhaul " would be needed for another model in production , internally designated the @entity138 , which the company says was later sold as a @entity140			0
in response , @entity8 asserted that the document shows no such thing , and the company continues to deny that any sudden unintended acceleration in any of its vehicles was caused by electronic systems			2
the @entity133 - language document said that @entity8 engineers recorded a " sudden unintended acceleration " in the @entity130 's adaptive cruise control , which was designed to slow the vehicle if sensors detected an object ahead and accelerate the vehicle when the obstacle clears , according to a @entity151 - based translation house with expertise in automotive and technical matters that @entity0 retained to independently translate the document			2
@entity8 insisted the translation was inaccurate			0
despite multiple requests , the company did n't provide its own translation of the document			0
neither the test vehicle nor the adaptive cruise - control system cited in the document has been sold in the @entity2 , @entity8 said			0
@entity1 set a july 26 deadline for the @entity4 to respond to his eight sets of questions			0
@entity0 's @entity174 contributed to this report .			0

sen. @entity1 , @entity3 , received documents from whistle - blowers
@entity1 is the ranking member of the @entity10
questions bear upon " tin whiskers " possibly causing the acceleration
@entity8 says " tin whiskers " do n't " represent a mysterious *...* problem "
