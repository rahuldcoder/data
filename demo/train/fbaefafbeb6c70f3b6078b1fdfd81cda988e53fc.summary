editor 's note : for 85 years , @entity2 has hosted some of the greatest moments in sports			1
on sunday , the @entity6 will play their last game before the stadium is torn down			1
former @entity6 pitcher @entity9 played on the 1963 @entity10 all - star team and in two @entity11			1
he wrote the classic baseball book , " @entity13 , " named as one of the " @entity15 " by the @entity16 , and has been a sportscaster and actor			1
for @entity9 's web site , click here @entity9 was photographed as a rookie in 1962 at @entity2 , before the renovation of the ballpark			1
@entity24 , @entity25 ( @entity26 ) -- i 'll never forget my first day in @entity28 that @entity29 : april 9 , 1962 , the day before opening day			1
i made the team that spring as a non-roster player , having pitched in the @entity32 ( @entity33 ) the year before			1
and i had just turned 23			1
the @entity6 had scheduled an afternoon workout , but i was so excited that i could n't sleep and i drove in from my parents ' house in @entity37 at 7 in the morning			1
after introducing myself to a skeptical guard , he led me down two flights of stairs and through a hallway , where i was greeted by the clubhouse man @entity43 ( who died in 1985 and for whom the room is now named )			1
the @entity6 clubhouse in 1962 was like a large subterranean living room			1
a wall - to - wall grayish green carpet muffled all sound , and the overhead lighting was subdued			1
three walls of walk - in wood lockers faced a wall of large frosted windows that cast shafts of light from the street above			1
everything was painted a muted gray green to match the carpet , including the exposed ductwork in the ceiling above			2
a cleat - dented wooden stool sat in front of each locker			2
and hanging in the lockers , with military precision , were the classic yankee uniforms			1
" your locker is right here by the door , " said @entity43			2
i could n't help smiling when i saw @entity75 's nameplate just one locker away			1
i asked @entity43 if this was the same room that @entity78 and @entity79 and all those guys used			2
he pointed to a locker across the room where he used to bring " a bi-carb and coffee " each day to the @entity78			2
@entity43 returned to his duties and i touched my uniform reverently			2
with no one around , i decided to try it on			2
i adjusted my hat in a mirror			2
that looked good , too			2
ireport.com : share your memories of @entity2 then i grabbed my glove and went out to the field -- you know , just to get oriented			1
after sitting in the dugout a few minutes , i trotted out to the mound			2
looking up at the three tiers of stands was like being in the @entity103			2
of course , i had to toe the rubber and look in for the sign			2
fortunately , at that hour of the morning , it was just me and the pigeons			0
what would it be like to pitch there when the stands were filled with people ? my big chance came on may 7 , 1962 , in the second game of a double - header against the @entity116 , in front of a real crowd that included my @entity120 , my brothers and a whole bunch of neighbors from @entity37			0
i was thrilled and scared at the same time -- maybe a little more on the scared side			0
i walked the bases loaded with nobody out			0
then i fell behind 3 and 1 on the fourth hitter			0
my next pitch was a little bit high and manager @entity128 stepped out of the dugout - either to calm me down or remove me from the premises			0
but the umpire , bless him , called it a strike and @entity128 stepped back into the dugout			0
the inning seemed to last forever , but i finally got out of it and ended up pitching a complete game shutout			0
maybe the worst shutout in history - 7 walks and 7 hits			0
after the game @entity128 said to me , " any more shutouts like that and we 're going to need a new bullpen			0
" the best part was when i walked into the clubhouse after the game			0
i arrived a few minutes late because i 'd done a tv interview in the dugout			0
and when i opened the door , there was a path of white towels leading to my locker -- and @entity159 was laying down the last towel			1
this is my favorite memory of @entity2			1
unless it was @entity159 's 9th inning walk - off home run in ' 64 @entity11 that beat the @entity164 2 - 1 , which also happened to be my first @entity11 win			1
after that it was all down hill			0
in 1968 a sore arm got me traded to the @entity168 for a bag of batting practice balls			0
that 's the year i kept a diary that became @entity13 -- a book that also mentioned mantle hitting a home run with a hangover -- which got me banned from @entity177 at @entity2 for 28 years			1
my eventual return to @entity2 came after my son @entity179 wrote a letter to the @entity181 , saying the @entity6 should let bygones be bygones and invite me back			1
it was such a beautiful letter the @entity6 were embarrassed into inviting me			0
after 28 years , @entity2 was a different place -- a strange and garish place			1
a makeover in 1973 - 75 , under the new owner @entity186 , added cantilevered stands that destroyed the elegant upper fa√ßade , and exterior elevators which spoiled the view of the of the lower facade			0
inside , the grayish green carpet was now bright blue and featured a giant @entity6 logo			0
the honest ceiling with its exposed pipes was now a dropped ceiling with stark white tiles			0
everything was painted blue and white -- the @entity6 colors , get it ? now , instead of restoring the stadium , they 're going to tear it down			0
raze the clubhouse where @entity43 made coffee for @entity78			0
destroy the dugout where @entity205 slept			0
bulldoze the field where @entity159 roamed and level the mound where @entity209 pitched the only perfect @entity11 game			1
and they 're going to build an underground parking garage on the site ! this will no doubt be " @entity216 that @entity29 " -- which could produce a reverse " @entity215			0
" if you check the current standings , you 'll see this may already be happening			0
