@entity0 -- did you ever wonder why @entity3 kept charging at the football , despite the fact that @entity6 always pulled it away and he wound up flat on his back ? you would think that experience has made him skeptical			0
it 's because he really wanted to believe that , this time , things would work out			0
and when you really want to believe in something , you have a short memory when it comes to past disappointments			0
that 's how it is with many latinos and other immigration reform advocates			2
they want president @entity21 to become the person they voted for -- who promised @entity18 that he would fix a broken immigration system , stop dividing families , and push through @entity26 a @entity28 - like legislation that would give undocumented young people a pathway to legal status if they go to college or join the military			1
none of that happened , and so @entity18 -- who , in 2008 , voted overwhelmingly for @entity21 -- are ambivalent about the president 's re-election			1
something had to be done to convince @entity18 that the president is on their side			0
today , something was done			0
or rather , something was promised			0
the @entity21 administration announced that it would stop deporting younger illegal immigrants who came to the @entity45 as children -- provided they meet certain conditions -- and begin granting work permits to them			1
illegal immigrants will supposedly benefit from the new policy if they were brought to the @entity45 before they turned 16 , if they are 30 or younger , if they have lived in the country for at least five years , if they have no criminal record and if they attend or graduated from a @entity45 high school , or have served in the military			1
the policy change could affect as many as 800,000 immigrants -- so - called @entity58 -- who would have benefited from the @entity28 had it not been blocked by @entity26			1
these people have been living in fear of being deported by the same administration that is now offering the pardon			0
we 've only just begun to make our way down this rabbit hole			0
the administration is obviously trying to " checkmate " a nearly identical proposal floated by @entity69 sen. @entity69 of @entity70 , which reportedly would also stop @entity58 from being deported and issue them work permits			1
the @entity69 plan would not offer a pathway to citizenship			0
about this omission , the left was incensed			0
but @entity21 is n't offering a pathway to citizenship either , and yet many in the left could n't be happier			1
where is the consistency ? then there is the inconvenient fact that we 're not supposed to even need this kind of policy change because , according to @entity21 , his administration is n't deporting @entity58 at all ; instead , it 's concentrating its enforcement efforts on criminals			1
that 's exactly what @entity21 told @entity95 anchor @entity94 during a march 2011 trip to @entity97			1
a couple of weeks later , @entity21 had to swallow those words when -- during an education town hall meeting in @entity101 , sponsored by @entity95 -- he was confronted by a @entity103 holding deportation papers			2
so now we 're supposed to applaud the administration for not deporting people the president had claimed were n't being deported in the first place			2
of course , the administration is deporting @entity58 , along with gardeners , housekeepers , nannies and ice cream vendors who represent no threat to public safety			1
it 's a waste of time for officials to deny that			0
just this week , i wrote in my @entity1 column about another one of @entity21 's broken promises			1
the administration pledged to use prosecutorial discretion to free from deportation proceedings individuals who had been in the country for a number of years , had @entity45 - born children , or were otherwise rooted in the @entity45			0
so far , the promise has n't amounted to much of anything			0
i expect a similar outcome with @entity58			2
some of them may benefit from @entity21 's new initiative , but many probably wo n't			1
that 's because the idea behind the @entity28 -- trading legal status for college attendance or military service -- is still unpopular with most voters in this country			2
the administration has no interest in antagonizing a wide portion of the electorate in an election year			0
it does n't matter anyway , at least not to the president			0
all he cares about is his bid for re-election , and whether this latest stunt helps improve the turnout of @entity158 voters			1
people get fooled , especially if they 're not paying attention			0
in fact , i 've realized that @entity21 's immigration record is most impressive to those who follow it least closely			1
in other words , the closer you follow the record , the less impressive it seems			2
overheard on @entity1 : decision to defer some deportations symbolic in the words of @entity174 , the last president to actually grant an amnesty to illegal immigrants and not just talk about it , @entity158 voters , immigrant advocates and the @entity58 themselves should -- in response to this latest promise -- " trust , but verify			1
" and , given the administration 's record , they can skip the first part			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			2

@entity21 administration says it will stop deporting young illegal immigrants
@entity188 : this is a stunt to help improve @entity21 's chance with @entity158 voters
he says some @entity58 may benefit from @entity21 's initiative , but many probably wo n't
@entity188 : @entity21 's immigration record is most impressive to those who follow it least closely
