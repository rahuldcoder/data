the @entity1 ambassador to @entity2 says the alliance has no plans for military intervention in the @entity7 crisis , as reports of deaths mount by the dozens and diplomatic efforts have yet to stymie the bloodshed			1
@entity13 told reporters late sunday there is " no planning going on that 's related to a @entity2 role in @entity7			1
" " as it relates to @entity2 planning , a @entity2 ally has to come forward and request that type of planning			2
so that 's a circumstance that has n't taken place , " the ambassador said			0
" we 'd obviously take any requests of that nature seriously if it were to be made			0
" @entity13 also said that @entity2 , along with @entity31 allies and @entity33 partners , has provided assistance to the @entity7 opposition , including political and diplomatic support			1
" we 've also decided , however , that a military intervention of the nature that we did in @entity39 would further militarize the situation in ways that would n't necessarily protect civilian life , " @entity13 said			0
" ... unlike @entity39 , you do n't have pockets of the country that can be protected by civilian protection zones			1
you 've got security forces intermingled with the population , and that introduction of greater military intervention from outside or arms to groups within @entity7 could further militarize the conflict in a counterproductive way			0
" on the same day @entity13 spoke , at least 60 people were killed in @entity7 's 14 - month crisis , opposition activists said			1
among the dead , at least 40 were killed in the northwestern city of @entity59 , where a neighborhood sustained heavy shelling by government troops , said the @entity63 , a network of opposition activists			1
on monday , activists said , six people died across the country			2
the deaths included three unidentified bodies			0
the @entity71 says at least 9,000 people have been killed since initially peaceful protests against president @entity74 erupted in march 2011			0
opposition activists put the toll at more than 11,000			1
@entity7 's government , meanwhile , said it buried 18 more members of its security forces who died battling " armed terrorist groups " around the country			2
@entity83 can not independently verify reports of deaths and violence because the @entity7 government has severely restricted access by international media			0
the fighting has continued despite a peace plan brokered by former @entity92 secretary - general @entity92 , now a special envoy for the @entity71 and the @entity94 .			0
