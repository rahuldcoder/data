@entity0 -- " expect us " is the favorite tag line for an endless stream of web videos posted by the internet collective known as @entity6			1
it 's a promise and a threat			0
in 2011 , galvanized by the national occupy movement , @entity6 delivered			2
" this is what happens when the people have had enough , " said " @entity13 , " a member of the collective who joined the street protests in @entity0			1
" this is what happens when greed goes unchecked			0
it 's the closest thing to a global revolution we 've ever gotten			0
" from the inception of @entity25 , @entity6 has had a powerful impact on the movement , promoting it tirelessly through social media in the early days ; driving it forward with @entity30 campaigns , known as " ops , " targeting bankers and politicians ; and ultimately acting as a savage and effective counterforce to what the group sees as a militarized police state			1
" hopefully , he 'll think twice before he pulls out his baton against somebody who 's holding a sign saying we just want peace , " said @entity13 , who spent weeks monitoring and videotaping @entity40 officers during the height of the @entity25 protests			2
the list of police officers and agencies targeted by @entity6 is long			1
from @entity0 to @entity54 , @entity55 , cops had their web sites hacked ; personal information , including the home addresses of specific police officers , was posted online ; and officers who used pepper spray on occupy protesters , including @entity40 deputy inspector @entity62 and lt. @entity63 at the @entity64 , saw their entire life histories blasted out in web videos and document dumps			1
" i think [ police ] see it as a form of vigilantism , " said professor @entity68 , an anthropologist who studies @entity6 at @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71			1
the collective , @entity77 said , " is pushing the boundaries of the law , but i think some of their actions also reveal the ways that private security companies or police are also acting outside of the boundaries of the law			2
" the online intimidation is intended both to punish errant police and serve as a warning to riot cops facing difficult decisions in the heat of often chaotic protests			0
police are reluctant to speak publicly about the collective 's activities because @entity6 is so quick to target critics			1
but privately , they 're furious , especially when @entity6 posts the names of family members			1
occasionally , the battle between police and @entity6 erupts on @entity103			1
last year , a @entity105 homicide detective who goes by the name @ @entity107 had his personal information dumped online , and he retaliated with a series of sarcastic tweets			0
" let it be known to all , " he wrote , " your mainly teenagers in your moms house			0
" @entity6 is also the subject of several federal and state investigations , including one by the commonwealth of @entity120 , which issued subpoenas to @entity103 in an investigation of threats directed against @entity125 police after the department 's website was hacked			1
like police , members of @entity6 are also reluctant to speak publicly , both for their own security and because it runs counter to their deeply held belief that the positions held by the collective , expressed through the rolling democracy of the @entity30 , are far more important than the opinions of any individual anon , or person who participates in @entity6 activities			1
" @entity13 " agreed to talk to @entity1 on camera provided we not reveal his real identity			0
" there 's no specific group or one person that talks for us , " he says			0
" it 's more like a hive ; an idea is brought up and ... if the overwhelming majority of people agree with it , then we go with it			0
" monitoring and exposing what they see as police misconduct is one of the ideas that caught fire			2
in one internet relay chat session , members of the collective who go by the online handle @entity166 said police need to understand that the @entity30 is unpredictable and uncontrollable			1
" we can not control or limit what some individual anon may or may not do , neither is it in our interest , " they said			0
" if some cop finds it funny to mace innocent girls , @entity30 crowd will hate him			0
which will include his family			0
like it or not , it 's just what happens			0
" this year is expected to bring more protests centered on high - profile gatherings , such as the @entity185 and @entity186 summits in @entity187 in may and the political conventions in late summer			2
in the past , those kinds of events have been marked by sometimes violent clashes between protesters and police			2
this time , @entity6 will be watching .			2

member of hacker collective says people have been *abused* for too long
group hacks websites of police officers it claims engaged in misconduct
members *rarely* speak to the media
with *big* political events ahead this year , @entity6 promises to be watchful
