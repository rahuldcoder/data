-- when the @entity3 found out den leader @entity4 is a lesbian , the organization 's @entity1 sent her a letter saying " you must immediately sever any relationship you may have " with the @entity3			1
" you should understand that @entity3 ( @entity3 ) membership registration is a privilege and is not automatically granted to everyone who applies , " the group wrote in the april 12 , 2012 , letter that @entity10 , a 33 - year - old mom in @entity12 , photographed and sent to me recently			1
" we reserve the right to refuse registration whenever there is concern that an individual may not meet the high standards of membership the @entity3 seeks			2
" that reference to " high standards " is apparently the @entity3 way of saying gays and lesbian scout leaders need not apply			1
you may have heard people describe the @entity3 as gay - friendly this week , since the group voted to amend its draconian policies that banned " open or avowed homosexuals " from participating in the group as @entity3			1
the 103 - year - old organization -- known for its worthwhile efforts to teach kids to tie knots , survive in the woods and become more civic - minded adults -- decided on thursday that gay scouts should be able to participate in the organization			1
but not gay and lesbian leaders			1
the @entity46 voting members approved the change with more than 60 % of the vote			0
still , the @entity3 will have a hard time escaping the organization 's new reputation as a den for outdated thinking and discrimination			1
the group 's attitudes on gay rights are " more out of style than the scout socks , " said @entity60 , a former @entity61 who mailed his badge back to the organization because of its discriminatory policies			1
" i never wore those damn socks , " he said , laughing			0
it 's clear the @entity3 are lost in the woods			1
@entity60 represents the core of the scouting organization 's problem			2
he 's 34 , straight and the father of two kids			0
he credits the @entity3 with helping him become an outgoing , confident and successful person			2
" scouting was awesome , " he said			0
but he would n't enroll his son in the program unless gays and lesbians are allowed to be @entity3 and @entity61 leaders , too			1
he does n't want them to learn to discriminate from an organization that claims to value kindness and bravery			2
the same goes for @entity10 , the former @entity88 den leader in @entity12			1
her son @entity90 would love to be able to participate in the @entity3 again , she said			2
and she would love for him to be able to do so			0
she noticed improvements in his maturity and confidence when he was part of the group			0
but she wo n't go back unless everyone is welcome			0
" they 're teaching them to be bigots essentially , " she said			0
" this world is changing so quickly			0
you ca n't raise leaders for tomorrow on principles founded 100 years ago			1
" when i spoke with @entity10 earlier , i sympathized with her wanting to celebrate the proposal to include gay scouts as a " tiny step in the right direction			1
" hundreds of thousands of people had petitioned the scouts to allow gay kids to participate			2
@entity114 became a national celebrity of sorts after he was refused his @entity61 because he 's openly gay			1
( @entity118 had him on her show and gave him a $ 20,000 scholarship			0
) i am certainly thankful the @entity3 did decide to allow all openly gay kids to be members			1
but it 's frustrating and unfair that @entity125 leaders also affirmed discrimination against adult scout leaders			2
the scouts should n't tell children there 's nothing wrong with gay kids , but that there is something mysterious and dangerous about gay and lesbian adults			1
for one thing , it 's illogical			0
" how does a ( gay scout ) commit his life to an organization who he knows full well is going to dump him the day he turns 18 ? " @entity10 asked when we spoke in april , before this week 's vote			1
" it would be really hard for that boy to believe in trustworthiness and loyalty and all those things that are important as a @entity61			2
" gay kids : fine			0
adults ? not so much			0
the problem may be that the @entity3 are listening too much instead of making decisions with conviction			0
they 're " licking their finger and testing the wind , " as @entity60 put it , trying to figure out how to please all constituencies			0
that 's , of course , impossible			0
the anti-gay @entity163 recently uploaded a @entity165 video ( watch it ; this sort of over-produced fear - mongering has become a hilarious parody of itself ) saying that the @entity3 were " abandoning their moral compass " by thinking of including gay @entity3			1
i do n't think the @entity3 has abandoned its compass			2
but it 's clear it still needs to be recalibrated to the times			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity179 .			0

@entity3 voted to end its ban on gay scouts
the organization will *continue* , however , to ban gay @entity61 leaders
@entity187 : the group ca n't have it both ways and should include everyone
@entity179 *speaks* with a den leader who was ousted because she 's a lesbian
