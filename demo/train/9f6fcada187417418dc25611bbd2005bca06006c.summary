-- five things learned from sunday 's @entity3 debate : everybody gets their follow - up there 's been a lot of grousing about the back - to - back debate schedule but , in fact , the candidates seemed to relish the chance to follow up on their performances saturday night			1
both @entity14 and @entity15 were panned for failing to land a blow on @entity17 saturday			1
that changed within the opening minutes of monday 's match - up , with both candidates moving aggressively against @entity17 right out of the gate			1
meanwhile , @entity22 had clearly been thinking about @entity17 's saturday criticism of his service as ambassador to @entity26 under president @entity27			1
@entity22 took the opportunity to respond sunday			2
" i was criticized last night by gov. @entity17 for putting my country first , " he said			2
" i will always put my country first			2
i think that 's important			0
" the one candidate clearly put to a disadvantage by the opportunity to fix saturday night 's mistakes : @entity17 , the longtime front - runner who skated through the first debate untouched and who is hoping to maintain the status quo days before @entity39 voters head to the polls			1
looking ahead to the general election ? as in saturday 's debate , gay rights once again played a role in this one			1
@entity14 -- a man who has run on a predominantly social values platform -- offered perhaps his strongest statement of homosexual support to date , saying he would not repudiate a son who told him he was gay			1
he was careful , however , not to say that he would fight for gay individuals , instead saying he would be an advocate for " every person in @entity51 " and would make sure people are treated with " respect and dignity			0
" " that does not mean that i would agree with certain things that the gay community would like to do to change laws , with respect to marriage , with respect to adoption and things like that , " he said			0
on the same topic , @entity17 said he has hired gay staffers in the past and would never discriminate against gays or attempt to take away their rights			1
are these two men looking ahead to a general election , where strong social conservative values may not play as well on a national scale ? perhaps			0
over the past few years the @entity74 ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) rights movement has made strides , and many question whether someone who is not pro-lgbt could win a general election in the @entity51 in 2012			2
that said , social issues played a big role in @entity86 , and will do so again in @entity87			0
@entity14 's answer may have been a good middle - of - the - road response , and a reminder of a phrase often used by @entity93 conservatives : love the sinner , not the sin			2
that may be a message to which conservative voters in the upcoming state of @entity87 can relate			0
dealing with democrats calls for bipartisanship at a @entity3 presidential debate ? could it be ? both former house speaker @entity15 and former @entity106 gov. @entity17 touted their records of working with @entity100 to hammer out legislative deals			1
@entity111 , who is best know for battling president @entity112 in the 1990s , highlighted that he struck deals with the @entity100 president , even though he wanted to make him " a one - term president			1
" and @entity17 noted that when he was running @entity106 , the state legislature was 85 % @entity100 , but that he found " common ground , " adding that he 's proven that he can " work with @entity3 and @entity100 who are willing to work together			1
" @entity14 touted his ability to gain support among voters of both parties in his former @entity124 district , and @entity22 said serving one 's country should always trump party loyalty			1
but before candidates can work on uniting the party , they will have to triumph over their rivals as the bruising @entity3 primary plays out this winter			0
@entity22 's last stand ? since former @entity137 gov. @entity22 is placing all his chips on a strong finish in @entity39 's tuesday primary , this weekend 's two presidential debates were his last , best chance to make his case for the @entity3 nomination			1
saturday 's lukewarm performance by @entity22 , who has failed to gain much traction in the polls , was followed by a stronger delivery on sunday morning			1
after coming under attack saturday night by bitter rival @entity17 for his service as @entity51 ambassador to @entity26 during the first two years of president @entity27 's term , @entity148 strongly defended his time in @entity154			1
but he also highlighted his fiscal plans as in tune with conservative @entity3 principles			0
and in a state where independent voters could determine who wins the primary , @entity22 made his pitch , saying " the @entity51 people are tired of the partisan division			2
and i say , we 've had enough , and we have to change our direction in terms of coming together as @entity51 first and foremost and finding solutions to our problems			0
" no one taking super @entity172 high road @entity111 finally had his face - off with @entity17 over super pac ads that have been a negative undercurrent in the 2012 race			1
both candidates ignored a question sunday about whether they would agree to urge super pacs supporting their candidacy to take down negative advertisements			0
it became clear , as long as the claims in the influential ads are factually accurate , neither @entity111 nor @entity17 is above letting the groups do their mudslinging for them			1
@entity111 , the former speaker who has been the target of a majority of the negative super pac ads , endorsed an upcoming movie - length spot about @entity17 and his work with venture capital firm @entity193			2
" i agree with ( @entity17 ) , it takes broad shoulders to run			2
if you ca n't take the heat , get out of the kitchen , " @entity111 said			0
" when the 27 - and - a - half minute movie comes out , i hope it 's accurate			0
i can say publicly i hope that the super @entity172 runs an accurate movie about @entity193			0
" @entity111 also took aim at the front - runner for dishing " pious baloney " about his political history and reasons for launching a @entity207 bid			0
" i realize the red light does n't mean anything to you because you 're the front - runner , " @entity111 said			0
" but can we drop a little bit of the pious baloney ? " and @entity17 chided @entity111 for his campaign trail rhetoric			2
" mr. speaker , i would n't say some of the things you 've called me in public , " @entity17 said			0
" i think that 's just over the top			0
" @entity0 's @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 contributed to this report .			0

the candidates seem to relish a chance to follow up on saturday 's debate
@entity22 : " i will always put my country first "
@entity14 offers perhaps his strongest statement on gay rights
@entity111 , @entity17 say they have worked with @entity100 to hammer out deals
