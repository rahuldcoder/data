@entity0 -- nearly 6.2 million students in the @entity3 between the ages of 16 and 24 in 2007 dropped out of high school , fueling what a report released tuesday called " a persistent high school dropout crisis			1
" a new report on high school dropouts in the @entity3 calls for a national re-enrollment strategy			1
the total represents 16 percent of all people in the @entity3 in that age range in 2007			2
most of the dropouts were latino or black , according to a report by the @entity18 at @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , and the @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24			2
" because of the widespread , pressing nature of the crisis and the large numbers of young people who have already dropped out , a national re-enrollment strategy should be a fundamental part of @entity3 's national education agenda , " the report says			1
however , the report notes , the " absence of new funding at the federal and state level since the 1980s has led to decades of disinvestment in re-enrollment programs across the country			2
" despite the funding cutbacks , there have been re-enrollment successes nationally and in a number of cities including @entity23 ; @entity46 , @entity47 ; @entity49 , @entity50 ; and @entity51 , @entity52 , the report says			2
" these programs have found that young people who have left high school before earning a diploma are not dead - end dropouts , but often are in fact students waiting and looking for opportunities to re-enroll and finish high school , " the study says			1
" the most successful programs are small ( 80 - 150 students ) , offering comprehensive after - school and summer activities , led by experienced principals and teachers , focused on learning in the real world , well - funded with local school site program and fiscal control , and track specific , measurable outcomes for student achievement including skill gains , enrollment , attendance , credit gains , promotions and graduations			0
" @entity79 , 22 , was one of those dropouts who is now working on her degree			0
she said a street shooting in which one friend died and two were wounded was the start of her losing interest in school			0
" my junior year i dropped out , " she said at a summit in @entity0 on tuesday			0
" too much gang violence , teachers discriminating because of the color of my skin , or where i come from			0
" now re-enrolled in a @entity23 school dedicated to bringing dropouts back to education , @entity79 said , " they help me in my classwork			2
i have a mentor that checks up on me monthly			0
she goes to my house , sees if there 's anything that i need			0
" researchers for the study analyzed the @entity106 , household data from the @entity108 , national data on @entity111 certificate awards and other official sources to examine the problem at the national level and in the nation 's 12 largest states : @entity47 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity24 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			2
men and blacks and @entity129 of both genders are among those particularly prone to dropping out of high school			1
" as these data show , this dropout crisis is disproportionately affecting @entity3 's communities of color , " said @entity133 , president and chief executive officer of the @entity135			1
" youth from all communities deserve an equal chance at educational success			0
" among the findings in the report , " left behind in @entity3 : the @entity147 's @entity146 : " the dropout situation at the state level was similarly widespread : the report emphasized the importance of having at least a high school education			1
" in the current global economy , having at least a high school diploma is a critical step for avoiding poverty , and a college degree is a prerequisite for a well - paying job , " the study says			1
" the costs of dropping out of high school today are substantial and have risen over time , especially for young men , who find it almost impossible to earn an adequate income to take care of themselves and their families			1
" the report goes on to note : " @entity3 without a high school diploma have considerably lower earning power and job opportunities in today 's workforce			1
over a working lifetime from ages 18 - 64 , high school dropouts are estimated to earn $ 400,000 less than those that graduated from high school			1
for males , the lifetime earnings loss is nearly $ 485,000 and exceeds $ 500,000 in many large states			0
due to their lower lifetime earnings and other sources of market incomes , dropouts will contribute far less in federal , state and local taxes than they will receive in cash benefits , in - kind transfers and correctional costs			0
over their lifetimes , this will impose a net fiscal burden on the rest of society			0
" by contrast , adults with high school diplomas contribute major fiscal benefits to the country over their lifetime			1
the combined lifetime fiscal benefits -- including the payment of payroll , federal , and state income taxes --- could amount to more than $ 250,000 per graduated student			0
such a public fiscal benefit more than outweighs the estimated cost of enrolling a student who has dropped out			0
