-- last year on @entity2 , president @entity1 said that we can achieve an @entity5 - free generation " if we stay focused , and if we keep fighting , " and challenged the world to " come together to set new goals " in the war against @entity5			0
three decades into the epidemic , important headway has been made thanks to ambitious efforts by the @entity15 government to end @entity5 here and abroad			2
the @entity17 , released in 2010 , is the nation 's first comprehensive road map with clear and measurable targets to be achieved by 2015 : reduce new hiv infections , increase access to care and improve health outcomes for people living with @entity25 and reduce @entity25 - related disparities			1
over the past four years , it has prioritized funding where it will have the most impact			0
this @entity2 on december 1 , marked today , we can point to successes in combating @entity25 in the @entity15			1
the overall number of @entity15 who know their @entity25 status increased to 84 % approaching the @entity17 goal of 90 % by 2015			1
from 2008 to 2012 , @entity25 diagnoses declined among blacks , latinos and women nationally			1
the latest surveillance data show that new hiv infections have been declining among black women and injecting drug users			1
importantly , @entity5 diagnoses ( or diagnosing people late in their disease progression ) decreased among all racial and transmission groups during this time			1
the @entity48 has enabled millions of uninsured @entity15 to have access to health care and get free hiv testing			2
the @entity53 's @entity52 has boosted federal efforts to prevent and treat @entity25			1
meanwhile , a series of recent breakthroughs in @entity25 cure research have also brought us more clarity than we have ever had on the precise steps and tools needed to finally eradicate this disease			1
the federal government has prioritized cure research and @entity66 , @entity63 , recently upped the ante on cure research as well , setting a goal to invest $ 100 million in developing the scientific basis for a cure by 2020			2
unfortunately , we still have work to do			0
about 50,000 @entity15 continue to become infected with @entity25 each year , with nearly 80 % of infections among men and two - thirds of new infections nationally among gay and bisexual men			1
we continue to see high rates of new infections in the @entity81 , especially amongst african - americans			0
astoundingly , one third of all black gay men nationally are @entity25 - positive -- and they remain the population with the greatest number of infections in the black community and the only population in the black community in which new infections are increasing			1
though @entity25 diagnoses decreased among injecting drug users from 2008 to 2012 , @entity5 - related deaths remain the highest in this population			1
and beyond our borders , we have also reached a turning point			0
according to the @entity99 report that was released last week and the @entity101 report released in july 2014 , we have five years to break the epidemic for good or risk it rebounding out of control			0
we have made many gains , but there is still much more work to do			2
the annual number of new hiv infections has dropped by 33 % since 2001			2
and more people than ever are receiving lifesaving antiretroviral treatment , leading to historic declines in @entity5 - related deaths worldwide			2
this progress is encouraging , but we have a chance to rid the world of the epidemic now			0
the @entity15 must be a leader in this effort			0
the @entity15 leads the world in its commitment to combating @entity5 globally			0
@entity15 investments through the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) as well as the president 's @entity123 ( @entity123 ) have been transformative in the global response to @entity5			0
@entity123 is helping provide lifesaving @entity25 treatment to 6.7 million people , and has prevented countless infections among infants born to hiv - positive moters in some of the hardest hit regions			1
an estimated 35 million people worldwide are living with @entity25 , 19 million of them do not know they are infected , and more than 2 million become infected each year			1
@entity25 medications remain out of reach for far too many globally -- more than 20 million are unable to access treatment -- and budget cuts threaten the advances that we have made and the possibility of ending the @entity5 epidemic by 2030			1
we have an obligation to sustain and increase our contributions to the global @entity25 effort , especially since the @entity15 contribution to foreign aid ( including @entity25 prevention and other efforts ) is less than 1 of our total budget			2
@entity150 must do its part by providing level funding for @entity123 and the @entity122 in fiscal year 2015 , and increasing our contribution in subsequent years			0
level funding for @entity123 alone will allow an additional 272,000 people on treatment , keep an additional 17,000 infants from being born with @entity25 and avert an additional 62,000 @entity5 - related deaths			1
although we now have the tools and the knowledge needed to end the @entity5 crisis , the looming question is will we ? we believe that we can and we will			0
we must reject budget cuts that threaten to paralyze proven lifesaving @entity25 interventions			2
evidence continues to show that the scale - up of treatment for people living with @entity25 not only saves lives , but also greatly reduces the chances of an hiv - positive person transmitting the virus to others			1
@entity99 recently declared that , " if the world does not rapidly scale - up [ treatment ] in the next five years , the epidemic will spring back with a higher rate of new hiv infections than today			0
" momentum is on our side			0
now is not the time to slow down our efforts , or be complacent in our attitudes toward a disease that has already claimed 40 million lives and continues to ravage families and economies around the globe			0
our country has led on this issue domestically and globally			0
we must overcome our differences , combine our strengths and our resources and unite in our quest to finally end @entity5 and ensure the health and prosperity of future generations .			0
