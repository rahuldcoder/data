when you go to the polls for the midterm elections on tuesday , there will be a good chance that your @entity6 feed and your phone helped you decide how to vote			1
cell phones and social media platforms such as @entity6 and @entity10 are playing a bigger role in how @entity12 get their political information , according to a new survey from the @entity15			1
twice as many @entity12 used their phones to track information about this year 's elections than did so during the last midterms four years ago			1
and there was an even bigger increase in the number of respondents who said they follow political figures on @entity6 and other social media			1
in all , 16 % of registered voters said they follow politicians on social media , compared with the 6 % who said they did so in 2010			0
the leap has been even bigger among middle - aged voters			1
of registered voters from 30 to 49 , 26 % said they follow politicians online and 40 % of whom said they 've used their phones to help keep up with news about the elections			2
for their part , social media outlets are embracing this expanded role in the political process			0
on tuesday , @entity6 will place a banner at the top of @entity12 users ' feeds reminding them that it 's @entity46 and urging them to share with friends if they 've already voted			1
the shareable " i 'm a voter ! " message , which @entity6 calls a " megaphone , " is designed to stand out from regular @entity52 fare			0
the banner also will link users to a webpage showing them where their voting precinct is located			0
" @entity6 's mission is to make the world more open and connected , and a part of that is helping the people who use our platform to more easily engage with the leaders who make the decisions that affect their lives every day , " the company said in a written statement			2
" in fact , although the megaphone has been available in the @entity12 in elections in 2008 , 2010 and 2012 , for the first time ever this year , the megaphone was shown in elections internationally , including in @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			0
" in past elections , critics have complained that @entity6 's testing of the megaphone tool -- for example , using the worlds " i voted " on some and " i 'm voting " on others to see which had more impact -- could have an unfair impact on turnout			1
but @entity6 says the tool has been thoroughly tested and that no " research " will be done on tuesday			2
@entity10 is also getting in on the voting - day action			2
the microblogging site had developed the # @entity93 dashboard , which lets users follow political tweets , connect with candidates and see what others are saying , including the ability to hone in on state - specific conversations			0
@entity10 also will be sharing data it collects on users ' political activity with media outlets for their election - night coverage			1
while online activism has been traditionally associated with younger and , by extension , more liberal voters , the @entity15 survey showed no strong ideological difference in behavior this time out			1
republicans and @entity112 participated in the behaviors noted in the survey at roughly the same rates			0
voters from both parties said using social media and mobile technology makes them feel more engaged in the process and more connected to the politicians they support			0
@entity124 and @entity124 - leaning voters also said they like following politicians directly on social media because it allows them to skip the filter of traditional media outlets			0
the report is based on a national survey conducted october 15 - 20 among 2,003 adults ( including 1,494 registered voters ) .			0
