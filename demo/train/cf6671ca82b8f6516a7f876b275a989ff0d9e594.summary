a satirist who writes for the @entity24 , she 's confessed that the book -- about an unnamed , neurotic college girl who spends 10 years pining for a pretentious phd student -- is based on her own experience with her own unnamed douche nugget , which is probably why it feels so right			1

remember how content @entity74 was , just strumming his banjo on a tree trunk in the swamp ? that 's the guy i 've chased my whole life , killing myself trying to show him how fabulous i am			2
@entity74 never appreciated what he had in @entity72 , because she was just one great thing about his awesome life			2
i wonder how many guys from my generation looked to @entity74 as an example of what the coolest guy in the room looks like			2

@entity0 : a @entity104 5			0

the book became a cult success , and their children ( two girls and two boys ) grow up in its shadow			0
it depicts adult relationships in a very realistic but still interesting , way -- and the character of @entity183 , the older girl , is fascinating			1
@entity0 : 9 things he does n't want you to know 9			0
