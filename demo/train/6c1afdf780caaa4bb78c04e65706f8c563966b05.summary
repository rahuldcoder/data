@entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 and @entity4 have been running businesses in the @entity7 area for more than two decades			1
they tried selling neckties , then found success marketing a fabric chemical			2
but it 's the restaurant in downtown @entity0 , @entity13 , that is their love			1
as a black family , the @entity18 understood the rage that seethed and then exploded on the streets of @entity0 after a grand jury decided not to indict officer @entity23 , who is white , in the death of black teenager @entity25			1
protesters spilled onto @entity27 and met a line of riot police just outside @entity13			1
things got ugly after police warned the crowds to get off the streets and then fired tear gas			1
many businesses were vandalized and looted			1
some were razed by fire			2
" i understand there is not a proper regard for @entity46 - @entity45 life in this country , " said @entity38 , shivering in the cold by the shattered window in her restaurant tuesday			1
if @entity23 had been indicted , she is sure life would have moved on without blemish			2
instead , she and her husband found themselves not being able to open for business			1
she knew from a text she received that her eatery had been vandalized during the protests			1
but neither she nor her husband knew how they would find their beloved business			1
it was , after all , right next door to the @entity58			2
follow the latest news on @entity3 's @entity60 @entity13 was a labor of love , inspired by a family vacation several years ago			2
@entity4 was a huge fan of @entity65 's " vacation , " the movie series starring @entity67			2
so he copied the @entity68 , put his wife and three kids in an rv and drove from state to state			2
there 's a map in the restaurant of all the places they visited			2
@entity79 , @entity78 , @entity80 , @entity81			2
in each place , @entity38 picked up local flavors and spices			1
the menu at @entity13 reflects some of the dishes she savored on that vacation			2
the diner - style eatery has checkerboard floors and red walls			1
the two wall - mounted televisions are always set to @entity93 and the @entity94			0
and the sound of soul is always playing on the stereo			0
@entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
that is , when they 're not busy eating			0
there 's @entity81 - style gumbo , @entity80 @entity107 ' boys and @entity79 hot dogs			0
@entity38 likes to write the special of the day with chalk on the black - board table tops			1
pulled pork or turkey with gravy			0
no wonder the place is packed at lunchtime			0
on monday , the @entity18 closed early , around 3 p.m. , when they saw protesters gathering across the street			1
they put up a sign on their front door : " closed until further notice ! " the following morning , @entity13 sat dark and silent			0
' black lives matter ' the @entity18 knew their restaurant was not so badly damaged			0
they 'd seen video of protesters locking arms in front of the place to protect it from vandals			1
" i wish i knew who they were , " said @entity4 , " because i really would like to thank them			0
" the @entity18 planned to wake up early , rustle up relatives and be there by 8 to begin cleaning up			1
but by the time they arrived , people were already picking up the shards of glass from the window that was shattered			1
they were n't members of the @entity144			1
or any federal disaster agency			0
they were her customers , loyal to her on a day of tragedy			0
" i am overwhelmed , " she said			0
but this was the @entity0 she knew			1
a @entity0 that was about diversity and community			1
she said she had to believe the grand jury made the right decision			0
but she and her husband were both deeply disappointed that some protesters turned violent and that authorities failed to protect their city			1
" i thought when trouble erupted , the @entity144 would be here			2
then not to see a single military truck			0
" @entity4 said authorities had four months to " get this right			0
" he did n't understand why the decision was announced at night , why the police did n't react right away and why the military was not sent in after a state of emergency had been declared many days before			1
opinion : @entity45 , we have a problem " i hate what i have seen on @entity175 , " he said , referring to the main thoroughfare that intersects with the road where @entity25 was shot dead			0
it was the scene of nearly two weeks of protests , some violent , in the wake of the killing			0
after word spread that @entity23 would not be indicted , protesters clashed with riot police in @entity0			1
many businesses had their doors and windows smashed in			0
some were looted and set ablaze			0
@entity187 : ' no sympathy ' for violence in @entity0 " nobody was there to protect them , " @entity4 said			1
" to the @entity46 - @entity45 community , that is the greatest form of racism			0
you do n't protect and serve			1
you allow 20 to 30 criminals to come into our community and burn it down			0
" he said the images of @entity0 mistakenly portray a community not interested in bettering itself , when instead rogue elements are responsible for the violence			1
" a criminal is a criminal , " he said			0
" poverty brings crime , and you will see that where you go in the world			0
" @entity4 said he is not a man who would normally put his face in front of a television camera			0
" but it 's worth telling the world , ' listen , it was n't us as residents who dropped the ball			2
' " after the cleanup tuesday , the @entity18 hope to leave for @entity222 , where they both grew up , to enjoy @entity223 with family and friends			0
they do n't know what will happen in the next few nights , whether there will be more trouble			2
they hope to hang the " open " sign on the door again very soon			0
perhaps even as early as monday			0
