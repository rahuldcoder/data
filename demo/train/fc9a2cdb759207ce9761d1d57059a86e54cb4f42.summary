@entity0 -- will an anti-incumbent wave return republicans to power in the @entity5 and @entity6 , or can @entity7 engineer a late rush to hold on to their congressional majorities ? the 2010 mid-term elections comes down to campaign basics in the final nine days until vote - counting begins			1
for now , the two parties agree that @entity3 will win more seats than they currently hold , but they differ sharply on how many and whether a major power shift will occur			0
@entity17 chairman @entity16 told @entity18 's " @entity27 " program that an unprecedented @entity3 wave would win control of both chambers as well as state legislatures in a broad condemnation of president @entity25 and @entity7 policies			1
" the voters are tired of the fact that the federal government has not listened to them over the past two years , has moved in its own direction , at its own rhythm and they want to pull back on that , " @entity16 said			0
" and i think you 're going to see a wave , an unprecedented wave on election day that 's going to surprise a lot of people			0
" his @entity7 counterpart , former @entity42 gov. @entity41 , pointed to strengthening poll numbers for his party 's candidates as a sign that the @entity7 base was getting energized			1
" from this point forward , it 's all about turnout and ground game , and we 're seeing good early voting trends , " said @entity41 , the @entity48 chairman , when asked on the @entity50 program " @entity52 " if @entity7 can hold their majorities			1
" we 've got work to do , but we think we can do it			0
" while @entity41 said the @entity5 remains uncertain , he sounded much more confident about the @entity6			1
" four or five months ago , the @entity3 thought they had a great chance at taking both houses , " @entity41 said			2
" for a variety of reasons , the @entity6 has gotten much more difficult for them			0
and again , we 're seeing this week strong moves in polling for our @entity6 candidates " in several states			0
one of those reasons is inexperienced , conservative ideologues backed by the @entity71 movement who defeated mainstream @entity3 in primary elections and now trail @entity7 foes as the november 2 vote approaches			1
the @entity78 race is a prime example			0
@entity81 's primary win over nine - term @entity82 rep. @entity82 made a @entity6 seat once considered likely @entity3 now an apparent @entity7 victory for previously little - known @entity85			2
@entity81 's campaign became a national joke over a long - ago comment that she once " dabbled in witchcraft " and other missteps			0
it also exposed a rift within the political right between the mainstream @entity3 establishment , which criticized @entity81 and other @entity71 backed candidates , and the more conservative @entity71 movement			1
with the election approaching , @entity3 put on a united front sunday , with @entity3 strategist @entity100 -- one of @entity81 's harshest critics -- calling the @entity71 movement " patriotic " and " incredibly positive			1
" while noting that @entity71 backers " are not people who are skilled in the ways of @entity0 , " @entity100 told the @entity106 program " @entity111 " he welcomed the movement as a " wholesome development " that would greatly increase @entity3 turnout in a mid-term election			1
@entity100 predicted @entity3 will win well over 50 @entity5 seats to easily grab majority control of the chamber , and that a @entity3 @entity6 majority also was possible			2
on the same program , @entity7 rep. @entity116 of @entity117 predicted a different outcome , due to voter distrust of what he called special interest money going for anonymous donations to groups running attack ads against @entity7 candidates			2
the issue hammered by @entity7 including @entity25 in recent weeks was proving resonant , @entity116 said			2
" i 'm confident the @entity7 are going to retain their majority because the @entity130 people are connecting the dots between these tens of millions of dollars of secret special interest money , " he said , later adding : " the early voting states are showing good news for the @entity7			0
" both @entity100 and @entity16 said election disclosure laws should be changed , but added that the anonymous donations to groups running political ads complied with current law			0
@entity100 added that @entity7 including @entity25 benefited from similar anonymous campaign funding in the past .			1

nine days before the vote , both sides predict *success*
@entity100 calls @entity71 movement " wholesome " and " positive "
@entity41 says @entity7 poll numbers are trending up
