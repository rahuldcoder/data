the fight against " revenge porn " chalked up a small victory recently			1
so why am i not celebrating ? the @entity5 released a statement saying it had barred @entity7 , a @entity8 man , from posting nude images of women to his website without their written consent			1
we are by now familiar with the concept of what 's broadly known as " revenge porn , " that is , posting explicit images online of people -- women , mostly -- without their knowledge or permission			1
the practice has swept up celebrities such as @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , putting the issue on the national radar			0
sometimes the images are stolen by hackers able to access phones , computers or clouds ; in other cases , they may have , at one time , been willingly shared with a romantic partner who , after the relationship ends , seeks to enact " revenge " by making those private images public			1
the @entity5 's move is a positive step toward punishing these acts , mostly because it symbolizes that the federal government recognizes the seriousness of the violation			1
but it does n't go far enough			2
@entity7 was ordered to destroy the images he had in hand -- and that 's it			1
he was n't fined or sent to jail			2
that 's because revenge porn is n't a federal crime -- @entity7 was found in violation of the @entity56 , not in violation of criminal law			1
as an agency of the @entity61 government , the @entity5 can enforce federal laws but does not have the power to prosecute criminal cases on its own , instead referring cases to the @entity66 or a @entity61 attorney 's office			1
but because revenge porn is n't a federal crime , the punishments federal law enforcement can place on perpetrators are limited			1
and so the guy loses his pictures and has been told not to do it again			0
currently , 16 states have laws addressing revenge porn , though some are broader than others			1
prosecution often still depends on first determining who uploaded the photos -- many of these sites allow for anonymous postings -- and where the photo originated			0
if the photo was uploaded by a third party , the website may be protected from liability by the @entity94 , the same federal law that protects news outlets from being held liable for online comments made by readers and other user - generated material			2
a more effective law would be one that aims to protect personal information shared within the context of a confidential relationship and limits free speech to cover information that does not exploit the privacy of another private individual			0
( @entity110 's law , gets at this -- it makes it a felony for any person to disclose sexually explicit photos or images of someone else without that person 's consent			2
) but until recently , a @entity120 revenge porn law did not protect victims who took the photos themselves , even if those photos were stolen or otherwise posted without their knowledge or consent			1
that was n't just ineffectual lawmaking , but full on victim blaming			0
indeed , when it comes to revenge porn , there is a lot of that going around			1
think back to when @entity26 and others had their nude , formerly private photos posted online			2
people asked why these women would be so careless as to take them , and send them , in the first place ? what did they expect would happen ? never mind that many of the photos had been originally shared with trusted partners , some of whom were still in these women 's lives , or that in at least one case , the stolen pictures in question had been deleted years ago			0
( there are some very skilled hackers out there			0
) if they do n't exist , the logic goes , you 've got nothing to worry about			0
nothing , that is , beyond buying into the idea that women who " put themselves in a compromising position , " in a way deserve whatever consequences result			0
it 's a short hop to the thinking that helps rapists avoid punishment because " she asked for it , " or " she did n't say no , " or " just look at what she was wearing			2
just look at how she 's acted in the past			0
" there are many reasons to create stronger , clearer , federal criminal laws prohibiting the anonymous public posting of naked photographs of people who are not you			2
but perhaps the most important reason is to work toward eliminating , once and for all , the idea that victims of crimes bear any modicum of blame			0
criminal invasion of privacy continues to occur because criminals exist , and they are not adequately punished			0
curbing our own behavior only means they win .			0
