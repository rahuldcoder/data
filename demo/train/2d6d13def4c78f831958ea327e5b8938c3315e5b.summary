@entity0 -- three @entity3 senators introduced legislation monday to specifically ban so - called " crush videos " -- depictions of small animals being tortured to death by humans			1
the legislation came in response to a @entity12 ruling this year striking down a broader congressional law dealing with animal cruelty			1
the bi-partisan @entity15 would criminalize the creation , sale and marketing of these specific kinds of videos			2
penalties of up to seven years in prison would be possible			0
the videos mostly depict women -- with their faces unseen -- stomping helpless animals such as rabbits to death with spiked - heel shoes or with their bare feet			1
the videos apparently satisfy a sexual fetish for those who produce and watch them , said animal rights activists who supported the new bill			2
" our legislation would ban animal crush videos that fit squarely within the obscenity doctrine -- a well - established exception to the @entity44 , " said sen. @entity37 , @entity38 , a co-sponsor			1
" it also takes the important step of banning non-commercial distribution of animal crush videos , which is necessary given the nature of the @entity49 and the propagation of file - sharing and peer - to - peer networks that exist today			1
" sens. @entity53 , @entity54 , and @entity55 , @entity56 , also helped draft the legislation			2
the lawmakers said the high court ruling opened the door for @entity61 to craft a " narrowly tailored " bill aimed at banning this specific type of commercial activity			2
the justices by an 8 - 1 margin struck down a broader 1999 federal law designed to stop the sale and marketing of videos showing dogfights and other acts of animal cruelty , saying it was an unconstitutional violation of free speech			1
that specific case dealt with a @entity78 man who sold videos of dogs fighting each other at an overseas location			2
but in dissent , justice @entity83 focused his attention on crush videos			1
" the animals used in crush videos are living creatures that experience excruciating pain			1
our society has long banned such cruelty , " he said			0
the courts , he said , have " erred in second - guessing the legislative judgment about the importance of preventing cruelty to animals			2
" alito at the time predicted more crush videos would soon flood the underground market , because the ruling has " the practical effect of legalizing the sale of such videos			1
" lawmakers had promised to craft bills banning those types of videos			0
it was unclear if further legal challenges would result if the legislation passes with the president 's signature			0
when it came to dog - fighting videos , " @entity44 itself reflects a judgment by the @entity3 people that the benefits of its restrictions on the government outweigh its costs , " said chief justice @entity115			0
he concluded @entity61 had not sufficiently shown " depictions " of dogfighting were enough to justify a special category of exclusion from free speech protection			0
nearly every state and local jurisdiction have their own laws banning mistreatment of wild and domesticated animals , and usually handle prosecutions of animal cruelty			1
several media organizations had supported @entity139 -- the man behind the dogfighting videos -- worrying the federal law could implicate reports about deer hunting , and depictions of bullfighting in @entity147 novels			2
@entity115 suggested last april a law specifically banning crush videos might be valid , since it would be narrowly tailored to a specific type of commercial enterprise			1
@entity83 noted that would not help dogs forced to fight each other , where , he said , " the suffering lasts for years rather than minutes			0
" the government had argued a " compelling interest " in stopping people who would profit from dog - attack tapes and similar depictions			0
@entity115 dismissed suggestions by the @entity163 that only the most extreme acts of cruelty would be targeted			0
" @entity44 protects against the government , " @entity115 said			0
" we would not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the government promised to use it responsibly			0
" the @entity171 , other animal rights groups and 26 states backed the government			0
if that 1999 law had been upheld , it would have been only the second time the @entity12 had identified a form of speech undeserving of protection by the @entity44			1
the justices in 1982 banned the distribution of child pornography .			0

the legislation is aimed at " crush videos , " showing the deaths of small animals
the legislation follows a @entity12 ruling earlier this year
that ruling *overturned* a broader congressional law on animal cruelty
