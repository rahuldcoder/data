-- @entity1 is an exceedingly delicate material			0
it 's highly flammable , ca n't always go through @entity5 checkpoints , and , as it turns out , can be easily destroyed by fungus			0
a few years ago @entity9 artist @entity8 read a @entity11 article about this fungus problem affecting film archives			1
he realized they were right : " i noticed that mold on badly stored film can eat away and destroy its contents , " he says			1
" and then i realized that i may deliver the idea of impermanence of matter applying this natural disaster into my work			1
" it 's a heady notion , but when @entity8 talks about ' impermanence ' he 's talking about the " idea that all the matter , including all the life forms , collapse in the spatial - temporal dimension we belong to			1
" it 's his inspiration in this series , and it 's based on the second law of thermodynamics , which states that as usable energy in the universe gets used — to power life , and grow organisms — unusable energy increases and creates a state of growing randomness and chaos			2
put differently , @entity8 started letting mold grow on his film			1
rather than worrying about fungus , he embraced it			0

for such a gnarly material , the results often look like the cosmos , splashed across a photograph			0
at times the prints are haunting for their ability to distort a portrait into a ghostly scene — as if the subjects are vampires that ca n't be caught on camera			0
but it 's also a painstaking medium to work in : " to put thing in perspective , only one out of 500 frames of medium format color reversal film comes out properly and i only have 15 of them so far since i started the project in 2010			0
