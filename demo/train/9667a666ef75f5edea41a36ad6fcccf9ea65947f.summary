-- starting monday , @entity1 will no longer allow ads on pages that contain sexual or violent content			1
the move , announced in a blog post , comes after pressure from advocacy groups			0
it appears to target content that falls into a gray area -- likely to be deemed offensive by many , but which does n't go far enough to be banned by the site			0
" our goal is to both preserve the freedoms of sharing on @entity1 but also protect people and brands from certain types of content , " the post reads			2
in may , @entity1 was targeted by a coalition of women 's organizations complaining about pages or groups that seemed to celebrate or make light of violence against women			1
as part of the campaign , the groups petitioned @entity1 advertisers			2
the campaign appeared to have some effect			0
several advertisers , including @entity39 @entity38 and @entity40 , said they were pulling ads from @entity1 , while others said they were monitoring the situation			1
in response , the site announced it was redoubling efforts to stamp out hate speech			1
now @entity1 says it 's implementing new standards for which pages or groups may have advertising placed on them			1
" for example , we will now seek to restrict ads from appearing next to @entity56 that contain any violent , graphic or sexual content ( content that does not violate our community standards ) , " the post reads			2
" prior to this change , a page selling adult products was eligible to have ads appear on its right - hand side ; now there will not be ads displayed next to this type of content			2
" the process will begin with potentially offensive pages being flagged by humans but will eventually give way to " a more scalable , automated way to prevent and / or remove ads appearing next to controversial content			1
" with more than 1 billion users to monitor and sometimes grumbly investors to please , @entity1 finds itself having to satisfy users of the free service as well as the advertisers that provide the vast majority of its revenue			0
" like any digital platform , we 're not going to be perfect but we will be much better , " @entity1 said			0
" we 'll continue to work aggressively on this issue with advertisers			0
we are confident the immediate steps we 're taking will result in a significantly improved approach to preventing these instances from occurring , and we are committed to making this process work for everyone who uses @entity1			0
