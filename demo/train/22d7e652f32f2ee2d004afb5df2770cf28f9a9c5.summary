-- a week ago sunday , @entity2 sea ice cover reached its lowest extent ever recorded			1
for good reason , there has been significant media focus on how a warming sea gobbles up the ice that is polar bear habitat and reduces the area 's capacity to reflect the sun 's rays			1
this is roughly equivalent to unplugging one pole 's worth of the @entity17 's central air conditioning system			1
but far less attention has been placed on what a naked @entity19 means for its closest neighboring ecosystem : the @entity2 tundra			1
beyond the images of icebergs and stranded polar bears , i doubt many people picture the @entity2 's vast carpet of lush green plants , chirping songbirds or highs in the mid- 70s -- all of which are typical of summertime on the tundra			1
with climate changing at an alarming rate and sea ice extent slipping away , the tundra stands to change a lot , and this , too , will affect the rest of the planet			1
it is time to start familiarizing ourselves with the tundra , and here 's why			2
the tundra biome is huge , covering 15 % more of the @entity17 's surface than all 50 @entity51 states combined			1
currently , it stores a significant proportion of the @entity17 's carbon in its permanently frozen soils , keeping it locked away and unable to contribute to the atmosphere 's giant pool of greenhouse gases			1
opinion : why we should look to the @entity2 however , in much the same way that other bodies of water keep coastal cities such as @entity66 from having extremely cold winters and scorching hot summers , sea ice conditions in the @entity19 influence weather patterns over the nearby tundra			1
less sea ice is associated with warmer and drier summer conditions on the tundra			2
consistently balmier summers will cause soils to warm and thaw to greater depths , unleashing long - stored carbon into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide and methane , both of which are potent greenhouse gases			1
the previous record low in @entity19 ice cover occurred in 2007 , and the hot , dry summer that accompanied it on the @entity91 tundra was highlighted by the largest , longest lasting and most severe tundra fire to burn in northern @entity91 in recorded history			0
the fire covered an area roughly 10 % larger than @entity96 and burned for 2Â½ months			0
although lightning frequently strikes the tundra , the landscape is typically fairly moist and so rarely ignites , and even when it does , the flames do n't spread very far , burn very deeply or remain alight for very long			0
but the tundra was very dry in 2007 and fire - fueling winds kicked up the blaze			0
during this single event , the immediate combustion of plants and soils and the thawing of frozen soils injected an enormous amount of carbon into the atmosphere â € ” an amount equivalent to what the entire tundra biome typically absorbs from the atmosphere through plant growth every year			1
the effect of diminishing sea ice is n't limited to increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations			0
warmer conditions on the tundra trigger a cascade of change , including converting its lush but short green carpet into a taller shag , since warmer soils and deeper thaw enable taller , woody plants to grow and thrive on the tundra			2
what my colleagues and i are discovering from our own work in @entity91 tundra is that this shift in vegetation cover has implications -- some good , some bad -- for the animals that depend on it for food and shelter			0
opinion : extreme weather and a changing climate each spring many species of migratory songbirds travel to the @entity2 tundra from all over the world to breed			2
some nest in patches of tall vegetation and may stand to benefit from the expanding taller shag , but those that nest in short vegetation may not be able to adapt			0
what may likely benefit all species is that the taller vegetation harbors significantly more bugs to eat			0
we do n't yet know which species will benefit , and which will suffer in response to the changes , but because each species plays a specific ecological role on the tundra , the downfall of one species or proliferation of another could have a domino effect that disrupts the tundra 's delicate food web			0
and in case you thought that what happens on the tundra stays on the tundra , consider that many of the sparrows , robins and warblers that visit our backyards in winter , or pass through come fall and spring , spend their summers breeding on the tundra ; so , whatever happens to them there will affect which ones and how many of them show up at your bird feeder in the future , potentially setting off a local domino effect			0
since the @entity2 as a whole is responding to climate change earlier and more acutely than the rest of the planet , we should think of it as an early warning system -- a proverbial canary in a coalmine			2
perhaps if we pay closer attention to how the tundra is changing , we can learn some practical lessons on what types of changes to expect here at lower latitudes , which would enable us to mitigate the consequences , or at least plan for how to cope with them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			0

@entity213 : @entity2 sea at lowest extent recorded , affecting @entity17 's *ability* to cool
but , she says , change to sea 's neighboring tundra ecosystem is also a big global - warming worry
the tundra locks up carbon in frozen soils ; when they thaw , huge amounts *released*
@entity213 : tundra also a vast habitat ; thawing will have far - reaching effects around globe
