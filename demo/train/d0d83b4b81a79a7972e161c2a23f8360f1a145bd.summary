with no competition this weekend , the @entity4 pulled in about $ 55 million domestically in 3,924 locations — on target with studio estimates , but far below tracking projections , some of which went so far as to predict an $ 80 million weekend			1
with the majority of screens showing the @entity20 tentpole in @entity21 , the movie averaged about $ 14,016 per screen on an estimated budget of $ 120 million , so this weekend 's performance is really nothing to scoff at			1
interestingly , at $ 55 million , the film is right in line with 2011 ′ s @entity28 : @entity29 which made $ 55.1 million in its first three days at the box office in early june			1
but so far the @entity4 is holding steady as the second lowest opening of all of @entity20 's six x-men movies — that title goes to the first in the series which opened at $ 54.5 million			1
but @entity28 was also released 13 years ago with no @entity21 surcharges , so it 's not an entirely fair comparison			0
the @entity4 opened internationally this weekend as well to grosses of $ 86.1 million , playing on 15,152 screens in 101 territories , bringing its worldwide total to about $ 141.1 million			1
@entity20 estimates that audiences were about 58 percet male , and 42 percent under the age of 25			0
@entity0 : ' @entity4 ' claws its way to a $ 21 million friday the @entity48 held its ground in second place with $ 22.1 million , gaining momentum throughout the weekend			1
it fell only 47.1 percent from its opening last week			0
the r - rated $ 20 million horror movie has made about $ 83.9 million so far , making it director @entity54 's biggest film to date , surpassing even the adjusted grosses for 2004 @entity57 , which clocked in at $ 72.5 million			1
in third place , @entity59 continues to rack in the profits , earning $ 16 million despite losing nearly 344 theaters			1
but the big story is that @entity64 's $ 76 million sequel has passed the $ 300 million mark after 26 days in theaters , and can now boast a domestic profit of about $ 306.4 million and a worldwide total of $ 660.9 million			1
currently , it 's the second - highest - grossing movie of the past year , trailing behind @entity70 3 by about $ 100 million			2
@entity71 fell about 37.5 percent from its opening weekend and earned an estimated $ 13.3 million to take fourth place			1
despite a respectable second - week drop , the animated , radioactive snail story still floundered out of the gates			0
with an estimated budget of $ 135 million , the @entity78 - voiced family movie has only made about $ 55.8 million so far , and things are n't going to get easier as the weeks go by			2
the little blue guys are coming , after all			0
@entity83 2 opens wide on wednesday and could be the death knell for poor @entity71			0
@entity0 : casting net - meet your new @entity86 rounding out the top five is @entity90 's @entity89 with $ 11.5 million , edging the domestic grosses for the raunchy , star - studded comedy past the $ 100 million mark			1
amazingly , it 's still only @entity90 's 15th - highest - grossing moving , but it has been in theaters for just three weeks , so there 's room to grow			0
@entity98 and @entity99 , both @entity101 movies , expanded their theater counts this weekend			2
playing in 1,064 theaters , @entity104 's @entity98 made the top 10 with weekend grosses of about $ 4.7 million , and an overall domestic total of $ 6.3 million			1
@entity109 's independent drama chronicling the true story of @entity113 resident @entity111 's last day won the @entity114 and the @entity115 at this year 's @entity101			0
the themes and events are also quite resonant with current events , and could perhaps be another factor as to why the film is performing so well			0
meanwhile , @entity99 , from the writing , directing , and acting team of @entity123 and @entity124 ( who won an @entity126 for their adapted screenplay for @entity128 ) , expanded to 886 theaters and took the 11th spot with $ 918k			2
the @entity131 , @entity133 's first major starring role , opened in 591 theaters and earned an estimated $ 1.5 million — right on track with estimates from @entity137			1
with a production budget of $ 1.5 million as well , the r - rated sex comedy also stars @entity140 and @entity141			2
finally , @entity143 's latest , @entity142 , opened in six theaters in @entity145 and @entity146 and brought in $ 613k , with a stunning $ 102k per - theater average			2
starring @entity148 as a fallen 1 percenter , @entity143 's well - reviewed elegant ode to wealth , mental illness , and happiness is one of the first films of the year to elicit earnest @entity126 buzz			0
despite its @entity158 rating , it 's also one of the few serious adult films in theaters at the moment			0
check back in next weekend for more summer box office			2
the @entity83 2 opens wide on wednesday , and the @entity165 and @entity166 display of machismo and firearms @entity169 hits 2,800 theaters on friday			0
