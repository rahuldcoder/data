as the search for a missing @entity3 jet entered a sixth day thursday , investigators remained uncertain about its whereabouts			1
here 's a summary of what we know and what we do n't know about flight 370 , which was carrying 239 people when it disappeared from radar screens over @entity13			1
the @entity14 what we know : the @entity16 took off from @entity17 , the @entity18 capital , at 12:41 a.m. saturday ( 12:41 p.m. friday et )			1
it was scheduled to arrive in @entity21 at 6:30 a.m. the same day , after a roughly 2,700 - mile ( 4,350 - kilometer ) journey			1
but around 1:30 a.m. , air traffic controllers in @entity24 , outside @entity17 , lost contact with the plane over the sea between @entity18 and @entity28			1
what we do n't know : what happened next			0
the pilots did not indicate any problem to the tower , and no distress signal was issued			0
@entity18 military officials cite radar data as suggesting the plane might have changed course			1
but the pilots did n't tell air traffic control that they were doing so			0
@entity18 officials say they are still trying to determine if a radar blip detected heading west soon after the plane lost contact was in fact the missing jet			1
if it was , the plane would have been hundreds of miles off its original flight path and headed in the wrong direction			1
@entity18 officials say they have asked @entity49 experts to help them analyze the radar data			1
we do n't know why the plane would have turned around			1
while one expert tells @entity57 the plane 's possible deviation could mean someone deliberately turned the plane around , another expert says power failure could have disrupted the main transponder and its backup , and the plane could have flown for more than an hour			1
adding to the puzzle , the @entity64 reported thursday that the plane may have kept flying for a further four hours after its last reported contact			1
the newspaper attributed the information to two unidentified people who were citing data automatically transmitted to the ground from the passenger jet 's engines			1
@entity57 has so far been unable to confirm the report			0
' we have to find the aircraft ' the passengers what we know : there were 239 people on board : 227 passengers and 12 crew members			0
five of the passengers were younger than 5 years old			0
those on board included a number of painters and calligraphers , as well as employees of an @entity49 semiconductor company			0
according to the airline , the passengers ' 14 nationalities spanned the @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			0
passengers from @entity101 or @entity102 numbered 154 , followed by @entity18 , at 38			1
there were three @entity49 citizens on the plane			1
four passengers had valid booking to travel but did not show up for the flight , according to the airline			0
" as such , the issue of off - loading unaccompanied baggage did not arise , " it added tuesday in a prepared statement			1
what we do n't know : whether any of the passengers had anything to do with the plane 's disappearance			2
friends tell of fears as hopes dim for passengers the passport mystery what we know : two passengers boarded the plane using stolen passports			2
authorities have identified them as @entity130 , 18 , and @entity131 , 29 , both @entity132			0
@entity18 police believe @entity130 was trying to emigrate to @entity134 using the stolen @entity136 passport			1
the men entered @entity18 on february 28 using valid @entity132 passports , according to @entity139			1
the use of the stolen passports had raised concern that the people who used them might be involved in the plane 's disappearance			2
but officials have said they think it is unlikely the @entity132 men had links to terrorist groups			2
@entity18 police said @entity130 's mother contacted them after her son did n't arrive in @entity153 as expected			1
" the more information we get , the more we 're inclined to conclude that it was not a terrorist incident , " @entity154 , the secretary general of the international police organization @entity139 , said tuesday			0
what we do n't know : more details about the two men , particularly @entity131			0
@entity18 officials and @entity139 also gave slightly different information for @entity130 's name and age			1
it was unclear what caused the discrepancy			0
would - be immigrants have used fake passports to try to enter @entity173 countries in the past			2
and @entity13 is known as a booming market for stolen passports			0
the security screening what we know : @entity139 says the passports were listed as stolen in its database			0
but they had not been checked from the time they were entered into the database and the time the plane departed			2
@entity154 said it was " clearly of great concern " that passengers had been able to board an international flight using passports listed as stolen in the agency 's database			0
what we do n't know : whether the passports had been used to travel previously			0
@entity139 says it 's " unable to determine on how many other occasions these passports were used to board flights or cross borders			2
" @entity18 authorities are investigating the security process at the airport in @entity17 , but have insisted it meets international standards			1
how does a jet go missing ? the crew what we know : the crew members are @entity18			1
the pilot is capt. @entity210 , a 53 - year - old veteran with 18,365 flying hours who joined @entity3 in 1981			1
the first officer , @entity212 , has 2,763 flying hours			2
@entity212 , 27 , started at the airline in 2007			0
he had been flying another jet and was transitioning to the @entity16 777 - 200 after having completed training in a flight simulator			2
what we do n't know : what went on in the cockpit around the time the plane lost contact with air traffic controllers			1
the passenger jet was in what is considered the safest part of a flight , the cruise portion , when it disappeared			0
the weather conditions were reported to be good			0
aviation experts say it 's particularly puzzling that the pilots did n't report any kind of problems before contact was lost			1
the search what we know : dozens of ships and planes from various countries have been scouring the @entity243 near where the plane was last detected			1
debris spotted in the area has turned out to be unrelated to the plane			1
similarly , an oil slick in the search area was determined to be from fuel oil typically used in cargo ships , not from the plane			1
@entity28 searchers found no trace thursday of " suspected floating objects " detected in @entity101 satellite imagery near the plane 's last confirmed location			2
what we do n't know : whether the search is concentrating on the right place			2
authorities initially focused their efforts around the mouth of the @entity268 , near the plane 's last known position			2
but they have expanded efforts westward , off the other coast of the @entity274 , and northward into the @entity275 , part of the @entity277			0
on wednesday , authorities announced that they 'd widened the search area to nearly 27,000 square nautical miles ( 35,000 square miles )			1
@entity279 was ' at safest point ' in flight the cause what we know : nothing			0
" for the aircraft to go missing just like that ... as far as we are concerned , we are equally puzzled as well , " @entity286 , director general of the @entity287 , said this week			0
the aircraft model in question , the @entity16 , has an excellent safety record			0
what we do n't know : until searchers find the plane and its voice and data recorders , it may be difficult to figure out what happened			1
@entity57 national security analyst @entity300 says the range of possible reasons behind the disappearance can be divided into three categories : mechanical failure , pilot actions and terrorism			0
but all we have are theories			0
the precedent what we know : it 's rare , but not unprecedented , for a commercial airliner to disappear in midflight			0
in june 2009 , @entity314 was en route from @entity316 to @entity317 when communications ended suddenly from the @entity319 , another state - of - the - art aircraft , with 228 people on board			2
it took five days to locate the first piece of debris from that plane -- and nearly two years to find the bulk of @entity314 's wreckage and most of the bodies in a mountain range deep in the @entity331			2
it took even longer to establish the cause of the disaster			0
what we do n't know : whether what happened to the missing @entity3 plane is similar to what happened to the @entity340 flight			2
investigators attributed the flight 447 crash to a series of errors by the pilots and their failure to react effectively to technical problems			0
