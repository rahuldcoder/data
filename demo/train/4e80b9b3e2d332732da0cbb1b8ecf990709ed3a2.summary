@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 acknowledges that " execution , " inspired by the bloody @entity7 crackdown in 1989 , is the most politically sensitive of his work			1
a section of @entity3 's " execution , " which the artist shows how human conflict is worth laughing at but while @entity7 served as the catalyst , the oil painting should not be seen as depicting what happened at @entity7 , the @entity13 - based artist said this week through a translator in a phone interview			1
billed by @entity19 as " among the most historically important paintings of the @entity1 avant - garde ever to appear at auction , " " execution " had been tucked away from sight until now			1
its owner bought it from a gallery in @entity0 a decade ago under condition that the painting not be shown in public because of its subject matter , according to @entity19 's			1
on friday , it went on auction in @entity34 , a highlight in a contemporary arts sale that also included @entity39 's " @entity38 ( @entity37 ) , " @entity41 's " @entity42 ) " , @entity43 's " @entity40 , " @entity46 's " studies of @entity45 , " and @entity48 's " @entity47			2
" " execution " would become the most expensive work of @entity1 contemporary art at auction , selling for 2.9 million @entity51 pounds ( $ 5.9 million )			1
it eclipsed @entity3 's previous record , set in june when his " the pope " sold for nearly 2.15 million @entity51 pounds ( $ 4.37 million )			1
the sale of " execution " also comes on the same week another @entity3 piece , " @entity59 , " sold for nearly $ 4.1 million at a @entity19 's auction of contemporary @entity1 art in @entity0			1
stretching across " execution " is a long red building , suggesting @entity7 's gate outside the @entity65			1
is the painting of @entity7 ? " i want the audience not to think of one thing or one place or one event , " he said from his @entity13 home			1
" the whole world 's the background			1
" the red building , he explains , is simply something that 's familiar to him as a @entity1 artist			1
" as i said , the viewer should not link this painting to @entity7			2
but @entity7 is the catalyst for conceiving of this painting			1
" the background may make people think of @entity7 because he is a @entity1 artist			1
" but it should not be , " he said			0
@entity3 painted " execution " in a month -- in 1995			2
however , " it took me quite a long time for me to put the idea together			0
" the big picture , he said , " it 's on the whole world 's human conflict that is worth laughing about			1
" drawing references to @entity97 's " @entity96 , 1808 : the execution of the @entity101 " and @entity104 's " @entity102 of @entity103 , " the painting depicts a mock execution			2
@entity104 , it must be pointed out , modeled his painting after @entity97 's ; and @entity3 's " execution " mirrors both of those -- but with his trademark grinning clones , all likenesses of @entity3 himself			1
and the men in the position of being shot are shown in their underwear			0
" people feel freedom , most themselves , at home in their underpants , " @entity3 said			2
and whereas in @entity97 's painting , the man 's hands are up in resistance , the men 's hands in " execution " are down			2
" they are not fearing death , " @entity3 said			2
" the laughs illustrate my deep feelings , " he said			0
the viewer will feel happiness but also fear toward the future and the unknown , a universal sentiment , he said			0
" one might be very happy now but always unsure of what 's going to happen next			0
" i think @entity1 and the world have similar feelings in this respect , " he said			2
as for the main figures that dominate the right - half of the painting , they assume the position of holding the guns , but without the guns themselves			0
" in my painting , they 're pretending to hold guns , as if playing a game			0
" the man on the far right , holding one hand to his chest and another by his waist , is a direct reference to the man on the far right - hand side of @entity104 's painting : in that , he is cocking a gun			2
@entity3 disagrees with the notion that his paintings are a veiled criticism of his government or of @entity1 society , and he does not believe that this work will bring him trouble			1
" i think the painting expresses my feelings			0
it 's not a criticism , " he said , describing himself as not having strong political leanings			0
" i was trying to express my confusion over what i see			0
" the world has similar problems , he said			0
@entity3 said he does not agree with being tagged a " @entity179 , " a term coined by leading art critic @entity181 to describe @entity1 's @entity183 generation of disillusioned artists			1
at the same time , he does n't concern himself about what people call him , he said			0
that his painting has political undertones is inevitable , he said			0
" i can not recall any event that has shaped my political views , but politics is everywhere in @entity1 life , like the meal you eat every day , " he said			2
of @entity1 , he said , " i think it is full of hope , but there are a lot of difficulties , too			0
@entity1 has a long cultural history and also faces a lot of problems right now			0
right now , people are not satisfied , but we can find our way out			0
" @entity3 sold " execution " to @entity0 art dealer @entity207 shortly after painting it			1
" it sold for about $ 5,000 , " @entity3 said			1
" probably not any cent would come back to me , " he said of the millions his paintings now garner at auctions			0
now 45 , @entity3 said he learned about other artists through reading books after 1978 , when @entity1 had begun to open itself up under new leader @entity217 's " open door policy			1
" the decade - long @entity218 that had preceded made reading books an impossibility			0
and what is the meaning behind the cloned figures that bear his likeness in all his paintings ? " because i want to be famous			0

new : " execution " sold for $ 5.9 million , a record for contemporary @entity1 art
@entity3 : @entity7 was catalyst for " execution , " but painting does not depict it
the big picture is , the world 's human conflict is worth laughing at , @entity3 says
