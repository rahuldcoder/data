-- ousted @entity2 president @entity1 will be granted safe passage to the @entity4 as a guest , resolving a diplomatic impasse that kept him trapped in @entity2 , @entity4 president @entity7 said wednesday			1
@entity1 , who has been staying at the @entity9 embassy in @entity2 , would leave for the @entity4 on tuesday , @entity7 said			1
the deal was reached with @entity2 president - elect @entity11 , with the defeated presidential candidates in last november 's election signing the accord as witnesses			0
@entity11 takes office next week			0
granting @entity1 safe conduct out of @entity2 , where he is wanted on charges of abuse of power , is the first step toward re-engaging @entity2 with the international community that repudiated the coup , @entity11 said at a news conference thursday			2
despite polls showing that amnesty for @entity1 remains unpopular , @entity11 said that having an ex-president locked up inside an embassy is not the kind of image that will move the country forward			0
the agreement will allow @entity1 , his family , and members of his inner circle to leave for the @entity4 as guests , rather than under political asylum , a fine point that derailed previous efforts at negotiating his exit			1
" this is an exit with dignity , " @entity7 said , adding that @entity1 has indicated that his final destination likely will be @entity42			1
@entity1 was ousted in a june 28 coup			0
after spending months in exile , @entity1 sneaked back into @entity2 in september , and has not left the @entity9 embassy			1
his return was an effort to restart talks to negotiate his return as president			0
an agreement was eventually signed , but its implementation has been half - hearted , and @entity1 later called the deal dead			0
a previous effort for @entity1 's exit , a petition from @entity42 last month , was rejected by the de facto government of @entity61 because it did not give @entity1 the status of having been granted political asylum .			2
