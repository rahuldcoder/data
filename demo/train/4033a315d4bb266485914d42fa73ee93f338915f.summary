-- it goes on every day , in every county in the @entity3			1
usually there 's no wait to get in			2
and it can be as compelling as anything on television			2
the @entity11 trial in which @entity12 stands accused of murdering @entity13 is attracting large tv audiences			1
the @entity16 trial got the country accustomed to watching high - profile court proceedings gavel - to - gavel ; the trial of @entity20 drew big ratings before the @entity12 trial			1
viewers return because they find the events almost hypnotic : something that thoroughly captures their attention			2
but one of the so - omnipresent - that - we - seldom - think - about - it facts of @entity3 life is just how much human intrigue , how much tension , how much weakness and heroism and sadness and triumph are on continuous and ever - changing display in multiple and seemingly mundane settings all over the country , each day of the workweek			1
and how relatively few people choose to sit in the first - come , first - served seats and take it all in			0
the courtrooms of this nation , both criminal and civil , are bright stages upon which the theater of murder , deceit , heartbreak and duplicity are played out in excruciating and breathtaking detail			1
in @entity12 's trial , it 's a jury of millions if you 're of a mind to , you can find on those stages narratives as spellbinding as any murder mystery in a bookstore or any crime drama in a movie theater			1
as a citizen , you can immerse yourself in the tale , day after day			0
you have to have a little spare time on your hands -- maybe a few days away from work -- and you have to choose a case that most interests you from among the many that are going on at the same moment in the courthouse in your community			0
the clerk 's office will have a calendar of the day 's trials , and court employees can be helpful in explaining to you what is transpiring in the various rooms			1
trials tend to have ebbs and flows , and there will be times when you have to be willing to sit through lulls			2
but you will view and hear things more enthralling , more disturbing , more enlightening and more repellent than you might ever have imagined			0
as a citizen in the seats , you will almost inevitably find yourself becoming a part of the cast of characters of the courtroom			0
a tangential part , to be sure			0
but after a few days the attorneys will begin to recognize you , as will the defendants , and the judge , and the bailiffs			0
you may begin to feel something close to a responsibility to show up -- a responsibility to yourself , not to miss a minute of the story you have started to follow			0
why do n't more people , especially those who have the time , avail themselves of this opportunity ? perhaps because they seldom stop to think it 's there			2
when a big trial makes it to tv , the assumption is that it has some special quality to attract that spotlight			1
that may be partially true			0
but although the sensational trials draw audiences because they 're on television , there is so much to see and feel in the courtrooms of even the smallest cities and towns			1
the matters that bring people to trial -- whether acts of shattering violence , double - dealing in business transactions , any of the hundreds of variations of robbery and theft -- find their way to virtually every crossroads , and thus eventually into virtually every courthouse			1
mom vs. mom in the @entity12 trial you can be captivated by just how skilled some attorneys are -- and surprised by just how ill - prepared some others are			1
you 'll study the judge -- his or her shifting moods -- as if he or she is the protagonist in a paperback potboiler			0
you 'll make eye contact with the defendants and the jury members			0
and there is nothing quite like the moment when that jury returns with its verdict			0
this is a country that somehow becomes giddy when two singers face off in a televised talent contest , and one goes on to the next round while the other goes home			0
that feeling pales compared to the sensation of sitting in a courtroom , your vital signs kicking into a higher gear as the judge asks the foreman if there is a decision , and the seconds drag on before the words are read aloud			0
the best part of the experience is that it 's not taking place on a cold screen in front of millions of distant , unseen viewers -- it is unfolding a few feet from your eyes			2
most cases , even in medium - sized towns , are n't covered by the local newspapers ; there are just too many courtrooms for that			1
but the curtain rises every morning , in public buildings everywhere in the @entity3 and , beyond the raw fascination of what goes on , there is another , much more vital , reason to attend : because someone should bear witness			1
because this is @entity3 justice , carried out in all of our names			1
and anyone who cares to be there is always cordially invited			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			2

@entity205 : @entity12 trial *riveting* , but why limit yourself to tv trials ?
he says in county and local courtrooms across @entity3 , trials constantly on display . go watch !
he says subjects are murder , robbery , financial *shenanigans* ; it 's free , tense , fascinating
@entity205 : beyond that , it 's @entity3 justice carried out for us all ; *important* to bear witness
