-- as her friends , her family and the world celebrated @entity5 last weekend , i am struck by the imprint she left on me			1
@entity5 was a shining example of how powerful and strong , good and giving , courageous and dignified , gracious and lovely a human being can be			1
her generosity of spirit is truly beautiful			1
whether she was doing an interview with a stranger or talking to a friend , she was so giving of her spirit , always making whomever she was talking with feel important and lifted up			1
being around her made you want to be the best you could be , because she saw the best we could be			1
and she was like a bright and shining mirror			2
because she saw the best in us , we could see it in ourselves			2
and once we saw it we had a responsibility to live it			2
we were talking once about writing songs and why i had been hesitant for so long to really jump in and write my own songs			2
she said , " sometimes it 's not the fear of failing at something that holds us back			2
it 's the fear of succeeding			2
because we know that once we take that step and do whatever we 've been holding back and succeed at it , the world will expect more of us			0
@entity5 's wisdom and generosity of spirit inspired us all			1
what if she had hid that light ? she was brave enough and open enough and strong enough to share her brilliant mind and spirit with the whole world			0
and we are all better for it			0
she made no secret she was a fan of music and particularly a fan of country music			1
i was beyond honored that she said she liked my music and me , as a woman			0
" everything you sing , " she once said , " sounds like it comes from your heart			0
" how awesome is that , and to come from @entity5 ! @entity5 also shared her wisdom through her words			1
one of my favorite phrases of hers is : " ca n't do is like do n't care			0
neither of them have a home			0
" but perhaps my very favorite words were the last words she spoke to me			0
" come visit me in my home			0
i will cook for you			0
" thank you , @entity5			1
you forever changed my world -- our world , the whole world -- for the better			1
