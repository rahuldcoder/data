we need to tone down the rhetoric and rally in support of law enforcement and against lawlessness			0
" the rhetoric @entity70 was referring to is n't confined to the angry words and sometimes violent clashes between police and protesters after @entity93 was shot to death in @entity95 , @entity96 , or the @entity57 death of @entity98 after police attempted to subdue him , which also spurred national protests , said @entity9 spokesman @entity101			2
