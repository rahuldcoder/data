@entity0 -- the @entity3 government is stepping up its involvement in the @entity6 crisis after allegations of chemical weapons use -- with its top military official making plans to respond quickly , and its top diplomat reaching out to @entity6 's foreign minister and others in the wake of the report			1
on saturday , a senior @entity17 official said that secretary of state @entity18 had talked thursday -- the day after the attack -- with @entity6 foreign minister @entity20			1
the purpose of the call was to make clear that if the @entity6 government had nothing to hide , it should have allowed immediate access to the site -- rather than continuing to attack the area to block access and destroy evidence , the official said			1
meanwhile , the @entity3 military was busy in its own right			1
if claims that @entity6 used chemical weapons this week are true , a speedy response will be needed to prevent another such attack , defense secretary @entity33 said friday			1
a senior @entity39 official has told @entity1 that military planners have updated @entity6 target lists			1
and it was disclosed that a fourth @entity3 ship armed with cruise missiles has arrived in the eastern @entity44			1
a @entity46 team is in @entity6 attempting to investigate a claim by the nation 's rebels that a chemical weapons attack by president @entity52 's forces outside @entity53 killed more than 1,300 people			1
@entity55 addressed the issue aboard a military plane headed to @entity58			0
" we will determine at some point here very shortly what did happen , " he said , according to an account posted on the @entity39 's website			0
" if , in fact , this was a deliberate use and attack by the @entity6 government on its own people using chemical weapons , there may be another attack coming , " @entity55 said			1
" a very quick assessment of what happened and whatever appropriate response should be made			0
" @entity55 said the @entity3 military was providing president @entity77 " with options for all contingencies , and that requires positioning our forces [ and ] positioning our assets to be able to carry out whatever options the president might choose			1
" he did not provide specifics on what the options were			0
@entity77 talked saturday with @entity89 prime minister @entity88 about @entity6 , according to a @entity91 statement			2
together expressing " grave concern " about the chemical weapons reports , the two leaders will " consult closely " on the investigation into the incident as well as " possible responses by the international community , " according to the @entity91			2
@entity18 also has been active , reaching out saturday to @entity101 foreign minister @entity100 , @entity103 foreign minister @entity102 , @entity105 foreign minister @entity104 and @entity107 secretary - general @entity106 , a senior @entity17 official said			1
earlier , in a @entity1 exclusive interview with " @entity109 , " @entity77 defended his decision not to intervene militarily in the @entity6 conflict			2
but he predicted that @entity3 focus on the civil war would be necessary for the fighting to come to an end			2
" i think it is fair to say that , as difficult as the problem is , this is something that is going to require @entity3 's attention and hopefully the entire international community 's attention , " @entity77 told @entity1 's @entity116			2
the president has said he does not anticipate using ground forces in @entity6			0
other military options could include airstrikes by fighter jets or cruise missiles			1
the @entity132 destroyer @entity131 has arrived in the region , a defense official said late friday			0
it was intended to replace the @entity135 , but the @entity135 will remain temporarily along with the @entity136 and @entity137			0
all four are equipped with cruise missiles			2
so far , the president has authorized a limited amount of military hardware for the rebels in addition to logistical and humanitarian assistance			0
the senior @entity39 official who spoke to @entity1 said options for direct military action would include targeting @entity52 's capability to deliver chemical weapons			1
@entity152 lists could include government buildings and military installations , the official said , but the military must have flexible plans to target forces and equipment which " continue to move			2
" sen. @entity160 , an advocate for a more forceful @entity3 response to the @entity6 conflict , has suggested that @entity3 air power could take out runways and planes used by @entity52 's forces that he said are " dominating the battlefields and the towns and the cities			1
" @entity160 also has advocated giving rebels anti-aircraft and anti-missile weapons to establish a " no fly zone			0
" but administration officials have cautioned that some @entity6 rebel factions have ties to @entity177 terrorists			0
@entity179 chairman gen. @entity178 said in a letter to a member of @entity182 this week that arming rebels requires " choosing one among many sides			0
" " it is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor			0
today , they are not , " @entity178 wrote			0
