-- there 's a hot new travel site -- but it does n't really arrange any travel			1
the @entity4 blew up wednesday over @entity5 , a site that launched april 9			2
according to its founder , @entity7 , the site connects rich people with good - looking people who want to gallivant around the world on the rich person 's dime			1
" we are a meeting space like a nightclub or a bar for people who are interested in talking , " @entity7 said			2
" this is n't an escort service			1
" @entity7 points out the " escorts are not welcome " disclaimer linked from the home page			0
visitors to @entity5 may miss that message initially when confronted immediately upon arrival by the image taking up most of the home page , a young woman sitting school - girlishly ( short skirt , head tilted ) on a pink suitcase			2
a video play button appears over her			0
click and hear a woman 's voice speaking sexily as a female cartoon delivers the pitch			0
" are you attractive but you do n't have the money to travel ? " she asks			1
" what if you could travel around the world , stay in five - star resorts , dine at top - rated restaurants and do the fun things travelers do , all for free ? " on @entity47 , you can , the voice says			1
male cartoons of doctors , lawyers , bankers , athletes and such pop into the frame , and the voice says , " @entity56 , they have the money , and they are willing to spend it on you			0
" no one on the site has gone on any trips that @entity7 knows about -- mostly because the site is so new -- and @entity65 does not arrange travel , he said			1
like a dating site , @entity47 only provides a platform for people to create profiles and communicate			1
there are two categories on @entity47 : " attractive " and " generous			1
" judging from photos of the attractives , they evidently have so little money they ca n't afford many clothes			2
the site offers no promises that a generous will not stick an attractive with any bills			1
it 's up to the two of them to negotiate , @entity7 said			0
the generouses include " @entity86 " who claims to be 27 , worth between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million and from @entity88 , @entity89			0
he is interested in " no strings attached " and going to the @entity91			0
an attractive could also choose a 6 foot 2 inch generous named " @entity92 " from @entity93 or " @entity94 , " who lists himself as single but is open , he indicates , to " @entity98 ( @entity100 / @entity99 ) " and " @entity97			2
" if you register as an attractive , you pay nothing			0
if you 're generous , you pay a minimum of $ 50 to be able to communicate with 10 attractives , @entity7 said			0
for $ 250 , you can communicate with up to 100 attractives			0
@entity7 said the site allows people of all types ; although it 's called @entity47 , men and women , gay and straight are welcome to be either an attractive or a generous			1
when these categories connect , @entity7 said , they should consult the safety guidelines @entity47 provides , such as , " never travel out of the country or to a different city to meet someone you do not know well			1
" something to keep in mind when dealing with " @entity126 " a 30 - year - old from the @entity123 area who asks in his profile , " are you woman enough ? " @entity7 said he was a " nerd growing up in @entity128 " who did n't have a girlfriend or a kiss until he was 21			2
his site is intended , he said , to help people who are shy like him connect			1
he is trying to follow some wisdom his mother shared with him years ago			0
" a little bit of generosity , " he said , " goes a long way when it comes to dating			0
" what do you think ? would you search for travel companions this way ? share your thoughts in the comments below .			0
