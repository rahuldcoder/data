-- the @entity2 will accept @entity4 's invitation to send inspectors to visit its @entity7 heavy - water production plant on december 8 , @entity2 director general @entity1 said thursday			1
" we have not yet answered , but it is for sure that we 'll do this activity , " he told reporters in @entity9 , @entity10			0
" we will visit the site , we will do our necessary activities and we will report the facts to the @entity17 , " he said			0
but , he added , " i 'm not in a position to share the details of the activities -- this is a part of the safeguard activities , verification activities			0
" over the weekend , @entity4 and six world powers , including the @entity26 , reached an interim deal under which @entity4 agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for an easing of economic sanctions			1
as part of the six - month deal , @entity4 is required to dilute its stockpile of uranium enriched to 20 % , halt all enrichment above 5 % and dismantle the technical equipment required to do that enrichment			2
it also agreed to freeze essential work on the heavy - water reactor under construction at @entity7 , southwest of @entity43			1
but @entity1 noted that the invitation applies only to the heavy - water production plant , not the heavy - water reactor			1
though the @entity2 does not have inspectors stationed permanently in @entity4 , it has at minimum a team of two inspectors at any given time , and usually has two teams of two inspectors , he said			2
he added that his agency would probably need help to complete its task			0
" i do n't think we can cover everything by our own budget , " he said			0
the heavy - water reactor has been of concern to international powers because that facility could be used as a source of plutonium -- a second pathway to a potential nuclear bomb			1
questions about the @entity7 reactor 's fate had been a sticking point in earlier negotiations			2
asked about the agreement that @entity4 will provide daily access to inspectors from the @entity2 , @entity1 said , " we would like to understand the objective and we would like to make it meaningful and useful			2
" the inspectors will be expected to visit centrifuge assembly and storage facilities and uranium mills , as well as the @entity7 site			2
@entity4 insists it 's enriching uranium and building nuclear reactors only for peaceful civilian energy needs			0
' welcome step ' the @entity2 has been following a parallel but separate track to the six world powers in negotiations with @entity4			1
this month , the nuclear watchdog and @entity43 agreed on a framework for further cooperation , and the @entity2 said then that its inspectors would carry out a technical visit to the @entity7 plant " in the near future			1
" @entity4 has previously allowed @entity2 inspectors access to the heavy - water reactor at @entity7 , said @entity98 , a research fellow at the @entity100 - based @entity99 think tank , so the latest visit is a " welcome step " in terms of increased transparency but may not reveal much that 's new			1
the big question is n't about inspection of the heavy - water reactor , which is not yet operational , but rather what might happen to it in the longer term , @entity98 said			1
what concerns many in the international community is that the reactor is a type that some other countries have used to make nuclear weapons , he said			0
for that to happen , the spent fuel must be reprocessed to extract the plutonium			0
@entity4 's agreement to freeze work at the @entity7 plant is more significant than it allowing the inspectors in , @entity98 said			1
@entity43 has said the plant could be operational next year , although most analysts believe its activation would be a lot further off , he said			0
the @entity26 and other world powers do not want to see it ever switched on and would prefer @entity4 to turn it into a safer , light - water reactor , which produces less plutonium , he said			1
for its part , @entity4 has said it wo n't build a reprocessing plant next to the reactor			0
the inspectors ' work in visiting the centrifuges used to enrich uranium may ultimately prove more important than monitoring the @entity7 plant , @entity98 said			2
" the issue at the end of the day is going to be whether @entity4 allows the @entity2 more transparency in exploring alleged military aspects , its alleged nuclear weapons program , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity145 contributed to this report .			0
