@entity1 , @entity0 -- as the snow started falling , i drove to @entity5 to pick up some groceries			1
with a storm on the way , i needed to stock up on supplies in case we got snowed in			1
i pulled into the parking lot of the store and found a spot right in front of the entrance			1
i sat there for a few minutes , collecting what i needed to take in			1
as i reached over to the passenger seat to grab my wallet , i glanced over at the car next to me through the passenger window and saw three people who were loading their groceries into their car			1
i also saw a large man standing there , reaching over the hood of their car			1
he was wiping the snow and ice off the car 's windshield with his bare hands			1
the owner of the vehicle looked at him with an icy stare that seemed to say , " how dare you touch my car			1
" she seemed disgusted just breathing the same air as the man cleaning her windshield			1
instead of asking him to stop or giving him a few dollars , she quickly climbed into her car and gunned the car forward so fast the man was knocked back			1
a few seconds later , the man got up , walked to my car and knocked on my window			1
i had n't even processed what i had just witnessed			1
now he was coming over to me and i had no idea what to say			1
" please , not now , i just want to get what i need and get home , " i thought to myself			1
where i live , it 's common for people to approach you for money			2
i took a deep breath and started to open the door			2
the man opened it the rest of the way , being careful not to hit the car next to me			1
this man stood well over 6 feet and wore sweatpants , a light flannel shirt and boots that were left untied			1
it was roughly 20 degrees outside and he was clearly not dressed for the cold			2
in a rather abrupt voice , he broke the silence by asking , " can i have your change ? " i scooped up the change i had in the car and gave him everything i had , which was only $ 2.37			2
after handing him the money , i explained that i did n't have any more			2
" i 'm cold and hungry			2
can you take me to the shelter ? " he asked			2
they were at his side but his fingers moved silently up and down , as though he was playing an invisible piano			2
he spoke with great difficulty -- in a stilted , mechanical fashion and his face showed no emotion			2
i never felt threatened , although he stood in my personal space about 1 or 2 feet in front of me			2
he would occasionally look in my direction , but never at me			2
although he stood so close , he avoided eye contact			2
" can you drive me to the shelter ? because it 's warm there and they have food , " he asked me again			2
" i 'm homeless and very hungry , " he said			1
" i 'm not lying to you			2
if i lie to you then you might not help me			2
" i really did n't know what to say , because i was n't comfortable driving him anywhere			2
then he asked me to buy him some food and gloves			2
i thought about what to say			2
i knew he would have a hard time understanding : i do n't have any money			0
my family is struggling to survive each day			0
i was trying to figure out how to explain to him that i could n't help , but i was at a loss for words			0
then something happened that shook me to the core and completely broke my heart			0
as i was trying to tell him no , he looked me in the eyes			0
all of a sudden , i was looking at my oldest son			0
my wife and i have three boys with autism ; the oldest is 12			1
looking at the bare - handed man was like looking through some special window at my oldest son , 20 or 30 years from now			1
it was like being run over by a freight train			0
i was washed by a wave of clarity and my eyes and heart were now open to what was happening in front of me			0
suddenly i was transformed from a person trying to avoid the whole situation into a parent , filled with compassion and understanding			0
he again asked me to buy him food because he was hungry and gloves because his hands were cold			0
something about him was so familiar			0
yes , i would buy him some food			0
i would never deny any of my children food if they were hungry			1
he smiled in my direction and took my hand without looking at me and led me into the store			0
his hands were cold , hardened and chapped			0
i noticed the looks people gave me as i walked with the bare - handed man into the grocery store			1
his clothes were old , beaten up and had a foul odor			0
he asked me to buy him a gift card so he could buy food later , when he would be hungry again			0
so we walked over to the rack and he picked out a @entity5 gift card			0
i put $ 25 on the gift card			0
i gave him $ 25 in cash and asked him to please buy some gloves and a bus ride to the shelter			0
he asked for the receipt so " when the police stop me , i can prove i did n't steal this			0
" he told me again that he was n't lying			0
i told him i knew he was n't			0
he turned to walk away , stopped and looked in my direction as if to say " thank you , " but did n't			0
what he did said more than a simple thank you			0
he showed me his eyes again for a brief moment before he turned around and left			0
i was beside myself with grief			0
how could someone i did n't know have such a profound effect on me ? it took everything i had not to burst into tears			0
i just could n't shake just how much the bare - handed man reminded me of my oldest son			1
their eyes , mannerisms and even the way they speak were so similar			0
my son struggles with boundaries and personal space simply because he does n't understand , not because he wants to be invasive			0
all i could think was , " how does this happen ? " i was smacked in the face with reality			1
related story : parents of autistic children who " take nothing for granted " someday i wo n't be here to take care of my children			1
what if this happens to them ? what if they are the ones wiping off a windshield with their bare hands and almost being run over by someone who does n't care ? i ca n't let that happen			1
i wo n't let that happen			1
since that cold february day in 2011 , i have met the bare - handed man on a few more occasions			1
along the way , i learned that his name is @entity220 and that he remembers me			0
@entity220 has shown me just how much work still needs to be done			0
i would like to think that my experience that day -- the way people treated @entity220 in that frozen parking lot -- was an isolated incident			0
sadly , i know it 's not			0
things like this happen all the time			1
to this writer and father of three beautiful boys on the autism spectrum , this is simply unacceptable			1
we need to do what we can to help the world better understand both children and adults with autism			1
i 'm terrified of what the future might hold for my children			1
i have witnessed how cruel and unforgiving the world can be to people who are perceived as different			0
it is an ugly reality but one i 'm working to help change			0
please help spread autism awareness , even if it 's one person at a time			1
remember that the autistic children of today will be the autistic adults of tomorrow			1
these people need and deserve our compassion , understanding and respect			0
let 's help to ensure that what happened to my friend @entity220 in the parking lot of the @entity5 does n't have to happen to anyone else , ever again			1
