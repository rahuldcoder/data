-- one of @entity3 's most prolific writers , novelist @entity1 proves to be a " @entity4 " herself			1
born in @entity5 , @entity3 , the novelist , short - story writer and children 's author is the daughter of a @entity12 father and @entity14 mother			1
( she is the mother of @entity15 , who also is an award - winning author			1
) with a career spanning four decades , @entity1 has written 14 novels and received numerous literary accolades			1
she has been a finalist for @entity22 's prestigious @entity21 three times			1
her novels include " @entity24 " ( 1980 ) ; " in custody , " which was shortlisted for the @entity21 in 1984 and made into a film ; " @entity27 " ( 1987 ) ; " fasting , feasting " ( 1999 ) ; and " @entity28 " ( 2004 )			1
educated at @entity29 , @entity1 now lives in the @entity30 and is an @entity31 at the @entity32			1
the acclaimed author talks to @entity0 about the inspirations she draws from her homeland			0
@entity0 : what does @entity3 mean to you ? @entity1 : i may think of myself , after so much travel and so many dislocations , as " stateless " but the truth is that wherever i am , i am @entity3 , and wherever i go , i carry @entity3 with me			1
we are inseparable , joined at birth			0
@entity0 : how has the country inspired your work ? @entity47 : @entity3 is the source of all my work			1
i have brought in other countries , other nationalities -- but always in their relation to @entity3			1
@entity0 : how has @entity3 shaped your personality ? @entity47 : when i am in the @entity57 , i feel very @entity3			2
when i am in @entity3 , i feel i have become very westernized			2
i suppose this means i now have a schizophrenic personality			0
@entity0 : where is your favorite place to go in @entity3 ? @entity47 : the @entity63			2
i was born there and never fail to feel exhilarated when i return to those heights			0
@entity0 : what do you miss most about @entity3 ? @entity47 : friendship and family relationships			2
these can never quite be replicated or replaced -- the ease , the familiarity , the intimacy and above all , their history			0
so , yes , the sense of history , of everything being old , rooted in the past			0
@entity0 : how has @entity3 changed in your lifetime ? @entity47 : oh , exponentially ! i see @entity3 as in so many segments of time and experience -- the @entity3 ( @entity89 ) i grew up in and went to school and university in , then the @entity3 ( @entity85 ) to which i returned as an adult with young children , trying hard to replicate the @entity3 i had once known but in a changed landscape			2
and now the @entity3 to which i return after spending more than 30 years away and which is so dreadfully unfamiliar and often uncomfortable that it is almost unrecognizable			0
@entity0 : what does the future hold for @entity3 ? @entity47 : i would have to be a seer to answer that and i am not one			0
neither @entity3 who live in @entity3 nor @entity3 who live abroad and visit know the answer to that			0
all is chaos at the moment , caught between past and present , old and new , traditional and modern , changeless and changing .			0
