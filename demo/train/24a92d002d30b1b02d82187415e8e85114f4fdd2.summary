-- how difficult is it to board a plane with a stolen passport ? not as hard as you might think			2
in any major international airport , it 's not uncommon to have your passport checked four times or more between check - in and boarding the aircraft			2
but if passenger documents are n't checked against @entity15 's database of stolen and lost travel documents , travelers using those documents can slip through layers of security			1
reports that two passengers on missing @entity21 were traveling on stolen @entity23 and @entity24 passports have highlighted security concerns that have troubled @entity15 for years , the international law enforcement agency said sunday			1
the flight , carrying more than 200 passengers , disappeared from radar saturday and has n't been seen or heard from since			2

the men entered @entity35 on february 28 using valid @entity33 passports , @entity15 said			0
" @entity15 is asking why only a handful of countries worldwide are taking care to make sure that persons possessing stolen passports are not boarding international flights , " @entity15 secretary general @entity39 said in a statement			1
before the departure of flight 370 , no country had checked the stolen passports against @entity15 's list since they were added to the lost - documents database in 2012 and 2013 , @entity15 said			1
countries , but not airlines , have access to @entity15 's data , and many governments do n't routinely check passports against the database			2
in 2013 , passengers were able to board planes more than 1 billion times without having their travel documents checked against @entity15 's data , the agency said			1
airlines carried more than 3.1 billion passengers globally in 2013 , according to estimates from the @entity67			0

" the more information we get , the more we 're inclined to conclude that it was not a terrorist incident , " @entity39 said at a news conference in @entity74 , @entity75			0
there 's no evidence to suggest either of the men traveling on the missing @entity54 flight was connected to any terrorist organizations , according to @entity35 investigators			1
on any given day , many people travel using stolen or fake passports for reasons that have nothing to do with terrorism , aviation security expert @entity86 told @entity0			1
they might be trying to immigrate illegally to another country , or they might be smuggling stolen goods , people , drugs or weapons or trying to import otherwise legal goods without paying taxes , said @entity86 , director of terrorism , intelligence and security studies at @entity104			1
" for all of those reasons , the very notion that passports might be important in this particular situation may be a red herring , " @entity86 said			0
@entity39 said sunday that the fact that any passenger was able to board an international flight using a stolen passport listed in @entity15 's databases is a big concern			2
" this is a situation we had hoped never to see , " he said			0
" for years @entity15 has asked why should countries wait for a tragedy to put prudent security measures in place at borders and boarding gates ? " few countries look up stolen passports @entity15 does not charge countries for access to its databases , but some of the 190 @entity15 member countries may not have the technical capacity or resources to access the network , according to @entity134 , a former @entity135 assistant director			1
" it 's just up to the will of the country to set it up and do it , " @entity134 said			0
@entity15 's @entity140 database was created in 2002 , following the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , to help countries secure their borders			0
since then , it has expanded from a few thousand passports and searches to more than 40 million entries and more than 800 million searches per year			0
about 60,000 of those 800 million searches yield hits against stolen or lost documents , according to @entity15			0
the @entity151 searches the database more than 250 million times annually , the @entity155 more than 120 million times annually and the @entity156 more than 50 million times annually , @entity15 said			0
( some 300,000 passports are lost or stolen each year in the @entity151 , according to the @entity159 , which collects reports of stolen passports and sends them to the @entity162 and @entity15			1

it conducts a thorough review of all relevant domestic and international criminal databases , including @entity15 's , for any issues of concern			0
this review includes reports of stolen documents			0
" if @entity54 and all airlines worldwide were able to check the passport details of prospective passengers against @entity15 's database , then we would not have to speculate whether stolen passports were used by terrorists to board mh 370 , " @entity15 's @entity39 said			1
the @entity181 connection the @entity23 and @entity24 passports were stolen in @entity181 in 2012 and 2013 , respectively , according to @entity15			2

@entity184 , who has been working in the region as a security and risk analyst for 14 years , said the situation in @entity181 is better than it was five to 10 years ago " but still not up to international standards			0
" " unfortunately , @entity181 remains a robust venue for the sale of high - quality false passports ( which includes altered stolen passports ) and other supporting documentation , " he said			1
not all " lost " passports are necessarily " stolen " passports , @entity184 said			2
" some passports ' lost ' are actually sold by the passport holder			0
some young men and others traveling to @entity181 , short on cash after extended partying and high living , can be approached to sell a passport , which can be easily replaced at embassies upon presentation of a routine ' lost passport ' police report , " he said			0
