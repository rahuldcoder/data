@entity0 , @entity1 -- regrowing a fingertip cut off in an accident sounds like something from a futuristic movie			1
but with innovative technology developed by the @entity8 , such regrowth is possible today			1
this remotely controlled robot , called @entity11 , could help remove injured soldiers from battlefields			1
this research project and a hundred others were on display this month at the 26th @entity17			1
some the greatest minds in science from around the world gathered at the four - day conference to exchange ideas and showcase collaborative projects between the @entity8 's research laboratories , universities and partner industries			1
the main goal is to develop technology to make soldiers safer and more effective , said @entity30 , the @entity8 's chief scientist			1
the @entity8 's regenerative medicine study combined properties from the intestinal lining and the urinary bladder to create a regenerative substance called @entity36			1
the cream - colored crystallized powder , called " magic dust , " boosts the body 's natural tendency to repair itself , said @entity43 army biological scientist sgt. @entity42			2
when the matrix is applied to a missing digit or limb , " the body thinks it 's back in the womb , " @entity42 said			0
one civilian participated in the regenerative - medicine study after cutting off the tip of his finger in a model plane 's propeller			1
researchers continually applied the matrix to the wound , and after four weeks , the body grew skin and tissue to replenish the damaged area			2
the @entity43 military branches have begun a consortium with private institutions to develop treatments for severely injured troops			2
with the help of grants , the @entity67 is studying nerve and vein transplantation , treating burns without scarring and regeneration of tissue , skin and even bone			1
through both animal studies and civilian clinical trials , the institute is developing therapies for the large number of soldiers injured by improvised explosive devices and other explosives in @entity86 and @entity87			1
" we are working on trying to regenerate limbs , to repair limbs and to keep them from being amputated , " institute project director col. @entity88 said			0
army scientists also have developed an engineered skin substitute made in a laboratory from patients ' own cells			0
a postage stamp - sized patch of skin could grow several times larger than the original sample			2
the engineered skin could then be placed over a wound or burn , protecting it from infection , and eventually cover large portions of the body that have been damaged			0
" our goal is to restore the function to our wounded warriors who have given so much in battle , " @entity88 said			2
@entity67 scientists also say they also have developed a process to rebuild missing or damaged bone			2
a web - like tube of calcium - phosphate ceramic , called hydroxyapatite , acts as a biodegradable scaffold that is set in place of the missing bone , giving the body a platform on which to rebuild			1
scientists say the scaffold allows the body to regrow its own natural tissue , bone and veins so it can support itself			1
because of the complexity of the process , researchers so far have regrown only 3 centimeters of bone in clinical trials on rats , but they hope to reach 5 centimeters in two years			2
with the regrown bone , scientists could avoid placing titanium or other medical devices in the body			0
of course , to apply this technology , the @entity8 needs a way to safely remove injured soldiers from combat zones			1
enter the @entity141 , or @entity11 , a human - shaped machine with eyes , ears and arms for lifting heavy objects			0
built by @entity147 in association with the @entity8 , bear is still a prototype			1
but its potential is promising			0
@entity11 is outfitted with lights , two cameras and infrared abilities , and it can travel up to 10 mph			0
the device also can lift 250 pounds while balancing on its toes			0
@entity147 robotic engineer @entity156 says bear can be remotely operated , reducing the chance of injuries to soldiers ' human rescuers			1
" bear can easily be replaced ; it costs money and not lives , " @entity156 said			0
robot technology has exploded in the past six years , said @entity8 scientist @entity163			1
robot prototypes of all kinds were on display at the conference , and about 10,000 military robots are expected to be deployed in the field in 2009			1
robots can be outfitted to accomplish various tasks			0
one can detect 38 different chemical or biological explosives from a distance of 3 to 5 meters			0
the robot could be used to scan car doors or truck lids for explosives or chemical residue			0
another , called @entity181 , is deployed in @entity87 for surveillance , reconnaissance and explosives removal			0
packbot has been outfitted to react to voice commands , given remotely through an earpiece			0
loud background noises do not distort the commands , because the system monitors the vibrations of the operator 's jawbone			0
finally , some robots come with a retractable apparatus called a @entity196 or @entity197 , which can be equipped with a camera or antenna and raised to peer over walls or send radio communications			0
the smallest @entity196 is not much bigger than a coffee pot and can extend to a height of 8 feet			0
designed by the @entity8 's @entity205 , the larger mast is affixed to tanks and can reach heights over 30 feet .			2
