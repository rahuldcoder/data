-- it is a side of @entity2 the public often does not see -- opening up about his faith , devotion to his family and his work as a @entity9 overseas missionary and later church leader at home			1
in a rare discussion of these topics , he described to @entity0 chief political analyst @entity14 his 2Â½ years as a teenager serving as a church missionary in @entity17			1
he said that period helped " ground my relationship with @entity20 " and cement his beliefs			0
when @entity2 sat down with @entity14 this summer for @entity0 's documentary " @entity2 revealed : @entity31 , @entity32 and the @entity33 , " it was while he was campaigning and fundraising in @entity25 -- and just a day before he secretly met with rep. @entity26 to offer him the @entity28 slot on the @entity30 ticket			1
8 ways faith will matter at the @entity36 while it might be expected @entity2 would be guarded and on message as he is usually is on the campaign trail , he was candid on a range of topics -- from his private life to religion to his wife -- areas he rarely has talked about			1
as he prepares to accept his party 's nomination for president , @entity2 and his team are trying to show the voting public a more personal side of the candidate			1
on a mission in @entity17 describing his mission in @entity17 , he talked about how he would walk the streets of @entity56 up to 60 hours a week trying to convince people why they should convert -- in @entity17			1
often he would have doors slammed in his face			0
the shaping of @entity2 's faith " when you 're off in a foreign place and you only talk to your parents once or twice a year by phone -- that 's all that 's allowed -- and you 're out speaking to people day in and day out about your faith and your religion and differences between your faith and other faiths ... you say , ' ok , what 's important here ? what do i believe ? what 's truth ? is there a @entity20 ? is @entity80 the son of @entity20 ? ' " he told @entity14			1
my take : @entity2 should take reporters to church more often " these are questions that are no longer academic			1
they 're critical because you 're talking about that day in and day out			0
and so i read scripture with much more interest and concern and sought to draw closer to @entity20 through my own prayer			0
and these things drew me closer to the eternal and convinced me that in fact there is a @entity20			0
@entity80 is the son of @entity20 and my savior , and these are things that continue to be important in my life , of course			2
" left for dead what many people do n't know is that during this time he was involved in a car accident as he was driving the mission president and his wife during a six - hour ride between @entity107 and the south of @entity17			1
their car was hit by what was believed to be a drunken driver			2
the mission president had to return to the @entity113 because of his injuries , and his wife was killed			1
initially @entity2 was pronounced dead			1
he told @entity0 this was a time of " challenge and soul searching			0
" " the person sitting next to me died , and others were severely injured			0
my injuries were not as severe as some might have thought			2
the policeman on the scene apparently thought i was in worse condition than i was and wrote , in @entity17 , ' he is dead ' on my passport to distinguish me from others			1
that made it back to the @entity113 in a press report that i had been killed in an accident			1
my parents heard it through the media , as did @entity137 , " he said in the interview			0
@entity139 talks to @entity2 about business , budgets and beliefs @entity2 , who was the president 's assistant , was left to help lead the mission , and under his watch the number of converts went up			1
back in @entity148 after he and @entity137 were married and they later settled in @entity148 , @entity2 became a church leader there			1
he would serve as head of the @entity154 , @entity155 , congregation and his duties included not only leading the service but also counseling people , comforting the sick and arranging financial help for those in need			1
" it 's an unusual part of my faith in that we do n't have a full - time ministry			2
there 's no one paid to be the pastor and conduct services on sunday and really no one who is full - time with the church to care for the sick and visit the poor			1
and so the church comes and says , ' we 'd like you to do that , @entity177 ' and so for about 10 years i took responsibility for the congregation or a group of congregations , and in that regard i was like the pastor			1
" this work and his later job of leading all of the @entity148 congregations will likely be highlighted during the @entity30 convention this week , in an attempt to show a more personal side of the nominee - to - be			0
" talk about a growing - up experience and a learning experience			0
you try your very best to align yourself with the @entity193 and what @entity20 might say , and of course you look to get direction from the church as well , " he told @entity14			2
@entity2 and the role of women his tenure was not without controversy			1
some women in the congregation have complained he did not do enough to give women a more prominent role in church activities			1
he said he worked hard to make the church inclusive			2
leading progressive group attacks @entity2 over women 's issues he also described @entity137 's diagnosis , in 1998 , of multiple sclerosis , a disease that can shut down the nervous system			1
family members and friends said that was a moment that rocked the family because @entity137 was known as the stabilizer of the family			0
he talked about the time when the couple went to the neurologist after @entity137 started having serious problems -- not knowing if the cause would be fatal			0
" it was very clear that she was flunking the examination			0
she could n't stand on her right foot without falling over and things like that			0
( the doctor ) stepped out and she began to cry and i welled up tears as well and we hugged each other , and she said , " something is terribly wrong , " and i said , " yes , but @entity137 , we can go through anything so long as it 's not fatal			2
" " for me , i love @entity137 , " he continued , " not because she can cook and not because she can fix things around the house			0
i love @entity137 because of who she is			0
and for me , as long as she was able to be alive , our life would be fine			2
" so with one of the couple 's five sons still at home , @entity2 started doing the household chores , picking up food at the grocery store and doing whatever was necessary			1
" she battled through it			0
she got good help from wonderful physicians and over the course of all the care she got she was able to stop the disease in its tracks			0
it 's relapsing and remitting in her case			2
it 's stopped and she 's been pretty solid ever since			2
but whether it has or not , just having her around makes my life complete			0
" in a separate and emotional wide - ranging interview , @entity266 described to @entity14 how the illness completely frightened her and how supportive her husband was			2
" even when i was as sick as that he would curl up in the bed with me , " she said			0
" it was like he was gon na do anything he could do just to say i 'm here			0
just stay right there , and we 'll be ok			0

@entity2 's missionary service in @entity17 as a teenager changed his life
he was thought to be dead after a tragic car accident that killed a *passenger*
as a church leader in @entity155 , his role " was like the pastor "
wife @entity266 's diagnosis in 1998 of multiple sclerosis also *strengthened* their bond
