when the @entity2 family started having serious health problems late in 2008 , they had no idea it was associated with what they call " a multitude " of drilling operations that popped up near their 40 - acre ranch in @entity11 , 60 miles northwest of @entity12			1
at first , @entity2 dismissed her migraine headaches , nausea and dizziness as the flu , but when her symptoms persistently got worse , she knew something more serious was involved			1
" by 2009 , i was having a multitude of problems , " @entity2 told @entity19			1
" my central nervous system was messed up			0
i could n't hear , and my vision was messed up			1
my entire body would shake inside			0
i was vomiting white foam in the mornings			1
" in 2009 , @entity2 's husband , @entity28 , and their 11 - year - old daughter , @entity29 , also became ill , suffering a laundry - list of symptoms			1
" they had nosebleeds , vision problems , nausea , rashes , blood pressure issues			1
being that the wells were not on our property , we had no idea that what they were doing on the property around us was affecting us , " she said			2
' private nuisance ' after a two - week trial that ended tuesday -- @entity49 , coincidentally -- a @entity12 jury awarded the @entity2 family $ 2.9 million for personal injury and property damages in the family 's lawsuit against @entity56 - based @entity55 according to the lawsuit , @entity55 had 22 natural gas wells within a 2 - mile radius of the @entity61 ' property , with three wells in close proximity to their @entity65 home			1
the closest was 791 feet away			0
as a result of poor management and lack of emission controls , @entity55 created a " private nuisance " to the @entity2 family by producing harmful air pollution and exposing them to harmful emissions of volatile organic compounds , toxic air pollutants and diesel exhaust , the lawsuit said			1
op - ed : make sure fracking is done right @entity55 argued to the jury that it consistently met state regulatory standards for air emissions and that there was no evidence its fracking of the wells harmed the @entity2 family in any way			1
in a statement released after the verdict , @entity87 said " natural gas development has long been prevalent in @entity91 , " and dozens of companies operate hundreds of wells there			1
the company further said it complied with state air - quality limits and that its experts made strong cases countering the @entity61 ' claims in court			1
" we contended the plaintiffs were neither harmed by the presence of our drilling operations nor was the value of their property diminished because of our natural gas development			2
we presented thorough and expert testimony from recognized toxicologists and medical professionals , as well as local real estate professionals , to help the jury make an informed decision , " @entity87 's statement said			1
" unfortunately , they returned a verdict that we believe is counter to the evidence presented			0
" an important precedent ? fracking , which is short for hydraulic fracturing , is the process by which drillers pump large amounts of water mixed with sand and chemicals into a shale or rock formation			2
the wells can be deeper than 8,000 feet , and the process fractures the shale around the well , allowing the natural gas in the shale to flow freely			2
interactive : how fracking works is energy independence a myth ? @entity2 said that she knew by july 2010 that the " loud operation " next door to their ranch was toxic			1
" one night , our whole house was vibrating and shaking			0
we lease that property for our cattle and so i went over there to make sure our cattle was n't around there , and when i went over there my nose and throat started burning			1
" @entity2 called the state commission on @entity154			2
" my doctor , an internal specialist , found 20 chemicals in my body and he said , ' @entity2 you must move immediately			2
you will spend more time and money on hospitals , chemotherapy , and a mortician ... and you need to get an environmental health doctor immediately , ' " she said			2
the @entity165 filed suit in march 2011 , asking for $ 66 million in damages against nine companies that were originally thought to be involved in the drilling operations			1
eventually , some of the energy companies were dismissed from the case , and some reached settlements before the trial			0
their identities can not be disclosed , according to the @entity165 ' @entity177 - based attorney , @entity176			2
during discovery , @entity176 said that " substantial evidence " showed that @entity55 was a factor in causing the @entity181 ' health problems			1
he said he believes the @entity181 ' court victory -- which he says is the first jury award for personal injury in a @entity187 fracking case -- " marks an important precedent for the future of natural gas production			0
" " because of their courage and determination for justice , the @entity61 have successfully held @entity194 accountable for their careless and reckless behavior , " he said			2
@entity196 : fracking has hot year in @entity198 @entity87 had a starkly different take on the verdict and left the door open to an appeal			1
" we thank the jury for its service , " the company said			2
" the facts of the case and the law as applied to those facts do not support the verdict			0
... talk of an appeal is premature			0
@entity87 has a number of arguments to be made in the trial court for why a judgment should be entered in its favor			2
" ' knee - jerk reaction ' ? attorneys who represent the energy sector and are familiar with @entity2 v. @entity194 say they do n't believe the case will set a precedent			1
nor will it establish a blueprint for " copycat " cases , they say			0
rather , they see this case as an anomaly due to the fact that it went to trial and addressed a rare nuisance allegation that evolved into a case revolving around personal injury from toxic exposure			0
@entity235 , a @entity12 - based attorney who represented a prior defendant in the case before that company was dismissed from the lawsuit , says she does n't think the @entity165 ' jury award will survive an appeal			1
" the knee - jerk reaction by people not understanding the limitations of this verdict in this case may , in fact , cause others to believe there is an avenue for cases that there may not ultimately turn out to be , " may said			0
" i do n't think it presents any precedents , certainly not from a legal perspective			0
i think the case is ripe for review by the appellate courts , and based on clear law that has been laid out by the @entity261 , a decision like this should not stand			0
" oiling on @entity265 reservations @entity266 , another environmental defense attorney , agrees with may that this is a one - off case because of the " situational " facts involved			0
" nuisance cases are very fact - specific , and because they are fact - specific , the results in one would not have implications for others , " @entity266 said			0
regardless , the @entity61 say they feel vindicated by the six - person jury 's decision after what they describe as a six - year nightmare of nonstop health issues			1
they 're now living at their ranch again and say that since @entity87 has put units on their well sites to clean the air -- and the well closest to them has been shut down -- they are feeling better			2
" with that being down , we 're better about staying here			0
now with this lawsuit being over , the curious question is whether they are going to shut this back on			0
that will determine if we have to move again			0
i do n't trust this company , " @entity2 said			1
asked about the prospect of a drawn - out appeals process , she says they 're ready for a fight and quotes one of her favorite musicians , @entity297 : " i stand my ground , and i wo n't back down			1
" " i am very pleased with the verdict			0
this was justice that was served not only for us , but for every family in the world who has suffered from health effects and the negligence from this type of industry , " she said			1
perhaps surprisingly to some , @entity2 says she 's not opposed to the work oil companies do			2
she simply wants them to do their business responsibly , she said			0
" we are not anti-fracking or anti-drilling			0
my goodness , we live in @entity65			0
keep it in the pipes , and if you have a leak or spill , report it and be respectful to your neighbors			0
if you are going to put this stuff in close proximity to homes , be respectful and careful			0

@entity2 family suffered from nosebleeds , rashes , vision problems , " vomiting white foam "

@entity87 says it did n't cause health problems or property damage ; company may appeal
asked about drawn - out appeals process , @entity2 quotes @entity297 : " i wo n't back down "
