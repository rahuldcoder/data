-- the 2013 box office has been stuck in a bit of a rut			0
for nine of the past ten weekends , overall grosses have lagged behind 2012 totals , and high - profile releases like " @entity8 , " " the host , " " @entity10 , " and " @entity11 " have badly misfired			0
that 's why industry folks are likely breathing a sigh of relief this morning looking at the box office chart			0
not only did " @entity18 " and " @entity19 " both open successfully , but six separate films earned over $ 10 million during the friday - to - sunday period			1
it 's an encouraging sign of industry health as @entity22 gears up for the lucrative summer movie season			0
" @entity18 , " a new remake of @entity27 's 1981 cult classic , led the way with $ 24.2 million			1
@entity28 is boasting a $ 26 million frame , which includes the $ 1.8 million the film earned at thursday night shows			2
the horror film scared up more in its opening weekend than " @entity33 , " which debuted to $ 21.7 million in january , but less than " mama , " which took of with $ 28.4 million in february			2
although " @entity18 " is already a big winner for @entity37 , @entity38 , and @entity39 , which made it for just $ 17 million , the film will have limited longevity in the weeks to come , as evidenced by its frontloaded performance thus far			1
" @entity18 " dropped 15 percent from friday ( $ 10.1 million ) to saturday ( $ 8.8 million ) , and a weak " @entity43 suggests the film is n't connecting with audiences outside its core horror - junkie demographic			1
" @entity18 " could return to the grave with about $ 50 million when all is said and done			1
the film 's success must be gratifying for @entity27 , who directed the original and has his own picture in the @entity52 this week — " @entity54 " finished in seventh place with $ 8.2 million and has now earned $ 454.1 million worldwide			1
' snl ' : @entity55 does it again @entity58 's $ 135 million animated hit " the @entity59 " continued to benefit from being the only family release in theaters right now			2
the cave people comedy dropped 21 percent in its third weekend to $ 21.1 million , giving it a $ 125.8 million total and lots of time to continue evolving			0
the @entity59 will easily surpass the domestic totals of @entity58 's most recent animated efforts , " @entity68 : @entity69 " ( $ 161.3 million ) and @entity70 ( $ 143.6 million ) , and if it maintains its slim week - to - week drops , it should finish close to $ 200 million			1
internationally , the film has already passed that mark with $ 206.8 million — $ 34.1 million of which came from this weekend			0
high - octane sequel " @entity76 : retaliation " tied " the @entity59 " for second place with $ 21.1 million — when studios report final numbers tomorrow , the exact rankings will be clarified			2
" @entity82 " fell 48 percent from its first weekend and has now commanded $ 86.7 million after 11 days			0
at the same point in its run , predecessor " @entity76 : the @entity89 " had earned $ 101.2 million , and the sequel will almost certainly fall short of " @entity87 's " $ 150.2 million domestic total			1
fortunately , @entity82 , which comes from studios @entity90 , @entity91 , and @entity92 , is making up ground internationally , where it has earned $ 145.2 million after only two weekends ( " @entity87 's " overseas total was $ 152.3 million ) , giving it $ 231.8 million globally			1
@entity95 wins @entity96 , salutes @entity97 for star @entity98 , who assumed the lead role in the " @entity76 " franchise , " @entity82 " is kicking off what 's sure to be an impressive few months of his box office career			0
on april 26 , his @entity104 action - collab " @entity106 " hits theaters , and on may 24 , surefire smash @entity107 will race to profitability			0
do you smell what @entity98 is cooking ? hits ! ( ok , with the exception of @entity113 , which only earned $ 41.8 million earlier this year			1
) @entity115 's re-release " @entity19 , " the latest entry in the @entity118 re-release fad kickstarted by " @entity119 " @entity19 's $ 94.1 million haul in 2011 , stomped away with $ 18.2 million in its first weekend			1
@entity122 screens accounted for $ 6 million of that figure			0
the dinosaur film ( read a wonderful oral history of it here ) had better start than @entity128 , which debuted to $ 17.3 million , but behind @entity129 : episode 1 -- the @entity131 , which opened with $ 22.4 million			2
all told , the @entity133 classic might score about $ 50 -- 60 million , a tremendous result considering it only cost @entity115 $ 10 million to convert to @entity19			1
@entity135 faints during ' @entity137 ' prep the presidential thriller " @entity139 " snuck past @entity141 's " temptation " to take fifth place , though both films earned about $ 10 million for the weekend			1
@entity144 dipped only 29 percent in its third weekend , giving it a $ 71.1 million total against a $ 70 million budget			0
the @entity148 action flick has proven to be a nice performer for star @entity150 , who was coming off a string of flops , as well as distributor @entity38			0
@entity144 has surpassed @entity153 ( $ 54 million total ) as the young studio 's biggest hit			2
@entity158 's temptation , meanwhile , stumbled 54 percent to $ 10 million , giving it a nice ten - day total of $ 38.3 million versus a $ 20 million budget			1
@entity18 -- $ 24.2 million 2			1
the @entity59 -- $ 21.1 million 2			0
@entity76 : retaliation -- $ 21 million 4			0
@entity19 -- $ 18.2 million 5			1
@entity139 -- $ 10 million 6			1
@entity161 -- $ 10 million in limited release , the @entity164 / @entity163 drama " @entity165 " continued to excel			1
this weekend , the film expanded from four to 30 theaters , where it earned $ 695,000 , giving it another scorching location average of $ 23,167			2
@entity171 plans to keep rolling out the $ 15 million film in the weeks to come			0
@entity176 's " trance " also opened in four theaters this weekend , and earned encouraging results			2
the film , which stars @entity178 , earned $ 136,000 — yielding a per theater average of $ 36,000			2
@entity180 plans to expand the film into 375 - 400 locations next weekend			0
