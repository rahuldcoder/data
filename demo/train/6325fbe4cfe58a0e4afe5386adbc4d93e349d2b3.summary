-- it was sunday morning that a fire broke out in the engine room on the @entity4 , leaving the ship adrift in the @entity6			1
the vessel eased into port thursday night			0
why did it take five days to rescue the 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew members on board ? the answer is not simple			2
it involves a handful of big decisions and some environmental factors outside anyone 's control			0
here are three reasons why the process has taken as long as it has : 1			0
@entity22 decided to tow the ship back to port			1
citing safety concerns , the company opted to tow the ship , rather than move passengers to another vessel			1
" we evaluated a wide range of options including using another ship to transport guests , but the safest solution was towing the ship back to port			0
we have a huge team involving multiple departments working around the clock to get our guests home as quickly as possible , " @entity4 said on its @entity37 page			1
spokesman @entity42 elaborated in an e-mail			0
see photos , tweets from the ship " regarding why we did n't use another cruise ship , we checked on this and all of our ships are in service right now , meaning that there are n't enough cabins available to accommodate more than 3,100 guests who are currently on the @entity4			1
additionally , a ship - to - ship transfer at sea would be considered too risky , " he said			0

strong currents pushed the ship north , prompting the company to change where the @entity4 would dock			1
after deciding the ship had to be towed , the cruise company chose as its destination the closest port , which was then @entity67 , @entity68			2
but soon after the decision was made , and before tugboats could take control , strong currents nudged the ship some 90 miles north , putting it nearly as close to @entity72 , @entity73 , as to @entity67			1
not so easy to sue cruise line " given the strength of the currents , it is preferable to head north to @entity72 , rather than attempt to tow against them , " the company said on its @entity37 page			1
the @entity81 port had another advantage			0
it provided easier re-entry for passengers and crew , particularly for the roughly 900 guests on board traveling without passports , @entity4 said			1
tears , big hugs as passengers reunite 3			0
the sheer size of the task is staggering			0
the @entity4 is a beast of a ship			2
it is 14 stories , nearly 900 feet long and is carrying more than 4,000 people			1
moving it anywhere takes a tremendous amount of time , energy and calculation			0
it traveled up a channel thursday toward @entity72 , a process that typically takes two to three hours			2
but because tugboats go slower than ships sailing at their normal speeds , that same trip was expected to take seven to 10 hours , said @entity42 , the @entity4 spokesman			2
five things we 've learned about cruising the journey was further delayed for four hours when the towline from the lead tugboat to the ship snapped , and another tug pushing the ship broke a bit			1
even once the ship docked , @entity4 officials said it would take four to five hours to get everyone off , which will likely seem like an eternity to those waiting to see loved ones			1
" we have to clear all of the decks , section by section , with first priority to guests with special needs and children , " said @entity42			0
" the entire process is quite involved , given that there are more than 3,100 passengers and nearly 1,100 crew , and this is compounded by the ship only operating on emergency power , " he said			0
opinion : how @entity4 can clean up the pr mess			0
