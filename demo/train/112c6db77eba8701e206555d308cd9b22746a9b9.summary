last week , the @entity0 issued a warning : the @entity3 holiday was coming up monday			2
so was @entity5 's birthday next sunday -- two events that could coincide with the increased possibility of violent attacks against jewish community centers			2
on sunday , that dire prediction came true			2
a 73 - year - old @entity12 man with a long resume of @entity14 and white supremacist activism is accused of opening fire outside two @entity9 centers in the @entity19 area			1
police say @entity21 killed a 14 - year - old boy and his grandfather in the parking lot of the @entity25 in @entity26 , and a 53 - year - old woman in the parking lot of the nearby @entity29 , also in @entity26			1
while authorities have n't disclosed any suspected motive , @entity21 -- who also goes by @entity21 -- has been active in the white supremacy movement since the 1970s			1
but after cooperating with federal authorities following an arrest in the mid- 1980s , he became an outcast among much of that community , the @entity0 said			2
the group described @entity21 -- referring to him by his pseudonym of @entity21 -- as " a perennial but peripheral figure " in the movement in recent years			1
attempts at launching white supremacist publications flopped , and the votes he received in a 2010 write - in bid for @entity47 failed to break the double - digit mark			1
3 dead in separate shootings sunday 's attacks come at a time when anti-semitic incidents in the @entity53 are at their lowest level in decades			2
in an audit released this month , the @entity0 reported 751 incidents in 2013 , down 19 % from the previous year			0
but while the number of total incidents dropped , there was a significant increase in violent anti-semitic assaults in 2013			0
the @entity0 audit recorded 31 anti-semitic assaults on @entity9 people or those perceived as @entity9 in 2013 , up from 17 in 2012			0
" the high number of violent in - your - face assaults , " said @entity0 national director @entity66 , " is a sobering reminder that , despite the overall decline in anti-semitic incidents , there is still a subset of @entity75 who are deeply infected with anti-semitism and who feel emboldened enough to act out their bigotry			0
" and @entity21 was " among the most - over - the - top , violent white supremacists " of the 1980s , said @entity81 , director of the @entity82 at @entity83 in @entity84			1
" he was one of the pioneers in the modern hate world , " he said			1
" he 's been entrenched in the hate movement his entire adult life			1
" @entity21 obtained the guns allegedly used in the shootings from a straw buyer -- a person with a clean background check who buys firearms on another person 's behalf , a @entity53 law enforcement official said monday			1
views shaped early a @entity101 who served 20 years in the @entity103 , including two tours in @entity105 , @entity21 has racist views that were shaped early in life , according to the @entity108 , which monitors hate groups			1
the @entity108 , like the @entity0 , referred to @entity110 by his pseudonym of @entity21			1
his father gave him a copy of a newspaper published by the @entity115 , and within two minutes , he said he knew he 'd found a home in the movement			1
who were the victims ? in the early 1980s , he founded and ran the @entity120			0
but instead of the traditional white robe of the @entity122 , he preferred fatigues and recruited active - duty soldiers as members			1
according to the @entity0 , which released a summary of its files on @entity130 on monday , the group " drew notoriety for its paramilitary training exercises " and was behind several attacks on african - americans during that era			0
@entity21 himself " was one of the more notorious white supremacists in the @entity53 " the @entity108 sued him for operating an illegal paramilitary organization and for intimidating @entity75			1
the two sides settled , with the @entity120 barred from operating			0
but a month later , @entity21 resurfaced with an offshoot : the @entity120			1
a kill list ? in 1986 , a @entity142 admitted selling the group anti-tank rockets , mines and explosives , according to the @entity108			0
because he founded another paramilitary group when a court forbade him to do so , @entity21 was found in criminal contempt and sentenced to six months in prison			1
he appealed , and then bolted			0
while underground , he sent supporters a kill list , to which he had assigned a point system , according to the @entity108 : blacks ( 1 point ) ; " white race traitors " ( 10 ) ; jews ( 10 ) ; judges ( 50 ) ; @entity108 founder @entity160 ( 888 )			1
the @entity161 caught up with him in @entity12 , where they tear - gassed him out of a mobile home			0
inside , they found a cache of weapons			0
cooperating with the feds he served three years in federal prison on weapons charges and for plotting robberies and the assassination of @entity160			0
the short sentence was a result of a plea bargain he struck with federal prosecutors			0
in exchange , he testified against 14 white supremacists in a sedition trial in @entity179 in 1988			1
" he was reviled in white supremacist circles as a ' race traitor ' and , for a while , kept a low profile , " according to an @entity108 profile of him			2
" now he 's making a comeback with @entity187 , a racist tabloid he 's been printing since 2005			0
" according to the @entity0 , the tabloid folded after two issues			0
but because both had large press runs , the copies were passed around for years			0

" according to the @entity108 , he received seven votes			0
racism meets religion according to @entity110 ' 1999 autobiography , he is an adherent of @entity213 , a neo-pagan religion that experts say has become one of the most vicious strains in the white supremacist movement			1
" i 'd love to see @entity222 's 100 million @entity221 @entity220 convert to the religion invented by their own race and practiced for a thousand generations before the @entity9 thought up @entity226 , " he wrote , describing @entity213 as " the religion for a strong heroic people			1
" in his autobiography , " a white man speaks out , " @entity21 wrote that he had prayed to the @entity231 to spark a race war in the @entity53			1
though @entity213 has been appropriated by white racists , most adherents are peaceful , earth - loving pagans , said @entity237 , an expert on white supremacists and a professor at @entity240 in @entity241 , @entity242 ' not a fringe character ' on saturday , @entity21 left for a casino in @entity12			1
